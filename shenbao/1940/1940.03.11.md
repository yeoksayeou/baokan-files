Chongqing: The Central Personnel Administration Conference held a discussion session at 8 AM on the 10th and the fourth plenary session at 2 PM.

Finally, President Dai led the attendees in reciting the Party members' code of conduct, after which the meeting adjourned, marking a successful conclusion to the conference. The general resolution is summarized as follows: (1) All achievements of this conference have been stated in the resolution. We hope that all competent authorities will exert their wisdom and abilities, and that all people in the country will make concerted efforts. (2) All resolutions of this conference shall be actively implemented by the responsible authorities, so as to achieve rapid, practical, and beneficial results. (3) China is currently in the most critical period of the War of Resistance, and the hardships faced by the people are unprecedented in history. However, the greatness of this era and the boundless brightness of our country's future are also unprecedented. Considering the real situation of China and Japan, the conditions for victory in the War of Resistance and the success of national reconstruction have been completely grasped by China, while Japan is showing signs of unprecedented chaos since its founding. From an administrative point of view, this can be determined with certainty. However, since ancient times, the prosperity of a country has depended on the correct awareness, belief, knowledge, and action of the people. This awareness, belief, knowledge, and action can only be achieved with one heart and one mind, under the guidance and command of a leader with great wisdom, benevolence, and courage. The path to our success lies clearly before us, and we have a leader with great wisdom, benevolence, and courage, who always puts the country first, takes the lead in hardship, and serves as a vanguard for the people, leading us forward. We have sworn to be a civil servant in the era of national reconstruction of the Republic of China. We must always and in all things act with the sincerity of our oath, the meaning of our oath, forgetting our families for the sake of the country, forgetting our personal interests for the sake of the public, dedicating ourselves to the great cause of the people and the country, so that its success will be certain for ten thousand generations.

Editorial

### The Evolution of Political Instability in Japan

A nation at war requires political stability above all else, because military affairs are merely an extension of politics, while politics is the driving force behind military affairs. If, during wartime, the attempt to unify national will and end political infighting fails despite earnest efforts, then there is fundamentally no possibility of maintaining victory in the external war. The situation in Japan today is precisely this.

The Sino-Japanese War has been underway for less than three years, and Japan has already seen four changes of cabinet. Among them, the Konoe cabinet was the longest-lived and had a relatively strong lineup of ministers, but it also repeatedly encountered political storms. The contention over the National Mobilization Law and the resignation of Foreign Minister Ugaki both posed significant threats to the Konoe cabinet. However, at that time, the invading forces in China were extending their battle lines and expanding the war zone, and most Japanese people were intoxicated by golden dreams of victory. Therefore, although those political fluctuations revealed the instability of the Japanese internal situation, they did not lead to serious consequences. Subsequently, the Hinuma and Abe administrations were staffed with unsound candidates, and their prestige declined further with each passing day. As a result, the life of the cabinet inevitably became shorter. By the time the Yonai cabinet was formed, the Japanese imperialism was already in decline. Military, diplomatic, and economic affairs were encountering unprecedented difficulties, and the people gradually changed from enthusiasm to doubt. Therefore, when Yonai came to power, the cheers from all sides were not as loud as they had been when previous new cabinets were formed. Some even made accusations with intimidating undertones in their resentment. In order to cope with the situation, Yonai requested that the Diet extend its session, intending to use the time to make careful arrangements in the hope of overcoming the difficulties. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of the reconvened Lower House, the Saito "gaffe" incident occurred, causing turmoil for more than a month and almost endangering the survival of the cabinet. It was not until the 7th of this month that the matter was resolved by expelling Saito, setting an unprecedented precedent in the history of the Japanese Diet. The problem then shifted to the Diet and political parties. On the one hand, the dignity of the Diet was completely lost, and the weaknesses of the political parties were fully exposed. Discussions about reorganizing the Diet and reforming political parties were rekindled. On the other hand, divisions arose within the Minseito and Seiyukai parties, and a crisis erupted within the Social Democratic Party. In particular, the party leader, Isoo Abe, clashed with the party cadres, almost leading to the ridiculous situation of requesting the party leader to leave the party. The trend of political parties regaining influence, which had emerged two months earlier, was completely reversed. Because the Japanese Diet and the political parties themselves intended to cater to social sentiment and express the feelings of the Japanese people, but lacked the courage and determination to carry out their demands, their failure and decline were inevitable. Whether advancing, retreating, gaining honor, or suffering disgrace, they are unlikely to have a significant impact on the current Japanese political situation. However, the occurrence of these phenomena is very noteworthy. At the very least, it indicates that the Japanese political situation is becoming more volatile, more divided, and is developing in the opposite direction of stability. The Japanese authorities' attempt to stabilize the political situation has undoubtedly proven to be a complete failure.

The main force opposing the Diet and the political parties is naturally the military, and the reasons for this are not difficult to understand. In recent times, the anxiety and dissatisfaction of the Japanese people have been growing day by day, and have begun to surface. The Diet and the political parties are preparing to take advantage of this situation to restore their lost powers and functions, which is naturally not what the military wants to hear. Therefore, they took advantage of the Saito incident to strike at the Diet's and the political parties' weakness of being timid and hesitant, indirectly suppressing the anxiety and dissatisfaction of the people. In fact, for people who are hungry and exhausted, merely using whips to suppress their unrest can only achieve temporary peace, and the effect will ultimately be limited. On the other hand, the method of釜底抽薪 [removing the firewood from under the cauldron, i.e. solving the root of the problem] is not welcomed by the bellicose military, and today Japan fundamentally lacks the statesmen who are capable of pulling back from the brink. As a result, one side continues to blindly go its own way, while the other engages in latent brewing. The future trend is not difficult to imagine. For more than a year, the stagnation of Japanese military power and the wavering of military morale have been mainly caused by this, and this will only become more severe in the future. A few days ago, it was rumored that the Japanese Minister of the Interior Yuasa and the Minister of the Imperial Household Matsumoto were both contemplating resignation. This is a major wave in the inner workings of the political establishment. If we only look at the matter from the surface, it seems that the arrogance of the勢力 [powerful factions] has risen to the extreme, even forcing the 元老重臣 [elder statesmen] in the central political circle to retreat. However, from a more subtle perspective, it is also possible to see this as a demonstration and warning by the 元老重臣 to urge the勢力 to reflect and restrain themselves. At the same time, although the Saito incident has temporarily come to an end under high pressure, similar political storms may well erupt again. Ms. Utley said: "In countries where the people lack political rights, the possibility of the people fighting for freedom and completing political and economic reforms only arises when divisions occur within the ruling class." Japan, which has suffered major blows in the military, diplomatic, and economic fields, has recently shown unprecedented political instability. The above-mentioned opportunity, even if it has not yet fully ripened, is probably not far off!

### According to Pittman, Far East Situation Expected to Improve; Japan Aware It Cannot Conquer China; Pittman Also Suggests 30-Day Truce in Europe

Washington: Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, announced yesterday that Japan is gradually realizing that it cannot conquer China, so the Asian situation is improving. Pittman, broadcasting to radio listeners on the world situation, suggested a 30-day truce in Europe to contribute to a peaceful solution in Asia. Pittman declared, "It is unimaginable that the belligerent nations would refuse a truce to calmly discuss the reasons for the war." President Roosevelt has sent Under Secretary of State Welles to Europe to secretly investigate the attitudes and purposes of the belligerent nations and, to the extent possible, find some way to use as a starting point for American efforts to stop the war and mediate the disputes. Some people think that Welles may unfortunately cause disputes, but his actions can prove that this mistake will not be made. In his speech, Pittman lamented the prevalence of "power politics" in the world today. He said, "Loyal, patriotic, and honest Finland has no reason to be invaded. Scandinavia is threatened with annihilation by two powerful countries. China is being destroyed by Japan without any legitimate excuse." But the situation in Asia seems to be gradually improving. "The Japanese know that they cannot conquer China. The enormous cost of the invasion is almost destroying Japan's currency and economic system. We hope that a satisfactory solution to the Sino-Japanese problem will eventually be achieved." (10th United Press dispatch)

Washington: Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently gave a radio address stating that Under Secretary of State Welles' visit to Europe is for the sake of peace and that he hopes that all European countries can have a 30-day truce so that peace talks can proceed calmly. In other words, the war between England and France and Germany, as well as the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, should be stopped. "The belligerent nations have repeatedly stated the reasons and objectives of their wars. Why are they unwilling to cease hostilities in order to calmly examine these reasons and objectives? This is truly unthinkable. If the belligerent nations reject our proposal, it would be tantamount to declaring the death penalty for civilization, with their own selfish interests as the premise. In short, I believe that neutral nations should step forward to make efforts for peace. During this truce period, if all the parties involved can eliminate all fears, then it will not be difficult for the neutral nations to act as mediators. But we know that when the war is actively underway, it is very difficult for the neutral nations to bring the belligerent nations closer together. We also know that the efforts of the neutral nations must be approved by both sides of the conflict in order to achieve satisfactory results. In the current situation, both sides of the conflict are sticking to their original positions and not making any concessions. In fact, in our view, the peace terms proposed by both sides of the conflict are tantamount to demanding the destruction of the other's economic life. These conditions are not only unnecessary, but also unreasonable, and there is room for discussion. In any case, if the current war is not ended before this summer, there is a risk that it will continue to the end." (10th Havas dispatch)

### Soviet Newspaper Analyzes Japanese Situation

Moscow: The News newspaper today published a long article analyzing the reasons why Japan is eager for peace. It claims that Japan is trying hard to establish peace in order to save itself from the current difficulties caused by the long-term war. The Japanese army in China has become increasingly trapped and has suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties, and the country has also fallen into great crisis. The Japanese army originally intended to complete the task in China with a brief (stroll), but unexpectedly it caused a long-term war of resistance, with daily consumption reaching 20 million yuan. If Wang Jingwei's government is successfully organized, it will harm the interests of various countries in China and undermine the rights enjoyed by various countries as stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty and other treaties. The United States is extremely opposed to Japan's plan, and American dignitaries have openly threatened to impose an embargo on Japan. If implemented, Japan will lose its main source of raw materials, and its military and economic strength will be greatly reduced. Therefore, Japan is extremely panicked. (10th dispatch)

Paris: U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles delivered a memorandum to Finance Minister Paul Reynaud today, stating that "U.S. foreign trade policy is based on the following three principles: (1) Establishing sound international business relations is a necessary foundation for achieving lasting peace and ensuring the welfare of all nations. Therefore, all nations must be able to access the world's resources through normal means. In other words, all nations can access resources not only within their own borders but also without discrimination to the resources of other nations. (2) International trade is difficult to develop if countries attempt to establish agreements that exclude or discriminate against the interests of third countries, raise tariffs, or control exchange rates. These business barriers are weapons of economic warfare. Past experience shows that they not only disrupt international trade in peacetime and affect the living standards and general economic welfare of all countries, but also become a cause of national animosity and international conflict. (3) After the current war ends, if the world wants to build a new world on the basis of lasting peace, eliminate all fear and hatred, and open up avenues for world economic progress, it is necessary to restore international trade on a sound basis. To implement the above two original ideas, various excessive and unreasonable business barriers imposed by countries on the flow of goods must be gradually eliminated. First, countries must not discriminate against the interests of third countries when implementing the "most-favored-nation clause" in commercial implementation. Second, countries must establish new exchange rate and credit systems to adapt to multifaceted trade methods. Third." (Havas, 9th)

Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano, Prince Don Prospero Colonna, Governor of Rome, and German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen were at the station to welcome him. Crowds gathered at the station, cheering and paying their respects. At 11:00 AM, he went to Palazzo Venezia to meet with Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, and they spoke for eighty minutes. Ciano and Mackensen were also present. Afterwards, according to an official statement, the conversation was very cordial and they will meet again tomorrow. It is also learned that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon. In addition, newspapers generally say that the German-Italian agreement originally stipulated that the authorities of both sides should contact each other from time to time. Therefore, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit is not surprising. The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, stated, "Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy to hold talks with the Italian authorities has no alarming significance. It is only a regular consultation between the authorities of the two countries." The newspaper Messaggero reported that "The relationship between Germany and Italy is very strong and vibrant. This can be seen from the recently concluded commercial agreement between the two sides." The Giornale d'Italia, the mouthpiece of Foreign Minister Ciano, reported that it is not true that Germany is forcing Italy to abandon its non-belligerent stance. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's trip was decided long ago, and its goal is only to conduct a comprehensive study of the current situation. (Havas, 10th)

Vatican City: The Vatican recently issued a statement saying that Pope Pius XII has accepted the request of the German Ambassador to the Vatican and decided to receive German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop at 11:00 AM on the 11th of this month. (Havas, 10th)

Rome: Political figures here have commented on German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's talks with Prime Minister Mussolini this morning. It is generally believed that Ribbentrop's mission has three main points: First, if Finland refuses the Soviet conditions, leading to a breakdown of the peace talks, Germany may use the pretext of Finland's war and rely on the assistance of Britain and France, causing Germany to feel threatened, and therefore take action against the Scandinavian Peninsula countries. If so, the German government urgently wants to know whether Italy will object. Second, what position should Italy take on Romania? Regardless of whether Romania accepts, Germany will control the oil produced in the country and negotiate with the Soviet Union on the issue of Romania's Bessarabia province (which belonged to Russia before the European War). Third, Germany is very willing to promote understanding between Italy and the Soviet Union. On this point, Ribbentrop will also state to Prime Minister Mussolini that after Bessarabia is returned to the Soviet Union, the country will not cross the Prut River (located between Bessarabia and Moldova) to continue expanding its power, so Italy does not need to worry. (Havas, 10th)

Rome: An official report on the meeting between Prime Minister Mussolini and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was released here this afternoon, stating: Prime Minister Mussolini received German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today and held talks for one hour and fifteen minutes. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen were present at the time. Mussolini is now scheduled to hold the first meeting with Ribbentrop tomorrow. (Haitong, 10th)

Berlin: The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung commented today on Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Italy, saying that this is a natural result of German-Italian political, economic, and cultural cooperation. The newspaper continued, "Germany is a belligerent country, but Italy is not an ordinary so-called neutral. When it declares its living space in the eastern Mediterranean, Italy takes a hostile attitude towards Western countries. When it declares its vital interests, its animosity towards Britain and France is the same as Germany's attitude in 1939." Therefore, the newspaper believes that Italy's position in the European War today is neither belligerent nor neutral. (Haitong, 10th)

Rome: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and his entourage of thirty-two people arrived here at 10:00 AM this morning. Political circles believe that the end of the Soviet-Finnish War, the reconciliation between Hitler and Pope Pius XII, and the establishment of a "joint defense" front among Italy, Germany and the Soviet Union will all be realized because of this trip by Ribbentrop. People here were already deeply moved by Berlin's sudden announcement of Ribbentrop's visit to Italy. Later, when they heard the official announcement that Pope Pius would receive Ribbentrop this afternoon, they were even more excited. They all believed that Führer Hitler would once again use his second "extraordinary hand." A senior official even said that Hitler's move "is quite logical, has a driving force, has an epoch-making nature, and is a sign of future developments." The next thirty-six hours will reveal what will happen in Rome, all in the above few words. According to reports, the members of Ribbentrop's delegation are the same personnel from the German Foreign Ministry who went to Moscow with him last autumn to sign the German-Soviet agreement. Therefore, reliable sources know why Hitler sent his foreign minister to Italy. They all said that the purpose of Ribbentrop's trip was to clear the "deck." These "decks" extend from the Murmansk coast to the Caucasus, from Moscow to Finland, and from Berlin to Rome and the Vatican. The church and Vatican were very excited when they heard that the Pope was preparing to receive Hitler's envoy. Everyone firmly believes that this formal meeting is a sign of harmony between the National Socialist Party and the Archbishop, or even a sign that Hitler will sign a treaty of friendship with Pius. Once this happens, it will undoubtedly be a great victory for Hitler, because British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax have always said that Hitler's words cannot be trusted, so they do not want to negotiate peace with him. Now, if Pope Pius signs the newly revised friendship treaty, it is equivalent to acknowledging Hitler's credibility and acting as his guarantor. As for the restoration of trade between Rome and Moscow, if the Soviet-Finnish War stops, it can proceed smoothly. It is heard that Italy once asked the Soviet Union to purchase coal and oil but was rejected. It is speculated that the reason is probably because Italian newspapers attacked the Soviet Union. According to diplomatic circles, although Sweden is mediating the Soviet-Finnish War on the surface, the figures behind the scenes are Hitler and his supporter Mussolini, because the famous Swedish explorer Sven Hedin and former Finnish President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud are both in Berlin, and the German ministers to Finland and Sweden are active in both countries. If we look into Hitler's intentions, other than Stalin and Mussolini, no one else should be rejected. This is nothing else, but the combined populations of Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union are two hundred million. Once the "joint defense" front is established, it will be impossible for enemies to resist when the manpower and material resources of the three countries come to the world. It is heard that the plan for Ribbentrop's visit to Rome was first discussed by Ribbentrop and Ciano, and then jointly decided by Mussolini and Hitler. The reason why this secret news was only revealed yesterday is because of this. It is also heard that Mussolini was furious after Britain detained ships carrying German coal to Italy, so he urgently invited Ribbentrop to Rome to discuss everything. Among Ribbentrop's delegation were Germany's top legal experts, who drafted the Soviet-German agreement. From this, it can be seen that Germany and Italy may have already had some kind of agreement. This time, they are likely to sign the exchange of important documents first to replace the drafts. German economic expert Clodius also accompanied Ribbentrop to Italy, and his task was to discuss how to increase the transportation of coal to Italy through three major railways. In short, Ribbentrop's visit to Rome has two major goals: First, Germany wants to reconcile with Pope Pius; second, Hitler wants to prevent Stalin from making excessive demands so that the Soviet-Finnish War can be concluded as soon as possible. If Hitler can achieve his goals, people here will think that this is Hitler's greatest victory in his life and will increase his advantage over Britain and France. Whether Hitler succeeds or fails, the clues should be revealed in the next forty-eight hours. (International News Agency, 10th)

### British-Italian Dispute Resolved: Detained Italian Ships Begin to Be Released

Rome: The dispute between Britain and Italy over German coal has been resolved. The Italian government recently issued a statement, the content of which is roughly the same as that issued by the British government, stating that the British government has decided to release thirteen of our ships. This matter has been informed by British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine to Foreign Minister Ciano. As for our ships that have not yet loaded German coal, they can only load ballast and return to their country. Afterwards, no more cargo ships shall be sent to transport German coal. (Havas, 9th)

Rome: After the British government decided to release thirteen Italian ships, political figures here have had a good impression, but they have not regarded it as unusual, because various news received in the past 24 hours have made people believe that this matter can be resolved satisfactorily. The same people also said that the British showing a compromising attitude towards Italy can be seen from this, and British-Italian commercial negotiations will therefore have the hope of success. (Havas)

London: After several Italian ships loaded with German coal sailed back to Italy from the Dutch port of Rotterdam and were ordered by British warships to sail to Cowes for inspection, the official Xuan Cheng said that the British government has decided to release all thirteen Italian ships. This decision has been notified by British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. As for Italian ships that are still in the port of Rotterdam or other ports and have not yet sailed, they may be allowed to sail back to Italy, but they can only load ballast. From now on, the Italian authorities must not send more cargo ships to the port to transport German coal. (Havas, 9th)

London: After the government decided to release thirteen Italian ships, political figures in Italy have had a good impression. Political figures here feel interested after hearing about it, but they believe that British-Italian commercial negotiations still have many difficulties and the future is not optimistic. The most important of these is the issue of Italy selling arms to Britain, but according to the Italian side, this matter may be possible to conclude an agreement. (Havas, 9th)

### German Memorial Day for Fallen Soldiers: Hitler Exhorts the People: Demands that the Germanic Nation Strengthen Unity: Strive for the Most Glorious Victory in History

Berlin: Hitler delivered a speech at the memorial service for fallen soldiers held in Berlin today, declaring his firm determination to defend National Socialist Germany and resist the rulers of British and French capitalism. The site was formerly Berlin's arsenal, but has now been converted into a war museum. Hitler said that he had been preparing for fifteen years to reach out to the world to achieve fair conditions, but the world refused to base agreements between countries on the concept of equal rights. As a soldier of National Socialism, he has always cherished the goal of winning rights for Germany by peaceful means or, if necessary, by force. As the leader of the country and commander-in-chief of the army, his only responsibility today is to concentrate day and night on seeking victory, but it is through our own work that we seek it, and if necessary, we will not hesitate to sacrifice our own lives. He knows that the future of Germany in the coming centuries will depend on this decisive war. Because he was a private in the last war, his only prayer to God today is to end this great national struggle for the Germanic nation with honor. If so, the spirits of the fallen soldiers of the past will rise from their graves to thank those who are repairing everything that was destroyed in weakness with loyalty and courage today. Therefore, we solemnly declare today that this decisive war, which was forced on Greater Germany by the rulers of British and French capitalism, must be turned into the most glorious victory in German history. Hitler spoke in a sincere tone for fifteen minutes, which was completely different from his past speeches, which were often eloquent. After the speech, Hitler entered the hall and placed a wreath in front of the monument to the fallen soldiers, then saluted the old soldiers of the Great War. Afterwards, he stood in front of the hall and received salutes from several army teams.

Minister of Aviation Hermann Göring, Commander-in-Chief of the Army Walther von Brauchitsch, and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Erich Raeder accompanied Hitler. Hitler's speech began by stating that the German people are celebrating Memorial Day for fallen soldiers in serious times. He went on to say that after gaining an unparalleled victory in the East, soldiers from various army divisions, sailors from warships, and pilots from the air force are now ready to defend Germany and resist the old enemies in the West, with the support of the entire nation. The divisionists and destructive forces in the country have now been completely eliminated. The entire Germanic nation is appearing before the solemn God to pray for blessings for the struggle for survival. This is still the first time in our history. Today, the soldiers' battles are particularly difficult, because soldiers often represent the essence of the nation. They put their lives at risk, and if necessary, they must sacrifice their lives so that the lives of their fellow countrymen can be kept safe and future generations can be guaranteed to survive. When God is weighing the value of all nations, the soldiers appear before the sacred tribunal of the solemn God. He praised the magnificence of the soldiers' sacrifices, saying, "The world knows the greatness of sacrifice, because sacrifice is enough to distinguish between the shameless egoist and the believer in doctrine; one is condemned as a coward, and the other is praised as a hero. The people in the world who deserve to celebrate their heroes are none other than the Germans. If we can lead historical life for more than two thousand years, it is only because the people of our country are always prepared to sacrifice their lives for the entire nation. If we do not have the same determination as our ancestors and are not as brave as them, then we have no right to come to this hall today. The courage expressed by politicians in the past is no less than the courage we expect from you today. Therefore, today we celebrate the memory of our heroes with new and noble feelings in our hearts, not bowing our heads, but proudly raising our eyebrows to pay our respects. And we have our own character, because we are ready to accomplish the same achievements as the martyrs, and we are willing to make the same sacrifices if necessary. The destiny and future of the whole are higher than the destiny and future of the individual. The highest degree of happiness belongs to this whole, so we must work hard to defend it." The plutocratic democratic countries have declared war on the National Socialist Germany and have the purpose of destroying Germany as their war objective. This only proves the value of our idea of ​​collective happiness, because this idea makes the German people indestructible and makes our enemies tremble. The unity of the German people is based on red blood, which is higher than class struggles and occupations. The German people have been able to endure for centuries because of this red-blooded unity. The whole world now wants to destroy us, but we only have one word to answer: defend the largest whole of all ages. This is a new redundancy. (Reuters, 10th)

Bucharest: The Romanian "Folia Kerosene Company" (capital of 5 million Lei) borrowed 32 million Belgian francs from a Belgian company. The company has now transferred this debt to a German banking syndicate in Berlin, giving Germany another opportunity to control the kerosene industry in Romania. The Folia Kerosene Company’s output last year was 120,000 tons. (Havas, 9th)

The Dublin government has instructed the responsible authorities to take necessary measures to resolve the strike wave. (Haitong, 10th)

### Soviet-Finnish Armistice Negotiations Underway; Partial Border Issues Reportedly Resolved; Finnish Public Opinion Firmly Upholds Independence

Stockholm: Neutral diplomatic circles here claimed last night that they expect a joint Finnish resolution to be announced this morning. According to reliable sources, the Soviet conditions do not include the cession of Vyborg. The Soviet Union requires a part of the Karelian Isthmus to "ensure the safety of Leningrad" and did not insist on occupying the entire Mannerheim Line. In the current situation, the purpose of the negotiations is to establish an armistice, not to negotiate complete conditions. All conditions will be included in the treaty signed by the two delegations. Soviet sources claimed that the Soviet ambassador to Sweden, Alexandra Kollontai, is not involved in the current negotiations, which are being conducted directly with the Soviet Foreign Ministry. (Associated Press, 10th)

Rome: According to a Swedish dispatch, the main points of discussion in the Soviet-Finnish peace negotiations are the ownership of the Hanko Peninsula and the land northeast of Lake Ladoga. As for the issues of the Petsamo area on the Arctic coast and the Karelian border, compromises have been reached. The Soviet Union has also recognized Finland's independence in principle and will abandon its attempt to support the puppet government led by Otto Wille Kuusinen. It is reported that after the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish war, within a few days, Communist leader Kuusinen declared the establishment of the Finnish People's Government in a Finnish town on the Soviet border, appointing himself as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. (Reuters, 10th)

Edinburgh: Diplomatic officials here stated that the Finnish plenipotentiaries are now conducting peace negotiations with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow. (Haitong, 10th)

The Hague: It is reported that the delegation sent by the Finnish government has indeed arrived in Moscow today, or has already contacted the Soviet authorities. Informed sources in the Scandinavian countries emphasize that the peace conditions proposed by the Soviet Union this time are not as harsh as initially reported. Therefore, newspapers in these countries all hope that the Finnish government will sacrifice some interests to end the current war and prevent German aid to the Soviet Union. (Havas, 9th)

Helsinki: Regarding the situation of the Finnish-Soviet negotiations, political figures here still maintain a reserved attitude. No newspapers have mentioned the Finnish delegation's visit to Moscow, so the list of delegation members is unknown. However, responsible parties have confirmed that Finnish public opinion is still firmly rejecting the peace conditions proposed by the Soviet government, preferring to fight to the end. (Havas, 9th)

Helsinki: According to news received from China News Agency, Finnish Commander-in-Chief Marshal Mannerheim has departed from the front line to return to the capital. Because the Finnish government is now divided into two factions on the overall situation, one advocating immediate peace talks and the other advocating applying for British and French intervention. Therefore, not only the fate of Finland, but also that of Norway and Sweden, will be decided this week. The current Foreign Minister Tanner and former Foreign Minister and current representative in Stockholm, Erkko, both advocate calling for British and French intervention. However, Prime Minister Ryti and cabinet member Paasikivi are scheduled to begin negotiations in Moscow today. Political figures predict that if the opinions of the two sides remain firm, then Marshal Mannerheim may, in order to unify opinions and settle disputes, exclusively wield military and political power within a certain limited period. (Haitong, 10th)

Stockholm: A correspondent for the Stockholm Times in Helsinki cabled that Finnish public opinion unanimously advocates maintaining territorial integrity and independent sovereignty and is determined not to become a pawn in an international poker game. The Soviet authorities have already expressed their willingness to conduct peace talks, but Finland will not easily cease fire until the Soviet Union proposes acceptable conditions. In other words, if the Soviet conditions are similar to those proposed last autumn, or even harsher, then Finland is determined to fight to the end. Generally, it is believed that the Soviet Union may reduce its conditions due to the dual impact of unstable situations and heavy losses in the war, so that Finland can negotiate with it. (Havas, 10th)

London: Italian radio recently broadcasted a message stating that, according to the latest news from Stockholm, the Finnish government seems to consider the peace conditions proposed by the Soviet Union unacceptable. As for the war situation, although the war reports released by Finland and the Soviet Union are very contradictory, there is no doubt that Finland would rather fight to the last person than sacrifice its independence. (Havas, 10th)

### U.S. President Has Not Abandoned European Peace Movement; U.S. Ambassador to Soviet Union Visits Molotov to Inquire About the Truth of the Soviet-Finnish Situation

Washington: White House spokesman Early stated yesterday that President Roosevelt has not yet abandoned his efforts for the European peace movement. Secretary of State Hull said that the current Soviet-Finnish situation is extremely confusing. Last Friday, the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union visited Molotov to request an explanation of the truth of the Soviet-Finnish situation. (Associated Press, 10th)

Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union has reported to the State Department on his March 8 conversation with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The report summarizes the facts, rumors, and contradictory information regarding the Soviet-Finnish situation, but does not contain Molotov's mediation methods or other proposals. Although there are various rumors here regarding the U.S. involvement in Finnish negotiations, informed sources also say that Under Secretary of State Welles's mission may be related to the Finnish issue. The person promoting Welles's efforts is Swedish steel magnate Wenner-Gren, who recently traveled to Washington and is reportedly on his way to Berlin. According to some people here, the U.S. authorities are very willing to see the restoration of peace in Finland, but are unwilling to put pressure on the Finns to force them to accept harsh conditions. (Reuters, 10th)

Washington: According to informed sources here, the attitude adopted by the U.S. government is to avoid participating, directly or indirectly, in any negotiations used to end the Soviet-Finnish war. This attitude has been confirmed by Secretary of State Hull. Diplomatic officials say that Finland alone has the right to decide how to deal with the future, and no other country can interfere. At this point, the promise of active British and French aid to Finland has become increasingly concrete. It is hoped that the country will be encouraged to resist the pressure exerted on it by Germany and Sweden. (Havas, 9th)

Washington: Political figures here are closely watching attempts to mediate the Soviet-Finnish conflict and say that the United States will maintain its role as a neutral observer. (Haitong, 10th)

Moscow: Since the news of the Soviet-Finnish peace talks spread, diplomatic circles here have become active. Ambassadors from various countries have been inquiring about the truth from the U.S. Embassy and the Swedish Embassy. It is reported that the Finnish Prime Minister has taken the opportunity to arrive here, but this has not been confirmed. The Soviet authorities are keeping silent about the peace talks. (Associated Press, 10th)

### Britain and France Proceed with Aid to Finland; Negotiating with Norway and Sweden

London: Informed sources say that Britain and France are negotiating with Norway and Sweden, asking whether the two countries would allow Britain and France to pass through their territories on a large scale to aid Finland if the Finnish government refuses to accept the peace terms proposed by the Soviet Union. If the two countries do not allow passage, are Britain and France prepared to directly aid Finland if necessary? Officials here have not made any statements. It is reported that Britain and France have notified the Finnish government of the negotiation process. The reason for continuing to exchange views with Norway and Sweden is to hope that these countries will take a firm stand and jointly share the responsibility in the event that Finland is defeated. (Havas, 9th)

Brussels: People in the streets of Paris and national newspapers are focusing on discussing the issue of Soviet-Finnish peace talks. The French cabinet also convened a meeting yesterday with the theme of discussing the Soviet-Finnish issue. It is widely believed that the Soviet-Finnish issue will also cause a fierce debate when the House of Representatives meets on the 12th. Newspaper commentaries generally fantasize that the Allied countries can defeat the Finnish people's determination to continue fighting and unanimously believe that if Finland continues to fight against the Soviet Union, the Allied countries will definitely provide military aid. At the same time, various newspapers severely criticize Sweden and Germany for mediating in the matter. "L'Ordre" said that since March 1, Britain and France were determined to fulfill their intervention promises, which led Sweden and Germany to take this step in an attempt to prevent British and French aid to Finland. Paris "Le Matin" also said that Finnish Embassy officials in France believe that Finland will not surrender. Other French newspapers unanimously advocate openly intervening in the Soviet-Finnish conflict and immediately aiding Finland. (Haitong, 10th)

Stockholm: Swedish radio broadcasted a report in English last night, refuting Britain and France's attacks on Sweden's attitude towards the Soviet-Finnish conflict, solemnly stating that all of Sweden's actions are in accordance with the obligations of a neutral country. If Britain and France blame Sweden for not jointly aiding Finland, then Sweden solemnly states that it will not tolerate any intervention from Britain and France. (Reuters, 10th)

### Finnish Refugees Continuously Flee to Sweden

Haparanda: Finnish refugees continuously crossing the border into Sweden are increasing in number, especially children. Personnel from the Finnish Central Foundation are currently processing refugee entry matters day and night and are extremely busy. (Reuters, 10th)

### Italy's View on the Soviet-Finnish Issue Aligns with Germany's; Believes that Finland's Main Interests Should Be Considered; Rumors that the German Foreign Minister Will Ask Italy to Mediate

Rome: Foreign observers recently stated that Italy's view on the Soviet-Finnish peace talks is clearly completely consistent with Germany's. Italian officials say that Italy has always been unwilling to expand the scope of the current European war, and this has been and will continue to be the case. At the same time, they sincerely hope that Finland can obtain honorable peace conditions from the Soviet Union. In other words, although Italy hopes for peace, it believes that Finland's main interests should also be taken into account. (Havas, 9th)

Berlin: It is claimed here that former Finnish President Svinhufvud will leave Berlin for Rome tonight. As of last night, he had not yet visited Führer Hitler. (Haitong, 10th)

The Hague: Foreign observers in Berlin recently stated that certain German parties advocate that the country should jointly guarantee Finland's independent sovereignty with the Scandinavian countries as one of the conditions for a ceasefire between the Soviet Union and Finland. (Havas, 9th)

Berlin: "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" published an article yesterday, commenting on attempts to mediate the Soviet-Finnish conflict, believing that the seventh month of the Soviet-Finnish war has reached a decisive stage. Whether the war continues indicates whether Britain and France's plan to expand the war has succeeded. The newspaper pointed out that Britain and France have repeatedly stated that the Allied forces have the right to pass through Norway and Denmark. In fact, Norway and Denmark declared years ago that they opposed Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. Since the end of the war in Poland, Germany has hoped to achieve peace and does not want the war zone to expand. It expresses its support for mediating the Soviet-Finnish war. (Haitong, 10th)

London: Informed sources say that the German Foreign Minister's trip to Rome is related to the Finnish-Soviet peace talks. It is likely that he wants to find a way to encourage Italy to jointly mediate. If Italy can participate in the mediation, then no matter what conditions the Soviet Union proposes, Finland will find it even more difficult to refuse. In addition, the German Foreign Minister will pay a visit to Pope Pius XII on the 11th. Some observers here, after hearing about it, all said that Germany wants to use the opportunity to mediate the Finnish-Soviet war to further seek peace talks with Britain and France. However, British officials all scoff at this idea, believing that in the current situation, there is no room for negotiations with Germany, whether directly or indirectly. The Vatican and other neutral countries are also well aware of Britain and France's views. (Havas, 9th)

### Soviet-Finnish War Reports: Soviet Forces Continue Offensive in Western Karelia

Helsinki: According to the latest news, the two armies advancing across the ice in Vyborg Bay have established a bridgehead ten miles long and three miles wide on the west bank of the bay. However, the Soviet army's attempt to expand its front line across the peninsulas east of Tuppura has not yet succeeded. The main points of the Soviet offensive are in the Muolaa and Villaniemi areas, and the fighting is quite fierce. According to the latest Finnish communique, the enemy continues to put pressure on the Finnish positions in Vyborg Bay. Attacks on the northeast coast of the bay and on several islands south and southeast of Vyborg were repulsed. The enemy forces attacking in central and eastern Karelia were also repulsed, suffering heavy losses, destroying fifteen tanks and several artillery pieces. The enemy fiercely attacked Kolankylä, suffered losses, and retreated. The enemy forces attacking Kuhmo were also repulsed. The Finnish army captured a strong stronghold, captured twenty-five Soviet soldiers, and seized many war materials.

Hygiene for Men and Women

### The More Beautiful a Wife's Appearance, the More She Needs Her Husband's Comfort

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of Russian Labor University

As the saying goes, "A skillful woman does not sleep with a clumsy husband." Although this is a saying, it can be inferred that the union of husband and wife must seek equality in character to be permanent. A woman with an overly beautiful appearance has a stronger reproductive desire. According to the German physiologist Professor Blum, a beautiful woman is sure to be a passionate lady. If she is married to a weak husband or a husband with an incompatible appearance, conflicts often arise, making it difficult to get along harmoniously.

Based on their research experience, most doctors know that the husbands of generally beautiful wives cannot satisfy their desire for love. This is entirely because the husband's reproductive function cannot match the wife's beauty. Now that we understand the reason, it is not difficult to devise appropriate and effective countermeasures to save this crisis.

It must be understood that if reproductive function becomes pathological, the loss in love is inestimable. This is a fact known to everyone. After the husband is full of energy, he can inspire his wife's interest, with mutual love and affection, as if they had met too late. Therefore, to demand harmonious and lasting love, it is imperative to pay close attention to physical strength and healthy reproductive function. Otherwise, even gold cannot buy a wife's love. It is common for wealthy men with wives and concubines to have affairs because of their weak energy. This is due to the husband's weak sexual function, which is not surprising.

The symptoms of weak sexual function include premature ejaculation, impotence, local smallness, nocturnal emission, and spermatorrhea. All of these are clear evidence that sexual function is unable to bear reproductive responsibility. After marriage, infertility is common. To eliminate this problem, we can only use the progress of science and medicine. Internally, take genuine and potent animal testicle "Xiutikang," invented by physiologist Dr. Mellen of Kangguo. In addition to animal gonadal hormones, its ingredients include brain-nourishing phosphorus, bone-nourishing calcium, and blood-nourishing iron. Therefore, it is effective for injuries before marriage, loss of health after marriage, and poor sexual performance. It can prosper the limbs and increase body weight. Its female version regulates menstruation and promotes conception. "Butikang" is most suitable for those who have beautiful wives but feel insufficient energy.

Gonorrhea Spring and Autumn

### The Latest Treatment for Gonorrhea

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

The methods for treating gonorrhea can be described as vastly different, but in terms of actual effectiveness, they are more harmful than helpful, and a satisfactory solution has never been found. The original pathogen of gonorrhea is the diplococcus, which has strong antitoxic power. Mild bactericides can hardly move it, while internal medicines with strong medicinal properties will damage the health of the stomach and intestines. Therefore, general inferior medicines on the market often irritate the stomach and intestines, causing severe vomiting after taking them. Patients and doctors are now aware of these types of medicines and avoid using them. As for local penetrating bactericides, their effects are limited to a corner and do not penetrate deeply, so they are also ineffective.

In this situation, there is a very gratifying new invention. German gonorrhea master Dr. Peter used new scientific research methods to completely solve the problem. With the latest chemical therapy, he has taken further research to develop "New Kerning." Although this agent is also made with chemical therapy, the chemical components it contains are vastly different from those of general chemical therapy. This is because the chemical components of "Kerning" have no adverse reactions and there is no need for any kind of worry. General chemical therapies on the market, after taking them, cause reactions such as a bluish face and mental uneasiness, and they are only effective during acute gonorrhea. In the chronic stage of gonorrhea, these market chemical therapy preparations lose their effectiveness. In addition, they are often inconvenient to take. "New Kerning" avoids all of the above shortcomings. Because "New Kerning" is made of pure ingredients and has no reactions after taking it, it has a definite and accurate effect on both new and old leukorrhea. It can be called the champion of gonorrhea chemical therapies. For all kinds of gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, cystitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, and arthritis, taking "New Kerning" can absolutely cure them and has no adverse side effects. ("New Kerning" is sold in Taihe and Zhengwei drug stores.)

### Lung Disease Cured: A Case Study

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

The patient, Yin Shiliang, 22 years old, resides on the West Road of this city. (Self-report) - I suffered from a cold the year before last, with a stuffy nose, headache, cough, and chest tightness. Although the surface symptoms were relieved with medication, the cough persisted, and I also had difficulty expectorating phlegm. I did not seek medical treatment. By last spring, the purulent phlegm increased, and blood spots were often found. I had night sweats at night, and the fever gradually increased. I am begging for treatment. (Treatment process) - I instructed him to rest quietly at home, eat more nutritious food, and take "Lung Supplemental Narl." After Mr. Yin tried three bottles, his appetite greatly increased, his cough sharply decreased, the purulent phlegm thinned, and no blood spots were found. The fever decreased, and he could sleep soundly at night. Therefore, he continued to take several bottles of "Lung Supplemental Narl." The dangerous lung disease has been completely cured. With further recuperation, his body became strong.

### Masturbation, Nocturnal Emission, Early Marriage, and Weak Constitution

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

Reports of Patients Cured

Patient Yang Shunzhong, 25 years old, resides in Sande Fang, Kang Nao Tuo Road. (Self-report) - At the age of eighteen, I was anesthetized by medical books and began to masturbate. Over time, it became a habit, and my energy was greatly depleted. The frequency of nocturnal emissions and spermatorrhea was frequent. Recently, I have also experienced symptoms such as tinnitus and insomnia. I began to panic and beg for treatment. (Treatment process) - In addition to electrotherapy, Dr. Zheng used a German medicine specifically for nocturnal emission, "Andros Spermatorrhea Tablets," to stop his spermatorrhea. After a month of recuperation, the spermatorrhea was gone. He also used a preparation made from the essence of male animal testicles, "Body Supplement Kang," to nourish the depletion. In less than two months, all his symptoms disappeared, and his weight had increased by six pounds.

Patient Tao Cichang, from Jiashan, Zhejiang, 24 years old, suffered from congenital deficiency, coupled with early marriage, which led to a variety of diseases, making him look like an old man. Besides being afraid of cold, he was also afraid of exertion and disliked noise. His appetite was also poor, and he was mentally distracted, often forgetting things, restless, had heart palpitations, and blurred vision. Knowing that if this continued, his life would be short, he specially came to me for treatment with his wife's protective gear. (Treatment process) - I knew that the root of his disease was the exhaustion of his essence and the loss of vitality of his reproductive glands. Therefore, I actively used the German "Body Supplement Kang" to nourish him. After taking it for three months, the symptoms of physical weakness were greatly reduced, his complexion was ruddy, and tinnitus and blurred vision were eliminated. Recently, his weight has reached 108 pounds, up from only 95 pounds before treatment.

Gonorrhea Discussion

### New Therapies for Persistent Gonorrhea

Yao Ju, Consultation at the Chan Clinic, No. 9 Sichuan Road, Ningbo Branch

It is best to treat gonorrhea before it becomes chronic.

Once it becomes chronic, you must pay attention to comprehensive and effective treatment.

Gonorrhea is a difficult venereal disease to treat because the pathogenic bacteria of gonorrhea—namely diplococci—have a very tenacious fighting ability and can hide in deep and obscure places. Therefore, most gonorrhea patients suffer from persistent and difficult-to-cure conditions. Therefore, a certain treatment method should be used in the acute stage of gonorrhea, but it is not to say that once acute gonorrhea is over, the symptoms of persistent gonorrhea are untreatable. The practical responsibility for treating gonorrhea is how to prevent the invasion of gonococci, and once they have penetrated deeply, how to quickly eliminate them to cut off their reproduction, so as to avoid the futile struggle that consumes the patient's strength.

The key to success or failure in treating gonorrhea lies in the method. It is a matter of life and death whether gonorrhea can be cured. Generally speaking, this disease should first be treated with a detailed diagnosis to find the root cause, and then the medicine should be administered to avoid owing debts. Therefore, when diagnosing gonorrhea, doctors should not "rely on experience" and assume expertise but should still carefully diagnose and treat it.

However, the treatment of gonococci must use a comprehensive therapy to prevent the bacteria from escaping. German electrostatic therapy targets the nests of gonococci and has a thorough and complete elimination effect. Combined with the internal administration of the special gonorrhea medicine "New Kleenon" (available in both Chinese and Western pharmacies, Taihe also sells it), the two difficulties can be overcome at the same time because "New Kleenon" can travel in our blood, capturing gonococci, and on the other hand, stimulate the body's blood and cells to produce an antibody lymphocyte phagocytic effect. Therefore, even persistent and intractable gonorrhea can be quickly cured.

Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen each day. Each number costs only five corners and comes with a complimentary copy of "The Complete Book of Venereal Diseases," worth one yuan.

### Savior for Stomach Problems

The stomach is the organ that supplies nutrition to the whole body. Therefore, people with stomach problems are mostly deficient in nutrition, resulting in various diseases, such as stomach pain, vomiting, constipation, and so on. The sacred medicine for stomach problems, "Strengthening Stomach Essence," has a miraculous effect on all stomach problems. It can also promote appetite and supplement nutrition. The most famous preparation from Sheng Yifang. Yong'an Company, Zheng Youzhong, West Road.

### German Child Welfare and Long-Distance Wedding

— Translated by Li Chenglin

After the German government took power under the National Socialist Party, it concentrated its efforts on increasing child welfare. Democratic countries with sufficient financial resources have not yet mentioned this important issue. The totalitarian country with scarce resources has already achieved satisfactory results. The hope of the country rests on the children of future generations. We should first compare the following figures. Germany's excess birth rate per thousand people per year is eleven, and Britain's is fifteen. While the birth rate of the United States remains stagnant, Germany has made full use of money and science to increase the well-being of children and mothers. In contrast, Britain, despite its wealth, still has many poor and sick children. The British government has also admitted that 72% of children in Sussex fall below the standards set by the British Medical Association. Currently, the European war has broken out, but Germany is still determined to maintain an increasing birth rate. Hitler is shown instructing the bride to sign the marriage certificate at the marriage registry, with a steel helmet placed beside her as a symbol of the groom. (Right corner) When the bride signs the certificate, the groom is still at the front line. The head of state has approved frontline soldiers to hold weddings by declaring their wishes in writing. When the European war broke out, many grooms who were preparing to get married were conscripted into the army. Hitler adopted this new plan of long-distance weddings to solve their difficulties. The marriage registry first sends the marriage certificate to the front line, and after the groom signs it, the bride is notified to go to the marriage registry with a witness to perform the legal ceremony. Then, the groom at the front line and the bride in the rear officially become husband and wife. A steel helmet is placed on the desk in the registry as a symbol of wartime. Newly married soldiers can also ask for leave to meet with their wives. (Haitong News Agency Airmail)

### The Puppet Government of Jiaxing Extorts and Exploits Wealthy Households and Shops. All Grain in the County is Plundered.

Jiaxing Correspondence: Since taking office, Magistrate Jin of Jiaxing has claimed that "expenses" are insufficient and has greatly increased tax rates to raise money on a large scale. He has also colluded with the "supervisors" sent by the Japanese to extort money from residents and shops under various pretexts. It is reported that among those recently extorted, the wealthy household Jiang Zuorong was accused of his younger brother Shou Rong being the leader of "bandits" (Shou Rong is not related to Zuorong). Jiang was arrested at Dianji Bay and only released after bribing them with 1,000 yuan. Gao, the father, was arrested on charges of communicating with "bandits," detained for two nights, and severely tortured. He was only released after bribing them with 600 yuan. Xu was also defrauded of 3,000 yuan for the crime of communicating with bandits. Chinese medicine practitioner Hang Zhixuan was also arrested for secretly smoking opium, fined 900 yuan, and forced to obtain a license. Da Shun Chang Oil Shop transported several baskets of edible oil from the warehouse to the shop for sale. The puppet government accused the shop of transporting and selling the goods without paying taxes and arrested the shop manager, who was only released after paying a fine of 5,000 yuan. A rice shop on Beida Street was asked by a customer to send five piculs of rice to outside the North Gate. On the way, it was intercepted by Japanese and puppet secret agents who accused them of "supplying the enemy with grain" and detained both the people and the goods. They were only released after paying 1,200 yuan, and the rice was confiscated. Shangyou Soy Sauce Garden was fined 3,000 yuan for trafficking in smuggled salt. A photo studio on Haier Bridge was fined 800 yuan for secretly taking military photos.

Rice in this area has been bought up by the Japanese. Recently, they have forcibly investigated the rice stored by residents, and those with more storage are confiscated on charges of hoarding. The confiscated rice is sent to the Japanese special service agencies and transported to Shanghai. Therefore, there is almost no grain stored in this county, and the residents are very panicked, anticipating that serious problems will inevitably occur soon.

### Japanese Troops in Kunshan are Stationed Along the Railway Line. Villages are Intolerably Disturbed. Japanese and Puppet Troops Forcibly Collect Rice.

Kunshan Correspondence: Recently, the Japanese have transferred a large number of guards to station in villages along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line to prevent guerrillas from demolishing the tracks. Last month, at Dayang Bridge in Xiaju County (under the jurisdiction of the First District), more than 20 Japanese guards occupied civilian houses. Under the pretext of searching for guerrillas, these guards broke into civilian homes, forcibly robbed food, and teased women. They even grabbed farmers, either five or six in a group, or seven or eight in a group, drove them into the river, and ordered them to swim. In this time of piercing spring cold, those who entered the water could not bear the cold. It is said that more than ten people have frozen to death on the spot, and those who were fortunate enough not to freeze to death were mostly shivering and dehumanized. They also arrested women and subjected them to atrocities.

The puppet organization, following the Japanese instructions, used the pretext of collecting military rice to search for and purchase rice from the people, transport it to Shanghai for sale, and make huge profits. It is said that the quota for this county is 6,000 piculs, collected in six installments, with a limited price of 17 yuan per picul. However, due to the layers of skimming by intermediaries, the farmers actually received only 12 or 13 yuan. Although only two collections have been made so far, the people's reserves are empty. Some township chiefs have requested a reduction in the quota due to their inability to meet the demand, but they are threatened with house-to-house searches, and if any hidden rice is found, it will be confiscated. When villagers sell rice, it is often intercepted en route to be used as military rice, so they dare not sell rice, and the rice market has virtually stagnated.

### Paramount Athletic Association: Today's Celebration Tea Dance to Celebrate Winning the Western Youth Basketball Championship at Paramount Dance Hall from 5 PM

The Paramount Athletic Association basketball team, since its establishment, has only two short years of history. The association was founded in the autumn of the year before last, transformed from the Qianghua Athletic Association. At its first attempt, it repeatedly defeated strong opponents, winning the private Shanghai High School Cup Group A and B championships, and the Zhong Qing Group A championship. At the same time, its volleyball team also won the Hongyi Cup championship. However, in the Western Youth League for many years, due to a final setback, it was ranked below Mai Hong, and the Western Youth Basketball Championship did not come to fruition. This was the first year of battle for the Paramount. Last year, Cai Yanxiong, Zhou Dayun, and others went to Yunnan one after another. Feeling that their strength was inferior, they gave up participating. Subsequently, with the successive withdrawals of Daxing and Lanmo, prompted by Ran Sanjiao, the host of the Western Youth League, they used the old name of Qianghua to replace Tianxing in the competition. Even with the departure of Zhou and Cai, their sharpness was not diminished. From the beginning, they defeated Guan, and then, Mai Bai, defeated Little Bear, and all the Western Youth heroes bowed their heads. The Western Youth title, which the Chinese team had not touched for ten years, was finally captured by the Paramount. The team's brilliant performance in the ball (see picture) was only surpassed by Shanghai University in the second year. For eleven years, the title had been in the hands of foreign teams. In those years, Chinese teams that were revered like saints, such as St. John's, Jinan, and Zhenru, all failed due to a final slip-up and had regretted it for many years. Now, the Paramount has established this miraculous achievement, not only washing away the regret of the Chinese team's long absence from the championship, but also winning supreme glory for Chinese basketball. The association, in view of the achievements, has decided to hold a grand tea dance at the Paramount Dance Hall at 5 PM this afternoon, inviting guests from all walks of life to give awards at that time. Mr. Yu Qiaqing will present a commemorative cup. The ceremony is simple and solemn. The gifts to be distributed this time number in the thousands. Honorary chairmen of the association are Du Tingrong, Zhang, Xing Zai, Chairman, Li, Ding Xiongzhao. The guests are invited.

### On Estate Tax

— Wang Wennan

As the saying goes: "Wealth is the mother of all government." All government constructions depend on abundant financial resources for utilization. Whether financial resources are sufficient depends on the quality of the tax system. Therefore, countries are doing their utmost to improve their tax systems and enrich their national treasury revenue. China's tax system has always adopted indirect taxes as the central tax system. The burden on the people is not equal, and the country's financial management has little room for adjustment. Before the war, the national tax revenue mainly came from the three items of indirect taxes: customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax, which accounted for 80% of the total tax amount each year. However, since the government's war of resistance against Japan, most of the three major tax revenues of customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax have been temporarily lost to the hands of the Japanese puppets and have decreased. However, the expenditure on all government expenses and national defense is huge, so taking this opportunity to reform the tax system and open up new taxes is not only to seek remedy, but also to adjust the tax burden of the people. In addition to the income tax and excessive profits tax that have been levied successively, the preparation for estate tax was started by promulgating the Interim Regulations on Estate Tax on October 6th of the year before last, and the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Estate Tax were promulgated on December 30th last year. It can be seen that the preparation has reached maturity and the implementation is imminent. The estate tax and the income tax and excessive profits tax that have been implemented are both direct taxes. Therefore, China's direct tax system has been largely completed, which is no less than a highlight in China's financial history. We should all follow this good tax, actively pay it, and fulfill our duties as citizens. Here, I would like to express my humble opinion on the content of the Estate Tax Regulations, and I hope that contemporary scholars at home and abroad will correct me:

(1) Taxable object Article 12 of the Interim Regulations on Estate Tax stipulates that taxes shall be levied on all estates with a total value of more than 5,000 yuan. The collection methods of estate tax in various countries are not the same. For example, the United Kingdom levies inheritance tax (tax on the part inherited by the heir) in addition to estate tax. Other countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan only levy inheritance tax, while the United States only levies estate tax. It is necessary to transfer in accordance with the private property situation and financial policy of each country. China's estate tax is still in its initial stage, so it is appropriate to only levy tax on the total amount of the estate. Estate tax does not distinguish between degrees of kinship, is easy to calculate, and is easy to implement, unlike the complexity of calculating inheritance tax.

(2) Scope of taxation The scope of taxation of estate tax in various countries is also different. Some adopt the principle of domicile and the principle of economic affiliation, such as the United Kingdom. Those who have a domicile in the United Kingdom are taxed on their total property and movable property abroad. Those who do not have a domicile in the United Kingdom at the time of death are only taxed on their total estate in the country. Foreign estates are exempt from tax. The United States places equal emphasis on nationality and domicile. Article 1 of the Interim Regulations on Estate Tax in China stipulates that taxes shall be levied on all property left in China at the time of death. Chinese people who have a domicile in China and have estates abroad shall also be taxed. The scope of taxation adopts the principle of domicile and the principle of economic affiliation, which seems to be similar to what the United Kingdom does.

(3) Tax rate The Estate Tax Regulations stipulate that the starting point for taxation is 5,000 yuan. All estates with a total value from 5,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan shall be subject to a tax of %. For estates with a total value exceeding 50,000 yuan, the tax rate adopts a progressive excess system. From exceeding 50,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, 1% shall be levied on the excess amount. Up to exceeding 10 million yuan, 50% shall be levied on the excess amount as the highest degree, with a total of sixteen levels in between. The tax rate of the British estate tax ranges from 1% on estates exceeding 100 pounds to 500 pounds, to 50% on estates exceeding 2 million pounds, with a total of 33 levels in between. Compared with China's tax rate, which is only divided into sixteen levels, the progression seems to be much slower.

(4) Valuation of the estate The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Estate Tax stipulate that the collection agencies in various places shall set up an Estate Evaluation Committee, consisting of five to seven members. In addition to a representative of the collection agency who is a member by default, the Ministry of Finance shall appoint the following candidates in the local area: (1) one representative designated by the judicial organ, (2) one representative designated by the land administration or civil affairs organ, (3) one representative designated by the education or cultural organ, (4) one representative designated by the local autonomous organ or group, (5) one representative designated by the local financial organ, (6) one local impartial person. It is also stipulated that evaluation committee members should avoid participating in the period when the person or the person's spouse is a blood relative within five degrees of kinship or a relative by marriage within three degrees of kinship to the estate owner. They shall not participate in the evaluation of the inherited estate. The organization of the evaluation committee is relatively strict. The participating members are representatives of various local agencies and local impartial people. The evaluation of the estate should be handled fairly and there should be no suspicion of favoritism. Moreover, the regulations on the evaluation standards of various properties in the Detailed Rules for Implementation are also comprehensive. The people have something to follow, and the estate tax collection agencies will not arbitrarily estimate.

In short, the levying of estate tax not only helps to make up for the shortage of extraordinary finances, but also gradually enters a complete stage in China's direct tax system, and has a model of mutual phase. It is worth celebrating.

### Standard for Assessing the Value of Land Use Rights in Estate Tax

— Yu

Regarding the assessment of the value of land use rights in the estate tax that is being prepared, for those with a set term and annual rent, the value shall be assessed according to the remaining period according to the following standards:

Remaining Period | Value Assessed Based on Land Rent

5 years or less | 1 year's land rent

10 years or less | 2 years' land rent

30 years or less | 3 years' land rent

50 years or less | 5 years' land rent

100 years or less | 7 years' land rent

100 years or more | 10 years' land rent

For land use rights without a set term limit, the value shall be calculated at seven years' land rent. However, if there are local customs, the remaining term shall be determined according to the customs for calculation.

### Dynamics of the British Wartime Economy

— Yu Bianlin

Since Britain declared war on Germany, the British domestic economy immediately entered a wartime state. The process of transitioning from a peacetime free economy to a wartime controlled economy was quite calm, which proves that it was well prepared in advance, unlike the temporary panic during the last World War. In the three months after the start of the war, all measures regarding the control of foreign exchange, trade control, price restriction, and production adjustment were carried out in an orderly manner. It enables the national strength to be put into the path of control and mobilization, and under the command of the country, it can fully exert the effect of victory.

I. The Course of Financial Management

When relations between Germany and Poland deteriorated, the pound exchange rate began to plummet, which led to a large movement of funds, which was a great threat to the pound exchange rate. Britain immediately implemented emergency measures. On August 15, the Bank of England raised the discount rate from 2% to 4%. It also informed the United States and France that the British Exchange Equalization Account would temporarily maintain the price of the pound and let it find its natural level. On September 3, after declaring war on Germany, it ordered the London Exchange Market to close for one day on the 4th, and on the 5th, the British Treasury implemented foreign exchange control, restricting buying and selling, and stipulating exchange rates, with the US dollar exchange rate being 4.02 yuan. At the same time, in order to prevent funds from escaping to gold, the British government implemented gold management, stipulating that gold was 168 shillings per ounce, which was an unprecedentedly high price. On the 6th, in order to block foreigners from depositing money in Britain, restrictions were placed on the withdrawal of funds by foreigners. On the same day, the Treasury Department and the Bank of England, in order to concentrate the government's foreign funds, transferred all of the Bank of England's gold reserves of 280 million pounds to the Exchange Equalization Account to maintain the pound price. As a result, although the pound price in the New York market once plunged to around 3.7 yuan, the legal price in the London market was not affected in the slightest. This proves that the British authorities' management was appropriate and the Exchange Equalization Account was abundant. Therefore, the pound price in the New York market gradually rose back, and the difference between it and the legal price in London was only a few cents. The pound price in the New York market is recorded on the right to show the changes in the pound price.

Financial control is not limited to foreign exchange and gold. There is also a need to control foreign securities and domestic and foreign investments. The British government, in view of this, promulgated the Regulations for Banning Foreign Securities on August 17 to prevent funds from escaping through investment overseas, and in order to meet future needs, it will further dispose of these foreign securities worth 10 million pounds. On September 3, the Regulations for Controlling Capital were promulgated. Domestic industries that are beneficial to the country can raise new capital with the permission of the Treasury Department. For those in autonomous territories, colonies, and abroad, they are generally restricted or prohibited.

The above measures are all based on national interests. It is right to maintain strength and avoid unnecessary sacrifices. However, there are also shortcomings, as follows: One. Britain is the leader of the pound sterling bloc. In addition to the autonomous territories and colonies, those who have joined the pound sterling group include Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Japan, and China. Because of the convenience of trade clearing, there are many participants. The pound sterling group has become the largest and most powerful economic group in the world. Now, in order to safeguard its own interests, Britain should manage the exchange rate, block foreigners from depositing pounds in Britain, and the pound price has fallen by 15% compared with before the war. As a result, participants feel unfavorable and withdraw one after another, or link to the US dollar, such as Japan, or establish their own exchange rate standards, such as the Nordic countries. This cannot but be said to be a major loss for Britain. Two. Since Britain implemented the lockdown of foreigners' pounds deposited in Britain, foreigners cannot freely sell pounds in the open market, so a black market for foreign exchange is generated, and the black price of the pound and the legal price have a difference. Although this is not enough to affect the maintenance of the legal price of the pound, it is also a source of financial disruption.

II. Overview of Price Increases

The lesson learned from the last World War, and what the general public is eager to solve, is to avoid price increases during the war and to raise the standard of living. When the war first started, prices rose, so there were suggestions for "excessive profits" and "price law." Although there were measures to control prices, prices still rose. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following: One. When the war first started, influenced by the public's psychology, it was believed that the price increases during the last World War would be repeated today, so prices soared. For example, the price of the United States (with December 31, 1931 as the base 100) was 141 at the end of August, and suddenly increased to 168 in early September, and further increased to 173 in late September. This was entirely due to speculation. Although it has fallen slightly since then, it is still above the pre-war price, and much higher. The same is true in Japan and China. This is because the world's price increases affect British prices. Two. The pound price has fallen by 15% compared with before the war, so imported goods are all more expensive than before. Three. Shipping costs are high during the war, several times higher than before. Moreover, due to the danger of shipping, insurance premiums have also increased sharply, which all increase the production cost of goods. Four. Since Britain is in a state of war, all industries are military-oriented, and ordinary industries have reduced production due to a lack of raw materials, government control, and insufficient labor, resulting in an uneven supply. The rise in prices is an unavoidable phenomenon during the war, but excessive price increases are enough to affect people's lives. The government authorities should adopt strict controls to prevent the arrival of fear. The British wholesale price index is recorded on the left (1913-100)

1939 | 1938

July | 75.0 | 77.9

August | 75.0 | 76.2

September | 83.0 | 76.0

October | 90.0 | 75.8

November | 94.0 | 74.2

It can be seen from the above table that the price in November was more than a quarter higher than before the war. Such a rise in prices is enough to affect people's lives. As a result, the wages of more than 20 types of industries have been increased. There are no formal statistics on wage increases that can be cited. However, the following figures can be used as a reference for readers. Among miners, adult workers are paid 88 pence per shift, and young workers are paid 4 pence, which will increase wages by 5.5 million pounds per year. The spinning department in the textile industry increased its original wages by 12.64%, other manufacturing departments increased by 12.5%, male workers in the dyeing department were paid 2 shillings per week, workers were paid 1 shilling and 2 pence per week, and weavers were calculated according to the revised "extra work wage rate," which will increase wages by 1 million pounds per year. Other industries, such as electricity, are paid an additional 3 shillings and 6 pence per week. It can be seen that Britain's prices have entered a serious stage.

The goal of foreign trade is to promote exports and restrict imports in order to achieve a balance of international payments. This is the case in peacetime, and it is also the case in wartime. However, the methods used are different. In peacetime, exchange rate devaluation is implemented, prices are lowered, and goods are dumped overseas. However, in wartime, it is necessary to seek exchange rate stability and price stability, and then import food, raw materials, and weapons necessary for wartime as much as possible, restrict the import of secondary necessities, and prohibit the import of luxury goods. At the same time, in order to maintain overseas markets and obtain foreign exchange, efforts should be made to maintain exports. The British government, in view of this, is making every effort to adjust trade to respond to the wartime environment. On August 25, it promulgated the export ban system for military supplies and raw materials related to military supplies. On September 6, it resolutely banned the import of cotton and silk products.

On September 8, it implemented an economic blockade against Germany. Before long, German merchant ships disappeared at sea. As a result, all countries that used to trade with Germany felt inconvenienced. It also reduced trade with Germany in neutral countries bordering Germany. This can only be increased exports to supply the needs of various neutral countries, and as much as possible imports to purchase the surplus of various neutral countries. This is the only effective weapon of economic warfare.

Today, most countries implement trade control. For the import of military supplies, we can rely on autonomous territories, colonies, and the United States, so there is no need to worry. For exports, due to the strict control of various countries, the future is still difficult to be optimistic. If imports increase and exports do not increase, then even if Britain has huge gold reserves and foreign exchange, there is a danger of depletion. Then what? Then the only way is to take the German goods market and replace it. According to the past, Central and South America is the most important place for Germany's foreign trade, and Japan is the most promising place. Central and South America have abundant raw materials, such as wheat, wool, meat, and kerosene, which are urgently needed by Britain during the war, and Central and South America also needs huge amounts of industrial products. This is the only good market for British goods. Britain is now paying attention to this. Recently, it has been rumored that Britain will order 170,000 tons of beef and 30,000 tons of mutton from Argentina. Argentina has agreed to order locomotives and vehicles from Britain in exchange. In this way, Britain can save foreign exchange expenditures and also have a way out for goods, and can take the opportunity to restore its trade position with Central and South America. At this time of long-term war, economic competition, and the inability to borrow foreign debts, the British government is very careful about the use of funds and will never spend a penny lightly. Foreign trade is conducted in a way that is beneficial to Britain.

The issue of shipping has a great relationship with foreign trade. When the war first broke out, the ship losses in February accounted for 1.5% of its total merchant ships, so a convoy system was adopted, and ship losses were greatly reduced as a result. Moreover, based on the experience of the last World War, the shipping problem during the war is not the high cost of shipping, but the reduction in transportation capacity. Therefore, Britain recently established a Ministry of Transportation to concentrate ships to transport food and weapons. At the same time, warehouses and freight cars are added to the ports to facilitate the loading and unloading of goods. Cooperation between Britain and France is also adopted to maximize the transportation capacity of merchant ships.

When the war broke out, shipping was lost, which caused panic in Britain's food supply, and the supply of butter and salted meat from Denmark was temporarily cut off, which led to high food prices. A long-term plan of the Food Department was made to control the supply and distribution of major foods in order to avoid the disadvantages of excessive or insufficient supplies. The control methods are: First, to stipulate the highest prices for major foods; Second, to sign long-term contracts with overseas countries to obtain cheap supplies, such as ordering all of its sugar production from sugar producers in its empire. In short, efforts are made to distribute food equally so that people can get sufficient food.

The storage, prices, and purchases of raw materials such as iron, steel, lead, wool, wood, and leather are all controlled by the Supply Department. In fact, most of these controls are handled by the Chamber of Commerce. Contracts are signed with its territories for important raw materials, such as ordering the surplus exports of copper from Canada and ordering all of Australia's wool production. To date, there is no shortage of raw materials, so there is little control over non-essential consumption.

Today's Britain is focusing all its efforts on national defense, so many industries that were originally unrelated to military vehicles are now also turning to the manufacture of munitions, and the original vehicle needs industry is expanding rapidly. In the two months after the outbreak of the war, there were as many as 10,000 factories engaged in the manufacture of munitions. It can be seen that its wartime production is focused on military needs, and the production of other industries is certainly inferior to that before the war.

To sum up, Britain's wartime economic policy is very appropriate. In these few months, it has been able to fully implement it, so that Britain's wartime economic structure can be stabilized. If the war is prolonged, Britain will be superior to Germany.

### China's Estate Tax Rate

— Yu

China's tax system has always been centered on indirect taxes. Now, with the progress of the War of Resistance and national construction, it is gradually entering a direct tax system. The actual amount of income tax collected during the war has exceeded the budgeted amount. The excessive profits tax has been levied on New Year's Day this year, and the preparation for the estate tax has also been completed. The estate tax rate is extremely low and adopts a progressive exchange rate. It is the most advanced tax system in modern times. The tax rate is listed below. Total estate amount (unit: national currency 10,000 yuan)

### Floating Hoarded Goods Gradually Decreasing, Foreign Rice Returns Half a Yuan

After the rice market plummeted again before, the general original root merchants and peddlers, because the price disk fell through, due to their own capital relations, were unwilling to easily sell off, holding on without releasing. Floating scattered households repeatedly threw off, and the various goods in their hands were gradually reduced, with no intention of continuing to sell. Therefore, although the morning retail market was still not smooth, the chips on the market were not as abundant as the previous day, the shouts were firm, and the market turned to be hesitant. Until the middle market, there was no change. When the general customers saw that the general situation was stable, or there was a sign of turning, they took advantage of the low prices to purchase. Under the inquiries of each, the shouts of the customers rose, and the situation became tight. As a result, the various colors of foreign rice returned about half a yuan. If No. 1 Saigon opened at 44 yuan, 44 yuan, half a corner, No. 2 was 40 yuan and 5 corners, the market was 40 yuan, Chen was 41 yuan and a half, Huo Jiao Pagoda Brand was 40 yuan and a half, mixed grade was 43 yuan and 2, 3 corners, 43 yuan, small Jiao Gao was 40 yuan, the market was 39 yuan and a half, followed by 38 yuan and a half. Tokyo Yi Jian was 39 yuan and a half, 39 yuan, mixed broken was 35 yuan, 34 yuan, Gao was 35 yuan and a half. Although the glutinous rice sales market was not smooth, it was also tight by 3, 5 corners due to the rise in foreign rice. Liyang Bai Yuan was 40 yuan and 5 corners, Jin Shan Bai Yuan was 40 yuan and 2 corners, Danyang Bai Yuan was 30 yuan and a half yuan, Gao was 40 yuan, and more than 1,000 bags of thick and thin japonica rice and early and late rice were transferred from the Hongkou District yesterday. It is heard that the off-site black market is still normal, and the market price has not changed.

### Half a Yuan Increase for Sliced Green Sugar

Yesterday, the trend for foreign sugar was soft and flat. The public association quoted spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar at 24. The price for sugar from this store remained at 62.2 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar ranged from 0.6 to 0.3 yuan. B-mark West godown sugar was 65.9 yuan, and East godown sugar was 65.4 yuan. DY-mark West godown sugar was 63.5 yuan. H-mark old red sugar was 44 yuan. Dutch red WA-mark sugar increased by 0.1 yuan to 47 yuan. Domestic sugar remained strong. More than 40 containers of Xinghua sliced green sugar, of better quality, opened at 44.5 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan. Shimen sliced green sugar was quoted at 45 yuan, but no transactions occurred.

### Newly Built Mushrooms - High Costs

Domestic new shiitake mushrooms have already appeared in late winter and early spring, but there have been no transactions in this city. This is because cheap, inferior goods are being dumped, making it difficult for locally grown mushrooms to gain a foothold. Although a small number have arrived in Shanghai, they are immediately re-exported to Hong Kong because of the high exchange rate there, which makes it worthwhile. The cost is 550 yuan. As the supply increases daily, a steady source is expected. However, transportation is difficult and expenses are high, so it is predicted that future opening prices will not be cheap.

### Black Iron Billets - Abundant Market Supply - Nail Prices Recover Well

Due to large purchases by construction gangs and some demand from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao, the market for nails from this factory has been quite active in recent days. Confidence is also strong. The current market price for each barrel of Bessemer nails is 54 yuan, an increase of about 1 yuan compared to before. It is estimated that 600 to 700 barrels were sold on the market yesterday.

Transactions for black iron billets are led by the thermos factory on this street, followed by mirror factories, machine factories, and printing factories. External demand from places such as Tianjin, Yantai, etc. is also considerable. However, the current market supply is still abundant, so there is no risk of supply and demand imbalance for the time being. Prices are also stable, with each bundle of 2,000 pounds selling for 825 yuan and each box of 200 pounds selling for 80 yuan.

### Chen Guiyuan's Revival

After the opening decline, the market for Chen Guiyuan incense sticks from Miscellaneous Roads was quite weak. However, as prices became more favorable, buying sentiment gradually improved. Yesterday, the market showed some recovery, with asking prices rising by 1 to 2 yuan. It is also heard that production prices have risen, and the market is expected to tighten further.

### Statistics on the Total Amount of Bonds Issued by the Ministry of Finance

According to the "Survey of Chinese Bonds," compiled by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the total amount of bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance since the beginning of the Republic of China and the total amount repaid, along with the outstanding debt, are presented in a concise manner. The following is a reprint: (Unit: Thousands of Yuan)

### Speculation and Manipulation Raise Prices - Courts Adopt Severe Punishments - Handled According to Wartime Regulations - Maximum Sentence is Life Imprisonment - The Municipal Council Collects Evidence and Files Lawsuits with the Court at Any Time

Since the start of the war in this city, some wealthy households and unscrupulous merchants have taken advantage of the situation to speculate on and manipulate daily necessities and food, monopolizing the market and causing prices to soar, in some cases exceeding pre-war prices by more than tenfold. For example, the price of rice, a staple food, was only about 10 yuan before the war, but now it is almost 60 yuan, which has a profound and significant impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people. If it were not for the hoarding and manipulation by these people, although prices might be slightly higher than before, they would never be so endlessly high.

Previous Penalties Were Too Light

The Public Concession's Municipal Council had stipulated price limits for food, and those who sold above the limit would be subject to legal sanctions. However, ordinary criminal law had no explicit provisions sufficient to punish such people. Therefore, they were forced to adopt Article 33 of the Police Offenses Regulations, but the maximum penalty under that article was only 15 days of detention or a fine of 15 yuan, which was too light to serve as a warning.

Decision to Adopt Two Regulations

These people only know how to enrich themselves and do not care about the suffering of the poor, resulting in the so-called "under-the-table" prices in the market continuing to soar. The authorities' efforts were in vain. Now, in order to severely crack down on this, the Legal Department of the Municipal Council and the authorities of the Special No. 1 Court have jointly decided to adopt two separate regulations promulgated by the National Government: the "Measures for Assessing Prices and Suppressing Speculation and Manipulation in Wartime" and the "Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Wartime."

Offenders May Be Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

According to the penalty clauses in these two regulations, those who speculate and manipulate prices may be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for up to five years, and may also be fined one to three times the amount of their ill-gotten gains. Such severe penalties should serve as a warning to hoarders and make them realize the error of their ways.

Lawsuits Will Be Filed Immediately Upon Obtaining Evidence

The Municipal Council has now ordered its staff to investigate, and if anyone violates these two regulations, lawsuits will be filed immediately based on the evidence obtained, and they will be severely punished. Therefore, in the near future, a large number of hoarders will be subject to these severe penalties. Note that the aforementioned two separate regulations were published on page 7 of the second section of this newspaper on February 22nd (Thursday) and will not be reprinted here.

### The Silver and Money Industries Decide to Carefully Accept Pledges - The Purpose is to Prevent Speculation

The member firms and banks of the Shanghai Silver and Money Industries Association, recognizing that speculation is rampant in Shanghai and affects people's livelihoods, have decided to take measures to prevent it in order to curb prices and stabilize the market, such as raising interest rates and charging small storage fees. They have agreed to be extremely careful in accepting collateral.

Because Gold Bars, Yarn, Cotton Cloth, Hardware, Rice, and Coal are the most important items used as collateral and are also the main targets of market speculation. In the past, during the peak period of real estate speculation in Shanghai, the silver and money industries were most willing to accept them as collateral, which further fueled real estate speculation.

Currently, if the silver and money industries provide various facilities for pledging Gold Bars, Yarn, etc., it will undoubtedly fuel speculation and harm the market, which is not insignificant. At the same time, due to the surplus of funds in the Shanghai market and the lack of proper uses, they are making every effort to transfer the

Floating Capital Inward

To assist the government in completing the construction of the Southwest and Northwest regions. In addition, all member firms and banks of the Silver and Money Industries Association have decided not to participate in speculation and hoarding, or engage in so-called bill of exchange discounts.

### Large Numbers of Chinese Seamen Unemployed - Up to 7,000 in Germany - 5,000 Have Arrived in Shanghai

Since the outbreak of the European war, countless Chinese seamen in various European countries have lost their jobs. Several weeks ago, more than 5,000 arrived in Shanghai. According to reports from Germany, 7,317 Chinese in Germany have become unemployed, accounting for 90% of the total number of Chinese expatriates in Germany. It is learned that when the "Conde Russo" arrived in Shanghai, 800 people also arrived, and the Italian ship "Conde Verde," which arrived in Shanghai on the 24th of this month, also carried 500 people.

### Tomorrow is the Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Death - All Sectors Will Lower Flags to Half-Mast - Entertainment and Banquets Will Be Automatically Suspended for One Day - The Association for Integrity and Shame Encourages All Sectors to Support National Policies

Tomorrow is the 15th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. All sectors of this city will lower flags to half-mast in accordance with the arrangements agreed upon by the Taxpaying Chinese Association and the Concession authorities, and will automatically suspend entertainment and banquets and abstain from meat for one day to express their grief. All agencies, public organizations, and schools will be closed as usual. Due to the special circumstances, commemorative ceremonies will not be held except in schools. The authorities of the two Concessions will implement strict precautions to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble and disrupt public order in order to maintain security.

Key Points of Propaganda by the Association for Integrity and Shame

The Committee for the Promotion of Integrity and Shame Movement in this city issued a special notice on the 15th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death to the members of the Integrity and Shame Movement Practice Groups in all districts, calling for them to mobilize together to persuade citizens to prioritize the nation and the country, cultivate their moral character, promote integrity and shame, adhere to their posts, and strive for glory. Propaganda key points have been created: (1) Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to revolution, and his will was extremely strong. If we want to save China from danger, we must emulate Sun Yat-sen's spirit of perseverance and hard work. (2) Sun Yat-sen absolutely hated shameless traitors who were corrupt and perverted the law. Therefore, to commemorate Sun Yat-sen, we must first use the spirit of cultivating moral character and promoting integrity and shame to encourage ourselves and others. (3) Those who distort the Three Principles of the People are not only traitors to Sun Yat-sen but also sinners for all time. We must punish them like animals without any leniency. (4) We hope that everyone will build a strong fortress under the central national policy and the leadership of the President in order to win the final victory.

### Hankou and Jiujiang Unexpectedly Remit Japanese Military Scrip - The Post Office's Actions are Disappointing - Citizens Throughout the City Resolve Not to Accept It

Since the Shanghai Postal Administration allowed the purchase of stamps with Japanese currency or military scrip, public opinion has been in an uproar, and all sectors have refused to use it. For nearly two months, it has only been accepted when Japanese people purchase mail. Now, the deputy postal director of the Bureau, Kinshi Kinkichiro (Japanese nationality), has made a further request to implement military scrip remittances in various guerrilla areas. The director, Zha Peilin (French nationality), has approved the "Military Scrip Remittance" to be developed in Hankou and Jiujiang. There are detailed regulations on the surcharges to be collected and the number of silver dollars each person can remit each day. However, all sectors of the city are deeply dissatisfied with this measure by the Bureau and are expected to refuse it.

As for the bureaus under the Hankou Postal Administration, only ordinary remittances are allowed, including the Dawangmiao, Zhongshan Road, Lanling Road, Hanjing Street, Jiaokou, and Xinjie branches, as well as Wuchang, Hanyang, Daye, Konglong, Shihuirong, Anlu, Tingsiqiao, Yangloudong, Xiaogan, Songbu, Wuxue, Jinkou, Huayuan, Qijiawan, Changjiangbu, Cangzibu, Huanggang, Huangshigang, Huangpi, Yangxin, Echeng, Yunmeng, Gedian, Puji, Jiayu, Guangshui, Hengdian, Chenjiaji, Yingcheng, Hanchuan, and Caidian. In the above-mentioned bureaus, the limit is temporarily set at 20 yuan per person per day. As for high-value remittances, the limit is temporarily set at 5,000 yuan per piece in Laokou and Enshi. It is also learned that large parcels sent from Shanghai to various places along the Jinpu Railway south of Tongshan, as well as the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and the places it passes through, including Kaifeng and Shangqiu, have been temporarily suspended. However, parcels containing medicines are still being accepted as usual.

### The Rice Market Will Not Temporarily Close on Sundays - The Rice Market Has Not Yet Stabilized - Fear that Hoarders Will Take the Opportunity to Manipulate

The Shanghai Rice Industry Tea Party Market held its 65th meeting of the Market Management Committee at the Qinglian Pavilion Public Sample Office on Fuzhou Road yesterday at 11:30 a.m. Sixteen committee members attended, including Yang Shaoyuan, Cai Shengming, Hu Bokang, and Yan Jiyun. During the meeting, they discussed the following: 1. The authorities of the two Concessions ordered that the number of transactions and sales in this city market be reported daily for statistical purposes. It was resolved that the Association had repeatedly announced to the industry to fill in transaction orders and actual sales figures, and all members of the industry had complied in order to take care of the overall situation and prevent manipulation. In order to handle the matter strictly, the committee members will notify all members of the industry again that they must comply with the above-mentioned procedures for business. Otherwise, in addition to not being resolved in case of disputes, they will also be severely punished. 2. Closing on Sundays to facilitate the reorganization of business. It was resolved that although Sunday is the day for stacking goods, transactions in the market have not stopped. Since the rice market has not stabilized this month, it is feared that closing the market will give speculators the opportunity to manipulate it. However, if a majority of members of the industry believe that it is necessary to close the market on Sundays, the Association may convene a meeting to decide. 3. Closing on commemorative holidays. It was resolved to follow the dates stipulated by the Municipal Council.

### China is Fighting for the Whole World - Americans Believe It is True - And Further Express Opinions - Saying They are Fighting for the Western United States - Bakstetter Sends a Letter to Miller's Review to Express His Views

China's decision to resist the war is for the peace of the whole world. Regarding this point, Bakstetter, a famous jurist in Washington, recently sent a letter to Miller's Review and Newspaper (see Miller's Review Weekly, Maru-Maru Issue).

"General Chiang Kai-shek once said that 'China is fighting for the whole world.' Since the publication of this statement, various facts have fully proved its truth. I would like to further express my opinion as follows: China is fighting for the entire interests of the western United States. However, American merchants there are supplying Japan with iron, oil, etc., enabling the latter to engage in the slaughter of Chinese civilians, rape women, and expand towards the Pacific. Currently, the U.S. Congress has gradually realized the need to sever trade relations with Japan (unless Japanese troops withdraw from China). I am very pleased about this.

### British Consul George's Speech - Living in Shanghai is Not That Difficult - The Key is to Establish a Reasonable Life

According to foreign sources, the British Consul in Shanghai, George, attended the joint annual meeting of the Oxford University and Cambridge University Shanghai Alumni Association the other night. Before the dinner, the chairman of the association gave a brief report on the work of the past year and then elected the new officers. At the banquet, a guest gave a humorous speech, saying that "living in Shanghai is very difficult," and then introduced the brief history of the British Consul, expressing unanimous praise. In response, the British Consul said that living in Shanghai is not very difficult. The difficulty lies in how to establish a reasonable lifestyle for oneself. Finally, the British Consul discussed the difficulties of the British government's work in Shanghai and asked for cooperation from all parties.

### A Male Corpse Found Hanged in the Western Section of Tushanwan

The other day in the early morning, an unnamed man, about 30 years old and resembling a worker, was found hanged on a tree in the cemetery of the Li family at No. 1111 Yude Road, west of Tushanwan, Xujiahui, Shanghai. At 8:00 a.m., a villager, Mao Xiyao, discovered the body and reported it to the Xujiahui French Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The deceased had already died and his body was cold. Judging from his appearance, he committed suicide due to being overwhelmed by the pressure of life. The body was untied and transported to the Tongren Funeral Home for autopsy. The prosecutor of the Second Branch Court was notified to assist in the autopsy. Because no relatives of the deceased could be found, the official instructed that the body be handed over to the Charity Hall for burial and wait for relatives to claim it.

### Ningbo Navigation Management Office Approves - Two Ships to Sail Directly to Ningbo - Registration of Direct Shipping Tugboats Has Been Extended - Bodies Continuously Recovered from the Jingsheng

After the Ningbo tugboat Jingsheng sank, divers hired from Shanghai began salvaging bodies from the ship on the 8th. According to a telegram from Ningbo received by this port the night before last, 25 bodies have been recovered in the past two days, six of which were recovered on the 8th, and the remaining 19 were recovered the day before. The names of the deceased have been partially identified by the Post-Disaster Committee and notified to the respective families for identification. Due to the tides, salvage work can only be carried out from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., and 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. each day, so the time is quite short. In order to expedite the salvage work, the Post-Disaster Committee telegraphed Zhu Meixian of the Shanghai Moufu Shipping Department again on the evening of the 9th to hire two or three more divers to go to Ningbo to assist in the work. Zhu contacted them after receiving the telegram yesterday, and they will depart for Ningbo by ship today or tomorrow.

Reasons for Extending the Tugboat Registration. The Ningbo Navigation Management Office originally set the deadline for temporary registration of tugboats sailing directly to Shanghai and Ningbo at the end of February, but then extended the deadline to the 15th of this month. However, it is claimed that the reason for the extension was due to mediation, and some people are boasting of their contributions to Shanghai shipping merchants. Zhang, the director of the Navigation Management Office, stated the following regarding this matter: This office approved tugboats to sail to Shanghai and Ningbo in order to alleviate the congestion of local goods. The revised measures of the Defense Department originally stipulated that registration would be stopped on March 15th. However, in order to prevent a surge in registration and an excess of ships over goods, which would inevitably hinder the regular shipping business and have a negative impact, the registration date was brought forward to the end of February. Unexpectedly, the European war became tense, and some foreign merchant ships were waiting for orders to concentrate, or the conditions were strange, and shipping merchants found it difficult to rent them. As a result, registrations with this office were few and far between, and there was still no hope of circulating stockpiled goods. Therefore, in accordance with the registration deadline revised by the Defense Department, the registration was extended to the 15th of this month. This is purely a matter of this office weighing the needs and coordinating shipping, without the need for mediation. Moreover, this registration is conducted openly, and anyone can apply. Those who want to operate a tugboat direct shipping business also do not need to ask someone to mediate. However, there are unscrupulous people who are using this to flaunt their power and seek improper gains, which is deplorable. It is hoped that the message will be conveyed to shipping merchants operating tugboats that if they encounter such unscrupulous people who are swindling, they can secretly report to this office and the Defense Command for investigation. The names of the informants will be kept confidential.

It is learned that the Italian merchant ship Changde Express and the Baoling Express, managed by the Huatai Steamship Company, have been approved by the Ningbo Navigation Office to sail directly from Shanghai to Ningbo. Both ships are scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 4:00 p.m. today.

Request to Allow Shanghai-Wenzhou Ships to Carry Passengers. Since Shanghai-Wenzhou routes have been frequently obstructed by Japanese warships outside the port of Wenzhou, although the ships are still sailing as usual, the shipping companies are unwilling to carry as many passengers as possible to avoid trouble for passengers en route. As a result, most passengers still have to travel to Ningbo to reach Wenzhou. It is learned that the Wenzhou natives in Shanghai, in view of the recent tragedy of the Jingsheng tugboat in Ningbo, which was caused by the transfer of goods on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, and the fact that Ningbo has become an important transportation hub in eastern Zhejiang, with a large number of passengers entering and leaving, and although the authorities have strict management, accidents are inevitable, now that Shanghai and Wenzhou are connected by sea, Wenzhou passengers can take the Shanghai-Wenzhou ships directly, which is more convenient and safer. However, passengers are often turned away because the ships refuse to carry them. Now, with the tragedy of the Jingsheng as a warning, the Shanghai-Wenzhou route should be actively opened to passengers. The fellow villagers have contacted the shipping companies separately and also sent a letter to the Wenzhou Natives Association in Shanghai yesterday, asking them to find a way to solve the problem on their behalf and submit it to the authorities for mediation and handling.

### French Troops Tighten Border Area Security - Continuing to Open Iron Gates is Not Allowed

The French defense forces stationed in the French Concession are now tightening security in the southwestern border area, paying particular attention to the iron gates along Tushanwan, Xujiahui, East and West Fahuazhen, and the Nanshi area. The details are as follows: French troops tighten border area security. Although the number of French-Vietnamese mixed defense vehicles stationed in the French Concession in Shanghai is not large, it is sufficient for all necessary arrangements in the Concession when necessary. It is reported that the French troops stationed in areas such as Lakner Road, Fuli Road, Sapo Road, French Avenue, and the Bund are concerned that the opening of many iron gates in the border area of the Concession has a significant impact on security within the Concession. In order to prevent criminals from mixing in, the number of original defense forces stationed at the Xiqiao, Nanyangqiao, Xinqiao Street, Zilaihuo Street, and Xinkaihe iron gates that have been opened in the Concession has been increased to three or four, and the curfew and patrol work are being carried out more seriously in order to eliminate the activities of bandits. Multiple iron gates are not allowed to be opened by the French. In addition to assigning Chinese, Vietnamese, and Russian police and French-Vietnamese troops to carry out the task of maintaining security throughout the area in the Xujiahui, Tushanwan, and East and West Fahuazhen borders in the western district and the entire area, the French Concession authorities are also paying close attention to pedestrians entering the Concession in the western and southern districts. The Japanese and puppet regimes in Nanshi are actively attempting to open more than 20 large and small iron gates in Tangjiawan and Avenue Joffre, but so far, the French authorities have not approved it. The only iron gates being considered for opening are the Xinbeimen and Laobeimen.

### Long-Term Public Bonds - Discounted Payment - Starting from March 31st - Remittance of Tomb Fees Will Be Divided into Six Installments

In order to reorganize the suspended banknotes of the Zhong, Zhong, and Jiao banks in Hankou, the Ministry of Finance issued 45 million yuan of long-term public bonds in the Republic of China year 17. The principal and interest of the bonds were designated to be paid from the surplus of customs duties. After the customs duties in the occupied areas were intercepted, the principal and interest of the bonds were forced to be suspended. In order to maintain credit, the National Debt Fund Management Committee agreed with the Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong banks that the four banks would discount the payments. The 13th installment of principal repayment of 1.25 million yuan and interest payment of 393,750 yuan will be paid by the Zhong, Zhong, and Jiao banks on March 31st in accordance with the regulations. A reporter from Xin Sheng News learned from the National Debt Fund Management Committee and the Central Bank yesterday that the principal and interest of the 13th installment of the Gold Long-Term Public Bonds will be discounted and paid on schedule by the four banks. However, in Shanghai, the payment will be divided into six installments (one month per installment) and paid by means of bank drafts. Holders of matured interest coupons and winning numbers can apply for current discount at the Shanghai branches of the Zhong, Zhong, and Jiao banks, and the three banks will issue "discount vouchers" for installment payments.

### Merchant Ships Weave Within the Japanese Blockade Line - Carrying Goods at Great Risk - Japanese Restrictions are Almost Ineffective

The Mainland Daily reported yesterday (9th) that a major shipping merchant said that small wheels and boats flying foreign flags dared to pass through the blockade imposed by the Japanese army on the coast and sail regularly to ports that had been considered "dead" for a long time due to Japanese restrictions, carrying goods from the Chinese interior to Shanghai to store on the Bund. The value of goods shipped to Shanghai each week is tens of thousands of yuan. These ships not only transport many valuable goods to Shanghai and other distribution points but also transport important products back to the interior. Much of this trade is based on barter. Many ports along the Chinese coast are covered with water mines or other dangers, so ships are always afraid of being a few miles offshore. On dark nights, dozens of sampans quietly set sail from the sea rocks and approached the ships anchored offshore, loaded goods, and sailed back to the coast. This may take several nights to complete. The loaders' sampans cannot travel during the day or on moonlit nights, as they are at risk of being attacked by Japanese aircraft. After the goods are unloaded, they are transferred from the secret storage places on the shore to the ship in sampans, stacked in the cabins, and set sail for Shanghai and other ports. Sometimes, sampans have no chance to approach the ship, so it is agreed that the goods will be left on certain islands or ports where the sampans can gather safely, and then transported back to the shore and transferred to the interior. This kind of cargo transportation business is very prosperous. The ships that come and go must have a large amount of cargo to transport and make a lot of profit. Even if the Nanning Highway or other entry points to free China are cut off, methods can always be found to maintain the necessary trade relations with the interior under any circumstances. The trade carried out in this way cannot be said to be insignificant; it is quite important. The captains of the ships returning to Shanghai have many thrilling encounters in their cargo transportation.

### Municipal Council Prison Report

Last year, the Municipal Council Prison employed 55 staff members who were locally recruited, including 29 Chinese, 11 Westerners, and 15 Indians. Their service performance was generally good, and the health of all staff was satisfactory. Discipline was also good. The total number of inmates (including Westerners and juveniles in the reformatory) was 6,562 on January 1st, increasing to 8,420 by the end of the year. The highest number reached 8,517, breaking all previous records. The reason for the increase in inmates was due to the deteriorating situation in the city and its suburbs. The types of crimes committed by inmates, except for opium cases, which remained similar to the previous year, all increased. Armed robbery cases were the most numerous.

Chinese Inmates Section: On January 1st last year, there were 6,312 Chinese inmates, with the number gradually increasing. By December 18th, it had reached 8,223, the highest number ever recorded. A total of 14,399 inmates were admitted throughout the year, and 12,212 were released. A total of 19 inmates were released in accordance with the National Government's amnesty law. Combining with previous years, a total of 3,024 inmates have been released, of which 1,320 were re-arrested and punished. The parole regulations continued to be implemented. A total of 1,109 inmates were reviewed by the prison authorities to determine whether they were eligible for parole. As a result, only 36 were actually released. Another 74 remained in prison because they could not find suitable guarantors. Including those specially released in previous years, a total of 578 inmates have been paroled, of which 97 were re-arrested, 4 died, and 14 were re-imprisoned for committing crimes. The effective period of the inmate work release regulations was extended to the end of December. A total of 380 inmates were reviewed in accordance with the above regulations, and 138 were released. Another 60 were not released because they could not find suitable guarantors or employment. Since the promulgation of the above regulations, a total of 254 inmates have been released on bail to work, of which 10 have been re-arrested and punished. The total number of inmate deaths throughout the year was 258, a decrease of 69 compared to the previous year. Among them, 70 already had incurable serious illnesses before entering prison. A total of 223 died from lung disease, enteritis, and peritonitis.

Juvenile Reformatory: At the beginning of the year, there were 127 juvenile inmates in the reformatory, increasing to 172 by the end of the year. A total of 248 juvenile inmates were admitted throughout the year, and 198 were released. The educational work of the juvenile inmates continued throughout the year, with monthly exams held and small bonuses given to those with the best performance as an encouragement. In addition, vocational training for children, such as sewing and carpentry, was also carried out as usual. The library has been renovated, but due to the sharp increase in the total number of inmates, it is necessary to expand it this year and purchase new books. The health of all juvenile inmates is excellent.

Western Inmates Section: At the beginning of the year, there were 121 male and 1 female Western inmates. At the end of the year, there were 120 male and 9 female. The health and behavior of the inmates were generally good. Three inmates died, all of whom were well treated before their deaths. One died because he refused surgery, otherwise he could have been saved. Two inmates were released for work.

Inmate Labor Section: Last year, the inmate labor section was extremely busy, in addition to meeting the needs of the prison, the police department, the Municipal Council, and the outside world, it also undertook miscellaneous work for the Public Works Department, with good results. The printing section was the best. There is an old printing machine that is unusable, so it is planned to purchase a new machine this year. At the end of the year, there were a total of 367 Chinese, 81 foreign, and 175 Indian prison staff members.

### Overseas Chinese Assist in Selling National Products to the South Seas; Establish Stores in Cities and Towns; Factories Should Pay Attention to Standards

The South Seas territories, including the Malay Peninsula, the Philippine Islands, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, Siam, and Burma, cover an area of more than 3.8 million square kilometers and have a population of 110.57 million, of which overseas Chinese account for 8 million. The political power belongs to England, Holland, France, and the United States, but Siam is an independent country. The main products are coffee, tea, rice, cocoa, coconut, and minerals. Singapore is the center of trade, because it is the most convenient for transportation. There are British, Italian, German, French, and Java shipping lines for maritime transportation from Shanghai to the South Seas. It takes ten days to reach Singapore by mail ship from Shanghai. There are air routes connecting from Hong Kong. The commercial operations in the South Seas are almost entirely run by overseas Chinese. Whether in cities or remote villages, there are Chinese stores. In fact, the South Seas commerce is mostly controlled by Chinese merchants. Taking Malaya alone, the total imports in 1937 were 69.2 million Singapore dollars, of which 27.6 million Singapore dollars were imported from China. This amount of imports was imported by a small number of merchants dealing in national products. Most of the others deal in European and American goods. Therefore, with the commercial advantage of overseas Chinese, it is extremely possible to promote the sales of national products to the South Seas. If domestic factories improve and adjust their products, and promote them in the South Seas, then the products of Shanghai factories can occupy an important position in Singapore and other places. The commercial conditions are nothing more than: (1) Quality must pay attention to the South Seas climate, and especially pay attention to standards. Cutting corners is a dead end. (2) The delivery date should be accurate. (3) The packing method should be precise. (4) Prices should be especially preferential to attract customers. Only then will it be effective.

### Anti-Chinese Movement in Siam Gradually Decreasing; What Mr. Mabatt Spoke About in Shanghai; Foreign Commerce Also Improving

Renmu Bao reported that Mr. Mabatt, a Westerner, and his wife came to Shanghai from Thailand (formerly Siam). On Friday, they arrived here on the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso. He said that although there are still anti-Chinese actions in Thailand, they have been decreasing. The main reason why Chinese are not tolerated in Thailand is that most of the rice production in the country is owned or managed by Chinese, and Thailand relies on rice exports to survive. There is excessive patriotism in Thailand now, with the slogan "Thailand is for Thais." Since the slogan has been implemented in the country's economic life, foreign commerce has plummeted. In recent months, the situation has improved slightly, but foreign commerce is still quite sluggish. Mrs. Mabatt added that she was eager to experience life in Shanghai. She has no nightlife to speak of in Bangkok. Her husband came here for business this time, but hopes to take the opportunity to travel. According to reports, the Conte Rosso encountered fog when it did not depart from Hong Kong and anchored at sea for a whole day, so it arrived in Shanghai 12 hours late. It carried about 80 foreign passengers from Italy and other places to Shanghai, and 148 Jewish refugees.

### Refugee Hospital of the Association Celebrates Anniversary Yesterday

The Refugee General Hospital of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association on North Xizang Road in this city is responsible for rescuing refugees throughout the city. Therefore, it accepts as many sick refugees as possible who are applied for hospitalization by various charity organizations. For the sick and poor people who are guaranteed by various hometown associations, institutions, churches, and philanthropists from all walks of life in the city, it also provides appropriate relief depending on the urgency of their condition and whether they are truly destitute and helpless. Therefore, the benevolence is widely spread. Yesterday was the first anniversary of the establishment of the hospital. Director Yu Weijiang of the Association and President Shang Feng and others received guests from all walks of life to visit, and held an anniversary celebration. First, Director Yu delivered an opening speech, followed by Yuan Ludeng reporting on the general situation of the hospital in the 28th year of the Republic.

### Raw Material Freight for Coal Briquettes Not Reduced; Coal Briquette Factory Stops Work; Requests the Chamber of Commerce to Send a Letter to Mr. Yu Qiaqing to Consult with Related Companies to Lower the Price

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce recently received a letter from the Coal Briquette Industry Association, stating that the soaring water freight is related to the cost of coal briquettes. Mr. Yu Qiaqing had previously agreed to find a way to reduce it, but there has been no definite solution so far. Please urge him to do so. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in view of the facts stated by the association, which are still true and quite urgent, immediately sent a letter to Mr. Yu, stating that the industry's hope to reduce freight, lower costs, and sell coal briquettes at a flat price can continue to proceed, which is a pressing need at present. It is hoped that you will preside over this matter with all your strength and consult with relevant companies to handle it, so that it can be realized as soon as possible. It is extremely important. Because the price of raw materials is too high, the Wufu, Dalu, and Huayang factories have stopped shipping goods. Although some factories have some remaining scraps, they only make a small amount of coal briquettes to cope with the market. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Coal Briquette Industry Association yesterday that the production volume of each factory in the past half month is as follows: Yitaixing 4,498.640 tons, Nanyang First Factory 1,659.500 tons, Nanyang Second Factory 2,601.625 tons, Guohua 2,259.500 tons, Dongfang 1,459.250 tons, Jinghua 805.325 tons, Guanghua 984.525 tons, Yuedong 465.500 tons, Yuanhua 198 tons, Beiyang 175.162 tons, Hu Licheng 17 tons, Huacheng Cuiji 221 tons, Nanhua 19.500 tons, Heji 53.760 tons, Nanfang Changji 230.203 tons, Gongyong 122.750 tons, Gongping 21.550 tons, Yanyan 28.900 tons, Xin Ping Anji 18 tons, totaling 15,992.690 tons. The average daily output of each factory is 1,066 tons, and more than a dozen non-member factories produce 100 tons per day.

### Orphanage and Women's Education Center Closed Down

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association, in order to help general orphaned and impoverished women and children, established the Shanghai Orphanage and Women's Education Center on Xiaoshadu Road, Robert Sheng Road last autumn. The director was Zhang Yichen, and the general manager was Liu Zhongying. The center accommodated more than 100 orphans and poor women, and set up sewing and other departments to provide the accommodated women and children with education in production technology. The center's food and clothing were provided by the Refugee Relief Association, and other expenses were raised by the center from outside to maintain it until now, which has been half a year. However, Zhang Yichen was recently wanted by the National Government, and Liu Zhongying was assassinated and killed last week. As a result, no one was in charge of the center, and it was in financial difficulty. Therefore, it was closed down on the 8th of this month. More than 30 women and children were accommodated and given money to return to their hometowns. More than 70 people were temporarily left at the waiting station of the Refugee Relief Association, waiting to be distributed to various shelters.

### Student Steals Books; Sentenced to 20 Days of Detention

Sun Yukun, a 17-year-old from Danyang, who claims to be a student at Kaiming Middle School, residing at No. 6 Xiangxing Lane, Ai'erjin Road, stole four large volumes of books on economics and political science, worth more than 30 yuan, from the Commercial Press at No. 221 Henan Road on the afternoon of the 8th of this month, taking advantage of the staff's unpreparedness. He attempted to escape but failed. He was discovered by Shen Guilin, a private inspector of the bookstore, and handed over to the police station along with the evidence. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court and prosecuted for theft. Judge Sheng of the Criminal Division Four heard the case. The defendant admitted that he could not afford to buy books, but loved the books he stole, so he committed the theft. After verifying the confession in court, Sun Yukun was sentenced to 20 days of detention for theft.

### Ping Pong Ball Factory on Daxilu Careless

The Universal Ping Pong Ball Factory at No. 3 to 4, Zhujia Shed, Daxilu, in western Shanghai, caught fire at 8:07 yesterday morning. The flames were raging and could not be approached. It also spread to the neighboring Wei Weaving Silk Factory and its two residential buildings. Although the fire brigade drove to the scene to put out the fire, the wind added to the flames, and it was not easy to extinguish them for a while. It was not extinguished until about two and a half hours later, resulting in heavy losses. More than a dozen houses were burned down.

### Impoverished Beggar Living Comfortably; Coveted by Companions; Nearly Robbed While Dying; Gatekeeper Righteously Follows and Uncovers the Case

An unknown male beggar in his sixties, who had always slept under the overpass of Baoxing Lane, No. 300, Fada Road, was quite comfortable in his life because he begged alone. Therefore, the clothes he wore were cleaner than those of ordinary beggars. Recently, he was seriously ill and unable to seek medical treatment. At 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, as he was about to die, Li Chenghua (30 years old, from Xuzhou), a fellow beggar, tried to strip off his clothes. Chen Caihe, the gatekeeper who saw the incident, stopped him. Li then carried the dying beggar to the sidewalk in front of Gezhi Public School at the intersection of Beihai Road and Guangxi Road in the British Concession and put him down, still trying to strip off his clothes. The gatekeeper Chen Caihe followed and saw Li stripping off the clothes. He immediately called the police, who arrested Li and brought him to the Laozha Police Station. The sick beggar was sent to Renji Hospital, but he died at 1:30 p.m. without being treated. The hospital informed the Laozha Police Station that the deceased was originally in the French Concession, so it notified the French Police Station. The French Police Station brought Li Chenghua, who was stripping off the clothes, back to the French Police Station. The corpse was sent to the Tongren Funeral Home for autopsy.

### Shanghai West Gambling Dens Reopen in Disguise; Change Facade Completely into Dance Halls

It was previously reported that the gambling dens in the western Shanghai area had all moved to the southern part of the city to continue operating. According to a reporter from Daguang News Agency, more than 20 gambling dens in the western Shanghai area, such as Hollywood, Yuyuan, and Guangsheng, have decided not to move to the southern part of the city. They are actively trying to get through to the "Entertainment Supervision Department" and uniformly change the names of the gambling dens to dance halls. The lower floors of the gambling dens will be decorated as dance halls and add dancing services. The upper floors will still set up gambling tables. This will not only cover up the scene to the outside world, but also use the dance halls to publish advertisements and attract business. It is reported that many of these gambling dens have already started the facade renovation project. As soon as the renovation is completed, they will be able to make a splash. The smaller gambling dens that cannot be transformed will not be closed down and plan to relocate and reopen. The gambling dens that have already opened and have not yet opened in the southern part of the city hold separate licenses and are not the gambling dens that have moved from western Shanghai.

Xu recently bought a large batch of firewood, but had no place to put it, so he piled it on the balcony on the second floor facing the road. However, the house was old and the balcony was made of wood, so it could not withstand the pressure. Suddenly, at around 11:00 a.m. yesterday, it collapsed with a loud crash, crushing Xia Chunjiang (55 years old) and Zhang Song (65 years old), both from Jiangbei, who were running a fruit stall under the balcony, injuring their heads and faces.

### Marital Knowledge: Love and Health Issues Before and After Marriage

Marriage is a major milestone in life. Who can escape this milestone? Having entered this milestone, who can eternally guarantee happiness? The reality is often this: many unmarried men and women walk the path of marriage full of happiness. However, after marriage, they bitterly curse "marriage is a tomb!" Is there something mysterious about this? I think every man and woman urgently needs to know about these kinds of knowledge and issues because these relate to their personal happiness so greatly.

Why do physiologically mature men and women fall in love, marry, and have children? Although there are many complex reasons for this, I think the main purpose is very clear in their hearts: it is for "that." Marriage is a union of sexual relations, which no one can deny. Therefore, we dare to say frankly: the love of unmarried men and women is based on sexual desire, and the love of married couples is based on sexual life. "Eating and sex are human nature." Human society has prospered based on these two major demands.

Sex is a manifestation of vitality. Physiologically and psychologically speaking, it is an impulse phenomenon generated by the nervous system acting on the endocrine glands of the reproductive system, or by the interaction of the endocrine glands of the reproductive system stimulating the nervous system. Therefore, it is often difficult for young people with weak will to restrain their sexual impulses. How dangerous this is! Because the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands (namely semen) is actually the source of life for young people, functioning to promote development, regulate metabolism, and nourish the brain, sex organs, spinal cord, and other parts of the nervous system. If a man can maintain chastity and self-love, and always keep the endocrine fluid of his reproductive glands abundant, then he will definitely develop strong and robust, with a handsome appearance, rich thoughts, and abundant energy... Such a healthy man is the most ideal partner for women before marriage. When seeking love, he will surely be able to get his way and choose the most satisfactory beauty. After marriage, their love will be even more intimate, their married life incomparably happy, and they will give birth to clever children and build a happy family. What a happy life! If a young man with a weak will commits masturbation, causes nocturnal emission, or marries early and indulges in promiscuity, damaging his sexual nerves or depleting the endocrine fluid of his reproductive glands, then symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency and infertility, and neurasthenia will arise in droves. Such a sick and weak man will inevitably be abandoned by women, hated by his wives and concubines, and may be in danger of falling into the most tragic situation of failed love and unhappiness before and after marriage! It is often seen in today's social news that wives, due to their husbands' incompetence and their own uncontrollable desires, have affairs or elope with others, or even boldly file for divorce from their husbands!

A man's health before and after marriage is the most important. In case of physical weakness and the above-mentioned symptoms, we advise him not to marry. At the very least, he must wait until he has carefully cured his condition. A husband who is already married must pay particular attention to the health of his sexual function. According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking preparations of strong animal gonadal hormones, such as "Germinal Essence," is most effective in improving sexual health and curing the above-mentioned symptoms. Because this agent is made from precious materials and its efficacy is certain, it is unmatched by any similar preparation. After taking "Germinal Essence," a man can produce sperm and nourish his kidneys within one day and night, promoting development. It is especially valuable to continue taking it quickly, as it will further nourish the nerves, regulate metabolism, and surely cure various symptoms in a short period of time, making energy doubled and love eternal. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people will prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take the special medicine "Hemitol Spermatostatic Tablets" (available in major Chinese and Western pharmacies such as Wuzhou) to stop the leakage of semen, which is especially effective.

### Health and Beauty: From the Thriving of All Things to the Importance of Breast Development

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Spring is indeed great and worthy of people's nostalgia and praise. It not only brings warm weather and mild sunshine, making people feel refreshed, but also presents a scene of prosperity in the natural world. Don't you see? The bean seedlings in the fields have sprouted vigorously under the warm sunshine, the wheat fields on the ridges are rippling gently in the breeze, the withered plants have sprouted new buds again, bearing flowers, the sunshine shines on the earth, showing a shimmering golden light, and the birds on the branches are singing happily, making pleasant noises. Spring is truly beautiful! It brings the active posture of all "life." But have we, who are called the spirit of all things, recovered health and happiness from weakness and withering? Have women who have lost their health and beauty, and who suffer from many diseases and pains, recovered their prosperity like flowers? Or, even though spring has come and flowers have bloomed, breasts remain shriveled, faces withered, and the morbid state remains, not only failing to live up to the spring scenery and losing the joy of life, but also sinking into a sea of ​​hatred, with no happy days ever. "Survival of the fittest" is the natural law of evolution. In today's society, where aesthetic concepts are very different from the past, women with shriveled breasts, thin buttocks, and a loss of health and beauty are inevitably rejected by society and fall into a tragic situation. Therefore, it is reasonable for intelligent and progressive women to regard health and beauty as their second life. As for the remedy for shriveled breasts and the loss of health and beauty, according to the experience of world-renowned gynecologist Candolin and others, including ourselves, simply taking the female "Germinal Essence," a reproductive gland ovarian endocrine preparation, can nourish the function of the ovaries, enhance metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop leucorrhea within one day and night. If you continue to take it, not only can it make the shriveled breasts bulge and increase health and beauty, but it can also darken the hair, beautify the face, and maintain youth.

### Untreated Nocturnal Emission Causes Endless Trouble

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

The body of a young man is like a tree in spring, thriving and growing in preparation for future flowering and fruiting. Therefore, farmers must be diligent in spring plowing and fertilization. If a young man wants to be strong, he should also nourish himself in the spring. In particular, masturbation and nocturnal emission must be avoided. Because the bad habit of masturbation is most likely to damage the sexual nerves, loosen the seminal gate, and cause nocturnal emission.

The semen in the body of a young man, the so-called endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands, including the pituitary gland, adrenal gland, and testicular gland, is a ductless gland that can directly penetrate into the blood, be irrigated throughout the body by blood circulation, and function to promote development, regulate metabolism, and nourish the brain, spinal cord, sexual organs, and other parts of the nervous system. If a person suffers from nocturnal emission and continues to delay treatment, symptoms such as brain decay and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney weakness and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging will arise one after another. Such a weak young man will not only fail to progress in his studies and have difficulty in completing his studies, with no hope for the future; he will even be abandoned by women and hated by his wives and concubines, and may be in danger of falling into the most tragic situation of failed love and unhappiness in life! Or, due to the exhaustion of sperm and energy, he may be prematurely old and short-lived, which is also countless!

Masturbation and nocturnal emission are truly the great enemies of a young man's body, so the bad habit of masturbation must be abandoned. Those who suffer from nocturnal emission should be thoroughly cured as soon as possible. The only effective method of treatment is to adopt a method that treats both the symptoms and the root cause. That is, on the one hand, take the world's most famous German brand of special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Hemitol Spermatostatic Tablets," to strengthen the seminal gate and stop leakage; on the other hand, take the gonadotropic tonic "Germinal Essence" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. Taking it continuously for a month will surely cure all kinds of symptoms and prevent nocturnal emission from recurring, and the body will surely become healthier, so the future is immeasurable! If patients can come to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment in person, a cure can be guaranteed.

### Excerpts from Old Newspapers, Sixty-Seven Years Ago (〇) (See this newspaper from the twelfth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty)

Small Coins Reappear

Since Magistrate Tan took office in Suzhou last summer and banned small coins, the people have found it quite convenient. Now that Magistrate Qian has taken office, although he has also issued proclamations prohibiting them, the unscrupulous money shop owners are watching and waiting, and their tricks have resurfaced. For every thousand coins, they mix in more than a hundred, and even the least is no less than thirty or forty. The money shops make a profit, but the people suffer greatly.

Women's Bathhouse

In the Yangzhou markets, some rent is paid monthly, and some is paid daily. The rent for a certain bathhouse in the old city is also paid on a daily basis, and the landlord and tenant are both good at calculating every detail. The other day, the tenant refused to exchange small coins, and the next day, when the bathhouse opened in the afternoon, the landlord sent a woman to sit 　. The landlord thought that the bathhouse would certainly exchange the small coins when they saw this situation, but the tenant thought that women would be ashamed to enter the bathhouse and ignored them. Each relied on their own position, so neither would give in. The woman was forced into a difficult situation and went straight into the bathing room. The bathers were greatly surprised to see her! Some left in a hurry before finishing their baths. One young man, intending to play a joke, deliberately approached naked, as if taking the bathhouse's side. The woman was furious and threw a teacup, hitting him on the head. The injury was minor, but he was exhausted! The crowd took the opportunity to drag the woman out, and most of the bathers also took the opportunity to escape. The dispute finally ended. To fight over a few small coins and almost cause a death is indeed taking it too seriously.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### War Period Epidemic Prevention: "Society as a Whole is Related" in Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Da

The saying "A major war is bound to bring a major epidemic" is heard, but people know the result without knowing the reason. I would like to use the experiences of the two previous European wars to explain this to the readers. Generally speaking, the duty of military doctors is to be busy providing aid at the front lines, while the benefit that private doctors bring to society is in the rear. Regarding epidemic prevention issues, they should conduct research diligently at any time and in any place, and pre-emptively form a unified joint defense front. In addition to several diseases such as typhoid fever, which can be prevented in advance by injection, the four matters of clothing, food, housing, and transportation should have separate and progressive obligations. Please allow me to give a few examples to illustrate the point.

First, clothing: The spread of scabies is due to the itch mites that parasitize clothing. Clothes should be washed frequently with boiling water and antipruritic soap to eliminate lice.

Second, food: For example, at the end of the First World War in 1918, the mortality rate of tuberculosis (consumption) in Europe increased significantly. Also, the Spanish flu spread globally in the autumn and winter of the same year. This was often because the reduction in food and the lack of nutrients during the war caused some people to lose their ability to resist disease. Those with profound vision and discerning minds, considering the relationship between the fortune and misfortune of the entire society, should first ensure that poor households or disaster victims are fed properly, or that they are exempted from the worry of freezing and starvation.

Third, housing: Typhus abdominalis (occurring in the abdomen with fever), scarlet fever, and diphtheria are all war-period diseases, caused by the deployment of troops during the war and the migration of the population before and after the war. People should not live together in large groups without paying attention to hygiene, as the speed of disease spread is much faster than usual. As for the southern tropical regions, meningitis transmitted through nasal breathing, plague transmitted by fleas, malaria transmitted by mosquitoes, and scrotal hydrocele transmitted by mosquito-borne filaria often run rampant in crowded factories or barracks. Therefore, the method adopted by small European countries is that whenever there is a dispute over the movement of large numbers of foreigners into their territory, they must be strictly inspected at the border and quarantined for three weeks or more before being allowed to mix freely with the outside world. Any foreign infections known as war-period diseases in the West, from infection to onset, must go through an incubation period of three days to more than twenty days, which can fortunately avoid bringing the disease into the country.

Fourth, transportation: Western science is prosperous, and there are hardly any difficult questions that doctors in various countries cannot solve regarding diseases. However, the greatest difficulty seems to be exotic diseases that have never been seen locally. For example, in August 1937, an encephalitis-lethargica similar to African sleeping sickness was discovered in Shanghai. Analyzing and translating it, it should be "en-ceph-al-itis" or "inflammation of the head" of "leth-ar-gia" or "laziness." Only experts in tropical diseases can clearly distinguish the different types of sleepiness. In addition, there are venereal diseases that belong to social problems. Patients are often shy and conceal them, and coercive methods are not feasible. It depends on the ability of private doctors to seize the opportunity to first cure the "female."

The above-mentioned plans for protecting public safety can be used as a model in various parts of our country.

### A Week's Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Bean sprouts have been on the market for a long time, and the price is not too expensive. Buying ten cents worth can be cooked into two shallow bowls. Adding some ham will make it even more. Of course, the best way to cook it is to stir-fry with shrimp. If you stir-fry shrimp, bamboo shoot cubes, and bean sprouts together, the taste is superb. However, the price of shrimp has been too expensive recently, and bamboo shoots are not cheap either, so bean sprouts stir-fried with shrimp are no longer on this economic menu. Having no choice but to consider other options, I buy two or three cents of pork, cut it into thin slices, add some water chestnut flour, and stir-fry it with bean sprouts, which is also a very good meat dish. As for vegetarian dishes, bamboo shoot shreds or dried tofu shreds can be stir-fried together, or it can be braised with tofu, which is also good with rice. However, there is one requirement: whether you make it with meat or vegetarian, you need to add more oil to make the bean sprouts taste plump and delicious. If there is too little oil, it will taste dry and not very tasty.

Tuesday: Beef with Yellow Bean Sprouts, Snow Cabbage Braised Su Fish, Fried Dough Sticks with Green Vegetables, Stewed Thick Tofu

### Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Clothing

— Long Jusheng

Tomorrow—March 12th—will be the anniversary of the death of our Founding Father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The greatness of Mr. Sun's personality, scholarship, and career is known to everyone and does not need to be elaborated on by me. Now I will talk about Mr. Sun's clothing.

I once heard a speech by Mr. Qin Yuliu, the deceased revolutionary senior and secretary of President Sun, who said: "Mr. Zhongshan's clothing has always been simple and unadorned. He wore cloth robes, cotton-padded jackets, and cloth shoes, looking like an old man from the countryside. I never saw him wear silk or fur. Even when he wore a Western suit, it was a 'Zhongshan suit' made of old cloth. As a dignified founding hero, he was so frugal! This is truly beyond the reach of ordinary people. Especially when he stepped down as president of Nanjing and returned to Shanghai, he had nothing but a shoulder bag of luggage. Moreover, he did not use servants, but carried his own rattan bag and basket. That kind of commoner demeanor was so admirable!"

After hearing Mr. Qin Yuliu's speech, although more than ten years have passed, it is still deeply imprinted in my mind. I feel that to commemorate Mr. Sun, we must cure the social disease of extravagant clothing and learn from Mr. Sun's simplicity. At this critical moment for the survival of the Chinese nation, we must practice thrift, reduce food consumption, and save the country through frugality. We must think of the soldiers on the front lines who are suffering from cold and hunger, and who are loyal, brave, and heroic. How can we, compatriots living safely on the islands, seek "clothing that is appropriate" and enjoy happiness without "cherishing material resources"?

### Two New Weapons for Water Transportation

— Lisheng

German 　　 inventors have created an aquatic　　-use automatic bicycle. This strange bicycle uses an automatic bicycle as its power and is equipped with a small boat. All kinds of driving controls are similar to the future organization on the bicycle. Three small wheels on land are used for maintenance, two in the front to 　 the car forward, and one in the back to direct the car body to turn left and right. In the water, the 　 boat floats up, and a three-bottle windmill is installed at the end, which can be rotated up and down. It is pulled up on the shore and lowered in the water, just connected to the main 　 rod. When it rotates, it pushes in the water. This amphibious vehicle can carry three people and has a speed of twelve miles per hour.

Britain currently has a new type of speedboat called the "Water Car," which, except for the lack of four wheels, is almost the same as a streamlined car. Equipped with a nine-horsepower engine, it was recently tested on the Thames and reached a top speed of 35 miles per hour.

### The Inventor of Coffee with Milk

— Chenfeng

The first person to add milk to coffee was Zuonnihoff (born in 1618 and died in 1672), who invented this method when he was working as an accountant for the West India Company in Pernambuco, Brazil. Later, he was transferred to the East India Company and became the governor of Ceylon. He was assassinated, and strangely enough, when he was assassinated in Madagascar, he was holding a milk jug and pouring milk into his coffee cup. Because he invented the method of adding milk to coffee, later generations commemorated him by building a bronze statue of him in Pernambuco.

### Random Talk About Street Trees

— Meng Bai

Tomorrow is the anniversary of the Premier's death, which is also Arbor Day: therefore, it makes me think of the urgent need to promote the planting of street trees, and here, I want to write some trivial discussions about street trees.

Enhancing Urban Beauty A prosperous city, with its rows of shops and bustling traffic, is quite lively, but if there is not a single street tree to be found on every road, no matter how we stroll on the road, we will never feel a sense of beauty. On the other hand, in a quiet place, with very few people and no traffic at all, but with green trees lining the road, we feel refreshed when we pass by, even if it is desolate. This is undoubtedly the power of street trees. Taking Shanghai as an example, street trees are planted everywhere on the roads of the French Concession, while the Public Concession generally plants far fewer. As a result, people feel better strolling on the roads of the French Concession than in the Public Concession, and everything seen in the French Concession is more aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, being able to plant street trees along the roadside also enhances the beauty of the city.

Beneficial to Public Health Street trees not only enhance urban beauty but are also closely related to public health. For example, on roads without any trees, dust and sand fly around whenever the wind blows, making walking very inconvenient and even harmful to the eyes. However, this is not the case when street trees are planted, because the trees provide shelter, weakening the force of the wind and preventing dust and sand from flying high. Some say that people living in cities have shorter lifespans than those living in the countryside, because cities are full of factories, incessant traffic, and flying coal ash, making the air extremely polluted, which leads to shorter lives. However, we all know that plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen for humans to breathe. Therefore, if street trees can be planted on the roads in cities, the polluted air will definitely be eliminated. With better air quality, people will naturally not have shorter lifespans, which proves that street trees are beneficial to public health. If we want to improve the health of residents, planting street trees is also an important task!

Providing Rest for Travelers When we are trekking long distances, if there are no street trees along the way, we will suffer twice as much as usual, whether it is the scorching sun in summer with nothing to provide shade, or the bitter north wind in winter with nothing to protect us from the cold. Even in the warm seasons of spring and autumn, a slight breeze will stir up dust, making walking inconvenient, and when we look around, we only see desolation. If traveling alone, we feel even more lonely. However, with street trees planted, there is shade in the summer, preventing direct sunlight, and trees to shield us from the wind in the winter, so that we no longer feel the piercing cold. When we are tired from walking, we can rest under the trees, and the scenery along the road is also more beautiful, providing you with appreciation at any time. Therefore, with street trees, travelers will naturally find it much more convenient!

Preventing Erosion of Residences Planting street trees next to residences also has many benefits. Taking the residence itself as an example, if there are no trees around, it will be easily eroded by wind and rain throughout the year, and the lifespan of the house will inevitably be shortened. However, if street trees are planted around the residence, the trees will provide shelter from the wind and rain, preventing them from directly impacting the house, and the house will not be eroded by wind and rain. Not only that, but in the summer, if there are no trees to shade the house from the scorching sun, the sunlight will directly hit the roof, greatly increasing the temperature inside the house, making the people living inside suffer from the heat. But with trees, the sunlight is blocked, and the room will no longer suffer from the heat. Therefore, not only should street trees be planted along the roadside, but also around the houses!

Planting Methods Street trees can benefit all aspects, as mentioned above, but when we plant street trees, we must also carefully select the species of trees. The branches and leaves should be dense, and the growth should not be too fast or too slow. Trees that grow too fast are easily blown down by the wind, while those that grow too slowly may be considered to take too long to mature, so a moderate growth rate is preferable. The distance between the trees should be consistent and orderly. The seedlings should not be too small or too large; small ones are easily trampled by cattle and sheep, while large ones are prone to death. When first planted, wooden stakes, lead wire, or other materials can be used to protect them, and after planting, attention should be paid to them at all times, and any dead trees should be replanted immediately. These are some points that should be noted when planting street trees.

Spring and Autumn

### Organizing Neighborhood Cooperatives

— Guo Minqiang

I read an article in a certain newspaper about organizing neighborhood cooperatives. The author broadly explained the need for and reasons for organizing neighborhood cooperatives at this time and in this place. This is a matter of course. In the current environment, apart from those speculative hoarders and manipulative merchants, all Shanghai citizens cannot deny the need for this kind of neighborhood cooperative organization, and it is also an urgent and pressing matter to handle. The benefits of this kind of organization are at least the following two points:

(1) Reduce or eliminate the opportunities for speculators, manipulators, and hoarders.

(2) Reduce the cost of living for citizens.

The collective rice purchase that was implemented once before was an organization similar to a cooperative. Perhaps it can also be said that this collective rice purchase organization is the predecessor of our future neighborhood cooperative organization. However, we always feel that the scope of this collective purchase (rice purchase) is too small. The scope and purpose of our purchases should be determined by the number of participants, environment, requirements, and needs of each organization. At the same time, before the organization of neighborhood cooperatives has developed or united with other neighborhood organizations to form a larger organization, the organization of the cooperative should be very simple and suitable for the masses. Here is a simple organization for reference:

(The number of people in each department can be determined according to the needs of each neighborhood organization)

Although this is a very simple organization, it is already sufficient if we can use it flexibly.

Finally, I hope that the people of the whole city will respond to and organize this kind of cooperative, and further develop it into a consumer cooperative for all the people of the city.

### Points to Note for Senders

A Letter from a Postal Worker

I have been working in the post office for many years, and I often find that the addresses on the envelopes of many letters are written very simply, resulting in errors. Because there are many places in China with the same name, if the sender does not indicate the province name, it will often lead to misdelivery and delays, and it is also very difficult for postal workers to check the letters. Therefore, the points that senders should pay attention to are summarized as follows:

(A) For letters sent by mail, in addition to well-known large commercial ports, it is best to write the province and county. For example, if someone sends a letter to "Dongxiang", and the envelope only says "Dongxiang", but Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi all have this "Dongxiang"; another example is sending a letter to "Haimen", Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces both have "Haimen"; another example is "Mengjiang", both Jilin and Guangxi provinces have this name; another example is "Shahe", Hebei, Shandong, and Guangdong provinces all have "Shahe"; another example is "Shahe Town", Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Liaoning all have the place name "Shahe Town"; another example is "Baishui", Qiyang County of Hunan Province and Xiangyin County of Hunan Province all have the place name "Baishui". The above are just rough examples, and there are many other places with the same name, which cannot be enumerated.

(B) Often, in small places where mail service has just opened, the sender does not write the detailed address, so it cannot be found, or there is any change and it is returned. Because the sender does not write the province and county names clearly, it is also impossible to return it to the original sender, and it is also feared that it will cause delays. Because the sender hands the letter to the post office, thinking that the recipient will receive it, but the recipient has not received it, and the sender has not seen it returned. If it is urgent, it is easy to cause misunderstandings. Therefore, the sender must also write the name of the place of dispatch clearly.

(C) Often, on Western-style envelopes, the place name is written upside down (according to the Western method of writing addresses on letters, the place name is written below the recipient's name, which is different from the Chinese way of writing). It is easiest for the letter checker to make a mistake when he is busy, so Chinese should be used in the Chinese format. If a foreign language is used, the foreign format should of course be used.

(D) It is best to write the envelope with a Chinese brush and in regular script, because Chinese ink has a gelatinous quality and is not easy to fall off or become blurred, while ballpoint pens or pencils are sometimes damp, causing the strokes to be unclear and the shape of the characters cannot be seen, so there are quite a few that cannot be delivered. If the above can be noted at any time, both parties will feel convenient.

### Our Thrift Association

— Zhao

Origin In the midst of rising prices and the soaring cost of living, the victims are primarily salaried workers like us. Recognizing this, colleagues have united to form a thrift association to somewhat compensate for the difficulties in life.

Name Five Friends Thrift Association (tentative)

Purpose To save unnecessary expenses and restrain daily life.

Members Temporarily five members, which can be expanded at any time.

Qualifications Any colleague in this office who vows to abide by the association's regulations.

President Publicly elected from among those with both ability and integrity.

Regulations Tentatively set at seven items:

(1) Do not purchase or consume any unnecessary items.

(2) Do not drink alcohol, do not smoke, do not gamble.

(3) Do not withdraw halfway.

(4) Hold a meeting once a month to resolve any cases proposed by members.

(5) If a new member joins, they must be introduced by a member of the association and approved by the general assembly.

(6) Anyone who violates these regulations will be fined one yuan, and all fines will be donated to charity.

(7) These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any imperfections.

The above is the charter of the thrift association that we recently gathered five colleagues to form, with the aim of saving unnecessary expenses and restraining daily life. Indeed, in the midst of rising prices, we really have a need to actively organize a thrift association to restrain our lives. This is not only beneficial to us but also very interesting.

### Discussion on "Child Punishment"

— Ji Yan

Regarding the specific methods of "child punishment," although this publication has published many articles, there are still many that seem imperfect, such as copying books and sitting still, which are not enough to leave a deep and unforgettable "punishment" impression on the minds of the punished children.

I believe that the methods of punishing children who violate the law are: (1) When a child is found to have violated the law, such as making noise or fighting, they should be asked to stand on the classroom podium and say to the other children: "XXX (your own name) violated the rules today, please do not imitate me," etc. The punished child will feel ashamed to explain their mistakes in front of everyone, and this impression of shame will always remain with them, preventing them from breaking the law again. And those children who have not been punished will also remember in their hearts that breaking the law is shameful and will not dare to do anything illegal. (2) This is a more advanced method than copying books. If a child violates the law, the teacher should explain the harm of the violation in detail to them and then punish them to write "words of warning against breaking the law," such as: "Do not make noise in the classroom, do not fight with classmates," etc. Then, the punished child will also have this lesson deeply imprinted in their minds and will not forget that breaking the law will be punished in this way.

The above two methods are punishments that my nephew received at the Hua Tong Public School for violating the law. I believe that this method of punishing children can be applied.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 21 Mixing Economics with Fiber, Promoting Mechanics to Aid Literary Achievement

Jin Danyun said, "According to the old Chinese custom, it's called 'not leaving the room for a month.' In the first month of marriage, which is the so-called honeymoon, the newlyweds must stay together. Now, this custom has also been broken. Moreover, if it comes from the couple's own intimacy, that's fine, but if it's just for the sake of custom, it's too unfree. Neither Jiancheng nor I like this kind of thing. The intimacy between husband and wife should be a permanent intimacy, not just in this one month. Besides, I'm used to being free. Unless I'm sick, I'll be bored to death if I have to stay indoors all day." While everyone was talking and laughing, they saw Shao Huihua bouncing in happily. She said, "I was going to host dinner tonight, but Miss Qu Wushuang, the editor of the 'Women's Garden' section of the newspaper, also wants to invite you. She wants to steal the role of host, so I let her have it." Zhu Airen said, "Oh dear! Miss Qu Wushuang, we don't know her. How can we bother her for nothing?" Shao Huihua said, "It doesn't matter. You don't know her, but Sister Danyun knows her. She said she's welcoming Sister Danyun's wedding, welcoming the bride, and it's a welcoming feast. Sister Danyun is the special guest, and we're all accompanying guests." Jin Danyun said, "It's all your fault for causing trouble. How would she know that I was going to visit too? You must have told her beforehand." Shao Huihua said, "Of course I told her. She came to my house just now, and I happened to mention it. She said, 'I haven't given Sister Danyun a wedding gift, so I want to steal the role of host.' You say I'm causing trouble, isn't it nice to welcome you?" Shao Huihua was sitting next to Wu Junsu. Seeing that Jin Danyun was talking to others and not paying attention, she whispered to Wu Junsu, "They're going to take her picture in a moment, because she's a new bride!" After a while, the six of them squeezed into one car again and went to the newspaper office. The newspaper office was an eight-story building, and their reception room was on the second floor. Because Shao Huihua was an employee of the newspaper, she asked them to guide them to the most exquisite reception room. The reception room also had a telephone connected to all the rooms in the newspaper office. She made a phone call to Qu Wushuang and said, "The 'guests' have arrived, please come out and greet them!" It turned out that their editorial department was on the third floor. Although the second and third floors were only one floor apart, it was easier to make a phone call than to run up a flight of stairs. Fortunately, the telephones in the newspaper office were well-connected. Not only was there a telephone in every room, but there was also a telephone on every desk. (248)

### Gambling is Rampant in the North District

— Floating Cloud

The Working Masses Enjoy This Endlessly

The Unscrupulous Thugs Quarrel and Fight

The writer lives in the North District and has recently discovered that the gambling dens in the tea houses (shuffling mahjong or digging flower cards, shuffling for five dimes or one yuan, with a cut of two dimes four cents or four dimes eight cents per shuffle) are full day and night, with no space to sit. Even small tea houses and stove vendors, as long as they are places where gambling cards are placed, are three times more profitable. Sometimes, even tea drinkers have no empty seats to entertain. This situation is staggering!

Especially on Tiantong Road, the gambling stalls on the 21st Water Gate openly gamble money in shaking jars on the sidewalk. Recently, there have been at least three stalls surrounded by people. The gamblers are generally workers, coolies, the working masses, and passing villagers. The gambling methods are the same as in other gambling dens, and the winnings and losses are also considerable. Occasionally, gamblers win and leave the stalls. These people are all unscrupulous thugs who quarrel and fight, or even have their gambling money robbed. There are many people who rely on this for a living. Locals call them "sticking close to the gambling license every day." As a result, workers, coolies, and vendors often have their hard-earned money used to support their lives, seduced by them. The weak starve, the strong steal, and even take risks, which is expected. Therefore, this is written to this publication, asking the working masses not to be tempted and fall into the abyss, so that they cannot extricate themselves.

### The Art of Listening (3)

Livingstone listened to the voices outside, and bravely went to Africa to serve the natives. All true friends of man, all thoughtful people, hear the world's needs and cries of suffering. Can true Christians living in Shanghai today, hearing the cries of more than 100,000 refugees without food or clothing, eat well and sleep peacefully? Not only that, but true Christians must also take further steps to do some constructive work: to save the current dangerous situation, to eliminate social evils, and to allow this difficult situation to be passed through peacefully. Many people, regardless of the difficulties of the present time, regardless of the life and death of others, take a cold attitude towards everything. Such selfish people, as someone said, "Selfishness is the frigid zone of life. Many people are so selfish that if you insert a thermometer into their hearts, the temperature is actually sixty degrees below zero." This is truly a sigh. What about Jesus? He listened well, he listened to the cries of those in need, those in difficulty, the poor and the suffering. If we do not listen to the needs of society and the demands of life, do not listen to the pleas of the poor, what use are we? We should listen to the inner voice and the external voice. This point has already been discussed. In addition to this, there are several other points about the art of listening that we should pay attention to. Jesus was a good listener. Before he worked, he listened with his heart for thirty years. Therefore, it is no wonder that what he said had value and was all from his own experience. Being a good listener is a good virtue for oneself, for others, and for society. When people speak lightly and carelessly, you know that their words have no value. Do you still stand there, listening politely? I think you certainly don't. Jesus meant not only that we should not listen to people's frivolous words, but also that we should actively pay attention to listening to people's advice, listening to constructive thoughts, and listening to voices that help people move forward. We should turn a deaf ear to all slander, meaningless gossip, and blasphemous and vulgar words. There is a passage in The Pilgrim's Progress that describes the Christian covering his ears and fleeing the City of Destruction, shouting "Eternal life," which is extremely meaningful. His deafness is not self-deception, but a noble action. If someone uses dirty words to speak to you, and you simply do not listen, you can be considered a gentleman. What did Jesus do when a group of bad people brought an adulterous woman before him? Jesus did not care about them, did not listen to their accusations, and even turned his back and squatted on the ground to write. Those people were all hypocrites whose own lives could not be seen by others. Would Jesus listen to their words? Therefore, at such a time, pretending to be deaf is actually a virtue for us as human beings. There is a secret to this, which is that when you are listening, you should use your heart to distinguish the truth, falsehood, right, wrong, and value of the words. We must pay attention to such distinctions, only listening to the true, the clean, and the clear words. Only then can we say that we know how to listen. "Listening" is a blessing and privilege given to man by God. Whether we receive blessings or disasters from it depends entirely on how we use it. Jesus instructed his disciples, "Listen to my words, and then you can understand." We should thank God for this ability to "listen," and express our gratitude when using it. If you want to study and inquire in detail, please write to P.O. Box 1227.
