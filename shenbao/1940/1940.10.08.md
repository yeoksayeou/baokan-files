### Thailand Plans to Join the Tripartite Pact: Thai Prime Minister Issues Statement

Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Songgram, in an interview yesterday with a reporter from "Thai Newspaper," stated that Thailand has the possibility of joining the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact. When the reporter asked about Japan sending a special envoy to Bangkok, the Prime Minister replied that the Japanese envoy's visit to Thailand is solely for investigating economic issues. However, Thailand has already studied the goals of Germany, Italy, and Japan and believes that they share the same objectives and that cooperation is possible. (Haitong Press Agency, 7th)

### Britain and America to Establish New Naval Defense Line in the Pacific: US Authorities Will Not Fear Any Threats and Will Continue to Aid China and All Democratic Countries

Vichy: French newspapers today predicted that as a result of British and American naval cooperation, a defensive blockade will soon be implemented in the Pacific, from Alaska to the Australian waters, to prevent the Japanese fleet from attacking the Western Hemisphere. The French government is eagerly awaiting President Roosevelt's speech on October 12. Speculation here is that in the speech, the US President may officially announce an agreement between Britain and the United States to establish a "sanitary zone" in the Pacific to force the Japanese fleet to remain in Asian waters. It is also believed here that the recent mobilization of US naval reservists is an indication of expanding naval activities in the near future. The "Times" reported yesterday, "If President Roosevelt's plan succeeds, a new defense line will be established to prevent various activities of the Japanese fleet and the sudden threat to Chilean ports by the Japanese navy." The newspaper also stated, "Once this plan is realized, a naval defense line starting from Hawaii and ending in Australia will extend across the Pacific, threatening British Far East bases. Recent meetings held in London and Washington have focused on discussions about the United States extending its naval defense to British New Zealand and Singapore." A famous French military expert, Duan Foe, wrote in "Daily News" yesterday, expressing doubts about Japan's ability to threaten the American continent should war break out between the US and Japan. He stated that if such a conflict occurs suddenly, naval and air battles would definitely take place in the China Sea and the Philippine Sea. He claimed that Europeans unanimously believe that a US-Japan war will eventually happen. The reason this war has not yet started is because Japan relies on economic exchanges with the Americas. However, if Japan obtains guarantees for trade with China, then Japan can adopt some methods to break away from its dependence on the United States. From a current political and military standpoint, Japan has no possibility of waging war on the American continent. Even if war breaks out, it can only take place near the Philippines. Although Japan has gradually established defensive obstacles in front of the Asian continent, it cannot cross the Pacific to the American continent due to its lack of bases. If the United States is not forced to abandon the Philippines during wartime, then the United States will surely win the first naval battle and establish hegemony in the Pacific." (United Press, 7th)

Washington: According to political circles here, the recall of the US naval reserve, which occurred shortly after Navy Secretary Knox's announcement on Saturday that the US was prepared to fight if forced, shows the US authorities' determination to ignore Japan's empty threats. Japan's three years of war against China have left it mired in economic difficulties, which worsen month by month. Its pronouncements that the US's maintenance of the status quo in the Far East is plunging itself into crisis only provoke ridicule from those in US officialdom who know the truth. Japan is trying to create political difficulties for the United States, but the American public will not be easily intimidated, as Navy Secretary Knox has made clear. If Japan makes a suicidal attack on the US, then the US fleet is ready and waiting. The hope held by isolated factions that the US will not adopt a firm stance will ultimately prove to be a fatal illusion. (Reuters, 7th)

Washington: The Washington "Star" editorial yesterday, "Give Japan a Lesson," again urged the US government to adopt a tough stance towards Japan. The newspaper stated that attempting to compromise with Japan would be a "dangerous folly." The newspaper said that the United States should immediately take "practical steps to curb the enormous ambitions of the Japanese government." These steps should include economic sanctions against Japan, active assistance to the Chinese government, and military understandings with Britain in the Far East. The newspaper also stated, "When Japan goes on to try to crush China and seize the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, it would be a great folly for the United States to stand idly by."

US Holds Naval Conference Yesterday to Discuss Far East Issues Extensively

Washington: Diplomatic circles here are eager to learn the results of this morning's naval conference, as the decisions regarding the deployment of the US fleet, the joint US-British use of Singapore, and the US's maintenance of the status quo in the Far East may all need to be discussed. This morning, US Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Richardson, Navy Secretary Knox, and other officials held a meeting. Due to the tension in the Far East, it is expected that Knox and Richardson have discussed extensive issues, such as the ability of the United States to maintain the status quo in the Far East and the issue of joint US-British use of Singapore and Australian bases. Furthermore, diplomatic circles speculate that other issues may also be under discussion, such as: (1) Whether the US fleet can be sent to bases in the Philippines and utilize them in emergencies; (2) Whether the US fleet can remain stationed in Hawaii indefinitely without affecting its effectiveness; (3) Whether the Asiatic Fleet can be expanded; (4) What is the relationship between the newly established Atlantic Patrol and the main fleet in the Pacific. Diplomatic circles said that the future of the entire US Far East policy will depend on this conference as a turning point. (United Press, 7th)

Los Angeles: Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Richardson flew to Washington today. This Pacific defense leader will meet with US President Roosevelt and Navy Secretary Knox to discuss matters closely. (International News Service, 7th)

New York: The New York Daily News editorial today denounced as absurd the Japanese suggestion that the United States abandon its naval base at Pearl Harbor as a prelude to adjusting US-Japan relations. It stated that an Axis victory in Europe may prompt Japan and the Axis powers to attack the US. Therefore, the US should quickly strengthen its defenses in the Pacific, increasing its existing forces twofold. "Our main objective should be to pay close attention to the defense of our Pacific coast and sweep away any defensive ideas in the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Indochina, or British India." (United Press, 7th)

Knox's Warning Agreed to by US Congressmen from Both Parties

Washington: Leading members of Congress stated last night that Navy Secretary Colonel Knox's speech on Saturday and the measure to order the recall of naval reservists were a kind of warning to Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo, and that the United States was prepared to accept any challenge from the Axis powers. It is said that Colonel Knox's speech has caught the attention of people around the world, that if the Axis powers take any further action, whether that action directly or indirectly threatens the security of the United States, then the United States will not hesitate to resist with force. The US Navy Secretary's speech has made it even more impossible for President Roosevelt's government to compromise for the sake of protecting US interests. Several prominent congressmen even believe that the United States may desperately need peace, but not at any cost to seek peace. Congressmen here also emphatically stated that US assistance to other democratic countries and China will not be suspended due to threats from the Tripartite Pact. Several senators speculated that Britain and the United States would unite with China to confront Japan. Senator Pepper, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, "Colonel Knox announced our country's position. What we need is peace, but we are not willing to be manipulated by others. Our assistance to democratic countries should be determined by ourselves and not stopped by orders from others. If Britain and the United States want to exchange bases anywhere in the Far East, we will act according to our own will and will not pay attention to the opinions of others." Another member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Green, said, "What Colonel Knox said truly represents the views of the American people and Congress." He also stated, "The speech should make the dictatorial regimes sit up and think. We are telling them that the American people do not want to adopt a policy of appeasement towards them anymore. We are telling them that we hope for peace, but we will never give up important rights to avoid war." Another senator on the committee, O'Mahoney, said, "The Navy Secretary's speech is a declaration of the United States' policy to move forward courageously." Senator Holt, an isolationist on the Senate Naval Committee and a long-time opponent of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, also stated that the United States does not want to adopt a policy of appeasement, but he acknowledged that Knox's remarks were a candid attempt to attack Germany, Italy, and Japan. He said, "I have long felt that we are bound to be drawn into the vortex of war, and this speech will bring us even closer to war." (United Press, 7th)

### US-Japan Relations Cannot Be Adjusted: Konoe and Matsuoka's Speeches Respond to Further Deterioration

Tokyo: When a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Suma, met with reporters today, he was asked if there were any specific outlines in Tokyo or Washington that could serve as a basis for adjusting relations between the US and Japan. The spokesman replied that in the current situation, there is no room for adjusting relations between Japan and the United States, because the United States insists on first resolving the outstanding issues between the two countries. When asked whether Japan would regard the various actions taken by the United States to date, such as embargoes, as "a challenge to Japan," using the same term recently used by Prime Minister Konoe, the spokesman replied that discussing Prime Minister Konoe's reply would not be prudent. Prime Minister Konoe has exhausted his thoughts and studied the anti-Japanese embargoes and other actions taken by the United States, outside of his speech. (Reuters, 7th)

Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Konoe today warned his people, urging them to prepare for potentially worse situations that may occur. Foreign Minister Matsuoka also delivered a speech. Both men spoke at the prefectural governors' conference. Konoe said, "The purpose of Japan's new alliance is to avoid the expansion of war and to accelerate the realization of peace. All my local officials should guide the people well and overcome the current difficult period together." However, Konoe did not make any specific remarks about the United States. Matsuoka claimed that Japan is prepared to share natural benefits with all countries in the world that do not interfere with Japan's intention to build a new chain of happiness in East Asia. The intention of Japan signing the Tripartite Pact is not to say that Japan will immediately participate in the European war, nor does it mean that all countries other than Germany and Italy are our enemies. As for Japan's invasion of China, if third countries wish to reduce losses in China, they should do their best to quickly seek a solution to this matter. Matsuoka said that there are four different perspectives in the China War: (1) Japan embraces the spirit of union and cooperation with China; (2) Chiang Kai-shek, based on anti-Japanese ideas, wants to balance Japan's power in East Asia; (3) Britain and the US originate from the ideal of maintaining the status quo; (4) The Soviet Union embraces the communist ideas of the workers' revolution. (United Press, 7th)

Tokyo: The Yomiuri Shimbun today carried a moderate-toned article, stating that US Undersecretary of State Welles said at a meeting of the American Foreign Affairs Association in Cleveland on September 28 that there is no problem in the Far East that cannot be peacefully resolved through negotiation. The sentiment of these remarks is sufficient to govern the basic spirit of the negotiations between Japan and the United States to adjust relations. This sentiment can ensure that Japan respects American interests in China and reopens the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, as the Japanese are indeed seeking to build diplomatic relations with the United States. American power holders have never paid attention to Japan's conciliatory suggestions. Now that one of them has suddenly made this remark, it is truly surprising. We are still prepared to forgive the past and ask President Roosevelt to reconsider his attitude towards Japan. The article also said that Prime Minister Konoe's remarks on Friday that the peace of the Pacific depends on the US attitude towards Japan are a serious warning to the US. (Reuters, 7th)

### Britain, America, and Soviet Union Reach Tentative Understanding: If Japan Overthrows the Status Quo in the Pacific, It Will Face Economic Sanctions from the Three Countries

Washington: Authoritative sources here said today that if Japan attempts to further overthrow the status quo in the Pacific, then the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union may immediately impose an economic blockade on Japan. Sources with considerable information claim that talks outside of Washington, London, and Moscow have produced a tentative understanding. However, they acknowledge that the Soviet Union's attitude is still somewhat unclear, but after the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union discussed matters with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last week, they both telegraphed their governments that the results were very good. It is believed that the terms of the British and American embargoes may have already been agreed upon, but Secretary of State Hull refused to comment on this news. It was indicated that the British and American governments may be waiting for clarification of the Soviet Union's attitude. Diplomats here said they believe that even if German pressure prevents the Soviet Union from joining the anti-Japanese front, the Soviet Union will maintain a bystander attitude for its own benefit and will not hinder the embargo against Japan. A US government official told reporters that in his personal opinion, the formation of an anti-Japanese front is now the key point of the US government's foreign policy. As for relations between Japan and the United States, it can be seen from the speeches of Konoe and Matsuoka, as well as the US Navy Secretary Knox's response, that they have further deteriorated. The mobilization of the US naval reserve also has the tendency to increase the state of tension between the two countries. It is believed here that President Roosevelt firmly believes that economic sanctions alone by the United States are not enough to change Japan's path, so cooperation with other countries is necessary. It has been pointed out here that if the United States begins to embargo high-octane aviation gasoline, Japan will immediately obtain it from British-Iranian oil companies in the Persian Gulf. It is said that the British-American oil companies in the Dutch East Indies are also selling oil to Japan. (International News Service, 7th)

### Soviet-Japanese Negotiations

Editorial

### Japan's Policy Towards the US and the Soviet Union

After joining the German-Italian group and signing the Tripartite Pact, Japan has repeatedly made threatening remarks towards the United States and attempted to exchange recognition of American leadership in the Western Hemisphere for American recognition of the so-called "New Order in Greater East Asia," showing that it has not yet abandoned its lingering delusion. However, to say that the Japanese authorities still believe that there is room for the US policy to waver and that there are ways to salvage US-Japanese relations would be too delusional. At present, it is no longer making any efforts through diplomatic channels, but is only aiming at the eve of the US presidential election, spreading the terror of war to the United States in order to exploit isolationist elements, strengthen isolationist consciousness, and attack Roosevelt, hoping that the US president may be replaced and the successor may even change national policy. In fact, although the United States takes the Far East and its own security and interests as the subject of debate in the political struggle, there is no fundamental divergence in views and attitudes due to the opposition between the two parties, both in and out of office. Therefore, no matter what the result of the US election next month, Japan's hope in ten thousand will ultimately be disappointed. Not only that, but further decisions and actions by the United States, under normal circumstances, may be observed as waiting until after the presidential election is over. However, the tension and importance of various international situations have never been greater than they are now. The procedures for all political and diplomatic measures may not necessarily be as observed in general methods and may not wait until another day. Just look at the recent sudden recall of naval reserve soldiers to get a glimpse. The Japanese side can of course also see this, so it is making various attempts towards the United States, and what it is racking its brains to do is still to find ways to adjust its relations with the Soviet Union. Japan's repulsion of the United States, in addition to its positive role, also serves, in another sense, to show goodwill to the Soviet Union.

It is unknown whether there are any secret appendices to the Tripartite Pact outside the public provisions and what the content of the secret documents may be. Judging only from the surface of the public provisions, what the pact stipulates is only principles. Principles should be universally applicable, but the Soviet Union is an exception. Therefore, analyzing it from a formal perspective, assuming that any other country helps Britain fight against Germany and Italy, or helps China fight against Japan, then Germany, Italy, and Japan will help each other based on the pact; assuming that the Soviet Union helps Britain or China, then because the pact has a provision for the three countries to maintain relations with the Soviet Union, it can be interpreted as not applying the principle of mutual assistance under the pact to the Soviet Union.

This interpretation is permissible in a theoretical way. Whether it can actually be applied depends on the actions of the Soviet Union. How to interpret it, of course, is also one of the powers of a totalitarian country and does not necessarily need to be discussed in advance. However, the goodwill and fear of the three countries towards the Soviet Union are undeniable due to this provision in the pact. All three countries agree, and Japan is probably even more so. In Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's recent speech, he expressed his resentment towards the United States, but there was no need to be so particularly resentful in the pact's superficial principles. However, in the speech, he also specifically mentioned adjusting relations with the Soviet Union. Comparing the United States and the Soviet Union side by side cannot but be seen as using the United States as a foil, that is, to show particular goodwill to the Soviet Union. Originally, the Soviet Union also believed that it was not impossible to adjust relations with Japan, and its Foreign Commissar Molotov once said so publicly. If the authorities of the two countries expressed this way and Konoe also claimed that "the adjustment of relations with the Soviet Union in political and economic terms is now underway," it is known that there must be something brewing between them. The brewing may not be without results, but what Japan can gain is another question mark beyond the Tripartite Pact. Because the Soviet Union is a powerful country on the shores of the Pacific, and until now, it has not revealed its willingness to participate in the Pacific conflict. Furthermore, judging from its assistance to China in the past three years, the Soviet Union will never approve of Japan's arbitrary aggression in the East Asian continent. The space between these two boundaries is what the Soviet Union considers the place where "the adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations is not impossible"! Japan's hope for the Soviet Union from the beginning was that the Soviet Union would tolerate Japan's aggression in the East Asian continent and stop Soviet aid to China. This is the main purpose of Japan's hope to adjust its relations with the Soviet Union in recent years. Even now, Japan has not necessarily abandoned this wish. Its ultimate disappointment goes without saying. Until Konoe took over as Prime Minister again and even after the conclusion of the recent Tripartite Pact, the US response made it clear that the US not only would not be deterred by the pact, but would become more active because of the stimulus of the pact. As a result, the content and purpose of Japan's expected adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations will undergo major changes. Simply put, Japan's relationship with the US is extremely difficult and dangerous, so it has to fear and show goodwill to the Soviet Union because of the Pacific storm. Therefore, Japan's so-called policy towards the Soviet Union in the past focused on China; the policy towards the Soviet Union in the future may focus on the US. We have a consistent understanding of the US-Japanese dispute, but we guess that the Soviet Union's views will not be entirely the same as ours. We believe that the Sino-Japanese War is a war of aggression and anti-aggression, while the conflict between the US and Japan is a conflict between democracy and totalitarianism, a conflict between civilization and happiness and military authority. In the Soviet Union, it completely agrees with the war of aggression and anti-aggression between China and Japan and has always sympathized with anti-aggression; as for the US-Japanese dispute, it may be regarded as a possible development into an equal war between imperialists, that is, the future Pacific storm will be regarded as the current European war. From this point of view, the current Japan may not hope to achieve a situation similar to that between the Soviet Union and Germany! What is different is that after the Soviet Union and Germany reconciled, Germany strengthened its determination to fight against Britain; if the Soviet Union and Japan reconciled, Japan would only strengthen its threatening attitude towards the US, because until now, no one can believe that Japan, in addition to threatening the US, hopes to scare the US away and has prepared for war against the US.

### Britain Informs the Soviet Union That It Will Reopen the Burma Road: If Japan Attacks the Road, Britain Will See It as a Threat to Singapore

Stockholm: According to the London correspondent of the "Svenska Dagbladet", well-informed British sources expect the Burma Road to be reopened on the 18th of this month. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi has repeatedly visited the British Foreign Office to meet with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and has contacted British Prime Minister Churchill to discuss the Burma Road issue. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has also repeatedly visited Downing Street. The British government has stated its intention to reopen the Burma Road to the Soviet Ambassador. The correspondent went on to say that British personnel have already stated that if Japanese aircraft bomb the Burma Road, Britain will regard it as a demonstration against Singapore. It is said that there are currently a large number of freight trucks and mules on the Sino-Burmese border, preparing to transport munitions. (Haitong Press Agency, 7th)

Tokyo: A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that the Japanese government has not taken any steps regarding the Burma Road, which began to be blockaded on July 18th in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Agreement. As for whether the government will take any steps on it, it is also impossible to say. (Reuters, 7th)

Tokyo: Foreign Minister Matsuoka said today, after mentioning the new loans the US made to China, "Although we do not intend to provoke any country, we must make every effort to oppose any powerful country's assistance to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in order to prolong the Chinese war and delay the restoration of peace in East Asia. The Japanese government is now watching whether Britain will reopen the Burma Road, because this move can test Britain's attitude towards Japan after the Tripartite Pact. The Chinese incident is an inappropriate war, and it is difficult to avoid the impact on the interests of third countries, especially the interests used to resist our military actions. Matsuoka said that there are four different views in the Chinese war: (1) Japan embraces the spirit of uniting and cooperating with China; (2) Chairman Chiang, based on anti-Japanese concepts, wants to balance Japan's power in East Asia; (3) Britain and the US arise from the ideal of maintaining the status quo; (4) The Soviet Union embraces the communist righteousness of the workers' revolution. (Reuters, 7th)

Tokyo: "Kokumin Shimbun" reported that, regarding the opening of the Burma Road, the attitudes of the Far Eastern countries and the intervention of Britain and the United States are becoming increasingly extreme. On the US side, President Roosevelt's election platform is based on assisting Britain, and there are other indications that the US is about to interfere in Far Eastern affairs. If this causes a conflict between the two countries in the Pacific, then the US should be responsible for it. As for the opening of the Burma Road and the US decision, Japanese troops are already in Vietnam, preparing to take action. (Haitong Press Agency, 7th)

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers here today again issued threats to Britain and the United States, saying that if the Burma Road is reopened this month, allowing the Chongqing government to transport various military supplies, then Japan will take "certain self-defense measures" against Britain and the United States. (United Press, 7th)

Tokyo: "Hochi Shimbun" published an editorial today, stating that if Britain does open the Burma Road, Japan will consider this action to be a breach of Britain's promise and a move that is unfriendly to Japan. (Haitong Press Agency, 7th)

### Thai-Vietnamese Border Dispute - French Side Claims - Thailand Has Not Made Clear Demands - The Statement of the Thai Ambassador to the US is Apparently Propaganda - The US Will Suspend the Delivery of Thai-Purchased Military Supplies

Vichy - Sources in charge here declare that the French government will not change its attitude towards Thailand's territorial demands on Vietnam. Regarding the announcement made by the Thai Embassy in the United States, which stated that Thailand intends to peacefully resolve the Vietnamese issue with France and pointed out that Thailand and Vietnam should use the Mekong River as the new border, incorporating the Dongpu Zhai and Luoan areas into Thailand, French figures here believe the above request is clearly propaganda.

### Australian Government Accelerates Shipbuilding - Fifty Ships to Be Launched Before the End of Next Year

Sydney - The Australian government's naval construction order stipulates that 50 warships will be built by around the end of next year, so it is actively proceeding. All Australian shipyards are working overtime. Ten of these new ships are being built for the British Navy, and the rest are for the Australian Navy. All ships will be launched before the end of next year in preparation for deployment. The engineering of each ship is being undertaken by Australia, and the design of each ship is also being done by Australia. Australia's ability to start building such a large program of more than fifty patrol ships in a short period of time is the result of careful planning before the war. Before the war, Australia began building two destroyers and two troop transports, as well as several harbor defense ships. But after an investigation by naval authorities, it was decided what kind of large number of warships Australia could quickly build in case of emergency. The Navy Department then planned a type of ship that could be quickly built by Australian shipyards and have the value of sweeping mines, resisting submarines, and repelling aircraft. The British Navy Department was very pleased to see this and ordered twenty ships from Australia. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

It is generally speculated that Romania will completely embrace the Axis powers. As proof of Romania's increased cooperation with the Axis powers, Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu was seen here yesterday wearing the green uniform of the Iron Guard, appearing before the public. Antonescu was formerly an opponent of the Iron Guard, but this time he changed his previous attitude, wearing the Iron Guard uniform and participating in the Iron Guard National Congress held in Bucharest.

It is reported that within three or four days, Germany and Italy will express their support to the Antonescu government, which is controlled by the Iron Guard. Germany and Italy's support for Romania is widely believed to be a concrete expression of Germany and Italy's promise at the Vienna conference to defend Romania against external pressure. Reliable sources made a strong recommendation last night that German secret organizations, even regular German troops, should be established in Romania to help Romania form an army and police, and protect Romanian oil fields. After General Antonescu explained the goals of the Iron Guard at the meeting, he personally swore an oath to all Iron Guard members.

### British Air Force Raids Krupp Armament Factory in a Lightning Strike - Two Tons of High Explosives Dropped - Hamm, Rotterdam, and Other Locations Also Attacked

London - The Air Ministry Information Office announced that on Saturday night, the British Air Force, in a lightning-fast operation, raided the Krupp armament factory in Essen, Germany, dropping two tons of high explosives from high altitude. Other targets included military objectives in Hamm, Osnabrück, and Cologne; ships in Rotterdam and Brest; a transport convoy in Gravelines; shipyards in Amsterdam and Flushing; and four airfields including Schiphol. Weather conditions in the British aircraft operating area were extremely poor. The bombers braved severe cold, low clouds, and intense thunderstorms and rain, carrying out the attacks. Most of the routes required blind flying. During the attack on Brest, large ships in the harbor and dry docks were damaged. One pilot reported that a bomb he dropped hit a road next to the pier and caused a series of explosions, apparently hitting an ammunition dump. British aircraft that reached the Ruhr area located oil factories in the Gelsenkirchen area, repeatedly bombing them for about half an hour. The factory area was hit, and there were successive explosions, with fires breaking out in several places, one of which spread rapidly. When British aircraft attacked Hamm, they dropped bombs on cargo, causing explosions and fires. In Osnabrück, near the railway siding, a bomb hit, causing a loud explosion and fire. During the attack on Rotterdam, large bombs hit and set fire to buildings along the dockyards and the north bank. British aircraft targeted the shipyard area on the south bank of the river in Amsterdam, hitting it with bombs and causing a large fire. During the attack on Flushing, large bombs hit the shipyard, causing continuous explosions for ten minutes and a large fire. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

London - A detailed record of British Air Force bombings of German territory since the start of the war has recently been released for the first time. The number of enemy military targets heavily attacked by the British Air Force exceeds two hundred. The person who planned these British aircraft attacks has now been appointed to a new position, and will command an even larger British Air Force offensive. That person is Air Marshal Sir Charles Portal, the former commander of the Bomber Command, and the newly appointed Chief of the Air Staff. The British Air Force's bombings have mostly been carried out in German-occupied areas. According to the Information Office, the destruction of concentrated ships by British aircraft during attacks on German bases, has not only eliminated the threat of a German landing in England, but has also significantly impacted the use of German inland waterway transport. The destroyed ships were barges from the Rhine and other German inland rivers, on which Germany has traditionally relied to transport goods. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

British Air Force Uses Precision Methods to Bomb German Industrial Areas

London - The Air Ministry revealed today that since the British Air Force adopted the scientific bombing method of "skilled planning," in more than seven hundred battles, large and small, it has rendered Hitler's industrial war machine crippled. It is claimed that within Germany itself, two hundred military targets have been bombed. British bombers have flown over Germany's important oil refining centers, ammunition factories, and railways, creating a destructive network. They scientifically coordinated their attack operations, and at strategically appropriate times, launched repeated attacks to hinder repair work. Almost all major towns in the Ruhr industrial area have been bombed. The British side also claimed that Germany's major seaports of Hamburg and Bremen have been reduced to ruins. The Air Ministry stated that the damage to enemy harbors and railways was so severe that not a single pound of military supplies was transported into Germany from Denmark in the past three weeks. The Information Office today released a map showing the eight areas in Germany that were bombed. Officials stated that each raid was carefully planned to gradually eliminate Hitler's war machine. However, the Information Office's report on the air raids did not include the bombing of airfields and ports in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. (7th International Electric)

### No Air Raids Over the Entire British Isles Last Night - German Aircraft Attacked London This Morning and Were Repelled

London - Last night, air raids in London and throughout the British Isles were temporarily suspended. This was the first time in over a month. After the London air defenses repelled German aircraft before 9 PM, the entire city was very quiet. Throughout the British Isles, not a single aircraft was heard. Millions of Londoners, although still taking refuge in air raid shelters, enjoyed their first uninterrupted sleep since September 7th. The silence of the air raids in London may have been due to the winds in the English Channel, but the people of London believe that it may be a sign of a major storm to come, as it is reported that Hitler is concentrating his forces for the invasion of England. The silence over London made the public feel rather apprehensive. (7th International Electric)

London - After one of the quietest nights since the start of the German aerial blitz, British and German aircraft engaged in fierce battles over England again today. Initial reports indicate that several enemy aircraft have been shot down by the British, including two bombers and one fighter. The center of the enemy aircraft attack was on the Kent coast. A large group of enemy bombers, protected by multiple Messerschmitt aircraft, flew over the area and were only dispersed by intercepting British fighter aircraft. There were several daytime air raids in the London area, during one of which several locations were bombed by enemy aircraft, causing slight property damage and minor casualties. On one occasion, more than a dozen enemy aircraft in two groups infiltrated the skies over southeast London, dropped several bombs, and then quickly retreated. Yesterday evening, a single enemy aircraft dropped bombs on the outskirts of London, causing very little damage and no casualties. In addition, a German aircraft flew over the south coast and dropped several bombs in several places. Apart from the above, there were no other activities over England last night. (7th Reuters Agency Dispatch)

London - Starting yesterday morning, several German aircraft, using low clouds as cover, flew across the coast towards London. They were driven away by intense anti-aircraft fire before they could infiltrate the city center. A German bomber in northwest London was pursued and shot down. Shortly thereafter, London issued two more alerts. Several enemy aircraft individually flew over the Thames River towards London. Enemy aircraft were again spotted in northwest London. During the air battle in southeast England yesterday morning, a German fighter was shot down. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

London - The Air Ministry issued a communique last night stating that on Sunday, enemy aircraft, either alone or in small groups, attacked several locations in southeastern England and the London area. A few bombs were dropped in the East Midlands and East Anglia. High explosive bombs in Folkestone and a town in Northamptonshire destroyed several houses and caused minor casualties. In several other places, enemy aircraft also dived through the clouds and opened fire with machine guns before quickly flying away, injuring several people. Although bombs were also dropped in several other locations, the damage and casualties were minor. Due to poor weather, it was difficult for British fighter aircraft to intercept. However, as of now, it is reported that one enemy bomber has been shot down. In the week before midnight on October 5th, 104 German aircraft were confirmed to have been destroyed in aerial combat over England. Damaged or possibly lost German aircraft are not included.

### German Ship Sinks British Ship in the Atlantic

London - The crew of the British ship "Hauxley" (5207 tons) landed at a port in Scotland on Saturday after being sunk. According to the crew, there is a German raiding ship in the Atlantic Ocean that uses an extendable smokestack to change its appearance and frequently repaints its hull and changes the flags it flies to conceal itself as a German ship. It was found that the "Hauxley" was sunk on April 14th. The captain and twenty-three crew members were transferred by the German raiding ship to a Norwegian merchant ship, and then transferred by a British submarine to Gibraltar. According to the crew's report, the German raiding ship initially issued an order to stop, but the British ship did not comply. The German ship then opened fire, killing a gunner and damaging the deck structures and lifeboats. As the hull sank, the German ship launched a small boat to rescue the crew and place them on board, detaining them for two months. The German ship later captured a Norwegian merchant ship and transferred the crew to it. This Norwegian ship drifted for another two months, heading towards Germany, but was eventually intercepted by a British submarine. The enemy raiding ship's food consisted of black bread, sweet potatoes, coffee, and a small amount of butter. Eating this for a long time affected their health. The crew did not fully worship Hitler. One medic openly called Hitler crazy, and said that many Germans did not want to fight. (7th Reuters Dispatch)

European War Talks (10)(9)

### Spy Hysteria in Europe and America

There are also signs of collaboration with the enemy among British fascists, and many spies are also communists. Under instructions from Moscow, they incite unrest in armaments factories and spread the theory that this war is nothing more than an imperialist conflict.

Fascist elements specialize in obtaining intelligence from British upper-class society. In terms of social status, they can operate in upper-class society, which is not the case for communists. According to statistics from the beginning of this year, there are 60,000 enemy aliens residing in Britain, and less than 1,000 have been imprisoned. This lenient British approach may have gone on for too long in a war of survival. As a result, many dangerous spies have slipped through the net. Britain has also taken in thousands of refugees, mostly educated Czechs and Poles, who are sometimes bought off due to their poverty.

As of now, there are still 20,000 German aliens residing in Britain, and together with British fascists and communists, they can form a powerful plainclothes force. The first strict measure taken by Britain against plainclothes forces was to detain thousands of enemy men residing on the eastern and southern coasts. Nationals of neutral or friendly countries in the aforementioned areas should also report to the police station every day and are not allowed to travel by car or bicycle. They should stay at home after 8 PM every night and before 6 AM in the morning and should not go out. War Secretary Eden has also formed civil defense groups to patrol various areas. The main purpose is to prevent paratroopers and plainclothes forces from colluding.

At the end of May, Britain also imprisoned 4,000 enemy aliens from various places.

At the same time, a law was passed to punish traitors, stipulating that offenses such as conspiracy, sabotage, obstructing military affairs, spying on military information, and aiding the enemy internally would be punishable by death. Small-scale searches of domestic fascists and communists are underway. Originally, less than 200 women were imprisoned, but after the German occupation of the Netherlands, many female spies were found to be collaborating on the island, so Britain also paid attention to this danger. Several women have been imprisoned. British fascist leaders Oswald Mosley and his wife have also been imprisoned.

J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI

is also very serious. Although all three political parties in Ireland have united to prevent treasonous activities, the Germans at the German embassy in Dublin have had the opportunity to contact the Irish Republican Army. In an extreme situation, British troops may have to occupy major Irish seaports for security.

Is there also spy hysteria in the United States? According to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, there is. Even if the United States has only one spy, he can still harm the United States. Even if he obtains one state secret, it is enough to endanger the safety of countless American citizens. Napoleon's spy agency was led by only one person, but that person's network of contacts was naturally very large. All espionage activities are similar in nature. This has been the case throughout history, and the modern situation is no exception.

Some people in the United States outwardly maintain a calm demeanor, saying that discussing spy terror is boring. However, if there is no espionage activity in the United States, how were secret aircraft blueprints stolen? How did a treasonous naval officer betray naval secrets? Since September 1939, the FBI has received many reports of espionage and sabotage.

In the five years before 1938, the FBI had to resolve an average of thirty-five cases of espionage, sabotage, and leakage of national defense secrets each year. By 1938, the number of such cases had reached no less than two hundred and fifty, and in 1939, it jumped to one thousand six hundred and fifty-one. There are more now. This is naturally not a reassuring situation.

Spies and sabotage are related. When conspiracies occur, sabotage will also occur. The scope of espionage has expanded and is no longer limited to military secrets. Spies have infiltrated all aspects of American commerce, industry, and society. The situation with sabotage is also the same. According to an FBI investigation, the United States has these foreign conspirators who are willing to harm the United States to repay America's preferential treatment. The recent unauthorized sale of hundreds of feet of film to foreign countries can only be seen as espionage activity. This type of film shows the locations of American air bases. If other countries obtain this film, they can accurately hit their desired targets from the air by following the map. These films, when discovered, were certainly a threat to American security. This is just one example. There are many other espionage activities in the United States that concern national defense secrets and cannot be discussed publicly. Spy agencies are making every effort to explore the progress of American national defense plans. President Roosevelt appealed to local authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation across the United States on September 6th last year to cooperate and strictly prevent espionage, sabotage, and other activities. At that time, he ordered the FBI to investigate these incidents and ordered the addition of 150 special agents, earmarking funds to increase work efficiency.

At the time of the last World War, the United States had extremely poor intelligence agencies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was just in its infancy. The current situation has changed. The Army and Navy intelligence departments are well organized and highly efficient. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also fully matured.

To cope with the current situation, the FBI has stationed detectives in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii to closely monitor the US defense outposts.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also established agencies in six new cities in the United States so that militarily important strongholds can benefit from increased security with the assistance of additional special agents.

In the early summer of last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation established a department to teach specialized knowledge of investigating espionage and sabotage. In addition, the US Army and Navy ordered the FBI to protect thousands of factories that have contracts with the government to rush production of military equipment.

In short, Americans still remember the lessons of the last World War and are currently on high alert. (End)

### British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, Admiral Noble, Arrives in Shanghai. Rumor Has It He Will Meet with Hart to Discuss the Situation in the Far East. American Military and Political Officers Held a Meeting Yesterday. American Naval Reservists in Shanghai Stand Ready to Depart.

Following the news that the British and American navies will jointly blockade the Japanese navy in the Pacific, morale has greatly increased in Shanghai. After the establishment of the Axis powers among Germany, Italy, and Japan, the joint action of Britain and the United States to respond to aggressors in the Far East will undoubtedly create a favorable situation for China's war of resistance. Furthermore, the sudden arrival in Shanghai of Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, to confer with Admiral Hart of the United States, is also cause for celebration. A reporter from Pingming News Agency learned yesterday from well-informed sources in foreign diplomatic circles that Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, arrived suddenly in Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday morning, Admiral Hart, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, also held an important joint meeting of military and political officers. Some authoritative figures in Shanghai believe that Admiral Noble's arrival in Shanghai is related to a meeting with Hart to discuss close cooperation between the British and American fleets in the Far East. However, this claim has not yet been confirmed by the authorities of both countries, as both British and American officials are maintaining strict silence on the matter.

American Officers Held Meeting Yesterday

It is reported that at approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, Admiral Hart, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol, and Colonel Baker, Commander of the U.S. Garrison in Shanghai, arrived at the U.S. Consulate on Jiangxi Road one after another and held an important meeting with U.S. Consul General Butrick and other senior military and political officers. Colonel Baker left first at approximately 11:00 AM, followed by Admiral Hart and Rear Admiral Glassford at 11:30 AM. Although the contents of the meeting are unknown, it is widely believed that they discussed the future development of the situation in the Far East.

British Commander-in-Chief Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong

Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, recently relinquished his post. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency who inquired with relevant parties, Admiral Noble departed from Hong Kong a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai the night before last. When inquiring with British officials in Shanghai yesterday, they confirmed that Admiral Noble was passing through Shanghai on his way back to London, England. However, according to sources who first informed Pingming News Agency about Admiral Noble's arrival, it is believed that Noble is in Shanghai to meet with Admiral Hart to discuss cooperation between the British and American fleets in the Far East. Therefore, it is feared that Noble will also contact U.S. naval authorities during his trip to the United States via Shanghai before returning to England. However, the aforementioned reports have not yet been confirmed by British and American officials stationed in Shanghai. Nevertheless, the significance of Noble's arrival in Shanghai is widely believed to be significant by all parties.

American Reservists Stand Ready to Depart

The English-language newspaper *The China Press* reports that after Washington issued a mobilization order yesterday (the 6th) calling for naval reservists to join the U.S. fleet, approximately fifty U.S. naval reservists in Shanghai are awaiting orders to depart today (the 7th). Some of them said this morning that they expect to receive firm orders tomorrow (the 8th). It is reported that these naval reservists will not necessarily join the U.S. Navy's Yangtze River Patrol. It is widely believed that a small number of reservists may soon be transferred to the USS *Augusta* for immediate service, while the remaining reservists are expected to receive orders to return to the United States, or they may not board ships for service at sea, but instead perform heavy work on shore. It is reported that among the fifty naval reservists currently stationed in Shanghai who are members of the American community, two are ill and hospitalized in critical condition. Most of the remaining forty or so have been residing in Shanghai for many years, and many of them own or work as waiters in cafes and bars on Zhubao Road and other locations.

Arousing Exceptional Concern in Shanghai

The *North-China Daily News* reports that the announcement by the U.S. Navy Department yesterday (the 6th) to mobilize all reservists of the "L" formed fleet and Marine Corps has aroused exceptional concern in Shanghai. It is estimated that there are approximately one hundred U.S. fleet reservists residing in Shanghai, some of whom have been living in Shanghai for many years and engaged in commerce. Whether these individuals will comply with Washington's orders and enlist is still unclear by the official announcement, causing much speculation.

Mobilization Order Expected

However, yesterday's telegram from Washington stated that the Navy Department had already mobilized all naval reservists, except for volunteer reservists. Therefore, it is expected that the U.S. Navy Department's order will also apply to U.S. Navy reservists residing in the Far East. According to sources in the U.S. Fleet Reserve in Shanghai, they believe that the issuance of the mobilization order was not unexpected, as the annual physical examinations for naval reservists, which were aimed at classifying reservists by grade, were carried out with unusual strictness this year, and there had already been rumors in Shanghai about the U.S. Navy's intention to call up reservists.

Officials Have No Opinion on This

Furthermore, *The Shanghai Times* reports that regarding the U.S. Navy's call-up of reservists, reporters inquired with a member of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet and conducted investigations. However, the impact of this order from the U.S. Navy Department on U.S. Navy reservists residing in Shanghai or other parts of the Far East remains uncertain. U.S. officials have no firm opinion on this matter. They claim that they have no information other than the telegrams already received here.

Retired Officers and Soldiers Will Also Be Conscripted

It is known that there are quite a few retired officers and soldiers from the U.S. Navy living in Shanghai who receive pensions. It is widely believed that some of them may be called up for service. U.S. naval officers declined to comment on this point. However, it is generally believed that most of these retired naval officers are over the age of military service. Therefore, if the U.S. Navy Department's current call-up of reservists is implemented in Shanghai, the number of retired officers and soldiers who are called up for service will be small. As for the number of American expatriates in Shanghai who belong to other grades of the Naval Reserve who will be called up for service, it is also impossible to know for certain. According to non-official sources, their number will also be quite limited.

### Celebrating the Double Tenth Festival, Promoting Four Major Campaigns: Thrift and Disaster Relief, Raising Funds for Winter Clothing, Implementing National Construction Savings, and National Day Donations

The day after tomorrow is the National Day of the Republic of China. All sectors of the community in Shanghai, all levels of courts, post offices, customs, and various agencies and organizations will hang flags and take a holiday. They will also actively promote four major campaigns: (1) Thrift and disaster relief, (2) Raising funds for winter clothing, (3) National construction savings, and (4) National Day donations. The authorities of the two settlements have decided to jointly implement security measures starting today. In addition to prohibiting illegal gatherings and activities, they will strictly enforce curfew laws, and unnecessary roads will also be closed early (such as Laobeimen Street and Beile Road in the French Concession, which have been closed to traffic since the evening of the day before yesterday before 8:00 PM and will not be reopened until 8:00 AM the next morning). The number of police officers stationed on various roads has also been increased, and search operations have been stepped up. On the one hand, car patrol teams and patrol teams have been dispatched to various districts to conduct searches of pedestrians and vehicles.

### Thrift and National Construction Savings: Forming a Promotion Committee

Savings bonds originated in England. When the previous European war broke out, British economists suggested compulsory savings. However, during that war, the implementation of wartime savings bonds in England was extremely effective. As for compulsory savings, if based on salary grades, disparities between the rich and poor would make fairness difficult to achieve. Therefore, it was not implemented. China's industry has not yet developed to its full extent, and salary standards are narrow in scope. To achieve the popularity of savings, the effect of promoting savings is crucial. The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, have jointly formed the National Thrift and National Construction Savings Promotion Committee to promote thrift savings on a more widespread scale and to be responsible for intensifying promotions. For thrift savings, in addition to the government guaranteeing the safety of principal and interest, they are also specially authorized to exempt income tax on savings interest in order to encourage the people to actively save.

### A Soldier from the Lost Battalion Was Shot Yesterday by a White Russian. Xie Jinyuan Made a Statement Last Night, Bearing Humiliation and Heavy Burdens in Accordance with the Wishes of Chairman Chiang, and that The Soldier Was Shot Unprovoked, and Pedestrians Were Hit by Stray Bullets.

The Lost Battalion on Jiaozhou Road had a conflict with the White Russian merchant guard last month. After several negotiations by He Dequi, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Guo Shun, a satisfactory resolution was reached, and peace had been maintained for more than ten days. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, another incident occurred in which a White Russian guard shot a soldier from the Lost Battalion. A reporter from Dazhong News Agency visited Commander Xie Jinyuan last night, who made a statement. The details are as follows:

Looking Out and Shot Without Reason

At 10:05 AM yesterday, a soldier from the Lost Battalion poked his head out to look over the northwest corner of the compound wall (on Singapore Road). He was spotted by a White Russian guard, who immediately fired a shot at him. The bullet hit him in the left neck, and he collapsed under the wall. A man and an old woman were also hit by stray bullets. After the incident, the police and Renji Hospital were notified by telephone, and ambulances were dispatched to take the wounded to the hospital for treatment. The Gordon Road Police Station also dispatched detectives to rush to the scene to investigate. It is reported that the soldier's name is Ding Guoshun (Sergeant), 29 years old, from Hubei Province. His injuries are not serious and his life is not in danger. The bullet grazed Ding's neck, pierced a man's flank, and entered the old woman's leg. The bullet has not yet been removed. After the incident, the camp maintained its original order and did not cause any disturbance. Security was as usual.

Xie Jinyuan Made a Statement Yesterday

At 8:30 PM last night, a reporter from Dazhong News Agency paid a special visit to Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lost Battalion. According to him, "It is impossible to know what the soldier was trying to do when he poked his head over the wall. According to my speculation, it may be due to the extreme mental suffering he has endured for the past three years. However, it must be solemnly stated that the soldier's actions were purely personal and had nothing to do with the will of the entire Lost Battalion. However, it can be asserted that this action was by no means a capital crime. The White Russian guard's rash shooting, according to the laws of civilized countries, seems to be excessive and regrettable. At a time when the international environment is favorable to China, we, being in a complex situation, will not take any unnecessary actions that may cause any disturbance, nor will we take any humiliating actions that are contrary to the position of Chinese soldiers. Chairman Chiang sent a telegram yesterday instructing me to bear humiliation and heavy burdens in the face of any incident. I will strictly abide by this instruction and carefully deal with everything." Xie said that this incident would not escalate. At this time, the enthusiastic national anthem was sung on the parade ground. Xie and his subordinates stood up to salute, and the reporter also left.

### National Rice Prices Fall, Breaking the 90 Yuan Barrier Yesterday. Low-Priced Rice Sales to End Today

The overall problem of public food is gradually easing these days. Rice prices at various stores are falling, the market is full of spot goods, and public sentiment is finally weakening. Yesterday morning, rice prices at various stores continued to fall, and national rice prices broke the 90 yuan barrier.

Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai

Regarding the source of foreign rice from abroad, few shipments have arrived in Shanghai recently. However, 80,000 bags of Kong rice have been continuously loaded onto French ships and have begun their journey. They are still on their way to Shanghai and are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of this month. All of these shipments were traded some time ago, and the price of each bag is only about 75 or 76 yuan. Once this batch of foreign rice arrives in Shanghai, the market price of rice is expected to plummet. As for foreign rice from Hong Kong, it can also be shipped in batches in a short period of time. Therefore, the food reserves in Shanghai will continue to increase.

Association Orders 6,000 Bags

The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association, located at Room 311, 3rd Floor, Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, accepts entrustments from all walks of life to order foreign rice and enrich Shanghai's food reserves. At a time when rice prices are soaring, the Association's work is even more relevant. It is heard that the Association's purchasing committee, headed by Gui Yanfang, entrusted Shen Ji & Co. on the 25th of this month to order 4,000 bags of Grade 2 Kong rice and another 2,000 bags. Each bag weighs 220 pounds, equivalent to 1 stone and 2 dou and a half, at a price of 79.5 yuan and 80 yuan in legal currency. They will be distributed to the 22nd and 23rd batches of subscribers. The 24th batch has gathered a considerable number of subscribers and will continue to be ordered.

Low-Priced Rice Sales End Today

The sixth phase of low-priced foreign rice sales organized by the Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Sales Committee began on the 19th of last month, and the poor have been very enthusiastic about purchasing it. Sales at 24 rice shops in the French Concession area were temporarily suspended at the end of last month due to the inability to distribute rice because of the police's protection of streetcar traffic. They have not yet resumed. It is learned that, according to regulations, each phase lasts 20 days, which ends today. Sales will be temporarily terminated starting from the 9th. According to a reporter from Daguang News Agency who inquired with the Low-Priced Rice Sales Committee, the Committee has organized six phases of low-priced rice sales, totaling 170,000 bags of foreign rice. As of now, there are still more than 30,000 bags of broken rice left. A meeting will be held to discuss continuing sales until this batch of rice is sold out, and then sales will be terminated.

Fellow Villagers' Group Buys Rice

Daguang News Agency reports that the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association's executive committee, Yan Bo, believes that high rice prices affect the livelihood of the common people and social order. He has sent a letter requesting the Association to organize a fellow villagers' group to purchase rice. The proposed measures are as follows: (1) Organize a special committee for group rice purchases, (2) Stipulate the number of bags purchased in each batch, (3) Use radio stations to broadcast the purpose and detailed measures of the group rice purchase and advertise in newspapers to solicit purchasers, (4) Stipulate the unit of purchase for purchasers (with 5 bags as the unit of purchase) and the deposit to be paid, and (5) Designate a bank to receive deposits.

### Three French Ships to Resume Shanghai-Vietnam Line. Two Ships Carrying 80,000 Bags of Rice Headed for Shanghai. To Sail to Saigon and Haiphong After Arriving in Shanghai

The French Mail Steamship Company's regular mail ship on the Europe-Asia line, *Général Joffre*, and several irregular ships, such as *Yarra*, *Seikiang*, *Kaiteria*, and *Lothian*, suspended their voyages to the Far East due to the expansion of the European war. The *Général Joffre* was docked in Saigon, and the *Yarra* and *Seikiang* irregular ships were rerouted to the Shanghai-Vietnam line. After the Japanese army landed in Haiphong on the 26th of last month, all ships on the Hong Kong-Vietnam and Shanghai-Vietnam lines were suspended. Therefore, the *Yarra*, *Seikiang*, and other French ships also suspended their voyages to Saigon for more than ten days. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, French ships will soon resume the Shanghai-Vietnam line. The French Mail Steamship Company's *Yarra*, *Lothian*, and *Kaiteria* will depart from Saigon within the next few days to Shanghai.

It is expected that the *Yarra* will arrive in Shanghai on the 16th of this month, and the *Lothian* will also arrive in Shanghai on the 17th. The *Kaiteria* will also arrive around the 20th. Once they arrive in Shanghai, they will sail to Saigon and Haiphong on a regular basis. It is also heard that the *Yarra* and *Lothian* are transporting large quantities of foreign rice from Vietnam, as many as 80,000 bags. It is also known that although the Japanese army has entered Vietnam, commerce cannot be interfered with. Therefore, the transport of Vietnamese rice to China is not affected.

### Wife of British Ambassador to Japan Leaves Shanghai for Japan. Had Shopped and Visited Friends in Shanghai. Trip Was Purely for Tourism

The wife of the British Ambassador to Japan, Lady Craigie, arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo on the 1st aboard the NYK Line's *Nitada Maru*. She stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. In addition to shopping for groceries at Whiteway, Laidlaw & Co., Ltd. and hiring a car to visit friends, she stayed indoors for several days and had little contact with the outside world. She quietly left Shanghai by mail ship on the evening before last (6th) and is expected to arrive in Tokyo today. According to the British Embassy in Shanghai, Lady Craigie's trip was purely for private sightseeing and had no special mission. However, the outside world has been paying close attention.

### Rotary Club Weekly Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow

This Thursday's regular meeting of the Rotary Club of Shanghai coincides with the Double Tenth Festival. Therefore, the Shanghai Rotary Club and the dining meeting of clubs from other locations will be held on the eve of the Double Tenth Festival, on Wednesday evening at 7:30 PM (October 9th), on the 3rd floor of the Park Hotel. Dinner will begin at 8:00 PM. However, members who prefer Western food should call the club secretary (16450) to reserve seats. There will be an excellent program at that time.

### Yangtze River Water Level Has Dropped, High-Water Buoys Removed

Previously, the Yangtze River water level in front of the Jianghai Customs was very high. In order to ensure the safety of navigation, high-water buoys were set up at the entrance of the Yangtze River outside Wusongkou to indicate navigation. Now that the river water has receded and the water discharge is no longer as rapid as it was last month, the high-water buoys have been removed and will no longer be lit or marked.

### French Tramway Workers' Strike: Written Negotiations Yesterday. Labor Presented Seven Demands Yesterday Morning. The Capital Also Responded, Negotiations Are Approaching

Striking workers of the French Tramway Company reportedly presented seven demands to the company's General Manager, Favre, in writing yesterday morning. It is said that Favre received the demands and also responded in writing in the afternoon. The conditions negotiated by both parties are as follows:

Labor Demands

(1) The company must recognize the workers' representatives. (2) Wages must be paid as usual during the strike period. (3) The workers arrested by the police must be released. (4) Wages must be increased. (5) Workers must not be dismissed without reason. (6) Temporary workers hired during the strike must be dismissed. (7) Suspended workers must be reinstated.

Capital Response

(1) The company will never recognize representatives who do not have the legal number of members. (2) The company will pay wages as usual and also temporary subsidies from the start of the strike on the 25th of last month to the date of request, the 7th of this month. However, the foreman's bonus will be canceled, and striking workers who have not come to work by the 8th will be treated as resigned. (3) The company agrees that the employed workers will continue working after the police releases those who are deemed innocent. (4) The company will not respond to the wage increase issue, as the wages of all workers in this company are comparable to those of other companies. (5) The company agrees to this and will never dismiss workers without reason. (6) If the striking workers return to work, all temporary workers hired by the company will be dismissed. This will never happen. (7) The company believes that if a suspended worker has made a mistake, they will not be reinstated. If a suspended worker requests reinstatement, they should submit a written request to the company, which will then consider the matter and make a decision. Based on this, the negotiations have shown a glimmer of hope and may be resolved in the coming days.

### Interbank Transfers of 50 Million Yuan: Allocations Soon to Be Exhausted. Widely Used in Shanghai for More Than a Year

In order to adjust the supply of funds for industry and commerce among colleagues in the banking industry, the Bankers Association of Shanghai began handling interbank allocation on July 1, 1939. Since then, various banks and firms have applied to the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee for allocations in accordance with regulations, which have become widely circulated in the Shanghai market and have been well received by Chinese and foreigners alike. The original total allocation amount was 50 million yuan in national currency, which is soon to be exhausted. To avoid misunderstandings regarding the issuance of allocation certificates, it has been decided to

Keep Them in Reserve But Not Use Them

### Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Issues Return-to-Hometown Certificates

Due to the recent interruption of shipping to Shipu, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association intended to stop issuing certificates for fellow villagers returning to their hometown. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, in order to facilitate the return of fellow villagers, the Association is still issuing certificates to members of the Association or fellow villagers with legitimate occupations who must return to their hometown for business purposes, so that they can travel back and forth. At the same time, the Yinxian County Government's office for issuing travel permits has also officially resumed operations and is issuing travel permits as usual. Anyone holding a certificate issued by the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association can exchange it for a travel permit before being allowed to leave for Shanghai.

### Tense Situation in Western Shanghai After Japanese Soldiers Attacked. Japanese Soldiers Patrol and Search Pedestrians. Residents Stay Indoors and Experience False Alarms

Since the shooting of Japanese Army trainee officer Yoshio Imai at 9:50 AM the day before yesterday in front of Xujiahui Catholic Church, the Japanese army has mobilized. In addition to maintaining strict security at the scene of the incident, they have also searched every house, but to no avail. It is learned that the Japanese soldier was patrolling the area on a bicycle in plain clothes when he was suddenly attacked. He was hit in the chest and abdomen and collapsed to the ground in pain. He lost consciousness and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the situation in Xujiahui and the extra-settlement roads in western Shanghai suddenly became tense. Large groups of Japanese military police patrolled and searched pedestrians at any time. In general, residents stayed indoors and experienced false alarms.

### Tiger Car Loaded with Stolen Woolen Cloth. Patrolmen Find Suspicious Circumstances. They Open Fire to Arrest the Criminals and Three Suspects Are Arrested.

At around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, patrolmen No. 083 and No. 1371 from the General Patrol Force were patrolling along Yuanmingyuan Road when they saw six or seven coolies pulling a tiger car loaded with 37 bolts of woolen cloth worth tens of thousands of yuan. Because the circumstances were suspicious, they stepped forward to investigate. Unexpectedly, these people tried to escape. Because the patrolmen were outnumbered, No. 1371 had no choice but to fire two warning shots. One bullet hit another passerby, Peng Qisheng, in the arm. As a result, Mao Rengen, Wang Youcai, and Wang Ruxi were arrested and brought back to the police station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Peng Bingsheng, it was learned that the woolen cloth was stolen from the office of Russian merchant Kao Qidaofu (transliteration), located at No. 97 Yuanmingyuan Road. They planned to sell it to woolen cloth brokers Zhu Guoliang, who resided in Room 315 of the Yangtze Hotel. Detectives went to the room and arrested Zhu Guoliang, as well as Yuan Lide, Zhou Shengrong, Xiang Jin, Zhou Mingyang, and others who lived in the same room. They were transferred to the Criminal Court One of the Special Court One yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested that the hearing be postponed because the case still required the arrest of accomplices and investigation of the case. After questioning by Judge Feng, he ordered them to be held for a further hearing.

### Former Dancer Chen Meilin Arrested for Stealing a Watch

Chen Meilin, a local who used to be a dancer at the Cathay Dance Hall, is 21 years old. After quitting dancing, she lived with her lover in the Da Yigong Apartment on Luban Road in the French Concession. Wang Guiying, who currently dances at the Yunshang Dance Hall and lives at No. 66 Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road, is a sister in the same profession as Chen Meilin and often visits her. One afternoon, Chen went to Wang's house to play. She seized the opportunity to steal a watch worth 30 yuan. She was discovered by Wang, who called guard No. 1038 and Chinese Detective Sun Guihua to come and arrest Chen, together with the stolen goods, and take her to the Xinzha Police Station. She was transferred to the Criminal Court Eight of the Special Court One yesterday morning. Police lawyer Fang Fushu prosecuted her according to law. Chen Meilin admitted to temporarily borrowing the watch from Wang, but denied stealing it. Judge Fang sentenced Chen Meilin to 50 days of detention for theft, and the stolen goods were returned.

### Tongfengyong Gold Shop Owner Xu Busun Kidnapped Yesterday; Abducted by Bandits on the Way to the Shop; Both Man and Car Missing; Police Searching with No Trace

Yesterday afternoon around 1 PM, another kidnapping case occurred in the Public Concession. The kidnapped victim was Xu Busun, a gold shop owner from Suzhou. The details of the case are as follows:

Opening a Gold Shop

Xu Busun, from Wu County, is 60 years old and resides at No. 5 and 7, Lane 106, Maitehesi Road in Shanghai. He owns Tongfengyong Gold Shop at No. 310 Nanjing Road. He has one wife and one concubine. Although Xu is already elderly, he still goes to the shop to work every day, so he owns a No. 1560 car for transportation, and employs Chen Shunfa as the driver.

Encountering Bandits En Route

Yesterday afternoon around 1 PM, Xu ordered the driver to bring the car out and boarded it to go to work. He was traveling west to east. When he reached Muer Ming Road, four bandits suddenly appeared. Three of them, armed with pistols, blocked the car's path. They jumped into the car, threatened him with guns, forced the driver Chen Shunfa out, and drove the car south to an unknown location.

Pursuit Without Results

After the incident, the driver Chen Shunfa rushed home to inform Xu's family, who reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Upon receiving the information, the police dispatched police cars full of Chinese and foreign detectives to track down and arrest the bandits. However, the bandits, the car, and the people were all gone. The police notified all district police stations and the French Concession police to pay close attention to the car, but so far there is still no trace of the people or the car.

### Social News

Huang Jinbiao, a poor man from Jiangbei, 37 years old, lives by scavenging garbage in an empty house at No. 44, Xieqiao Road, Nanshi. Yesterday morning around 10 AM, he picked up a pile of pufferfish roe in a garbage bin at the Jumen Road intersection. He took it home, cooked it, and ate it with his meal. Unexpectedly, after eating it, he suffered severe abdominal pain and was barely breathing. He was taken to the hospital by someone for treatment.

Yesterday morning around 6 AM, three thieves suddenly came to Zhenda Xiang Cloth Shop at No. 1225, Haige Road, Xujiahui in the French Concession. They held a pistol and broke in, stealing more than 8,000 yuan in cash before fleeing. Afterwards, the shop reported the case to the French Concession police for investigation and arrest.

### Compound Organ Preparation: Ginseng Velvet Spermin - Developed by Pharmacist He Zikang

Since the German physiologist Browu Sequard extracted testicular hormone and named it Spermin, endocrine preparations have been applied in the treatment field. Afterwards, the number of researchers increased day by day. In the past fifty years, other endocrine hormones have been invented continuously, and the most effective is testicular hormone, that is, Spermin. But we cannot ignore the fact that we praise Spermin, but put other hormones related to development, reproduction and maintenance of health behind our minds, such as the pituitary gland's control of development, ovarian follicles' relationship with menstruation and female development, and deer antler's nourishment of the human body. Each has its own effect, but various endocrine hormones are also interrelated. Only by shortening the length and supplementing the weaknesses can great effects be shown. Therefore, modern drug manufacturers often make medicines with multiple hormones to treat diseases. However, multiple components, such as the crystalline hormone of testicles, deer antler, etc., are very difficult to refine. If the immersion cream preparation method is used, the efficacy will be weak. Therefore, it is difficult for those without extensive experience to be effective, especially for compound organ preparations. It is necessary to ensure that each component does not lose its inherent efficacy. Mr. He Zikang, a Chinese pharmaceutical expert, is the earliest Chinese researcher of organ preparations. Mr. He has been researching endocrine preparations for more than ten years and has already made products for the benefit of society. Now, based on his experience, based on the theory of endocrinology, he has further developed compound wax organ preparations. The ingredients are extracted from ginseng, deer antler, testicles, placenta, ovarian follicles, and liver to refine effective crystalline bodies, and added vitamins B and D. It is named "Ginseng Velvet Spermin" Sunmoon Spermin, which is divided into injection and tablet forms. It is the most perfect of modern compound organ preparations. He's self-created Jixing Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory has perfect scientific equipment and is exquisite and superior.

### Prostitute Abandoned; Sues to Confirm Daughter and Seeks 1,500 Yuan for Living Expenses; Postponed for Further Hearing Due to the Need to Summon Witnesses

Xi Meimei, a woman from Suzhou, 24 years old, runs her business in a brothel at No. 3, Fuyu Lane, Guangxi Road. In 1937, Zhang Zuwang, a local manager of the Heyuan Sugar Shop at No. 19, Fujian Road, invited guests to the brothel. Seeing that Xi Meimei's appearance was not bad, he falsely claimed that his wife had passed away and proposed to

marry her.

Xi was temporarily lured by sweet words and rented a house with him to cohabit. It has been four years since then, and the two have been happy. On January 25 of this year, Meimei gave birth to a daughter named Bao Bao at Guangren Hospital on Avenue Edward VII. Now she is pregnant again. However, the course of love is full of changes. In the barren months of this year, a person surnamed Li suddenly came to Xi's place and said, "Your affair with Zhang Zuwang has been discovered by his wife. Quickly break up with Mr. Zhang, otherwise I am afraid it will be unfavorable to you. Money can be discussed." Xi at that time

was skeptical.

At that time, Zhang had not come to her place for several days. At first, she thought Zhang was busy with business, so she did not suspect anything else. Now that Li had stated the situation, she began to investigate. Soon, she met Zhang's wife at Heyuan Sugar Shop. Her attitude was fierce and unreasonable. Xi asked to see Zhang one last time, but it was impossible. She realized that Zhang already had the intention of abandoning her and she could not reverse it. Repeated negotiations on settlement arrangements also yielded no results. Xi Meimei then hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to represent her and submitted a petition to the Civil Court of the Special Court, in the capacity of a legal representative, on behalf of her daughter Bao Bao against Zhang Zuwang, seeking

confirmation of the birth of a daughter

and payment of 1,500 yuan for five months of living expenses. Based on the petition, the court was heard yesterday morning in the seventh civil court by Judge Tan Hao. First, the plaintiff stated the intention of the lawsuit, and said that the defendant had assets of hundreds of thousands of yuan and had sugar shops all over Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, and Wuhu, so it was a drop in the ocean for him to bear a monthly living expense of 300 yuan. The defendant was absent, and lawyers Yu Bingwen and Li Baosen appeared in court as agents. They believed that Bao Bao was born to the defendant, and

requested that the lawsuit be rejected.

At this point, the plaintiff presented second landlord Mi Luqing, maid Qian Xiashi, and wet nurse Chuan Zhangshi to testify in court, stating that the house at No. 3, Fuyu Lane was rented by Zhang, and the wages of the maid and others were paid by Zhang. The court verified the words, because Zhang himself and the nurses of Guangren Hospital needed to be summoned to testify, so the hearing was postponed to the 14th for further hearing.

### Children's Welfare Association Launches a Charity Painting Auction; Sends Letters Soliciting Famous Works; For Tuition Fees for Newspaper Boys, Etc.

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association is a purely charitable organization dedicated to children's welfare. It has carried out relief work for many years and has won the sympathy and support of people from all walks of life. Recently, the association has been painstakingly planning and diligently executing the project of education for newspaper boys and care for beggar children, which is truly admirable. It is reported that the painting exhibition committee of the association, along with Ya Chen, Li Qiujun, Ma Gongyu, Xie Haiyan, Xie Gongzhan, Yan Wenliang, etc., have launched a project to solicit 1,000 paintings and calligraphy works from all walks of life for a charity sale. All proceeds will be used for the association's expenses. The association needs more than 1,000 yuan per month for expenses, which used to come from donations from all walks of life. It is now planned to gradually expand so that all the suffering children in Shanghai can escape the fire and water and be able to sit on the mat. Not only will those who are directly affected benefit greatly, but the entire society will also benefit greatly. However, due to the soaring prices in recent years, the increase in expenditure has had a great impact on the association. All uses have been difficult to manage. They have no choice but to call for Bo, hoping that famous artists will give their great works to raise funds for charity sales. People with the same heart will definitely give assistance. If you would like to contribute, please send it to Room 414, 4th Floor, No. 169 Yuanmingyuan Road. The current situation of the association is described as follows:

(1) The association believes that most of the newspaper boys in Shanghai come from poor families. Driven by life, they sell newspapers along the road in wind and rain. They lose their education at a young age, which is very pitiful. Therefore, four newspaper boys' education classes have been established to accommodate more than 230 newspaper boys, providing them with courses to increase their knowledge so that they can find better jobs in the future.

(2) Most of the homeless beggar children in Shanghai are orphans without parents. No one feeds them and they are allowed to drift around, begging in the streets in the morning and sleeping in the alleys at night. The suffering of their lives is hard to describe. The association now has a center on Bailinan Road to accommodate more than 80 beggar children. In addition to providing clothing, food, accommodation, and education, specialized technicians are hired to teach them work skills so that they will not be unable to make a living when they grow up.

After 2:30 PM, it briefly rose to 3 pence 6875 and 5 yuan 75. In the end, the closing price was 3 pence 65625 and 5 yuan 71875, which was 0.09375 and 0.1875 lower than the previous weekend.

In the afternoon, Chase also sold November US dollar futures to fellow banks at 5 yuan 65625. The market closed at 3 pence 640625 for British gold and 5 yuan 65625 for US dollars.

The Whole Day Was in a Loose State

The market remained loose in the afternoon. The opening price was 3 pence 671875 for British gold and 5 yuan 6875 for US dollars. After speculators and Hong Kong Electric sold, it became even looser. Spot US dollars were sold to foreign banks at 5 yuan 71875. A certain bank also sold October US dollar futures to HSBC and Yuli at 5 yuan 75. Additionally, Chinese banks also sold October US dollars to foreign firms at 5 yuan 78125. At that time, the current premium rose to 3 pence 6875, while the US dollar fell to 5 yuan 75.

### Speculative Selling Reached Its Peak, Cash Rapidly Declined, Reaching a Low of 5,635 Yuan

Yesterday, the spot gold unofficial market plummeted rapidly, mainly because the United States hardened its attitude and was willing to go to war with the Axis powers. Moreover, the exchange market tended to harden, and operators had a strong psychology of short selling. The short positions accounted for eight or nine out of ten. In addition, the floating long positions emerged from time to time, and the market price became smaller and smaller. At one point in the afternoon, the latest low price of 5,635 yuan appeared. Then, some psychological changes occurred slightly, and some took advantage of the low price to profit and cover short positions, and new long positions also became active, so the evening closing price rebounded to 5,705 yuan. As a result, it fell by 125 yuan compared with last weekend, and the total transaction volume was 4,000 taels. Gold ornaments in gold shops were finally marked down by 10 yuan, and customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Fell Sharply by a Hundred Yuan

At the beginning of the morning, the exchange market reported hard, and sellers competed to sell, and the opening price immediately fell into the 5,800 yuan mark. Then the securities firms exited at 50 yuan, lower than 5,790 yuan, which was 40 yuan lower than Saturday. Then, due to the loosening of foreign exchange, securities firms and cash firms competed to sell, and soon fell another 55 yuan, falling to 5,735 yuan. Then, relying on the help of silver shops and retail investors, it once rebounded to 5,775 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange industry and securities firms took the opportunity to sell short and increase their positions, and finally went down again. When it fell within 5,730 yuan, there were fewer buyers, and the sellers surged even more. At 11:30, it had fallen to 5,685 yuan. The price rebounded by 15 yuan before closing, but the closing price was only 5,690 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was immediately 10 yuan lower, falling to 5,680 yuan. Then it fell again to 5,670 yuan. Later, because the securities firms suddenly covered their short positions, it once rebounded to 5,700 yuan. However, because the silver shops and gold shops successively sold in the future, and there was a lack of maintenance in the market, the latest low price of 5,635 yuan was created. Later, the securities firms came again to cover their short positions, and the market situation stabilized. Soon, relying on the new long positions of the silver shops to pull up, it rebounded to the 5,700 yuan mark, rising to 5,715 yuan. Unexpectedly, the selling trend rose again at that time, and the money exchange industry mostly sold out, and it fell again to 5,680 yuan. Fortunately, the silver shops and securities firms still had a strong appetite, and they returned to the 5,700 yuan mark outside the market. The closing price was 5,705 yuan. As a result, it fell by 125 yuan compared with last weekend, and the price fluctuated by 155 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash firms' standard gold was several yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Ornaments Gold Finally Marked Down by Ten Yuan

The exchange price of gold ornaments per tael was unchanged at the beginning. It was marked down by 10 yuan at about 11:00, and then down by 10 yuan again at about 2:00 pm. At 4:00 pm in the evening, it rebounded by 10 yuan. As a result, Da Tong Bank changed to 590 yuan, and the new banks' price was similar to the previous price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Weakened

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation was that the various news about domestic and foreign affairs rumored in the market were all favorable to the sellers, so the spot gold fell sharply and the foreign exchange weakened. Therefore, people's hearts were restored to emptiness, and the supply from all parties was extremely abundant. The British and American gold pounds finally fell by three yuan, and the British gold notes were still stable at the beginning, and finally fell by one yuan. The American gold notes fell by four corners and three points, and the supply of Hong Kong notes was endless, and the price fell by nine points. Singapore, Robi, Canada, Philippines and other notes were not short of sellers, and the market price fell by one corner unanimously. There was a slight turnaround in Japanese gold notes, and the market price rebounded by one point, and the evening market rose to one yuan, four corners and five points. The supply and demand of Korean notes were even, and the market price stood firm. The evening market was still one yuan, one corner and four points.

### Yarn and Cotton Weaving, Limited Actual Sales, Unstable Yarn Prices, The Market With Large Fluctuations Was Created by Speculation

The yarn market, which had risen sharply last week, turned into an up-and-down situation yesterday. This situation was entirely caused by speculative enthusiasm. However, people's hearts generally looked up, but foreign exchange rose sharply, and gold fell sharply, so that the floating long positions were unstable, and the general hat-snatching generation gathered in the market, specializing in embracing the trend of power, so it rose again and again, and fell even more. As for the actual situation, except for the Hong Kong gang who had a slight need, the others were silent as usual. Today, 1,615 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.

In the morning, the current yarn market opened, and the market atmosphere was still tense. The twenty-count Double Horse head market opened at 1,190 yuan, opening a parallel market. As soon as this price opened, the buying sound was thunderous, and the sellers did not dare to shout. It went straight to the peak of 1,216 to 7 yuan. Seeing that foreign exchange was released and the gold price fell, at the same time, it was rumored that the Lanfeng standard yarn had stopped the board, and for a while, the wind and the crane were roaring, and people were panicked. It was also disturbing, and in a flash it fell to 1,165 yuan. At this time, it was nearly 11 o'clock, and the floating short positions came up to fill, and it rose back one step, and closed at 1,175 yuan, and then 10 yuan less. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 5,885 bales. The amount of purchase by each gang is listed on the left,

### Cotton Buying and Selling, Mostly by Fellow Traders

The current cotton situation is worse than last weekend. This is because the yarn price has fallen, and the foreign exchange has grown sharply, resulting in scattered people's hearts and sluggish factory needs. However, mutual buying and selling among peers and football transactions are still considered not bad. Today, 630 bales of cotton were transported to Hong Kong.

In other news, the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, the market situation is quite active. Later, due to the good spot transactions and the purchase of overseas cotton merchants, the closing price was three to five pounds higher than the previous day. India's forecast rose by more than one rupee yesterday.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have become increasingly active recently. The cotton price has not become cheaper due to the loose rise of the exchange rate, but has risen step by step. Compared with the selling price last week, it has risen by four to five yuan or more. Traders even have the pain of not being able to buy foreign cotton. The general mindset is extremely strong, so it is expected that raw cotton will still rise in the near future.

### Grain, Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Can Arrive, Yesterday's Market Original Package Has Fallen Sharply, Newly Harvested Rice Arrivals Are Also Strong

Foreign rice is coming in continuously. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (June 6th), loaded with 600 bags from Hong Kong. The Yuezhou Wheel also arrived at the port on June 6th, carrying 4,546 bags from Hong Kong. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel also carried 622 bags from Hong Kong, and the Jardine Matheson's Fusheng Wheel also carried 1,500 bags from Hong Kong. They have been unloaded separately yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Wheel loaded with 7,059 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, as listed in the previous Japanese column. The Taiyuan series of Yingzhou Wheels loaded with 7,939 bags of private foreign rice, and this is corrected. (Zu)

The foreign rice market opened early in the morning, and the real sales shops were very sluggish due to the continuous price decline. Yesterday, the market price was flat and there were slight inquiries, so the high-priced foreign rice was seen to be tight, and the large merchants were also reluctant to sell. The market seemed to be stabilized. Then, due to the further loosening of foreign exchange, the pricing of foreign rice was lowered again, and the fixed cargo has already opened with 9,000 tons of French wheels. The Hong Kong-loaded cargo is expected to arrive soon, and the new Jingjian at the end of Dumi also arrived in an endless stream, so the hearts of the people were unanimous down. In the morning, it changed from firm to tired, and stood small at three corners of the wilderness. In the afternoon, it was cut by five or six corners. The original package of Yinghua Sima, which was returned, was even weaker. The Bank No. 2 Saigon, which opened at 82 yuan last week, fell to 79 yuan yesterday. The foreign warehouse goods fell to 77 and a half yuan in the afternoon, both of which saw a fall of about three yuan. The current foreign rice also dropped by one yuan on the whole day yesterday. No. 1 Saigon 71.2 yuan to 70 yuan, No. 2 66.7 yuan to 65.5 yuan, Small twist 63.4 yuan, Siamese No. 2 64.5 yuan to 63 yuan, Fire grain high 72.5 yuan to 72 yuan, The big city 70.5 yuan to 68.5 yuan, Rice tea 56.7 yuan,

Thick and thin broken rice has become a lost-order cicada. The stock is about to run out, and it is rarely seen on the market, and the asking price also lacks a certain standard. Only the early rice of Nanhang is sold for 80 yuan.

More than 2,000 stones of new Jingjian Heshang and pedal-powered rice are continuously transported, of which Yangjian is the most, and Jingmi and Dujian are limited, and the kiln species are mostly goods from the Xitang area, which are soft and cannot be stored for a long time, so the kiln species has a unique loose sales intention, and the guest stomach is also scattered, resulting in a sharp drop of two or three yuan, opening from 82 yuan to 79 yuan. The new Jing has a wide range of destinations, increasing by one yuan instead, especially 80 yuan, Zhongguan 77 yuan, Yangjian Pingping 64 yuan, leather 62 yuan, Dujian goods fresh stomach fragrance and rise one or two yuan, high from 69 yuan to 66 yuan. Glutinous rice, both domestic and foreign goods, is flat in the sales market, and the cargo owners have no intention of selling urgently, and there is no change. They still open Jin Li Special Yuan 72 yuan, Chang Dan 71 yuan 70 yuan, Hong Kong Yuan 71.2 yuan, and then to about 70 yuan.

### Flour and Wheat Rise Secretly, Also Due to the Impedance of Arrivals

Flour trading is not prosperous, and the situation is quite tight. This is because the current flour is becoming more and more scarce, and the factories are not willing to increase production for a while, so the retail in this street mostly lacks goods, and the covert sale is as high as 19 yuan per bag. Yesterday, the return goods of old Che Fen opened more than three cars, and the price reached 18 yuan and 50 cents, which was equal to the guest market, so the retail price was so high. It is also heard that foreign flour is out of stock due to the failure of fixed goods to arrive, and most of them are holding on, and the price is also rising by two or three secretly. The market is still advancing.

Yesterday's source of wheat was quite scarce, because the transportation on the way has been hindered by a certain party, and the factories have limited the price for purchase, and the vendors are watching each other, and the stock is also gradually thin. The holders are holding on to each other. It is heard that the asking price for goods sent to the concession is 27 yuan, but no formal transaction has been made. The scattered shipment to the factory is still priced according to the original market.

### Securities, Domestic Debt Market Softened, Foreign Stocks Sold Short in Droves

The securities unofficial market fell yesterday due to the exit of the long position, but because there were many who covered the short position when it was small, the closing price was still slightly better. However, the two types of B and E once saw new high prices in the morning. Because the C type lottery is approaching, the general people who are unwilling to see the lottery sell out in large numbers to exchange for other debts. The D type has been extremely firm these days. The market price of type E is not much different from that of type C, which is the proof of the exit of C and the entry of D or E. China is currently in an environment of invincibility. Now there is even talk of the United States blocking the Pacific Ocean, and the situation is becoming more and more favorable. The debt market itself should still be optimistic. Yesterday morning, it opened very firmly, and Type C rose to 9 yuan and 40 cents. Later, Lianyi Yitai Defu Xinchang and other long positions came out, and then fell back by three to five corners. Type B once saw a new high price of 61 yuan and 20 cents, and Type E once saw a new high price of 59 yuan. The situation of the long positions surging and selling was suddenly poor. In the afternoon, retail investors sold the most. No. 25 sold out in large numbers. Runde Xinchang Xinfu also sold out, but Lianyi has already returned to do more. Jiufeng Yiji Tongkang Tongshun Renchang and Hongda are all absorbing, and then three or four corners less, so the result is a consistent continuous fall of one and a half corners to six and a half corners. The total number of transactions totaled about 2 million yuan. Here is a brief table of the opening of the stock market by the public yesterday, as generally expected, the trend is unusually soft. Later, people's hearts became more and more empty, and the price became softer and softer, finally causing a fierce fall. The momentum was turbulent, and there was a general sense of uncontrollability. On the one hand, the long positions thought about retaining a part of their "residual profits" and reducing their holdings. On the other hand, the short sellers fueled the flames and tried their best to dump. The market situation wanted it not to fall, and it was difficult to worry about it. The closing potential is still extremely soft. The reasons for the decline in each stock are due to various "bad news" for half, and due to the public's psychological fear for the other half. However, according to the current situation, the prosperous period of many weeks has temporarily become a thing of the past, and the market situation seems to have turned to the other side again.

### Oil Cake, Oil Market Waves Are Huge, The Market Rises and Falls Greatly

Yesterday morning's oil market, due to the strong short side and rumors unfavorable to the long side, the general hoarding households sought to exit in large numbers, and the falling wind was violent for a time (the rise and fall of soybean oil was still limited). The market situation was chaotic, and at its most tired, soybean oil had dropped by two or three yuan, and raw oil had plummeted by five or six yuan, but in an instant there was a rumor that Qingdao had stopped new buying and selling. As a result, it rose again by one or two yuan. In short, speculation was rampant, reversing clouds and rain, and the waves were huge, which made the public suffer. A total of 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil were traded, and the price was 81 yuan and 50 cents. There were 600 dan of Dayouyu Factory soybean oil, and the price was 92 yuan to 93 yuan. There were 700 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, and the price was 84 yuan to 79 yuan and 50 cents. More than 4,000 pieces were delivered in the lower part of October, and the price fell from 85 yuan and 50 cents to 79 yuan and 50 cents, and rose again to 81 yuan and 50 cents. At the closing, 250 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded, and the price was 107 yuan and 50 cents to 107 yuan. 100 barrels were delivered in the upper part of October, and the price was 110 yuan to 107 yuan and 50 cents. 100 barrels were called in the lower part of October, and the price was 112 yuan to 110 yuan. Yesterday, 600 cans of raw oil came from Yan, and today (June 8) 910 bags of sesame and 200 cans of sesame oil will be transported to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods, Yarn Prices Plunged, Cotton Cloth Fell Back

Domestic Cloth The market was scattered yesterday, and the selling market fell back. This was because after the prices had been raised high for days, the current sales turned into a clear state, and the people who sold for profit gradually increased, and the foreign exchange was frequently loose, and the market could not be held. Each piece of cloth fell back by 25 cents to 50 cents, and the current sales only had scattered small amounts. There were more than 300 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth and flannel traded in this street, more than 100 pieces of blue cloth and colored twill traded by the Guangdong and Hong Kong representatives, more than 200 pieces of broadcloth, flannel and coarse cloth traded by the Yantai Weihaiwei representatives of the Northern Route, and the factories only opened small amounts of goods, with a slight decoration.

East Cloth Yesterday, due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, people's hearts were empty and timid, and speculative retail investors rushed to sell, and the falling wind was violent. The leading fine cloth once fell to 35 yuan, 80 cents and 90 cents, but the industry's thoughts were still stable, and the closing price rose back to 36 yuan and 25 cents. There were still transactions after the closing, and it opened at 36 yuan and 30 cents, which was about 1 yuan lower per piece than the market price last week, the fine twill fell by 50 cents to 70 cents, and the broadcloth fell by 4 cents per yard to 1 yuan and 7 and a half cents.

Export There are 1,585 pieces of piece goods to be transported to Hong Kong today.

### Seafood, Yantai Tails Continue to Arrive

Domestically produced shrimp tails. Yesterday, 20 boxes of Yantai Golden Hooks arrived and were sold immediately. The negotiated price was 390 yuan to 392 yuan. It was found that the quality of the goods was worse than before, so the price was also slightly cheaper.

### Miscellaneous: Firewood Also "Controlled"

Although the firewood market had very few goods arriving the previous week, it was still supported by chestnut and pine firewood coming from the occupied areas. Recently, the goods coming from that route have been intercepted by a certain military department, which prohibits their shipment. The firewood stored in this port is becoming increasingly scarce, causing concerns about the inability to cook due to lack of fuel. Naturally, the prices charged by businesses in the same industry have risen. Large-sized, bleached firewood is now one and a half yuan per bundle, "Chuanshan" firewood is about 75 cents per bundle, and small "Taiwan" firewood is three and a half bundles per yuan. Delivery from the warehouse requires an additional fee, and additional charges for hand-carrying.

### Starting from "My Wife"

-- Ren Zhang

Even today, China has not escaped the social ideology of "valuing men over women." That is to say, China still maintains a male-centered society. As everyone knows, people generally refer to their husbands as "outer ones" and their wives as "inner ones." From this, we can draw the following conclusion: men can participate in activities in all sectors of society without restriction, while women can only do things in the small world of the family.

Thus, for thousands of years, such a situation has been created: women have lost their personal independence, and have become attached to men like slaves belonging to masters and cattle belonging to farmers. She relies on men to live, and her fate changes with the changes in men's fates.

Who decided this? It's society! On what grounds does society order women to become "inner ones"?

The fact is, after all, a fact. It is not that women are "unable to bear the burden," but that society subjectively believes they are "too weak to withstand the wind." On the other hand, it is also because women's social status is restricted, which significantly affects women's physical and intellectual development and progress. However, even under such social resistance, we can still discover women's abilities in various aspects: Hua Mulan and Qin Liangyu charged and fell into battle; Wu Zetian (regardless of her good or bad) could also rule China like other men; and since the Republic of China, many female politicians have emerged. Recently, women have participated in work in the rear; and if about half of the women were not participating in the Northwest Highway, I am afraid it would still be difficult to open to traffic.

Therefore, the conclusion is very clear: if we admit that women are also human beings, then we should unconditionally respect their independence, because everyone has their own meaning and value for survival. On the other hand, if society can give women the opportunity to participate in activities, then women may not keep up with men at first, but in the long process, progress is predictable. As for women having to give birth and raise children, this is just a technical issue, because as the number of women participating in social work gradually increases, nurseries, infant homes, and kindergartens will also increase universally.

A great Westerner once said, "Without them, our cause cannot succeed." I send a message to my fellow men and women, rise up, rise up!

Musings

### Not a Love Letter

-- Wan Jiachun

Ke:

You must find my crooked handwriting, like the steps of a drunken wanderer, unfamiliar, right?

When I look at the passing clouds in the blue sky, I think of a distant friend. She is like a ray of sunset, shining on the clouds, creating beautiful霞彩, which is very hot to look at, but what you touch is a gust of evening breeze. How can I not turn around and think of my loving mother, who would add a cold coat to my heart!

Autumn wind sweeps the fallen leaves again, reminding me that it has been a year since we met. The autumn sun in the French Park shone on your new black-and-white-spotted jacket, and a sense of elegance and洒之is deeply imprinted in my mind.

Being in an adverse environment, yet shouldering the dark gate and looking forward to the bright future, is precisely your excellent quality. However, there are also shortcomings, just like everything you pointed out yourself. Overcome them, of course, you have to be a little more calm and your understanding has to be clearer.

A chance encounter brought me and some buddies together on the ancient soil. Some of them are the sons of capitalists, and some are the daughters of millionaires. Their parents do not lack the usual so-called "love," and want to keep them in a greenhouse without experiencing any wind, frost, rain, or snow. However, however, they abandoned their comfortable lives and went to the barren soil to shed their hard-earned blood and sweat. Oh, my friend, this is indeed a miracle, but how real it is!

History is cruel. It does not care about the sadness of parents, it ignores the person-seeking advertisements on newspapers with tears soaking the back of the paper, and it does not care about the tightly knit brows of young people. The chariot of the old man of history carries batches of outstanding young people into the arms of the motherland. However, can the gestation and birth of a new and fortunate society be exchanged for mere partings and sorrows? More sacrifices must be paid!

I heard that Yun is already working. I don’t know how he is doing recently? He calls himself a "goody two-shoes," which I greatly dislike. Because a "goody two-shoes" will never hate evil like an enemy. At best, he can only be good to himself. However, there will never be a "moderate" person in the world who neither does evil nor fights against evil forces. In such a society, the result of being a goody two-shoes is often still to become an accomplice of the evildoer!

Shanghai has become an isolated island. Not only are the houses overcrowded, and the roads are filled with pedestrians, but even the "channels of speech" are narrow. Let's stop here.

I wish you health! Chun

In the journey of life, in the river of life, there should be occasional ripples, waves, even a storm in the dark day; otherwise I would be too lonely, the little boat of my fragile life may be swallowed by a huge wave, or smashed to pieces; but do not be afraid, I must hold my helm steady and fight against this storm! In the arduous struggle, I can temper my will; in the perilous battle, I can show the perseverance of human beings; and, I want to see the beautiful and calm surface of the river after the storm has passed.

### Editor's Note

Regarding the question of "Where should women go?", we have received many articles from readers in recent days, especially from female readers, expressing their opinions, which makes us feel very honored. What particularly moves us is that many readers are "first-time contributors." Most of them express their opinions based on their personal experiences in real life. Although they cannot be said to be completely correct, they are very representative of the views of women in general at present. Regarding the manuscripts discussing the question of "Is this a sacrifice?", if any readers still want to express their opinions, we hope that they can send their manuscripts within three days. We plan to collect all the noteworthy opinions and publish a small special issue or special edition to conclude the discussion.

Next time, we plan to publish Ms. Jiang Yihui's "Our Road" first. We hereby announce this in advance.

Hawthorne Detective Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

-- Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 9 Amazing News

When Yu Gantang said these last few words, he unintentionally showed a fierce expression, like a warrior on the battlefield, preparing to fight the enemy hand-to-hand. Hawthorne stared at him, and the smile on the corner of his mouth gradually disappeared and became very serious. I took advantage of his silence and couldn't help but directly scold this dissipated young man.

I said coldly: "What a irreconcilable! What courage! Do you know what era this is? What mission are you carrying? If you use this courage to respond to all the difficult knowledge, the welfare of the people, and all the difficult problems on the journey of life, then I cannot help but pay you my respects. Now think about it, what are you using your courage for? This is just a simple—not even talking about love—pornographic issue, but you are ignoring life, reputation, parents, and the country, and preparing to risk your life to commit suicide and murder!" I myself felt that these words were a bit excessive, but it was really due to "being unable to restrain myself."

Although Hawthorne did not speak, he sighed deeply, clearly expressing sympathy for my interjection.

The young man's "fierce expression" instantly turned into "fearful expression." He no longer had the courage to look at me, and his voice trembled severely when he answered. Mr. I now know that this is wrong. Otherwise, I would not have come to see you. But I really didn't kill anyone. Mr. Hawthorne, do you believe me after all?

Hawthorne neither accepted nor denied it, and continued to say: "Keep talking. Your own actions last night have not been explained clearly."

Yu Gantang replied: "Okay, I'll tell you. Last night, I accompanied a classmate to see a movie at the Jindou Theater. After it was over, we ate some snacks. I escorted her back——"

"Her? Is it a female classmate?—Alas, you are really busy! Okay, keep talking."

"We hired a car and passed by the gate of Lizha's house. I saw Zhao Boxiong, crouching outside the short wall outside the gate."

Hawthorne suddenly cut him off and said: "You saw him?—What time was that?"

Yu Gantang hesitated slightly and replied: "Probably around twelve o'clock. Because the movie theater was over before half past eleven. Eating snacks didn't take more than half an hour.

Hawthorne nodded. "Okay, tell me in more detail. You definitely saw Zhao Boxiong, there's no mistake?" (130)

### The Civet Cat Harms the Hibiscus Grass (Part 1)

-- New Sound

Bad Luck Ends and Good Luck Begins

One year, probably in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Xiao Mengqi was performing at the Old Tianchan Stage on Er Ma Road. The play was "Eight Searches of Zou Yinglong," and it was quite popular. At the same time, the lead actor on stage was Furongcao, who is now very popular. On the day he went on stage, there were no dramas for him to perform, so he only played a not-very-important Zou Madam in the play "Eight Searches of Zou Yinglong." Although his position was not important, his performance was very wonderful. At the end, when Zou Yinglong was about to escape into the water prison, Furongcao's performance was even more enthusiastic, vivid, and colorful. At the time, I saw this play and recognized Furongcao as a good actor with artistic talent, who would definitely become popular in the future. Who knew that later, the Tianchan Stage changed its style and used the newly compiled play "Civet Cat Exchanging Prince" as its slogan. This time, Furongcao was ruined alive. Needless to say, the main roles in the play "Civet Cat Exchanging Prince" were of course Chang Chunheng first, Liu Xiaoheng second, followed by Meng Hongmao's Prince Anle, Liu Yuqin's Consort Li, and Liu Songting's Guo Huai. Furongcao's Empress Liu, the West Palace Concubine, could only be considered the sixth-ranked Jinshi. Such a good material, even Liu Xiaoheng and Liu Yuqin couldn't compare to him, wouldn't that be wronged people to death? Moreover, the Empress Liu played by Furongcao was a bad seed in the play. The audience had a bad impression of Empress Liu, especially the ignorant women and children. At that time, several of my relatives were Civet Cat fans. When they came back from watching the play, they always said that Furongcao was not good. In fact, it was Empress Liu who was not good. How could Furongcao be bad? But for this reason, Furongcao's reputation gradually declined. Civet Cat! It really harmed Furongcao miserably.

When Chang Chunheng left Tianchan, the role of Bao Gong was replaced by Xiao Mengqi, and the popularity of Civet Cat gradually declined. By the twenty-third book, it had become the end of its rope, and it soon stopped performing. The Civet Cat's bad luck arrived, and Furongcao has since had good luck. How many women are on the road to self-destruction. As the playwright said: If women are not weak-willed, men will not be able to seduce them. According to reports, Miss Shangguan Yunzhu was abandoned by the United Nations for her love of vanity. Now that Miss Shangguan Yunzhu is personally starring in this play, is she also moved by it?

### Feng Gengguang Talks About "Mei Lanfang's Money is Gone!"

-- Star

According to Feng Gengguang, a senior figure in the banking industry, Mei Lanfang's savings will only be enough to last for half a year from now. Since Mrs. Mei, Fu Zhifang, spends a lot of money, consuming more than ten thousand yuan a year, this has created Mei Lanfang's difficult situation. According to Mr. Feng, who used to be the president of the Bank of China and supported Mei the most, the friendship between the two is closer than flesh and blood. Mr. Feng's words are credible. As for whether Mei Lanfang will reappear on stage as a result, it is unknown.

### Scandals of Film People Behind the Lines

— Hai Xing

Gao Zhanfei is very important and resides quietly on the South Bank, rarely venturing into the city. Bai Yang is not often seen by Old Gao's side. One reason is the busyness of work, but also the numerous social engagements keep her too busy.

Although Li Lili and Luo Jingyu already have a child, reliable sources say that Lili's trip to the north to film "Storm on the Border" will bring scandalous rumors, and that new romantic entanglements are feared to occur after her return to Chongqing.

Situ Huimin came to Chongqing to direct "Hometown of White Clouds" over eight months ago. Initially, rumors spread that Situ was quite close to the film's lead actress, Feng Zi (Feng Ji Ren), but recent observations indicate that Feng Zi is approaching not Situ, but playwright Sun Shiyi.

### After Watching the Public Performance of "Destruction"

The tragedy "Destruction," without men, has finally been staged. I attended as a guest for this special play.

### Xin Yanqiu Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon

— Lord of Ke Yun Lou

Yanqiu, Wang Yuhua, has been off stage since the Lunar New Year, having left Shanghai for nearly half a year. Recently, she accepted a lucrative engagement to perform again in Shanghai. Li Shengzao and others will finish around the Double Tenth Festival, and the new star will be seen on the red carpet around mid-October.

Recently, among female Cheng School performers, Zhang Eyun, Wang Yuhua, and Hou Yulan are most praised. Eyun and others have performed in roles like Hua Shan, while Yuhua only performs Qing Shan roles, cautiously preserving the purity of the style. She has studied it diligently privately. In "Mandarin Duck Tomb" and "Jade Capital Taoist," both her singing and acting are excellent, almost indistinguishable from the original. This is highly appreciated by the aficionados. Last time she traveled south, she was hindered by illness, and her voice was not fully clear, leaving something to be desired. Now she has recovered, and her voice and appearance should be vastly different from the past. Since Yushuang's return north, the famous performers who have come to the Shanghai stage, such as Mao Shilai, Wu Suqiu, and Tong Zhiling, are all known for their Xun School performances. We, the enthusiasts of the Cheng School, suffer from having no music to enjoy. Now that Yuhua is here, the Cheng enthusiasts can feast their eyes and ears.

The story's content is as follows: Mrs. Hu, due to her worship of money, throws herself into the arms of the wealthy Mr. Hu, abandoning the true love of Mr. Wu. As a result, she is pushed off the balcony by Mr. Wu and injured, later regretting it. However, seventeen years later, her two daughters—Peiying and Peihua—follow in her footsteps, thus suspecting each other and heading towards destruction together. The plot is quite compact and feels somewhat cold.

The play is divided into five acts: the first and fifth acts have the same props, and the second, third, and fourth acts also have little change, except that there are two bottles of poison wine on the table.

Shangguan Yunzhu plays both Hu Peiying and Hu Chushan. She is more lively in the role of Hu Chushan than Hu Peiying. Leng Jing plays Mrs. Hu. The makeup in the first and last acts seems too young. Someone in their forties or fifties cannot be made up to look so young. Her lines are very fluent, making her the best at expressing emotions in this play. Lin Fen's Zhang Ma and Shao Dan's Hu Peihua are very good at portraying their personalities. Hong Wei's Mrs. Qian also adds a lot of color to the play. Cheng Ying plays Qu Qiwen, Li Heng plays Tian Xiuli, and Xiao Hui plays the maid, only Si Yun is considered competent.

The prompting sound in the first and fourth acts is too loud, which is a minor flaw in this public performance. All nine actors in this play are women, which is also very special. In short, in this Shanghai of extravagant indulgence, like Mrs. Hu said: "Vanity triumphs over reason." I don't know if there are...
