German Forces Occupy the Cassel Mountains; British and French Forces Fight to the Death. Allied Forces Retreat to the Coast to Defend the Dunkirk Area; Allied Counteroffensive on the Lower Somme Repelled. Paris

The General Headquarters announced in its war bulletin this morning: "The various military operations described in yesterday afternoon's war bulletin continued throughout the evening. The fighting in the areas of the Belgian Seer River and the French Cassel region was extremely fierce. Otherwise, there were no changes on the Somme River and other front lines." (Havas dispatch, 30th)

Paris

The General Headquarters announced in its war bulletin this evening: "The Allied forces of Britain and France are continuing their heroic resistance in northern France. Since the expansion of the Western Front, the northern Allied forces have been trapped by the enemy and lost contact with other units. They have been fighting fiercely in isolation for fifteen days. The enemy has been constantly reinforcing their forces and repeatedly attacking from the east and west, but the Allied forces are still fighting hard and refusing to give up an inch of ground. At times, they have even launched heroic counteroffensives, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. However, the forces under the command of King Leopold III of Belgium, defending the Belgian Sure River and the northeastern coastal port of Ostend, have ceased resistance at the King's command, opening a path for the enemy to attack Ypres, Furnes, and Dunkirk. Since then, the threat to our northern forces under the command of General Blanc Xia and General Prio has increased day by day, as has the threat to the British forces under the command of Lieutenant General Gort. Despite this grave situation, the British and French forces remain steadfast in their determination and are fighting hard to move towards the coast. Our forces are also assisting the army in defending the coastal ports and communication lines. As for the port of Dunkirk, it is being defended by a force led by Vice Admiral Able Al. Fortunately, the army, navy, and air force are working together effectively and achieving remarkable results. In addition, on the Somme River line, our forces launched a fierce offensive, destroying the bridgeheads occupied by the enemy on the south bank and capturing several hundred enemy soldiers. Elsewhere, there is nothing worth mentioning." (Havas dispatch, 29th)

London

According to a well-informed source in London today, fierce fighting is still taking place in the Front area. Although the British army has lost a great deal of war materiel, its main base's arsenal has not fallen into the hands of the German army. The British and French forces in the Front area are still fighting shoulder to shoulder as Englishmen. The Allied forces are currently engaged in small-scale mopping-up operations elsewhere on the front, and there have been no reports of any major attacks by either side. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Paris

Regarding the fighting in the Front area, military figures here recently stated that the main goal of the German army is to occupy the famous mountain area between Cassel and Ypres, in order to cut the Allied forces in two, and then advance on Lille, France, on one side, and head straight for the port of Dunkirk on the other. Although they have now occupied Mount Cassel, it is only one of the mountains in the Front area, and there are many obstacles ahead. After several areas of the French salient were breached by the German army, they have now retreated westward. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

Paris

According to a French military spokesperson, the main effort of the German army in the major battle in the Flanders region is to try to seize the famous "mountain line" between Cassel and Ypres, which divides the Lille region and the Dunkirk region, in order to cut the Allied forces into two sections. However, the German army is encountering fierce resistance from the Allied forces, mainly the British, in their offensives from the southwest and northeast. The German army on the Yser River has not yet made any progress. It is reported that the German army on another part of the front has gained a foothold in the Front province. The French forces, commanded by General Puliverques, are resisting the German attacks in the "bottom of the bag." The German army has only managed to enter in a few places. General Puliverques' troops are currently retreating northwest, fighting fierce rear-guard and flank battles. The intensity of the fighting has increased and continues day and night. The British Navy and Air Force have been very helpful in the battle. The other lines are completely quiet. The German army has destroyed all the defensive works built at the end of a bridge on the Somme River. The number of German troops participating in the major battle in the Front region is over one million. Almost all of the A Division participated. However, the strength of the Allied forces has been reduced by half by the defection of King Leopold of Belgium. However, the army is still fighting hard to resist and is trying to shorten the lines of defense to compensate for the weakness of being outnumbered. The port of Dunkirk has reportedly become a trench, firmly defended by the Allied forces, aided by the heavy artillery of the fleet. Dunkirk has now become a kind of corridor port on the coast, and both sides are currently fighting a decisive battle along this corridor. The Allied forces have now formed a double barrier, one part lined up along the Yser River, from Napoleon to Ypres, and the other part from Gravili Dar Cassel. The British army, commanded by General Gort, commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force, is currently at the forefront of the defense of the two lines. Germany is trying to occupy the famous "mountain line" of the Front province in the last war and break through it. If the German army occupies this "mountain line," the sea route to the Lille region will be cut off. The German army's southwest offensive from White Rouge aims at Dunkirk, but the German army has encountered fierce resistance from the British army on the Yser River. It is noteworthy that King Leopold of Belgium refused to defend the area with 15 divisions of his large army. The British army is now guarding it with weak forces, but it is still achieving remarkable results. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

London

Most of the northern British Expeditionary Force and the French army are facing a life-or-death situation that can be decided in a matter of hours. Although the British Navy and Air Force are doing their best to help, it is still difficult to resolve the crisis. The northern Allied forces are trapped 30 miles from the sea and 60 miles from the main force of the French army. They lack proper equipment and sufficient ammunition. They are in a "bag," almost surrounded. The French forces are moving more than the British forces in this Ypres trap. It is said that General Weygand, commander-in-chief of the Allied forces, in the hope of complete victory, has no choice but to let the trapped northern Allied forces take their own course. The sacrifices made by launching an unorganized counteroffensive are greater than the losses in Front. Today, the Allied Navy and the British Royal Air Force are working hard to rescue the troops trapped in Front. Under the cover of dense British naval artillery fire and British Air Force bombs, the British Expeditionary Force is retreating to the Dunkirk area, while the German army is pressing hard to prevent the British army from retreating. The German army's offensive is very fierce. A large number of bombers roar in the skies over the Strait, densely bombing Allied troops, warships, and even ambulance ships, with bombs falling like rain. Fierce fighting is approaching Dunkirk inch by inch. The British and French troops, with their courageous spirit, are covering the British Navy's retreat of their wounded comrades. At the same time, the naval artillery fire is flying towards the shore, and the Air Force is soaring in the sky, strictly guarding the coastal works and resisting the terrible German air raids. According to the wounded soldiers who arrived in England, some soldiers, in order to catch up with the ships evacuating the wounded soldiers, even waded through the water. Others first gathered on the beach and then attached themselves to small boats. The soldiers were all incompletely clothed, covered in blood, and filthy, looking extremely embarrassed.

German Head of State's Headquarters

A statement here said: "The great battle of Front and Artois is about to end. Since yesterday, the British Expeditionary Force has shown signs of complete collapse, abandoning countless weapons. German fighters shot down 28 enemy aircraft and sank three enemy warships and sixteen troop transport ships. Another ten warships and twenty-one merchant ships of various types were severely damaged or caught fire. The enemy forces on the lower reaches of the Anmei River used large numbers of tanks to attack the German forces in Nanzhen, but were repelled. German fighter planes attacked enemy airfields and destroyed several enemy aircraft." (Haitong dispatch, 30th)

Berlin

This afternoon, a statement from the German General Headquarters stated: "The enemy's tank forces attacked the German army in Nanzhen and were repelled. A large number of enemy troops in the Amiens Forest were bombed by German aircraft. On the south of the Poperinge and Cassel front, the German army launched a joint offensive from the east, west, and south, surrounding the enemy and cutting off their transportation routes. The Foreign Expeditionary Force completely collapsed, abandoning a large number of munitions and jumping into the water to try to swim to safety and return to British ships, but encountered German air raids and suffered heavy losses. Yesterday, the enemy lost eighty-nine aircraft, and fifteen German aircraft went missing." (Haitong dispatch, 30th)

German battlefield correspondent Gondelah wrote: "When the German mechanized units and tanks entered the town of Lakarbel, machine-gun bullets flew from all directions, some from windows, some from basements, and some from forests. German tanks, risking their lives in a hail of bullets, advanced and destroyed countless enemy nests, the most numerous of which were the enemies who were fighting desperately in the post office. German infantry hid behind tanks and threw grenades, destroying the houses occupied by the enemy. The enemy was finally overcome, and the town of Lakarbel fell into German hands." (Haitong dispatch, 30th)

A German military expert gave an interview to the Haitong News Agency yesterday, supplementing the official report issued by the German General Headquarters, and declared that the German army had gradually occupied the area where fierce battles had taken place in recent days, and had surrounded the important town of Otter in northern France. The Allied forces still occupy the territory from Lille to the coast to the north, but it is surrounded on all sides by German artillery. The port of Dunkirk is also under intense bombardment by German artillery. (Haitong dispatch, 30th)

According to reliable German sources, the French troops in Valenciennes have surrendered. Both sides have suffered extremely heavy casualties in the battle of Front. Yesterday, for the first time since the start of the German mechanized blitzkrieg, there were reports of hand-to-hand combat with small advance parties of the Allied forces. (United Press dispatch, 30th)

Berlin

German war zone correspondent Stark gave a detailed report on the German army's crossing of the Labassi Canal, which is excerpted as follows: "The Labassi Canal is an important waterway in northern France. The French army blew up the river bridge, which was a key move to hinder transportation. When the German engineers arrived at the canal, they immediately rushed to build a pontoon bridge so that the tanks could cross the river in a short time to attack the French army and cut off the enemy's retreat to the northwest. At that time, the enemy's machine guns and tank guns were still constantly firing at the German army across the water. After the commander of the front personally observed the battle situation, he reported to the chief of staff and asked for instructions. He was ordered to send tanks to advance, destroy the enemy machine gun positions, and send the air force to bomb the retreating enemy. The enemy could not withstand the fierce bombing. After resisting for a long time, they finally could not hold on and retreated. The German motorized infantry led the troops across the river first, followed by the infantry, and then the tanks followed. The German infantry marched day and night, covered in dirt, and continued to advance tirelessly. Suddenly, they heard the sound of French tanks firing. The German offensive tank guns and artillery immediately returned fire. German aircraft also flew to help in the battle, bombing the enemy artillery and tank teams and destroying them. A fierce battle thus came to an end." (Haitong dispatch, 30th)

German Forces Continue to Advance Towards the Coast; The Great Battle of the Isère River Begins Paris

Recently, the French side declared that 2,000 of the 5,000 tanks used by the German army in the battlefield since they entered the Netherlands and Belgium have been destroyed. The German army has shown signs of fatigue after three weeks of fighting, controlling most of the Netherlands and Belgium and the strongholds along the eastern coast of the English Channel. There were no reports late last night as to which side had prevailed in the Battle of Napoleon. However, it is generally believed that the fate of the Allied First Army will depend entirely on the ability of the British and French to use the waters of the Isère River to cover the troops on the left flank, from which the commander of the small army will encircle Dunkirk in a semicircle and defend the coast from Calais to Napoleon. According to the waterlogging of the Isère River in 1914, it was an effective way to prevent the German army from advancing during the European War. The last message received in Paris yesterday was that the German army was putting great pressure on the Allied forces in the "bottom of the bag," that is, the 20-mile gap abandoned after the Belgian army surrendered. British and French forces are fighting on the Isère River again today, 26 years later. In 1914, the campaign there, from October 18 to November 1, obstructed the German army's advance towards the English Channel. During the European War, the flooded Isère River always prevented the German army from crossing the Tisza and Napoleon lines. The Napoleon locks were the target of yesterday's battle. If the French army arrives there first, the Isère River will flood the lowlands of the sand and mud in 24 hours, making it impossible for German tanks to pass. (United Press dispatch, 30th)

The King of England Cables the Commander of the Expeditionary Force to Commend the Soldiers for Their Valiant Fighting London

The King of England cabled the Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, commending the Expeditionary Force for their valiant fighting. The text read: "The Expeditionary Force has encountered a situation that is beyond its control, and is in an extremely difficult position, but it is still able to demonstrate the courage of the British Army. The people of the country are full of admiration for the Expeditionary Force's heroic resistance in the past two weeks of continuous battles. At this critical moment, everyone's heart is focused on you and the brave troops you command." The Commander-in-Chief replied in the text to thank him, saying that the entire army is now doing its best to maintain its glorious tradition. In this dangerous situation, receiving Your Majesty's encouraging telegram is a great encouragement and inspiration. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

London

A senior officer of the British Expeditionary Force, who recently returned from the war zone, gave a radio address yesterday, detailing the heroic achievements of the British Expeditionary Force. He said that after the British army joined forces with the Belgian army east of Brussels, it repeatedly thwarted the enemy's offensive with great fearlessness. It was not until the enemy invaded another front on its south side that it was forced to retreat. The difficulty of the situation at that time was almost unbelievable. Fortunately, Commander Dunton was in charge and the soldiers fought bravely, which made it possible to complete this difficult task. The smooth retreat of the British army's mechanized units under the fierce bombing of the enemy's air force and the tenacious support of the rearguard troops were the most prominent continuations of the British army's retreat. At that time, the rift in the south was not closed, which allowed the German armored and mechanized units to pour in. The communication lines of the Allied forces had been cut off, and their flanks and rear were exposed. Although the Belgian army on the left and the French army on the right were firmly holding their ground, they had to make new arrangements for the two new lines of defense, one to the south and the other to the west, in order to cope with the powerful enemy that was quickly taking an encirclement. Although the British were deployed on a long front and lost contact with the main forces in France, they were still able to counterattack on the spot and even launched a large-scale counterattack against the enemy near Arras and won a victory. Unfortunately, due to the lack of strength of the armored vehicle units, they were unable to break through the enemy's encirclement and had no choice but to hold their ground to prevent the enemy from rushing in. In the area where the British army was trapped, there were many refugees, which made military activities extremely difficult. The German army launched fierce attacks in many places, but they were all repelled by the British army and suffered heavy damage. The officer expressed his admiration for the calmness of Viscount Gort's command, the bravery of the British army's fighting, and the spirit of sacrifice in the air war. He also said that the British Expeditionary Force's encirclement this time was not due to its own mistakes. The achievements it has made in the past and is making now should be a source of pride for the entire British Empire. The only thing that the people of the country should do now is to double their efforts at work, so that the new army currently being trained can be better equipped, so that it can continue to bear the great work that the current soldiers are doing in France.

According to a telegram from the Swedish capital, the Allied forces encountered unparalleled resistance in Narvik. However, under the cover of heavy British artillery fire, the Allied forces finally entered the city from both sides. During the battle, German bombers attacked non-stop, and several of them were shot down. The Allied forces' occupation of Narvik is very important, because the transportation between the German army and Sweden has been restored, and the entire northern Norway is now protected by the Narvik front and can be used as a base for advancing south.

The Air Ministry announced that British Air Force fighter squadrons had made several contacts with multiple enemy aircraft squadrons that were bombing in France and the Belgian coast yesterday. Although the enemy aircraft were protected by a powerful fighter squadron, British aircraft still attacked them at any time. A total of 52 enemy aircraft were shot down in one day, including 25 bombers. In addition, 17 were severely damaged. Ten British fighters went missing. The British Naval Air Force attacked an enemy seaplane base on the Dutch coast, destroying several hangars and aircraft. Another British naval aircraft shot down an enemy bomber in the North Sea and severely damaged another enemy aircraft. In the Bergen area, a British reconnaissance aircraft bombed an enemy supply ship and set it on fire. In the evening, the British heavy bomber squadron was very active in assisting the army in its operations. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Editorial: Bombing Chongqing and Sino-Japanese-American-Soviet Relations

"The Japanese side plans to bomb Chongqing every day until the Chinese spirit of resistance is broken": "There are many military targets and anti-aircraft guns in Chongqing that must be destroyed," said the Japanese naval spokesperson in Hankou yesterday when hosting newspaper reporters, regarding the plan and significance of the Japanese air force's daily air raids on Chongqing. Chongqing is cloudy and rainy all year round, but this season is clear, so the Japanese side is trying to carry out its atrocities. As far as we know, Japanese aircraft once flew to Chongqing on the 4th of this month for an air raid; and from the 26th to yesterday, there was an air raid on Chongqing for five consecutive days; what will happen today is unknown, but according to the Japanese spokesperson in Hankou, it will probably continue. Looking at telegrams from all sides, the number of Japanese aircraft that raided Chongqing was 136 on the 26th, 160 on the 27th, 98 on the 28th, 63 on the 29th, and 27 yesterday; compared with the war reports on the European continent, this is nothing to be ashamed of; but since Chongqing is a capital city and not a military fortress, it is inevitable that lives and materials will suffer considerable damage under the daily bombing of dozens or hundreds of aircraft. It is reported that schools, hospitals, newspaper offices, city houses, and private residences have been hit the most, and young students, the old, the weak, women, and children, and unarmed civilians have been "torn apart, with blood and flesh scattered everywhere," and thousands have died tragically in this massacre. Foreign embassies and consulates in Chongqing, or news agencies, have had their houses destroyed and people injured but not killed, or were only a few steps away from the bombs, or were hit by bombs that did not explode, all of which were fortunate. Reviewing the Japanese explanation for the air raids on Chongqing based on all these things, it proves that none of them are not deceptive. Chongqing is the provisional capital of China during the Anti-Japanese War, where the central administrative organs are located, and where foreign envoys and reporters gather, which is a matter of course; with the Japanese indiscriminate bombing, no matter how the administrative organs should not be regarded as bombing targets, they may not be able to avoid being hit; even foreign ambassadors and Chinese children must have the same chance of danger in this way; from the point of view of military operations, is the Japanese air raid on Chongqing as meaningful as the Japanese spokesperson explained? Or, with the same opportunity, add it to them, all the officials, people, old and young, men and women inside and outside Chongqing City, regardless of their nationality, mission, and status, and make them suffer the same danger; this is the meaning of the air raid on Chongqing contained and revealed by the Japanese action, and which was not explained by the Japanese spokesperson. China does have some military and political organs in Chongqing, but their nature is administrative organs and should not be regarded as military organs as military targets. China does have anti-aircraft guns deployed in Chongqing to defend against illegal air raids, but to bomb them because they are anti-aircraft guns, what is the difference between not being satisfied with a patrolman and moving the police. It is even more ridiculous to say that the air raids on Chongqing are intended to destroy the Chinese spirit of resistance; the Chinese spirit of resistance to aggression is all over the country, not just in Chongqing; even if Chongqing is bombed and the whole city becomes a rubble field, it will not only not destroy the spirit of resistance, but will strengthen the nation's resistance. Even Chongqing, which has been ravaged for days, is praised by the French Havas News Agency for its popular morale, saying that "the spirit of the residents of the whole city is as usual, and there is no sign of discouragement"; the British Reuters News Agency praises its achievements, saying that "the city's telephones were damaged, and the repair team immediately set out to repair them, and telephone service was restored within two hours." Last year in this season, Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing severely; after a year, the achievements of the Chinese side in the war of resistance have become more and more obvious, and the belief in victory has become more and more firm; the Japanese side is desperately seeking a quick solution to the so-called China Incident due to the hopelessness of military aggression, and the call for this has been high and clear and has penetrated the government and the public. Thus, we can know how trivial the Japanese plan and significance of bombing Chongqing every day are! However, from a humanitarian point of view, the world cannot forgive and tolerate it because of its triviality. In China, because it cannot be forgiven and cannot be tolerated, it continues to demand compensation for the blood debt through the war of resistance. The Chinese government and the public have always had their determination and perseverance, and there is no need for any kind of empty words to encourage them, so there is no need to dwell on it. In the United States, according to yesterday's Washington telegram: "A State Department official recalled last night that the U.S. government has always and repeatedly condemned the atrocities of bombing civilians, such as yesterday's Japanese air raid on Chongqing. The State Department official said that there is no need to reiterate this policy at present; the country that bombs civilians has long understood the U.S. government's attitude." The United States has always had its clear and strict attitude, so there is no need to dwell on it, so it is said that there is no need to reiterate this policy at present; however, empty words of condemnation are ineffective, so its objective factual results are no different from forgiveness and tolerance; this cannot but eagerly expect the concretion of the U.S. attitude and the actionalization of the policy. Even if it cannot take concrete action immediately from the active side, it should at least immediately abandon the interests of "blood money" from the passive side and immediately stop all trades that aid evil and abet violence; the presidents of the three universities of Chongqing University, Fudan University, and Central University appealed to the United States to promptly impose an embargo on steel and oil on Japan, and to no longer continue to support its aggression and to stop its irredeemable tyranny in time, which is a reasonable and earnest wish; President Roosevelt has already decided that the entire government and the public should do their best, and not to allow the Chinese people to suffer pain and suffering. In the Soviet Union, it has assisted China in silence for many years, and has given many real benefits; it is hoped that on the issue of bombing civilians, it will condemn it in parallel with the United States, and strive to make it effective. The safety of the Far East is at stake, and China bears the brunt, and it does not underestimate itself; the Soviet Union and the United States are both important factors in stabilizing the Far East. How should they establish a deep mutual understanding for the Far East, and how should they start with parallel condemnation of Japan? Finally, I would like to take the liberty to inform the Japanese side: any nation will resist foreign aggression with all its might: there is no innate animosity between China and Japan, only aggression and resistance to aggression. Eliminating resistance requires correcting aggression, and there will be no end to resistance if there is no end to aggression. The Chinese national consciousness is here, so what is the benefit of bombing Chongqing? Is it not said that bombing Chongqing is because it is the capital, because it is the seat of government organs: is it not a delusion to destroy one government, so as to make it easier to foster another "government"? In fact, occupying Nanjing is equivalent to making Wuhan the capital, and occupying Wuhan is equivalent to making Chongqing the capital, which means that occupying Ninghan has not been able to occupy the capital; destroying this house is equivalent to moving to another house, which means that bombing and destroying houses has not been able to bomb and destroy organs and governments. Therefore, bombing Chongqing is absolutely not enough to promote the so-called quick settlement of the China Incident; it is even more absurd than climbing a tree to catch fish, and even more misleading than going south by driving the chariot north. It is reported that Italy notified France that it was preparing to participate in the European War; Mussolini was scheduled to convene a cabinet meeting early next week; diplomatic talks between the Soviet Union and Italy had been interrupted London

The U.S. No Money Radio announcer said last night that Italy had notified France that it intended to join the war. British officials said that they had not received any news that could be believed, and that the Italian government would never seek to make such a notification to Britain. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

Paris

Well-informed sources said that the Italian attitude has reached a near-decisive stage. Mussolini has gone to the countryside for a few days of rest to make major decisions. After returning to Beijing, he will deliver an important speech. As for how Italy's participation in the war will affect the situation, the fire, France, the Danube River countries, and the Soviet diplomatic circles have been discussing it. In general, Turkey will inevitably react because it does not want Italy's power to expand in the eastern Mediterranean. Bulgaria will then take its attitude as a transition. The Soviet Union attaches importance to Bulgaria and there is a theory that the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, will be transferred to the Minister to Bulgaria, which is why.

An organized slogan propaganda campaign is now taking place here, supporting Italy's participation in the European War and the realization of its territorial aspirations in the Mediterranean. The slogan mentions the name of the French protectorate of Tunisia in North Africa, and there is also a huge picture, showing Tunisia and the Italian island of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea, and a huge pistol, pointing from the Berried naval base in Tunisia directly at the port of Palermo in Italian Sicily, with a note saying, "The port of Berried in the hands of the French is tantamount to aiming a pistol at the side of Sicily."

The New Daily News of Zurich recently reported that Italy and the Soviet Union had diplomatic contact through Germany as a medium, and then directly consulted. The Italian side issued a statement saying that if the country took any action in a corner of the Mediterranean, it hoped that the Soviet Union would not interfere in the Mediterranean. However, the talks were soon interrupted. Italian newspapers then raised the issue of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. The Moscow side said that this issue did not involve Italian interests at first, but on the contrary, the Soviet Union had a vital relationship. Therefore, if the European war spreads to the eastern Mediterranean, the Soviet Union will naturally come out to defend its interests. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

King Leopold of Belgium Orders a Ceasefire; The Process; Previously Plotted to Reorganize the Government; Did Not Obtain the Consent of Cabinet Members Paris

A certain person in Belgian political circles, who has always maintained close contact with those in the French northern part of the country's government directing operations, recently gave an interview to a Havas Agency interviewer, giving a detailed account of the process by which the country's King Leopold III surrendered to the German army, learning that he had made a final struggle before ordering a ceasefire, attempting to reorganize the government to preserve "considerable independence." According to the account, the country's Prime Minister Biero, Foreign Minister Spark, Defense Minister Tennis, and Interior Minister Van der Borden hastily fled from the city of Bruges on the 25th of this month, when the enemy forces had advanced to the vicinity of the city, no more than six kilometers away. Prime Minister Biero and his party had no choice but to travel to London via the French port of Dunkirk. On the night of the following day, the 26th, Leopold attempted to reorganize the government to replace the Biero government, and immediately used the fearful telephone to contact the cabinet members in London. He intended to have any cabinet member countersign the document so that a new cabinet could be formed. According to the Belgian constitution, the King only needs to obtain the countersignature of one cabinet member to reorganize the cabinet. The King's plan was another act of treason against the country. Fortunately, the cabinet members, starting with Prime Minister Biero, all unanimously refused in strong terms. Leopold's plan failed, and he disregarded everything and ordered a ceasefire. It turns out that the King's move was not out of accidental military need, but the result of many past facts. Yuan Guotu has always tried to avoid making the relationship between Belgium and Germany more serious, even after the outbreak of the war, he also sought to give up this idea, for example, as early as the beginning of the European war, he prohibited Belgian cabinet members from going to France to discuss cooperation issues, this is the first one; he repeatedly tried to set up a news censorship method, but it could not be implemented due to the absolute opposition of the cabinet members, this is the second one; after the German army invaded Belgium, he firmly refused to convene the Parliament, and also refused to publish a broadcast speech at the request of the cabinet members, depreciating Germany, this is the third one; even in his edict to encourage the defenders of the Liege and Namur fortresses, the wording was ambiguous, with no inspiring and generous style, this is the fourth one; regarding the evacuation of residents in the areas threatened by Belgium, he always refused to exchange views with the French authorities, this is the fifth one; From these, it can be seen that he has been plotting to betray the country for a long time. When he first discussed the issue of surrender with the cabinet members, the cabinet members all earnestly advised him that he had not followed the guidance of General Weygand, the commander of the Allied forces. He said that the Belgian army was already too "tired" to fight again. The cabinet members replied that the morale was excellent and they could continue to resist, and even told him that the military leaders had been whispering privately about the King's command of operations, and even adding the words "treason." Minister of National Defense Tennis even went a step further, urging the King not to forget his responsibility as the Belgian commander, and said that according to the unwritten laws of war, there is absolutely no reason to surrender on the battlefield without fighting. But Leopold turned a deaf ear to this loyal advice and insisted on surrendering. At the last meeting, Prime Minister Biero still said that the act was enough to disgrace the country, hoping that the King would stop on the edge of the cliff, and made it clear that what the King did had exceeded the powers prescribed by the Constitution. But the speaker spoke earnestly, and the listener turned a deaf ear. The cabinet members knew that the general trend was over, so they resolutely left, which is the process by which the King succumbed. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

On the Shan Tai Steamer, a Cabin Search Uncovers a Major Case of Illegally Smuggling Legal Tender
A Customs Officer, Carrying Over Ten Thousand Yuan in Legal Tender, Attempts to Transport it to Shanghai for Profit, Falling into the Net of the Law

The Shan Tai Steamer, belonging to the Portuguese Zhengde Company, which operates a direct line between Shanghai and Ningbo, arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo on the 28th of this month. Just as it was about to set sail, the Zhejiang Customs discovered a major case of a passenger on board illegally smuggling a large sum of legal tender for export. The perpetrator was apprehended along with the illicit goods. The details are as follows:

Knowing the Law and Breaking It

At noon on the 28th, just as the Portuguese Shan Tai Steamer was about to set sail from Ningbo, the Zhejiang Customs and the Ningbo Garrison Command received a report that a passenger on board was illegally smuggling a large sum of legal tender for export. They immediately dispatched officers to board the ship for inspection. The passenger carrying the legal tender was named Wang Fangzhen, a clerk in the secretariat of the Zhejiang Customs. When he boarded the ship, he carried a leather suitcase and a leather bag. The customs inspection team and tax police at the dock, knowing him as a customs officer, were familiar with him and did not suspect anything. They allowed him to board the ship. Subsequently, based on a confidential report, they boarded the ship and went directly to Wang's cabin to inspect it. Upon opening his suitcase, they discovered a large amount of legal tender hidden under his clothes.

Confiscation in Full

According to the crew members of the Shan Tai Steamer who came to Shanghai, the amount seized at that time totaled 158,000 yuan, which was truly astonishing. According to investigations, the legal tender was entrusted to him by two customs brokerages in Ningbo to be transported to Shanghai, each with an amount of 50,000 yuan. The remaining 58,000 yuan has not yet been identified. In addition to confiscating the legal tender in full in accordance with regulations, the Customs has also dismissed Wang and sent him to the Ningbo District Court for interrogation. The customs brokerages involved in the case have been summoned for questioning. The Shan Tai Steamer was delayed until that evening due to this incident before setting sail for Shanghai, arriving at the port the morning before yesterday and continuing its voyage to Ningbo yesterday morning.

Public Concession Board Discusses
Local Employment of Staff
Exchange Subsidies to be Abolished
Proposal to Deny Extended Leave Rejected

On the 16th of this month, the Public Concession Board's Personnel Committee held its first meeting of the year. Committee member Bao Hui'er was elected as the chairman of the committee. Subsequently, another meeting was held on the 23rd, during which various aspects of the Board's future local employment of staff were discussed. It was determined that, after the Board's decision, the exchange subsidies for locally employed staff's salaries or other service benefits should be abolished, except in special cases.

Someone proposed that the Board should employ local staff as much as possible and not grant extended leave. The Personnel Committee expressed its agreement with this proposal, with the exception of police officers. This is because the duties of police officers are of a special nature and cannot be compared with those of other personnel. Moreover, personnel in other similar institutions in this port are also granted extended leave. Therefore, in order to attract suitable police talent, this benefit must be allowed. At the same time, the exchange subsidies for salaries during extended leave should also be paid as usual. After deliberation, the proposal was passed by the Board of Directors at its regular meeting on the 29th of this month.

British Tax Police Officer Suffocates to Death
His Wife Faints Upon Hearing the News
Doctor's Efforts to Save Him Fail, Dies Yesterday Morning
Servant Highly Suspected, Arrested and Awaiting Investigation

According to the English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao," a British man named Qi Geweiden, a former police officer in the water patrol, was sixty years old and resided at No. 1, Lane 304, Nanxun Road. On the evening of the 28th, two thieves broke into his residence, bound Qi with rope, and gagged his mouth. Neighbors alerted the police, and the two thieves fled empty-handed. However, Qi, due to his advanced age and weakness, and with his mouth gagged,

Barely Breathed

He died before help could arrive. Qi's wife, who is ninety-eight years old and suffering from stomach ailments, had been hospitalized at the Gongji Hospital for two weeks. Yesterday (the 29th) afternoon, upon hearing the tragic news of her husband's death, she immediately fainted. Although doctors tried their best to save her, she finally succumbed at 3:30 PM today (the 30th) at Gongji Hospital. A servant at the Qi residence is suspected and has been detained by the police. After the robbery occurred, detectives arrived at the scene and found the servant

Acting Suspiciously

The police believe that the servant knows something about the robbery. Because the servant is also ill, he was sent to the police hospital for treatment yesterday morning and will be handed over to the court for questioning. The coroner of the British Court will re-examine Qi's body tomorrow (the 31st). Qi joined the water patrol in 1960. The following year, while patrolling alone on the

Huangpu River

He encountered smugglers and tried to stop them. Qi, armed only with a baton, was attacked by the smugglers with bamboo poles. As a result, Qi's ankle was severely injured. He could only walk with a steel splint, and never fully recovered. Qi retired in 1927, and suffered especially from his injury in his later years.

### Hui Mingzhi Death After Surgery Case
Continued Trial Yesterday
Witnesses Awaiting Re-examination

Hui Mingzhi, an employee of the Xinxin Company, went to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment due to chest tightness. After being ordered to be hospitalized by the hospital, without seeking the consent of Hui or his family, they hastily performed surgery on Hui. After a few days, Hui's wound

Ruptured and Sutures Came Undone

Leading to Excessive Bleeding. Hui's wife, Zhu Shuxiang, urgently requested

Blood Clotting

The hospital demanded ten yuan for the injection fee, which caused a significant delay. Excessive blood loss eventually led to his death. Hui Zhu Shuxiang believes that her husband's death was due to the negligence of the attending physician, Xie Jiashu, and sued him in the First Special Court for causing death due to professional negligence. After several summons, Yan attributed the responsibility for the surgery to

The Hospital Director

Dr. Bai De, a German physician. Hui Zhu added lawyer Qian Zheng to the lawsuit, also listing Xiang De as a co-defendant. Yesterday morning, the case was heard by Judge Liu Yugui in the Third Criminal Court. Regarding this case, Judge Liu had ordered forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan to prepare an opinion. According to the forensic report, the defendant claimed that the deceased suffered from liver cancer,

Which Was a Terminal Illness

And that surgery would only increase the patient's pain. Therefore, the forensic doctors believed that the surgery performed by doctors Xie and Bai was merely a scientific experiment. When the court session opened, the defendant denied Hui Zhu's claim that the deceased died from excessive bleeding due to the delay in injection. He said that Hui Mingzhi did not bleed at that time and that the injection was not delayed. The plaintiff's lawyer Qian and others argued that since the defendant claimed that the deceased did not bleed, why was a hemostatic injection given?

Contradictory Remarks

Very Obvious
Moreover, they said, the patient in the same room, surnamed Wang, and the plaintiff's cousin, Ms. Zhang, witnessed the bleeding. They requested that they be summoned for questioning, so that the truth could be revealed. The defendant's lawyer, Liu Shifang, and others believed that the plaintiff's request to summon witnesses was a delay tactic. The court ruled that the two witnesses presented by the plaintiff needed to be summoned and ordered a postponement for further questioning.

Shanghai West Gambling Dens
Closing Tonight
Powerful Individuals Still Exerting Influence to Intervene

The gambling dens in western Shanghai have been managed by the Aftermath Committee of a certain entertainment venue and are all scheduled to close on May 31st (today). Therefore, the gambling dens have been busy organizing and preparing to close as scheduled. However, the owners of the gambling dens, although they know that the end of May is the deadline and cannot be extended, are still trying their best to petition the committee to reopen for profit, especially by offering large sums of money as rewards. The Aftermath Committee is using the maintenance of the livelihoods of more than ten thousand workers as a reason to petition their superiors for a slight delay. It is expected that some of the more powerful individuals will be able to continue operating. It was rumored yesterday that Hollywood on Yuyuan Road was suddenly ordered to close by a certain party. According to a reporter from Huaguang News Agency, this is not the case. The news that the site will be converted into a "Garrison Headquarters" is also misinformation. In the future, the "Headquarters" will be located at the original site of Qiuyuan. Therefore, Qiuyuan has been undergoing renovations for the past few days.

Liang Kunshan, a native of Hubei, was thirty-two years old and lived at No. 14, Changchunfang, Datong Road, Zhabei. Liang had a mistress who lived at No. 31, Renjili, Shanhaiguan Road, Public Concession. Yesterday afternoon at 7:30 PM, Liang went to his mistress's place for pleasure again.

Seeing Liang enter, he followed him in and, without asking any questions, pulled out the sharp knife and stabbed Liang more than ten times, including eight times in the left leg and buttocks, one time in the left shoulder, one time in the back shoulder, and one time in the head and neck. He fell to the ground, unconscious. The perpetrator, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled.

Engagement Broken Due to Fiance's Insulting Correspondence
Failure to Fulfill Compensation Terms
Woman Hires Lawyer to File Lawsuit

Bi Xiangqing, a young man from Ningbo currently studying in his second year at Guanghua University, was studying at Zhijiang University before Hangzhou fell. When Hangzhou fell and the situation in Ningbo and Shaoxing became tense, his family was located at No. 30, Lane 340, Edward Road, Shanghai, where they operated the Tongfengyuan Foreign Goods Store, managed by his elder brother Bi Juqing (also known as Quqing). He accompanied his widowed mother, who lived in his hometown, to Shanghai and

Resided in Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road, Public Concession
While his brother and sister-in-law lived at No. 27, Lane 820, Julai Road, French Concession. Quqing and a certain Shao

Were Longtime Friends

In the winter of 1933, he heard that Shao had a younger sister, Yue'e, who was about the same age as his younger brother and exceptionally beautiful. She was studying in their hometown. They were a perfect match for his younger brother. He reported this to his mother, who agreed. He then enlisted Qiu Weizhao as a matchmaker. After Qiu spoke to the Shao family, the engagement was finalized. At that time, Xiangqing was only fourteen years old and had no objections. Afterwards, he and his fiancée exchanged frequent letters, and the degree of their love and affection

Increased With the Years
Up until the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, one was studying in Shanghai, hoping to further his education, and the other was serving his hometown, caring for wounded soldiers. However, their passionate love reached a boiling point due to their age. Almost every letter contained words of love, and many were obscene. Some even mentioned that Shao's daughter was "half male, half female." At first, she thought it was just a writer's frivolity and was only slightly annoyed. But upon reading these words, she realized that her fiancé was definitely not "writing out of amusement" and was in fact

Intentionally Insulting Her

She immediately retaliated, and their relationship broke down. Xiangqing then used the excuse that he was too young when the engagement was made and had not expressed his opinion. Now that he was an adult, he felt that the marriage was not suitable and that he was not bound by the previous engagement. He sent a letter to Shao's daughter requesting to dissolve the engagement and stated that if she did not accept his proposal, he would publish it in the newspaper. The Shao family, thinking that both families were reputable and that it would be embarrassing to publish it in the newspaper, reluctantly agreed to dissolve the engagement but proposed terms for compensation. However, Xiangqing, seeing that the goal of dissolving the engagement had been achieved,

Disregarded the Damage Compensation

After repeated negotiations, there was no result. Shao's daughter is currently very busy with her work as a nurse for wounded soldiers and cannot neglect her duty to save lives because of personal matters. Therefore, she sent a letter to her elder brother, who runs a business at No. 10, Jingyuan Street, Wuma Road, Shanghai, to hire lawyer Peng Xuehai to file a lawsuit against Bi Quqing and Xiangqing for compensation. Yesterday morning, the First Special Court summoned them for questioning. The most important issue in this case is Bi Xiangxiang's actual age. The matter has been deferred until Guanghua University verifies this information.

Youth Extorting Fined

Fang Caichun, a youth from Ningbo, was unable to make up for his gambling debts. Between the 14th and 22nd of this month, he wrote three threatening letters in succession, extorting 20,000 yuan in national currency from Rong Zhimin, the owner of the Yuanyufang Hardware Store at No. 4, Lane 702, Beijing Road. Rong reported the letters to the police, who sent detectives in disguise to make contact. Fang was arrested in front of the Xu Chongdao Pharmacy on Avenue Edward VII and sent to the First Special Court for public prosecution on charges of extortion. Judge Jiang conducted an investigation and, yesterday morning, sentenced Fang Caichun to one year in prison for attempted extortion. Before serving his sentence, he was sent to a rehabilitation center for five months of education. The three threatening letters were confiscated.

Assaulting Workers' Representative
Six Perpetrators Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months Each

The workers became angry at Li for siding with the foreign boss and threatened him. On the morning of the 8th of this month at 8:45 AM, they took advantage of the work stoppage to violently assault Li. Six people, including Tie and Jiang, a native of Jiangbei, Ding Fugui, and Wang Yide, were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunji requested that they be severely punished. Yesterday morning, each of them was sentenced to three years and six months in prison as a warning.

Letter
I recently read in your newspaper's "Social News" column about the fire at No. 29, Gongguanma Road, French Concession, and that the fire originated from No. 24, Kong Wenquan, who has been detained by the police for investigation, and that the Kong residence had a Buddhist hall on the second floor. The fire actually originated from No. 29, Gongtai Pharmacy, and the delay in calling for help caused it to spread to No. 24. The police detectives detained the old clerk of No. 29. There is no Buddhist hall on the second floor of our house (No. 24), which is rented to a family surnamed Wang. I am afraid of confusing the public. Please correct this error.
Sincerely,
Kong Wenqiu, No. 24, Shengliping Lane, Gongguanma Road

Public Concession
Board of Education Committee Meeting
Yuan Deng Elected as Chairman of the Committee
Hua Tong Sports Ground Set Up on Hart Road

On May 17th, the Education Committee of the Public Concession Board held its first meeting of the current term. Committee member Yuan Ludeng was elected as the chairman of the committee. The following cases were discussed and approved and approved by the Board of Directors at its regular meeting on the 29th of this month:

(1) The case of setting up a Hua Tong Reading Room and Sports Ground: The proposal to set up a Hua Tong Reading Room and Sports Ground was already proposed last year by the "Subsidies Allocation Committee for Chinese Schools" under the association. The expenditure was set at 20,000 yuan, which was deducted from the aforementioned subsidy funds. The principle was adopted by the bureau. Since finding a location became difficult, the matter has not been implemented. This meeting was submitted for discussion again. In terms of funding, in addition to the 20,000 yuan remaining from last year's request for movement, another 20,000 yuan was allocated from this year's subsidy, totaling 40,000 yuan. According to the report of the Chief of the Engineering Office, there is a piece of land on Hart Road, about eight acres in size, which is a property owned by the Bureau and can be used as a children's sports ground. The estimated cost is about 3,000 yuan. This proposal was decided to be implemented. As for the address of the children's reading room, efforts should be made to find it as soon as possible.

(2) The number of scholarships for Hua Tong Public School: The issue of setting up the number of scholarships for Hua Tong Public School was put forward for consideration this time. It was found that the number of scholarships so far is a total of 55, and the amount of the scholarship is 160 yuan per person. Of these, 14 will expire at the end of June this year. The number of students in various Chinese public schools this year is very small compared to last year, so the number of scholarships should be increased in the same way as last year. After discussion, it was resolved that 15 students should be added from September this year (the total number is 66), and the method is the same as the one adopted last year. The distribution is as follows: (A) Two students per school, totaling ten; (B) A total of fifteen new students, including six boys and three girls from the Bureau-run Hua Tong Elementary School, and four boys and two girls from non-Bureau-run elementary schools in the Public Concession.

Fudan University Teachers and Students Will
Mourn Sun Hanbing and Others
Telegram of Condolences to Fudan University in Sichuan

Japanese planes have attacked Chongqing for days, indiscriminately bombing it. Sun Hanbing, director of academic affairs at Fudan University, and many staff and students were tragically killed in the bombing in Chongqing on the afternoon of the 27th of this month. According to news from this port, Sun has two mothers, one legal and one concubine, in Shanghai, and left behind a wife and four children. Upon hearing the bad news, teachers, students, relatives and friends of Sun at Fudan University in this city were all deeply saddened. In addition to sending telegrams of condolences, a memorial ceremony will be held to express condolences. However, due to the special environment, it is not intended to be overly extravagant. It is also learned that the school authorities telegraphed Chongqing on the 27th to investigate the truth, claiming that both the university and middle school departments of the school in Chongqing were hit by bombs and damaged. It is presumed that Fudan University and Middle School in Chongqing are not in the same location and are tens of miles apart, so it is unlikely that both were bombed at the same time. However, no reply has been received from the school in Chongqing yet.
