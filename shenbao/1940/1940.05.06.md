### Pravda's Commentary on the Sino-Japanese War

The United Front in China is Consolidated; Japan Encounters Serious Difficulties

Moscow: Pravda today published an article discussing the Sino-Japanese situation, titled "China's Struggle for Independence." The article stated, "The Chinese people continue to fight for national independence with a resolute will. The decisive factor in China's destiny is not the composition of the leaders, but the national anti-Japanese united front. The structure and driving force of this united front includes the vast masses of the Chinese people and the most powerful political parties. The democratization of the Chinese government has consolidated this united front. A new China has grown up in the war. Only by continuing to implement the policy of the national anti-Japanese united front with a courageous spirit can the victory of the Chinese people be guaranteed." Regarding Japan's position, the newspaper stated, "Japan is now trying its best to clarify the China Incident." The Japanese ruling class's ideal "peace can only satisfy the basic demands of Japanese imperialism, but for China, independence must be lost through this kind of peace." In 1940, the Japanese economy will encounter new disasters and serious difficulties. Before Japan takes action in the Pacific and South China Sea, it will try to end the China Incident. (4th TASS)

Editorial

### Understanding What Should Exist in a Military Stalemate

The war between China and Japan has been stuck in a stalemate for more than a year, which is obvious to all. Naturally, from the winter before last to the present, the Japanese side has not abandoned its attempts at strategic offensives, and China has constantly responded with local counter-offensives. The Chinese army's counter-offensives have sometimes achieved significant victories, and the Japanese army's incursions have invariably ended in defeat. The rise and fall of the strength of both sides has also been developing in the opposite direction. In general, in this stage, looking only at the battles, neither army has made major advances or retreats. As a result, some people—especially those who are far from the front line and do not directly feel the impact of the war—inevitably gradually lose the tense and serious impression they had before, and instead tend to become indifferent and weak, even close to forgetting, as if they are not in a great era of survival and enslavement. This situation does exist in various places, especially in places like Shanghai, an isolated island; this is undeniable, and there is no need to deny it, and we believe that this situation is an important reason for the recent occurrence of some undesirable phenomena.

The achievement of a stalemate in the Sino-Japanese war is by no means accidental or lucky, but rather the price paid by countless lives, property, blood, sweat, and energy of the military and civilians over nearly three years. If we recall the astonishing consumption of human and material resources and the great sacrifices made by the front and rear in these three years, we will immediately gain a deep understanding of this stalemate and feel that it is extremely precious. The so-called stalemate is balance, not stillness; it is achieved through combat efforts and can only be maintained with continued effort. People must never regard this stalemate stage as an opportunity to take a breather and slack off, or even take the opportunity to develop personal desires and make a fortune from the national crisis. Instead, they should take advantage of the relative stability of the war situation to step up the construction of the rear, enrich their strength, and strive to complete the great cause of the war of resistance as early as possible. The tasks in this stage may be more difficult, more arduous, and more important than in the early stages of the war; because at the time of the initial resistance, one side was subjected to a sudden invasion, and people were busy saving the dying, while the other side was under the control of intense emotions, and everyone's spirit was easily lifted, so it was not easy for other problems to arise. As the war gradually became deadlocked, the foundation for the resistance and construction became established due to past efforts, but the internal and external environments became more complex than in the past, and difficult problems came from all directions, then it is necessary to have a clear understanding, firm perseverance, and a thorough determination to sacrifice in order to develop the great cause of resistance and construction to a higher stage, so as not to lose all previous efforts due to negligence and laxity.

Now that the war has reached this point, some familiar basic concepts seem to no longer need to be repeated, but these concepts must be kept in mind at all times and used as the standard for all personal actions. For example, the rampant speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, despite the criticism of public opinion and the prohibition of laws and regulations, is still rampant and without end. The losses it has caused to the national economy and people's livelihood are understood by everyone, and the harm it has caused to social morality may be even greater. Although most of these people are those who see profit and forget righteousness, there may also be some enlightened people who are simply blinded by temporary personal desires and attempt to escape from the general hardship of life to seek security for personal well-being. However, they do not know that personal interests and national interests are as interdependent as a carriage and its wheel. Personal well-being can only be solved in the overall problem, and only the nation is a strong guarantee for all personal happiness and property. It is already utterly confused to consider personal interests separately from national interests, let alone to plan for personal wealth by eroding the nation and society. Even if they succeed in taking risks and escape the national law and social sanctions for a time, there will inevitably be a day when they reap the consequences. If these people could slightly consider the well-being of the nation and their compatriots, then they would not be able to engage in such illegal profit-making activities with peace of mind! Another example is the so-called friction problem, which has caused concern to many people and has been used by the Japanese puppets as an excuse for slander. In fact, this problem is at most a local neglect of the primary importance of sincere unity, and the energy is spent outside of the current main task. It is neither as serious as the rumors from outside suggest, and it has already been resolved satisfactorily. As long as people can deeply understand that the principle of unity is inseparable from the great cause of resistance and construction, then they will be able to trust that the anti-Japanese camp is indestructible and will not be broken by a few minor issues. The British, French, and Poles can fight side by side for the same goal. Is it possible that the Chinese nation, at a time when the dawn of victory is already visible, is not as united as the Allied countries? Even if there are differences in thought and discrepancies in views, it is easy to find an ideal way out under the highest principles of national supremacy and national supremacy, and it will never affect the implementation of the task of resistance and construction. Since the start of the war of resistance, military progress has been rapid, while politics has been relatively slow. This is a fact; people should urgently catch up to this weakness and never easily believe in slander and shake their own beliefs.

The future of the war of resistance is bright, but in the long-term stalemate, the Chinese people cannot but endure temporary suffering. "There will be ten times or twenty times more difficult days in the future," this announcement should be noted and remembered by everyone. This difficulty can only be faced bravely, and only by solving the fundamental problem can all plans for personal gain be futile and sinful. The suffering that people encounter is nothing more than torment that can be endured by gritting their teeth, and what they will gain in exchange will be the liberation and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

### American Scientific Community Discovers New Application of Atomic Energy: Extracts "U-235" from Uranium, Can Be Used to Replace Submarine Fuel

New York, the New York Times recently reported that uranium is one of the chemical metallic elements with an atomic weight of 238.2. Professor Nier of the University of Minnesota, Professor Dunning of Columbia University, Professor Bohr of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark (Nobel Prize winner in Physics), and Professor Fermi of Italy (also a Nobel Prize winner in Physics) recently extracted a metal with an atomic weight of 235 from uranium, named "U-235." Its internal atomic power is extremely strong. It is estimated that each kilogram of "U-235" emits heat equivalent to 5,000 tons of coal. If a submarine is equipped with 23 kilograms of "U-235," it can sail indefinitely without needing to refuel. This discovery has greatly shocked the American scientific community and could have a huge impact on the current war in Europe. According to reliable sources, the German government has ordered several of the country's leading scientists and experts to study this problem. It is also reported that several physics professors at Columbia University have invented a method for applying the internal atomic power of "U-235." Scientific circles predict that "U-235" can be industrially produced within a few months, with its output measured in grams or kilograms. Every 139 kilograms of uranium contains 1 kilogram of "U-235." It is reported that the largest producing areas are the Belgian Congo in Africa, the Dominion of Canada, the State of Colorado in the United States, and both Britain and Germany.

Rome, the editor of the Fascist Party newspaper "Mannuccielli Bao" recently published an article in the newspaper, stating that after Britain's defeat in Norway, it is now stirring up trouble in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. However, whoever ignites the flames of war there will reap the fruits of their own destruction. In view of the increasingly dangerous British attitude towards Italy, Italy should fulfill its obligation to defend its territory. The Italian people have already felt the threat of war in effect and have suffered from the brutal reaction of Germany's enemies in economic terms. The Italian people also know that the realization of their natural aspirations is closely related to the current war. To seek a solution to the war, Italy must also participate in it. From the experience gained in the Abyssinian war, Italy has already known the difference between enemies and friends. (Haitong, 5th dispatch)

Rome, the Fascist Party branch in Milan recently held a symposium. In addition to the attendance of many veteran party members, several student representatives also participated. The speech delivered by Prime Minister Mussolini on March 26th of last year, which first publicly mentioned Italy's aspirations for France, was brought up for discussion. Participants unanimously expressed their approval and seized the opportunity to fiercely criticize Britain and France. According to the Italian People's Daily, in addition to expressing enthusiastic support for the Prime Minister's speech, all participants showed hostility towards Britain and France.

### Jiang Tingfu Broadcasts to Britain and America: Advocates Continued British and American Aid to Chinese Legal Tender

Chongqing, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Dr. Jiang Tingfu, broadcast a speech to Britain and the United States this morning, requesting them to continue providing assistance to China's monetary system. Dr. Jiang pointed out the current major economic problems in China and the abnormality of China's international trade, believing that Britain and the United States should take measures to stop trade with Japan, so that Japan cannot use it to increase its ability to invade China. Dr. Jiang stated that the imbalance in trade has made it difficult to balance China's international payments, eventually weakening the position of Chinese legal tender. China itself should strive to overcome these difficulties, but China's allies should also provide great assistance. Actively supporting Chinese legal tender is currently an extremely important issue in the entire Far Eastern situation. China's economy is mainly based on agriculture, and its relationship to China's strength or weakness is very great. No matter how much the Japanese intensify their blockade of China, China can still be self-sufficient in food. The government provides economic and technical assistance to farmers because the farmers respond to the government in this way. China's allies should believe that Japan will never be able to force China to submit. We will continue to bleed, and the blood of our economy is Chinese legal tender. Can China's allies provide assistance to the blood of our economy? (United Press, 5th dispatch)

### Presidents of Two Japanese Parties Plan to Form New Party

Tokyo, according to Japanese sources, Hisahara, president of the orthodox Seiyukai Party, visited Machida, president of the Minseito Party, yesterday, requesting cooperation in the movement to organize a new political party in order to revise and adjust the political status quo. It is reported that Machida expressed that in principle he does not oppose Hisahara's proposal, but he prefers that existing political parties cooperate more closely to adjust the political status quo and does not agree to disbanding the old parties and forming a new party. It is reported that in order to persuade Machida to accept his proposal, Hisahara pointed out that since the Manchurian Incident, existing political parties have engaged in closer cooperation under the advocacy of Yamamoto, but the results have proven that their strength is too weak to overcome the current situation. Therefore, he strongly stated the urgent need for a unified goal and consolidation of various political parties. The public is paying close attention to Hisahara's actions. (Reuters, 5th dispatch)

### Britain, France, and Italy Intensify Military Preparations: War Clouds Envelop Mediterranean: Italy Completes National Defense Measures: Allied Fleet Continues to Concentrate

Rome, the government promulgated an order today approving the Ministry of the Army to use an additional 800 million lire (Italian currency) to strengthen the army, half of which can be used within the current fiscal year, and the other half will be reserved for the next year. (Havas, 4th dispatch)

Rome, war clouds have recently spread across the Mediterranean. Italy completed its national defense measures yesterday. These measures include instructions authorizing the War Department 800 million lire (Italian currency) for "emergency measures" for national defense. This instruction was signed by Prime Minister Mussolini and King Emmanuel. At the same time, the Italian government instructed Fascist newspapers to warn the Allies that 8 million Italian soldiers and 340 warships are ready to act if the war extends to the Mediterranean. Recently, the Holy See has prepared to accommodate diplomatic personnel from countries at war with Italy within the Vatican industrial area, as recognized by the Holy See. Roman newspapers, when discussing the concentration of Allied warships in Alexandria, Egypt, said that the Allied navies in the Mediterranean include the French fleet and three British battleships and two cruisers that are currently heading to Alexandria, one of which is the HMS Waspi, which is reported to have arrived in the Mediterranean yesterday. Also, the French cruisers Dunkerque and Strasbourg are currently in Iran. Seven light squadrons and four heavy squadrons of British destroyers, along with several submarines, are scattered throughout the eastern Mediterranean. At this time, authoritative sources claim that they cannot confirm or deny reports that Italian troops have been concentrated on the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea, as this concerns military intelligence. However, they also said that these reports may be exaggerated, as Italy already has a very strong military presence on the island during peacetime. (United Press, 4th dispatch)

Paris, diplomatic observers here recently stated that the countries along the Mediterranean coast were originally concerned about being drawn into the whirlpool of war. Now that they have heard that the British and French fleets have sailed to Alexandria, Egypt, and that the second batch of warships has also entered the Mediterranean, they have all been comforted. The reason why the countries of Southeastern Europe feel uneasy is that the Italian fleet has concentrated on the Italian island of Dodecanese in the eastern Mediterranean and can attack the coast of Greece at any time, especially the port of Salonika. At the same time, Italian troops are also gathering in Albania and can invade Greece or Yugoslavia. Now that the British and French fleets have arrived in the eastern Mediterranean, the situation has become clearer. In addition, the new French Minister to Bulgaria, Bloomtale, has provided assurances to King Boris of Bulgaria, stating that France has no other intention for Southeastern Europe other than maintaining peace. The United States Ambassador to Italy, Phillips, has also made representations to the Italian authorities. All of this is enough to ease the situation in the Mediterranean. As for Spain, based on various facts, it is clear that the country knows where its interests lie and does not want to help Germany in the war, nor does it want to openly advocate for Germany.

Turkey Denies Concentration of Troops in Near East: Exerts Efforts to Maintain Status Quo in Mediterranean

Ankara, Turkish newspapers report that the arrival of the British and French naval fleets in Alexandria has greatly increased tensions in the Mediterranean. Officials here solemnly pointed out that Turkey should do its best to maintain the original state of affairs in the Mediterranean. The official here has categorically denied foreign newspapers' reports that Turkish troops are concentrated on the Asia Minor border, dismissing them as absurd. (Haitong, 5th dispatch)

Istanbul, Turkish General Sabis, who retired yesterday, boldly criticized the Allied operational policies in the "Afluga Bao," which is the first time since the signing of the Anglo-French-Turkish tripartite alliance. General Sabis said that Germany grasped the advantage in Europe at the beginning of the war and criticized the Allies for "lacking the determination and perseverance to fight." (United Press, 5th dispatch)

Eight Million Italian Soldiers Stand Ready: Roman Newspapers Boast of Strong Defense

Rome, the inflammatory Fascist newspaper "Tiviera Bao" stated yesterday that from a military perspective, Italy should be regarded as impeccable, for seven reasons. The newspaper said that eight million Italian soldiers are currently standing ready. "Italy is absolutely impeccable. There is no doubt that none of the British and French shells will fall on our industry or coastal cities." The seven reasons presented by the newspaper are as follows: (1) The Adriatic Sea is a blocked sea. (2) One hundred and twenty-one Italian submarines form a continuous iron chain to protect the Wottlandtuo Strait, which starts from the Ligurian coast in northwestern Italy and reaches the mouth of the Adriatic Sea. (3) The Tyrrhenian Sea is surrounded by powerful airfields and patrolled by the Italian Air Force. (4) From the Ionian Sea (part of the Mediterranean between Greece and Italy) to the Tyrrhenian Sea, there are a total of six battleships, thirty-three cruisers, one hundred and eighteen destroyers, and sixty-two torpedo boats. (5) The Italian island of Pantelleria between Sicily and Tunisia can cut off the enemy's military power. (6) Italy's coastal defense is substantial. (7) Eight million bayonets have been raised within Italian territory. (United Press, 5th dispatch)

### Roman Pope Broadcasts: Prays for Arrival of Time for Peace: US Ambassador to Italy Consults with Taylor: Appears Related to Mediation of European Peace

Rome, today the Pope preached in the Church of Minerva in Rome, which was broadcast by Italian radio, stating that the time for all Italian people to pray for peace in this turbulent era has now arrived. (Reuters, 5th dispatch)

Rome, Italian Crown Prince Bigzhong is scheduled to visit Pope Pius XII tomorrow. (Havas, 5th dispatch)

Rome, US Ambassador to Italy Phillips and Taylor, President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, consulted once yesterday while spending the weekend together at the Villa Sifanoia in Florence. Well-informed sources believe that the consultation between Phillips and Taylor must have been to discuss the issue of European peace, or even to discuss any peace plan. However, people close to the US Embassy said that Phillips and Taylor were only spending a relaxing weekend there and that there was no political significance. (United Press, 5th dispatch)

### Britain Still Seeks Understanding with Italy: To Turn Hostility into Friendship

Amsterdam, London reports that British political figures pointed out this morning that Britain is making every effort to contact Italy in an attempt to reach an understanding. Regarding restrictions on wartime trade, it is proposed to give as much consideration as possible to Italy's position in the Mediterranean. The Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal are now under the control of the Anglo-French Allied Forces, but Britain and France are treating Italian ships heading to Italy differently. The increased deployment of British and French navies into the Mediterranean is not an act of provocation towards Italy, but is due to the fact that Italian newspapers intend to systematically attack Britain and France. British political figures also mentioned Carl's paper published in the Sunday Times today. Carl speculated that Mussolini must have carefully considered the disadvantages of declaring war, such as the danger of Italy's mainland and Italian East African colonies being cut off, the possibility that the Holy See and the United States would have negative reactions to Italy's declaration of war, and the parallel interests of Britain and Italy in the Balkans, which would all make Mussolini unwilling to rashly start a war. (Haitong, 5th dispatch)

### Whether Italy Will Participate in the War: Wales Dares Not Make a Lighthearted Statement: US Officials Are Actually Gambling Money

Washington, yesterday, officials were gambling money on whether Italy would join the European war in the near future. Undersecretary of State Wales told the press that he could not comment on whether the European war would expand, and said that he could not guarantee that the situation (even after Friday) would not change. Senior officials from the State Department expressed silence on the development of the Mediterranean. Recently, the American ship Washington left New York for Genoa with 227 passengers. The ship was delayed for two hours waiting for four important packages from Washington. (United Press, 5th dispatch)

Washington, when Undersecretary of State Wales received newspaper reporters today, one reporter asked whether there had been any changes in the European situation since yesterday. After hesitating for a moment, Undersecretary of State Wales replied that the European situation was precarious and difficult to judge. It is reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini provided assurances to US Ambassador to Italy Phillips a few days ago, stating that the country is determined to pursue peace. The fact that the United States government did not express comfort because of this guarantee makes Undersecretary of State Wales' answer the first time. Then, a reporter asked whether there were signs that the European war would expand to other countries in the short term. Undersecretary of State Wales refused to answer. (Havas, 4th dispatch)

### Spain Declares: Maintain Neutrality

Saint Joannes de Luz, according to a memorandum issued by the Spanish Consul here, Spain solemnly declared that it is willing to maintain its neutrality in the current war. It is reported that this memorandum was issued by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior, stating that external rumors that German aircraft flying over southwestern France took off from Spanish territory are absurd. The Spanish government's major interest is to try to prevent all efforts that undermine Franco-Spanish harmony. Moreover, due to its geographical position, Spain has no choice but to put aside all facts that could endanger its sincere neutral emotions. (Reuters, 5th dispatch)

### Malta: British Troops Inspected: Will Go to the Front Line to Fight

### British Wartime Cabinet to be Thoroughly Reorganized; House of Commons Scheduled to Debate the War Situation Tomorrow; Current Government Faces Strong Domestic Criticism

London - The House of Commons is scheduled to debate the Norwegian campaign on the 7th of this month. At that time, opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee and opposition Liberal Party leader Sinclair will certainly attack the government. Others, such as former Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, former First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper, former Prime Minister Lloyd George of the Liberal Party, and members of Parliament like Macmillan, Godfrey Nicholson, and others, will also criticize the current policies of the government. It is expected among parliamentary circles that these members of parliament will, in principle, express their approval of the Norwegian campaign, but will demand that the government continue to send expeditionary forces to fight with the greatest determination. At the same time, they will also severely criticize the government's past actions in dealing with the North European war. The general impression seems to be that the lack of "momentum" in the government's current policies is not the fault of Prime Minister Chamberlain, but rather the fault of those around him. Morrison, a Labour Party member and chairman of the London City Council, gave a speech today, saying that the Labour Party will never join a Chamberlain-Simon-Hoare cabinet, so without a thorough reorganization of the current cabinet, there is no possibility of establishing a truly nationally unified cabinet. In short, when the House of Commons meets on the 7th of this month, a motion of confidence in the government will be put to a vote, which is a rare occurrence during wartime. What the views of the House of Commons ultimately are can be seen in the outcome of this vote. What can be said now is that some members of parliament believe that the government should not only implement more decisive policies, but also expand the base of the cabinet and innovate its membership. Recently, this kind of proposal has become increasingly powerful, so the issue of a thorough reorganization of the cabinet may become more concrete in the middle of this month. (Havas, 4th)

London - A Reuters reporter in the House of Commons lobby claimed that although the overall situation still depends on the strength of the government's statement in the House of Commons on Tuesday, there are currently two new reasons to improve the situation. Last Friday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon stated that the cabinet had no differences of opinion on the Norwegian issue, which has dispelled one of the hopes of those attacking the government, namely that if First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill and the navy had not been constrained by the Prime Minister and the majority of the cabinet, the situation in Trondheim would have been better than what has been achieved. Based on the information available so far, this observation does not seem to be based on facts, so the prospect of Churchill being the vanguard of a new war policy or even a new cabinet has now waned. The second reason is the freedom of neutral countries to express their opinions. They said that although the Allied countries have given up Norway, they will not abandon any other neutral countries that relied on the Allied countries after the outbreak of the war. Although the cabinet has a consistent opinion on the Norwegian issue, the House of Commons can still force the government to make slight changes to its personnel or policies, but if it is beneficial, the House of Commons will also unite to support the government more quickly. Neutral commentators among members of parliament are now very indignant, because the only information they have obtained makes them believe that the only reason the Allied forces did not arrive on the Scandinavian Peninsula before the German forces was that the Allied countries respected the neutrality of Scandinavia during and after the Soviet-Finnish War, and lacked the necessary preparedness to link with this policy. Many members of parliament originally wanted to know on Tuesday whether the same situation would occur if other regions were drawn into the war, so a part of the House of Commons may launch a strong attack on government personnel, but if the government presents the difficulties of Norway in more detail than has been possible so far, coupled with the general indignation that neutral commentators have revealed, then the House of Commons, even if there are real reasons for criticism at that time, will not be too harsh on the government, and will only give warnings that some points of dissatisfaction must be remedied. As for leaving the political situation as it is for the time being, this may be the result of the House of Commons' two-day debate. However, if the opposition party is found to be willing to accept the long-standing invitation to join the government during the debate, the situation will inevitably change greatly. (Reuters, 5th)

London - After the British government announced the withdrawal of Allied troops from the Namsos area of Norway, the severe criticism of Prime Minister Chamberlain across the country intensified. The Manchester Guardian attacked Chamberlain, saying, "His ability to deceive himself will be a danger to the country." The Daily Mirror declared, "Chamberlain is an expert in explaining failures; he has achieved almost nothing since the Munich Conference." Public opinion suspects that the British leader deceived himself about Hitler's strategic strength in suddenly seizing Norway and Denmark, and miscalculated the difficulties of the Allied expedition and the skills of the German army. Most people still remember that First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill's description of the German invasion of Norway and Denmark was a major historical mistake. Churchill even boasted that Britain could do whatever it wanted on the Norwegian coast. Judging from what has been encountered, the general feeling is that the government knew almost nothing about the development of the situation in Norway. The Allied forces now seem to want to drive the German forces out of the Narvik area in order to control northern Norway, but according to military observers in the interim, even if the Allied forces can achieve their goal, in addition to placing a restraint on Germany that has no major effect, Narvik cannot be used as a suitable base, because the Allied base in Narvik is 300 miles away from Trondheim, separated by mountains, and there is almost no transportation infrastructure. It is now generally believed that the German forces can consolidate the ports and air force bases in the newly occupied parts of Norway, and will launch a large-scale bombing of the Narvik area. The Allied forces in the Narvik area still do not have suitable airfields for rapid fighter planes. Military observers here believe that the possibility of the Allied forces driving the German forces out of Norway is "almost hopeless." (United Press, 5th)

### Mexican Oil Dispute; U.S. Suggestion Rejected

Washington - Regarding the dispute over the Mexican government's nationalization of American oil mines, the U.S. government sent a document to Mexico, proposing that the matter be submitted to international arbitration. The Mexican government recently sent a reply to U.S. Ambassador Daniels, firmly rejecting the U.S. suggestion, saying that this matter is a domestic affair of our country, and our government will be able to resolve it soon. It is inconvenient for us to accept the suggestion put forward by your government. (Havas, 4th)

Washington - The Mexican government's note to the United States refusing the U.S. request to submit the two-year-old oil expropriation case to arbitration stated that the case was purely domestic in nature and that the request to submit it to arbitration was inconsistent with the facts and international law. A solution has already been reached with Sinclair Oil, and other U.S. oil companies can also obtain the same solution. (Reuters, 4th)

### Leader of the British Labour Party Opposition Advocates Intensifying the War, Saying the British Nation Never Retreats in the Face of Difficulties

London Air Dispatch - Major Attlee, leader of the Labour Party opposition in the British House of Commons, recently wrote that the heroic resistance of the Finnish nation against aggression finally ended in a tragic ending. This is undoubtedly a setback for Britain and France in upholding justice, and a setback for civilization. Although Britain and France were not directly involved in the vortex of the Soviet-Finnish War, the Finnish nation's resistance to aggression and the maintenance of moral principles in international relations were fought for Britain and France. For nine years, the aggressive countries have committed acts that have disrupted world peace one after another. The Soviet Union's invasion of Finland is the most recent one. Each time such an act of aggression occurs, the civilized countries of the world express sympathy for the aggressed, but have not provided practical assistance. Occasionally, they provide assistance, but it is too late and does no good. If we do not forget the word "restraint" for the aggressors, then we very much hope that we will no longer hear the painful phrase "rescue is too late." Britain has extreme sympathy for Finland, but there are various geographical difficulties. In terms of public opinion, it is also quite against war with the Soviet Union, and the general opinion is only to defeat Hitler as the main goal, and it demands to intensify the war to implement this goal. Some critics may ask why Britain has long allowed the enemy to be in a preemptive position. The answer is that Hitler has been actively preparing for war since he came to power, so he can wait for the opportunity to act. However, as far as Britain is concerned, the stagnation of the main land battle has lasted for six months, and we have also had a good opportunity to reform the national economic structure to make it suitable for wartime conditions. Even now, there is still no one who advocates that Britain should launch a hasty attack on the German Siegfried Line, but everyone believes that it is necessary to take the initiative, because sitting back and watching the situation will ultimately not lead to victory. Looking at the overall war situation, the navies of Britain and France have been able to control the seas, and the excellence of the air force has also been fully demonstrated. Only the army has not yet distinguished itself. Or it may be thought that Britain still has diplomatic and economic avenues to follow, or is it really unable to do anything? It is important to know that Hitler threatens and lures the neutral countries of Europe, trying to make them submit. This is what Britain and France must not sit idly by and watch, and they should fully use their great financial resources to assist these countries so that they are not used by Germany. It is true that the blockade of Germany by Britain and France is an effective policy, but its full effect must be seen after the German side is forced to consume its resources. Indeed, in terms of national potential, Germany is far inferior to Britain and France, but it will take some time for Germany to consume, and Britain and France must also make full use of their potential to be effective. Furthermore, in terms of the internal situation in Britain, the government's urgent tasks are two: to intensify the command of the war and to improve administrative efficiency. Although the wartime cabinet has been formed, its foundation is not sound, so it has already aroused controversy. Since the enemy intends to use all its strength to win the victory, it is not enough for Britain to continue its appeasement tactics to cope with the current situation. It is originally deeply believed by us that the methods used by Britain and France based on democratic traditions will certainly be superior to the means used by dictators. However, this method must be fully implemented to be effective. In order to support the war effort, maintain the people's living conditions, and supply domestic consumption, national production must be greatly increased, and foreign trade must also be vigorously developed. However, in order to achieve this goal, all resources must be fully utilized. At the same time, attention must be paid to manpower and land. There are indeed many young men in our country who have joined the army, but there are still many unemployed people in the country. If those who already have jobs can be used more appropriately, the effectiveness will certainly be greater. As for the land that has not been reclaimed, that has not been fully reclaimed, and there are also some mines that can be re-exploited. If we are committed to this, not only can unemployed miners be employed, but also multiple benefits can be achieved in one fell swoop. All of this requires the government to design and guide, so that expenses can be reduced and production can be increased. The people of our country are determined to win the victory, so they will certainly be happy to obey the government's various measures. Moreover, the extreme importance of production during wartime should also be understood by the people, so those who work in unimportant occupations in peacetime and whose annual income is as high as £1,000, if they can produce £200 worth of food during this wartime, their contribution will be even greater. In a rich and culturally developed society, such changes are indeed difficult, and the importance of not repeating them is self-evident. The wartime Prime Minister must severely punish those officials who are derelict in their duties, and if any cabinet members are not up to the task, they must be dismissed immediately, because administrative corruption is most likely to undermine morale. Regarding the strength used by Britain, critics often underestimate it. Non-maritime people often do not know the greatness of our country's fleet and merchant ship strength, and they do not know the strength of the pressure we exert at sea. Moreover, today's our country, in addition to the navy, has rapidly formed a powerful army and air force, and the rear has a strong economic structure, so that the soldiers at the front and the people in the rear can be confident and fearless. Based on this, the demands from all parties to intensify the war and take the initiative are by no means due to anxiety about the protracted war, which leads to weakness. On the contrary, it proves that we have the determination. The British nation knows that what it has to deal with is to save the crisis of civilization, and it will never retreat in the face of difficulties. This can be asserted.

### 1940 Soviet National Budget; Both Revenue and Expenditure Increase Sharply

TASS Special Dispatch - The Soviet Union's national budget for 1940 has been approved by the Sixth Congress of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The budget guarantees the continued development of the national economy and the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. According to the budget, revenue is 183,954,633,000 rubles, and expenditure is 179,913,376,000 rubles. Compared with 1939, revenue increased by 28,000,000,000 rubles, and expenditure increased by 26,000,000,000 rubles. In terms of revenue, the main source is trade tax, which accounts for 108,609,000,000 rubles, and profit tax from state-owned enterprises accounts for 23,431,000,000 rubles, an increase of 12.1% (this is due to the sharp increase in production). As for profit tax, this year also increased by 45% compared to last year (this is due to the reduction in production costs and the increase in production). In terms of taxes paid by the people, it only accounts for 5.3% of the total revenue. National bonds are very popular among the people. Currently, 50 million Soviet people hold national bonds. The number of people purchasing national bonds increases every year, and it must exceed the original quota. For example, the second five-year plan bond was purchased by the people for 1,637,000,000 rubles last year, exceeding the purchase amount in 1938 by 29%. In terms of expenditure, most of it is used for economic development. A total of 36,000,000,000 rubles is used for the construction of major industries, and the investment amount in the national economy reaches 57,200,000,000 rubles. In addition, 13,500,000,000 rubles is used for agriculture, 57,000,000,000 rubles is used for national defense, and 43,000,000,000 rubles is used for cultural undertakings, accounting for 24% of the total expenditure. 9,800,000,000 rubles is used for health and sports, and 7,800,000,000 rubles is used for the welfare of the working masses. As for the budgets of the various republics, this year also increased by 8.7% compared to last year. Among them, 200 million rubles is used for the cultural and economic development of western Ukraine and Belarus.

### British, French, and Norwegian Allied Forces Reassemble; German Forces Suffer Setbacks in Narvik; German Mechanized Units Entered Namsos Yesterday; German Reinforcements Continuously Arriving in Norway by Sea and Air

Paris - According to military sources here, the reassembly of British, French, and Norwegian troops in Norway continues without any surprises. The situation in Narvik is gradually becoming clear. Allied troops are gradually making contact with German forces. Yesterday, German planes participated in the battle in the area for the first time, bombing a village north of the city. (Reuters, 5th)

Paris - Well-informed sources recently declared that the withdrawal of British and French Allied forces from central Norway is now being reconfigured, and the process is going smoothly. Norwegian troops are still working closely with the Allied forces. The military authorities of that country have never entered into a ceasefire agreement with the German side. Only a few isolated troops, such as those fighting northeast of Bergen, had no choice but to surrender to the German forces due to a lack of arms. As for the Narvik area in the north, although the terrain is rugged and the climate is poor, the Allied forces have been quite successful in their operations. According to reliable sources, there are only about 3,000 German soldiers in the area, 1,000 of whom are now occupying the railway line from Narvik to Sweden, occupying several bridges and caves. The remaining troops are still stubbornly resisting near the port of Narvik. The Allied forces are fiercely bombarding them with heavy artillery and naval guns. (Havas, 5th)

Stockholm, Sweden - According to the Swedish newspaper "Dagens Nyheter," a large number of Norwegian troops in the Namsos and Åndalsnes areas were forced to board British ships and sail to the Narvik area to fight. Regarding whether British expeditionary forces have landed in northern Norway, there is no way to obtain confirmed news here. (Haitong, 5th)

London - The British Broadcasting Corporation's radio station broadcast a message at 7:00 p.m. today, saying that German troops in the Narvik area of northern Norway have been defeated by the Allied forces and are retreating to the northeast of the port. The port has been destroyed and the scene is extremely desolate. The German forces seem to be concentrating along the coast. In the Austdal River valley, Norwegian troops have repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the German forces, and they are currently fighting fiercely near Kiranger. (Havas, 4th)

Stockholm, Sweden - According to today's Swedish newspapers, German motorized units have now arrived in Namsos and are continuing to advance north without encountering any resistance. The city of Verdal is already occupied by the German forces. According to news from the Trondelag area, the fighting in the area ended yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

Stockholm, Sweden - A correspondent for the "Aftonbladet" newspaper reported from the Norwegian border last night that German motorized units have left Stenkjer and are heading north along the road on the west bank of Lake Snåsavatnet. Their purpose is to attack the town of Snåsa at the far north of the lake. According to German sources from Gothenburg, German troops and supplies are still being transported to Norway in a continuous stream, using ships and airplanes as means of transportation. Recently, 50 transport planes were seen flying north in one day, and 14 transport ships escorted by warships were discovered on the Swedish sea. (United Press, 4th)

Stockholm, Sweden - The Norwegian army, which recovered Røros on Tuesday, has now driven the German forces to Tynset, 28 miles south of Røros. This news has been confirmed by several sources. It is heard that the German forces have retreated after fighting in Voss and along the railway line. The commander of the Norwegian army in Røros told a reporter yesterday that in any case, he is determined to defend the Røros area and prevent German forces from approaching the border. (Reuters, 5th)

Stockholm, Sweden - The Allied troop embarkation at Namsos was completed at 3:00 a.m. on Friday. Namsos was completely destroyed by German bombers. Two British warships had to anchor in the bay. The withdrawing soldiers departed in batches on fishing boats and Norwegian boats. It took the entire day on Thursday for everyone to board the ships. (Reuters, 5th)

Stockholm, Sweden - The Norwegian semi-official news agency, the Telegraph Agency, recently issued a message stating that the Norwegian headquarters has been moved to a city in the north. Although the German authorities have ordered demobilization in order to "pacify" southern Norway, the general mobilization order issued by the legitimate Norwegian government is still in effect. (Havas, 4th)

### German War Report

Berlin - The German High Command issued a war report today, stating that enemy forces, under the cover of aircraft, have repeatedly attacked our army's positions north of Narvik, and the results have been repelled by the combined bombers.

Berlin - German planes sank a British cruiser near Namsos. At that time, German planes bombed the British fleet amidst intense anti-aircraft fire, hitting a British warship, which caught fire and smoked. After the smoke cleared, German planes flew to the area to inspect and saw many various fragments, and there was oil floating on the sea. The British warship sank within minutes. (Haitong, 5th)

Brussels - An air raid alert was issued three times in northern France on the 3rd, and the anti-aircraft artillery units also fired fiercely, but they failed to shoot down any enemy planes. (Haitong, 5th)

London - Reliable sources in London claim that the news released by the German side that two British cruisers were sunk is completely false. The Admiralty here announced that only three British submarines were lost in the Norwegian sea. As for other British losses, there is no confirmed news so far. (Reuters, 5th)

Berlin - The German news agency recently claimed that on May 3, in addition to one British battleship west of Namsos being sunk by German planes, two British cruisers, one destroyer, and one transport ship were also hit and sunk by German bombs in the Norwegian sea. In addition, two British cruisers, one destroyer, and one transport ship were also seriously damaged. Since the start of the Norwegian war, a total of 23 British submarines have been lost. (Reuters, 5th)

London - The claim made by the German side that one British "Queen Elizabeth"-class battleship, with a displacement of 31,000 tons, was sunk yesterday has been firmly denied here. (Havas News Agency, 5th)

### Norwegian Foreign and Defense Ministers Arrived in London Yesterday

London - Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht and Colonel Colonel, the Minister of Defence, arrived at 6:50 a.m. today and will hold talks with British government officials. (Havas News Agency, 5th)

### Gloomy Situation in the London Market

London: Although the news of British troops withdrawing from northern Norway and the tense situation in the Mediterranean only affected the decline in foreign bond prices in the London market, the market situation has become gloomy. Bulgarian and Greek bonds have weakened, Italian 7% bonds have fallen to £48, and Egyptian unified bonds have fallen to £72. The most popular situation in London now is the active selling of Japanese bonds, possibly due to the impact of the Dutch East Indies issue. Tokyo's 5.5% bonds have now fallen to £44. As for US government bonds, they have not been affected by the adverse news due to the efforts of Finance Minister Simon. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

### Britain Launches Diplomatic Offensive in the Balkans. British Ambassador to Turkey Meets Bulgarian King. Seeks to Foster Turkish-Bulgarian Reconciliation and Cooperation.

Sofia: King Boris III of Bulgaria received British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, this afternoon for discussions. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

Ankara: Rumors that the German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, has returned to Germany are not true. Ambassador Papen is still here and is expected to return to Germany in the next few days to report to Führer Hitler, and then return to his post after staying for two or three days. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

Rome: The semi-official Stefani News Agency issued a telegram from the Bulgarian capital, revealing the background of Britain's intensified diplomatic activities in the Balkan capitals. It is claimed that although the Allied diplomatic offensive in the Balkans seeks to use vague promises to grant Bulgaria the benefit of territorial revision, it has already encountered serious obstacles from Bulgaria. According to well-informed sources, the British Minister to Bulgaria has repeatedly notified the Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister that Bulgaria's demands for territorial revision will be fulfilled. Bulgaria's demands include not only Bessarabia from Romania, but also a direct access to the Aegean Sea. It is said that if Greece can agree to cede Dedeagach to Bulgaria, the demand for direct access to the Aegean Sea can be realized. The British promise to Bulgaria regarding the revision of its territory was made by the British Minister to Bulgaria to Bulgarian politicians after he had discussed British policy towards the Balkans with diplomatic leaders in London. The recent visit of the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, to Sofia is clearly related to the activities of the British Minister in Sofia. It is understood that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen informed the Bulgarian government of the Turkish government's willingness to resolve the issues between the two countries with Bulgaria. Turkey has also repeatedly hinted to Bulgarian politicians that it welcomes the resolution of various issues between them, but the Bulgarian authorities have expressed reservations about this and have not made a clear statement.

Fuzhou Dispatch: Fujian Province is the southeastern national defense frontline. Since the War of Resistance, it has been repeatedly subjected to Japanese air raids and naval bombardments. However, with the strict defense of the defending generals and the calm response of the people in the rear, the Japanese bombing strategy has ultimately failed. According to statistics from military agencies, from the outbreak of the War of Resistance to the end of October last year, the province suffered Japanese aircraft

Bombing Incidents

As reported by various county offices, there were a total of 526 incidents, involving 41 counties.

A total of 4,530 residential houses, 1,018 shops, 18 factories, 420 public places, and 140 other buildings were damaged, with property losses of approximately 7 million yuan. If analyzed

By County

Dongshan was the most frequently attacked, with 90 incidents. Longxi followed with 61 incidents, followed by Haicheng with 60 incidents, Fuzhou with 45 incidents, and Minhou, Jinjiang, and Lianjiang with more than 20 incidents each. Changle, Fuqing, Ningde, Putian, Nan'an, Yunxiao, Longyan, and Changting each had more than 10 incidents. In addition, all the other bombed counties had less than 10 incidents. Datian, Ninghua, Liancheng, Xiapu, Luoyuan, Fu'an, Yongtai, Shaxian, Pucheng, Jianyang, Nanjing, Changtai, and Shanghang counties each had no more than 3 incidents. The largest number of attacking Japanese aircraft and bombs dropped were in Dongshan, Longxi, Fuzhou, and Minhou. A total of 326 Japanese aircraft attacked Longxi, dropping 601 bombs.

In addition, coastal counties such as Changle, Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Ningde, Fuzhou, Hui'an, Putian, Nan'an, Kinmen, and Dongshan, in addition to being bombed by Japanese aircraft, were also frequently subjected to

Japanese Naval Harassment

Fuzhou has not been subjected to air raids since July 7 last year. Has the Japanese military's combat power declined?

### Increased Harvest of Winter Crops in Zhejiang. Estimated at Approximately 3 Million Dan.

Lishui Dispatch: The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute dispatched personnel last year to assist in urging the expansion of winter crop planting in 30 counties, including those under Lishui. As a result, the area planted with winter crops increased by 1,491,201 mu, of which wheat accounted for 37%, barley accounted for 25%, rapeseed accounted for 22%, legumes accounted for 7%, and others accounted for 9%.

The institute assisted in supervising the planned expansion of planting area of ​​1,397,000 mu in various counties, so the actual area exceeded the planned area by more than 54,200 mu. Although the statistical figures for the actual expansion area in other counties have not yet been seen, it is estimated that it should not be below the planned one. Then, the total expansion of the area planted with winter crops in the province last year should be more than 3.15 million mu. The harvest of winter crops this year is estimated to increase by more than 3 million dan.

### Chaoshan Chinese Troops Repeatedly Attack Chenghai. Killed Many Japanese and Puppet Troops. Extreme Chaos Near Shantou.

Shantou Dispatch: On April 16, the Japanese army in Chao'an, taking advantage of the stalemate in the battle of Anjie Road, moved infantry to the east bank of Xiangzi Bridge to cover the puppet pacification class's activities and propaganda in Dongjin, Zhuxiang, and Qiulangshan. They were greatly attacked by the Chinese army and civilians, resulting in more than 80 deaths and injuries. Many spies who sneaked into the Fujian border were also arrested by the Chinese. On the night of the 19th, Chenghai County Magistrate Li Shaoru sent security teams across the river to raid Chengcheng. The puppet army regiment of Wang Tiancai, entrenched in the northeast suburbs of Chengcheng, was suddenly besieged in Longtian, Xiapu, and Mazhou. More than 200 puppet troops suffered more than half of deaths and injuries, and the remaining fled into the city and defended themselves behind closed doors. At 00:40 on the 20th, the Chinese army broke through the north gate and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army in front of the Chengcheng Grandma Tree and the Chenghuang Temple, repeatedly charging and killing, and killed more than 150 puppet troops. At 5:00 a.m., Li's troops left the east gate and crossed the east bank of the Han River and left calmly. The Japanese army in Youtou heard that Chengcheng had been captured by the Chinese army and that there was a big fire in the city. Japanese aircraft hurriedly flew to Zhanglin and Donglong to偵察, opened fire and扫射 at the ground, and then退. On the 23rd, two more seaplanes flew to Zhanglin and Donglong to bomb, back and forth many times, and scattered absurd leaflets, saying that Rui Huang Dawei would attack southern Fujian, and that anyone who dared to resist would not be spared. Chenghai County Magistrate Li Shaoru then ordered the old, weak, women, and children in all villages to evacuate into the mountains of Raoping within three days, leaving the strong men to guard their homes and prepare to resist the puppet army. Zhanglin, Donglong, Jianzao in Chenghai, and Jingzhou, Xiaodong, Huanggang, Fushan, Zhalin, and Fenshuiguan in Raoping were all evacuated. At 9:00 a.m. that morning, the Japanese army's Chita Unit, together with more than 300 puppet troops of Huang Dawei of Chengcheng, crossed the river from the east gate and invaded Lianyang. Li Shaoru's troops immediately要击 them on the shore. At that time, the river was rising and turbulent, and the Japanese and puppet troops failed to land. Two ships had already been sunk. Japanese naval electric boats drove in from the north and south ports to reinforce, but were finally attacked and entered Lianyang. Fierce battles broke out in the market. The fierce battle lasted all day. Japanese planes flew from Shantou again to bomb, destroying many houses. By dusk, the Chinese Raoping reinforcements arrived and surrounded the Japanese army in Lanyang. The Japanese army was defeated, with more than 200 deaths and injuries and more than 50 corpses left behind. The Japanese relied on naval cover to cross the river and return to Chengcheng, almost completely wiped out. When the fierce battle in Lanyang was in full swing, the Chinese army in Sangpu Mountain, Wu Deze's division, dispatched light cavalry to raid Anbu and Baolong, besieging and殲滅 300 puppet troops in the area. It was heard that the puppet troops were wearing yellow uniforms with red cloths wrapped around their arms. They had just been transferred from Nanjing and Shanghai. Later, when the Japanese reinforcements arrived at Baolong, Wu's light cavalry had penetrated into Xiapu in Chenghai. At noon on the 23rd, the Chinese army surrounded Outing (this place is 15 li from Shantou), surrounding more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops. After a stalemate of two hours, more than half of the Japanese and puppet troops were歼滅. The Japanese army in Shantou also sent out 300 men in automobiles from the Shantou-Chenghai highway to rescue. The Chinese guerrillas took advantage of the situation to attack the automobiles with hand grenades in Huawu, Dongdun, and Jinsha in the suburbs of Shantou. The rumbling sound could be heard in Shantou. The Japanese and puppet officials in Shantou therefore fell into chaos, either boarding ships or fleeing to stores in Jiaoshi, Shalong, and Dahao West. Outing was nearby, with bombed automobiles堵塞往交通, and the Chinese army was able to fight until 8:00 p.m. before withdrawing somewhere. On the morning of the 27th, the Japanese and puppet troops in Chenghai, with the help of the Japanese navy,犯进 Zhanglin by waterway. The Chinese army ambushed on the opposite bank of Donglong and killed many Japanese troops.

### Fangjia Yao, Qingpu, Occupied by Japanese and Puppet Troops. Most of Those Kidnapped Died.

Qingpu Dispatch: After Fangjia Yao outside the east gate of Qingpu was disturbed, although the puppet maintenance committee did not appear, every large and small household had already hammered a small Japanese flag on the roof, otherwise they would be killed. Therefore, although the appearance seems calm, it is still very tense inside. All bridges, forks, and branch rivers are guarded by Japanese and puppet troops and plainclothes Japanese people carrying binoculars to watch. People entering and leaving are subject to strict inspections. Any delay will result in death. Even foreign missionaries are not exempt. Also, Pan Wuping, a resident of Xiaodongwei north of Fangjia Yao who was kidnapped, has now died. The commander of the Fifth Regiment, who was kidnapped earlier, has had his left wrist chopped off, but he has not yet been released. Also, a certain gentry in Wu Jia Wan has also died. Few men enter and leave the countryside these days, but women can still pass through. However, people often use the excuse of searching homes, and do all kinds of evil.

### Shortage of Coffins in Wuxi. Larger Poplar Trees All Chopped Down.

Wuxi Dispatch: The source of wood in Xiyi is lacking, and transportation is inconvenient, so the price is expensive. Although some people want to build houses, it is difficult to buy good wood. The most difficult thing is that the coffins used for the dead cost at least 30 to 40 yuan each. Now, in order to reduce the burden on the poor, the timber shops in the countryside have specially chopped down the larger poplar trees and turned them into coffins for sale, so that the beautiful poplar trees on the river bank and embankment have been chopped down.

### Letter to All Students in Shanghai from the University and Middle School Students' Association (2)

Today, of course, we must commemorate this great festival with the greatest enthusiasm. Although the environment in Shanghai is now more complex and worse, we are all convinced of ourselves, only our firm and unyielding confidence can overcome all difficulties, only our calm minds and collective strength can cope with the space shrouded by this evil force. Now that the great historical commemorative festival of our student community is approaching, what are our inner thoughts? What kind of attitude should we use to commemorate this Youth Day? The following are two points that we hope to share with all students in Shanghai on Youth Day:

First, we must work hard and encourage ourselves, clench our teeth, strictly guard our own posts, and constantly fight against the real environment. The duty of students is to study hard. With knowledge, we can contribute to the country and serve the society in the future. Now the War of Resistance is nearly three years old, and the day of final victory is getting closer and closer. The country will need young people like us to do the work of national rejuvenation in the future. We are very fortunate to be able to have books to read on this isolated island trampled by iron hooves. If we do not take this opportunity to seek some real knowledge, how will we have the ability to contribute to the country in the future? Although the environment in Shanghai is now very dangerous and difficult, as long as the school does not open, we can study with peace of mind. Studying is our basic work, studying is saving the country, and President Chiang Kai-shek also advises us to strictly guard our posts and study hard. Studying is to store talents for the country. We must not forget our own duties and do things beyond our duties. This does not mean that you should sit and read dead books, but we must always recognize the current environment. Rather than blindly following and moving around without helping the overall situation, it is better to work hard and encourage ourselves, clench our teeth, and strictly guard our own posts, and concentrate our efforts on studying. We believe that the day of victory in the War of Resistance is the day of our thorough liberation. Therefore, studying hard now is really the most appropriate way to fight against the environment, and it is also not disappointing the country's purpose of cultivating talents. Today is Youth Day, and we hope that everyone will encourage each other. Studying is fighting, and it is also saving the country. It must be known that war is a cruel elimination, and everything in the future is that we young people are expected to inherit the mission of resisting aggression and building the country in a new and metabolic way. It is to fulfill the cause of rejuvenating the nation. How do we commemorate Youth Day today? We must not forget our own responsibilities and missions, we should work hard at our studies, become a talent, and prepare to serve the country and society in the future.

### Lido Crushes Nanyang

In the match between Lido and Nanyang, Nanyang's two main forwards, Wan Jin and Luo Meihong, were unable to play due to injuries, greatly weakening their strength, leading to a one-sided game.

Soon after, Zhang Mingsheng scored on a penalty kick (2-0). Around the 30-minute mark, Nanyang's Li Liangtong intercepted Shen Shangde, and the high ball was passed back to the goalkeeper at the correct angle, flying into the right corner of the goal. Goalkeeper Zhu Zhongming jumped to save but was unable to reach it, resulting in an own goal. At the end of the first half, Lido remained sharp, scoring goal after goal.

Four minutes later, Fafan Xiao and Teweini also scored successively. Samsung lost five cities in half an hour, turning a 4-3 lead into a 4-8 disadvantage, which was truly unexpected.

### Jiangyin False Zhishi Replacement Suffered

Changyinsha Newsletter, Jiangyin false Zhishi He Peixuan, formerly due to mental disorder, was slow to proceed with the false regime under the supervision of the Japanese side, which caused great dissatisfaction from the Japanese side. Later, Lai Lantian, who was once active, wanted to continue any false position, and he tried his best to please the Japanese side. He set up checkpoints in the small ports along the North Outer River to impose taxes on passing ships and goods. The day before yesterday, Lai Lantian was suddenly captured by a mobile team in a certain place in Dongxiang and handed over to the headquarters for interrogation. His family is begging in every possible way, willing to redeem his sin with a lot of money. The mobile team said that the motive for capturing Lai was not money-oriented, and he must be punished according to the law. Therefore, the replacement of the false Zhishi will be temporarily reduced.

### Person in charge of the Silver and Money Industry said that the Restriction on Withdrawal and Deposit is Unfounded Shanghai Market Has Not Received Orders from the Ministry of Finance The strength of the firm is sufficient to cope with it

Since the Pingzhun Foreign Exchange Fund Committee restricted the supply of black market foreign exchange in Shanghai, HSBC, a British merchant, restricted the supply, so speculators in the Shanghai black market market took great action, causing rumors to spread, the market was chaotic, and the exchange rate shrank sharply. Later, the Chinese government declared that it would maintain the stability of the monetary system and had the determination to maintain foreign exchange, so the black market tended to stabilize and people's hearts were at ease. However, due to the trend of withdrawal and deposit in various firms in the market, there was a saying that the restriction on withdrawal and deposit would start on Monday (today). Yesterday, the committee of the Silver and Money Industry Association and the person in charge of the three banks of China and China expressed yesterday evening that the association and others had not received an order from the Ministry of Finance to restrict withdrawal and deposit again. The various rumors are unreliable.

### The Strength of the Firm is Extremely Abundant

After the war, the business of the silver and money industry paid attention to the guard and made special and cautious investments in all loans. In order to enhance its own strength and enable the general business beliefs to be restored as soon as possible, it adjusted the payment reserve of the two industries, that is, each firm provided property to the bank's joint reserve to receive new exchange plans, and the bank's joint reserve gradually exchanged the exchange funds originally owned by each firm into legal currency. After the implementation, the strength of each firm itself became more and more abundant, the financial institutions became more sound, and the financial market was as stable as ever. Since the Anti-Japanese War, except for Tonghe Bank and Hengxun Tongqing and other banks that have closed down, all peers have been able to tide over the difficulties and preserve some vitality for the country. If it were not for the deep cultivation and strong unity of the silver and money industry, how could this be achieved?

### Restriction on Withdrawal and Deposit is Absolutely Not Needed

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound Society asked a certain financier about his opinion on restricting withdrawals and deposits. Cheng told that on June 21 last year, the Ministry of Finance made a statement on restricting the withdrawal of deposits again because "Shanghai competed to purchase foreign exchange and funds fled, which should be prevented urgently, and the safety financial measures implemented on August 13, of which the restriction on withdrawals and deposits" is to prevent funds from escaping, and to protect the silver and money industry." When Ma Dian was announced, the citizens suddenly heard about this move. Amidst the rumors, there was a moment of panic. Among the depositors in the silver and money industry, those who were originally convinced that there was no need to withdraw their money, had misunderstandings due to rumors, and withdrew their money as much as possible within the limit due to misunderstandings and hid it in cellars. Therefore, the market, which had been flooded with idle funds for a long time, suddenly became tight due to the withdrawal of deposits. Fortunately, the strength of the silver and money industry was sufficient, so it was able to cope with it, so it was believed that restricting withdrawals and deposits was not necessary, but would cause people to withdraw their money.

### The Withdrawal Trend Completely Subsides

Regarding the surge in foreign exchange last week, speculators rushed to the market, and at the same time, they hoarded daily necessities, which caused a trend of withdrawals and deposits in various banks and money houses, but it was not very serious. After each bank and firm prepared sufficient cash to cope with it, the withdrawal trend immediately subsided. Today, all people in the industry have a deep understanding of the meaning of capital blockade and the stability of the new peer-to-peer exchange guarantee during the extraordinary period. Speculators have gradually lost their basis. Finally, I told reporters that after the Ministry of Finance announced the ban on the storage and mortgage regulations of Huangyu at the end of last year, the silver and money industry immediately complied, and although speculators knew that collection violated the ban and the door to mortgage was also closed, they still bought, sold and speculated by taking advantage of the special environment in Shanghai. Therefore, it is hoped that speculators should also be aware and not violate the government's wartime financial policy to avoid soaring prices and affect people's livelihood.

### Smuggling of Private Goods into the Mainland Military Trial

The National Government Strives to Eradicate It to Maintain the Economic Resistance Against Japan

In view of the fact that private goods are still being smuggled into the mainland and have not been eradicated, which has a major impact on the economic future of the resistance against Japan, the Chinese authorities believe that the smuggled private goods are decorated with Chinese trademarks or labeled with the words "Made in China" to deceive the eyes and ears of customs officials and inspecting military police. Cosmetics, textiles, matches, cloth, pencils, etc. are the most common. The authorities have insight into the conspiracy and are now developing strict measures to prevent private goods by the financial and economic departments together with the Military Commission in order to eradicate them. On the one hand, they have also ordered the local commercial organizations to be particularly cautious in the wartime cargo transportation certificates, and they must not be abused. Those who smuggle private goods will be subject to military trials and severely punished.

### British Ambassador

Coming to Shanghai is Not Accurate

Since British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr went to Chongqing in December last year, it has been more than four months. Recently, someone has reported that the British Ambassador will leave Chongqing and come to Shanghai soon. According to the Pingming News Agency reporter, this news is completely inaccurate. Ambassador Clark Kerr will also stay in Chongqing for a long time to maintain close contact with the National Government. He will not come to Shanghai in the near future.

### Various Organizations Mourn Qin Yanqi, Publicly Offer Private Posthumous Titles, Miyi said Mr. Gonghui

Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Charity Association, the Refugee Relief Committee, the Shanghai Local Funds Office, the Disabled Hospital, the Orphanage, the Shanghai Yimiao Board of Directors, the Shangnan Transportation Company, the Sanlin School Board, the Dajiang Middle School, the China Vocational Education Society, the Renji Shantang, the Tongren Fuyuantang, the Jisheng Primary School, the Xinwei Relief Association, the Pudong Township Association, the Si Sheng Primary and Secondary School, the Pushan Villa, the Fushan Hospital, the Xin Puyu Hall, the China Relief Women and Children Association, the Shanghai South District Fire Fighting Association, and other more than 30 organizations held a meeting in the Pudong Township Association to mourn Mr. Qin Yanqi. More than a thousand representatives, relatives, friends and students from various organizations came, and the plain cars and white horses were quite prosperous for a while.

### Gonghui's Life

In the Gengzi year of Guangxu, he supplemented the doctoral disciple, and in the Guiyi year, he ascended to the list of sages. He paid money to become a Zhongshu of the Inner Court and changed his official position to Tongzhi of Hubei. He filled the post of co-examiner of the Gui Mao Township Examination. In the Jia Chen year, he returned home to observe filial piety and did not come out again. He devoted himself to local schools and public welfare undertakings, setting up the Keqin Academy and the Saling School Puyi Vocational Training Institute. He also served in the Tongren Fuyuantang. He wrote a lot of books. Even at the age of eighty, he was still diligent in learning and kind to people. When his hometown fell, he took refuge in Shanghai.

### Publicly Offered Private Posthumous Titles

After Wu Shutian elaborated on his virtuous deeds, Lin Kanghou and Jia Jiying gave eulogies one after another, saying that he was upright in life and understood righteousness, was not tempted by profit, and was not threatened by force. In recent years, he has cultivated a lot of local vitality, which is enough to be a model for the younger generation. He should publicly offer private posthumous titles to show respect. After passing the whole body, he was awarded the posthumous title of Mr. Gonghui. Lin Kanghou handed over the position of Mr. Gonghui to his family, and offered incense and flowers to perform the ceremony, and then dispersed the meeting.

### There is a rumor that the barbed wire on Nanjing Road will be removed

Police officers of the Bureau of Works went to conduct on-site inspections yesterday

Since the various lanes and streets of Nanjing Road were blocked by the police authorities, the business operations of the shops fell into a desperate situation. They presented a request to remove the barbed wire in order to facilitate traffic and maintain livelihood. It is reported that the Bureau of Works sent Chinese and Western police officers to the shops in the Longquan Garden area of Nanjing Road to conduct on-site investigations yesterday in order to understand the difficulties of the merchants. The residents of Jinling Bank and other residents detailed the difficulties after being blocked. It is now heard that the bureau will send personnel to remove the barbed wire as requested, but the date has not been determined.

### A large number of counterfeit banknotes were transported to Shanghai to undermine the legal currency

The public should pay attention

It has recently been heard that a certain party, in order to undermine the status of the Chinese method of legal currency, has printed a large number of counterfeit banknotes in a printing house in China (including four types: China, Central, Transportation and Farmers Bank), and is using them indiscriminately in various occupied areas. Many places have been found in this city. The general ignorant citizens have suffered greatly. I sincerely hope that the public will pay attention to avoid being fooled.

### British Union Strike Labor and Management Negotiations Progress

The Zilin West Report stated that about 900 workers at the British Union Shipyard on Yangshupu Road have been on strike since March 14. Labor and management have been consulting each other, but have not yet reached an agreement. However, it was reliably stated yesterday (4th) that there has been great progress in the talks between the two sides, and the strike will come to an end based on the phenomenon.

### National Flags Flying All Over the City Celebrating the Double Fifth Anniversary

Yesterday, the "Fifth and Fifth" was the anniversary of the appointment of the Prime Minister of our Kuomintang as the Extraordinary President. In order to commemorate the great spirit of the Prime Minister, people from all walks of life in the city hung national flags and celebrated the holiday in accordance with the concession agreement. A large number of patriotic leaflets were found in various places in the city, including (1) Commemorating the "Fifth and Fifth", we must emulate the Prime Minister's great personality, (2) Commemorating the "Fifth and Fifth", we must inherit the Prime Minister's legacy, (3) Commemorating the "Fifth and Fifth", we must not yield, not fear death, and not compromise (4) Commemorating the "Fifth and Fifth", we must firmly believe that the Anti-Japanese War will be won and the country will be built (5) Celebrating the Double Fifth Festival should be based on our own position and engage in national salvation work (6) Celebrating the Double Fifth Festival should strive for the independence and freedom of the people and the country (7) We must inspect and eliminate traitors from our own ranks. In order to prevent the activities of reactionary elements, the Public Concession Police Department sent two red security forces at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to block and search Fujian Road, Edward Road, Beihai Road, Guangdong Road, and other areas.

### Grain Hoarders Deliberately Raise Prices Elimination Cannot Be Delayed Any Longer Creating Air to Enter Rather Than Exit Honest Sales Are Regarded As Waste Rice Number Industry Letter to the Authorities To Implement Suggestions

On May 6, the Shanghai Rice Number Industry Association sent a letter to the authorities of the British and French Concessions, stating that, respectfully, in the past, because of the rising price of rice, the association suggested on April 4 this year to take five measures to eliminate hoarding of rice, and petitioned the Bureau to adopt and implement them. When Mongolia was examined, it was recorded that the Bureau replied on April 9. However, in recent days, due to the relationship between currency shrinkage and gold appreciation, the price of rice has also soared. The selling price per stone has reached 534 yuan, and the black market price of national rice has also risen. These phenomena are actually excuses made by general speculative manipulators to deliberately raise prices and become more and more serious. The people's livelihood has been greatly affected.

### Market Transactions

All transactions are bought and sold in whole numbers by manipulators, so that members and stores of the association are required to purchase 20 to 30 bags of retail rice stones for supply. It is very difficult to buy them, but the owners use whole numbers as opponents and regard our honest and real sellers as waste, so it is difficult for the industry to distribute all kinds every day, and the cost is increasing day by day, and the situation of the people in the retail business is even more unbearable to witness. In this situation, tracing back to the source, it is caused by hoarders and monopolists with strong capital strength. According to the current rice reserves in various stacks in the city, there are about one million, and the bottom is not thick, and most of this large amount of rice

### Has Already Been Stored

They were all purchased at low prices. The rice reserves seem to be so abundant. If hoarders are willing to consider the difficulties of the times, abandon their selfish desires, do not pursue the crazy tide, and take the overall situation into consideration, no matter how much the exchange rate shrinks or how high the price of gold rises, the price of rice should not be affected by it and reach this peak. Today, speculators who hoard and manipulate, on the one hand, create an atmosphere, saying that the European war has expanded and navigation is difficult, and the cost of exchange shrinkage and gold appreciation is high, and arbitrarily raise prices to pay for their selfish desires. On the one hand, they make rare goods available for sale and enter rather than exit, hoarding a large amount for sale to wait for a good price, causing the people's livelihood to become precarious. This is just for the selfish desires of a few people, placing

### Public Food

If the hoarders are not strictly eliminated and allowed to monopolize for a long time, the price of rice will inevitably rise day by day, and no one knows when it will end. The people's food security is in danger. The Bureau of Labor and Food has always attached great importance to people's livelihood in dealing with people's food, and it should take swift and decisive action on the above-mentioned situations. The situation is urgent and should not be delayed any longer. Therefore, it is specially written in the letter, hoping that the Bureau of Labor and Food will quickly implement the five measures recommended by the association on April 4 in order to maintain people's food and ensure security.

### Actual Situation

A reporter from Shewen News Agency specially visited a certain rice industry. According to the reporter, the current rise is nothing more than the result of blind purchases and storage by food households, and the owners taking the opportunity to sell at high prices, which led to the price increase and competition of the guest houses. In fact, the number of deposits in the city is more than one million, and the source is still endless. Not only is there no shortage of food for the people in the future, but also the high price is difficult to maintain for a long time. As for flour, a bumper harvest of new wheat this year is expected to be on the market soon, and the selling price is expected to be reduced at that time. However, the export of Huachang flour has been obstructed for a long time.

### Details of the Special Police in West Shanghai It is said that there are clues

Regarding the issue of police power over the road construction outside the boundary of West Shanghai, since the "Agreement" was established on February 11, Chief Patrol of the Bureau of Works Bao En has held weekly meetings with the false "Police Chief Lu Ying and his Japanese consultant Isoshi Midori" in accordance with the established principles to draft the details for the establishment of the "Special Police" and gradually discuss them. As of last night, according to news from the Japanese side, specific measures have been quite promising, and may be officially announced within the month if no other loopholes occur.

### The Japanese side asked Tokyo for instructions on the resumption of navigation of the French Yong'an Wheel

The French Post Company's Yuangan ship, which had been moored at the French Concession pier in Hankou for more than a year, was allowed by the French authorities to be used as a shelter for Chinese people when the situation in Wuhan was critical. Last December, with the consent of the Japanese side, the ship sailed back to Shanghai from Hankou, preparing to rent it to local shipping companies to travel to various ports in China. It is reported that the repairs have been completed, and the ship had been chartered by shipping companies and scheduled to sail on the Shanghai-Zhejiang route this month. However, after learning about it, the Japanese side used the excuse that the ship had carried French naval soldiers when it came to Shanghai from Hankou, and prevented the ship from sailing to various ports in eastern Zhejiang. Currently, the French Post Company and the shipowner have filed a protest with the Japanese Navy on this matter. The Japanese Navy authorities especially asked Tokyo for instructions before making a decision. So far, they have not sought a reply.

### Jingjiang Huajun Regiment Attached Was Killed by Soldiers

According to a gentleman who arrived in Shanghai from Jingjiang yesterday, a regiment headquarters of the Huajun He Keqian Brigade was stationed in Jingjiang. Liu Ailin, the regimental attached officer and reconnaissance captain, was only a weak crown and was extremely brave, so He Yi was extremely fond of him, and he also got along well with the local people. On the 29th of last month, Liu Fengling led four guards, Zheng Ganglin and Cai Jinning, to Shixu Daidi to work. Unexpectedly, Zheng and Cai suddenly rebelled. At 3:00 a.m. that day, they falsely claimed that they had found a dark shadow outside the house. When Liu went out, he was shot in the back by Ruobeil, and three shots were fired, all hitting the vital parts. Although Liu was wounded, he still turned around and fought back, firing a bullet and hitting Zheng. He fell into the river. Liu also died of excessive blood loss due to serious injuries. The case caused great shock in all walks of life. The funeral has been arranged, and an order has been issued to strictly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice.

### Shopkeepers Hoarding for Profit; the Public Should Report Them; Japanese Troops Abolish Restrictions on Local Produce Transportation to Shanghai, Allowing for Forced Reduction in Prices

According to the Continental Daily News, concerning the sudden surge in prices for several commodities in this city yesterday (the 4th), a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Equalization Committee told reporters that the Council's warnings could not curb the price hikes following the devaluation of legal tender. This is because there are relatively few merchants who are actually hoarding for profit. Therefore, it is expected that the prices of both imported and domestic goods will rise to new levels that correspond to the current exchange rate before they stop increasing. The notices issued by the two Settlement authorities are merely intended to warn merchants against taking advantage of exchange rate fluctuations to seek illicit gains. He does not believe that merchants in this city are making large profits through illegal hoarding. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Equalization Committee, no merchants have been found to be profiting illegally and punished accordingly. Shanghai's prices are affected by exchange rates, and the prices of imported goods may increase by more than half. The prices of domestic products such as food will also increase slightly, as the cost of foreign coal and gasoline used to transport food to Shanghai has increased, leading to higher freight charges. Moreover, the operating expenses and warehouse rent of transportation companies have all increased. The only way to reduce the prices of domestic products is to increase the amount of goods transported to Shanghai. If there is a surplus of goods, the law of supply and demand will force prices down. Currently, it is necessary for the Japanese troops to abolish their restrictions on the transportation of food to Shanghai in order to achieve the desired effect of forcing prices down. However, although the Japanese side has promised to abolish the restrictions, there is little hope of this promise being fulfilled at present. If the Japanese side continues to impose excessive taxes and levies on domestic products transported to Shanghai, the prices of domestic products will inevitably increase slightly. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the Bureau of Industry are unable to regulate prices. Although they are closely monitoring prices in the market, they cannot investigate every small shop engaging in hoarding for profit. Only the public can detect these activities. Therefore, the public is requested to report any instances of small shops hoarding for profit to the Bureau of Industry.

### Qungong Silk Factory Labor Dispute Resolved Yesterday

The Qungong Silk Factory in western Shanghai experienced a labor dispute on April 16th due to the management shortening working hours under the pretext of poor business conditions. Workers, facing reduced income insufficient to maintain their livelihood, initiated a strike. After several days of striking, it was reported yesterday, May 3rd, that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Department dispatched personnel to mediate, resulting in a satisfactory resolution. Starting yesterday, all workers have officially returned to work at the factory.

### Speculation with Legitimate Funds; Secretly Suffering the Consequences; Hoarders Raising Prices Causing Unprecedented Need in the Market; Gold and Foreign Stocks with Only Outflow and No Inflow; a Tragic Decline is Inevitable

Since the drastic fluctuations in the black market for foreign exchange, unstable elements have taken the opportunity to spread rumors, causing major markets to fluctuate wildly. Those with little understanding believe these rumors to be true, and a run on banks even occurred the day before yesterday. Citizens, unaware of the truth, often inquire about the future prospects of the Shanghai market. A member of the financial community expressed his opinion, stating that according to reliable statistics, the total amount of idle capital in the city since the war is as high as five hundred billion yuan. "Idle capital" refers to funds circulating in the market without a legitimate purpose. Initially, it was concentrated on purchasing foreign exchange, then on hoarding goods, and finally on purchasing foreign stocks. After the foreign stock market calmed down, it concentrated on foreign exchange again. The disruptive power of the city's idle capital concentrated in one place is self-evident. Those who do not understand the truth participate without authorization, thinking they are protecting themselves, but in reality, they are disrupting their own plans. Under the current Shanghai environment, this trend cannot be stopped in an instant.

Not Genuine Consumption

The balance of foreign exchange depends on supply and demand. The Shanghai foreign exchange market is disrupted by idle capital and the hoarding of goods, leading to an increase in import surpluses, making it difficult for the foreign exchange market to balance. The revised figures for Shanghai's trade in March of this year show an increase of 700 million yuan in the import surplus. However, this increase is not a cause for concern. Hoarders use idle capital to purchase goods, then use the goods as collateral for loans from banks, and then engage in more hoarding, allowing their purchasing power to expand infinitely and import surpluses to expand infinitely. These imported goods are not genuinely consumed but are merely piled up in warehouses. Therefore, Shanghai's import surplus is not a genuine import surplus but the result of artificial forces. Furthermore, the current prices in Shanghai are raised by hoarders and have exceeded cost. For example, newsprint was priced at only 28 yuan a week ago, but the market price is 34 yuan. Under the current state of public panic, market prices can be raised indefinitely. However, once the turmoil subsides slightly, can it be sustained? Last year, newsprint rose to 30 yuan but eventually fell to 18 yuan. The situation this year is likely a repeat of the European war turmoil of last year. In the future, as hoarded goods are released, imports will naturally decrease, while exports will not decrease. At that time, will the supply of foreign exchange not exceed demand, leading to a loose and excessive market?

Gold and Foreign Stocks are Worrying

Based on this, it is not surprising that the price of gold has risen to 7,000 yuan and foreign stocks have risen tenfold or twentyfold. Speculators largely use loan methods to buy and sell gold and foreign stocks, lacking genuine purchasing power. Currently, there are insufficient chips, so prices are naturally rising. If the turmoil subsides, there will only be outflows and no inflows in the market, and a sharp drop in market prices is inevitable, creating an unprecedented storm. At this time, those who hold the most gold and foreign stocks will suffer the greatest losses. In general, those who participate in speculation often think they are clever, but the result is that they buy at the highest price and sell at the lowest price. The results of hoarding last year serve as a warning.

Soaring Prices Have No Justification

At this point, the gentleman further discussed the inappropriateness of the soaring prices of foreign stocks. The price of stocks depends on the company itself, but the standard of market price is the dividend. Last year, the best-performing stocks, such as those of a certain yarn factory, yielded only 15 yuan per share based on the face value. Now, the stocks of some yarn factories have risen more than tenfold above their face value, even if the original dividend rate is maintained, it would only amount to one week's interest. Moreover, the right to issue dividends rests with the company, and no one can decide it. Although rubber stocks may increase in price due to the rising price of rubber, there is a limit. Anyone who understands matters can easily understand this by examining the contents of each company.

Invest in Legitimate Avenues

The panic of the general public is nothing more than a desire for asset appreciation. Asset appreciation depends on one's own efforts and not on speculation. Even if one is lucky enough to gain one day, one will surely lose one day. Therefore, if those who possess capital channel their funds into the speculative market, they are not only cutting themselves off from the country and the nation, but also aiding the wicked and harming the public and themselves in terms of personal interest. If everyone can stand firm and deposit their funds in banks and financial institutions, and if banks and financial institutions then engage in large-scale and profitable production activities, speculators will have nothing to rely on.

Citizens Should Calm Themselves

The gentleman concluded that the future of the Shanghai market is currently under special circumstances, and the government not only cannot suppress it, but also does not need to suppress it under the current situation. If citizens do not disrupt their own plans, they will not suffer losses. According to his observations, the smoke screen of speculators in the Shanghai market has disappeared in the past day or two, and the financial situation is gradually stabilizing and will soon return to peace. He hopes that citizens will calm themselves during this period.

### Manufacturers Handling Certificate Issuance for Goods Sold Outside Shanghai

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to various trade associations regarding the issuance of national goods proof lists, stating that in principle, the application for proof lists issued by the Chamber must be reviewed and forwarded by the trade association to which the seller of the goods belongs before they can be issued. However, for the past two months, manufacturers and firms selling goods have largely ignored the process of applying for proof lists once the goods are sold, leaving it entirely to the resellers. Resellers, being intermediaries, often lack information regarding the source of raw materials in the sixth item when filling out the application form. The original manufacturers and firms selling the goods remain detached, unwilling to disclose the situation. Repeated inquiries often yield no results, and the weekly and monthly report forms are largely evaded. The Chamber has long intended to rectify this situation, but due to the emergence of numerous department store wholesalers in the wake of the military conflicts, most of them do not specialize in any particular industry and engage in diverse activities. The original manufacturers and firms that produce and sell goods are unwilling to apply for proof lists for the resellers. Therefore, they had to temporarily accommodate the situation, which was a temporary expedient. The circumstances of this roundabout accommodation are as described above. In the future, each trade association should inform its members that whenever goods are sold to other ports, they should be responsible for handling the certificate issuance procedures and not delegate them to the resellers. If they do not abandon their responsibility, non-industry firms will not be able to overstep their boundaries. This notice is hereby issued in the hope that it will be followed accordingly.

### Barbershops Conserving Water and Electricity; Setting Business Hours

The Shanghai Barber Association, due to the soaring prices of gas, water, and electricity, has formulated industry regulations and issued a notice to fellow businesses to comply with them, stating that in view of the rising prices, each affiliated shop has united in solidarity. Eighty-five businesses within the two Settlements have gathered to establish affiliated shop rules, which each affiliated shop will sign and seal to jointly abide by in order to strengthen unity. The rules are listed below: (1) Business hours: First-class affiliated shops, 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM; Second-class affiliated shops, 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM; Third-class affiliated shops, 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM. After the Double Ninth Festival, First-class affiliated shops will remain the same; Second-class affiliated shops will close at 8:00 PM; Third-class affiliated shops will close at 9:00 PM. (2) Penalties: If any affiliated shop violates the business hour regulations or privately increases or decreases prices, a warning will be issued for the first offense, and a fine will be imposed for the second offense: 30 yuan for First-class affiliated shops, 20 yuan for Second-class affiliated shops, and 10 yuan for Third-class affiliated shops. (3) The designated responsible affiliated shops are listed below: New Rose, Paris, Mei Mei, Brothers, Linxi Society, Xuan Palace, Bao Ji, Beautiful, Yingzhou, Tongfu, Anle Palace, Star, Xue Lianji, New Hanmin, Haizhou, Xileye, New Leye, Metropolitan, Daxin.

All merchants are requested to take note of this. This notice is hereby issued. Signed, Harbour Master T. Bek.

### Driven by Greed, Coal Briquettes Rise in Price Again Yesterday, Rising Three Times in Ten Days, Yesterday Rising to 9.40 Yuan per Load; Authorities of the Two Settlements Should Urgently Prohibit This

The price of coal briquettes has soared recently. Yesterday's market price rose again to 9.40 yuan, causing public outrage. The extent of the panic has become the biggest problem currently. According to the notice issued by the authorities of the two Settlements on the 3rd of this month, strict sanctions and urgent prohibitions should be applied to maintain the authority of the law and avoid disturbing the people of the city.

Three Consecutive Increases

The price of coal briquettes had already increased on April 26, with the price per ton being 137 yuan in national currency and 7.40 yuan per load. On May 3, it rose again to 160 yuan and 8.50 yuan per load. By yesterday, when coal briquette retailers purchased coal briquettes from the major coal companies, it had risen again to 178 yuan per ton, and the retail price was set at 9.40 yuan per load. In ten days, it had risen three times, with a total increase of 41 yuan per ton. In previous years, the price of rice in the city was only 12-13 yuan per shi, but each shi of rice weighs about 160 jin, while each load of coal briquettes weighs 100 jin, so the actual price has exceeded the rice prices of previous years, which is alarming.

Driven by Greed

According to those familiar with the coal industry, the soaring market price of coal briquettes, although there are other contributing factors, is mainly due to the manipulation of the major coal briquette factories. After the so-called plan to urge the release of warehouse receipts was implemented, they made huge profits. It is said that one coal briquette factory alone made a profit of 17 million yuan last year. The greater their profits, the more the common people suffer. In the past three days, they have taken advantage of the black market exchange rate tightening to raise prices twice, increasing the price by 1.90 yuan per load. In reality, the black market exchange rate tightening does not mean that legal tender is devaluing, and these raw materials and products have already been stockpiled in large quantities, so there is no reason for such a large price increase. Their pursuit of profit and the suffering of the common people are obvious. The livelihoods of the common people are greatly threatened. The authorities of the two Concessions recently announced that they would crack down on opportunistic price increases, and they should take active action.

Solely Organize Fair Sales

After the expiration of the fourth period of fair-price coal briquette sales, the Yitai Xing Coal Briquette Factory intends to continue to take on the responsibility of relief, organizing the sale of 22,000 loads of low-priced coal briquettes from the 11th to the 30th of this month, establishing 20 fair-price coal briquette purchase points for civilians and 5 coal briquette purchase points for laborers. The methods are as follows: (1) The civilian coal briquette purchase points will sell 40 loads of low-priced coal briquettes daily, with each person limited to purchasing four jiao, totaling five market jin, starting at 2:00 PM daily until sold out. (2) The laborer coal briquette purchase points will sell 60 loads of low-priced coal briquettes daily, with each person limited to purchasing fifteen market jin, totaling 1.20 yuan in national currency, starting at 9:30 AM until sold out. The detailed locations will be announced on May 10th. In order to facilitate coal briquette purchases, the factory has also issued user notification forms for regular purchases, which can be obtained and filled out to register with the factory. The methods are as follows: (1) Primary school teachers and staff regular delivery registration users, the price for May is 7.50 yuan per load, with a quota of 200 loads per day, while supplies last. (2) Cultural institutions, charitable organizations, police constables of the two Settlements, staff of various impoverished institutions, and food vendors in various small vegetable markets regular delivery registration users, the price for May is 8 yuan per load, with a quota of 1,000 loads, while supplies last. (3) Ordinary regular delivery users, the price for May is 8.50 yuan per load, with a quota of 500 loads, while supplies last. (4) Small factories using the baking industry regular delivery registration users, the price is the same as the wholesale price of the day plus the cost of transportation, with a quota of 100 tons per day, while supplies last. (5) Personal businesses and various consulate regular delivery users, coal briquettes can be delivered on schedule.

### Landlord's Lawsuit for Tenant to Install Water Meters Dismissed

The houses in the Baoqingfang area of Qipulu and Tiantonglu belong to Feng Zuozhou. There are about fifty or sixty households living in the area. In November of last year, the landlord, citing the increase in the price of tap water, required each tenant to install their own water meter, otherwise the water supply would be cut off. The tenants jointly hired lawyer Chen Wencan to provide a guarantee of 2,000 yuan in national currency and petitioned the First Special Court for an injunction. Judge Gui Yu ruled on November 25 that after the petitioners jointly provided a guarantee of 2,000 yuan in national currency, the debtor Feng Zuozhou and others should not stop the water supply to the houses at various numbers on Tiantonglu, Qipulu, and Baoqingfang rented by the petitioners until the lawsuit was resolved. Recently, Feng Zuozhou entrusted his agent, the British merchant Dehe Foreign Company's legal representative Ma Lisi, to hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court's Civil Division against Ye Changde, Wang Fengkui, Tong Hailin, and other residents of Baoqingfang No. 33, No. 39, and No. 49, requesting permission to install water meters on their behalf and to bear the water costs themselves. The defendants hired lawyer Chen Wencan to defend them in court. Judge Dong Qiming announced the judgment the day before yesterday, dismissing the plaintiff's lawsuit and ordering the plaintiff to bear the litigation costs.

### Salvation Army Refugee Shelter, Repatriation Plan

The Qi Qi Road Muyang Shelter Above-Mentioned Ended

According to the Continental Daily News, Salvation Army Major Ma Ruishan stated that the Chinese refugees in the Dunxin Road Shelter, the largest in scale, could be repatriated almost entirely by the end of this month. The Salvation Army takes care of two shelters, Dunxin Road and Qile Road (as in Qiqi lu) in the French Concession, with a total of about 20,000 refugees.

Qile Road

The repatriation of 4,100 refugees in the shelter began on April 19 and was completed in nine days, with 500 people being repatriated daily. Therefore, the shelter was closed last Saturday.

Dunxin Road

The evacuation of the shelter began at the same time, and to date, 6,463 refugees have left the shelter. In total, 7,563 refugees have been repatriated, costing 46,101 yuan. When refugees leave the camp, each person is given a fee of 15 yuan and travel expenses of 3 yuan. Refugees under the age of 16 are given a fee of 10 yuan and travel expenses of 3 yuan. Most of the refugees leaving the camp are people from the occupied areas near Shanghai, and there is no great difficulty in returning to their hometowns.

Still Being Cared For

There are currently 12,385 refugees remaining in the Dunxin Road Shelter. The Salvation Army hopes to repatriate 9,000 of them this month, and the remaining few are expected to be repatriated in the first week of June. Currently, the Dunxin Road Shelter has 1,929 elderly, weak, and orphans, as well as 5,600 elderly and weak refugees from other shelters in the city, who must be permanently cared for. It is estimated that about 10,000 refugees in the city have been repatriated since March. Four of the 27 shelters have been closed. Currently, there are still about 25,000 refugees remaining in the city.

### Liu Haisu's Fundraising Art Exhibition in the Dutch East Indies, Raising 280,000 Yuan

Liu Haisu, the president of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts and a famous painter, was invited by overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies at the end of November last year to hold a fundraising art exhibition. The overseas Chinese welcomed him warmly. In January of this year, it was decided to hold the first exhibition in Batavia, displaying more than 400 works donated by Liu, teachers and students of the Academy, and contemporary masters. In addition to the enthusiastic attendance of overseas Chinese from all walks of life to view and purchase books, foreign guests included the Dutch East Indies Minister of Economy Fan Mu and his wife, the Minister of Interior and his wife, the city magistrate of Batavia, the director of the East Asia Department, consuls from the United States, France, and Switzerland, and foreign reporters and painters, who lingered and admired the works, reluctant to leave. Many paintings were purchased on the spot. In Batavia alone, more than 150,000 yuan in national currency was raised and donated to the Shandi Charity Association to aid disaster victims in Guiyang. The Dutch East Indies Art Museum, impressed by the excellence of Liu's works and influenced by public opinion, made an exception and requested Liu to hand over a portion of his personal works to the museum to be exhibited on tour in Bandung, Surabaya, Semarang, Bogor, and other places, and finally return to Batavia for exhibition, which would take six to eight months to complete. According to Mrs. Le Fo, director of the museum, this is the first time that the Dutch East Indies Art Museum has exhibited famous Chinese paintings since its establishment, and it is very fortunate to have Liu's generous consent. Recently, at the request of overseas Chinese in Surabaya, Liu took his personal works and works donated by various parties to Surabaya to continue the fundraising art exhibition. With the enthusiastic welcome of all sectors, the result was another 130,000 yuan in national currency. In total, 280,000 yuan was raised in Batavia and Surabaya. This trip not only raised a large sum of money to aid disaster victims, but also promoted the culture of the motherland and strengthened international relations, which is of great significance. When the art exhibition was held in Surabaya, Fan Zhina, the governor of East Java Province, visited three times and praised Liu's works, calling them the creation of immortal humanity and that only the greatest international artists of this era, such as Liu, could create them. He also purchased three of Liu's works: the large "Snow Clearing on Cold Mountain" (50 yuan), "Poet's Journey" (2,000 yuan), and the small "Reed Geese" (1,500 yuan). Fan is learned and knowledgeable and has a deep understanding of art and Eastern culture. A grand tea party was held on the 3rd of this month to entertain Liu, and the large "Snow Clearing on Cold Mountain" was hung in the center of the main hall of the Governor's Mansion, showing great respect. The Dutch East Indies Art Museum's tour exhibition of Liu's works has also begun in Bandung with great fanfare.

"Snow Clearing on Cold Mountain"

### Child Trafficking Criminals Awaiting Judgment After Trial

Elderly Man in His Fifties Grieves the Loss of His Only Son, Severed Families Should be Severely Punished

Yang Xinzheng, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, detectives Zhang Decai and Western detective Divi, and others, cracked a large-scale human trafficking organization at Fuxinxiang Tobacco, Wine, and Sundries Store at 355 Baoding Road, confiscating more than a hundred children's clothes and many shoes and hats, and arresting the criminals Ling Rongsen, Ling Zhang, Dai Lu, Wang Li Fu, Wang Wu, Cui Teng, Wang Zhang, Lu Wenzhong, Zhuge Chun, Zhuge Qian, and others, and recovering two children, Zhang Dingkang and Chuan Bingkui. It was found that these people had committed more than a hundred kidnapping cases in the concession, and clothing, etc., had been identified in fifty-two cases, and they were sent to the First Special Court for trial and detention. It is now learned that the trial is being postponed. Gu Zhidong and others' families recognized the lost children's clothes. When Judge Xiao continued the trial yesterday morning, Gu Zhidong complained about the kidnapping of his child, saying that he was already in his fifties and only had this eight-year-old child, and now he was heartbroken to have him kidnapped. The families of other lost children were touched by the scene and cried out in unison, moving the listeners to tears. Then, Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, said that this large-scale kidnapping case was the largest ever solved by the police, and the separation of families was even more serious than kidnapping. Life and death separation is the greatest pain in life. The kidnapped children are all good-looking and are sold to other places as the sons of villagers. Under these special circumstances, it makes it impossible for father and son to ever meet. The case is serious and should be severely punished. The court ordered the defendants to be detained pending sentencing.

### Manager of Yicun Rentals in Arrears on Land Rent, Landlord Sues for Payment

Wu Zhongcheng, a local resident, owns a piece of land in the French Concession, at the intersection of Gu Shenfu Road and Zhao Zhu Jiao Road, measuring one mu, three fen, and six li. In January of last year, Zhang Yixun (residing at 93 Jie Road), the owner of Huaan Real Estate Company at 128-533 Bowuyuan Road, a Ningbo native, discussed with Wu building six Yicun garden houses on the land for long-term rental. If someone leases the houses, the lease period would be 20 years at a time, and the tenant would pay a considerable amount of money to live in the house for 20 years without paying any rent. Wu agreed to this plan and signed a contract, stipulating that Wu would receive 14,400 yuan in land rent for 20 years. Wu would be the nominal landlord, and Zhang would be the rental contractor. In addition to the land rent that Wu should receive, if there were any profits, Zhang would receive 75% and Wu would receive 25%. If there were any losses due to poor design or increased costs, Zhang would bear them all. At the end of the 20-year period, the ownership of the houses would revert to Wu Zhongcheng. By the end of last year, the houses were completed, and the rent paid by the tenants totaled 55,000 yuan, which Zhang collected in full. However, Zhang only paid Wu 8,270 yuan of the 14,400 yuan in land rent that Wu should have received, and the remaining 6,130 yuan was not paid. After repeated demands, it was not paid. Zhang finally admitted that he had used the money to purchase securities and signed an IOU promising to repay it by February 10. However, he only returned 500 yuan. Wu believed that Zhang's behavior clearly violated Article 336 of the Criminal Law for embezzlement and hired lawyer Tao Muxia to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, requesting a criminal prosecution against Zhang and an attached civil lawsuit requesting a judgment ordering the repayment of the unpaid 1,630 yuan and overdue interest at a rate of five percent per annum. Zhang also hired lawyer Sun Zuji to defend him, arguing that the case was civil in nature, so he requested a judgment of innocence. After Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the court for questioning yesterday, he ordered the trial to be adjourned for further hearing.

### Old Zhabei Police Station: Strict Crackdown on Drug Dealers

Recently, in various alleys within the jurisdiction of the Old Zhabei Police Station, there have been Koreans colluding with Chinese to sell heroin. Almost every alley has traces of these individuals. The police authorities, recognizing the severe harm to the people if strict measures are not taken, have dispatched a large number of Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives to conduct round-the-clock arrests. In recent days, many Koreans selling drugs have been apprehended and handed over to the Japanese consulate for severe punishment. Consequently, the presence of these individuals has significantly decreased compared to before. However, the police station is not relaxing its efforts and continues to rigorously enforce measures to eliminate the poisonous atmosphere.

### Iron Gate Entrance of Zilaihuo Street: Armed Man Intercepted

It is reported that yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, a man in his thirties, wearing a Western-style suit, entered the French Concession through the iron gate at the Zilaihuo Street entrance on MinGuo Road from the Nanshi area. The patrol officers stationed there found his demeanor suspicious and searched him, discovering a loaded handgun. He was immediately taken to the police station for further investigation. It is rumored that the man is a citizen of a certain country, but confirmation is still pending.

### Suicide Reports

At the Chongqing Hotel on Chongqing Road, Dagu Road, in the Public Concession, a guest arrived the night before, registering under the name Yao Jinsheng, a local resident, 36 years old. He was assigned room number 9. Unexpectedly, at 10:15 AM yesterday, Yao suddenly ingested poison. The tea server discovered this and urgently called an ambulance to transport him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is said that the reason for Yao's suicide was significant gambling debts incurred at a casino in western Shanghai. Before taking the poison, he even cut a large square of flesh from his arm to express his remorse.

At 11:20 AM yesterday, a guest named Li Genbao, 28 years old, staying in room 26 of the Jiangsu Hotel at No. 50, Lane 396, Fuzhou Road, due to recent exorbitant prices and economic pressure, unable to make ends meet, ingested Lysol inside his room. He was subsequently sent to the hospital for treatment.

Cai Wenkui, a Chaozhou native, 24 years old, was an apprentice at a pawnshop on Da Xi Road. He only earned a monthly wage of two yuan. In April of last year, he married a fellow villager, Ms. Zhang (19 years old this year). Initially, the couple's relationship was harmonious, but Ms. Zhang gradually became dissatisfied with Cai's financial situation, leading to a cooling of their affection. Because her husband's income was limited, preventing her from spending freely, and coupled with criticism from her in-laws, Ms. Zhang became despondent and ingested poison at home the day before yesterday afternoon. Her aunt discovered her and immediately sent her to Guangci Hospital, but she died despite the efforts to save her.

### Social Miscellany

The Yutai Copperware Shop at No. 415, Caishi Road, in the French Concession, often sends people out to collect scrap copper for recasting into utensils. Recently, they collected a pile of scrap copper. Yesterday morning (the 4th) at 8:30 AM, Qian Amao (38 years old), a coppersmith from Shaoxing, was sorting through it when he discovered a shell. Not recognizing it, Qian treated it as a piece of copper and struck it with a hammer. The shell detonated upon impact, immediately severing both his hands and his right lower leg. Blood splattered everywhere, and he collapsed on the ground. He was subsequently transported to the hospital for treatment.

Yesterday morning around 11:00 AM, two robbers appeared near Kangnaotuo Road on Xinjiapo Road in western Shanghai. One robber, wielding a gun, robbed a passing woman, taking a gold ring and 30 yuan in legal tender before fleeing.

According to the Continental News, a local woman named Yang Lianying, 16 years old, was struck and killed by a public bus driven by Hu Chengxing (transliteration) of the "Huazhong Metropolitan Motor Company" while passing Xi Huaide Road last Friday.

### Fundraising Charity Fair: Enthusiastic Ticket Sales from All Sectors

The Shanghai Jishan Charity Fair, organized by the Shanghai Relief and Education Center for Refugee Children, has seen enthusiastic ticket sales from various philanthropists in recent days. Most notably, Yue Opera Queen Yao Shuijuan specially pledged to sell 1,000 yuan worth of tickets yesterday, and committee member Pei Qiting also pledged to sell 1,000 yuan worth of tickets, demonstrating their enthusiastic support. As the number of tickets is limited, any enthusiastic ladies and gentlemen who wish to purchase tickets can do so at Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, The Sun, Lihua Chinese Goods Company, Hungsheng Company, the Minle Tea Room in the French Park, and Heming Shoe Store.

Whether consumed cold or hot, it is suitable from spring to winter, at any time. Its efficacy is no less than imported products, and its price is less than half of imported products. No wonder ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life are eager to purchase and consume it.

The Sichuan Store on Nanjing Road in this city has long been known for its authentic Sichuan Tremella. Recently, in view of the increasingly tight foreign exchange situation and the soaring prices of imported tonics, to take the opportunity to promote the special tonic and moisturizing effects of Sichuan Tremella and advocate for the consumption of domestic products, during the price surge, the store is holding a grand price reduction. In recent days, the store has been packed with customers, creating an unprecedented scene.

French dentist Shen Hechen has been practicing in the French Concession on Luban Road for many years. His surgical skills are excellent and well-known throughout Shanghai.

### Japanese Miscellany (2)

Kobe is only sixty-some li away from Osaka. Its land is rich and beautiful, surpassing all other places in Japan. The number of bridges is perhaps the highest among all the cities of the world. Among the bridges, the Tenma Bridge is the longest, spanning about sixty-some zhang. The Chiyosaki Bridge is the highest, hanging high above the water. The Naniwa Bridge is the most eye-catching, built in the middle of the river, with small islands surrounding it on both sides, resembling a rainbow in the sky. Ancient pines and cypresses, teahouses and waterside pavilions, are intertwined into a painting on both sides of the small islands. The Japanese worship gods, Buddhas, and fox spirits, believing in them deeply! The Tenma Shrine is the largest center of incense offering in Osaka, followed by the Sumiyoshi Shrine, which is located over ten li south of Osaka, reachable in two hours by rickshaw. The temples within the city are merely temporary palaces. It is said that Sumiyoshi's relationship to Osaka is like Guangxiao's relationship to Guangzhou, both existing before the city itself. A main road leads directly to the temple, with fields of five grains and cotton planted on both sides. Along the way, there are teahouses for travelers to rest, with the Tenka Teahouse being the most elegant. The Japanese emperor once visited this place. The Sumiyoshi Shrine is spacious, with thousands of ancient trees of unknown age. Entering it, one forgets the heat of summer. Teahouses line the lotus pond within the temple. Leaning against the railings, admiring the lotus flowers, is truly delightful. A divine bridge is built on the pond, shaped like a crescent moon. Those who cross this bridge must walk with firm steps. Outside the temple, there are countless teahouses and taverns, with the Nikka Teahouse being the most spacious. To be continued tomorrow: Spring Festival Greetings.

### What is the Future of Foreign Exchange?

— Xia Zhi

Now is the Time to Laugh Out Loud

Although the black market for foreign exchange has been very weak in recent months, it has remained stable. During the end of April, it gradually lengthened due to tight credit. Who knew that the day after the end of the period, it would encounter this storm: In just one day, foreign exchange shrank by 25%, and gold surged past the 7,000 yuan mark. This unprecedented trend, because it happened so suddenly, almost made people lose their minds and the ability to think. All kinds of unreasonable rumors, even very clumsy and very laughable rumors, spread like wildfire and fiercely stirred people's hearts. Legal tender seemed to have really become the mark and ruble after the end of the last European war, even worse than the mark and ruble at that time. Those who were good at speculation no longer considered the danger and technique, just rushing to buy. The more fiercely the exchange rate and gold price rose, the stronger their buying fever. Those who were not good at speculation were even more blindly grabbing. Unable to squeeze into the gold and foreign exchange markets, they squeezed into various stores: not asking about prices, not asking about sales, not even asking whether it was useful to themselves, just grabbing goods. General stores, even large companies with good reputation, ignored their commercial credit and commercial morality, raising prices several times a day, even arbitrarily demanding prices. At the same time, there was also a run on deposits in banks and money shops; large deposits left the vault doors and ran from depositors' hands to the foreign exchange, gold, and general commodity markets. Everyone seemed to think that legal tender was about to become worthless waste paper, but they still used legal tender to buy goods; what the stores selling goods and the banks and money shops selling foreign exchange and gold received was also legal tender, and the reason why the general stores selling goods, banks and money shops selling foreign exchange and gold, etc., demanded high prices was precisely in the hope that the legal tender they received would be as much as possible. Legal tender is China's only means of payment, its qualifications unchanged in the slightest; and it will never change. All rumors that slander legal tender can actually be refuted long ago; now, recalling those who thought that legal tender was about to end its days in the past four days, shouldn't they laugh out loud? Not only should they laugh at their own stupidity, but they will also have to endure the consequences of this stupid behavior. The foreign exchange and goods exchanged for legal tender that was thrown out, because they underestimated the value of legal tender too lightly and neglected the true value and future of foreign exchange and goods too much, they can only endure the huge losses. Below, we might as well first analyze the rumors that have been pierced by the facts and their ridiculousness; then, based on the legal tender and foreign exchange themselves, we will speculate on what their future will be.

### China's US-Held Funds Increase

The US Treasury Secretary announced: As of the end of January 1940, the balance of China's short-term investments in the United States had increased by $1,706,000; while Japan had decreased with no increase. (Washington telegram on April 29, seen in this newspaper on April 30)

### "Gold Treasury Bills" and the Equalization Fund

Although the occurrence of this trend was too unreasonable, it is enough to give people a profound lesson. That is, the interests of legal tender and the Chinese people are so closely related. Precisely because their interests are so closely related, everyone except the Japanese puppets should support legal tender and maintain legal tender. What's more, it is a legitimate government representing a national country. However, in the speculative market, there have often been rumors of issuing so-called gold treasury bills. Although this absurd rumor has been repeatedly proven to be unfounded, it has been greatly active in the tide of resolution; and the general public is again doubtful and impulsive.

In terms of the interests of legal tender and the people, even in terms of the close relationship between legal tender and the war of resistance economy: the government must maintain legal tender with all its strength and cherish legal tender. This is already extremely obvious. Is there such a stupid government in the world? In wartime, when people's hearts are easily shaken, abandon the original currency system that has long been trusted and used by people all over the country and the world, and start a new stove to re-establish a new currency system. It is not easy to establish a new currency system that can gain the trust of the world even in peacetime, let alone in wartime?

Some may think that although legal tender is still circulating smoothly domestically, its value has already fallen externally. Therefore, it is better to stop the qualification of legal tender to purchase foreign exchange, and issue gold treasury bills to serve as the calculation standard for international exchange.

This is just the explanation of the rumor-mongers. In fact, if the government intends to raise the calculation level of international exchange, why did it let the external value of legal tender fall in the past? Moreover, if it intends to use such a large amount of funds to establish the external value of a new currency, why not use this fund to maintain the external value of legal tender? If you maintain the external value of legal tender in this way, wouldn't it be more effective and more economical? The repeated decline in the black market for foreign exchange in recent years is not because the government does not have the strength to maintain it; it is because the government intends to crush the Japanese puppets and speculators' arbitrage; and in considering the balance of international payments, there is no reason to maintain a fixed level on the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai for the Japanese puppets. The rumor-mongers said that the government will issue gold treasury bills, etc., which shows that they also tacitly acknowledge that the government does have the strength to issue gold treasury bills. Then, there is no need for them to worry about the government's strength to maintain legal tender! The fact that HSBC once stopped supplying, as well as the previous time it stopped supplying, can also prove that it has nothing to do with the strength of the foreign exchange equalization fund.

### Price Retreat in Britain and America

— Yu

World commodity prices had a shrinking trend in recent years; they only rebounded after the outbreak of the European war; but since this year, they have been retreating again. Even Britain is the same. We can see this by observing the shift in the price indices of Britain and the United States.

### United States Prohibits Withdrawal of Funds by Warring Nations

After the outbreak of war in Northern Europe, US President Roosevelt issued an order prohibiting Norway and Denmark from moving any of their funds in the United States. He also appointed US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau as the custodian of Norwegian and Danish assets to manage the transfer of their funds, so as to prevent the funds from falling into the hands of the Germans. As a result, Norwegian funds of $67,000,000 and Danish funds of $13,000,000 were frozen. (Washington telegram on April 29, seen on page 8 of this newspaper on April 30)

### "Restrictions on Withdrawals and Theft Cases Rise"

Since the Yunqiu Ma telegram, manufacturers have again created an atmosphere of restricting withdrawals to shake people's hearts, to fulfill their conspiracies to oppress the market and profit from it. This kind of rumor has been repeatedly spread and repeatedly proven to be unfounded, but people's hearts will be shaken again and again. This resolution has even triggered a run on withdrawals. The clumsiness of the rumor-making technique is extremely laughable; but it is even more pitiful and laughable that people are so easily swayed, blindly following again and again! To suppress speculation and capital flight, restricting withdrawals is indeed one of the effective means, but it is necessary to estimate its effectiveness in implementation. What was the effectiveness of the last Ma telegram? People are chattering about it, and we cannot bear to hear or ask about it. In short: since Shanghai's environment is special, the wise authorities will never repeat the same mistake and only cause confusion!

Rumors are always rumors, and now they have been proven to be rumors again: but friends who have believed in rumors and blindly followed withdrawals have had their property security greatly threatened. Please open the newspapers of the past two or three days. Theft cases have suddenly increased. Some people were even robbed of all their money on the way after withdrawing it from the bank.

### United States Prepares to Control Foreign Exchange

The US Senate has resolved to authorize the President to control or prohibit all foreign currency transactions in times of emergency. Senator Clark believes that "this is a step towards participating in the war." (Washington telegram on April 30, seen on page 7 of this newspaper on May 1)

### Reasons for the Drastic Change in Shanghai's Foreign Exchange

— Hu Tongrong

On the 2nd of this month, an unprecedented wave suddenly occurred in Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange. This was obviously due to the United Press's telegram reporting that the US government was considering lending aid to China to consolidate China's currency system. The telegram was misinterpreted and misrepresented by speculators, who falsely claimed that the foreign exchange equalization fund had been exhausted, thus setting off a monstrous wave of violent contraction in the black market for foreign exchange. The British exchange rate shrank to 3 pence 25 on the 2nd of this month, and then shrank further to 3 pence 125 in March. The US exchange rate fell to 4 yuan and 16 and 15/100ths cents, and then shrank further to 4 yuan and a half, becoming an unprecedentedly tight price, causing turmoil in the entire Shanghai market, disrupting the hearts of Chinese and foreigners, and causing prices to blindly follow and rise. As a result, the price of gold jumped by 1,000 yuan, with the highest call reaching 7,200 yuan. Other commodities such as cotton yarn, rice, grain, oil, beans, and coal all heard the news and rushed to stock up, and the market prices rose sharply. Although the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued a formal order to announce the detailed measures of this measure, gathering news from all parties, the government's temporary suspension of the supply of foreign exchange this time is entirely a measure to stabilize foreign exchange and find a new level. Now, let's clarify the points of misrepresentation of this sharp drop in exchange rates in society, and describe its significance below:

### Several Laughable Guesses

It is rumored that Britain will no longer maintain the Sino-British Equalization Fund, so China's currency system will decline in the future, and the United States will come out to maintain it. The stability of the legal tender's foundation and the exchange rate equalization fund are clearly two different things. Whether the legal tender itself is shaken does not necessarily depend on the abundance or deficiency of the reserve. Based on our experience of the past two years of the War of Resistance, the government's management of wartime currency and its efforts to balance international payments are enough to make the legal tender's reserve solid and difficult to shake. In addition, the constant large international loans to China and the continuous remittances of overseas Chinese back to the country can all promote the consolidation of the legal tender's foundation. Moreover, our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, possessing inexhaustible treasures. As long as the government and the people cooperate to develop production, they can find endless foreign currencies at any time to replenish the wartime exchange fund. The exchange rate equalization fund is established to facilitate foreign trade, and its nature is only to maintain ordinary trade between foreign merchants and China. Although its quantity is limited, it has always been a powerful institution for stabilizing the exchange market. Now, because the Exchange Rate Equalization Fund Committee has temporarily stopped supplying foreign exchange, to slander that Britain will no longer maintain it, isn't that a fallacy!

After the telegram of the temporary suspension of the supply of foreign exchange by the Hong Kong Equalization Exchange Fund Association reached Shanghai, it was rumored that it was due to problems with the Equalization Fund, and there was also deep fear that the HSBC McCallie Bank would abandon the exchange rate of 4 pence 125. As a result, people's hearts were all tense. However, in the past, the government's supply of foreign exchange to Shanghai has always been maintained by the Equalization Fund Committee. In the past, the dark market has shrunk twice, which was actually to combat Japanese puppet conspiracies and crack down on speculative behavior. Moreover, it is now heard that the government is planning to increase the foreign exchange fund (estimated at 5 million pounds and 7 million US dollars). It can be known that the strength of the foreign exchange fund will be even stronger in the future. The temporary suspension of supply this time is purely to liquidate the positions of speculators, so foreign exchange will be lengthened soon. The so-called exhaustion of the equalization fund is actually unfounded.

After the promulgation of the false Central Bank Law, it was rumored that the false Central Bank was about to be established. After its establishment, it plans to issue banknotes, exchange them for legal tender, and arbitrage foreign exchange. Therefore, the foreign exchange market seemed to add a kind of pressure. However, observing the Japanese puppets' attempts from "Mengjiang" to the..."United Bank" to the..."Huaxing," etc., wanting to hold a string of unprepared waste paper to exchange for legal tender and withdraw foreign exchange, but all of them have been properly dealt with by our government, and the strict precautions have made them unable to take advantage of the situation, and have successively failed. On the contrary, because the currency value of the yen group has been lowered, it has caused the depreciation of the yen. Therefore, if the false Central Bank issues false banknotes this time, it is nothing more than a change of face of "United Bank" and "Huaxing" tickets to cover up its past failures, so it is not enough to affect our foreign exchange fund.

### Please the Silver and Money Circles to Examine Their Consciences

During the end of April, the market prices of foreign exchange, gold, stocks, as well as rice, flour, yarn, flowers, etc., all fell miserably. Everyone said that this was the result of tight credit. As soon as the period passed, the speculative market prices of various commodities rose sharply again, and now they cannot be approached. Is this a reflection of the relaxation of credit? People have said that the silver and money industry in this city has stopped making loans for speculative goods. Judging from the tight credit in the end of April and the depression in the speculative market, it can be said to be credible. Then, where does the relaxation of credit now come from? Please the silver and money circles to examine their consciences.

### The Significance of the New Foreign Exchange Measures

Under the prevailing gold standard, a country's currency exchange rate was not fixed. If a certain exchange rate was no longer suitable for the national situation, forcibly maintaining it would not only be useless but also hinder the wartime economy. Especially in Shanghai, the economic center of the occupied area, although the government has lost its ability to govern politically, the current change in its past foreign exchange policy to implement a policy of limited foreign exchange supply is worth studying. Analyzing it reveals at least the following values:

Adjusting Import and Export Trade Since the outbreak of the war, one point has been particularly noteworthy in various trading ports: ports within the reach of the government have generally shown a trade surplus, while major ports in the occupied areas beyond the government's control have all experienced substantial trade deficits, especially Shanghai. Despite the government's repeated restrictions on imports and encouragement of exports, the output of local products has surged. According to the Jianghai Customs report for the first quarter of this year, the total import value was 148,389,858 yuan, and the total export value was 271,982,187 yuan, resulting in a trade surplus of 123,592,214 yuan. Although the figures seem to indicate a surplus, this figure is calculated based on the official exchange rate. If calculated based on the black market exchange rate, the national trade deficit in the first quarter of this year was 90 million yuan, with Shanghai accounting for 25 million yuan, leading to a sharp increase in the demand for foreign exchange. However, since the government cannot correct this directly, it has to find a new exchange rate in the market to reduce imports and increase exports of local goods, thereby replenishing wartime foreign exchange reserves. This is an effective method for the government, which cannot control trade by political means in the occupied areas.

Crushing the Japanese Puppet Regime's Foreign Exchange Speculation Since the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement, the Japanese side has used the huge amount of legal tender it collected from customs duties as a basis for speculating in foreign exchange. According to general estimates, in the past four months, the Japanese have speculated in foreign exchange with legal tender to the tune of tens of millions of yuan. Therefore, the use of a contracted black market exchange rate to combat the Japanese puppet regime's plot to speculate in legal tender is a good plan, but this method alone is not enough. It may be possible to adjust the foreign exchange supply in the dark market, so that the Japanese puppet regime has no way to speculate, or to reduce the possibility of speculation.

Reducing Imports of Japanese Goods: Japan, in view of the depletion of its yen reserves, absorbs foreign exchange and uses some of its surplus commodities to vigorously sell to the occupied areas in exchange for legal tender, which is then exchanged for foreign exchange. This promotion of surplus commodities has led to a surge in Japanese goods exported to China, reaching tens of millions of yuan in the first quarter of this year, ranking higher than the export values of all countries to China. Therefore, moderately restricting the supply of foreign exchange is tantamount to striking a blow to Japan's exports to China, making it impossible for them to obtain foreign exchange, or forcing them to exchange foreign exchange at a greater cost, so that their gains do not outweigh their losses. Then, the import of Japanese goods can be reduced invisibly.

### Random Talk on Yarn Prices (Part 2)

— Ma Zhaorong

The color of yarn is certainly related to the evenness of the texture. However, it is even more closely related to the color of the raw cotton. Even texture will naturally improve the color. And the color of the raw cotton directly determines the color of the yarn. White raw cotton yields white yarn. Lower-quality raw cotton yields lower-quality yarn. The color of the yarn has less impact on dyeing applications. However, buyers generally prefer white yarn.

What does twist mean? Twist is the number of turns per unit length in the yarn. The amount of twist is related to the length of the raw cotton, and standards vary from factory to factory. Generally, a higher twist results in stronger tensile strength. So factories prefer more twist. But it's important to understand that twist and output are inversely proportional! More twist means less output, less twist means more output. In terms of quality, less twist is better because it results in a softer texture. On the one hand, you need to consider the softness of the texture, and on the other hand, you need to ensure sufficient tensile strength, so you need to use an appropriate twist.

The above is about quality, now let’s talk about quantity.

How much does a bale of yarn (commonly known as a "piece") weigh? How is it packaged? Let me first explain the standard method. A bale of yarn weighs 400 pounds, containing 40 small packages, each weighing 10 pounds. Each 10-pound small package is further divided into yarn bundles equal to the yarn count. For example, 20-count yarn would have 20 bundles per small package. 16-count yarn would have 16 bundles. Each yarn bundle is further divided into 10 hanks, each hank being 840 yards long. In yarn factories, a hank is called a "heins." Each hank is further divided into seven leas, which are what I mentioned above. Each lea is 120 yards long.

Standard yarn factories spin yarn and package it according to this weight distribution. However, due to commercial competition, the weight of a bale of yarn has gradually exceeded the standard weight. First five pounds, then ten pounds, twenty pounds, thirty pounds, so that the weight of a bale of yarn increased to 480 pounds. Most bales on the market weigh about 420 pounds.

How are the extra pounds added to the bale? There are two basic rules: one is to add length, and the other is to add weight. What does adding length mean? It means increasing the length of the yarn. This method follows the standard packaging method but increases the size of the hanks. The weight of the added hanks is the extra poundage due to commercial competition. What does adding weight mean? Adding weight means increasing the weight of the yarn itself without changing the length, and packaging it according to the standard method. Adding length does not change the nature of the yarn, but adding weight does change the nature of the yarn. This is because yarn count and weight are inversely proportional. If the weight increases, the yarn count decreases. Of course, buyers hope to use the method of adding length to increase the weight of the bale, while factories prefer to use the method of adding weight. Because adding weight can increase output and make life easier. Therefore, to take care of both sides, factories often use a combination of adding length and adding weight.

What is the relationship between a factory's reputation and the price of yarn? In the market, aren't there so-called established brands and popular goods? The so-called established brands and popular goods are related to the factory's reputation. A factory that has been in business for a long time has an established brand. Because being in business for a long time means stable operations, reliable products, and obvious credit, the factory's reputation is good. The market competes for established brands, and these goods become popular. Scarcity makes things valuable, so the price of yarn that is produced in limited quantities and that everyone is competing to buy naturally increases. A factory's reputation is especially important in the current environment. Because during the war of resistance, when enemy sentiment is high, everyone competes to buy domestic goods. Domestic goods can be sold well in the mainland.

From the above, we can see that yarn prices are closely related to the quality, quantity, and reputation of the yarn. The quality and quantity of yarn are also very important to the factory's reputation. Good quality can create a good factory reputation. And the factory reputation guarantees the quality and quantity of the yarn. In the current market, it is even more important than the quality of the yarn itself.

### Japan's Labor Shortage

The extent of Japan's manpower shortage is even more severe than we realize. According to a report by Mr. Teruoka Yoshito and others, directors of the Japan Institute for Science of Labour, at a recent roundtable discussion at the Toyo Keizai Shimposha: In his village, with a total population of 3,000 people, there are now less than 20 young men, so all farming is almost entirely done by the old, weak, women and children. As for the factories, they are all staffed by female and child laborers. The working hours for child laborers are limited to 10 hours per day, but it is conceivable that the working hours for child laborers today have exceeded 10 hours. If there are any who have not exceeded 10 hours, they can of course now legally increase their working hours. The following table shows the ratio of increase in the number of workers in Japan's munitions industry in September 1939 compared to before the war.

### Coal Briquettes Rise Two Stages in Four Days, Increasing 48 Yuan Per Ton, Selling 9.4 Yuan Per Dan

The price of coal briquettes, due to the drastic changes in the foreign exchange market on the 2nd of this month, the industry discount, rose from 128 yuan to 158 yuan. However, the factory is greedy. Yesterday's father added 18 yuan, 176 yuan per ton, and another car to send. This street fighting village, delivered to customers, 188 yuan per ton, 23 yuan and five cents per cage, 9 yuan and four cents per ancestor is 48 yuan per ton higher than last week.

It is found that the price of coal briquettes, during the previous month, due to the expansion of the European war and the detention of the Norwegian ship, the factory excused that the source of the break, and the speed of the three disks in one month, all circles, complained about this, unexpectedly a month is not long, recently because of the changes in the foreign exchange market, each coal briquette factory also increased the cost as a name, continue to rise in price, two disks in four days, (the previous month was 128 yuan, on the 2nd, due to the prior order of the currency shrinking, the factories gathered to discuss the rise to 156 yuan, unexpectedly not two days, Yesterday's father added 18 yuan for no reason, the retail price per dan also rose from 7 yuan and four cents to 9 yuan and four cents, adding two yuan to the market, the speed of its rise, the giant, is unprecedented, people yesterday, all circles, although indignant, but the factory is still my way,

There are two large coal briquette factories in this city, with millions of dollars in assets. The raw material coal fines are purchased directly from foreign countries. (Such as Hongji No. 1 crumbs, No. 2 crumbs, Kaibao crumbs, are coal briquette raw materials), each batch of goods to three or four thousand tons, perennial deposit, less than ten thousand tons, enough for the city's supply for a month, dozens of small coal briquette factories, are looking forward to this, so the two factories, is the industry's leader, can manipulate the market, left and right market, in the past each price increase, are based on inventory and warehouse receipts for resistance, but as of now, old warehouse receipts have been limited to clean out, new warehouse receipts have not been issued, (that is, a factory still sends warehouse receipts, but limited to the 2nd, so the number is also micro,) is the coal fines stored in the stack, are low-cost, should be sold at the old price, is the right reason, and do not want to map this, only with the contraction of the exchange market as the standard, is what is different from selling with the advance, take a step back, that is, the ten thousand tons of inventory, are owned by customers, the coal briquettes made, are new price after goods, but according to the exchange rate calculation, the US dollar six yuan one two five shrink to four yuan eight seven five, also only hit a 30% discount, Now the coal briquettes are actually added to 40%, it is too much, so it is very important that the industry association can pay attention to this, do not arbitrarily raise, be criticized, increase the user burden, at the same time, the "flat sale of coal briquettes" can be extended to benefit the people, as for the ordinary users, more should not change in the face of difficulties, calm, do not purchase and store a large number of goods on the market, for the traitors to succeed, as a price increase.

### Restriction on Withdrawal - The Rumors Are Not Accurate

Last Saturday and Sunday, rumors suddenly spread in the market that the silver and money industry would once again restrict withdrawals this Monday, which immediately triggered a run on banks. The situation was most tense from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and the amount of withdrawals from various banks was indeed alarming. This may be because the previous two restrictions on withdrawals led people to believe that they might happen again amid the current surge in speculation, coupled with the instigation of those who undermine the legal tender, so they unknowingly believed it to be true. According to news from the silver and money industry, no order has been received from the ministry, and the rumors are generally inaccurate. Moreover, the Chinese banks in this city have always been operating steadily and have ample reserves. Based on observations from various sources, it is unlikely that a restriction will be implemented.

### Bank Clearinghouse Sets Interest Rate for April Clearinghouse Deposits

The Shanghai Bankers Association Clearinghouse has set the interest rate for interbank clearinghouse deposits for April at 6 yuan per 1,000 yuan (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.6%).

### Domestic Sugar Remains Expensive

Yesterday, the rise in foreign sugar prices seemed to have leveled off. The association quoted spot prices for 24 coarse white sugar, with new goods in foreign warehouses at 76.5 to 76.8 yuan, up 35 cents. Taikoo Chebai B Mark new goods were 76.3 yuan, and old goods were 75.8 yuan, up 30 cents. DY Mark was 73 yuan. For domestic sugar, Guangbang quoted Dongxiang Red at 57.5 to 59 yuan, up 1 yuan. Hainan Yang was 65 yuan, and Tiaoqing was quoted at 52 yuan, which can be described as extremely high.

### Glimpse of the Rise in Seafood Prices

The trade in various seafood items has not been sluggish in recent days. However, due to environmental factors, market prices have uniformly risen. For example, raw starch, including Flying Unicorn, Person Gun, 3X, KG, are all 68 yuan. Double A is 61 yuan, Double P is 60 yuan, 3C is 54 yuan, and C mark is 48 yuan, all up 8 yuan compared to before. Small and large-grain sago are both sold for 100 yuan, a sudden jump of more than 20 yuan. White pepper is making rapid progress, requiring 240 yuan. Dried mussels from Siam are currently priced at 190 yuan, up 30 yuan compared to before.

### Sluggish Hardware Transactions

Customers from various ports for hardware products, such as the Tianjin gang, Yantai gang, Qingdao gang, Fujian gang, Ningbo gang, and Hong Kong gang, have seen a significant decrease in actual sales in the past four or five days. This is due to the impact of the sharp decline in foreign exchange and soaring prices, resulting in a sluggish market. For example, black iron billets are still quoted at 1,400 yuan (2,000 pounds of original bundled goods). Tinplate hovers around 300 yuan, while the company's iron is 200 yuan outside the customs. Qing lead iron is also close to 200 yuan. Narrow strip iron is also selling for about 150 yuan.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Four-Character Inscription on Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Liyan

In peacetime, people often pay attention to clothing, food, housing, and transportation, striving for perfection. For clothing, they seek light, warm, delicate, and soft materials for single, padded, and cotton garments. For food, they strive for rich and palatable dishes. They build luxurious houses and use vehicles for transportation. Since the July 7th Incident, fleeing from airplanes and moving to remote rural areas, they found carrying too many clothes to be a burden. In harsh environments, they only feared not having coarse cloth and large shirts for peace of mind. For food, they often carried rough rice on their backs from several huang outside to fill their bellies. For housing, they rented stables and cow sheds, crowding together due to the large number of people, often sleeping on the ground. When news of alarms came, they often rushed and wandered for ten or twenty miles without feeling the hardship. Arriving in Shanghai, they faced high prices and difficult living conditions. An inch of cloth cost a thousand, a斗 of rice cost ten thousand. Living in cramped quarters, they struggled to make a home. Facing thorny paths, they found it difficult to take a step. Reflecting on the past and present, they were filled with emotion. Moved by these experiences, they wrote this four-character inscription to remember the past and encourage the future.

Clothing: In peacetime, it feels lacking; in times of chaos, it feels too much. Intended to cover the body, why use fancy materials? Having experienced the world, what will the future be like? It is better to be lacking than to go too far.

Food: A meal or a bowl of porridge is hard-earned. Not for gluttony, it becomes a burden. Human schemes are unkind; strive diligently. Labor your muscles and bones; strengthen your will.

Housing: Birds nest in forests, needing only a branch. Considering luxurious houses, why be extravagant? Drifting in wind and rain; experiencing hardship and displacement. Residing on an isolated island, be aware of danger in times of peace.

Transportation: Having feet but not using them, what is the meaning? I will walk, treating a steady pace as a carriage. Without hardship, advance and retreat freely. Thorny paths ahead; scratching my head and hesitating.

### My Opinion on the Problem of Selling Cotton Cloth at Low Prices

— Island Guest

Cotton cloth is indispensable for the clothing of the common people of Chu. No matter how thriftily and long-lasting old clothes are worn, there will eventually come a day when they cannot be mended or worn! Children are growing up every day, and old clothes are getting shorter and tighter day by day, so that they cannot be put on. To tailor new clothes, but cloth is as expensive as gold, and people dare not ask the price. Coarse cloth that used to sell for seven or eight cents or a 角 per foot before the war now sells for four or five 角, or six or seven 角! At least a 丈 (about 10 feet) needs a price of four or five yuan or six or seven yuan. How can a family of four or five people manage? And how can a family of seven or eight or more people manage? They (the common people) already feel exhausted in dealing with the two items of food and housing! Clothing is so expensive that they can only "sigh at the cloth"!

In the aristocratic families of a wealthy class, they wear silk, satin, brocade, wool, and serge. They disdain to wear cotton cloth (coarse cloth). Wearing old cloth gowns is considered shabby and rustic. How can they know that to the working-class common people, it is "something that cannot be obtained"!

I believe that the issue of holding a "cotton cloth fair" is an urgent need. Why not have the industry leaders of the weaving factories initiate a joint sale, sort out, gather, and discount the large and small remnants of coarse cloth stored in the factory, and sell them at low prices, limiting each person to buy four yards (one 丈) or eight yards (two 丈) to benefit the common people. We know that the cloth factories of the production organization, without the profit of middlemen, can be very cheap: even if sold at cost, it is an inescapable responsibility of the manufacturers to earn huge profits in times of great distress. Other cotton cloth dealers may as well weigh the pros and cons and hold a "cotton cloth fair," compensating for the loss of cheap cotton cloth with silk and brocade. Those who can afford expensive clothing do not care about the small increase in price. It is best if wealthy customers and cotton cloth merchants share the obligation of relieving the common people in an invisible way. I hope that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, together with the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Association, will lead and initiate a "cotton cloth fair" movement and actively promote it. The cloth factories should jointly organize it first and set a good example, so as not to let "cheap foreign rice" and "cheap coal briquettes" take the lead. In this difficult era, everyone should fulfill their responsibility to relieve disasters, which is to fulfill a glorious duty in the history of the War of Resistance and National Construction. Many working-class common people will benefit from it. I respectfully offer my heartfelt plea and bow nine times to express my sincerity.

### Food for Beginning of Summer

— Chen Nianyun

Plums: During the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Cao's army was marching, and the 800,000 soldiers were very thirsty and unable to move forward. Cao Cao, in his desperation, said that there was a large plum forest ahead, with a sweet and sour taste that could quench their thirst. Upon hearing this, the army immediately drooled ("looking at plums to quench thirst" was indeed a wonderful plan).

Rice Wine: One dan of glutinous rice costs forty yuan, which is really "hard to swallow."

Cherries: One by one, crystal clear and red, after seeing them, one cannot help but miss the "beautiful landscape" under Zijin Mountain and next to Stone Head.

Salted Eggs: Swallowing them one by one, we have now reached the stage of "perilous as a pile of eggs." Come on, get out of here quickly.

Bamboo Shoots: It is said that eating them can strengthen the waist and legs. I hope everyone, especially those who practice frugality, eats more and "walks steadily as a carriage."

### From the Problem of Housing to Calligraphy and Painting

— Book Explorer

For a person living in the world, the most important thing is the issue of housing. Comfortable and pleasant housing can prevent illness and prolong life. Therefore, the interior should have appropriate arrangements, such as flowers, plants, calligraphy, and paintings, displayed in the room for morning and evening enjoyment, enough to cultivate one's character and delight the emotions. It is more beneficial to body and mind to plant flowers, study calligraphy, and painting than to gamble. Moreover, it subtly teaches children, and the benefits are not insignificant.

From the 6th to the 12th of this month, the Daxin Art Gallery is exhibiting many famous people's calligraphy and paintings, such as the figures, ladies, and landscapes of the old master Qian Yunhe, the calligraphy of Xiao Kangshi, a disciple of Yan Duhe, and paintings of pine, bamboo, and plum, as well as the flowers and plants of Wang Yangqi, Wu Yezhou, and Zhang Yigu, and the inscriptions and poems of gentlemen Yan Duhe, Zhou Shoujuan, Gu Mingdao, and Zheng Yimei from the literary and art world, totaling no less than two hundred pieces. In particular, the characters of Yan, Zhou, Gu, and Zheng have never been exhibited once, and it is truly unprecedented to be able to gather in one place this time! (Pay)

### Cold Shredded Pork

Ingredients: Pork, ham, Chinese chives, winter bamboo shoots, cold vegetables, shiitake mushrooms, MSG, wine, soy sauce, salt, sesame paste.

Preparation: Choose lean pork belly, remove the skin and bones, and shred it. Also shred the winter bamboo shoots, ham, and shiitake mushrooms separately. Cut the Chinese chives and cold vegetables into three or four-inch lengths. Soak the shredded pork in wine first, then transfer it to soy sauce for a moment. When cooking, first put the shredded shiitake mushrooms, ham, and winter bamboo shoots into a pot, add water and bring to a boil. Then add the shredded pork and Chinese chives, along with an appropriate amount of MSG and salt, and cook for a moment. Add the Chinese chives, stir, and immediately plate. The operation should be quick, and it is better to cook over a low flame, otherwise the shredded pork will be old and tasteless, and the Chinese chives will lose their fragrance and color. When eating, put the cold vegetables on top and mix well with chopsticks. It is best to add a little sesame paste for a more fragrant and fresh taste. This is also a famous dish from Hai'ning. Cold vegetables are also called 洋菜 (agar-agar), and you must specify that you want the products produced by 宁波如生厂 (Ningbo Rusheng Factory) when buying, otherwise the origin is unknown.

### One-Week Budget Menu

— Ms. Ying

Fresh broad beans are on the market; this is the only delicacy among beans, and almost everyone, regardless of gender, age, loves to eat it. When they first come on the market, they cost two or three jiao per jin, which is really too expensive, and they are all from Hangzhou, so the bean nature is hard. The local goods are too small, the taste is a bit astringent, and they are not delicious. These days, the bean price has been lower, and you can buy a jin for one jiao. The Hangzhou goods are old, the skin is gradually hard, and you have to eat them after they come out of the shell. The local goods are gradually getting bigger, and the entrance is very glutinous, so you can eat them even with the shell. Add some diced bamboo shoots and cook them together, with a little bit of soup, and the taste is very fresh. In another half a month, then the shape of the beans will be as big as a fingernail, and it will be really good to eat after they come out of the shell. If you braise broad beans, lettuce shoot leaves, and diced meat together in rice, it will be ten times better than ordinary vegetable rice, even for people with a weak appetite, it can be appetizing.

### Philosophy of Riding the Tram

— Da Sheng

Third-class passengers appear to be inferior beings in the eyes of first-class passengers. Therefore, no matter how crowded the first class is, those upper-class people are unwilling to patronize the third class. They are willing to suffer this hardship themselves, and the third class becomes more spacious, allowing everyone to stretch their legs and engage in lofty discussions.

What is most annoying is the general "middle class." It is a pity that the tram does not have a "second class," otherwise, it would surely be filled by them. They look at the people in the first class and seem to feel that they are "poor," and they look at the third class and seem to think that they are "superior." Therefore, if they are in the first class, they have to be "humble," such as giving up their seats to upper-class female passengers. In the third class, they may as well be "arrogant," such as not having to give up their seats to country bumpkin, small-footed women, otherwise, it seems like they will lose their dignity.

### Fenghua Transportation: Xikou Bamboo Rafts

— Fuyun

Bamboo rafts are tools used in shallow rivers for transportation, used to replace boats for carrying goods. In the Wenzhou and Chuzhou areas of Zhejiang, as well as Xikou in Fenghua, bamboo rafts are used for transportation. Under the common circumstances of northerners being good at riding and southerners at boating, the effectiveness of bamboo rafts for crossing water is indeed little known to those who have not been there. The author has made a brief record for this publication, which I think the readers will be happy to hear. Fenghua is located in a mountainous area, and Xikou, the hometown of Chairman Chiang, is the opening of a waterway in the mountains. The mountain stream is originally named "Xi," so Xikou got its name. It belongs to the Shanyuan Township of Fenghua. The waterway from "Liu Shao," which is fifty li upstream from Xikou, down to "Xiao Wang Miao" and "Da Bu Tou," which are twenty li away, is all used for bamboo raft transportation. Due to years of mountain stones flowing downstream, the sides of the stream have become rocky beaches. (Below Xiao Wang Miao, it is all sandy beaches, and there are separate beach boats for transportation. There are no stones on the sandy beach, which is naturally formed.) The wide part of the stream has enough space for double-row (i.e., two bamboos per raft) to travel up and down, and the narrow part of the stream can only accommodate double-row to travel alone. The deep part can submerge people's shoulders, and the shallow part can only submerge the ankles. Sometimes, standing by the water, you can reach down and take stones. The rocky beach is about twenty to thirty zhang wide, mostly covered with pebbles. During the dry winter, even a single row cannot travel. Sometimes, on a ditch of water on the rocky beach, pedestrians can step over. Except for Xikou, which has water all year round due to its relatively flat terrain, the raft routes in places such as "Liu Shao Yi Bi Zhu" are interrupted from time to time, and it can only be used for six months of the year. The water in Xikou is deepest at Wenchang Pavilion. Looking down from the railing of Wenchang Pavilion, the clear blue water allows you to count the swimming fish. Wenchang Pavilion faces the mountains and overlooks the water, with beautiful scenery. The Chairman has built a building here, facing the grand building of Wuling School, which is a new building in Xikou after the Northern Expedition. It was previously reported that the war has destroyed it with Japanese aircraft bombs, making people feel the changes between past and present!

Bamboo rafts are made of the largest Mao bamboo. There are many Mao bamboo produced in the mountains of the area. Every year during the bamboo shoot season, it is also a kind of harvest for the villagers. The locals collectively call it "bamboo raft," divided into front and rear rafts, fastened together and traveling on the water surface. The rafts are fastened with bamboo strips, which are said to be stronger than any rope, and will not break when dragged. Each raft is made of ten of the largest Mao bamboos, tied together. The two ends of the center are connected with bamboo bolts, plus bamboo tips. The rear raft is flat and slightly shorter than the front raft. The bamboo roots of the front raft are connected to your roots in the rear raft;) the bamboo roots of the rear raft are in the front, and the bamboo tips are in the back;) The bamboo tips of the front raft are longer, and they are smoked with fire during production, at the front end of the raft, as an attachment for drainage. Where the water is turbulent, the water is quite fierce. When traveling downstream, it is said that if the raftman is not experienced in this way, and is not strong enough, it is really difficult to be competent. If you are not careful, the goods may fall into the water. Therefore, the people who pole the raft, standing on the front raft, are all veterans, and the people standing on the rear raft have slightly inferior skills. If it is a double raft (both front and back are two pieces joined together), it cannot travel without two people in front and back. A single raft can be poled by one person. Because the mountains are towering, the downstream (from top to bottom) is faster, and the upstream (from Xikou upwards) is very slow. The goods transported out of the mountains are mostly vegetables, medicinal herbs, and paper (all produced in Xinchang and Sheng counties). The upstream goods are all transported from Ningbo. There are fewer upstream goods. When the empty raft is driven back, the rear raft is stacked on the front raft and poled. When encountering a place that is difficult to go against the current, the poler goes down into the water and drags it across his back (at the curved tip of the front raft, there is a bamboo stick fastened, which is specially used for difficult driving, and the hand holds the stick against the poler's lower back to drag it upstream). When the raft is loaded with cargo, short square wooden sticks are used for padding to prevent the goods from getting wet. Passengers ride on the raft, either sitting on paper, or sitting on tobacco and medicine baskets. Local residents mostly bring a small bamboo backrest chair, and some also sleep on rattan chairs. Bamboo chairs and rattan bridges must be prepared by themselves. Since the advent of cars, there are fewer passengers. Because land transportation by car is not available, goods are still loaded on rafts. However, because the stream is dry at times, the raft cannot be used all year round, and the stones block the front of the raft, making it difficult to pass smoothly. The poler often moves stones aside to make way by the water. And because the raft is dragged on the stones, the raft is easily damaged. Those who transport more often have to replace the raft twice a year; at least once a year. Raft-making is done in winter. This stone mountain stream is a natural barrier to the mountains. It has been impossible to dredge for a long time, so it remains the same as before.

Note: Xikou is an important route for Xinchang, Sheng, and Tiantai counties to enter and exit Ningbo. Other than this, they have to go through the outer port. From Xinchang, Sheng, they go to Ningbo via Cao'e, by boat and car. However, the villagers are hardworking and have become accustomed to running around on mountain roads for one or two hundred li. Now that there are buses on the Yin-Fen (Ningbo to Fenghua) and Fen-Xin (Fenghua to Xinchang) highways, some villagers still trudge on foot. It is truly admirable.

Spring and Autumn

### A 20% Price Increase and Other Matters

— Jiantian

According to the reasons for the price increase of all goods, the biggest reason is "maintaining costs." In other words, the price increase is not for "profit," but only to "break even." This kind of openness, like an American "God is Good Store," is truly something we are endlessly grateful for; because doing business is about making a profit from the capital, and now they have truly achieved "serving" society sincerely. However, through the magnifying glass of the peep show, we can finally see clearly what is painted on the film.

On the second day of this major foreign exchange change, we received the following news:

(1) A certain large department store changed the prices of all goods overnight, increasing them by 10% to 30%.

(2) A certain large woolen shop stopped wholesale.

(3) There was no coal briquette available on the market (it was reported that the joint meeting of the factories of the Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association was aborted).

(4) Another department store wrote in large letters on the glass window, "All goods are uniformly increased by 20% according to the original code."

(5) …etc.

After Shanghai became an "isolated island," under the dual oppression of foreign exchange and "control," we naturally cannot completely blame merchants for hoarding and speculative manipulation of all kinds of goods; but they are at least indirect accomplices who are "adding fuel to the fire." The above examples are clear evidence of the facts.

Because even if they have no hoarded goods other than the batch of goods on the market, the pricing before the last two days has always been marked with the minimum profit margin. Can the "soaring" of the second day still be excused by "maintaining costs"? And the cessation of wholesale by a certain large woolen shop further exposed that they were hoarding a large amount of goods, taking advantage of the foreign exchange wave, waiting for the opportunity to greatly increase and specially increase, and make a big profit.

Therefore, I hope that the authorities of the two concessions can earnestly implement the "most severe sanctions" on the bulletin board. Otherwise, the security of the "isolated island" will face serious problems, needless to say; the future of the "isolated island" will also be handed over to others, giving them an opportunity to attack.

### What Should Be the Standard for "Living Allowances"?

— Chen Xinkui

Due to the continuous rise in prices, most people whose only income is salary have found it impossible to maintain their lives. For the sake of prolonging their lives, they have to demand "living allowances" from the capitalists. As a result, waves of "slowdowns" and "pay raises" have continued, and have become serious problems in Shanghai today, along with the ever-increasing prices of goods.

Due to speculation, manipulation, hoarding, transportation, taxes, controls, exchange rates, and costs, the current price increases have formed three patterns: one is the "high jump" type, which jumps up by several percent at once; the second is the "rise but no fall" type, which never falls once it rises; and the third is the "big rise and small fall" type, which rises by several yuan or tens of yuan at a time, but falls by only a few cents. Under these circumstances, people who depend on salaries to live, not to mention that those who cannot get a pay raise find it difficult to survive, even those who are lucky enough to get a few extra bills still live like they are living through a year, because the few yuan of allowance expenses that were bitterly requested last month have long been wiped out by the skyrocketing prices.

Originally, people who rely on salaries to live have very meager salary income, and they often cannot make ends meet every month. How can they withstand the endless "price increase wave"? When they cannot shrink any further and cannot save any further, and it is really difficult to survive, they are forced to ask for living allowances. Therefore, the repeated price hikes naturally raise the giant waves of "pay raises" again and again. Some wise companies and firms can understand the difficult situation of their employees and automatically issue additional allowances from time to time so that employees can settle in their positions. Unfortunately, many commercial firms, shops, or public and private occupational institutions only know their own interests and do not care about the suffering of their employees at all. They still regard the first and second demands for "living allowances" as a sign that the employees are not content with their lot. Only when the situation becomes tense and they cannot avoid issuing allowances do they add a few yuan as a kind of perfunctory measure, but they still bargain and haggle over every penny.

In fact, prices have risen to this point, and "living allowances" are already inevitable. So what should be the standard for the monthly allowance amount? The most appropriate method is to use the price index statistics published by the Public Works Department as the standard. For example, if we take the average price in 1937 as the basis, how many percent has it risen now? Then each person's salary should also be increased proportionally. This is a fair and just method, and there is nothing more fair than that. The government authorities should also stipulate this point as law, that is, the amount of salary should be based on the principle of being sufficient to maintain the minimum living standard of employees. When prices rise, salaries should be corrected at any time according to the cost of living index. In this way, the disputes over pay raises between labor and capital can be swept away, and there is no need to argue or contend, let alone resort to "slowdowns," "strikes," and "bargaining."

### New Contributions of Wormwood

— Qiang

According to reports, wormwood can prevent toxic gas. Putting these two medicinal plants into the nostrils or storing them in a gas mask can avoid the toxic gas. Even after poisoning, it can be fumigated with wormwood as an antidote. This is the latest contribution of wormwood.

For the sake of the cruelty of killing weapons, these preventive and remedial medicinal plants should be widely publicized to the world, so that everyone can know and use them at any time.

Wormwood is a mosquito repellent. Before the advent of various mosquito coils, it was already popular. The farmers in my hometown often pick wormwood in bundles in May and June, dry them in the sun, and burn them when the mosquitoes are as loud as thunder. In a few minutes, the mosquitoes disappear. The smell is similar to wormwood but more fragrant. When I smell it occasionally, my mind is refreshed.

As far as I know, there are various varieties of wormwood, such as green wormwood, white wormwood, male wormwood, and Yin Chen wormwood, but they are mostly the same, and they are all medicinal plants, or they are called yellow wormwood, which are different names for the same thing. Botanists will be able to describe them in detail.

As for wormwood, everyone knows it, so I won’t repeat it.

In short, if these two plants can resist toxic gas today, their contribution to the world is extraordinary, and I am happy to write it down. I hope that those who study medicine in the world can analyze and study the nature of these two plants in detail.

Chapter 23: Old Companions and New Friends, Literature is Valuable; Famous Scenic Spots are Well-Managed

Jin Danyun smiled and said, "Don't we have a saying, 'Escort the Buddha all the way to the Western Paradise'? We've already arrived in Suzhou, so we'll escort you to your school. So many people have come to escort you to school, including Mrs. Li Ya, aren't you satisfied?" Sure enough, after they escorted her to Soochow University, the car set off for Wuxi. At that time, they had already driven onto the road around the lake. There were newly built villas of people living along the lake. When they encountered beautiful scenery, they would stop the car and enjoy the scenery. Taihu Lake is said to have 36,000 hectares, and there are also 72 peaks inside. If you want to travel everywhere, it won't be a matter of a few days. At this moment, they are just viewing a rough outline. Around half past eleven, they had already arrived in Wuxi. Wuxi is an industrially developed area with very convenient water and land transportation. It originally held the central hub of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Recently, many branch lines have been opened on this railway. There are also branch lines opening out of Wuxi, but they are only short distances, probably because of industrial relations, which is convenient for transporting goods. When Wang Yu talked about the waterway, the ports have always been intertwined. They are all branches of Taihu Lake. After a reorganization, the sails come and go without obstruction. There are also new industries now that rely on electricity, and Wuxi is adjacent to a large electric factory in Qishu Yan, which is enough for the major factories in Wuxi, and even the power supply in Changzhou and Yixing rely on it. Therefore, when their family tour car approached the border of Wuxi County, they could see chimneys standing tall, puffing smoke. It is said that Jin Danyun and others drove to the Second Lake Ring Hotel, where the engineer Xue had sent someone to greet them long ago. He asked them to park the family tour car at the Second Lake Ring Hotel, and prepared two small cars to take them to Yuantouzhu. The Yuantouzhu at this moment is not the same as before. Many pavilions and towers have been built, but there are very few villas belonging to individuals. Originally, various places have recently had a landscape organization association. This landscape organization association is organized by local people. All scenic spots are either repaired or decorated, and are decided by the landscape organization association. Because the landscape of a place originally belongs to the public of the place and cannot be occupied by individuals. In that scenic area, there are recently several strict restrictions, such as not being able to build graves and not being able to put up advertisements. It would have been very sloppy before the war. As long as you had a few copper coins, no matter who you were, you would choose the most beautiful area to build a grave. When you are alive in the world, you are already annoying, and after you die, you still want to cover that ugly impression in front of people, wouldn't that be a great destruction of the scenery.
