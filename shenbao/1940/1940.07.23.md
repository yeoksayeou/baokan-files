### One-Day and One-Night Bloody Battle by Chinese Troops: Complete Recapture of Zhenhai County Seat; Street Fighting Erupted in the City Yesterday Morning, Japanese Unable to Sustain and Retreat; Japanese Troops on Both Banks of the Yong River Have Been Completely Eliminated

Jinhua: After days of siege by Chinese troops, Zhenhai City was captured at 3:00 AM today, and the Chinese Blue Sky White Sun flag once again flies over Zhenhai City, to the boundless joy and excitement of the people. (Dispatch of the 22nd)

Jinhua: Chinese troops in the Zhenhai area launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops who had advanced into the coastal and urban areas, engaging in bloody battles in places such as Qijiaoshan, Xiaogang, and Yinjiangnanshi. Japanese warships bombarded the Chinese with fierce artillery fire, but the Chinese troops advanced without retreat, with extremely high morale, pressing forward one after another, successively capturing all strongholds, further intensifying the pressure, driving the Japanese to the narrow coastal areas, and annihilating them in one fell swoop at 2:00 AM on the 22nd, thereby completely clearing the Japanese from the right bank of the Yong River. The Chinese army on the left bank also advanced bravely and rapidly, fiercely attacking Zhenhai County, charging and killing the enemy numerous times. Unable to sustain the pressure, the Japanese troops completely lost control of the county seat at 3:00 AM this morning. The Chinese troops, taking advantage of the victory, pursued and wiped out all remaining Japanese troops outside the city by about 5:00 AM. (Dispatch of the 22nd)

This Dispatch: After the Japanese navy secretly landed on the 19th and invaded Zhenhai's west gate, the city and surrounding areas immediately fell. However, the number of Japanese troops was very small. After a large-scale counterattack by the Chinese army, aided by 30,000 Chinese reinforcements in a day and night of bloody battle, Zhenhai was finally entered at 6:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd), completely recovering the city and surrounding areas. More than one hundred Japanese troops within the city walls were also completely annihilated. Important strongholds surrounding Zhenhai, such as Ma'anshan and Guniuling, as well as various forts, have all been recovered. The fall of Zhenhai this time was actually due to the reinforcements failing to arrive on schedule, which allowed the Japanese troops to break in. Guo Qiwu, the organizer of the maintenance association, upon hearing the news of the Chinese army's counterattack, immediately changed clothes and secretly fled the city and surrounding areas, scattering in all directions. As a result, the one-day-old maintenance association established by this side immediately disintegrated and vanished. It is reported that Mr. Wu and others have secretly gone to Ningbo to make representations to the Party, government, and military organs. Upon hearing of the recovery of Zhenhai, all sectors of Ningbo in this city were enthusiastic, actively engaged in rescuing wounded soldiers and providing relief to Zhenhai refugees, and are currently actively raising funds to provide relief to Zhenhai compatriots. As for the measures taken by the wounded soldier rescue committee, a decision has also been made after a meeting. (Dazhong News Agency)

This Dispatch: The shipping industry received a telegram from Ningbo at 4:00 PM yesterday, stating, "Bloody battle in Zhenhai lasted all night. Street fighting in the city. Japanese troops unable to sustain, collapsed and retreated at 11:00 AM. Zhenhai County completely recovered." The report of the recovery of Zhenhai has been completely confirmed. (Daguang News Agency)

This Dispatch: Before the recovery of Zhenhai County, the blockade line was also controlled by the remaining Japanese troops, who released speedboats to break through the plum blossom barriers. A medium-sized Japanese warship rushed into the blockade line the day before, seemingly attempting to go up the river. Therefore, the Chinese troops have been closely monitoring it. As of last night, the Japanese warship that rushed into the blockade line had not moved. In a certain section of the Yong River, the Chinese river defense troops have built two new, very strong blockade lines. The Caisteng Wheel (weighing over 300 tons, costing 400,000), the Yongmin Wheel (weighing over 100 tons, costing about 600,000), and the Ningshao Sanbei Hongxing Gaodeng piers have all been moved to the river surface of the new blockade line and sunk to fortify the river defense. (Datong News Agency)

This Dispatch: According to inquiries from Ningbo groups in Shanghai, the situation report of the Zhenhai battle yesterday is as follows: (1) Important strongholds such as Qingzhizhen, Ma'anshan, Lintangjia, Guniuling, and Changtiaozui had already been captured by the Chinese army by noon yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese troops entrenched outside the west gate of Zhenhai at Lanpu Bridge. The Japanese troops retreated in disarray, and the Chinese army is pursuing them. Currently, the Japanese army's reinforcements have been cut off, and they are exhausted and unable to hold on. The vanguard of the Chinese army has approached Zhenhai County to within about three li. The Chinese and Japanese armies in the Zhenhai urban area and Jiangnan area are still holding their original positions, with no major changes. There are no traces of Japanese troops at Wanjia Bridge in the west of the city. (2) Eight Japanese warships were anchored outside the mouth of Zhenhai yesterday, and fourteen more were added today, totaling twenty-two. One of the Japanese warships broke into the blockade line, and the Chinese army is closely monitoring it. Our ×× new blockade line has been completed and is exceptionally strong. In addition, three Japanese warships have sailed from the Xiangshan Qiancang waters, and one Japanese warship is anchored at Hengshan, with no unusual movements. (3) At 5:40 AM this morning, the air defense sentry issued an emergency air raid alert. It is reported that three Japanese planes were discovered over Longshan. The sound of planes was heard in this city, but the planes' whereabouts were unknown. The alert was lifted at 7:04 AM. At 7:45 AM, the air defense monitoring post issued a second emergency air raid alert. Japanese planes passed over the city, dropping four bombs in Meixu. One bomb landed at Qiujing Elementary School, destroying one house. The other three bombs landed in wasteland, causing no damage. (4) At 6:03 PM this afternoon, the air defense monitoring post issued an emergency air raid alert. Two Japanese planes were discovered over Longshan. (Datong News Agency)

Report That Japanese Landed on Sandu Island Is Incorrect

This Dispatch: Since the Japanese side blockaded Zhejiang and Fujian on the 16th of this month, followed by Japanese troops attempting to land on the coast, according to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 21st, the Japanese navy had landed on Sandu Island, fifty miles northeast of Fuzhou. According to inquiries from various sources, this is incorrect. (1) According to the Shanghai-Sandu telegraph of the Ministry of Transportation Waterline Telegraph Bureau on Edua Road, telegrams are being received and sent as usual, and the bureau has received information that the Japanese have not landed on Sandu, and all work is proceeding as usual. (2) According to the Fujian Fellow Association and Fuzhou merchants in Shanghai, Sandu is close to Fuzhou and is one of the northeastern gateways of Fuzhou. If there were any accident, Fuzhou would not fail to report it by telegram. Today, the association has received only ordinary commercial telegrams and no other news, indicating that the report of the Sandu landing is purely inaccurate. (Note: Sandu is a small island located northeast of Fuzhou and southeast of Ningde. There is a considerable amount of foreign property on the island. Since Sanduao was blockaded by Japanese warships in the second half of last year, water transportation between the island and other places has been interrupted. (Pingming News Agency)

### Fierce Battle Over Chongqing: Chinese Troops Shoot Down Two Japanese Planes; Over 120 Japanese Planes Attacked Chongqing in Four Waves; Only Dropped Bombs in the Suburbs, Escaping After Being Pursued by Chinese Troops

Chongqing: Two Japanese planes flew over Chongqing for reconnaissance. In an air battle lasting ten minutes, both planes were shot down by Chinese planes. The two Japanese planes were clearly intending to take photos of Chongqing in order to bomb it according to the map next time, but unexpectedly, they were both shot down by Chinese fighter planes waiting to intercept them. In the past week, the weather has been overcast and rainy, so there have been no Japanese planes over Chongqing, and it has been very quiet. After the two reconnaissance planes were shot down, the air defense headquarters received a report that eighty or ninety Japanese bombers had left Hankou, attempting to retaliate. Therefore, an air raid alert was issued here, and Chinese fighter planes also took off to circle and intercept the attackers. However, no Japanese planes were sighted until 3:30 PM, and the alert was lifted at that time. Although it was reported that Japanese planes had bombed nearby small towns, they did not penetrate into the Chongqing area. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)

Chongqing: This afternoon, a hundred Japanese bombers attacked cities north and south of Chongqing in four waves. Although the Japanese planes did not reach the airspace over Chongqing City, residents took shelter in air raid shelters for nearly three hours. The first wave of Japanese planes bombed the Hechuan River (transliteration) north of Chongqing on the Jialing River. The second and third waves of Japanese planes circled over Beipei Hot Springs, which is also located on the Jialing River north of Chongqing, about halfway between Hechuan and Chongqing. However, it is reported that the Japanese planes did not drop bombs in the hot spring area. The fourth wave of Japanese planes, mostly coming from the same direction as the second and third waves, bombed the Jiangnan Sichuan Highway and cities south of Chongqing. Chinese fighter planes patrolled the airspace over Chongqing, waiting for the enemy planes, but they never arrived. It is reported that the Chongqing area issued an alert at 12:30 PM and lifted it at 3:20 PM. Also, this morning, officials confirmed that a Chinese fighter plane shot down a Japanese reconnaissance plane in a thrilling battle over Chongqing. It is also reported that another Japanese reconnaissance plane was also shot down. It is said that two Japanese planes were discovered circling over Chongqing City before 9:00 AM this morning, conducting reconnaissance. Five Chinese fighter planes immediately took off to intercept them. The Chinese planes dived to attack the Japanese, strafing them with machine guns. The people of Chongqing heard the sounds of machine guns and planes in the air and all ran to open spaces, watching the air battle. After several minutes, they saw two Japanese planes fall. It is reported that one of them crashed in the mountains on the western outskirts of Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)

Chongqing: Every time Japanese planes attack Chongqing, they use their high-speed reconnaissance planes to conduct reconnaissance of the route in advance. Except for one that was shot down by the Chinese on June 12, the others have all slipped through the net. At 9:00 AM on the 22nd, a Japanese reconnaissance plane flew into the city airspace again, using its usual tricks. The Chinese Air Force was prepared and used two of the latest fighter planes to attack fiercely from behind. After only a few shots, the Japanese plane caught fire and crashed in Pengjia Garden. The citizens witnessed this and were all delighted. The reporter went to inspect and met Chief He, Commander Mao, and Director Zhang Zhizhong, who were returning from a visit, their expressions full of joy. Villagers along the way competed to visit, causing traffic to be blocked. The front part of the Japanese plane was shattered everywhere, and the rear part still had an empty shell. The nose of the plane crashed into a stream, and the wings were burned. The machine guns, radio, and camera in the plane have all been recovered. The plane body was marked with the Japanese type "98", and the tail had the numbers "861-3". The pilots were Captain Kato and Lieutenant Kuwahara, their bodies mangled and incomplete. At that time, villagers and soldiers competed to bury the Japanese corpses and carry the wreckage of the plane. At about 1:00 PM, more than 120 Japanese bombers attacked the capital in four waves. They flew close to the suburbs, but because their reconnaissance plane had been shot down by the Chinese and they had lost their eyes and ears, and because the weather was overcast and rainy and the Chinese were well prepared, they never dared to fly in and dropped bombs in the suburbs before escaping. (Dispatch of the 22nd)

Chongqing: More than 120 Japanese planes, at around 2:00 PM on the 22nd, attempted to attack the capital but failed, and flew to Hechuan, Qijiang and other places to drop bombs, escaping eastward. Dozens of bombs landed in Qijiang, causing three fires, which were immediately extinguished. More than ten people were killed or injured, and the rest landed in the wilderness. The situation of the bombing in Hechuan is still under investigation. (Dispatch of the 22nd)

Editorial

### Far Eastern Policy in the American Political Season

Now that the incumbent U.S. President Roosevelt has accepted the nomination for a third term as president, how should the U.S. government and people continue to advance their firm international anti-aggression policy during the period from now until the election? This newspaper commented yesterday, summarizing what we hope for. Today, please elaborate on the inevitable trends thereafter.

Washington dispatches from the U.S. system yesterday and today: One said that this year's Congress has no intention of urging the United States to adopt a new policy in the Far East; another said that they do not believe that Congress will take any clear steps to deal with Japan; and another said that observers are now paying attention to what extent President Roosevelt will be bound by the Democratic Party's isolated foreign policy: and another said that before President Roosevelt defeats his political opponents in the election, all policies will probably take a stable and moderate path. All of this is said to be a certain percentage of the news, revealing the content of the U.S. political situation; the remaining percentage is of the nature of discussion, explaining the impact of the U.S. political situation. The size of the percentage occupied by the two types of nature. No one can tell. However, with the development of the American spirit of democracy, the political strategies of the two parties before the American election, and the historical precedents shown in American political history, anyone has no doubt that the above news and discussions are extremely pertinent. We also believe that in a politically enlightened country like the United States, where people are political animals, these are political issues, and the current period is a political season, so this half-news and half-discussion will bring the political atmosphere to the fullest. Fundamentally, a political human society cannot fundamentally eliminate the political atmosphere to the point of achieving a trans-political bright period with any majority belief, sound reason, or special fact. This is not only the case in the United States, but also in any democratic country. Even in countries controlled by extremely narrow-minded nationalists, no matter how much their rulers subjectively yearn for trans-politics, they are in fact inevitably like this. Generally speaking, the people who are most politically conscious are most easily confused, but they should not be too confused, and they must know that the political atmosphere is not the deciding factor of everything for a nation. If everything is determined by the nation and the choices are inseparable from the political atmosphere, if the observations or discussions of everything about the nation are based only on the political atmosphere, then it is only a politician, a strategist, or a polemicist. If this is the case, it is an omen of the nation's decline and a seed cause of the destruction of the democratic political system.

Specifically, regarding the current United States: although the most important political season that comes once every four years is approaching due to the presidential election, although international policy has become a political issue because it has become a tool of political struggle; however, there are some serious matters, especially those related to the Far East, that have either actually reached a fork in the road where the United States must make timely decisions; or are evolving rapidly, pushing to the point where the United States will obviously have to declare a clear attitude in a timely manner before the election in November; or more possibly, what unexpected and serious new disturbances will arise, requiring the United States to be prepared to deal with them immediately; For all three types of matters, we do not believe that the wise U.S. government and people cannot restrain their political atmosphere to the lowest limit, and allow whatever international policy issues are placed before them in the next three months to remain in the realm of domestic political issues due to the political season. Let's make a few hypothetical examples that are not impossible: Suppose that after the completion of the Konoe Cabinet in Japan, as has been widely rumored by the Japanese side and rumored by other countries, it brazenly invaded the scope of what the United States absolutely cannot tolerate in terms of its Far Eastern policy or Pacific security in terms of diplomacy or other practical actions; Suppose that incidents like the insults suffered by the New York Times Far East correspondent Abong, which are more serious and magnified, continue to occur and escalate; Suppose that Britain, again citing the weakness of the United States' attitude and actions in the Far East, prepares to take some retreating action in a last resort posture that despises treaty obligations and sacrifices the interests of the United States and other countries. No one dares to guarantee that these assumptions will never come true; Moreover, with the international situation becoming increasingly turbulent in recent years, and moving further and further away from common sense, reason, and morality, even the sudden outbreak of countless events that are more distant and keenly felt should not be considered unexpected or dismissed as groundless fears. Therefore, in the American political season, before the general election, it cannot be asserted that the U.S. authorities' dealings with the international community will necessarily become negative.

Moreover, from the perspective of the political strategy of political struggle, the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States are opposed to each other in the government and the public. However, the international policies declared to the people before the election only differ in tone and degree, and there is no divergence in action; Therefore, although international policy has unfortunately fallen into the realm of domestic political issues, the two parties have taken it as a tool of political struggle, and it is very likely that they will strive to compete under the common principles of anti-aggression and non-compromise, and finally reach a saturation point where the will and strength of the two parties in the country merge into one. It is precisely the political season, and in front of the crowds, the brilliance of justice and the flames of national honor can make those who appear to be stable and moderate and passive unable to argue and have nowhere to stand. In the near future, the Japanese Konoe Cabinet will inevitably stimulate the United States, at least for its inherent political reasons; yesterday's New York dispatch stated that although the Roosevelt government wants to avoid disputes with foreign countries before the election, the anti-American incidents that have occurred in the Far East in recent days will make moderation shameful for the general public; With various subtle causes lurking, there is absolutely no reason to assert that the United States' policy toward the Far East will be temporarily stagnant in negativity, that is, it is not difficult to discern its direction.

### U.S. Congress Reopens to Discuss National Defense Bill; Ban on Scrap Iron Shipments to Japan Must Be Implemented; Used to Counter Blockade of Yunnan-Burma Road

Washington: The U.S. Congress has reconvened today and begun to discuss the $48 billion national defense bill, and is preparing to debate the compulsory military training bill. Political circles believe that Congress will continue to meet in the summer to conclude various outstanding cases, and there is no hope of adjournment in the near future. Democrats advocate that Congress should continue to meet until September 1, while Republicans insist that Congress should meet continuously during the European war, regardless of how long it lasts. Secretary of the Navy Knox and Chief of Naval Operations Stark will request the House Appropriations Committee to approve funds to begin building a navy that exceeds the fleets of all the great powers. Also, the Senate Army Committee has completed the review of the compulsory military training bill of Burke Waterworth, and the final draft of the bill can be prepared within this week. The Senate Army Committee may also approve the summoning of the National Guard, so that President Roosevelt can summon the National Guard. Well-informed sources said that President Roosevelt may enlist 50,000 people for training after the Senate passes it. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)

Washington: Diplomatic circles now believe that the United States may discuss banning scrap iron shipments to Japan to counter Japan's blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road. This belief in diplomatic circles is based on the following two facts: (1) Secretary of State Hull's opposition to the blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road; (2) Colonel Stimson's appointment as Secretary of War; (3) The recent authorization by Congress for President Roosevelt to control the export of major national defense raw materials, and scrap iron must be included in the list of banned items. Several powerful individuals and private groups in the United States have long advocated banning scrap iron shipments to Japan, but the State Department has been slow to implement it because there is no legal basis for this action. Well-informed sources said that Colonel Stimson has repeatedly advocated banning the shipment of weapons, ammunition, and all military raw materials to Japan. In January, he even publicly wrote a letter to the New York Times, urging the United States to take this action. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)

### If the U.S. is Directly Threatened, It Will Immediately Send Troops to Participate in the War: A Senator's Remarks

Washington - Senator Thomas, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently told a United Press reporter that he believes the Democratic foreign policy will allow U.S. troops to be sent outside the Western Hemisphere if the Philippines, Hawaii, or any place in the Western Hemisphere is attacked. Thomas also stated that the Democratic platform stipulated that the U.S. would never participate in foreign wars unless attacked, and would not send naval, land, or air forces to foreign lands outside the Americas. However, this platform has already left room for the U.S. to participate in foreign wars. If aggression in any place is sufficient to threaten the U.S., the U.S. will certainly participate in the wars in Europe or the Far East. For example, an attack on the Philippines or Hawaii can be considered an attack on the U.S. The same interpretation can be applied to attacks on islands in the Western Hemisphere or any American people. It would be extremely foolish to draw boundaries to tell the enemy that the U.S. will only attack when the enemy invades these boundaries. If the U.S. allows a certain enemy country to acquire military bases in the Western Hemisphere by conquering an island or controlling Latin American countries, wouldn't that give the enemy the benefit of free action? Once attacked in the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. will immediately send troops to fight, and there is no doubt about that, he said. (United Press Dispatch, 22nd)

### Pan-American Conference Will Discuss Territorial and Economic Issues: First Meeting Held Yesterday, Hull Delivered a Speech; Cuban President Urges Preparation for Self-Defense

Havana - The Pan-American Conference opened here yesterday to consider all economic, military, and territorial issues affecting the Western Hemisphere due to the European war. Cuban President Bru delivered an opening speech, stating that the American countries "must take it upon themselves as the sacred task of guardians of a civilization that has not yet been sold out." He urged the American countries to quickly prepare all "active self-defense work." This speech is the outline of this conference, expressing without reservation the principles of democracy, peaceful laws, and service to others, calling it the motivation in American history. The representatives of the participating countries will listen to the speech of U.S. Secretary of State Hull at the first plenary session today. It is strongly implied here that before the territories and activities of France and the Netherlands in the Western Hemisphere are discussed and resolved, the U.S. representatives may try to delay the consideration of economic proposals. In today's meeting, a conference-wide committee may be organized first, and then subcommittees will be appointed to discuss all issues of neutrality, self-defense, peace, and economic cooperation. (United Press Dispatch, 22nd)

Havana - U.S. Secretary of State Hull has already had a conversation with the representatives of the participating countries yesterday. It is reported that he has learned that all representatives recognize the necessity for the American countries to take joint action to determine the future fate of the West Indian territories. It is heard that Hull will express the U.S.'s attitude towards the West Indies in his speech and will announce methods to deal with sabotage activities in the Western Hemisphere. (United Press Dispatch, 22nd)

Havana - Cuban President Bru, in his address at the opening of the Pan-American Conference, called for unified solidarity between the two continents. He stated, "The countries of the Western Hemisphere must prepare to actively protect common rights." During the first meeting, the representatives of various countries and U.S. Secretary of State Hull sat solemnly in the tall building with a magnificent dome. However, when the German representative arrived, a tense atmosphere immediately arose. Tense behind-the-scenes diplomatic activities were already underway, as those who had the most at stake in the conference were striving to resist the potential for the German side to obstruct the progress of the conference. The representatives of various countries are now eagerly awaiting Secretary of State Hull's speech this afternoon, as he may clarify U.S. policy and plans for the conference at that time. It is rumored that Hull may announce a surprising plan in the next few days, in which he may cede economic rights to other republics in exchange for their cooperation in resisting the military and economic intrusion of totalitarian countries. Currently, all Latin American republics except Argentina are able to cooperate with the U.S., but it is heard that the Brazilian representative is now working hard to get Argentina to join this group. Currently, all parties' interests are focused on President Roosevelt's proposal to organize a Pan-American economic alliance, which is expected to be discussed at this conference. The former German minister to Chile, Mr. Lissner, is now leading the German delegation to work against the conference. They intend to persuade the American representatives, saying that Germany is bound to win, and therefore it is unwise for them to adopt business plans that are unfavorable to Germany. The Cuban secret police are now closely monitoring the 40,000 Spanish Fascists in Cuba who are cooperating with the German side. (International News Service Dispatch, 22nd)

New York - The Pan-American Conference opened in Havana, the capital of Cuba, yesterday, with representatives from the 21 republics of the Americas in attendance. Yesterday's program consisted of the opening ceremony and a welcoming speech by the Cuban President. The conference will begin to handle business today, starting with speeches by U.S. Secretary of State Hull and the chief representatives of Cuba and Paraguay. This meeting was convened to consider various issues arising from the war situation. It is expected that the discussions will include a proposal for the 21 republics to establish a joint protection system for the territories in the Western Hemisphere belonging to European countries that have been invaded, and a plan proposed by the U.S. to organize a Pan-American group to deal with the surplus production of various American countries. Informal private discussions have already taken place among the representatives of the various countries, and it has been found that the conference faces several difficulties. According to a dispatch from the New York Times Havana correspondent, the delegations want to actively cooperate to maintain peace in the Western Hemisphere, but the gap between North America and South America still exists in terms of economic and political unity. The South American representatives are very willing to consider any proposal from the U.S. to solve the problem of losing markets due to the war, but there are doubts as to whether the U.S. plan is suitable for practical use. As for preserving peace in the Western Hemisphere, the conference will probably discuss how to deal with disruptive forces without involving military mutual assistance issues. According to a New York report, many Latin American countries believe that without miraculous and unpredictable political skills, no clear results can be produced. (Reuters Dispatch, 22nd)

### New Governor-General of Vietnam Sworn In, Vows to Eliminate Internal and External Crises and Defend Vietnam's Position

Saigon - The newly appointed Governor-General of French Vietnam, Vice Admiral Decoux, was sworn in yesterday and delivered a speech, calling on the residents of Vietnam to abandon sectarianism and work together to revive France and Vietnam. His speech stated briefly: French compatriots and Vietnamese people, although the current situation is extremely difficult, I am taking office as Governor-General of Vietnam with full confidence. Except for fifty years, Vietnam has been ruled by naval officers at all other times, and the foundation for Vietnam was also laid by naval officers. I will naturally follow the legacy and continue to work hard, so that I can be worthy of the glorious cause of my predecessors. In addition, I also concurrently serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the French Fleet in the Far East and will naturally take it as my responsibility to safeguard France's position in the Far East. Our country has owned great colonies in Asia for nearly a hundred years, and this position has been proven by history and praised by various countries. From then on, I will cooperate with local government offices and military commanders to eliminate internal and external crises and defend Vietnam's position. I dare to ask you to put personal issues and party politics aside and focus on the revival of France and the future of Vietnam, and I wish you closer cooperation and more effective results. Furthermore, unity between superiors and subordinates is the foundation of the French nation's spirit of nation-building, and this spirit is especially necessary during this time of national crisis. French Vietnam is still able to maintain peace, maintain discipline, and work as usual for this reason. I am willing to encourage you all. (Havas Dispatch, 22nd)

### German Newspaper Comments on U.S. Gold Policy: Reorganization of European Economic Life; No Way Out for Gold in the Western Hemisphere

Berlin - Yesterday, Dr. Wintschuh, the economic editor of the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, published an article entitled "Looking Back from the Year 2000" on the issues of post-war reparations and the world economy. He stated, "In the autumn of 1940, the U.S. owned 80% of the world's gold reserves. The U.S. has gained enormous benefits from the war, and this situation is exactly the same as after the World War. Americans believe that gold can give them control over new economic relations, but the development of the situation proves otherwise. Previously, the European currency system was based on gold, but because Germany defeated Britain, the pound sterling collapsed, and European economic life has been reorganized without using the gold standard, which is contrary to people's expectations. The victorious countries do not demand reparations in gold or refined goods as the countries of Versailles did. In the past, attempts to resist the clearing trade methods of totalitarian countries based on gold trade have failed. The current situation has changed because European banks refuse to buy gold, and the world economy is developing according to the principles of totalitarian countries. As a result, the remaining gold is transported to the U.S. As a result of the U.S. hoarding huge amounts of gold, all other countries in the world have no choice but to resist the U.S. economically. The U.S. woke up from its gold dream and found that it wanted to buy goods with gold, but no one needed gold. Although it used various methods to find gold buyers abroad, all failed. There is absolutely no way out for gold in the Western Hemisphere. South America asked the U.S. to sell its surplus products, but the U.S. was unable to do so. South America then resold to its old markets, still conducting a barter trade with Europe even after the outbreak of the war? Although Europe absorbed this trade, it also wanted to develop Africa as a source of raw materials. At this time, the U.S. reduced the purchase price of gold and finally completely stopped buying gold. However, this measure made the value of gold even lower. At this time, Washington planned to lend gold bonds to Europe, but they were all rejected. Finally, the U.S. planned to donate half of its gold to Europe and establish a gold standard currency system as a condition for world trade, but this gift was also rejected. At this point, the U.S. mint minted gold coins to arouse personal interest in gold, but this attempt also failed. No one wanted to carry heavy gold bars, and people still preferred to use bank notes and checks. No one wanted to pay with gold, only estimating the value according to the amount of goods that could be purchased with their deposits. Finally, the gold was melted and cast into gold utensils for the tables of U.S. ministers and ambassadors, as a commemoration of the past years. Wall Street was renamed Gold Street." This is the end of the gold flowing into the U.S. (Haitong Dispatch, 22nd)

### U.S. to Hold Large-Scale Army Maneuvers, with 300,000 Soldiers Participating, Unseen in 20 Years

New York - The U.S. Army will hold large-scale maneuvers within the next week. It is heard that as many as 300,000 soldiers will participate. Such a large-scale exercise is the only one the U.S. has seen in 20 years. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)

### U.S. Political Interests in the Dutch East Indies are Greater Than Economic Interests

Attleboro - According to a research report by the Pacific International Relations Research Institute, the U.S. relies more on the British Malayan Federation for material resources than on the Dutch East Indies. The U.S.'s economic interests in the Dutch East Indies are relatively light, while its political interests in that area are very significant. During his research on the various existing economic and political factors in Asia, Dr. Kier, an expert at the Pacific International Relations Research Institute, discovered that the U.S. would never sit idly by and watch any change in the situation that would put the supply of vast, inexpensive materials into the hands of the conqueror. The recent situation in Europe has not only resulted in the occupation of the Netherlands but has also put Britain at risk of being conquered. This situation has made the aforementioned U.S. attitude even clearer. Kier's report continued, judging from both Latin American rubber production and synthetic rubber production, the U.S.'s reliance on the Dutch East Indies is very slight, because the U.S. has now concluded an agreement with Brazil, which stipulates that the U.S. will assist Brazil in the mass production of various subtropical agricultural products needed by the U.S. These agricultural products include rubber, quinine, vegetable oil, and several types of hardwood. These items are all supplied by Asian countries to the U.S. In addition, Latin America has spent a great deal of effort in preventing diseases in rubber production and has largely overcome these difficulties. According to reliable sources, the production of this rubber can be greatly developed within five years to meet commercial needs. Regarding tin, although the tin mines in Bolivia and the Belgian Congo do not have sufficient output to meet world needs, they can also provide temporary relief in times of emergency. Therefore, regarding rubber and tin, the U.S. can still obtain supplies from the Americas in times of emergency. The report continued, the U.S.'s extraordinary concern for the fate of the Dutch East Indies is obviously not only in terms of investment and trade figures. In fact, putting forward the two ends of investment and trade figures is sufficient to prove that the U.S.'s economic interests in the Dutch East Indies are not very important. If we study the Dutch East Indies alone, the argument that the U.S. depends on the Dutch East Indies for military raw materials is also broken, because the rubber of the Dutch East Indies accounts for only 25% of what is consumed by the U.S., and tin accounts for only 5%. Even if the Dutch East Indies is occupied by other countries, it is still questionable whether the exports of the Archipelago, Malaya, Burma, Vietnam, and even most of Siam would be prevented, because producers are willing to sell their goods to good customers. If, due to political relations, the occupiers strive to prohibit the shipment of these exports, it is also questionable whether a complete blockade can be achieved, because convoys can still transport these prohibited goods to the U.S. If the Suez Canal and Gibraltar cannot be passed, they will detour around the Cape of Good Hope to reach the east coast of the U.S. Furthermore, viewed from the perspective of so-called major commodities, the goods imported by the Dutch East Indies are not as important as those imported by other Southeast Asian countries.

### Remittances Difficult in Various Parts of France

Vichy - According to the Petit Journal yesterday, the most difficult problem for the French postal service at present is the inability to mail money orders between the occupied and unoccupied areas of France.

### Japanese Konoe Cabinet Announces List of Ministers; Yosuke Matsuoka Says Little; Military Newspaper Opposes Flattering Germany and Italy

Tokyo – The list of ministers for the Japanese Konoe Cabinet was announced last night: Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo as Minister of the Army, Vice Admiral Zengo Yoshida as Minister of the Navy, Yosuke Matsuoka (former President of the South Manchuria Railway) as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Colonial Affairs, Tsuyoshi Kawada (member of the House of Peers) as Minister of Finance, Shozo Murata (member of the House of Peers) as Minister of Communications and Minister of Railways, Kunihiko Hashida (Principal of Tokyo First Higher School) as Minister of Education, Eiji Yasui (former Minister of Education) as Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Health and Welfare, Akira Kazami (Director of Tokyo Electric Power Plant) as Minister of Justice, and Naoki Hoshino as President of the Planning Board. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Tokyo – The newly appointed Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka of the Konoe Cabinet, when addressing the press, stated that governance does not require excessive talk, and he will substitute actions for words, refraining from verbose discussions. He believes that most diplomats or politicians who engage in lengthy speeches often fabricate lies or intend to create empty threats. (Havas, 21st)

Tokyo –健治 Tomita Kenji, the governor of Nagano Prefecture, has been internally designated as the chief cabinet secretary for the Japanese Cabinet; Kazue Kobayashi, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, and Tadatsugu Ishiguro, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, will arrive in Tokyo tomorrow or the day after. Konoe plans to hold a ceremony for the appointment of cabinet members on the 22nd, and present the list of cabinet members to the Imperial Palace at the end of the month, where the Emperor will hold the appointment ceremony. (22nd)

Tokyo – The military organ newspaper "国民新聞" (Kokumin Shimbun) recently published an editorial warning about the diplomatic policies that the Konoe Cabinet might pursue. It stated: "If the power of Britain and France in the Far East is eliminated, it would be unwise for us to allow the powers of Germany and Italy to replace them. Japan's diplomatic policy should not be solely aimed at flattering Germany and Italy but should deal with each country on an equal footing. Moreover, the outcome of the war between Britain and Germany is uncertain, and the manner in which Germany will compete with the Soviet Union in diplomacy is also unknown. If Japan only follows the lead of Germany and Italy's policies toward the Soviet Union, it would be detrimental to its own ideals and mission. Furthermore, Japanese newspaper correspondents stationed in Berlin have reported that although various circles in Germany have expressed welcome at the beginning of the Konoe Cabinet, if the policies implemented by the Konoe Cabinet disappoint the Germans in the future, it may cause different reactions, which cannot be predicted.

日日新聞 (Nichinichi Shimbun) reported that certain German sources have issued a warning, stating that if Japan's attitude remains hesitant, it will lose the friendship of Germany and Italy, and Japan will be isolated and helpless." (Havas, 21st)

### Davis Announces New American Invention; Can Mix Rubber and Steel; Create New Decking for Aircraft and Warships

Detroit, USA – Davis, the chairman of the American Rubber Company, recently announced that the decks of aircraft, warships, and tanks, traditionally made of pure steel, can now be made from a new type of decking that combines rubber and steel. After three years of trials, the company has successfully mixed rubber and steel to create a material that is stronger than pure steel and weighs 10% less. This invention is vital to the future of American rearmament because it reduces the weight of aircraft, warships, and tanks, allowing for increased military equipment. If the military equipment is not increased, the speed of aircraft, warships, and tanks can be improved. The construction of the new decking cannot be disclosed at this time. However, according to tests at the factory, the decking can withstand any caliber of cannon fire from close range to 200 yards. (Havas, 21st)

### Hitler Awaits Churchill's Reply; Pope Seeks Armistice Between Britain, Germany, and Italy; Britain to Reject All Mediation

Berlin – Germany remained still yesterday, awaiting Britain's response to Führer Hitler's appeal and postponing the blitz attack on the British Isles. A senior German official warned the British, "Do not think that by not responding to Führer Hitler's speech, you can prolong the time of the German offensive. Hitler will only wait for a time he deems appropriate, not a day longer." Officials here do not acknowledge the reaction to Hitler's speech broadcast by the British newspapers and radio stations as Britain's rejection of Führer Hitler's "peace proposal." German sources indicate that British Prime Minister Churchill will address the British House of Commons tomorrow, and Germany hopes that Churchill will use this opportunity to respond to Hitler's speech. Neutral observers believe that Führer Hitler may postpone the attack on Britain until after Churchill delivers his speech. If Churchill formally rejects Hitler's speech, Germany will take swift action. (United Press, 22nd)

Vatican City – Pope Pius XII held a lengthy discussion with the Italian Ambassador to the Holy See, Attolico, yesterday.

There are conflicting reports about whether the Pope will meet with the German and British ambassadors. (International, 22nd)

The Times of London on the Future of the War

London – The diplomatic correspondent of The Times predicted that Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech tonight would be in response to Hitler's speech. The Foreign Secretary's speech will reject all mediation, as today's struggle is between a free society and a concentration camp, between Christian hope and openly glorifying heresy, which does not allow for any mediation. Therefore, his remarks will be less about military reasons and more about significant moral arguments. A month before Hitler's speech, when France was in its worst condition, Britain had already given a clear response on June 18. On that day, Prime Minister Churchill explained the unwavering determination of Britain to continue the war, based on solid reasons. Churchill said, "The joint admonition of the specialized advisors of the two military branches advised us to continue the war, and Britain has a good and reasonable hope of ultimate victory." When the three military branches issued this opinion, many things were uncertain. Could the British regiments return from France? Could they and other regiments be quickly re-equipped? Would the German offensive erupt as early as Berlin predicted? All of these were uncertain. Afterwards, these questions were answered in favor of Britain. The solid work that has been implemented for national defense and the Royal Air Force in recent months has shown its effectiveness in the recent widespread air raids. Now Britain can not only defend itself but also launch attacks. Hitler probably hesitated and waited until he recognized that his preparations were complete before launching an attack. However, the delay in Hitler's attack on Britain is not only beneficial to the German army. The calm and confident opinion of the British military leaders a month ago has no reason to change, nor is there any trend toward any change. Germany's resources are neither as abundant as Hitler said nor as scarce as many people imagine. When the war broke out, Germany's reserves were abundant, and it has also gained greatly during the war. Its conquest of France has secured enough rubber supply to last for many months, and the iron needed by German industry can now be obtained entirely from France, Norway, and Sweden. Germany has a large reserve of gasoline, and the output of gasoline extracted from brown coal is also gradually increasing, but Germany's total gasoline supply is still insufficient to meet its wartime needs. Furthermore, Germany lacks many ferrous alloys and tin, and will soon feel the shortage of copper. The food situation is now even worse. Other items such as cotton, hemp, and wool are now scarce. The correspondent concluded, "The various news reaching London can be summarized as follows: Germany's war machine is currently being expanded at an enormous cost, which is unbearable for the civilians." The Times also published an editorial stating, "Hitler's speech may be a prelude to a long-term postponement of the attack on Britain. Hitler may settle for a war of attrition, but this seems unlikely. However, no matter which path Hitler takes, we are prepared to deal with it. The air offensive is now in the hands of our fighters and bombers, who will maintain this offensive, regardless of what counterattacks they encounter, while the German army prepares to invade us, and our sovereignty at sea remains unmatched." (Reuters, 22nd)

Italian Journalist Gayda Appeals to America

Rome – Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, yesterday appealed to President Roosevelt and the United States, asking them to have a fuller understanding of the events and intentions of Germany and Italy. Gayda wrote in "The Voice of Italy" that President Roosevelt's prejudice against the Italo-German axis has prevented him from seeing the truth of the European events. Gayda questioned why the President can do everything possible to help the people of other countries but does not pay attention to the needs of 130 million Italian and German people. He said, "We have no dispute with President Roosevelt, we only believe that his remarks are the result of his hatred of Fascism and Nazism. We ask, what benefit does the United States have in continuing this kind of action that is not conducive to the progress of civilizations in history?" Gayda also solemnly stated that both the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States have declared political programs intended to avoid involvement in the European war as much as possible. He said that "this trend will clarify the situation." Observers believe that Gayda indirectly advised President Roosevelt not to make empty promises to Britain, giving the mistaken hope that the United States might intervene in the European war, causing Britain to refuse to consider Hitler's recent peace proposals. (United Press, 22nd)

Churchill Concerned About the Situation in Ireland

Stockholm – According to "Nye Dagligt Allehanda," a London dispatch states that British Prime Minister Churchill is planning to hold a meeting with Irish Taoiseach de Valera and Northern Irish Lord Craigavon to discuss the defense of Ireland.

Rumor that Lloyd George is Fighting for Peace

Stockholm – Swedish newspapers this morning carried a dispatch from London stating that Lloyd George is currently fighting for peace and has gained the support of more than forty members of Parliament.

Turkish Newspapers Criticize Hitler's Speech

Berlin – After Hitler delivered his speech, Turkish newspapers said that Hitler's speech was close to a request for peace. Only a few days after Churchill's speech, Hitler asked to be friendly with Britain, which was an exposure of weakness. German newspapers responded and said that the managers of the Turkish newspapers that published these remarks were receiving subsidies from Britain and were simple-minded, which led them to make this paradox. (Haitong, 22nd)

Mussolini and Hitler Exchange Telegrams

London – German radio stated that Mussolini recently telegraphed Hitler as follows: "Your great speech in Parliament has deeply touched the hearts of the Italian people. I thank you again and assure you that the Italian people will advance shoulder to shoulder with the German people in all situations to achieve victory." Hitler responded, "I am grateful for your friendly telegram. The ideas and forces of Fascist Italy and National Socialist Germany, united as one, will bring the war to a victorious end and guarantee the freedom of our peoples." (Reuters, 22nd)

### To Eliminate Political Assassinations: Consular Body Schedules Discussion, Meeting Scheduled for 3:30 PM on the 25th, Authorities to be Authorized to Adopt Special Measures

Regarding the recent letter from the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council requesting cooperation in suppressing various acts of political assassination and terrorism within the Settlement, the Consular Body is scheduled to hold a meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Council next Thursday (the 25th of this month) at 3:30 PM, chaired by Mr. Hill, the Danish Consul General and senior Consul. A reporter from the English-language "North China Daily News" visited Consul Hill yesterday morning to inquire about the details. According to Mr. Hill, the Consular Body's next steps in response to the request of the Chairman of the Municipal Council could not yet be announced. However, according to information obtained from other sources, the Consular Body will grant the Municipal Council special powers to implement special measures, including advancing the evening curfew and establishing various barriers to cut off traffic on small roads, etc. An official also announced yesterday morning that the Consular Body will also request the authorities of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai to jointly participate in the prevention and control work of the police authorities. It is reported that the authorities of the defense forces of various countries have decided to do their best to assist, so that their work can be more effective. The Consular Body was originally scheduled to hold a meeting yesterday afternoon, but the meeting was postponed because the Japanese Consul General, Mr. Miura Yoshiaki, claimed that he had received the notification too late and that he had another appointment yesterday afternoon that he could not attend, so the meeting was canceled. It is noted that the letter from the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Keswick, to the Consular Body was submitted to the Danish Consul General, Mr. Hill, on the evening of the 20th. After receiving the letter, Mr. Hill considered the matter to be extremely important and immediately notified the other consuls to convene a meeting, but the meeting was eventually postponed.

Japanese Spokesperson Offers Different Opinion

A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at a press conference last night that the Japanese authorities believe that the Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Keswick's request to the senior Consul in Shanghai to convene a meeting of the Consular Body to study ways to curb political terrorism is procedurally incorrect. The spokesperson stated that, firstly, the letter should not have been made public before it had been read by the consuls of the countries involved. Secondly, the letter concerns the issue of maintaining peace and order in Shanghai. This issue should have been discussed with the directors of the Municipal Council before the letter was written and published. Thirdly, the Consular Body is the ruling organization of the Municipal Council, so the Municipal Council is a subordinate body of the Consular Body. Now that Mr. Keswick has asked the Consular Body to convene a meeting, although the Consular Body is willing to cooperate, this procedure is "upside down" and seems to be a case of "holding the handle of the sword upside down." The Japanese authorities agree to maintain law and order and suppress terrorism, but the fundamental issue is the cause of these terrorist acts. There are many causes, but the most important is that those responsible in Shanghai cannot cope with the various realities of the current situation. The spokesperson continued to say that the Chongqing government is no longer able to exercise its power in Shanghai, and that the real power is exercised by the Japanese authorities and the Nanjing "regime." Most terrorist acts are caused by a lack of recognition of this fact, such as the unresolved issue of the First Special District Court due to a lack of realistic understanding.

Planning Effective Suppression Measures

Yesterday, it was believed by well-informed sources that at the special meeting of the Consular Body to be convened on Thursday at the request of the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Keswick, various measures to curb terrorist activities will be approved. The main measures are to strengthen the curfew and to erect barriers between the International Settlement and the notorious badlands. The special meeting was originally scheduled to be convened yesterday, but was postponed to Thursday (the 25th) because the Japanese Consul General, Mr. Miura, claimed that the notification was too short and that he could not attend. A reporter inquired with the senior Consul, Mr. Hill, yesterday about everything. He said that he could not disclose the emergency measures that the Consular Body intends to discuss at the meeting on Thursday. However, according to another reliable source, the Consular Body may grant the Municipal Council special powers, including advancing the curfew time and adding barriers at the border between the International Settlement and the badlands, and that the foreign defense forces stationed in Shanghai will assist the Municipal Council so that the Municipal Council can implement work on a larger scale.

### Japanese Side Investigates Assault on American Reporter

A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at a press conference last night that the Japanese consular police are doing their best to investigate the two thugs who assaulted American reporter Mr. Abben in the Broadway Mansions. The spokesperson confirmed that the Japanese Consul General had received the protest raised by the American Consul General on July 20, but the reply has not yet been sent.

### Batch of Ashes of Japanese Soldiers to be Shipped Home Today

This is the 44th time that Japan has shipped back to its country the ashes of soldiers killed in action in China.

### Hurricane Suddenly Changes Direction, Edge of Storm Touched Shanghai Yesterday, Customs House Raised Ball Warning Yesterday Afternoon, Shanghai Weather Disrupted by Wind

The Pacific hurricane has begun to advance on Shanghai, and the city has been affected by the edge of the storm. The Jianghai Customs House has raised a black ball warning. According to the Xujiahui Observatory's report at 6:00 AM yesterday, the hurricane had advanced to 27 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude. The center of the storm was within 60 nautical miles, moving rapidly in a due north direction. According to the reported position, the hurricane had advanced to the sea southeast of Fuzhou, only 180 nautical miles away, and the storm was fierce.

It is also reported that although the Pacific hurricane has touched Shanghai, its main force passed through the waters east of the Zhoushan Islands, outside the Wusongkou, and has a tendency to move towards Qingdao and Yantai. It is expected that the hurricane will pass over Shanghai before 10:00 AM this morning.

Wind Direction Reverses

The Jianghai Customs House received a report from the Observatory in the afternoon, stating that the hurricane had now advanced to 28 and a half degrees north latitude and 123 and a half degrees east longitude. The wind direction changed from due north to north-northwest. The center of the storm was within 60 nautical miles, advancing towards the city, only 240 nautical miles from Shanghai. The Customs House then, at 2:30 PM yesterday (Customs House time),

Raised Ball Warning

Hoisted a black ball high on the flagpole on the roof of the clock tower, and placed a red light at night to warn ships on the Huangpu River to prevent hurricane attacks. Shipping in and out has been affected.

Ships Sheltering from the Wind

It is reported that the German firm Luhring's "Fei Yuan" vessel and the Italian firm Yi Hua's "Bao Li" vessel, which were scheduled to return to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday, had not been seen entering the port by night, presumably sheltering from the wind.

Outpost Disturbance

Since yesterday morning, the city has been disturbed by the hurricane's outpost. Clouds rose and leaped, and heavy rain fell from time to time. The air pressure was even lower in the afternoon, the sky was dim, and whirlwinds mixed with the rain. Recently, the Huangpu River happened to have high tides, and it is feared that it will coincide with the hurricane, resulting in water damage.

### French Municipal Council Forms Committee to Control Sublet Housing, Eradicating Exploitation of Subtenants, Ending Direct Subletting by Second Landlords

The "China Press" reported that the French Concession Municipal Council recently formed a committee to investigate rents and leasing issues within the Concession.

According to Mr. Goguel, Chairman of the Committee and Legal Counsel to the French Municipal Council,

Controlling Subletting

Requires the establishment of an agency between second landlords and subtenants. All subletting of surplus houses will be handled by the agency.

When the committee's plan is implemented, it will make direct subletting by private parties

Come to an End

### Resumption of Navigation to Wenzhou and Quanzhou Stalled, Yongfeng Suspends Departure, No Telegram from Shenfu Vessel

Since the Japanese side, under the pretext of military needs, prohibited foreign ships from navigating to various ports along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, all routes have been suspended. Foreign ships were preparing to resume navigation to the ports of Quanzhou in Fujian and Wenzhou in Zhejiang. However, due to the intense fighting currently underway in Zhenhai and the concentration of Japanese warships along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, the ships that were to resume navigation have suspended departure again. Except for a few ships that have resumed navigation to the port of Songmen in eastern Zhejiang, all others are stalled. According to the reporter of "Xin Sheng She,"

Quanzhou Route

In addition to the Yilong Company's "Shen Shen" vessel, which resumed navigation from Shanghai to Quanzhou on the 19th of this month, the other two vessels of the Fusheng Company, the "Yongfeng" and "Xin An," were originally intended to follow suit, but have been repeatedly postponed due to the tense situation in Zhejiang and Fujian recently. As of yesterday, the two vessels were still moored in Yangshupu, and it is not known whether the Qiachang Company's "Shenfu" vessel has arrived in Quanzhou, and no telegram has been received. As for

Wenzhou Navigation

However, it is reported that the "Dasheng" vessel is scheduled to test sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou the day after tomorrow. It is not yet known whether the Customs will approve the test sailing.

### Customs Gold Unit to Remain Unchanged, Bank of China Continues to Publish Exchange Rates as Usual, Customs Gold Bonds Have Full Reserves

Chinese currency has always been based on silver. The valuation and taxation of import and export goods at the Customs have always been calculated in Customs Taels. Since the end of 1929, the world's gold-silver parity has undergone drastic changes. The price of gold has soared and the price of silver has plummeted. Foreign exchange rates have become increasingly expensive. The loss from using cheap silver to pay for expensive gold expenditures internationally is self-evident. Moreover, the amount of foreign debt and reparations that China has incurred over the years is very large, and all principal and interest payments must be paid in gold coins converted from silver coins. Because the difference between the gold-silver parity has increased day by day, the payment of a large amount of silver coins is only enough to offset a small amount of gold coin debts. Therefore, China's finances are bound to feel increasingly unbearable. In order to remedy this, the "Customs Gold Unit" was implemented on February 1, 1930, as suggested by American monetary system expert Kemmerer, and gold coins were first collected for import duties. From May 1, 1931, export duties were also changed to be collected under this system. Since then, the Central Bank has published the exchange rate of the "Customs Gold Unit" daily. For example, the listed price on Saturday was two yuan, seven jiao, zero fen, seven li. As for the Customs Gold Exchange Notes and reserves issued by the Central Bank, as of December 31, 1937, the amount issued was 40,963,070, which was fully reserved in cash. The "Customs Gold Unit" system is uniformly followed by all Customs offices across the country and cannot be changed without authorization by the Customs offices in the occupied areas. It is reported that the Inspector General of Customs has denied the statement of changing the "Customs Gold Unit" system. Moreover, the system is very good and has been very smooth since its implementation.

### Silk Transit Duty at 7.5%, Customs Reassesses Value, Effective Yesterday

A 7.5% transit duty will be levied on every ton (100 kilograms) of real silk, artificial silk fabrics, and silk, with the highest value assessed by the Jianghai Customs.

However, all the existing coal dust is said to be controlled by the major coal companies, so the market price of coal dust is still fixed. The Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association held its 38th joint meeting of factory representatives yesterday afternoon to discuss (1) whether to continue to handle the eighth phase of the flat-price coal briquette case, (2) to ask for a joint discussion on the standard market price of coal briquettes.

All Condolence Money Transferred to Polish侨

The Shanghai United Youth Society's Charity Committee, recognizing the bravery and subsequent death of Polish resident Mr. Krasnoff, who was injured while valiantly pursuing the murderer, and his impoverished circumstances, accepted Mrs. Zhang's suggestion to transfer all of Mr. Zhang's condolence money to Mr. Krasnoff's family to console his spirit. All condolence money will still be collected by the funeral committee and handed over to the Shanghai United Youth Society, who will then transfer it to Mrs. Krasnoff. Mr. Krasnoff's courageous act has been widely praised, so all sectors of society should have no objection to transferring Mr. Zhang's condolence money to Mr. Krasnoff's family. Furthermore, the American Asiatic Life Insurance Company will close for half a day this morning to express their condolences.

### The Murder Suspect in the Tram Inspector Case Confesses to the Crime; Other Defendants Give Evasive Answers; Family of the Deceased Demands Compensation of 5,000 Yuan

Chen Guohua, Inspector No. 5 of the French Tram Company, was performing his duties on bus No. 849 of Route 21 on the afternoon of the 25th of last month. When the bus reached the gate of No. 181 Avenue du Pere Robert, he was suddenly shot and killed by Lu Rusheng. The murderer fled to Route Molliere and was arrested by Russian police who shot him in the waist. Based on Lu's confession, the mastermind Wu Senxiang (also known as Wu Laosan), Bian Jintang, Lü Dianchun, and suspects Xu Renchang, Zheng Yuntian, Lu Zhifa, Yuan Jinshan, Wan Shi'an, Wang Yaozhong, Lü Dianshu, Li Rongwen, Lü Anrong, Kuai Da'ao, Hu Tongyao, Xu Baomin, Yao Yulong, Wang Hongchang, Kong Wanxiang, Zhang Qingsheng, Sun Shaoyi, Chen Hongtao, Hu Wandong, Yan Pu, Luo Siwen, Zheng Bingliang, Gu Yuewen, Zhang Wanshi, Yao Debiao, and Xu Yongqing, a total of 30 people, were also arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. Except for Xu Renchang (a detective), who was found to have no connection to the case by the police and was released, the other defendants were prosecuted for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. The court hearing was postponed for further investigation. These details were reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the hearing continued. According to Lu Rusheng's confession, "Wu Senxiang is a friend of mine. Through Wu's introduction, I met Bian Jintang. In August last year, the deceased filed a report stating that Bian Jintang was not working effectively, which led to him being fired by the company."

Dismissed from Business

"His family of several had no food or clothing, so they asked me to kill Chen Guohua. On the 23rd of last month, Bian first took me to the Bund to identify the deceased. On the 24th, a fugitive named Wang Ziming gave me a gun at Bian's house. On the 25th, I, Wu, and Bian got on the bus on Songshan Road and followed the deceased to the Bund, but I couldn't do it because there were too many people. We returned and followed him to the last stop of Jinshenfu Road and Dapuqiao, but it was still inconvenient. Later, we followed him to the intersection of Jinshenfu Road and Avenue des Soeurs, where I finally had the

Opportunity to Strike

According to Wu Senxiang's confession, "Lu Hesheng shot and killed Chen at that time. Bian and I were lookouts. I only heard two gunshots, and I don't know anything else." Bian Jintang confessed, "In August last year, I was dismissed from my business by the company due to the deceased's report. Suddenly, my life was in a panic. The gun used by the murderer was not given by me to Lu Rusheng. It was given by the fugitive Wang Ziming. As for collecting five yuan from each ticket seller to hire a murderer, I know nothing about it. I also did not participate in the discussion at the Daji Inn, Room 213, Liyuanfang, Kangdi Road. However, when Chen Guohua was shot, I

Was Also on the Bus

Lü Dianchun said, "I have no grievances with the deceased, nor did I initiate the collection of five yuan from each ticket seller. The list of names found on my body was entirely because there was a famine in my hometown of Jiangbei, and I was preparing to hold a small meeting and take the money back to my hometown for relief. As for Lu Rusheng getting 200 yuan and Bian getting 50 yuan, I know nothing about it." When questioned, the other 25 defendants all claimed that they did not participate in the incident, did not know about Lü Dianchun collecting five yuan from each person, and did not pay the money. Finally,

The Mother of the Deceased

Chen Jia, and the wife of the deceased, Wang, brought the two daughters of the deceased, Chen Milu (9 years old) and Mixin (3 years old), to the court to seek justice for the deceased. Wang knelt down and cried, asking for justice. They also hired lawyer Huang Mingmin to file a civil lawsuit, demanding that all defendants be jointly and severally liable for compensating the plaintiffs for damages of 5,000 yuan in national currency. After questioning by Judge Zhang Minsheng, he ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody and await a further hearing on August 5th at 8:00 AM. The defendants' request for bail was denied.

### The Gas Company Labor Strike Intensifies; Gas Supply Disrupted; Gas Supply Suddenly Interrupted at Two Gas Plants; Explosion in the Plant, Technician Seriously Injured

All workers at the old plant of the Greater Shanghai British Gas Company on Yu Qiaqing Road went on strike on the 19th due to unmet demands for improved treatment. Workers at the Yangshupu new plant followed suit and joined the strike the day before yesterday. The company hired White Russians to replace the workers, but due to a lack of work experience, the city's gas supply was disrupted and cut off yesterday. Both labor and management are sticking to their positions, and there has been no rapprochement. Eight workers at the Yangshupu plant were arrested, further exacerbating the tense labor situation. The Greater Shanghai News Agency has recorded the details as follows:

Labor and Management Stand Firm

Since the old plant workers put forward 16 demands on the 19th, which were rejected by the company, the company issued a notice on the 20th, limiting all workers to return to work at the plant by 7:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd), otherwise they would be considered to have resigned and would not be paid. All the workers were enraged. At the same time, the workers at the Yangshupu new plant also went on strike yesterday in support of the old plant. In order to protect the interests of users, the company hired 54 White Russians to rush to the boiler room of the Yangshupu new plant to take over the work. The company set the time for the workers to return to work yesterday at 7:00 AM in the morning. At that time, all the workers stood firm and no one returned to work. The labor unrest is getting worse.

Gas Supply Cut Off at Two Gas Plants

The White Russians sent by the company to work at the Yangshupu new plant lacked work experience and did not know how to burn coal, which led to gas supply disruptions. Yesterday, the company's chief engineer, Mr. Sams, led more than a dozen Western staff to supervise and guide the workers at the new plant all day long. However, at 3:00 PM, the gas supply was suddenly cut off at the new and old garbage bridges. Users all over the city called the company to inquire, and the ringing did not stop until late at night. It was also learned that eight workers at the Yangshupu new plant were arrested yesterday morning. The workers sent representatives to the police station to demand their release, but as of last night, there were no results.

Chinese and Western Detectives on High Alert

Yesterday, dozens of disheveled White Russians gathered in front of the company's office on Yu Qiaqing Road, asking for work. They stood there all day long, waiting for news. The company also hired some White Russians to go to Yangshupu to work. Due to the tense situation, the company's chairman, Mr. Clavert, personally drove a truck to transport the White Russians to the plant. Detectives were dispatched by the police around the company to protect it. Chinese and Western detectives were also densely deployed around the Yangshupu new plant, on high alert. The most affected users in the two concessions were newspapers and public utility factories.

Company Secretary States Five Points

The reporter from the Greater Shanghai News Agency visited the company's secretary, Mr. W.J. Brown, yesterday afternoon and asked the following five questions, which are recorded as follows: (1) Reporter asked, "How is the White Russian working?" Answer, "Everything is very good. Although the supply was suspended for some time yesterday, it was immediately restored, because the White Russians are slower than the Chinese workers. Now because there are not enough White Russians and their skills are not very good, all the engineers in the company have gone to Yangshupu to help." (2) Asked, "What measures will be taken after the gas supply is cut off?" Answer, "We are considering it." (3) Asked, "It is said that the striking workers have put forward sixteen demands. Is this true?" Answer, "Because I (Brown) am a secretary, not an engineer, all matters related to the workers are handled by the Yangshupu plant, so I have not yet learned the details." (4) "Is the impact on the company significant?" Answer: "Absolutely not. We already have White Russians to replace them." (5) "What is the opinion of the company's management?" Answer: "Our opinion has been published in the advertisement column of the English Great China Evening News last night. The gist is that 'the company's management has made the greatest effort to supply gas for the convenience of users, and all sub-offices will be open for business from tomorrow (23rd).'"

Explosion Occurs, Technician Injured

According to the company, an explosion occurred in the plant yesterday morning, causing the company's assistant engineer, Mr. Keniger, to suffer serious head injuries. He was sent to the Country Hospital for treatment. The Public Works Department's police have not yet received a request for assistance. According to the Public Works Department spokesman yesterday, the police do not want to interfere unless there is a violation of the law or a disturbance of order.

Arrest of Workers at the New Plant

At about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the police arrested eight workers at the Yangshupu new plant. According to the workers at the plant, the reason for the arrest was that the new plant had hired temporary Chinese workers to work in the factory since the day before yesterday. The striking workers learned of this and prevented the temporary workers from working at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The company reported this to the police, who arrested them. The workers are now demanding their release.

### Social Miscellany

Wang Afu and Zhao Cun, two men from Jiangbei residing at No. 15 Pingliang Road, were found to be carrying 38,000 old national currency copper coins last night at 8:00 PM, suspected of transporting them to a certain place for illegal profit by melting them down. They were apprehended by Chinese police at the intersection of Haining Road and North Jiangxi Road. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special Court, and a request for their detention was filed according to law. After a brief interrogation by Judge Meng, it was ordered that the hearing be postponed for seven days.

Li Wenbin, a Sichuan native and former soldier in the 88th Division, was wounded in the left arm by a bullet during the Shanghai War. After being treated by a doctor, he worked as a laborer at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf in Shanghai. Recently, he suddenly went blind in both eyes. Feeling that he would not be able to maintain his livelihood in the future, Li had a pessimistic view of life. At about 8:00 PM last night, he took a pair of scissors and slit his abdomen at the wharf. A police officer saw him and called an ambulance to take him to the hospital for treatment. His life is in danger.

### An Unusual Force in the Sports World: Shanghai Star Expands its Organization

The Shanghai Star Women's Basketball and Volleyball Team is managed by Mr. Zhang Shuliang and is responsible for everything by Mr. Liang Yunming, a famous basketball player. Initially, the team only had a women's volleyball organization, which won the Binhai Cup Championship not long ago.

They were invited to participate in a performance match with the Jingwu Women's Basketball Team at the opening of the United Cup, posing a great threat to Jingwu. Mr. Zhang Shuliang, the backbone of the team, recognized the decline of the sports scene in Shanghai, so he specially expanded the organization to form a purely sports association, still using the name Shanghai Star.

The men's volleyball team has registered to join the Binhai Cup Volleyball League, which begins this week, and the men's basketball team is preparing to join the second Guangshi Cup, which will begin soon.

Business News

### Finance: American Businesses Receive Telephone Calls From Home, There Are Rumors That the US Dollar Is Not Allowed To Be Shorted, American Banks Are Instead Absorbing Sterling To Profit Off The Difference, Market Trends Are Showing Signs of Sterling Loosening and the US Dollar Tightening

Yesterday's foreign exchange market showed no significant changes in HSBC's listed prices, as operators were temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. Trading became stable, and the trend showed a state of loosening of sterling and tightening of the US dollar. This was due to rumors that American banks received telephone calls from the US government last Saturday, prohibiting shorting the US dollar. Therefore, American banks frequently absorbed US dollars today, and arbitrage sold sterling. Also, foreign firms needed US dollar positions, so the underlying trend of the US dollar was slightly soft, and sterling became slightly harder. The closing price was the same as the afternoon closing price, with sterling at 3 pence 875 and the US dollar at 6 yuan 125, compared to the closing price last Saturday, sterling was harder by .015625 and the US dollar was tighter by .03125. The futures market lacked consultants, so it was even more stable.

Foreign Firms Also Have Settlements

At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate of sterling against the US dollar remained unchanged, against Shanghai it shrank by .0625, and against France there was no market. The central listed prices for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with sterling at 3 pence 84375 and the US dollar at 6 yuan 15625, compared to last Saturday's closing, the US dollar was flat and sterling was tighter by .015625, which was due to the slight drop in the exchange rate. After the opening, American banks first showed a willingness to supply, and the market was slightly harder. American banks and foreign banks were doing spot sterling at 3 pence 84375 to 875. HSBC's listed price was announced and remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was also announced with no increase or decrease. After this, foreign firms had some settlements, resulting in demand exceeding supply, and the price immediately softened. Foreign firms profited by purchasing spot US dollars from foreign banks at 6 yuan 125. Later, British banks such as Maijiali came to sell, and there were very few buyers, so the market was very quiet. Maijiali sold spot US dollars to American banks, and the price rose again to 6 yuan 15625. Until the close of the market, there was still a lack of change. As a result, sterling was 3 pence 875, the US dollar was 6 yuan 125, August sterling was 3 pence 84375, and August US dollar was 6 yuan 0625, compared to the morning spot price, sterling was longer by .03125, and the US dollar was tighter by .03125. August sterling was flat and the US dollar was also softer by .03125.

Afternoon Trading Not Much

The market remained calm in the afternoon, and not much trading took place. Chinese banks sold this month's US dollars to foreign banks at an average price of 6 yuan 15625. Sterling was not heard of being transacted. The closing price in the evening was exactly the same as the afternoon closing price, with sterling at 3 pence 875, the US dollar at 6 yuan 125, August sterling at 3 pence 84375, and August US dollar at 6 yuan 0625. Compared to the end of last week, spot sterling was longer by .015625, the US dollar was tighter by .03125, August sterling was flat, and sterling was also harder by .03125.

Hong Kong US Dollar Unstable

Hong Kong, 22nd (Monday) Telegraph, The exchange market opened flat this morning, but the US dollar is still volatile. The spot prices for British, Japanese, and Shanghai currencies are unchanged. The spot price for the US dollar is tighter by 125, at 23 yuan 75. At 9:55 AM, the spot price for the US dollar continued to tighten by .0625, at 23 yuan 6875. At 11:30 AM, the market was flat, and all currencies showed no gains or losses. Extending to 2:30 PM, the market remained at its original level, with no ups or downs.

Tianjin Exchange Rate Tightens

Tianjin, 22nd (Monday) Telegraph, The exchange market opened sluggish this morning. The spot prices for British and US currencies were each tighter by .03125, with the British currency at 3 pence 59375 and the US currency at 5 yuan 75. The Shanghai currency remained unchanged, remaining at 107 yuan 2 jiao and a half. The "Joint Note" dark market was slightly cheaper by 1 jiao and a half, at 93 yuan 6 jiao and a half.

### Short Selling Resurges: Gold Market Declines

Yesterday's cash cooked gold dark market situation could not rise, because people lacked interest in buying. Short sellers were seen, even though the exchange market's US dollar was tightening. After entering the 5,300 yuan range, the gold price was difficult to break through. In the early morning, it was 5,300 yuan, down 45 yuan from last Saturday. Later, silver shops slightly absorbed, raising it by 20 yuan. However, the money exchange industry suddenly massively shorted, immediately falling to 280 yuan. Although silver shops and retail investors had recovered, the afternoon closing price was only 5,290 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon with silver shops selling at a low of 5,275 yuan, relying on securities firms to maintain it, improving by more than ten yuan. However, the need was ultimately low, and the evening closing price was only 5,285 yuan, resulting in a drop of 60 yuan. There was not much trading throughout the day, only about 2,000 taels. Silver shops eventually listed gold ornaments at a small ten yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Cooked Gold Fell Sixty Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels) initially weakened due to the loosening of the exchange market and slight public frustration. The market opened by pressing down 45 yuan. Silver shops did ten taels for 5,300 yuan. Then, relying on a certain silver shop and cash shop to absorb, it once rebounded by 20 yuan. Silver shops and peers entered dozens of taels for 5,320 yuan. After this, due to a certain money exchange industry throwing out some quantity, it fell by 40 yuan again. The money exchange industry sold ten taels to silver shops, losing 5,280 yuan. Then, a certain money exchange industry stopped throwing out and came back to enter a small number, and at that time, the public sentiment was still good, and there were many who took advantage of the low price to enter and do more, rising again by 30 yuan. The money exchange industry entered 50 taels to silver shops for 5,310 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, the number of buyers decreased, and scattered dealers saw the scene and ended, so it fell again by 20 yuan. Silver shops sold 20 taels to gold shops for 5,290 yuan. Later, gold shops sold ten taels to silver shops and peers, all for 5,285 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 60 yuan compared to the end of last week. The post-closing market trend was still strong, five yuan higher than the closing price, and there were no sellers. There were ups and downs of 45 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was tens of yuan higher than the cooked gold, and the reduction was reduced by 30 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and they were not opened.

Ornamental Gold Listed at a Small Ten Yuan

At the beginning, the selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael was still 550 yuan for Datong Bank. By noon, it was reduced by ten yuan. After that, there was no change. Datong Bank changed to 540 yuan. The new colleagues were similar to the above price, and the collection was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### The Past Week's Exchange Market: Observations on the Future of Foreign Exchange

According to the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute, last week's market fluctuated very little. The highest US dollar was 6 yuan 25, and the lowest was 5 yuan 84375. The highest British currency was 3 pence 9375, and the lowest was 3 pence 84375.

Although there was some ups and downs due to rumors of the abolition of free sterling, the stimulus was minimal. Since the expansion of the European affairs, international payments have mostly been settled in US dollars. Even if the sterling-US dollar exchange rate rises to the legal price of 4 yuan and 02 cents, the local exchange market may not be related to it. Examining the other fluctuating factors last week, according to market rumors, there are still the following points:

(1) International routes are blocked,

(2) Military operations are intensifying.

(3) Peace rumors are floating,

(4) The southward advance is gradually becoming active.

According to the recent market trends and its response to various news, it seems different from usual. Last year, when the US dollar grew from the 6 yuan mark to more than 9 yuan, the growth rate was more than 50%, but it immediately turned to shrink without hesitation. This time, it grew from 4 yuan 685 to more than 6 yuan, and the growth rate was also no less than 50%. For two months, it is still circling, and the market's response to various news is also very flat. For example, the blocking of international routes and the intensification of military operations are all enough to make foreign exchange tight, but in reality, nothing has happened. Furthermore, the peace news has been denied, but it has not softened the exchange market, which shows that the footing is firm, and the nation's belief in the legal currency is becoming more stable.

According to reports, with Konoe's rise to power, the southward advance policy will be carried out as soon as the opportunity arises. Once it becomes a reality, the military power of that country will inevitably be concentrated on the new target, then China's war situation may change, and the line of sight will shift, and the local situation may turn to stability. As the world war expands, the possibility of the United States being involved in the whirlpool is increasing. Then, the funds to escape will inevitably return, and the deposits of foreign banks in China will also have a subtle effect, inevitably throwing out foreign exchange in order to cope with it. At the same time, with the outbreak of the war, the legal currency's foreign exchange target is becoming more dangerous, and with the obstruction of transportation, the actual need is reduced, then the nation's interest in foreign exchange is becoming weaker. The banks in this port, which are known for arbitrage, have seen a decrease in activity in recent days. If the southward advance is active, the United States may further implement an embargo, then the need for legal currency will increase to purchase China's raw materials, then the so-called southward advance may have a constructive effect on the exchange market.

### Foreign Currency Weakens Again

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw cooked gold fall again. British and American gold pounds also fell by one and a half yuan each. The supply and demand of British gold notes was balanced, and the market price remained flat. The American gold notes were still circling in a narrow range and eventually fell by seven cents. Canadian notes were very soft. The demand for Japanese gold notes was very high, and the market price rose again. The evening market was one yuan two jiao one and a half cents. The demand for Korean notes was surprisingly high, and the evening market was as high as one yuan zero five and a half cents. There was also no shortage of demand for Hong Kong notes, and the market price rose by two cents.

### Grains: Soybean Prices Do Not Loosen Due To Transportation Issues

The transaction of beans in miscellaneous grains is extremely narrow. The brokers in the market only ask for prices, but there is no actual transaction. The movement of dozens of bags in this street depends on the city's weakness. However, due to the difficulty in transporting and the high cost, most cargo owners are unwilling to sell cheaply, so the trend is still not repairing. At present, various high-quality cargo plates are in a plain situation, while medium and secondary goods are still falling. Yesterday, only 200 bags of Qingdao soybeans were transacted, the price is detailed in the market price bar, 50 bags of Xiashi soybeans, 150 bags of Pudong broad beans, 50 bags of Zhangyan broad beans, 50 bags of Beigang green-skinned broad beans, more than 100 bags of Minhang Nangang green-skinned broad beans, more than 50 bags of Liuhe broad beans, 100 bags of Wuhu small-grain white-skinned broad beans, and only 170 bags of Mingguang mung beans.

### Food: Common Japonica Touches the Seventy Yuan Mark Again, 150,000 Bags Arrived Yesterday, Foreign Rice Is Still Insisting on Not Releasing

The rice market opened for the first time yesterday after the holiday. Customers and merchants on this street had to wait for a long time for transportation passports, and it was difficult to wait for a long time. Customers and merchants took advantage of the instability of the Zhejiang and Fujian sea frontiers and firmly refused to release the goods. The city presented a situation of less output and more input, and the situation was agitated, and the rising wind continued. As a result, each price rose step by step in the shouting, increasing by one yuan compared to the previous week. The closing price of No. 1 Chen Saigon was 56 yuan and a half, Xin Jian 56 yuan, No. 2 53 yuan and a half, 53 yuan, Chen 54 yuan, No. 1 Siam 56 yuan and a half, 56 yuan, No. 2 53 yuan, Huojiao 56 yuan, 55 yuan and 7 jiao, Hong Kong Jian 55 yuan, 54 yuan and a half, No. 2 53 yuan 8 jiao, Tokyo broken Jian was high from 50 yuan, followed by 47 yuan, broken Jian 43 yuan and a half, followed by 41 yuan and a half, rice mung 45 yuan and a half, 45 yuan.

In terms of road goods, the cargo owners also thought that it was difficult to draw a line for the future and that there was a risk of shipping, so they were unwilling to sell the stored rice cheaply. In addition to the new batches of road goods being received and paid for by the Shantou gang, the cargo side also directly allocated them to the local customers. Therefore, the cargo side regarded the loading of the Nianhao in the last month as the delivery of the goods and the loading of the 26th in the last month as a rare commodity. Because the floating goods on the market have been exhausted, the customers and merchants welcome them because they are fresh. The opening price of the 26th loading was still 61 yuan 2 jiao, only 2 jiao higher than last Saturday. It then reached 63 yuan from 61 yuan and a half to 62 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than last week. The opening price of the 20th loading for immediate delivery jumped up by 2 yuan to 62 yuan, and then increased by 3 jiao to 62 yuan 3 jiao, which was 2 yuan 3 jiao higher. The current rice has also risen from 1 yuan to 2 yuan. The total transaction of current rice was about 8,900 bags, and the recycled original bags were more than 500 tons.

A total of 1,340 bags of japonica and glutinous domestic rice arrived, of which japonica rice accounted for the majority. It is rumored that the transaction in the dark market is also active because foreign rice continues to be expensive. Therefore, the selling price of japonica rice has been raised, and the price of fresh special Qing japonica has reached the 70 yuan mark. Special Qing japonica is 68.9 yuan, Wuxi Qing japonica is 68 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun japonica is high from 67.8 yuan, followed by Suxu 62.3 yuan, Qingsi Bo rice is 68 yuan, Nangang Hu early is 61 yuan, and the road for glutinous rice is slightly worse, with only half a yuan added. Liyang special yuan is 64 yuan and a half, Jintan special yuan is 64 yuan, 63 yuan and a half, Changdan Baiyuan is 62.3 yuan, and Hong Kong glutinous rice is 61 yuan.

Foreign rice has also arrived in Shanghai. The other day, Yihe Foreign Company Taisheng transported 2,095 bags from Haiphong and 12,942 bags from Hong Kong, for a total of 15,037 bags. The arrival in Shanghai coincided with Sunday and began unloading yesterday morning.

### Wheat Cargo Owners Want to Get Compensation From Chinese Factories, But Are Also Suffering From Not Being Able to Fly Over, Miscellaneous Brands of Flour Are Flooding the Market

Flour was the beginning of the week yesterday, and the transaction of current flour continued to be quiet. The Japanese factory flour and domestic miscellaneous brand flour are flooding the market, which has reduced the sales of Chinese flour. The factory is also not accommodating because of the difficulty in purchasing raw materials. The price of the No. 2 flour factory is still 16 yuan. Most of the customers on this street think it is expensive. The two factories have only issued 3,400 bags. Other various miscellaneous flours are all fighting each other. There are many dark sales with customers. It is heard that the Phoenix brand only opens at 14 yuan 7,8 jiao, and the Jinshan brand is 15 yuan 6,7 jiao, but they are all in the sound of rejection.

The wheat market was still dim yesterday. The new arrivals in Hongkou, in addition to a few being distributed to Japanese factories, the general cargo owners wanted to sell at a good price to Chinese factories, but they were unable to transport them into the concession. The foreign wheat that Chinese factories negotiated to order has not been agreed due to transportation and ship location issues, so the market has become more silent.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Slightly Improves

The securities dark market slightly strengthened yesterday after four days of small trading, and trading gradually decreased. The lively scene on the 16th has become a past. However, it cannot be concluded that there is no hope. A few days of small decline is just the aftereffect of a big rise. There are currently a lot of mixed messages, which cannot be investigated. Speculators are also taking the opportunity to wait and see, but it is still not valued by all parties. However, it is still brewing, which is an indisputable fact. The issue of principal and interest has been determined to be no problem after a period of rumors. There are people buying interest coupons at 95% discount, and there should still be a dawn in the future. Yesterday's situation showed that the positions of both the bulls and the bears were in a state of no chaos, and they were still the same as before. The result of the competition between the bulls and the bears in the two markets was that the market situation turned from low to high. As a result, each debt slightly improved by 2 jiao to 3 jiao and a half. The total number of transactions was more than 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Maximum Minimum Closing Compared to the Previous Day

Unified A 62.80 62.70 62.75 Up .30

Unified B 53.35 53.20 53.35 Up .35

Unified C 51.80 51.50 51.65 Up .20

Unified D 50.55 50.50 50.55 Up .20

Unified E 51.00 50.90 50.00 Up .0

Stock trading, 100 shares of China National Goods Company were transacted, with a price of 26 yuan.

Also, in the stock market of the Public Trade Association yesterday, there was some profit-taking in the morning. In the afternoon, people's hearts suddenly turned prosperous, and industrial stocks and rubber stocks both strengthened at the same time. The shares of the three trust companies soared from low prices, and the rise was strong.

### Yarn Flowers: Double Horse Yarn, Factory Opens 3,600 Bales

The yarn market is stagnant and lacks distinct characteristics. However, industry peers and retail speculators remain reluctant to loosen their grip. Consequently, the market has become a tug-of-war. Actual sales, however, remain sparse and unsatisfactory, resulting in an exceptionally sluggish market, with a desolate atmosphere on the trading floor.

The opening atmosphere in the yarn market this morning was dispersed. Coupled with reports of escalating conflicts in eastern Zhejiang, sellers did not actively promote sales. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at $915, falling to $910. However, despite the initial low price, major players remained inactive, with only smaller entities and scalpers releasing some holdings. Consequently, the market remained relatively stable, hovering around $920 for a considerable time. Nearing 11:00 AM, with no reported changes in foreign exchange rates, and scalpers finding no further profit opportunities, they were forced to cover their positions. As a result, the market gradually rebounded to $929. The closing price saw a slight setback. A midday tally showed 1,570 bales traded, with the market up by $6. Yesterday, 50 bales of cotton yarn arrived from Hong Kong, and today, 70 bales were shipped to Xiamen. The quantities purchased by various trading groups are listed below:

Industry peers: 1,490 bales, Hong Kong: 70 bales

Mainland: 10 bales, Total: 1,570 bales

In the afternoon, news arrived that the Shenxin No. 9 Factory opened with 20 bales, priced at $945, with a deposit of $110 per bale, to be cleared in August and September. It is said that these were all accepted by industry peers.

### Cotton Market Remains Quiet

Current cotton trading shows little development. This is because foreign cotton prices are still declining, and silk sales are sluggish, resulting in a lack of large-scale business. However, with the Shenxin No. 9 Factory having released a large quantity of cotton yarn, there may be a replenishment of raw materials, which has slightly boosted market confidence.

Another report indicates that foreign cotton market prices, particularly in New York, appear weak due to favorable weather conditions in cotton-growing regions and the sale of some spot goods. As a result, closing prices fell by three to four points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market yesterday, including forecasts, fell by six rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has been particularly quiet recently, with all parties adopting a wait-and-see approach. Factory inventories are not abundant, and cotton stocks on the market are also low. Therefore, should market conditions improve slightly, factories will promptly make purchases. Transactions among industry peers have also been remarkably quiet recently.

### Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Supply Cut Off, Most Transactions in Mainland

Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market saw spot prices at $1,350, near-term futures at $1,385, and long-term futures at $1,383. These figures show little change compared to the end of last week. Foreign firms experienced sporadic silk sales, with some accounts from New York. However, mainland silk thread cannot reach Shanghai. Currently, tussah silk thread is fetching $3,400, nearly $1,000 more than prices paid by Japanese merchants purchasing in the mainland. Yesterday, White Factory 81 was offered at $5,150, but the number of bales was limited. The pressure from "controlled" trade is increasing daily. Consequently, the export silk market is likely to come to a standstill, as British and French firms are unable to compete with Japanese merchants. Simultaneously, many silk threads that cannot be shipped are transacted within the mainland. There is a possibility that the center of the silk market may shift. Local silk factories are currently facing a dire situation due to the disruption of transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang, with raw silk materials being completely cut off. Recently, several silk factories have successively suspended operations, and the future appears bleak.

Today, nine bales of silk thread were shipped to Hong Kong, and five bales, along with 200 boxes of tea, were shipped to Singapore.

### Coal: Coal Briquette Black Market Continues to Fall

The coal briquette market has seen heated price competition among industry peers in recent days, leading to further price declines. Following the reduction in prices last weekend, a certain factory launched a major distribution drive yesterday, causing the black market price to fall by another $6, setting the price at $126 per ton, delivered by truck, with additional charges for transportation. Consequently, smaller factories, in order to survive, have followed suit in reducing prices, causing the prices at street-level vendors to become exceptionally chaotic and inconsistent.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Easier

Yesterday, the sugar market remained stable. The guild's price for spot goods was $68.30 for second-grade coarse white sugar produced by local factories, unchanged. Foreign warehouse prices were $68.20, and transshipment goods were $52.65, with 30-day delivery at $53.20, all minor adjustments. Taikoo Refineries' White B mark remained at $78, HX mark at $75, Dutch Red at $58, local factory Snow White at $68.50, No. 1 White at $68, with Nos. 2, 3, and 4 being returned. Local ice sugar showed fluctuations. Domestic sugar still lacks continued openings. Also, 1,700 tons of sugar arrived from the Netherlands yesterday.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Xu-style Vegetables Soon to be Available

According to quick reports from customers, a small quantity of the first batch of new Xuzhou golden daylily buds has already been shipped and is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. This batch is experimental in nature, so the quantity is small. It is reported that there was a poor harvest in the production area, and later batches are unlikely to arrive in large quantities.

### Metals: Canadian Lead Declines

The Canadian lead market has shown a downward trend recently, as local businesses have been experiencing slow sales. Coupled with a lack of confidence in the Shanghai market and sluggish market conditions, prices have declined. Currently, the selling price is around $110 per picul.

Lacquer

The use of lacquer in China has been prevalent since the time of the Five Emperors, and continues to this day. Commentators consider it unmatched in the world. However, few know that the West has even more ingenious methods of producing lacquer. Lacquer powder is available in five colors, all radiant and eye-catching. Few Chinese are aware of this. In the treaty ports, it is used to some extent, but it is difficult to trace its origin.

Hoarding Money is Useless

A man surnamed Weng from Suzhou was known for his meanness and skill in accounting. Throughout his life, he accumulated a vast fortune through usury and exploitation. He had one son who was fond of pleasure. Fearing that his son would squander his wealth, Weng secretly dug a hole under his bed and hid silver inside. One day, Weng awoke to hear rustling sounds from the hole. He opened the brick to investigate and suddenly a weasel jumped out and bit Weng's hand, nearly severing his finger. Weng cried out in pain and collapsed. His son heard the noise and entered the room, seeing the hidden gold. However, Weng's vigilance was so tight that he never left the gold unguarded, leaving no opportunity to seize it. Weng's neighbor, a leather worker, was a known rogue. His son conspired with him, hiding in the leather worker's house for several days. The leather worker then went to Weng and falsely claimed that his son was gambling in some place and had lost a large sum of money. He urged Weng to quickly retrieve him, otherwise there might be trouble. Weng believed him and hired a boat to go there. Meanwhile, the son and the leather worker dug through the wall and stole everything, escaping with the loot. Weng returned home to find that both his money and his son were gone, and he was overwhelmed with grief.

Short Talk

### Wisdom Obscured by Greed

— Editor

Dear Editor:

I now have a difficult problem to ask you to solve on my behalf. I believe you are a mentor to the readers, and I hope you will not refuse my request!

I am a seventeen-year-old unmarried girl who has completed junior high school. My father was a legitimate businessman before the war, and our family's financial situation was not too bad. After fleeing to Shanghai during the war, my father never had a proper job. He did some speculative business and made some money, and suddenly our family's spending became extravagant. My father and mother lived very luxuriously, and my father made friends with a group of high-class loafers, so his thinking was greatly influenced. Recently, his speculation failed, and our finances inevitably suffered a setback. He had the wild idea to force me to become a dancer, hoping to make a fortune from me. This kind of behavior, where wisdom is obscured by greed and basic human nature is extinguished, truly makes me want to cry. For the sake of my own future happiness, I have politely refused and delayed. But my father insists on his own way, disregarding everything. I heard that he has already reached an agreement with the manager of a certain dance hall, and it seems that the day I am forced into a fiery pit is not far off. I have a lover, Mr. So-and-so, who is loyal, honest, young, and handsome, and currently works at a bank in Shanghai with a decent income. My father and mother initially valued him quite a bit. But now, because they have other intentions, they no longer allow me to see him. The day before yesterday, I tried every means to meet with him and told him this unfortunate news. At first, he was shocked, and then he shed tears. I know that he is very willing to help me, but because of various concerns (the biggest reason being that I am underage), he can't think of a proper solution. I now feel that my father's behavior has no paternal love at all, so why should I be foolishly filial and let him slaughter me, sacrificing my bright future? I have now decided that if necessary, I will leave the family and run away alone. I have a few questions, and I respectfully ask for your guidance:

(1) My father is forcing his daughter to engage in a lowly profession. Can I hire a lawyer to negotiate and formally separate from the family?

(2) After I run away, my father will surely suspect that it was my friend's idea, and he may go to negotiate with him, but without evidence, I don't think he will be guilty of anything?

(3) How many charitable organizations in Shanghai provide relief to women? I want to go there for help in an emergency. Is that possible? (Please provide the locations.)

Please answer the above points in "Free Talk" within a few days. I would be endlessly grateful.

Respectfully wishing you

Good health! A weak woman, Wen, July 15th.

After receiving the above letter, we are truly speechless. In a place like Shanghai, there are countless women who are as unfortunate as Ms. Wen, or even a hundred times more unfortunate. In the eyes of some parents, children are simply their personal property, a goose that lays golden eggs, to be raised for wealth. As long as there is a profit to be made, even the children's bodies and souls can be sold off. Such people are not only pitiable but also hateful!

At this time, unconditionally hating such parents is certainly not the solution. Fundamentally, the education they received is a problem, and the social environment certainly has a great influence on them. A person who cannot fight hard against a bad social environment and cannot live a simple material life with perseverance can also be said to be a failure of education. (The education I am referring to includes family education, school education, social education, and self-education.)

Fundamentally, this is of course a social problem, but before the transformation of the entire society is completed, we should do our best to help women who are ambitious and willing to work for a brighter future, and not let them fall into a fiery pit.

For women in Ms. Wen's situation, for the sake of self-defense, we believe that they should strive for independence in life and economics to avoid the suffering of being displaced and homeless when leaving their families. Regarding resisting family oppression, we hope that Ms. Wen will immediately go to the Child Protection Section attached to the Industrial Department of the Public Works Bureau at 209 Jiangxi Road to see the lady in charge. We have already contacted them, and they are very concerned and sympathetic towards oppressed weak women who are unwilling to fall into depravity, and are willing to help as much as possible. We are sorry that we cannot answer the other points one by one.

Sketches

### Ink

— Shu Wen

Staring blankly at the dried-up ink bottle, it feels as if my own lifeblood has also withered away.

I feel a wave of emptiness, infinitely and depressingly surging into my heart.

A month ago, I bought a bottle of Parker ink with great joy. At that time, I had just started a writing project, and everything was pleasant and full of vitality. How delicate and crystalline was that full bottle of blue ink! It symbolized a healthy young man full of fresh vitality, who could move, jump, and be arrogantly invincible. Looking at it, one would inexplicably become excited. I caressed it again and again, lovingly placed it in the paper box, and from then on, I relied on it to write and scribble on sheets of manuscript paper. It followed the tip of my gold pen, obeying my will, twisting left and sweeping right, gradually merging with my lifeblood. When I wrote late into the night and my eyes became blurred, I often vaguely saw the blue handwriting shining with brilliant peach-red light. This light was familiar to me. It was a symbol of my lifeblood, the essence of my spirit that had been pondered and condensed. Ah! How happy I was! Caressing each blue character, as solid and rugged as a relief, and the gradually thickening original manuscript was even more comforting, making me smile. I glanced at the ink bottle, grateful to it, knowing that it would always be full, always vibrant, and always merge with my lifeblood to imprint clear characters.

For three months, my days passed happily like this.

My nerves became more and more tense, and the work felt more and more continuous and late into the night. The ink helped me send one manuscript after another back to the drawer, from one hundred pages to two hundred pages to three hundred pages. Ah, my heart wanted to fly lightly into the sky. I was no longer afraid of the heat, no longer worried about fatigue, only felt that the energy I had accumulated was as abundant as the ink, and I vigorously sent the ink onto the paper...

However, when I finished writing the last word, the ink dried up, the ink ran out.

I was empty, as if the energy that had been tense for three months had suddenly relaxed and withered. I was too weak to move. My heart kept sinking, leaving a boundless wilderness in the middle.

Caressing the original manuscript of 200,000 words, I mournfully mourned the empty ink bottle with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow, and the lovely ink that had been used up on these hundreds of pages of original manuscript.

The Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Dancer's Fate

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 3: Conflicting Information

Hawthorne nodded and said, "Yes, that inference is very interesting—ah, you said you also went to see a play last Sunday night. What was the situation when you came home that time?"

Old Mao said, "That was very different from last night. The play ended after 1:00 AM. When I returned here, the lights were off upstairs and downstairs, and the main door was locked. I opened the door and went back to my room to sleep. Nothing was unusual."

Hawthorne threw away the cigarette butt and said again, "Okay, last night, after you entered the gate, you went back to your guardhouse and didn't come to this living room, did you?"

Old Mao said, "No—sir, you understand that I shouldn't come in."

"Then, after returning to your room, what did you do?"

"I already told you. I took some Po Sum On Medicated Oil, drank a cup of cold tea, and went to sleep immediately. I fell asleep as soon as I lay down."

"So, you didn't know when the guest left?"

"I really don't know. After I fell asleep, I was only awakened by the sound of the gunshot. When I got dressed and put on my shoes and came out, I saw that the main door was still ajar and unlocked. At that time, Old Man Li and Jinmei had also come downstairs. I heard Old Man Li shouting in the living room: 'Who killed her? Who killed her?' Only then did I realize that Miss Wang had had an accident. I walked up the stone steps and saw that the front door was open. I turned on the electric light at the door and found several strange footprints on the floor inside the door. I shouted, and Old Man Li and Jinmei also came out."

"You covered the footprints with wooden boards at that time?"

"Yes, because I already knew that there was a strange guest in the middle of the night, and it was raining, so these footprints on the floor were certainly very important. I went back to my room, took out a few floorboards, and covered the footprints before coming in."

Hawthorne nodded. This nodding action seemed to be contagious, influencing Inspector Ni. I remember that when Ni Jinshou heard Jinmei's report just now, he suspected why Old Mao paid special attention to these footprints. Now, after hearing his explanation, he clearly also thought it was reasonable, so he nodded involuntarily.

Hawthorne asked again, "Tell me more. What happened after that?"

Old Mao said, "We discussed it for a while. Jinmei suggested calling Manager Lu and Miss Jiang to report. Because Miss Jiang is Miss Wang's best friend and often comes and goes here. She also came here yesterday afternoon. When Jinmei was making the call, I accompanied Old Man Li to Miss Wang's room on the second floor to take a look. Nothing was unusual. The bedding on her bed was neatly made, and she hadn't slept in it, as if Miss Wang hadn't gone upstairs after coming back." (53)

Essays

### Life, Death, and Demons

— Zhou Wu

How do we distinguish between life and death?

Doctors say: when people can continue to breathe, they have life; when breathing stops, they are considered dead.

But the life and death that I am about to talk about are different from what doctors say. If a person lives in the world, living without meaning, without any help or benefit to human society, then what is the difference between that and death? Furthermore, if society has an added burden because of him, he is a burden to society, it would be better if he were dead.

There is a saying that everyone is familiar with: "Death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather." In fact, this is also true of "life." Therefore, I give the following solemn definitions to "life" and "death":

Whoever lives and contributes to human society, who is beneficial, can be called "life."

Whoever lives without meaning and without benefit to human society is the same as when breathing stops, and is called "death."

Those who live and harm human society are neither "life" nor "death." There is no way to call them, so they can only be called "demons."

### Is There a Heavenly Father? (2)

Secondly, we should also remember that human beings are closely related and interdependent; we receive help and benefits from others, and sometimes we are also affected by the bad things that others do. Because human beings are so closely connected, the "law of sacrifice" comes into play. In other words, someone often suffers for others, or some people suffer for the majority. In terms of these material disasters, it seems to say that some people must suffer so that the majority can survive. We may not be able to understand this point, but it is very clear that the world is made according to this plan. And on our part, we cannot say that there is another or better way to create the world. In this matter, our intelligence is not enough.

It may not be easy for us to understand this fact, but we should also remember that in raising humanity, the "law of sacrifice" is precisely a "law of progress." When these natural disasters occur, people are killed or suffer major losses, often arousing humanity to express its noblest qualities—to express morality, which may not be expressed in ordinary circumstances. The suffering of others causes heroic actions, and also moves people to express sympathy and generous assistance, all of which have the effect of raising humanity to a higher level. Moreover, these things also give people warnings, indicating the need to do everything possible to take precautions against such dangers. Because of these dangers, people living near volcanoes and earthquakes must find ways to build suitable houses that can withstand such shocks, or plant sandalwood trees, or protect forests, on the one hand, to prevent sudden floods, and on the other hand, to help prevent frequent famines.

Studying this issue from this perspective, we see that although these natural disasters cause many people to lose their lives and suffer, the result may benefit all mankind a great deal. Because from experience, people will gain much progress in understanding and grasping the forces of nature, able to control the greatest destructive power of natural disasters, or at least learn their time and season of occurrence, causes, and methods, and be able to avoid the worst consequences they cause.

From this point of view, it seems that some people in this world sometimes have to suffer for the benefit of the majority. Why is this? We don't know! However, if humanity generally benefits and generally progresses, we should not delay in saying that the God of humanity is not good. Instead, we should rely on His wisdom and believe that He has a plan to benefit humanity. As for those who encounter death in natural disasters, although it is unfortunate, we should remember that "death" is not an absolute disaster for the individual, because there is an afterlife beyond death.

Entertainment Circle

### Wartime Entertainment in Germany—Unexpectedly Deformed Prosperity

— Xiao Qi

Since Germany launched the war, according to the National Socialist Party's policy, all entertainment businesses were to be suspended first under wartime conditions. But this attempt was immediately found to be a mistake, and the plan to control the entertainment industry was changed, and even dance halls resumed business.

Now, in major cities in Germany, theaters, cinemas, cafes, nightclubs, and dance halls of all sizes have reopened one after another, and their business has unexpectedly become abnormally developed, even more lively than before the war. On Saturday nights, all places are packed, with extravagant extravagance, singing and dancing, and no one can tell that Germany is at war.

The plays staged in theaters emphasize the "art" aspect, and most of them are scripts with classical overtones, and comedies are rarely staged. However, small dance halls still restore the pre-war female nude performances and are not as serious as theaters.

In terms of movies, all cinemas screen German-made new films, and Italian and American films are only occasionally screened once or twice.

Nightclubs and dance halls are filled with jewelry and well-dressed guests, because people with money in their hands have no other use for it, so they pretend to take advantage of the good news of Germany's military victories in successive battles to enjoy themselves greatly. At the same time, many young people also want to indulge themselves and have fun before being conscripted.

### Meeting with Southern Movie Queen Li Qinian

— Jing Wen

Southern Movie Queen Li Qinian, who has been rumored for a long time to be coming to Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the 21st at 5:00 PM. The reporter, awed by the movie queen's great reputation, immediately visited Ms. Li at her temporary residence—the Jinmen Hotel.

In a very elegantly furnished room, I met the long-admired Ms. Li, an oval face with two intoxicating dimples. Although she had a bit of a tired look from traveling, her graceful and dignified manner was enough to prove that this southern movie queen was indeed worthy of her name.

What surprised me very much was that she was so frugal. In my ideal, she was determined to show off her clothing, be extraordinarily gorgeous, and extraordinary, when she came to Shanghai. I did not expect that she wore no makeup, and other than a blue cloth cheongsam, she wore no ornaments, but this kind of dress was even more sufficient to show her beauty—her many charms. This may be what the ancients praised as beauty, the so-called "disheveled hair and rough clothes, natural charm."

What surprised me even more was her fluent Mandarin, which almost made me think that she was not born in the South, but was a daughter of Youyan.

Looking at Ms. Li's facial contours, I couldn't help but recall the deceased generation of artist—Ruan Lingyu. Ms. Li's facial features really have a resemblance to Ms. Ruan. To be honest, among the actresses in the history of Chinese cinema, only Ms. Ruan's polished acting skills can make me fall in love, and it can be said that they can make the entire film audience fall in love unanimously.

Now that Ms. Ruan has died with regret and left the thousands of viewers. The successor of these polished acting skills, of course, we cannot but place infinite hope on Ms. Li, and at the same time, we hope that Ms. Li can develop and promote it. Then, Ms. Li's trip to Shanghai this time can be said to be worthwhile.

Work hard! Ms. Li! The crown of this polished acting skill is also waiting for you here.

According to the Sea Star Society, Li's first impression of Shanghai was that it was less beautiful than Hong Kong, but more magnificent. Li's physique is particularly healthy and beautiful, and her low frown and shallow smile are quite seductive, which is a different flavor from Chen Yunshang's petite and exquisite figure.

### Yang Shengchun's Battle of Puyang

— Only Me

The other day, I listened to Guqu's new play, "The Battle of Puyang" by Yang Shengchun, which was full of wonderful performances and was truly a masterpiece. It is impossible not to record it.

According to "The Battle of Puyang," this play is a martial arts play exclusive to Fuli Cheng. This play is a laborious play for martial arts actors, and it is extremely difficult to sing. The heaviness of the martial arts work is no less than "Eight Great Hammers," and although it is a heavy fight, there are many gestures, so it has the same wonderful effect as "Zhen Tanzhou." It is not suitable for young and strong people to sing (the role of Lu Bu must be handsome), and it is impossible to sing without a considerable foundation in martial arts. It is also impossible for young, strong, and martial arts people with a foundation to sing without good supporting roles, because the Dian Wei and Cao Cao in this play have a close relationship with the protagonist Lu Bu. It is difficult to be wonderful if they are not well-matched.

In the past, Ru Fulan was most famous for this play. At that time, Ru Fulan was young, handsome, and had good martial arts skills. He had all the conditions for singing "The Battle of Puyang." In addition, his hitting partner, Han Fuxin's Dian Wei, was wonderfully accurate, and the red flowers and green leaves complemented each other, which made a wonderful play. After Ru Fulan, this play was most able to be mobilized by Ye Shenglan, but after Shenglan left school, he had few opportunities to perform this play due to environmental constraints. So Yang Shengchun came from behind and performed this play wonderfully, with a general idea of replacing Ru Fulan.

Looking at Shengchun's performance, it can be said to be perfect. Those who can do this must also have the various conditions that Shengchun has said that he should have for acting in this play. (1) Shengchun is young and strong, and his appearance is unrestrained, which is exactly in line with Lu Bu's identity. His appearance when he enters the scene has the majesty of a great general, and his eyebrows show the spirit of a hero, without a trace of powder, which is valuable. (2) Shengchun's martial arts foundation is good, and his gestures and posture are very good-looking. There is an exit gesture that requires a halberd and feather, which matches the scene and is exactly in line with the drum beats. The entry of the last scene with the raised leg and big turn shows skill. (3) The fight is tight. This point is due to the good supporting roles. Han Shengxin's Dian Wei is extremely experienced and has a seamless fight with Shengchun. The fight scene in this play is the most laborious, because Dian Wei holds double halberds and Lu Bu holds a single halberd. It is extremely difficult to fight with halberds. Shengxin is Shengchun's old partner. When fighting, they fight together, neatly and crisply, which can be said to be wonderful. There are very few martial arts talents in recent times who sell their goods. Now, Shengchun's artistic ambition is really above the rest. If he can encourage himself, this child has great prospects.

### The Composition of Li Xiangjun

— Zou Xiao

Last night, I went to the Xuan Palace Theater to watch the performance of "Li Xiangjun," written by Mr. Zhou Yibai, which was full of seats and added benches, and the grand occasion was unprecedented.

This play was previously "The Peach Blossom Fan Legend" by Kong Shangren, and the Pingju opera "The Peach Blossom Fan" by Ouyang Yuqian. If adapted according to the original legend, the clues are too many and difficult to deal with. Yibai only selected about ten important characters to appear on stage, which was neither too many nor too few, and achieved the benefit of "saving clues."

Moreover, the structure is also very clear: it is almost entirely based on the relationships among Ruan Dacheng, Li Xiangjun, and Hou Chaozong as the center of the play. The first act writes about Ruan ordering General Wang to present treasures to Hou and Li, but they are rejected. The second act immediately writes about General Wang returning to report, and Ruan summons Xiangjun out of resentment and humiliates her. The third scene writes about Ruan instructing General Wang to force Xiangjun to marry Tian Yang, who refuses, hitting her head against the window and bleeding. Yang Wencong paints a peach blossom fan for her. The fourth act writes about Ruan forcing Xiangjun to enter the palace to perform "Yanzi Jian," when Nanjing is captured by the Qing soldiers, and Xiangjun escapes. The fifth act writes about the final meeting between Xiangjun and Chaozong, who has already left the mountains to take the Qing court exam. Xiangjun cries sadly and dies. Almost from the first act to the fourth act, Ruan Dacheng has always been the opponent of Hou and Li. Although Ruan's beard did not appear in the fifth scene, Liu Jingting pointed out that he had surrendered to the Qing Dynasty and died on Xianxia Ridge without anyone to collect his body. It makes people look with full attention and has a sense of coherence. Even the characters who appeared in the first four acts all borrowed the mouth of Liu Jingting to say their endings in the fifth act. The phrase "everything has been explained" is no different from the self-description of the master. Then, the point of "close needle shuttle" is also done very satisfactorily.

There is also a clever method, which is to borrow paintings to introduce the theme, such as Yu Danxin's poems in the third act and Wu Meicun's words in the fifth act, which are effortless and clever. This method seems to be that historical drama writers have not used it before.

The author is a textual researcher, so most of the events in the play are in line with historical facts. He does not treat Zheng Tuoniang and Yang Wencong as clowns, does not overemphasize Prince Fu, does not treat Ruan Dacheng as a Jing (only makes him a clown, let him say it himself, can sing), and does not regard Chaozong as a man of integrity. These are all places where he is cautious. And because he does not conceal Hou Chaozong's shortcomings, the fifth act is particularly wonderful, becoming a brush that previous families have not reached, which is especially worthy of praise.
