### Yunnan-Burma Road Blocked for Three Months: Britain Actually Reaches a Compromise with Japan; Churchill Explains Agreement with Japan in the House of Commons; British Press Discusses How Concessions Will Only Make Japan More Insatiable

London: News was received here last night from Tokyo confirming that Britain and Japan have reached an agreement to temporarily close the Burma Road to prevent supplies from being transported into China. (18th Reuters dispatch)

London: During a meeting of the House of Commons today, someone asked Prime Minister Churchill if he could comment on Japan's recent request to halt the transportation of supplies through Hong Kong and Burma to China. Churchill replied that on June 24th, the Japanese government requested that the British government take measures to stop military supplies and certain other goods from being transported to China via Burma. A similar request was made regarding Hong Kong. It was claimed that the continued transportation of these materials would have a serious impact on Anglo-Japanese relations. Currently, the British government has reached the following compromise agreement with the Japanese government: "Hong Kong": Since January 1939, the export of arms and ammunition from Hong Kong has been prohibited. In fact, there is currently no export of military materials valued by the Japanese government. "Burma": The Burmese government has agreed to suspend the transportation of arms, ammunition, automobiles, trucks, and railway materials to China for a period of three months. The same types of goods prohibited in Burma will also be prohibited in Hong Kong. When considering the Japanese government's request and negotiating the above agreement, the British government has not neglected the various obligations it has accepted, including those to the Chinese government and the relevant British territories. However, the British government must also consider the current world situation (cheers). Furthermore, the evident fact that we ourselves are currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle cannot be ignored. Britain's general policy regarding the Far Eastern dispute has been repeatedly clarified. We have firmly stated our desire to see China guaranteed a future of freedom and independence (cheers). We have also repeatedly expressed our willingness to improve relations with Japan. To achieve this goal, two things are particularly important: namely, time and the easing of tensions. On the one hand, the tense situation has rapidly escalated due to Japan's complaint that military supplies are being transported to China via the Burma Road. On the other hand, if we agree to permanently close the road, it would be tantamount to abandoning our obligations to a neutral country and friend, China. Therefore, what we have now negotiated is a temporary measure, hoping that within the time gained, a solution can be found that is fair and impartial to both China and Japan and freely acceptable to both parties. We do not wish to have a conflict with any country in the Far East. We wish to see China's position and integrity maintained. In our dispatch of January 14, 1939, we expressed our readiness to negotiate with the Chinese government after the restoration of peace to abolish consular jurisdiction, return concessions, and revise treaties on a basis of mutual benefit and equality. We also wish to see Japan achieve prosperity so that its people can obtain the happiness and economic stability that every Japanese person naturally desires. To enable both countries to achieve their goals, we are prepared to offer cooperation and contribution. However, one thing must be made clear: that if both countries wish to achieve these goals, they must do so through peaceful and conciliatory means, rather than war or the threat of war. (18th Reuters dispatch)

London: The Soviet ambassador to London, Maisky, visited the Foreign Office yesterday to meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Butler regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The British side has been constantly informing other relevant governments of this negotiation event. (18th Reuters dispatch)

London: The London Morning Post has published only two comments on the Burma Road issue to date. The Daily Mail said, "We must recognize reality. We are currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle alone with Germany and Italy and cannot afford to make Japan hostile to our country. Britain is willing to be friendly with Japan but does not want to obtain it through gradual concessions." Regarding the agreement as a whole, we can hope to firmly acknowledge Britain's rights in the Far East. The News Chronicle said, "From an opportunistic point of view, it would be possible to force a decision to close the Burma Road. We are now fully engaged in a great war and do not want to see a serious dispute arise in the Far East at this time, increasing the difficulty of coping. Since the United States does not wish to take effective action to extend its own objectives in the Far East, Britain can use this as another reason for its concessions to Japan. However, such a display of opportunism will not benefit our principles. The weakness we have already shown will encourage the new Japanese government to make even greater demands than it does today. It is of utmost importance that we maintain our morals today and prevent them from being tarnished." (18th Reuters dispatch)

London: A certain authoritative source received news last night stating that the Anglo-Japanese agreement to close the Burma Road for three months, until October 18th, was signed yesterday in Tokyo. It was stated that during the period of closure, Japan will seek a peaceful resolution with China. British sources reiterated that if Tokyo and Chongqing need it, Britain is willing to facilitate peace in East Asia. Chinese sources asked last night what Britain would do if the United States were to cut off its supply of arms to Britain in order to facilitate peace between Britain and Germany. British commentators said that this analogy is not valid because the United States is not in a war of survival in the West. British officials here solemnly declared that Britain has not authorized Japanese consular officials to inspect or prevent traffic from the Burma Road into the Chinese mainland. However, British authorities will allow the Japanese side to review the customs statistics after they have been accurately counted. In this regard, it is believed that the British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, quickly completed the Burma agreement before the old cabinet resigned for fear that the new Japanese government might not be as friendly as the Yonai cabinet. They believe that this was the Yonai government's attempt to resolve this matter quickly before the new people took office. (18th United Press dispatch)

American Newspapers Express Regret to Britain: A Grave Mistake Made Eight Years Ago

New York: The New York Herald Tribune recently published a commentary on the Anglo-Japanese agreement on the Burma Road, stating that the British concession is reportedly limited to three months, but no one who understands the situation in the East believes that Japan will allow the status quo to be restored when the deadline arrives. On the contrary, Japan will definitely demand more, knowing that British concessions are almost certain. The United States has no effective way to deal with this except to regret that Britain did not adopt a policy of appeasement eight years ago during the Manchurian Incident; otherwise, Japan would not have dared to insult the British Empire in this way today. (18th Reuters dispatch)

Washington: Secretary of State Hull yesterday reiterated the government's position on Britain's closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road and rejected reports that Germany had proposed that the United States protest Britain's blockade of Germany in order to be consistent with each other. Hull told the press here that blockades between belligerent countries are recognized by international law, while those via private routes in non-belligerent territories are governed by other provisions.

Editorial

### These Three Months

The Anglo-Japanese Burma transport agreement has been confirmed in both Tokyo and London. The agreement stipulates that the British government must prohibit weapons, bullets, gasoline, trucks, and railway materials from being transported to China via Burma for a period of three months, starting yesterday, July 18th, indicating that the agreement was concluded before yesterday.

British foreign affairs authorities made no explanations or strong defenses in their parliament regarding this issue, silently accepting the jeers of "Shameful!" and "Truly shameful!" from members of parliament. The general public in Britain has expressed outrage at this agreement to varying degrees; while some British sources have said that even if the Yunnan-Burma Road is blocked for three months, it will not have much impact on military supplies because the road is often plagued by torrential tropical rains in July, August, and September, making it impossible for trucks to travel. Furthermore, the National Government has planned ahead and stored ample military supplies, so it will not hinder the war of resistance, and so on. The facts on which these explanations are based are certainly credible; after all, July, August, and September are the rainy season in the Southwest, and the military supplies needed for the war of resistance in three or five months will certainly not rely on these three months of Yunnan-Burma Road transport. However, facts are facts and absolutely cannot be used to excuse Britain's abandonment of treaty morality. Therefore, the National Government's strong protest, with its stern wording and righteous arguments, has irrefutable basis, but it is not protesting because the military supplies for the war of resistance have been severely affected. In short, the direct interests involved are not significant, but the principles at stake must of course be fought for.

In terms of principles, the three-month suspension cannot be ignored. Furthermore, from another perspective, these three months are indeed an extremely important period internationally, and Britain's signing of this agreement only exposes cowardice and stupidity. Why is this an extremely important period internationally? First, Germany and Italy will immediately launch something against Britain. Assuming that what is launched is an important proposal with peace terms, then it should not be presumed beforehand that Britain will weigh the pros and cons and absolutely reject it; assuming that what is launched is a general offensive by the army, air force, and navy, then it should not be presumed beforehand that Britain will strongly resist it and absolutely not retreat. The current Germany, since successively conquering Poland, Norway, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, and with Italy joining the war and Romania changing its allegiance, is no longer the Germany confined to Central Europe. It is no longer worried about being blockaded and running out of resources and is gradually preparing for the conditions for a long war, but its war plan is still to achieve a quick victory; and it is rumored that the Führer Hitler has boasted that he will triumph over Britain by the end of July. The current Britain, although fighting alone, has repeatedly expressed its determination to fight a long-term war from the government to the people, and Prime Minister Churchill and his cabinet are full of vigor; but at least taking the Yunnan-Burma transport issue as an example, it can be proved that Britain is very likely to be like a divine dragon, with only its head visible and not its tail. Moreover, modern three-dimensional tactics are certainly not comparable to the two-dimensional positional warfare of previous years. Whether it is offense or defense, it is easy to distinguish victory and defeat. Therefore, we deeply feel that although the Anglo-German war has a magnificent momentum, it is not an accident that it can end within these three months.

Second, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has overthrown its cabinet four times, and now Konoe is back again. This fact illustrates the instability of the domestic political situation in Japan, which we will not discuss for the time being; but Konoe's re-appointment as prime minister, in his subjective desire to resolve what the Japanese call the China Incident, is what he unabashedly proclaims. Originally, in terms of Japan's objective conditions, it is impossible not to seek to stop the invasion and resolve the war. If it is not resolved, how will Japan support it? How will Konoe maintain it? How will he step down? Therefore, this time, putting forward Konoe, and even the so-called "New Structure," is actually Japan's last resort. Because of this, after Konoe comes to power, he will exert all his remaining strength, at home, to China, and to other countries, economically, diplomatically, and militarily, to make a new plan that opens up a new perspective. There is no need to speculate too much on the direction and content of the plan today. Taking Anglo-Japanese relations as an example, no matter whether the Burma suspension agreement stipulates only Britain's unilateral obligation to yield, even if there is, as some people in Britain "hear," that there are other exchanges, that there is other tacit understanding, but Konoe says to Britain that he will be bound by this agreement and that he will use this agreement as the basis for improving Anglo-Japanese relations, then no one in the world except the British would think so. Therefore, it is speculated that in these three months, after Japan launches its last resort, the international community must prepare for the coming of changes.

Third, the international situation is turbulent and changing in an instant, and there are three more noteworthy points today: the US presidential election in November, whether Roosevelt will break the precedent and run for a third term, is a major issue related to the United States and the world; last night's Chicago telegram reported that the Democratic Party has included Roosevelt in the list of candidates. The Soviet Union seems to have tacitly agreed with Germany and Italy and remained still in the Balkans after Romania yielded; but last night's news reported that Soviet troops have again occupied twelve villages in Romania; to know what happens next, we must wait and see. Spain has been enduring for a long time, and the Strait of Gibraltar, the throat of the Mediterranean, has long been controlled by the British, which is something that the Spanish have never forgotten; yesterday, the Spanish head of state Franco publicly demanded its return. These three things will all ferment within three months.

China's war of resistance is currently under deadlock and in stability. Although a major counteroffensive may not be imminent, it is not far off; but Britain's these three months will inevitably encounter unprecedented severe tests. Who will be the person to discuss and decide on the Burma transport issue after three months? It may also be left as a question for the time being; it is also a very reasonable phenomenon and development that China participates in the discussion at that time!

Hull stated here to the press that blockades between belligerent countries are recognized by international law, while those via private routes in non-belligerent territories are governed by other provisions. Once a belligerent country declares its belligerent rights, it enjoys the right of blockade at sea and may legally intercept goods and interfere with any non-neutral actions. As for private routes, they are governed by completely different regulations. The recent new restrictions on Sino-British traffic through Hong Kong and the Burma Road have been highlighted by a report from the Department of Commerce. The report stated that in May, Hong Kong exported 2 million pounds of tung oil, of which 1.69 million pounds were shipped to the United States and only 249,000 pounds were shipped to Europe. Department of Commerce officials said that as for the Yunnan-Burma Road, statistics are unavailable. (18th United Press dispatch)

Sir Cecil Hopes Government Will Consider Matters Carefully in the House of Lords

London: Sir Cecil said in the House of Lords yesterday that he did not want to embarrass the government at this time, but there was something he had to say, namely that negotiations with Japan had caused anxiety to a large portion of the public. Rumors that some people were using British influence to seek peace between China and Japan were noteworthy, so he asked the government to proceed with caution. As for the closure of the Burma Road, he hoped that the government would handle the matter with extreme care to avoid taking actions that would help Japan and suppress China. Sir Cecil claimed, "We allow the Burma Road to be used by private individuals or other parties to transport goods that will be sold to China or have already been sold to China. This is not a violation of neutrality. The normal use of trade routes is what we should enjoy. We all recognize that the situation is very serious, and I am very willing not to hinder the government from taking any steps it deems necessary to reduce the severity of the overall situation. However, I ask the government to consider whether making concessions to Japan under obvious threats can alleviate this severity. What we need to consider is not only the magnitude and immediate consequences of our actions, but also the ultimate consequences on which the final victory of the war depends." Foreign Secretary Halifax replied that he could not debate with Cecil at this time, but he was very sorry if Cecil or other lords thought that the government had not paid attention to this serious matter. He hoped to make a more detailed statement to the House of Lords tomorrow, and the House of Lords could wait patiently. (18th Reuters dispatch)

London: Labour MP Hugh Dalton asked Deputy Foreign Minister Butler in the House of Commons yesterday to explain in unambiguous terms that Britain was eager to avoid conflict with Japan but did not want to flatter Japan. Butler replied that he hoped that the detailed comments to be made public would explain the government's policy on this matter and satisfy the House of Commons, so he did not want to make any statements at this time.

Famous British Commentator Advocates Convening a Conference of the Five Great Powers

London: The News Chronicle today published a suggestion from Bartley, a famous commentator on international affairs, advocating convening a conference of the five great powers to discuss the Far East issue. It is said that Secretary of State Hull's declaration is sufficient to indicate a way to deal with the issue more bravely and solemnly. Given his position, Hull knows how difficult it would be for Britain to defend the Burma Road by force without assistance. A conference of the relevant powers—Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and Japan—is diplomatically possible. The Japanese also know Britain's difficulties, and there are various reasons to believe that the new Japanese government will be even more insistent on its demands than the previous government. However, they also know that Japan's current position cannot be enlarged by expanding the war. They cannot defeat China without supplies from the Western powers. They know that the Chinese are now very determined and will not allow any part of China to belong to Japan. Therefore, it may be possible to find a solution that allows the Japanese army to retreat from China while slightly conceding face and is approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek if they are willing to see an independent China discuss with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Still Says Agreement Is Not Extremely Satisfactory

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today in response to questions about the Anglo-Japanese Burma Road agreement that it was not extremely satisfactory. For the next three months, the Burma Road is in the rainy season, and transportation may not be very high, but the spokesman hoped that when transportation gradually becomes more frequent after the rainy season, the suspension of war materials on the road will be more strict. When asked about Britain's protest against Japan's suspension of shipping off the coast of Central and Southern China, the spokesman replied that he had seen this news in a certain newspaper and said that Japan's new actions were based on absolute military necessity. Shipping merchants of all countries must recognize that large-scale military operations are currently underway in China. This fact has been recognized by both Britain and France, so it is advisable for ships from third countries not to try to approach the designated areas in Central and Southern China. As for the safe harbors in the designated areas, the spokesman said that the climate can be predicted, and once the direction of the approaching hurricane is known, each ship can make the necessary preparations in advance.

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Navy Ministry detailed Secretary of State Hull's declaration opposing the closure of the Burma Road, saying that Japan's policies "will not be affected by the mere verbal gestures of a third party." (18th Reuters dispatch)

Chinese Transport Vehicles Begin to Move to Northwest Highway for Use

Chongqing: Due to the blockade of Southwest transport, the government has begun to transfer a large number of vehicles to Northwest transport for use to increase the transportation of goods. Subsequently, Chinese inland goods will reach the Soviet Union via the Xinjiang Highway. As of now, there are 1,000 vehicles traveling between China and the Soviet Union via the Xinjiang Highway. Although the Xinjiang Highway is twice as long as the Burma Road, it is still the safest route. (18th United Press dispatch)

Sino-American Cultural Association Cables Hull to Appeal

Chongqing: The Sino-American Cultural Association telegraphed Secretary of State Hull, saying, briefly, that the Chinese people deeply appreciate your steadfast position on the Yunnan-Burma transport issue. The diplomatic policy adopted by Britain in the spirit of the Munich Agreement will further destroy the peace and order in the Far East that has been painstakingly maintained by past and present statesmen in the United States. In order to uphold justice, please take active actions, such as completely stopping arms exports to Japan, so as to impose effective sanctions on the aggressor. Sincerely, Chu Ching-wei, Director-General of the Sino-American Cultural Association. (18th dispatch)

Chongqing: News of Britain's concession to Japan, agreeing to Japan's request to suspend transport to China via Burma, has caused deep indignation among people throughout China. Chu Chia-hua, President of the Chinese League of Nations Union, has telegraphed Sir Cecil, President of the League of Nations Union, asking him to advise the British government to rein in before it is too late. (18th dispatch)

Diplomatic Association Hopes Britain Will Cancel the Suspension Decision

Chongqing: The National Diplomatic Association believes that Britain's compromise with Japan today, blocking the Yunnan-Burma Road, is an unprecedentedly dishonorable event in British diplomatic history. Japan is invading China without daring to formally declare war and has no right to block traffic between third countries and China. Even if war has already been declared, it cannot interfere with the territory of third countries. Moreover, Britain has repeatedly stated that it will abide by the resolutions of the League of Nations and will not take any steps to weaken China's strength in the war of resistance. Today, it has violated its promises and illegally blocked the Zhen-Burma transport, which is not only unacceptable in law and morality, but also causes infinite damage to Britain's interests and security. Japan is getting an inch and will take a mile and will attack British territories in the Pacific. China's war of resistance is a matter of life and death for the entire nation and will not be stopped by Japan's threats or the obstruction of any third country. Japan's belief that blocking transport can "end the incident" is a foolish illusion. Moreover, China has long had sufficient preparations for military supplies, and its determination and policies for the war of resistance will not change in the slightest as a result. The association specifically wrote to the China Aid Committee in London with the above meaning, forwarding it to the British Parliament and the British people, hoping to advise the British government to quickly cancel the decision to suspend Burmese transport.

### Konoe Issues Statement: Drastic Changes in Japanese Policy; Three Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy Appointed; New Cabinet Will Be Dominated by the Army

Tokyo: Japan's new Prime Minister Konoe declared to Japanese journalists last night that the Japanese Prime Minister should cooperate closely with the Japanese military. Therefore, before forming the cabinet, he must hold talks with the Army Minister, Navy Minister, and Foreign Minister to discuss national defense and foreign affairs issues, decide on plans, and avoid divergent political views. Konoe pointed out that the talks would result in far-reaching changes in the political sphere, especially in the diplomatic sphere, but this reform is conditional on the complete coordination of the army, navy, and foreign policies. (18th dispatch, Haitong News Agency)

Tokyo: The President of the South Manchuria Railway, Matsuoka Yosuke, has been appointed as Foreign Minister. It is generally believed that the Konoe cabinet will be dominated by the army. Konoe appointed Lieutenant General Tojo Hideki, Director of Aviation, to the important post of Army Minister and requested that Yoshida Zengo continue to serve as Navy Minister. Baron Kido Koichi, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, summoned a meeting of senior politicians yesterday, and they unanimously recommended Konoe as Prime Minister. Konoe then appointed the three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs through an unusual procedure, and is currently consulting with the three ministers on foreign affairs, national defense, and other important policies. Konoe will recruit suitable personnel within the next three or four days to fill other positions in the cabinet based on the results of the discussions. Various signs indicate that the new cabinet is indeed right-leaning, and its mission is to refresh Japan and build a strong military policy. According to the Asahi Shimbun, former Army Minister Hata Shunroku explained the reasons for his resignation to Konoe, saying it was based on the military's strong desire to strengthen the political structure.

The failure of Britain and France in the European war has greatly changed the position of the United States in the Far East. American trade in China has encountered new and insurmountable obstacles.

In the first ballot, President Roosevelt's votes overwhelmed Vice President Garner, Senator Tydings, Secretary of State Hull, and the anti-Roosevelt opposition faction supporting Farley. According to unofficial reports, in the first ballot, President Roosevelt received 946.5 votes, Farley 72.5 votes, Garner 61 votes, Tydings 9.5 votes, Hull 6 votes, in addition to 3 spoiled ballots and 1.5 abstentions. However, news regarding whether President Roosevelt is willing to serve a third consecutive term is still unknown. The election was held at the same venue where President Roosevelt first became a candidate in July 1932, the sweltering arena. Although cheers were constantly heard before President Roosevelt's election, the convention proceeded according to its usual procedures. The names of three other individuals were also presented to the convention, namely Postmaster General Farley, Vice President Garner, and Maryland Democratic Senator Tydings, with Tydings being a prominent leader opposing Roosevelt, who strongly opposed President Roosevelt's third term. Roosevelt's election came after the delegates passed a resolution from the Resolutions Committee at 9 p.m., strongly supporting the New Deal and opposing war. After the isolationists prevailed in the debate, the convention decided to adopt a platform guaranteeing that the American military would only defend the Western Hemisphere and not be involved in wars elsewhere, the procedure for electing President Roosevelt then commenced. Simultaneously, Montana Senator Wheeler withdrew from the presidential race, claiming that President Roosevelt's staff had been engaged in campaigning and enabling President Roosevelt to be re-elected. The election of the vice-presidential candidate will be held tomorrow, after which the convention will adjourn. (18th dispatch, United Press)

Chicago: The Democratic Party convention has just elected Roosevelt as the Democratic presidential candidate in the first ballot with an absolute majority. After the vote count was completed, Postmaster General Farley proposed that Roosevelt be elected in a form of full support, and the audience welcomed the proposal with applause. Subsequently, spokespersons from each state seconded and supported Roosevelt's election one by one. Whenever a state announced its secondment, the attending delegates and people in the audience cheered. Before the vote, Senator Hill said that the whole country looked forward to Roosevelt, not just one state or one place, otherwise, the state of Alabama he represented would have nominated Bankhead. Congressman Ryan proposed an amendment that the president should not be re-elected for a third term, which was denounced by the delegates and was rejected. Senator Glass spoke, nominating Farley as the presidential candidate, and his speech also defended the traditional custom of the president not serving three consecutive terms, which shows that a small number of people are indeed opposed to Roosevelt's third election. The new Democratic Party platform was quickly adopted by the delegates, and the delegates lined up and paraded with flags in hand to show their welcome to the platform, accompanied by bands and piano, which increased the liveliness of the venue. Farley's proposal to elect Roosevelt unanimously in the whole house was met with the most enthusiastic support from the convention. The state of Texas was the first to change the votes originally for Garner to vote for Roosevelt, and Senator Tydings also voluntarily withdrew his right to be elected and supported Farley's proposal. Secretary of State Hull, although his name was not nominated, also asked to change the few votes he received to elect Roosevelt. (18th dispatch, Reuters)

Content of the Platform Passed by the Convention

Chicago: The 4,000-word Democratic Party platform, which was passed by the convention, stated that the American people are determined not to allow the wars currently taking place in Europe, Asia, and Africa to spread to the Americas, nor to participate in foreign wars. Except when attacked, they will not send their land, sea, and air forces to fight abroad. The United States must be strong enough that other countries, even if united, dare not attack the United States. The experience of other countries warns the United States that a comprehensive defense is the only way to resist insults, and a partial defense is equal to no defense. The United States will do its best to destroy the insidious activities of disguised anti-democratic and un-American organizations. In order to ensure that American armaments should be instruments of peace, the United States will continue its traditional good-neighbor policy, abide by and advocate international respect for the rights of other countries and treaty obligations, and promote commercial and economic cooperation with these Western Hemisphere republics. The United States, as the world's largest democracy, cannot remain indifferent or, in a spirit of appeasement, despise peace-loving people who are being recklessly attacked by aggressive countries, for the sake of self-defense and for the sake of conscience. The United States will assume the task of providing these people with all material assistance suitable for the law without hindering self-defense, so that peace and international faith can eventually prevail. The rest of the platform focuses on domestic affairs, recognizing the current rural programs, committing to continuing to enforce appropriate wage standards, and advocating convening a national unemployment conference. It also stated that the Democratic Party will continue to attack the unlimited concentration of economic power. The Republican Party's nomination of Willkie, a leading figure in public utilities, as its presidential candidate has raised the question of whether the nation's water resources should be used for the benefit of all people or for the profit of a few.

Chicago: Several members of the Democratic Party's drafting committee for the foreign policy platform reopened discussions yesterday after speaking with President Roosevelt by telephone.

House Speaker Bankhead later said that the entire 1940 platform has been unanimously agreed upon, and although there were debates on foreign policy, there were no major changes to the original plan.

Ottawa: Canadian Governor-General Athlone spoke at the Canadian Club yesterday, saying that when we say we are fighting for the King and the country, it is not just empty words.

Who would say that fighting for this is not appropriate? He traced back to his last few weeks in England, where he talked with the British every day. In addition to handling official duties, the King also carried out his own wartime duties, such as inspecting troops, factories, shipyards, and encouraging morale. All compatriots from all over the world who gathered in England, because of the King's encouragement, knew that from the King to the workers, everyone was trying their best to seek the final victory for the doctrine that most people in the world support. The King knows the seriousness of the situation and the necessity of unity better than anyone else. (18th dispatch, Reuters)

Madrid - A Spanish correspondent stationed in Berlin cabled that Hitler will propose peace at the end of the week. If rejected, Germany may immediately attack Britain.

British Air Minister warns the people

London - Air Minister Sinclair, in a broadcast to the Empire last night, said that a large-scale German attack on Britain from the sea, land, and air is bound to fail. The enemy air force, due to its numerical superiority, remains a serious threat. We must be prepared to face air attacks on a scale several times greater than before. However, so far, the enemy has only been able to inflict insignificant damage on us. We are not content with repelling attacking enemy aircraft, and we are also launching major attacks on Germany. The enemy now occupies a vast coastline and can invade Britain not only from bases in Germany, but also from Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, or France. Therefore, in addition to ceaseless maritime patrols, Britain must also pay attention to the above-mentioned locations, Sinclair continued, highly praising Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand pilots, saying that the self-governing dominions have valuable training space and can build an air force that is numerically stronger than Germany's. The sooner Britain takes the offensive, the sooner it will win. Since the beginning of this month, a total of 105 German planes have been shot down, while 24 British planes have been lost in combat with German planes. Moreover, the British Air Force flies into enemy territory to fight without ceasing, causing considerable damage to German war industries and transportation. (Reuters, 18th)

German newspaper comments on Churchill's speech

Berlin - According to the "Hamburger Ausland Zeitung," there is only one possible response to Churchill's speech, and that is a German attack.

In this situation, it would not be surprising if Churchill's prediction came true. Churchill is prepared to subject London to the same fate as Warsaw and Rotterdam, and knows that this destructive action cannot prevent Germany and Italy from rebuilding Europe. (Haitong, 18th)

### British Navy has an advantage in the Mediterranean Sea - Observations from an American Newspaper

New York - The New York Times stated in an editorial today that the Italian navy and air force have not yet blockaded the central Mediterranean Sea, preventing British warships from venturing in. The naval battle last week occurred in the central Mediterranean, in what Italy calls its territorial waters. According to Italian statements, British ships disregarded Italian air attacks, crossed the area safely, and escorted ships directly to their destination. From this, it can be seen that the British naval power has gained the upper hand in the initial engagement with the Italian air power, and the Italian claim that the Mediterranean is its territorial sea is still just empty talk.

Berlin - According to a German official document, it denies the British claim that Sweden allows German troops to pass through its territory, facilitating the German attack on Britain. It strongly states that Britain had requested Sweden to allow British troops to pass through its territory to interfere in the Soviet-Finnish war. Sweden refused this request, thus avoiding being drawn into the war. The current German-Swedish agreement is different in nature.

The Romanian troops retreated without any resistance. At the same time, well-informed sources believe that the Soviet Union's actions are creating a new friction between Germany and the Soviet Union, because Germany supports Romania's departure from the Balkan Small Entente.

### British House of Commons questions the child evacuation plan. The Labor Party advocates eliminating class distinctions.

London - The House of Commons last night again questioned the plan to send British children to self-governing dominions and the United States, and strongly advocated eliminating class distinctions. Labor Party member Griffiths said that the people want to hear whether the plan is suspended or whether an announcement is made to abolish it. If it is impossible to evacuate children from all classes, then the government should prevent the children of wealthy families from leaving the country. Labor Party members are very disturbed by the fact that the children of cabinet members have already left the country. Prime Minister Churchill recently asked senior officials to set an example for the people, but those in high positions have not set the best example. Their actions are hated and give the people the impression that Britain is still ruled by the aristocracy. Conservative Party member Braithwaite asked whether the government would allow the United States to send ships to pick up the children. 4,000 people have registered with the American committee in the past two days. The committee will send them out as soon as ships are available. He hopes that under this plan, children who cannot afford the ship fare can get help. Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Shakespeare replied that he has been ordered to proceed with preparations, and the children will be sent as soon as the situation improves. The reason for the suspension is only because of the military situation. As for the matter of the United States sending ships to pick up British children, there is no formal proposal for this at present. If there is one, the government will definitely consider it. The self-governing dominions and the United States have all agreed to take in 50,000 British children each. (Reuters, 18th)

### French Foreign Minister announces foreign policy. Adopts a wait-and-see attitude.

Geneva - According to French Foreign Minister Baudouin to a "Journal de Genève" interviewer, France's current diplomacy, can only take "waiting and watching" policy. Because the peace has not yet been signed, France's relations with Germany and Italy are limited to the negotiations of the armistice commission. France has been defeated in battle and cannot make certain initiations, but France's honor, dignity and calm attitude should not be violated. France severed diplomatic relations with Britain, but Britain recalled its envoy to France on June 20 and isolated itself from France. Later, the events of Oran and other attacks completely severed British-French relations. Baudouin mentioned economic issues, briefly stating that economic life is based on cooperation. France must trade with Germany and Italy, and also with Britain and other countries. The countries of Europe, due to geographical and cultural ties, will form closer relations. (Haitong, 18th)

### South African coastal shipping is prosperous.

Pretoria - South African Railways and Ports Minister Sturrock told a Reuters interviewer yesterday that shipping around the South African coast is prosperous and smooth, proving the absurdity of Nazi propaganda that Germany has blockaded British Empire trade. According to the latest South African trade figures, the tonnage of ships entering and leaving South African ports has increased. With Mediterranean shipping blocked, South African ports are extremely busy. (Reuters, 18th)

### All Iron Gates in the French Concession Are Closed; Tram Workers' Strike Gradually Intensifies; Traffic in Southern City Temporarily Cut Off to Prevent Disputes; Tram Workers Continued Working as Usual Yesterday; Rumors of Political Instigation Behind the Scenes

The iron gates along the Chinese boundary of the French Concession at Xinkai River, Xinqiao Street, and Nanyang Bridge, which had been open for a long time, were all closed uniformly from yesterday morning, completely severing female communication between the Southern City and the French Concession. Residents of the Southern City who wanted to enter the concession had to detour through Pudong, resulting in a threefold increase in business for all ferries. It is reported that the reason why the French authorities suddenly closed the iron gates is related to the copper workers' strike in the French Tram Company. It is understood that the French authorities have detected that most of the striking workers reside in the Southern City, and there are rumors of meetings being held to discuss expansion. The French Concession police, in order to maintain public utilities and order within the concession, had no choice but to temporarily close the gates. Details of each situation are recorded as follows:

Negotiations Break Down; Workers Simultaneously Go on Strike

More than 700 copper workers from the machinery department of the French Tram Company at 249 Rue Lyons have recently requested a 30% salary increase from the company due to difficult living conditions. However, according to labor sources, the labor's demand is for the company to subsidize the amount exceeding 50 yuan when the rice price exceeds 50 yuan, while the company only agreed to subsidize 4.5 yuan for the amount exceeding 50 yuan. As a result, the two sides had differing opinions and the matter was delayed. The labor side set a deadline for the company to reply by 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, but the company insisted on negotiating at 5:00 PM yesterday. Therefore, the labor side simultaneously went on strike at around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday.

Trams and Buses Run as Usual

After receiving the news, the responsible police department immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to maintain order. The striking workers all left the company. The rumors that the strikers were the company's drivers and that all French trams and public buses on routes 21 and 22 had stopped running for an hour the night before were not true. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, it was learned from the company yesterday that most of the workers participating in the strike reside in the Southern City, and they all went to the Southern City to gather and discuss after the strike, and there were also reports of them participating in the so-called "Workers' Welfare Association."

All Border Iron Gates Closed
Therefore, in order to prevent other workers in the company from being seduced or other accidents from occurring, the company agreed with the French Concession police authorities yesterday morning to temporarily close all the iron gates of the French Concession bordering the Southern City, such as Nanyang Bridge, Xinqiao Street, and Xinkai River, from 7:30 AM yesterday, stopping traffic. As a result, some people who wanted to pass through were trapped inside and outside the iron gates and could not pass through. According to police authorities, the closure will remain in effect until the strike is completely resolved, so it is expected that traffic between the French Concession and the Southern City will not be restored for a few days.

Police Take Strict Precautions
Since the copper workers of the French Tram Company went on strike, the French Concession authorities, fearing actions that would disrupt public order, have taken strict precautions near the tram company on Rue Lyons. An armored car was parked at the side door of the tram company on Kangti Road, guarded by four French Huajie police officers with guns. Another armored car was parked in front of the main gate, and more than 20 French Huajie police officers were on strict guard. The situation was quite tense. Since the copper workers went on strike, there have been many vehicles awaiting repair at the company, and vehicles that must be repaired before they can run every day are now also stranded.

The Company's Attitude

Company staff believe that this strike is purely a kind of political development, so they advocate that the management should maintain a firm and unyielding attitude towards the workers' demands for increased wages and rice subsidies. These staff members pointed out that the tram company's management had previously stated that it was prepared to consider any reasonable demands put forward by the workers, as long as the motives for these demands were genuine needs and made in a peaceful manner. However, when accepting most of the demands put forward by the workers three months ago, it was said that the company authorities warned the workers that anyone who was instigated by political parties to pester the management would be rebuffed. It was found that when the strike was first launched, only 200 workers joined the strike, but now it has expanded to 700 people. However, drivers, ticket sellers, and ticket inspectors have not participated, so the public bus and tram services can still proceed as usual.

Someone Else Is Behind the Instigation

According to company staff, the strike was actually instigated by someone. Company manager Feifeili neither confirmed nor denied this news, but said that the 700 workers currently on strike, who insist on their "excessive demands," will make it possible for the French Concession's buses and trams to stop completely in less than two weeks. Fei said that the wages earned by the workers of the French Tram Company are not inferior to those of workers employed by major firms in this port, and now the negotiations between the management and worker representatives have broken down.

Qiuxin Shipyard Also Went on Strike Yesterday

All the workers of the French Qiuxin Shipyard on Jichang Street in the Southern City, in order to express their support for the French water and electricity colleagues, also took consistent action from yesterday morning. At the same time, the French water and electricity company's tap water pavilion and machinery factory on Jichang Street is also located there, which draws water from the Huangpu River and connects to the Lujiawan main water distribution cabinet in the French Concession, supplying users in the entire French Concession. It is quite important, so the factory has hired French and Russian craftsmen to work in shifts to avoid interruption. A water storage pool has long been built in the underground of the French Garden, which is sufficient for many hours of need.

### This Newspaper Received a Telegram from Zhenhai; Local Situation is Stable; Japanese Warships Gather in Hangzhou Bay; Chinese Army Uses Containment Strategy Along the River

This newspaper received the latest news at 0:35 this morning, saying that the Zhenhai County Government and the County Public Security Bureau had relocated their offices due to the emergency situation, but returned to their original locations yesterday afternoon. The local situation is extremely stable.

Since the Japanese side blockaded the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian at midnight on the 15th, fierce artillery battles have been taking place outside Zhenhai Port for days. Yesterday, the battle did not stop all day and intensified. The garrison of Zhenhai Fortress calmly fought back and launched a fierce counterattack under the intensive Japanese artillery fire. A medium-sized Japanese warship was hit by more than ten shells and sank within minutes. Five other ships were injured and fled in panic. The remnants of the White Chicken Mountain were completely wiped out on the 17th night after being encircled and suppressed by the Chinese. Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaohong and Commander-in-Chief of the ×th Army Corps Liu Jianxu have both arrived at the defense line to command due to the serious situation in eastern Zhejiang, and have transferred large numbers of elite troops from 囗囗 and 囗囗 to reinforce Yongzhen. Morale is high, the military appearance is strong, and the people are at peace. They are determined to annihilate all invading Japanese troops.

Containment Strategy

After the Japanese troops on White Chicken Mountain were eliminated, the Chinese authorities immediately stationed heavy troops there and at Chuanshan and Chaiqiao to prevent Japanese troops from invading. In the Zhenhai Qiliqi Ligang area, in addition to the five injured and one sunk Japanese warships, there are more than ten other ships anchored in the waters there, and two Japanese planes flew to Zhensi to bomb indiscriminately. The bombs fell on wasteland. After a fierce shooting by the Chinese air defense troops, they fled. At the same time, Chinese guerrillas in Xiaoshan, Fuchun River, Hangzhou, and the four suburbs all dispatched separately to contain Japanese reinforcements.

Shanghai-Ningbo Telegraph

From dawn to noon yesterday, because no telegrams from Yongzhen arrived, the Japanese and speculative merchants fabricated rumors again, saying that Zhenhai had been landed. However, at 1:00 PM, Ningbo merchants received a telegram saying, "Chinese troops gather, Liu (Jianxu) Huang (Shao　) personally went to the front line to command, Yongzhen is as peaceful as ever." Ningbo postal and telegraph exchanges are also still smooth. However, it was rumored again last night that telecommunications were interrupted.

Japanese Warships Appear

The coastline of Hangzhou Bay is winding and stretches for hundreds of miles. At each port, such as Yuyao, Andong, 　Shanwei, Cixi, Guanhaiwei, Zhenhai, Longshan, Fenghua, and Houtoudu, Japanese planes and warships appear, shining with sea-searching lights at night, which are dazzling. The intention is unclear, but the local people are able to deal with them calmly. The number of Japanese warships has increased to 29, surrounding the waters of Zhenhai Ligang. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired from the Ningbo Shanghai group last night, Xiaogang, Zhenhai (south of the Grand Canyon), was once landed by Japanese troops on the 17th and was bravely repelled by our garrison. Furthermore, at the Hengshan Pier in Dongxiang Binhai, Yinxian, Ningbo, a battle once broke out on the afternoon of the 16th. The Japanese warships fled after the garrison opened fire. At 4:00 PM on the 16th, three Japanese planes dropped four bombs on Zhenhai Meilu. After investigation, there were no casualties of people or animals.

Oil Tanker Detained

The English-language Greater American Evening Post reported that after the Japanese began blockading the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian a few days ago, the British-owned Asia Petroleum Company's Chuguang (transliteration) ship, which was docked in Ningbo, did not sail out, resulting in its detention by the Japanese naval authorities for 16 hours. It was only released this morning (18th). It is heard that British and Japanese authorities are not taking this matter seriously, as they believe that the ship may not have received the Japanese military's notice to gather in the area. According to Jinong, nine British ships, seven Portuguese ships, and several foreign ships from other countries have all received the Japanese blockade news and sailed away from Ningbo and Zhenhai, but the Chuguang did not sail away within the time limit set by the Japanese authorities, resulting in its detention. A Japanese naval spokesperson stated this morning that the matter should be investigated to determine whether the captain of the ship was aware of the Japanese notice. It is expected that the Chuguang will return to Shanghai this afternoon and will dock at the Asia Wharf in Pudong.

Postal Delivery Routes

The Shanghai Postal Administration is still dredging the delivery of light mail to the Zhejiang and Fujian areas. According to a senior postal official from the Transportation Department of the Bureau who spoke to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, since the seaports of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded, all navigation ships have stopped sailing one after another, so the mail received from Zhejiang and Fujian since the 16th has not been sent out. It is now planned that (1) eastern Zhejiang will be re-routed via Hangzhou, and (2) Fuzhou will be re-routed via Guangzhou. However, no formal decision has been made as of last night.

### Foreign Ships Resume Navigation to Xinghua and Quanzhou; Customs Clearance Not Completed Yesterday; Ships Sailing to Yongzhen Decide to Temporarily Dock in Shanghai; Ships Sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou Line Were Approved Yesterday

Since the commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China announced the blockade of the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian, foreign shipping companies, in order to maintain their shipping business with China, decided to find ways to send ships to resume sailing in addition to reporting to their respective consuls in Shanghai to negotiate with Japan. The German-owned Gaodeng ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Songmen and Wanligang today. The Shenfu, Yongfeng, and Xinanna ships are scheduled to sail to Xinghua and Quanzhou within the next few days. However, navigation to Ningbo has been temporarily suspended due to military actions in Zhenhai.

Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Routes

Foreign shipping companies are preparing to resume navigation to Xinghua and Quanzhou ports in Fujian: (1) The British-owned Yilong Company's Shenfu ship completed customs clearance at Sanjiangkou yesterday and was approved to export from Shanghai today. The Shenyou ship is now waiting at Sanjiangkou and it has been decided that several ships will sail this route in the future. It is heard that the schedule can be arranged within the next week. (2) The British-owned Yongfeng ship, managed by the Fusheng Company, plans to sail from Shanghai to Xinghua and Quanzhou within the next few days, but customs clearance was not seen yesterday. (3) The British-owned 　Ciyang Company's Xinanna ship is scheduled to load cargo in Shanghai and sail to Quanzhou today. Customs clearance was also not seen yesterday. However, there are no ships sailing to Sandu'ao and Fuzhou for the time being.

Japanese Ship Itinerary

The Lower Temple of Baoben Hall of Putuoshan and the South Department of the East China Shipping Bureau dispatched three Japanese ships, Changrong, Chenli, and Lianfeng, to sail exclusively between Shanghai and Putuoshan, departing once every two days. The ships dock at the Guangxin Wharf in Yangshupu. It is heard that the Lianfeng ship has already raised its anchor from Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday. The ticket price is uniformly 12 yuan. Their external publicity is to facilitate pilgrimage to Putuo Guanyin's birthday, but because the situation on the mountain has not become peaceful, there are few passengers. As for those who go to the mountain to escape the summer heat, it can be said that there are none.

Ligang Navigation

The German-owned Lulin Trading Company's Gaodeng ship published a shipping schedule advertisement yesterday: "Departing for Songmen and Wanligang at 5:00 PM on July 19." However, according to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, it was learned that the ship has decided to stop sailing to Songmen (outside the Haimen Jiaojiang Port) and will go directly from Shanghai to Ligang (a small island outside Zhenhai Port). As for the German-owned Haiyi ship, which sailed from Shanghai to Ligang the day before yesterday, it arrived safely at Ligang yesterday afternoon.

Yongzhen Suspension

Foreign merchant ships sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Zhen lines have temporarily suspended navigation because the Japanese side used the excuse that there were military actions in Zhenhai and are waiting for the resumption order from their respective consuls. The foreign ships docked in Shanghai include Deping, Shantong, Hana, Jiangding, Ruitai, Jiangsu, Haifu, Changde, and Avima Li. Those fearing repairs at Yongjiang include Kaisideng. The Shanghai Customs has even agreed to the Japanese request and refused customs clearance for merchant ships of various countries wishing to sail to Ningbo and Zhenhai.

Sailing Wenzhou Ship
The German-owned Lulin Trading Company's Feikang ship and the British ship Ka Siding, represented by the American-owned Weili Han Company, which sailed the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, have recently unloaded cargo in Wenzhou. Yesterday, the Fdiath Mmoller ship cleared customs and is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou today. The ships that have been notified to temporarily suspend navigation include Chang Youli and Anna, and are also waiting for the orders of their respective consuls. As for the Baoli ship of the Italian-owned Yihua Trading Company, which sailed from Shanghai to Yueqing last Sunday, there is no telegram as to whether it has arrived at its destination. However, the shipping company plans to send ships to sail, as there are no battles in Wenzhou.

### Withdrawal of Italian Troops from Tianjin is Absolutely Untrue; Japanese Side Also Says They Are Unaware

The Shanghai Times reported that it was recently rumored that the Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai would withdraw to Tianjin. According to the Japanese Embassy spokesperson Hejianxian, this statement is mostly a rumor and he has not heard of it. However, if this statement is true and the troops of all belligerent countries withdraw from this city, as advocated by Nanjing and the Japanese authorities, it will be beneficial to Shanghai. It is also rumored that the Italian troops stationed in Shanghai are willing to withdraw, but do not want to leave Shanghai first. When this statement was posed to an Italian military officer, the reply was that from now on, the Italian side would not release any information to the press.

### Anti-British Leaflets Found in German City

Recently, various anti-British leaflets have been found repeatedly in this port, posted on streets and telephone poles. The Zi Lin West Newspaper reported yesterday that the printed matter issued by the so-called "Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Expulsion of British People Association" depicted a map of Shanghai and the defense fleets of the British, American, and French forces at the top, and indicated that British soldiers would soon be driven out of Shanghai, followed by a "Another Warning to Britain" and a signed name. The source of the leaflets is still unclear.

### Thugs Who Attacked This Newspaper Will Be Sent to Court Today; Thugs Fully Confessed After Interrogation; Police Released the Investigation Process of This Case

The English-language Greater American Evening Post reported that, according to a statement released by the Public Concession Police, the bombing of the Shenbao Building on Tuesday morning was carried out by members of the "East Asia Anti-Communist League." In this atrocity, one person was killed and 18 injured. According to the police report, the suspect Huang Biaoqing (transliteration), who was arrested near the Shenbao Building during the attack, confessed to the police about the attack and admitted his part in the case, and demonstrated to the police.

Three Others Came; One Was Arrested

According to the police report, one of the bombers was arrested by a plainclothes police officer from the Old Zhabei Police Station as the three attempted to escape along Shanxi Road near Jiujiang Road. When he was taken to the police station, a vaccination certificate was found on his person, with the following Chinese sentences written on the back: "Chen Yiyou (transliteration), No. 20 Guihua Lane (transliteration) near Lafayette Road, Caishi Road, French Concession, I want to borrow some money from you. I don't know if you are willing. How much do you want? A few days later." Next to Huang was also a red piece of paper, obviously torn from another large piece of paper, with the Chinese characters "East Asia Anti-Communist League" written on it. In addition, there were 16 yuan in cash.

Careful Interrogation; Direct Admission

The suspect confessed that his name was Huang Biaoqing, also known as A Biao, 33 years old, from Ningbo, unemployed, and lived at No. 10 Yongfu Lane (transliteration), Glock Road. When first interrogated, he denied having done anything in the case, but after a few hours of careful interrogation, he confessed about it and made a statement. He claimed that for the past two years, he had been working in various teahouses and living with his mistress at No. 10 Yongfu Lane, Lane 118, Glock Road, French Concession. At the end of June this year, he met his friend Chen Changgong (transliteration), who invited him to join the "East Asia Anti-Communist League" as a "member." On July 8, he met this person again on North Henan Road and agreed to join the "League." This person led him to a place on Feihong Road in Zhabei and introduced him to two members of the "League" named Sun and Liu. They especially made him a member and told him that he could get a subsidy of 40 yuan per month, and told him to go to the "League" every morning. On July 9, he went there again and Chen Changgong gave him a badge. He then went there every day.

First Came to Inspect; Bombing the Next Day

On July 14, he was told that they would bomb the Shenbao Building. The next day, he and Chen went to inspect the Shenbao Building. On the afternoon of July 15, he, Chen, Liu, and Sun gathered in Room 7 of the Xin Luming Hotel at No. 25 Shanxi Road and discussed in the room. Chen Changgong brought four hand grenades to the hotel. On the morning of July 16, he and Zhang each took two hand grenades and left the hotel together. Sun and Liu followed closely behind. The hand grenades were wrapped in newspapers. The arrested person and Chen walked along Shanxi Road to Hankou Road, and then from Hankou Road to near the Shenbao Building, each person a short distance apart. The arrested person was then at the north end of the road. He saw Chen throw the two hand grenades in his newspaper package into the glass windows of the Shenbao Building and immediately turned and fled. He also opened the hand grenades in the newspaper and pulled out the fuse, throwing two grenades at the entrance corner of the Shenbao Building. He then fled westward, turned north on Shanxi Road, but was caught by a plainclothes police officer. As for the whereabouts of Chen, Liu, and Sun, he did not know.

Demonstration After Arrest

The suspect led the detectives to the above-mentioned hotel, where the teahouse waiter proved that the arrested person had been staying in the room opened at 2:00 PM on the 15th. He then led the detectives, together with detectives from the French Police Station, to his residence and found the badge he had described. The badge had the words "East Asia Anti-Communist League" written on it, and the number 1093 was engraved on one side of the back. The arrested person was then taken to the vicinity of the Shenbao Building, where he re-enacted the circumstances of his crime. He is now being detained at the Central Police Station and will be sent to court for trial on the 19th (i.e., today).

### Hurricane Advancing; Chinese Coastline Threatened; High Tide in Huangpu River Since Yesterday

According to the above report, the hurricane has reached southeast of Luzon and is advancing towards the Chinese coast. Shanghai is threatened by it.

### Yunnan-Burma Road is Blockaded; China-Soviet Union Highway is Open; The Road Transports 3,000 Tons of Military Supplies Monthly; China's Source of Military Supplies is Still Endless

After several brewing sessions, the news of the British and Japanese negotiations in Tokyo on the blockade of Yunnan-Burma traffic problems has been heard again, and it has been settled by compromise. Britain believes that it is in a dangerous situation in Europe, so it tries its best to avoid all possible new disputes and make its position more difficult. In addition, the Mini Cabinet, which relies on the British and Americans, has collapsed, and it is deeply feared that Konoe will take the stage and make even more demands. Therefore, on the eve of Konoe's cabinet formation, it hastily sang with Japan and cast a serious mistake. Although the Chinese side quite understands Britain's difficulties, it cannot tolerate this act of violating international obligations. However, in fact, before the rainy season on the Burma Road, the Chinese side had made preparations for military supplies long ago and had no fear. Moreover, with the Yunnan-Burma Road closed, the China-Soviet Union Highway, the international artery in the northwest, is still unobstructed, and its position is becoming more and more important and is attracting worldwide attention.

Transportation Situation on the China-Soviet Union Highway

The China-Soviet Union Highway stretches across northwest China for 2,500 miles, and the area it passes through has vertical and horizontal mountains, which takes time to transport, and the consumption of gasoline is huge. Therefore, in the past, the China-Soviet Union Highway was only limited to transporting military supplies. According to Japanese reports, the road transports 3,000 tons of military supplies per month. The goods transported from China to the Soviet Union mostly take the road through 　 and are transported to Hong Kong and then to Vladivostok or various Soviet ports in the Black Sea. In the future, heavy-duty vehicles traveling to various 　 in the southwest will not be difficult to change to the northwest, so China's source of military supplies will remain continuous. However, the export of tung oil and 　 sand will inevitably be stopped due to the heavy weight. This is because there is a relationship of repaying American debts with goods, so the United States first suffered losses, and tung oil is also necessary for American industry. Therefore, the US government is firmly 　　 against the blockade of Yunnan-Burma traffic.

### Early Rice in Jiaxing Zhoupu is on the Market; Great Relationship with People's Food

According to Xiangren who came to Shanghai, early rice in Jiaxing Zhoupu and its near suburbs can be harvested, and the grains are like pearls and the grass stalks are thick and large. The villagers are all smiling and preparing to harvest. As for the late rice, it is being sown and inserted. Recently, because the rainfall is uniform, the farmland has no sense of lack. It is said that although the amount of early rice is quite fresh, it has a great relationship in regulating the entire people's food in Shanghai. Moreover, the collection and transportation are more convenient. At that time, general sales merchants will go to each production area to purchase a large amount and transport it to Shanghai for relief. It is also learned that the source of foreign rice continues to arrive. Of the 10,000 tons ordered by the rice industry, most have been loaded on wheels and are on their way to Shanghai and will arrive in succession around the end of the month. Also, the first batch of broken rice ordered by the Ping Tiao Committee will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

### Price of Coal Briquettes Awaits Reduction

The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association has been handling the seventh phase of subsidized coal briquette sales. Since sales began on the 10th of this month, a total of 11,500 dan of coal briquettes have been sold, with a value of 69,000 national currency. This phase of subsidized sales is scheduled to end as planned. It is reported that the source of coal dust has been increasing recently, and the production price has also decreased. Therefore, the manufacturing cost of coal briquettes has been reduced compared to before. The selling price of non-subsidized coal briquettes urgently needs to be reduced. The Coal Briquette Association will hold a meeting to discuss the continuation of subsidized coal briquette sales and the reduction of the market price of non-subsidized coal briquettes.

### Reason for Hou Yanli's Murder: Embezzlement of Gambling Den Profits; Several Gambling Den Bosses Colluded; Hou Failed to Escape and Was "Punished"

The Continental Press reports that yesterday (the 17th), the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department disclosed that Hou Yanli, a guest at a certain number of the Dahua Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road, was assassinated on the afternoon of the 16th at 9:30 pm, due to a drastic shake-up in the controlling class of gambling dens in the badlands of western Shanghai. Chinese people who controlled the gambling dens in this city have recently fled Shanghai due to life-threatening situations. Hou Yanli was one of them, but he failed to escape and was shot dead by three assassins. It is said that the former head of the gambling den "management office" was forced to flee after pocketing a portion of the gambling den's profits for himself. Hou Yanli colluded with him and was "punished" by the badlands side. It was also rumored yesterday that the "Municipal Government" had ordered all gambling dens in the badlands to close for three days. It is widely believed that the gambling dens will temporarily close until the new "management office" hands over the demanded "protection fee" before reopening. According to reliable sources, the gambling dens had recently temporarily closed and then reopened after paying a "fee" of 100,000 yuan each. There are currently nine large gambling dens and three small gambling dens in the badlands. Although yesterday was close to the reported closure time, the gambling business was still booming.

### Stealing a Friend's Wife Sentenced to One and a Half Years; The Husband Acquitted

Pan Juquan (22 years old), a sand turner from Wuxi, was wandering around due to his dissolute nature and recent unemployment, leaving him homeless. At around 4:00 pm on the 10th of this month, he met Xue Sanbao, also a sand turner from the same hometown, near Yuezhou Road. Xue, a former colleague, invited him to Xue's house at No. 3, Lane 288 on the same road for dinner. That night, he temporarily stayed on the third-floor loft.

Judge Qian sentenced Chen Ruihua to two years of imprisonment for continuous use of forged private documents, while Lu Ruixin was found not guilty. Chen refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, Judge Zhou opened the first criminal court to hear the case. The appellant Chen Ruihua stated in his testimony: "I did not intend to embezzle, but to misappropriate temporarily as speculative capital. Later, I failed, and after being discovered by the manager, I tried to repay it. The trial judge in the first instance believed that I was involved in speculative ventures and was not a good person, so he sentenced me to two years of imprisonment. I am not willing to accept this and appeal to your court, asking the judge for leniency." After reviewing the evidence, the court ordered a change of date to await verification and then adjourned.

### Sichuan Province's New County System Implemented Smoothly; Actively Training National Education Teachers; Appropriately Increasing the Salaries of Elementary School Teachers

(Chengdu Airmail) The Central Government promulgated the outline of county-level organizations to promote local autonomy. Sichuan Province first implemented it on March 1 of this year. Because Chengdu has more abundant funds and manpower and made full preparations in advance, it was fully realized within March. The adjustment of the municipal government and Baojia organizations has been completed, and the central township schools and Bao National Schools have also been completed in sequence. As of the end of June, other counties and cities have also completed the county government and Baojia institutions successively. Therefore, as of the end of June, Sichuan Province's implementation of the new county system has been roughly completed in terms of organizational structure. Although personnel training has been partially started since May 1, the entire training work started on July 1. More than 20,000 people throughout Sichuan are being trained due to the implementation of the new county system. The popularization of national education in Sichuan is scheduled to begin on August 1 and be completed in three years. The Provincial Government established the Sichuan Provincial National Education Committee in early July to be responsible for promoting it. Premier Chiang Kai-shek of the Executive Yuan instructed that the new county system in Sichuan should be completed within three years. The planned work for the first year is progressing smoothly and is expected to be completed on schedule.

Civil and Education Commissioners Inspect Various Counties

In order to inspect the implementation of the new county system in various counties, the Provincial Government specially sent Hu Juewei, Commissioner of Civil Affairs, and Guo Youshou, Commissioner of Education, to depart from Chengdu on May 22 to inspect eastern, northern, and southern Sichuan. They returned to the province on June 28, lasting 37 days. They traveled through 22 counties and cities, gave 36 speeches, explained the government's essentials and detailed methods for implementing the new county system, and attracted more than 35,000 listeners. Overall, the implementation of the new county system in various places has achieved generally good results. Commissioners and county heads have worked extremely hard to promote the new system, especially in the 10th and 11th districts, where the results are the best. The 10th district established township offices on June 1 and decided to establish central township schools and Bao National Schools uniformly starting from September 1. The 3rd and 7th districts also convened administrative meetings and decided to establish one central school in each township and one national school in each Bao within one year. Regarding township Bao issues, the 6th, 10th, and 11th districts have formulated specific plans and are actively promoting them. The 3rd and 7th districts have the largest number of training classes in each district. Township chiefs, section chiefs, and financial personnel have been convened for training, totaling more than 600 people. The educational qualifications of the students are better in the 3rd district, with more than 40 university graduates and 50 vocational school graduates. The discipline and spirit of the students are best in the 7th district. The progress of primary and secondary schools in various places is very slow, especially in the counties along the Chengdu-Chongqing Road. The salaries of elementary school teachers have been increased considerably, but they still feel that life is difficult. Currently, the 3rd, 10th, 7th, and 11th districts plan to provide all teachers in central and national schools with 3 shi dou of rice per month in addition to their prescribed salaries starting from the next semester. Civil servants below the township level will also receive the same treatment. A few counties have already started implementing it. If other places can follow suit, the salary problem of elementary school teachers and low-level civil servants can be easily solved. Among the counties' secondary schools, except for girls' schools and a few public and private secondary schools that are better, the rest should strive to enrich and improve. After a short rest, Hu and Guo will go to various counties in western Sichuan to inspect.

Training 17,000 Teachers

In order to implement the new county system and promote national education, the counties of Sichuan Province will set up short-term Bao National School Teacher Training Classes starting from July 1 to rush to train national education teachers. The training period is two months of summer vacation, from July 1 to August 31, and one month of winter vacation, with different dates. Each class has about 100 people. The first phase of the training will involve more than 17,000 teachers throughout Sichuan, with a total of 170 classes. The cost of each class is 4,000 yuan, totaling 680,000 yuan, which will be paid by the province. The selection of trainees is based on selecting the best from among private school teachers and intellectuals in various counties. The county head兼任s as the head of the short-term class, and the principal of the county normal school or other secondary school principal, or the section chief or superintendent of the county government serves as the deputy head. In addition to免收免收免收 all fees, students are also provided with subsidies. The training subjects include spiritual training, an overview of national education, administration of central national schools, an overview of local autonomy, teaching materials and methods for national language, arithmetic, music, physical education, labor, art, and other teaching materials and methods. After the training is completed, they will be assigned to various places to open national schools. If there are not enough people, it is planned to supplement them with teachers who have teacher qualifications or normal students and teachers from the war zone who have come to Sichuan.

### Finance: Chinese and Western Merchants Compete to Sell, Foreign Exchange Returns to Long Positions as Soon as It Tightens

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listing.

The US dollar once reached 6.25 yuan, and the British gold also reached three pence, nine three seven five. The afternoon closing was quite stable, and the market was quiet afterward.

Yesterday's exchange draft discount rate declined again. In the morning, each thousand yuan was discounted at 49 yuan, and the discount was issued at 51 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to retreat to 50 yuan, with the discount at 48 yuan, a small return of two yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank interest rate of the Qian Industry Association did not change, and both the morning and afternoon markets were listed at 18 points.

### The Gold Market Hesitates

Yesterday's cash bullion black market situation, although the trend was volatile, the scope was narrow and not very exciting. Operators' goals differed, and entries and exits were chaotic, rising and falling with the tightness and looseness of the exchange market. The foreign exchange was initially soft in the morning, and the opening was quite good at 5,270 yuan. Soon, gold and silver firms and securities firms fiercely stuffed, falling by about 100 yuan. However, money exchange firms took advantage of the cheapness and absorbed, and then rose to 5,260 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange firm vigorously sold, lowering the price by several tens of yuan. The afternoon closing was still announced at 5,230 yuan. Later, trading turned sparse, and the market was also flat, initially at 5,230 yuan. After the securities firm purchased some, it pulled to 5,245 yuan. The evening closing was announced at 5,240 yuan, only falling by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The total trading volume was about 2,000 taels. Silver building jewelry first fell and then rose, and as a result, there was no difference in honor or disgrace. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Bullion Fell by Ten Yuan

Since the beginning of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, the market was stable due to the slightly tighter foreign exchange. The opening was raised by 20 yuan, and the silver firm issued gold firm twenty taels, for 5,270 yuan. Subsequently, the market was soft due to the easing of foreign exchange, which caused a selling trend. Securities firms and gold firms sold jointly, and soon silver firms also followed suit, and it was actually spat out to within 5,200 yuan. Silver firms mutually made ten taels, inferior to 5,170 yuan. Fortunately, a certain money exchange firm took advantage of the cheapness and absorbed, so it was able to return to the 5,200 yuan mark. Although a certain money exchange firm then profited and spat out, Nes held that foreign exchange reported softly, and the retail appetite was surprisingly strong. In addition, gold firms frequently bought, so it rose by several tens of yuan again. The gold firm entered the securities firm ten taels, rising to 5,260 yuan. The buying trend was slightly frustrated at noon, and the silver firm helped a certain money exchange firm to throw out a number, and then pressed down a small 30-40 yuan. The gold firm issued the silver firm ten taels, retreating to 5,225 yuan. Subsequently, the gold firm entered the silver firm thirty taels, for 5,230 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the silver firm issued the gold firm ten taels, still for 5,230 yuan. Subsequently, the securities firm suddenly became interested in buying, and at that time a certain silver building also had a catch, and soon stepped up 15 yuan. The gold firm issued the silver firm twenty taels, for 5,245 yuan. Although a certain money exchange firm also came to absorb after entering, a certain gold firm had a strong intention to supply, and was finally pressed back five yuan. The gold firm issued the money exchange firm fifty taels, for 5,240 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day, and the whole day rose and fell by 100 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold firm's capital spleen gold was more than ten yuan higher than the bullion, and the buying was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry First Small then Large

At the beginning of the sale of gold jewelry per tael, Da Tonghang still suspended 540 yuan. At half past ten, it hung a small ten yuan, and at a quarter past eleven it returned to a high of ten yuan. There were no changes after this. It is estimated that Da Tonghang still suspended 540 yuan, and Xin Tonghang was similar to the above price, reducing the purchase by about 30 yuan.

### Silk and Tea Silk prices are unfair The silk sold to Japanese merchants is much cheaper than that sold to British and French merchants

Yesterday's silk market was stable. Yokohama spot prices remained unchanged, and forward prices rose by 13 yuan. New York spot prices opened at the original price, with the near term rising by two cents and the far term rising by two and a half cents. Silk prices in this port were not very uniform. White factory seven or eight points, Japanese merchant foreign firms entered at 4370 yuan, and British and French foreign firms entered at 4700 yuan. The difference between the two was 330 yuan. The former was mostly impounded goods, so manufacturers could only endure the pain of delivery. The entry price of British and French foreign firms was a normal transaction. The comparison of the two prices before and after has fully proved that the future of China's silk industry is hopeless.

Four hundred pieces of tea will be shipped to Tianjin today.

### Securities: More Domestic Debt Floats on the Market

Yesterday's unofficial market conditions for unified government bonds were such that news from all parties was silent, and the surrounding situation seemed chaotic again. After several days of soaring prices, the prices of various bonds had risen to a peak, and the general floating short positions were profitable, so many people sold one after another, but the demand of large households was not as eager as in the previous few days, and most of them carefully selected purchases, so speculators took the opportunity to be active and sold in large quantities, so that the market atmosphere was tired and declined. When it opened in the morning, the trend was still firm because Xinfu Hongda No. 64 Gongmao and others were quite interested, but Tongkang Jiufeng Dafeng Shengyu Xing Datong and others came out one after another to sell, so the market state lacked the strength to stabilize, and then gradually fell. The situation in the afternoon was still not strong, and there were more sellers on the counter, so Defu Hongda Taifeng Tongyu continued to spit out, and only Jiufeng Lianyi Sheng Darunli slightly purchased, but the market was quiet and not as prosperous as in the morning. The result was roughly closing at the lowest price, with a drop of one jiao to four jiao, etc. compared to the previous day. The turnover decreased sharply, only about one million yuan.

Stock Trading Hanyang Iron and Steel stocks, 100 shares were traded, and the price was 3.9 jiao.

London, 17th (Wednesday) Electric: Today's listed market prices of British companies' stocks in the Far East, bank stocks continued to rise. Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China shares rose five shillings, to six pounds five shillings. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's English registered shares rose one pound to sixty-six pounds, and the Hong Kong registered shares remained unchanged. However, Kulak-Lim Pung Rubber shares continued to fall by seven and a half pence, and it was thirteen shillings and nine pence. The rest were unchanged.

London, 17th (Wednesday) Electric: Today's Chinese foreign debt listed market prices remained stable.

There were no changes in government bonds with upper and lower limits.

### Yarn and Cotton: Retail Sales are Fragmented; the Yarn Market is Quiet

The yarn market is calm, and the overall trend remains in a state of hovering. This is because after the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian were blocked, transportation in eastern Zhejiang was completely suspended, and the sales of yarn were greatly affected. However, shipments to Hong Kong in South China were difficult, and they are now being changed to small ports to be transferred to the interior, so Hong Kong traders have made some fragmented purchases. People's minds are stable, and the bulls are not in a hurry to close, and the market is even quieter.

The opening of the current yarn market in the morning was lackluster due to the weakness of the overseas cotton market and the lack of significant changes in foreign exchange rates. 20-count Double Horse opened at a small price of 935 yuan, a drop of five or six yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, it fell slightly to 932 yuan, hovering at the price of 35-36 yuan for a long time. Later, it was heard that Hong Kong traders' actual sales were slightly more active, which was more active than the previous day, and the buying sentiment was strong, gradually rising to 948 yuan. The market recovered and fell back at the close. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,810 bales were traded, and the 20-count Double Horse price rose by 3 yuan. 180 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each trader is listed below:

Trader 1.30 Hong Kong 470 Total 1.810

Xiamen 25 Mainland 105

### Two Spot Cotton Transactions

Spot cotton transactions still have sporadic transactions, which are just embellishments from all parties. Indian cotton, which had risen for two consecutive days, fell back, which affected people's minds again. At the same time, the yarn market was also mediocre, and only traders had two transactions. The price of fire engine grass bales was 151 yuan, and traders entered 150 bales. Another 150 yuan, traders entered 200 bales, all of which were delivered at the stack.

In other news, overseas cotton prices in the New York cotton market initially fell due to the closing of long positions and the selling of the public, and later due to the weakness of Wall Street. As a result, the closing prices in the near term rose by 17 and 27 pound notes, and the far term fell by seven or eight pound notes. Indian yesterday opened a forecast drop of seven or eight rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market has been quite lively in recent days. Factory stocks are thin, and buying intentions are strong, but because yarn prices have not soared, there have only been continuous slight purchases. Therefore, it is generally expected that raw cotton will be in short supply in the future, and will be more promising.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Sales are Narrow; White Goods Sales Prices Decline

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, the market continued to be weak because sales were too narrow, and囤户's buying intention was sluggish, and sales prices gradually declined. The price of each piece of white goods, coarse and fine twill, fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao again. Dyed cloth had little ups and downs. The demand in various parts of Suzhou and Zhejiang was relatively strong, so the wholesale transactions in this street were quite prosperous. The number of transactions was about 300 pieces of cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders purchased more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, twill, etc. Yantai traders in the north purchased more than 100 pieces of twill velvet colored cloth, colored twill, etc.

Eastern Cloth: The market was stable, but Longtou fine cloth increased stack rent, and there was a distinction between new and old stack receipts. The new stack receipts once rose to 29.7 yuan at the morning opening, and 29.6 yuan at the close. The old stack receipts hovered between 28.8 and 9 jiao. Four Gentlemen serge was 8.625 to 625 jiao per yard, and the sales of middle-grade fine cloth and fine twill were still sluggish, and there were few sales.

Exports: Four hundred pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Yantai today, and another 110 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Gauze Trading is Dull

Gauze is used for mosquito nets in summer, and it is currently in the peak sales season, but current market transactions are limited, because most of them are directly ordered by carpentry and foreign goods traders. It is found that only a few nihong stores sell it, such as Yikang, Xinfeng, and Hefeng. The average wholesale price is about 5 yuan per yard. Ruikang Tianyuhua old-brand gauze is only sold by western-style carpentry shops such as Taichang Mao and Quantai.

1,200 pieces of cotton cloth will be exported to Yantai today, and another 48 pieces will be exported to Hong Kong.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Decreases Again; 20,000 Bags of Newly Arrived Foreign Rice

The rice market has been selling well since prices fell sharply in the previous dynasty, and then suddenly rebounded. Yesterday, the surge of foreign rice in large quantities and the heavy silver capital and other problems caused another violent decline. When the market opened early in the morning, the general inland rural clients and the appetite of the shops in this street were still hoping for good, and there were still many people who wanted to start purchasing first, so the market was quite firm and there was no change. No. 1 Chen Saigon still opened at 56.5 yuan, No. 2 at 53.5 yuan, Fire Mark at 55.5 yuan, and Small Jiao at 54.5 jiao. But later, it was expected that customers and vendors would have more hand goods, and they urgently needed flexible silver capital. Taking advantage of this tight file, they suddenly poured out a large number of spot goods. For a time, the market was flooded with goods. The general guests felt caught between a rock and a hard place, and they were dumbfounded and helpless. They stopped buying, so the overall situation was only out and not in. Although it was supported by buyers, it was eventually unable to last, and the market prices of various foreign rice fell section by section. By the close of the market, the price had fallen by about 2 yuan compared to the previous closing price. It is estimated that No. 1 Chen Saigon was only 55 yuan, No. 2 was 52.5 yuan, 52 yuan, No. 1 Siam was 55 yuan, No. 2 was 52 yuan, 51.5 yuan, Fire Jiao was 54 yuan, Hong Kong Tip was 53.5 yuan, and then to 50 yuan, Small Jiao was 53 yuan, Tokyo Tip was 48.5 yuan, and then to 46.5 yuan, Coarse Tip was 44-5 yuan, Cui Tip was 41.5 yuan, and then to 39 yuan, Mi Lu was 43.5 yuan, 42.5 yuan, and the price of Lu goods loaded on June 26 was still 62.5 yuan in the early market, and then from 62.2 jiao, it decreased to 61 yuan, and compared to the 63.5 yuan on the previous day, it was a decrease of 2.5 yuan, and the price of 20th loaded rice initially opened at 62.2 jiao, and then from 61.7 jiao and 61.6 jiao, it decreased to 61.2 jiao, which was also 2 yuan less than the price of 63.5 yuan on the previous day. The situation was still weak, and the market was not easy to stand up.

Foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Taigu Company's Taiyuan wheel arrived in Shanghai at noon, with 19,721 bags of foreign rice loaded from Hong Kong. It was docked at the company's pier on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading.

Although the sales of glutinous rice are not smooth, there are not many goods on the market, so it can stand up better, with only a rise and fall of 3-4 jiao. It is estimated that Jin Li Te Yuan opened at 63.2 jiao, 62.7 jiao, and Chang Dan Bai Yuan at about 61 yuan. However, Hong Kong foreign glutinous rice is different from domestic goods. Only foreign rice is the leader, so the market line is based on the situation, and it only opened at 60 yuan and 59 yuan.

There are still more than 1,000 bags of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica arriving, and the off-site black market transactions are said to be still sparse. The owners are not easy to transport, and they are still persisting for their own benefit. The purchase price of high-quality goods has only been slightly reduced by half a yuan. The price of secondary goods seems to have depreciated more heavily. Changbang Te Qing Japonica is 66-7 yuan, Kun Chang Su Bai Japonica is high from 65-6 yuan, and the secondary goods are 60 yuan. Qing Si Thin Rice is 65-6 yuan, and the secondary goods are 62-3 yuan. Nanhai Early Rice is 61 yuan, 60 yuan, and the bushel is 57-8 yuan.

### The Price of Wheat is Very Different Across the River A Difference of One Yuan and Several 角

Yesterday's flour was weak and sluggish, because sales streets needed it, and it retreated as soon as it moved. The customers, such as those in North China, were affected by the dumping of foreign flour, and there was no hope of development. Since domestic flour can be supplied to Shanghai from source, it is sold at the same time as Japanese factory flour, so the market is weak. The unified market only opened more than 1,000 bags of August Phoenix Flour, and the price was 15 yuan, which was another jiao less than before. The prices of other domestic miscellaneous brand flour also eased in secret. However, the raw materials of China Factory flour are strictly controlled and not easy to purchase, so the factory price is still the original price of 16 yuan. About 7-8,000 bags were wholesaled by the two factories.

Yesterday's wheat transactions were quiet, but the arrival in Hongkou was still strong. It was heard that the purchase price of China Factory was 23.3-4 jiao, and the purchase price of Japanese Factory was only about 22 yuan, with a difference of one yuan and several jiao across the river.

### Coal: Small Pieces of Current Goods are Flooded

Hongji No. 1 Small Pieces, due to the shortage of goods on the market last week, had called for a high price of 218 yuan. Recently, 屯户, in view of the decline in lump coal, also took advantage of the high price to get on the market, and the current goods suddenly flooded. The same industry from the car stack bill, each ton is 210 yuan, and there are also transactions. The shop in this street is still holding the original price because the cost of the old goods is high.

### Seafood: Pepper Arrival and Sales are Balanced

The arrival and sales of pepper have been balanced recently. The market for black pepper has been slightly frustrated. It is found that the previous market price of black big pepper and No. 1 pepper was the same at 106 yuan, and it has now dropped to 103 yuan. The trading is still possible. However, the bottom stock of white pepper is relatively thin, and it is quite firm. For example, the price of Wen Island goods is 202 yuan, and the price of Dutch goods is 190 yuan.

### Oil Cakes: Bean Cakes Still Rise Due to Rain; Raw Oil Sales Stagnate and Prices Fall

Raw Oil: Recently, the oil market has been blocked except for the iron bucket oil from Dalian that is allowed to pass. Relying only on the few movements of the gardens and workshops in this street, the trend has become increasingly unfavorable, and the market price has fallen step by step. Yesterday, only peanut oil was traded by Muji Street, with 100 pieces of Jiaozhou current oil and 1,000 pieces of road goods, and the prices were all 57 yuan. 100 pieces of Yantai oil were also priced at 57 yuan, 60 barrels of Qingdao oil were priced at 86.5 yuan, and 30 barrels of Tianjin oil were priced at 81 yuan. The market prices have fallen by 2-3 yuan across the board. In addition, 1,295 listens of raw oil will be shipped to Hong Kong today.

Bean Cake: The potential still shifts according to the weather. It rained overnight, and it cleared up this morning, so people's hearts were excited again, and market prices continued to increase by 2-3 jiao. The purchases were still made by various traders in South China and inland, and a total of 7,000 pieces of Dayou Four Brand Cake were traded, and the price is detailed in the market price column. 4,000 pieces of Shengji Cake, two cars of Feizi Cake, two cars of Yuanlong Cake, and 1,000 pieces of Qingzhong Cake.

Miscellaneous Grains: 650 bags of beans and 370 bags of raw kernels will be exported to Hong Kong today.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Rebounds

Yesterday's sugar market rebounded slightly due to the tightening of foreign exchange. The association divided the market, and the spot price of 24 coarse white goods in the stack was 67 yuan to 67.5 yuan, up 5 jiao. The external stack was 66.7 yuan to 67 yuan in the morning and 67.2 yuan to 4 jiao in the afternoon, up 8 jiao. Transit goods were cheaper. The price of goods delivered on the 22nd was 52.5 yuan to 52.8 jiao. The price of Taikoo Che Bai B Mark in the West stack was 76 yuan to 76.3 jiao, and the price of the East stack was 75.2 jiao to 76 yuan, up 3-5 jiao. Dutch red was 58 yuan, the factory's snow white was 67.5 yuan, the factory's No. 1 ice was 88.5 yuan, and Jingming ice was 90 yuan. In addition, 1,065 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Hardware: Bamboo Section Steel Bars Fall Frequently

Since the traders from other places reduced their purchases sharply, and the number of purchases made by the building traders in this street was also small, the market was quite sluggish, and people's hearts also turned soft. The standard market price initially fell from 1,400 yuan to 1,300 yuan, and then to 1,250 yuan. It was found that the shouting price of the market yesterday was only 1,200 yuan per ton (this is a 24-point pattern), and the coarse goods of 5 points to 1 inch also fell from 1,350 yuan to 1,250 yuan, and then to 1,200 yuan. It was heard that the market price yesterday was only 1,150 yuan per ton, which was a drop of 50 yuan compared to before, and the transactions were still sporadic.

### The Factory's Round Nails Also Decline Together

The market for the factory's round nails, which had been sluggish for a long time, has still not improved recently. The widest sales areas in the South Seas Islands and Hong Kong have been closed, and the traders in the ports of North China and the traders in the Yangtze River, Ningbo, and Fujian have no time to absorb them, so the market is quite depressed and people's hearts are also declining. Therefore, sales prices are also calm and lifeless, and the shouting price yesterday was 45-6 yuan, and the transactions were only with building traders and sporadic.

### Excerpts from Old Newspapers: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (449) (From a Copy of the Shenbao Newspaper of the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)

A Fortuitous Coincidence

A man named Jia from Tianchang was betrothed to a woman from the same village, surnamed Mou. Due to poverty, he could not settle down to farming and became a soldier in a certain military camp. Later, he became a household servant for a certain committee member. Over ten years passed without news. His fiancée's family, unable to wait any longer, married her off to a man named Yi. When Jia learned of this, he devised a plan: He pretended to be a household servant from the county government, dispatched to Tianchang County to deliver official documents. He took the opportunity to go home briefly, acting as if he was in a hurry and couldn't stay long. He anticipated that his fiancée's family, seeing him still alive and working for the county government, would be afraid and ask someone to intercede. With his plan set, he dressed accordingly and set off. Upon arriving home, he stayed for one night and then prepared to return to the county to deliver the documents. His fiancée's family, seeing him still alive and an official follower, was indeed very frightened! They immediately asked village elders to persuade Jia to stay. Jia refused, but they pleaded with him repeatedly until he finally agreed. The elders prepared wine and food to entertain Jia, being very solicitous. While drinking, Jia deliberately spoke boastfully. Before long, one of the elders raised his cup to Jia and said, "Please finish this cup, as I have something to tell you." Jia accepted and drank it dry. The elder said, "Today's gathering is actually hosted by your fiancée's father. He then recounted the entire story of the other marriage to Jia, explaining that the fiancée's father had acted rashly and regretted it immensely. However, since the matter had already reached this point, there was no turning back. They now proposed to find another wife for Jia, namely Yi's younger sister, who was just reaching marriageable age and was more beautiful than the previous fiancée. If Jia agreed, they would arrange the wedding that very evening. All the betrothal gifts and wedding expenses would be covered by the former fiancée's father, without Jia having to spend a single penny." Jia was overjoyed and agreed to the proposal.

### No Salvation Apart From Jesus

Peter, in the name of the Lord Jesus, commanded a lame man to rise and walk, and he entered the temple with him, matching the true God. There are many people in the world today who are lame and need a helping hand to lift them up to worship and praise God. Peter did this, and he was questioned by the local officials. He attributed the glory to the Lord Jesus, saying, "This man stands before you healed because of the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead." He also said, "There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."

There is no name in heaven or on earth greater than the name of Jesus. He is God and also man, overcoming nature and death, such as feeding five thousand people with five loaves of bread and two fish, calming the wind and waves, and rising from the dead. Once, a Muslim said to a Christian, "Our Muslim religion is much better than Christianity." The Christian asked him, "Why?" He said, "We went to the city of Mecca and found the dead bones of our leader to commemorate; you Christians went to Jerusalem, but you cannot find the dead bones of your leader Jesus to commemorate." The Christian replied, "Yes, you can find the bones of your leader because he is dead. We cannot find the bones of our leader because he is alive. He rose from the tomb on the third day, ascended to heaven, and intercedes for believers at the right hand of God." The leaders of all the world's religions have flaws, but Jesus has no flaws, no sins. Dr. R. E. Lea said that Jesus is an artist, a scientist, a botanist, a geologist, a historian, an optician, a worker, a farmer, and in short, He is a complete savior. Do you believe in such a complete savior?

When a person sins, there is no other medicine that can heal, only Jesus Christ can save. There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.

### The Reason for Robbery

— Nai Liu

Passing by a small vegetable market, a group of people blocked my way. There was a commotion, and I didn't know what had happened.

At the center of the group was a woman, standing blankly with a basket of vegetables in her left hand. An old man beside her was advising her, "Go buy your vegetables, he won't return it to you!"

I was confused. As the crowd gradually dispersed, the old man who had been comforting the woman seemed to be deeply moved, so he spoke to one person after another. When he approached me, I impatiently asked him:

"What's wrong? What happened to this woman?"

"Robbed of her ring." The old man replied simply, then added a detailed explanation: "That woman was wearing a gold ring to buy vegetables, but it was still early, and not many vegetable vendors had arrived. At that moment, two robbers came and snatched the ring from her hand. They even lectured her, saying, 'Now people are starving and have no food to eat, yet you still wear a gold ring?' After saying that, they took the ring and left."

I listened attentively, thinking, "Now people are starving and have no food to eat, yet you still wear a gold ring." This is probably the "reason" for the robbery! I wonder what the woman who was robbed would say in response to this "reason"? I suppose she couldn't say anything.

(Editor's Note: Robbery is illegal, so this "reason" is naturally invalid. But the fact that many people are starving is a fact, and the fact that some people hoard gold bars is also a fact.)

### "The Five Ghosts Moving Treasures"

— Guo Qiang

Dear Editor,

Please forgive my intrusion. I ask that you publish my following experience of being scammed in a corner of your esteemed publication, so that those in Shanghai who are as curious as I am will not suffer the same fate.

On the evening of ××, as I was passing through ×× Road, I happened to see a crowd of people of all ages standing around. In the middle was a "magic master" of some sort. A captivating magic picture was hanging on the wall. I asked this master to teach me the "Five Ghosts Moving Treasures" method, paying him two dimes. He then led me to a secluded place and said, "'Five Ghosts Moving Treasures' is not a trick or a spell, but a kind of talisman magic. Therefore, it cannot be taught on the spot. You must record your age and birthday, which he will process overnight. At ×× o'clock the next day, I could learn at the same place, but I could not discuss this matter with any friends that night." The next day, I went to × Road at the appointed time, and the master was already waiting. He began his deceptive and captivating performance (burning talismans and chanting spells). Then he said, "This Five Ghosts divine talisman is not a true god, so it must be wrapped together with five materials: gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin. Then you can take it home and hide it in a box. After an hour, you can take it out and perform the magic." However, I didn't have any gold or silver with me, so I discussed it with him. The result was that he said five yuan in legal tender would also work. I took out the five yuan from my pocket and put it in a matchbox with the talisman, wrapped it in leather paper, tied it with red silk, and handed it to him. At this time, my attention was entirely focused on the five yuan in legal tender. However, he hid the matchbox behind my back, on my waistband, and chanted, "I invite ××, I invite ××, I invite ××, ××× command to the west," reciting each line once. At the same time, he replaced the matchbox on my waist with a pre-prepared box that looked the same (pretending to secure it for me). At that moment, I mustered my courage, snatched back the box in his pocket, and hurried away. It is said that there are many people doing this kind of thing, please be careful.

Mr. Guo Qiang: If you had paid a little attention to the newspapers, you would have known this was a scam long ago. You say "there are many people doing this kind of thing," precisely because there are so many easily scammed people like you. But please forgive me, I am not blaming you for "being scammed," but for the reason you were scammed—curiosity contains an element of darkness. Let me ask you: Why didn't you learn "Flying Bird Cage" or "Flying Cards," but instead wanted to learn "Five Ghosts Moving Treasures"? Please answer me honestly, did you want to rely on this "magic" to obtain something unexpected? If so, then I advise you, such a brilliant "magic" would be kept secret for fear of being discovered, how could it be shared with everyone for the mere price of two dimes? Apart from ill-gotten gains, every penny earned requires considerable work, just as the five yuan in legal tender you were not scammed out of was not easily earned.

### The Value of Stamps

— Xin Fang

Before the Central Bank issued fractional currency, there was a time when stamps were used in the market to replace copper coins because of the shortage of copper coins. You said broken stamps were worthless, and I said soaked stamps were worthless. The value of stamps was reduced, and one yuan in legal tender could be exchanged for 110 to 120 cents!

Now, stamps have been listed by some stores as something that can be profited from. Yesterday, I went to a tobacco and paper shop near me to buy a two-cent stamp because I wanted to send a letter. The shop assistant wanted three cents from me, and it was the same at another shop. Not long ago, the situation before and after was so different that I couldn't help but sigh!

### Medicine Residue

— Written by: Cao Jian

In the alley, I often find piles of Chinese medicine residue. At first, I found it very strange. Why do people dump medicine residue in the middle of the road? Is there no trash can? If the trash can is placed far away, and they dump it on the ground out of laziness, then that would be a reason. Strangely, the place where the medicine residue is dumped is only a few steps away from the trash can. So why must the medicine residue be dumped in the middle of the road instead of in the trash can? This question has become an unsolvable mystery in my mind.

Once, when I was walking in the alley, I happened to see someone dumping medicine residue on the ground. I said to him, "Please dump the medicine residue in the trash can in the future, don't make the road so dirty." But as a result, I was met with his contempt and he scolded me a few times, telling me to mind my own business.

Later, I accidentally talked about this matter with a friend. He said to me, "This is Chinese superstition. They believe that if the medicine residue is dumped in the middle of the road, and pedestrians step on it, they will get the disease of the patient in their home, and the patient in their home will get better." I couldn't help but laugh when I heard my friend's words. Every day, countless people step on medicine residue, will the patient really get better like this? Will the person who steps on the medicine residue really get sick?

We must know that if we don't want to be invaded by disease, maintain a healthy body, and enjoy a happy life, then in addition to working hard to maintain our health, we must all strive to abide by public hygiene. Only if we all strive to focus on public hygiene is that a truly healthy path!

### Shu Ping is Not Small

To whom it may concern, I recently read the news about scholarships for poor students in various newspapers, and the details were very detailed, which shows that the society is enthusiastic about cultivating poor children and has a lot of sympathy. At a time when life is expensive, it is not easy for poor children to aspire to study. In view of this, this office has launched the Gu Shu Ping Memorial Scholarship for junior and senior high schools since the spring of this year. The purpose is, on the one hand, to commemorate Mr. Gu Shu Ping's lifelong enthusiasm for charity and his untiring efforts to promote education; and on the other hand, to consider the difficulty of studying for poor and studious children, and to allocate funds to promote it. All poor high school students in the port, who are of exceptional character and academic performance, and who aspire to study but are not allowed by their family circumstances; or those who have dropped out of school, with proof from a formal school, and attaching a report card from the last semester or the previous semester, with a total average of 85 points or more, and detailed resume, the name and occupation of the parents, and family situation, and a recent half-length photo, send it to this office by registered mail for registration. After the investigation by this office, if the family circumstances are indeed poor and unable to afford tuition fees, then the examination will be conducted by this office. Once admitted, the student may study at the original school or choose a formal school in the port, and the tuition fees will be borne by this office, and the cost of books will be subsidized by this office according to the situation; the funds will be paid directly by this office, and no cash will be paid to the students, in order to be properly managed. In the spring of this year, the first phase of scholarship students admitted by this office totaled 42 people. In the last semester, the academic performance of each student was excellent, and the total average score of the school examination was mostly above 85 points, and even above 95 points. In order to encourage the first phase of scholarship students to study hard, this office will continue to provide scholarships to those whose academic performance is above 85 points and whose family circumstances are still unable to afford tuition fees. The second phase of scholarship examination has already begun, and the registration will be closed at the end of this month. There are already dozens of people who have registered. It is hoped that the details of the scholarship organized by this office will be revealed and introduced, so that poor and excellent children can obtain more opportunities to study.

Hawthorne's Detective Cases

### The Homecoming After the Dance

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Three: Opposing Intelligence

The woman didn't say a word, turned around and walked towards the stairs. Old Mao seemed to have some scruples, so he also walked towards the door of the room, saying to Ni Jinshou with a smile.

"Detective, I've finished my words, I'm going to the gatehouse."

Hawthorne suddenly waved his hand to stop him. "Wait, I still have something to ask you."

The doorman had to stop and turn around. Hawthorne sat down again and thought of his cigarette. He took out his cigarette case while speaking calmly.

"Old Mao, there are also things about yourself that you haven't told us."

Old Mao stuck out his tongue to lick his lips, his rat eyes changed repeatedly, then his eyes focused on Hawthorne's face, as if he couldn't understand the meaning of Hawthorne's words for a moment.

He asked back, "About me? What do you mean? Could it be that—could it be that I killed him?"

Hawthorne lit the cigarette, took a breath, and slowly replied, "That's not what I mean. What we want to ask is your actions last night and what you heard and saw."

The old man seemed to realize something and nodded, saying, "Of course. I was going to tell you. The things last night were also very strange—"

Hawthorne suddenly interrupted him, "Strange or not, you should be slow to judge. You should tell us your actions in order."

"Let's start with dinner."

"Okay, I had dinner outside last night."

"Where?"

"Zhengxing Restaurant—a small restaurant on Hankou Road."

"How many people?"

"Just me—sir, why are you asking so carefully? Don't you really suspect me—" (49)

Entertainment

### Kim Hyeseu's Thirteenth Birthday

— New Film

Kim Hyeseu, this famous child star, recently starred in the 20th Century Fox film "High School," achieving outstanding results. Time flies quickly, and she is already thirteen years old this year, and her child star era is about to pass. Here are some words about her successful experience and the grand occasion of her thirteenth birthday:

Birthday Celebration

She went on the screen at a very young age, and now she is thirteen years old. This little girl is very likable both on and off the screen. Recently, when she held a thirteenth birthday celebration at home, people from the film industry came to congratulate her, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. One point that can be particularly mentioned is that she invited five children from outside the film circle to her home to participate in the grand event that day, and because of this invitation, these five children also went on the screen when 20th Century Fox filmed "High School," playing Kim Hyeseu's classmates.

Standard Movie Fan

Because every film she stars in is quite successful, the audience off-screen expresses their love for her. Usually, many movie fans also write letters to her constantly. Kim Hyeseu herself is not only a small star, but also a standard movie fan. When new films are released in Hollywood cinemas, she always takes the time to see them once. As long as she is not filming, most of her free time is spent in the cinema.

Good at Photography

Although she is only thirteen years old, she can also take photographs. She often carries an eight-inch quick-shot camera in her hand. When the company goes outside to shoot location scenes, she takes her camera and takes pictures of the scenery everywhere. When she comes back, she can always take a lot of photos, and the results are quite good. So some people say that Kim Hyeseu is also a female photographer!

Raising Animals

Kim Hyeseu's home has a lot of animals, from monkeys to chickens, she raises everything. She usually takes great care of them, and even feeds them herself. Toys, mechanical, clay, she has everything, and I don't know how many foreign dolls she has. She likes to read history books, and about saws, hammers, knives, and all kinds of nails, Kim Hyeseu has them all. She can make toys such as stools, building blocks, and small houses.

### After Watching "Under the Eaves of Shanghai"

— Zhang Yuqing

This is a social drama written by Xia Yan for "Amateur" three years ago, and it is a super-special creation showing Shanghai. What the stage gives us is a one-story residential house, which is also the so-called "alley" house commonly seen in Shanghai. The people living in this house are of course cadres in the Shanghai social class. Because the social organization is unsound, there is also a single girl living a life of prostitution, a college student who is unemployed upon graduation, and a newspaper vendor who is huddled in the three-story attic who cannot lift his head. The story of the whole play unfolds in such an environment.

Judging from the achievements of the whole play, it can be said that it is really up to standard, but from my personal feelings after watching it, I think it is better for the co-faithful playwright to make a slight supplement to the mountain director, just like the college student Huang Jiamei living in the pavilion room, if his personality is changed to be more positive, then he will definitely be able to turn the exposure into an instruction, especially when the prostitute Shi Xiaobao on the front floor asks him to read the letter, he does not dare to resist her teasing. At the same time, it seems to be explained from this scene that her prostitution seems to be willingly indulging in depravity, not for the sake of life.

Another example is Zhao Zhenyu, a primary school teacher in the kitchen, whose attitude of going with the flow is also undesirable. His performance of adapting to the environment is precisely giving a great cover to the general people who lack hot blood. Needless to say, if he can explain to the newspaper vendor Li Lingbei the responsibility for the death of his son on the battlefield, I believe he will definitely be able to understand what the current war is for.

In the entire performance, the audience felt very satisfied. Especially worth mentioning is the device, yes, a whole house has never been seen on the Chinese stage before.

The actor who plays the primary school teacher, Su Dan, is the most qualified. Liu Daiyun is also good. Because Wan'er does not have the opportunity to act, so her acting skills cannot be seen. Bai Li's voice is a pity that it is too low. The rest are mediocre. Yan Jun's rogue is too lacking in strength, this may be less experience. It is worth not neglecting the little sister Shi Lingfang who plays Baozhen, she is indeed successful, and I wish this new artist to work hard.

### A Scene from "Sunny Day" - Nanjing Screening

### Twenty Kinds of Tanci (15) Describing the Golden Phoenix

— Written by Dong Yun, Illustrated by Xiu Yan

Ordinary tanci novels. The main characters are usually only two. For example, Fang Qing and Chen Cuie in The Pearl Pagoda, Tang Yin and Qiu Xiang in A Smiling Destiny, Zhou Xuewen and Lu Qingyun in Falling Golden Fan... There are countless examples like this.

But Describing the Golden Phoenix is an exception. The characters who appear on the stage, such as Xu Huilan, Jin Jichun, Qian Acui, Wang Xian, and Qian Duxiao, cannot be regarded as supporting roles in the book. The reason is that "Describing the Golden Phoenix" does not focus on narrow love between men and women. However, comparatively speaking, Xu Huilan and Qian Acui are the backbone of the book.

"Qian Duxiao Praying for Rain" is a famous section in Describing the Golden Phoenix—an interlude of jokes.

### A Chronicle of a Genius Artist in the Shanghai Opera Circle

— Dong Yun

Shanghai opera is a kind of folk opera. Although the literati class derogate it as the sound of the lower class, there is no doubt that it can match the taste of Shanghai people.

Miss Xiuying is the youngest red artist in today's Shanghai opera circle. Her achievements should be attributed to "genius." Now, in addition to performing at the Chang Le Theater day and night, she has four broadcasting programs every day, and almost all of her time is spent on the singing stage. She has grown into a likable appearance. When performing on the red carpet, she is naturally "vivid"; and when meeting in private, she feels even more "gorgeous." In terms of appearance, she can cover Wang Yaqin and make Shi Xiaoying lose face; in terms of art, her voice and tone, learning from Xiao Yuezhen can be confused with the real, and his future achievements are definitely not limited to Xiao Yuezhen.

What is especially worth mentioning is that Miss is extremely clever. She can learn the new drama "Drilling the Pot" as soon as she learns it; she can memorize unfamiliar lyrics after a little reading. Her expressions are meticulous, and when performing a tragedy, her tears are really crystal clear, and the people on the stage are almost integrated with the people in the play.

She is only nineteen years old this year, and her achievements are not easy to achieve.
