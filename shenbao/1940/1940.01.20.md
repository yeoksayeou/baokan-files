### A Review of the Foundation of China's Legal Tender

Last year, in the Shanghai black market, the British exchange rate once fell from over eight shillings to a mere three shillings, and the U.S. exchange rate fell from over fifteen yuan to a minimum of around six yuan. The surge was like the collapse of a raging tide, and people were panicked and at a loss. Consequently, those who doubted the credit of the legal tender resorted to unscrupulous means, without considering the consequences, focusing solely on evading funds. Moreover, there were many who took advantage of the opportunity to sabotage and reap the benefits. Furthermore, as the methods of "control" and extortion became tighter, the flames of speculation and hoarding flared up, leading to soaring prices, hardship for the people, and social instability. Some attributed this to the fall in currency value, inevitably leading to inflation, impossible to adjust, rampant price increases, impossible to stabilize, and rural decline, impossible to remedy. However, as evidenced by the facts, this is not only greatly mistaken, but the economic situation of China and Japan cannot be compared at all. This is not an exaggeration. The major changes in Shanghai's finance last year were initiated by a premeditated attempt to destroy China's entire financial structure, placing it in a position of eternal ruin, and achieving their ambition of dominating the situation temporarily. If Shanghai had not taken appropriate measures to deal with the rising exchange rate at that time, the foreign exchange reserve would inevitably have been swallowed up and consumed without remainder. Therefore, it was necessary for self-defense not to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange rate, allowing it to rise and fall freely, in order to preserve China's financial vitality. This is truly the so-called enduring momentary pain to plan for the long term. If the legal tender had indeed reached an irreparable state, its external exchange rate would inevitably decline like a river flowing downstream, with no possibility of return. However, a look at the foreign exchange trend last winter shows that it not only recovered at times but was also exceptionally stable, which is clear proof of the soundness of the legal tender itself.

Even in terms of the amount of paper money issued, Japan has a population of 98 million, and the amount of paper money issued at the end of last year reached 3.8 billion yuan. China has a population of 460 million, and the amount of legal tender in circulation at the end of last year was only 3 billion yuan. Comparing population to population, Japan's population is only 21% of China's population. Comparing the amount of paper money issued, Japan issued 26% more paper money than China. Furthermore, in terms of reserves, Japan's 3.8 billion yuan in banknotes, according to foreign reports, only has 500 million yuan in gold reserves, accounting for only 13.16%. China's 3 billion yuan in legal tender has 1.546 billion yuan in cash reserves, reaching 50.17%. Comparing this to that, the foundation of China's legal tender is as solid as iron, while the reserves for Japanese banknotes are indeed very fragile. This is not a deliberate advertisement for China's legal tender. Examining the trend of the amount of Chinese paper money issued further clarifies that the aforementioned statement is not false. The amount of Chinese legal tender issued one month before the Lugouqiao Incident (i.e., June of the 26th year of the Republic of China) was 1.4 billion yuan. By the same period the following year (June of the 27th year), i.e., one year after the outbreak of the war, it was 1.76 billion yuan. At the end of June last year (the 28th year), it was 2.62 billion yuan. The increase of 860 million yuan in this year seems quite large. By the end of last year, it had increased by another 460 million yuan, resulting in a total issuance of 3.08 billion yuan. However, when considering the actual situation, the increase cannot be said to be large. The currencies in the southwestern provinces have always been extremely chaotic, with hard currency and local paper money mixed together. Since the National Government moved west, they have gradually been reorganized to achieve unification (i.e., legal tender). Therefore, the sudden increase in the demand for legal tender is only natural. The evidence for this is also very clear. In the past, the Bank of China issued the most Chinese paper money, so even the Central Bank was somewhat inadequate. The Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank were even further behind. Until June of the year before last, the Bank of China's legal tender issuance was 650 million yuan, while the Central Bank still only had 490 million yuan. The trend had not yet changed. It was not until June of last year that the situation changed greatly. The Central Bank issued 1 billion yuan in paper money, while the Bank of China issued 700 million yuan. By the end of last year, the Central Bank had 1.34 billion yuan, while the Bank of China still only had 770 million yuan, exceeding the Bank of China by as much as 570 million yuan. This is probably because, due to historical reasons, the Bank of China has always been a financial giant in the southeast. With the outbreak of the war of resistance, the government and the people gradually moved inland. To meet the needs of the situation, the Central Bank naturally expanded its operations due to its position, and the issuance of banknotes naturally increased as well. Moreover, reorganizing the currency in the interior inevitably requires the recovery of a large amount of miscellaneous currencies, and what else can fill the gap but legal tender? Furthermore, due to restrictions on withdrawals and the impact of the war, there are many who hoard cash. To adapt to the needs of the local area, issuing a new portion of legal tender is also highly sought after by the citizens. This is the reason for the increase in paper money issuance. Given China's vast territory, large population, abundant resources, and diverse currencies, if legal tender can be fully implemented, the issuance of 3 billion yuan has not yet reached the saturation point. Moreover, this 3 billion yuan of legal tender still has a cash reserve of over 50%! Those who doubt the credit of legal tender can now be enlightened.

However, this credit cannot be achieved by luck. China's foreign trade has always been in a deficit position, but last year, even Shanghai, which consumes the most foreign goods, had a surplus. Is this not a great blessing? The recent balance of foreign exchange is also related to the decrease in import trade. Japan is not the same. Although it is also nominally in surplus, its foreign exchange trade, excluding the yen bloc trade, is still in deficit. Therefore, economic panic in their country is even worse than in China, which has suffered the destruction of war. Moreover, as the distribution center for Chinese native goods, Hong Kong's exports of Chinese goods through Hong Kong in the past eleven months were worth a total of 274 million Hong Kong dollars. The United States alone purchased 15 million U.S. dollars worth of tung oil last year. From this, it can be seen that the consolidation of China's legal tender is not without reason. Furthermore, as urban life is becoming increasingly difficult due to soaring prices, agricultural product prices are also rising at the same time, leading to a sudden increase in farmers' incomes, which is very different from normal times. Is it not today that we see "funds flowing to the countryside"? There are indeed things in the world that cannot be explained by conventional theories. Although the future is long, and the war has not yet ended, the current temporary favorable situation cannot be regarded as a final conclusion. However, based on past achievements and assessing future trends, we can hold an optimistic view without doubt.

### U.S. Senator Introduces Bill to Ban Export of Munitions and Raw Materials to Japan; Believes It is an Effective Action to Stop Aggression; The Public Opposes the Renewal of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce

Washington. U.S. Republican Senator Capper introduced a bill in the Senate yesterday to impose a ban on the export of munitions and raw materials to Japan. He said that he does not advocate war with Japan, but "I solemnly declare that we must stop supplying Japan with our country's munitions for the purpose of aggression against China." Capper also requested that a letter from a voter protesting the renewal of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce be entered into the congressional record. He said that he had received hundreds of similar letters. Capper cited statistics on U.S. supplies of munitions to Japan: in 1937, the U.S. supplied 54% of Japan's munitions; in 1938, it was 56%; and in 1939, it increased to 80%. If the United States completely stopped supplying munitions, Japan's aggression against China would have to stop. Capper also said, "I sympathize with the tens of thousands of people in our country who abhor Japan's aggression against China. Therefore, I advocate that we must stop selling munitions to Japan and other aggressor nations." Capper also stated that his attitude was completely consistent with his previous vote against the Neutrality Act. (19th United Press dispatch)

Washington. According to merchants and official sources here, after the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce, hundreds of Japanese merchants residing in the United States can continue to stay in the United States. As for new Japanese merchants arriving in the United States, they must be treated as tourists. Any new Japanese merchants arriving in the United States can only stay in the United States for two years, after which they must reapply; otherwise, they will be deported. The U.S. State Department made no comment on this matter. (19th United Press dispatch)

### Difficult to Break the Stalemate in Japanese Diplomacy; Pro-Soviet or Pro-American? Recognizing Psychological Difficulties

Tokyo. Japan's "Hochi Shimbun" criticized the intentions of Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita today, claiming that both the United States and the Soviet Union harbor suspicion and exert pressure on Japan, leading to an adverse situation in Japan's relations with the two countries. The newspaper declared, "U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew told former Japanese Foreign Minister Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura that the United States 'is extremely concerned about Japan's rapprochement with the Soviet Union.' This concern has led to unsatisfactory progress in U.S.-Japan commercial negotiations." The newspaper continued, "Conversely, the Soviet Union is also trying to prevent the adjustment of U.S.-Japan relations. It is undeniable that this attempt has affected the demarcation negotiations between 'Outer Mongolia' and 'Manchukuo' and the resolution of other pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union." "Hochi Shimbun" also claimed that Foreign Minister Arita believes that Japan can adjust its relations with the U.S. and the Soviet Union without conflict, and believes that Japan can adjust its relations with the Soviet Union within the scope of the Anti-Comintern Pact, without conflicting with the United States. (19th United Press dispatch)

Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Yakichiro Suma commented on the news published by "Hochi Shimbun" regarding negotiations between Japan and the United States and the Soviet Union, claiming, "There is no technical conflict in Japan holding simultaneous negotiations with the United States and the Soviet Union," but admitted that there are psychological difficulties. Suma claimed that the date of the meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew has not yet been decided, but it may be held before January 26 (the expiration date of the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce). (19th United Press dispatch)

Tokyo. The Foreign Ministry spokesman stated at a press conference today that Japanese-Soviet talks are fundamentally unrelated to the U.S.-Japan conference, and the related reports in the newspapers are inaccurate. In response to questions from foreign reporters, the spokesman claimed that Japan sincerely desires to maintain a "good neighbor policy" with all countries, including the U.S. and the Soviet Union. He hopes that several U.S.-Japan talks will be held in Tokyo and Washington before January 26 (the expiration date of the existing U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce). Foreign Minister Arita met with U.S. Ambassador Grew and diplomatic representatives from other countries yesterday, but this was a matter of courtesy, so Arita did not discuss anything with Grew.

### Japanese Cabinet Eagerly Seeks to Create a Puppet New Regime; Convening a Meeting of the Asia Development Board

Tokyo. Prime Minister Yonai stated clearly in his first statement after forming the cabinet on the 16th that the handling of the China Incident would be based on established policy, and that the purpose would continue to be to fully support the establishment and development of the "New Central Government" of China. Now that the Wang-Wang-Liang Qingdao meeting has decided to be held recently, the Japanese government authorities convened the first meeting of the new cabinet's Asia Development Board at the Prime Minister's official residence at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon. Those attending included Prime Minister Yonai, Minister of Finance, Minister of the Army, Minister of the Navy Yoshida, and Kawa Yanagawa, Director-General of the Asia Development Board, who had previously attended the liaison department meeting of the Asia Development Board in Nanjing. After listening to his report from the field in detail, they carefully discussed the policies for the Japanese side to support the new regime in the future. (19th Domei dispatch)

Tokyo. After the first cabinet meeting on the 16th, the new Japanese cabinet has held cabinet meetings every day, discussing measures to deal with the Diet, including the continuation of the Diet recess and the issue of parliamentary vice-ministers. As these issues have been resolved, a continuous cabinet meeting will be held for three days starting on the 22nd to conduct an important review of the new cabinet's internal and external policies. Prime Minister Yonai is working to establish the three principles of handling the incident, adjusting relations with third countries, and resolving domestic problems. The unwavering national policy has already been decided for (1) assisting in the establishment of the "New Central Government" of China, (2) adjusting diplomatic relations with the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, Germany, and (3) resolving wartime domestic economic problems. These issues are being carefully reviewed. In particular, issues that have been heavily discussed since the previous cabinet, such as the problem of the Ministry of Trade and the reform of the civil service system, are being considered from a new perspective. Once these important national policies are decided, they will be clarified in the policy speech by the Prime Minister, the financial speech by the Minister of Finance, and the diplomatic speech by the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the reopening of the Diet on February 1, to clarify the situation both domestically and abroad.

### American Newspaper Believes Japan is Eager for Peace; Military at a Loss

Washington. (Washington Evening Star) Regarding Wang Jingwei's telegram to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek seeking peace, it is tantamount to a confession by the Japanese side that it cannot resolve the China war. It is thinking of using other methods to achieve a face-saving peace. Furthermore, the Japanese troops currently in China are now in a dilemma, but the relations between Japan and the United States are extremely poor. If the United States implements an embargo on munitions and raw materials, Japan will collapse. Therefore, there are many reasons for the Yonai and Arita cabinets to seek peace, and the psychological desire for peace is also strong. Japan's desire to improve relations with the Soviet Union and Germany is also driven by its difficult situation. (16th United Press dispatch)

### United China Relief Donates More Than $50,000 Gold

New York. The United China Relief announced last night that as of January 15, it had raised US$55,203.16 in the "Rice Bowl Campaign." (19th United Press dispatch)

### Signs of Japan's Economic Difficulties Are Becoming Increasingly Evident; People's Livelihood is Difficult, and Anti-War Sentiment is Strong; Appealing to the Government to Devise Good Policies to Relieve the Suffering

New York. An editorial in today's "New York Times" stated that the economic difficulties Japan is experiencing due to the war against China are becoming increasingly severe and evident, and can no longer be concealed. The recent change of cabinet in Japan is not unrelated to the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and the failure to renew it, but it is also the result of Japan's increasingly severe economic difficulties, and one of the reasons is that the government's solutions to these difficulties have not been satisfactory. According to the "New York Times," prices in Japan have risen by 16% in the past six months, while the supply of various goods has also been decreasing. According to a Tokyo dispatch received by the "New York Times," a well-known Eastern economist said that as long as Japan continues its expansionist policies, shortages of goods and continued price increases are inevitable. The publication of this view was not only unheard of a year ago in Japan, but also never seen by the general public, but now it is openly expressed. From this, it can be seen how much economic hardship Japan is suffering. In other words, Japan's anti-war sentiment is rising. In short, the war against China has become a bottomless pit, and even if Japan pours as many soldiers and resources into it as possible, it will not be enough to fill it. This point seems to have been understood by the Japanese, but it is difficult to dismount from the tiger, and there is no way to save the situation." (19th United Press dispatch)

Tokyo. After the establishment of the Yonai Cabinet, various newspapers published commentaries on important issues in domestic and foreign affairs, asking how the new cabinet would respond. In general, the public expects the new cabinet to improve the people's livelihood and relieve the suffering of the people. For this reason, people from all over the country have written to the Prime Minister with various requests. The number of letters received at the Prime Minister's residence is piled up like a mountain. For example, a farmer in Aomori Prefecture in the north wrote, "Last year, we had a bumper harvest of oranges, but due to a lack of wooden boxes and nails, we were unable to pack and export them, and because they rotted over time, we had no choice but to endure the pain and not sell them, resulting in a huge loss. Please consider this." A villager in Nagoya City wrote, "As a result of the previous cabinet's controlled economy, we have to pay high prices to buy a small amount of feed needed for raising chickens, resulting in a sharp decline in income and great difficulties. Please amend the ban on the import of foreign feed so that we can buy sufficient feed at a lower price." A farmer in Niigata City wrote, "Last year's rice harvest was excellent, but most of it was purchased and transported out by the local authorities, and local farmers had to buy rice from other places." Retail merchants in Osaka City also wrote to the Prime Minister, expressing their deep dissatisfaction with the authorities' measures to control rice consumption, and said, "We really don't know what the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry is doing. We would rather distribute rice ourselves to regulate the market." People from Morioka Prefecture wrote, "The controlled economy measures implemented by the previous cabinet, especially the measures to increase coal production, have completely failed and have caused a coal shortage. We hope that the new government can correct this." In addition, lumber merchants in Akita Prefecture, wool weavers in Fukui Prefecture, porcelain merchants in Kanazawa Prefecture, silk merchants in Yokohama, match merchants in Kobe, iron smelters in Moji, coal miners in Fukuoka, and other people from all over the country have written to criticize the previous cabinet and request relief from the new cabinet in countless ways.

### A Clever Wife Cannot Cook Without Rice: The Cabinet's Fate Can Be Foreseen, Causing Panic Among Japanese Superstitious Believers; Army Newspaper's Straightforward Commentary Receives Punishment

Reuters, Tokyo - The cabinet formed by Admiral Yonai is regarded as inauspicious by superstitious believers, as the Japanese word "Yonai" sounds like "no rice." The background of Yonai's cabinet formation also adds to the panic of superstitious believers. The collapse of the Abe cabinet, as everyone knows, was intended to allow Army Minister Hata Shunroku to take office. Now, unexpectedly, the person chosen to form the cabinet is Yonai. The army is extremely resentful, feeling deceived. The army's newspaper, "Kokumin Shimbun," published a straightforward editorial criticizing the inappropriateness of the appointment, which has caused surprise in many quarters. However, the newspaper was punished with a ban on publication. The complexity of the situation when the news of Yonai's cabinet formation was announced can be seen in the fact that the Emperor took extraordinary steps within an hour of the announcement, summoning Hata Shunroku to the palace. According to "Asahi Shimbun," the Emperor instructed Hata Shunroku that day to find a way to get the army to support the new cabinet because the Emperor had already ordered Yonai to form the cabinet. Hata Shunroku, awed by the imperial order, replied that he would do his best to comply. That evening, Yonai met with Hata Shunroku again, asking for his cooperation to remain as Army Minister. Looking at the above situation, we might as well predict that we will see very interesting events in the Japanese political world again next spring, especially when the Diet reopens at the end of January.

### Japan Seeks to Prevent Malignant Inflation

Tokyo - According to reliable sources today, Japan's new Prime Minister Yonai will announce the government's policy direction in the Diet on February 1. Before that, he does not intend to reveal any government policies. At the same time, the new cabinet plans to reduce the budgets of the army, navy, and other departments to prevent a malignant cycle of inflation, continued high prices, and a large shortage of raw materials. It is heard that the new Finance Minister Sakurai will draft a new budget. (United Press, 19th)

### Japan-British Association Holds a Grand Banquet, a Chorus of Goodwill

Tokyo - At a banquet held by the Japan-British Association this afternoon to welcome the new military attache to the Japanese Embassy in Britain, Colonel Tatsumi Takau, and the Nogami couple who recently returned from a trip to Britain, speakers emphasized the friendship between Japan and Britain, and the opportunity to improve this friendship is in sight. The chairman was British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie, and his wife was also present. The British Ambassador's speech expressed his pleasure at the gathering of attendees and mentioned the important work of Colonel Tatsumi Takau in the future, saying that military attaches can greatly assist in improving relations between the two countries. He continued, "According to recent Japanese newspaper reports, the improvement of Anglo-Japanese relations depends on Britain's awakening. I dare say that after the colonel takes office, he will see that our country not only understands the situation in Europe but also understands the situation in the Far East. This is not a matter of sleepwalking, but an attempt to make us compatible in areas where we are incompatible. What is incompatible is not temperament, as the British and Japanese are quite compatible in this regard, but rather some policy issues. This will be a matter of mutual concessions to achieve the wishes of those present. I will stop here, otherwise, I will be criticized for giving a political speech." (Reuters, 19th)

### American Oil Merchants Are Only Interested in Profit, Continuing to Supply Japan with Kerosene, No Different Than Abetting Tyranny

Los Angeles - At a meeting of the Cole Committee today, Republican Congressman Hugh Futrell strongly attacked the United States for selling kerosene to Japan. However, Cranston, vice president of the Honolulu Consolidated Oil Company, vigorously defended this trade. According to Cranston, Japan purchases 100,000 barrels of kerosene here every day. If the United States were to stop this trade, the kerosene producers in this city would fall into "serious trouble." At this point, Hugh Futrell questioned Cranston, "However, is there no other way to maintain the lives of the people in our country other than helping others to kill people?" At this point, Cranston did not answer but said, "If we do not supply kerosene to Japan, Japan can still obtain kerosene from other countries." According to Hugh Futrell, "As far as I know, the price of kerosene supplied by Californians to Japan is even cheaper than the price obtained by consumers in Los Angeles. What is even more ridiculous is that the signs hung by the Los Angeles kerosene wells during Christmas, while acknowledging the birth of the Prince of Peace, the oil they refine day and night is used to slaughter unarmed Chinese people. This is too contradictory." (United Press, 19th)

### Borah's Condition Is Critical

Washington - Senator William Borah, a well-known veteran American politician, suffered a cerebral hemorrhage due to a fall. He is unconscious with a high fever. Doctors believe that there is little hope of prolonging his life, and he may reach a critical state within 24 hours. Washington officials were shocked by the news.

### US Navy Expansion Plan: Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee Proposes Amendment, Reducing Expenses Without Weakening Expansion Goals

Washington - Vincent, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, notified the committee yesterday that he would amend the naval shipbuilding bill he had previously drafted. He reduced the funds listed in the original bill from $1,300,000,000 to $800,000,000 and reduced 34 destroyers. The original plan recommended building 77 ships, totaling 400,000 tons, increasing naval strength by 25 percent. Vincent's amended bill recommends building 41 ships, totaling 218,000 tons, including the construction of aircraft carriers totaling 75,000 tons, enough to build three aircraft carriers with a displacement of 24,000 tons. The amended bill stipulates the construction of cruisers totaling 110,000 tons, the size of which will be determined by the naval authorities. In addition, 34,000 tons of submarines will be built. The original plan stipulated the construction of 45,000 tons of submarines. (United Press, 19th)

Vincent also explained that although the funds have been reduced, shipbuilding projects that can be effectively managed can still be carried out. He said it would be unwise to accumulate too many projects without actually carrying them out. The method he proposed to reduce shipbuilding expenses is not intended to weaken the navy.

### Military Supplies Cooperation Between Britain and France, Talks in London Have Ended, French Minister of Armaments Returns Home

London - The French Minister of Armaments, Raoul Dautry, came here to talk with the British Minister of Supply, Burgin, to discuss the manufacturing of military supplies between Britain and France.

(Havas, 18th)

London - Before returning home, the French Minister of Armaments, Raoul Dautry, gave a statement to a reporter from the "Daily Telegraph," saying that in general, people use the word cooperation to describe the relationship between Britain and France, but in reality, the word cooperation is too light, and should be replaced by the word unity. The two countries are about to build many factories in their respective territories and send specialized personnel to work in each other's factories. All scientific experimental equipment, various machines, artificial economic and financial resources are mutually used. In a word, there is no longer any so-called secret or border between Britain and France. Dautry also told a Havas reporter that the discussions he had with the British Minister of Supply, Burgin, were like a family collaboration. The division of labor between the two sides was very harmonious and without any friction. As far as the situation of military equipment manufacturing is concerned, the efforts made by the United Kingdom have already achieved remarkable results, which is admirable. In short, the cause of Anglo-French cooperation will be maintained without fail. The two sides have reached agreements in all aspects, and this is the case now and will be the case in the future. (Havas, 19th)

### The German Government Issues Another Statement, France Should Bear the Responsibility for the War, Accuses France of Echoing the British Program, Franco-German Understanding Ruined in One Fell Swoop

Berlin - The German government yesterday issued a second statement regarding the French Yellow Book, the original text of which is as follows: "According to the recent publication of the details of the visit to Paris by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in December 1938, it proves that in the winter of 1938, the preconditions for a permanent relaxation of tensions between Germany and France were already in place. Germany clearly expressed its abandonment of the demand to revise the western border, and the French Foreign Minister also announced that since the Munich Conference, France had completely changed its Eastern European policy and would not interfere in Germany's activities in Eastern and Central Europe. In other words, Germany and France mutually guaranteed not to infringe on each other's vital interests, and the dawn of Franco-German understanding appeared. Despite various objections within France, the French government did not abandon this policy until March 1939. On March 17, after Britain announced that the encirclement of Germany was its program, France blindly followed suit, and the opportunity for Franco-German understanding was ruined in one fell swoop. When Britain gave Poland a 'blank check,' France also signed it. When Britain unilaterally guaranteed Romania and Greece, France also endorsed it. France was actively involved in giving Turkey the Alexandretta issue and actively wooing Soviet Russia in order to complete the encirclement front, which shows that in the spring of 1939, France had destroyed the foundation of the Franco-German Declaration. On July 1, 1939, French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with German Ambassador Weizsäcker and gave him a written consultation, which he asked him to send to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In it, he stated that France had decided to maintain its promise to Poland under all circumstances. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop wrote to the French Foreign Minister on July 13 of the same year, the original text of which is as follows: 'July 13, 1939, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop respectfully writes to French Foreign Minister Bonnet, having received a letter from Your Excellency's Ambassador Weizsäcker on July 1, after reading it, I have to inform Your Excellency about the attitude of my government towards Franco-German relations and the Danzig issue. Since our two countries signed the Franco-German Declaration on December 6, 1938, we have mutually guaranteed that the borders of the two countries are final and committed ourselves to good neighborliness. My government is still willing to follow this policy today, but Your Excellency states that regarding the third clause of the Franco-German Declaration, the reservation on the relationship between Germany and France and third countries, my country believes that this reservation cannot be applied to Franco-Polish relations, because during the preparatory negotiations held in Berlin and Paris before the signing, and during the final signing in Paris, it was clearly understood that the so-called special relationship refers to France and Britain, Germany and Italy, which no other country can be mixed into. At that time, I also pointed out that in order to establish friendly relations between the two countries, it is necessary to respect each other's vital interests, pointing out that Eastern Europe is within Germany's sphere of interest. Your Excellency strongly stated at the time that after the Munich Conference, France's attitude towards the Eastern European issue had fundamentally changed, but Your Excellency's letter this time overturns the previous statement, stating that if the status quo of Danzig is changed, France will immediately provide Poland with military assistance. Regarding this point, I would like to state a few things on the left, (1) Germany has never interfered with France's vital interests, therefore, it firmly rejects such interference by France. German-Polish relations and the Danzig issue are issues of German policy and cannot be obstructed by France, (2) Regarding Your Excellency's question about Germany's attitude towards Poland, I can answer as follows: After Germany proposed a peaceful resolution to the German-Polish relations and the Danzig issue to Poland, Poland's reply, threatening war, was unexpected. It is not yet known whether Poland will revise this strange attitude. If Poland invades Danzig, Germany will immediately send troops to destroy the Polish army in response, (3) The last sentence of Your Excellency's letter, namely the military assistance to Poland, if it is the intention of French policy, then I inform Your Excellency that this threat can only strengthen the determination of Chancellor Hitler to defend Germany's interests with all his might. Chancellor Hitler believes that there is no conflict of vital interests between Germany and France, that is, there is no need for a second war. If France deliberately starts a war, then Germany is ready to fight at any time, but the responsibility for the war must be borne solely by the French government before France and all its people. When the Franco-German Declaration was signed, Your Excellency and I were in a good mood. This decision to be forced to disturb the situation is unavoidable, I hope you will consider it.'"

According to this document, the reason why the foundation of Franco-German understanding could not be successfully cultivated was that France followed British policy. France cannot shirk the historical responsibility for starting the war. (Haitong Press, 19th)

### Great Contribution of Soviet Medical Community, Using the Latest Treatment Methods to Make the Blind See the Light of Day Again

TASS Special Article - In 1939, Soviet medicine achieved great success. In ophthalmology, Soviet medical personnel devoted themselves to studying methods for treating "glaucoma" and "cataracts." "Glaucoma" is an incurable disease that can cause blindness. According to the research results of the Soviet medical community, the crux of this disease is not in the eye but in the nervous system and the brain. Regarding this point, the Soviet medical community is currently continuing its research and will soon obtain new treatment methods. Also, regarding "cataracts," only surgery can be used to treat them. In the past few years, Soviet medical personnel have experimented on animals with scurvy and found that the vitamin C contained in the aqueous humor of the eye has a very strong impact on the movement of the lens of the eye. After they discovered this, they believed that "cataracts" could be cured without surgery. In 1940, Soviet medical personnel will use vitamin C on a large scale to treat cataracts and prevent the occurrence of cataracts.

### If Northern Europe Is Invaded, Britain and France Will Never Stand By, The Same Measures Will Be Taken for the Near East, The Scope of British Aid to Finland Is Under Discussion

London - The recent trade agreement between Britain and Sweden is highly valued by the general public here. It is said that Germany imports a large quantity of iron ore from Sweden every year for military industrial use. Until recently, this quantity had greatly declined. Now that the trade agreement between Britain and Sweden has been concluded, it will be gradually reduced, which shows that the negotiations conducted by Britain with the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula are very successful. Responsible officials also said that if these countries are attacked, Britain and France will never stand by. The measures taken by Britain and France in recent days, especially the various measures regarding aid to Finland, are aimed at placing these countries in a more advantageous position so that they can be more effectively protected if the Nordic countries are invaded in the future. At the same time, the same measures will be taken for the countries of the Near East to ensure that Britain and France can immediately provide assistance if something happens to these countries in the future.

Washington - Well-informed sources say that there is no sign of how the United States will provide assistance to Finland. It is extremely difficult to figure out how to dispel the doubts of the opposition. Certain important congressmen are trying to find a compromise solution, the content of which is nothing more than lending money to Finland so that it can purchase agricultural tools from the United States, and then use these agricultural tools to exchange for military supplies through the Anglo-French Purchasing Committee in the United States. (Havas, 18th)

New York - The New York Herald Tribune today commented on the issue of the United States lending money to Finland, saying that the fate of Finland is of special importance to the United States and urged the United States to provide assistance to Finland.

### Chen Lifu Issues Statement After Returning to Chongqing

Chongqing: Minister of Education Chen Lifu returned to Chongqing on the 18th and issued the following statement: I flew from Chongqing to Yunnan on December 24th to attend the annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers. I took a car to Guizhou on January 5th and returned to Chongqing. The trip took about four weeks. In addition to attending the annual meeting in Kunming, I also took the opportunity to inspect primary schools and higher education institutions in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and provided instructions based on the conditions of each school. I gave a total of seventy-two public speeches. In general, the teachers and students of each school were able to appreciate the great intention of the country in establishing schools and education, and I found a good spirit of striving, working hard, and enduring hardship everywhere. The students are also more serious and diligent in their studies than before, which is very gratifying. Although primary education in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces has shown progress, the treatment of teachers and the training of teachers still need to be improved and worked on. The relevant authorities in Yunnan and Guizhou are now paying close attention to this. As for secondary education, Yunnan Province should find ways to improve its quality, while Guizhou Province should actively increase both its quality and quantity. In addition, the teaching tools for natural sciences in various schools are mostly incomplete and need to be added and supplemented. The library and equipment of various universities are extremely lacking, and student management and military training also need to be improved. (Dispatch, 19th)

### Sichuan and Xikang Implement Thorough Opium Prohibition

Chongqing: Opium prohibition in Sichuan is being carried out severely. Yesterday, a reporter learned that Li Huang, Director of the First Office of the Sichuan-Xikang Construction Promotion Association, and Huang Yanpei, Director of the Second Office, had successively come to Chongqing. A special visit was made to inquire about the opium prohibition situation in various places. They were informed as follows: The Sichuan-Xikang Construction Promotion Association offices have now been established separately. The scope of the work undertaken is based on the Sichuan-Xikang construction plan resolved by the Fourth National Political Council. However, when the council members were about to depart, the speaker proposed opium prohibition and bandit suppression as the most important tasks at present. Therefore, special attention was paid to these two points during inspections, supervision, and assessment. Observing the situation, the personnel responsible for opium prohibition in various places were awed by the speaker's determination to thoroughly prohibit opium, and they were able to uphold and practice it. The local gentry and the people were very excited to hear the meeting reports. This is indeed a good sign for the future of opium prohibition. Those who occasionally test the law will be reported to the government and punished according to the law, and will never be lenient, so that those who commit crimes will know to be vigilant. However, the century-old opium poison is deeply rooted. If we want to clear it up once and for all, we must make long-term and continuous efforts. Local gentry and people must work together to achieve thorough results. At this time, the government's thunderous authority has achieved a solid foundation for opium prohibition. (Dispatch, 19th)

### Price Controls on Grains in Beiping Temporarily Lifted

Beiping: Reuters, according to reliable foreign sources, if the current shortage of flour continues, foreigners will feel inconvenience, or there may be concerns about not being able to obtain bread. Local merchants are now using their stocks. The situation improved slightly yesterday. According to an official announcement, price controls on grains have been temporarily lifted, and efforts are being made to import two million bags of flour before the Lunar New Year. Currently, due to price controls and the requisition of stocks by Chinese and Japanese authorities, Chinese residents, especially the poor, are unable to purchase grains. The official flour price limit is set at around eight yuan per bag, but merchants with stocks are still selling at a price of fifteen yuan per bag. Due to the deteriorating situation, the authorities have had no choice but to distribute food tickets to poor residents through the police. However, many abuses have been discovered, and residents are being charged for the food tickets distributed. Since the official control was lifted, the price of flour has increased by 15% yesterday, and then rose to 18 yuan per bag, but there is still no large quantity available for purchase.

### The Great Victory of Chinese Forces in Northern Guangdong; Japanese Forces Took a Risky Venture Through Xinfeng; Cut Off by Chinese Forces, the Entire Line Collapsed; Chinese Forces Buried More Than Three Thousand Japanese Corpses; Captured Military Supplies Worth Thirty Million Hong Kong Dollars; Countless Armored Vehicles, Tanks, Mules, and Horses

Shantou Correspondence: In this battle, the Japanese army launched a three-pronged attack on northern Guangdong, with the right wing being the most fierce. This route of the Japanese army, starting from Zengcheng, advanced along the Dongjiang North Road, entering locations such as Mazha, Liang Kouxu, and Niubeiji in Longmen County. This area is a region of rugged mountains. Since the Republic of China, there have been internal wars one after another, and no military strategists dared to pass through this road. The Japanese army actually advanced from here, which shows how risky their venture was. This route of the Japanese army, with over 18,000 men, was originally an elite unit stationed in northern Manchuria to defend against the Soviets. Last winter, they were ordered to return to China. The soldiers thought they could leave military service and enjoy family reunions, but unexpectedly, before they could rest, they were transferred to Guangzhou. Their morale declined, and they had no desire to fight. Therefore, despite being an elite unit, they were ultimately cut off and crushed by the Chinese forces of Peng Linsheng and Zhao Yijian. As for the Chinese forces, after arriving in Wengyuan and Xinfeng, they cleared the remnants of the Japanese army in Jinzhuyuan, Shatian, Meikeng, Huameitang, and other places south of Qingtang. They continued to sweep south and surrounded over a thousand Japanese soldiers who had entrenched themselves in the mountainous area around Gutian Daping, south of Lyutianxu, and fought fiercely overnight. The Japanese army suffered more than half casualties, and corpses were scattered everywhere. Gutian Daping was subsequently recovered, and a large number of military supplies were captured. The survivors retreated to the area of Jilonggang, Guancun, and Shikeng northeast of Conghua. On the morning of the 8th, Zhao's division and the Liu Jingwu regiment of Lin Weichou's division, who were stationed at Ludongdong on the border between Zengcheng and Longmen, joined forces to attack Jilonggang and Shikeng. The Japanese army's Yado Brigade fought Zhao and Lin's divisions for four hours, then collapsed towards Guancun, Fengyuan, Hélùjing, and Shengang. Some fled back to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Most of the Chinese forces stationed at Niubeiji and Liang Kouxu attacked Conghua City along the Xincóng Road on the 8th and recovered Conghua City on the morning of the 11th. The remaining Japanese forces retreated towards Guangzhou.

The Japanese army's defeat in this battle was most disastrous in several battles within Wengyuan, including Wuguandu, Sanhua, Meikeng, and Xinfeng. Because the mountains are high and the forests are dense in each of these places, Japanese aircraft could not assist in combat. Japanese tanks and heavy ordnance could not exert their power. The ravines between the valleys were crisscrossed. Japanese armored vehicles, tanks, cavalry, etc., were completely useless. As a result, the Chinese forces captured 270 tanks that had been destroyed. At the beginning of the Japanese army's northward advance, they forcibly conscripted laborers and grooms in Guangzhou. Those who were conscripted hated them to the bone. Therefore, above Meikeng, they scattered and fled into the mountains. The Japanese mules and horses were unattended. They ran around in the artillery fire, and in less than half a day, they scattered. They left behind mountain guns, baggage, and provisions, piled up in the trails, causing the Chinese forces and civilians to have to detour. The Chinese forces and civilians captured 2,600 mules and horses. It is reported that they were produced in Northeast China. The number of mountain guns and field guns was considerable, filling the road, so that the Chinese forces and civilians had to detour.

When the Chinese forces recovered Wengyuan and Sanhua, the Japanese army, because the retreat route in Meikeng had been cut off, dispersed towards Fogang County. The Chinese forces advancing southward along the west bank of the Yingde North River reached south of Hengshi on the 5th and attacked Qingyuan City in three routes. On the 11th, the Japanese forces were attacked by the Zhang and Wang divisions and entered the city, resulting in fierce street fighting. The Japanese army then collapsed southward, and the Chinese forces recovered Qingyuan City and divided into two routes to cross the North River. One route went straight to Xinjie on the Yuehan Road along Longtang and Yinzhan, and the other route went out of Shijiao and Guotai and ambushed in Chiní and Bainí, and they are now surrounded and annihilated. Between Yinzhan'ao and Shijiao, there are 3,000 remnants of the Japanese army, surrounded by Chinese forces. The Japanese army that fled from Lyutian to Pingtan was completely annihilated. The more than 1,000 Japanese troops retreating south from Yingde along the Yuehan Railway collapsed into the mountains. With the help of the local militia, the Chinese forces tracked them down. On the evening of the 7th, the Chinese forces captured Fogang County.

It is said that the Japanese army that invaded the north in this battle was the 18th Division, the 104th Division, the 108th Division, and the Konoe Mixed Brigade, totaling 100,000 men. The 55th Regiment of the 18th Division was annihilated in the narrowness of Meikeng and Jinzhuyuan. The 104th Division and the 108th Division were cut into several sections in Yinzhan'ao, Yuantan, Lianjiangkou, and Pajiangkou, and corpses were left behind in Guandu, Sanhua, Qingtang, Dazhen, Shilong, Shatian, Meikeng, Lyutian, Zuotan, Liang Kouxu, Hetou, Yingde, and Lianjiangkou, filling the mountains and valleys. The Chinese forces buried more than 3,000 corpses of the Japanese army on behalf of them. Six thousand Japanese officers, including Oada Aqing, erected wooden plaques as a record. The 12th Army Corps captured two artillery pieces, 170 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 4,000 rifles. Other units captured countless military supplies, which have not yet been fully calculated. According to military experts, the value is at least more than 30 million Hong Kong dollars. Just in terms of military radio transceivers, there are as many as 70 units. Others can be imagined.

### Japanese Forces in Wuxi Threaten the People, City Gates Not Fully Opened, Women and Children Allowed to Pass

Wuxi Correspondence: After the puppet governor Yang Shoutong was shot and killed, the Japanese side made a big fuss. The city gates were tightly closed, and traffic was cut off for a week. After several days of searching the city, many innocent people were arrested by the Japanese army as murderers. The people inside and outside the city, because their food supply had been cut off, were given porridge by the Red Swastika Society at 1:00 or 2:00 p.m. every day to fill their stomachs, and this had to be approved by the Japanese side. From the 15th, the Japanese army allowed Guangfu Gate and South Gate to open, but only for women and children under the age of twelve, and they must have a pass. The time for passage is from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Men are generally not allowed to pass. From the 16th, traffic outside the city was allowed from Wuqiao, Aolongqiao, Yinglongqiao, Qingmingqiao, Xinglongqiao, Tingziqiao, Shirenqiao, and Tangnanqiao. The day before yesterday, the Japanese army learned that Yang Shoutong was killed at the entrance of a foreign goods store in Sixiangkou. At that time, all the staff in the store were tied up with ropes and stabbed with bayonets. Everyone was seriously injured and is now being treated at Puren Hospital. The goods in the store were also completely destroyed. Teahouses, hotels, and hostels inside and outside the city have not been allowed to resume business. Travelers from Shanghai who take the train to Wuxi, if they arrive in Wuxi after the passing time, have no way to deal with it, and most return to Shanghai or Suzhou. Water and land transportation have not been restored to their original state. The people of Wuxi, after this threat, are full of complaints and do not want to stay in the city. There are quite a few who have fled to the countryside.

### Fujian Province Deploys Guerrilla Warfare, Coastal Counties Have Been Fully Prepared

Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Authorities are aware that the coastal counties are under the threat of Japanese military force and are likely to be attacked at any time. To facilitate flexible operations in the future, so that the military and civilians do not lose contact and local administration is not affected, a special order was issued to all counties to build guerrilla bases in the rear, construct strong fortifications, and store rice, medicine, and daily necessities for future needs. After receiving the order, the counties, after some time of effort, have completed the deployment according to the planned plan. The supplies are fully prepared, and the entire project has reached perfection. The construction is carried out by utilizing the terrain behind a certain number of miles from the coastline, and the engineering is extremely ingenious. The governments of the coastal counties of Dongshan, Zhaoan, Tongan, Haicheng, Jinjiang, and Fuqing have all moved to safe areas for the convenience of peacetime administration and wartime command. The city walls and bunkers in important cities such as Fuzhou and Quanzhou, which had previously been partially destroyed, are now being torn down completely to avoid hindering future guerrilla warfare. The empty houses in Quanzhou are also being demolished to avoid hiding traitors. Residents in coastal villages in Tongan and Hui'an are being ordered by the government to move to designated locations to avoid being shelled by Japanese warships or bombed by Japanese aircraft at any time. Unemployed people in the coastal counties are being transported by the Provincial Relief Association to the interior of northwestern Fujian for reclamation or to work in factories.

### The Republic of China, Year 28: A Review of Chinese Education (3)

— Chen Lijiang

(III) General Education

General education, including secondary and primary education, has also seen considerable creation and advancement in terms of principles. (1) "Division of School Districts": The distribution of schools in various regions used to be very uneven, but recently, the measure of dividing school districts has been adopted to correct this deficiency. Provincial education departments have divided the entire province into several middle school districts, so that middle schools within the district are appropriately allocated and can develop evenly. Currently, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces have all implemented this. (2) "Revision of Curriculum Standards": There is a significant need for improvement in the subjects and hours of senior and junior high schools. Regarding these courses, the Ministry of Education is currently gathering opinions from various parties and is working on sorting and revising them. Furthermore, in the past, there were no standards for running kindergartens, but now the Kindergarten Regulations have been formulated and promulgated. (3) "Holding of Summer Workshops": Continuing training and further education for middle school teachers is very important. This summer, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces have all separately convened middle school teachers to conduct lectures and discussions to provide training. In the field of vocational education, the Ministry of Education has also designated National Central University and other schools to separately run summer workshops on agricultural and industrial education in Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Kangding provinces, so that teachers of all subjects can have opportunities for further study. (4) "Training of Education Administrative Officials": The central government has provided few training opportunities for education administrative personnel in various provinces, such as senior officials of education departments and principals of middle schools and section chiefs of county education bureaus. However, this year, the fourth session of the Party and Government Training Class of the Central Training Corps specially gathered 500 education administrative personnel from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Hubei provinces to provide training. For example, the Ministry of Education convened a meeting of middle school principals in Sichuan Province to discuss re-election, etc., which has greatly influenced administrative improvement. (5) "Improvement and Supplementation of Textbooks for Primary and Secondary Schools": Most textbooks were compiled before the war and lacked materials on the War of Resistance, nation-building, and the General Mobilization of National Spirit. However, now the Ministry of Education has compiled supplementary wartime teaching materials for various subjects to remedy this. At the same time, it is also compiling various suitable textbooks for primary and secondary schools and vocational schools for use by various schools. (6) "Addition and Reform of National Middle Schools": This year, three national middle schools have been added, and more than 5,000 students who lost their schooling in the war zone have been admitted. Regarding the division of branch schools, the management of students, the rectification of academic atmosphere, and the assessment of the responsibilities and treatment of teachers and the examination of teaching performance, on the one hand, rectification methods have been formulated and implemented, and on the other hand, principals' meetings have been held to discuss the solution of various practical problems, resulting in considerable improvement. (7) "Promotion of Normal Education": Various provinces still lack overall planning for normal education, but under the guidance of the Ministry of Education, Guizhou, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Gansu, Kangding, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces have now formulated and implemented overall implementation plans. The Ministry of Education has also stipulated the implementation of measures for normal schools to guide local education, making normal schools the guidance center for primary school teachers. (8) "Promotion of Vocational Education": Vocational schools have also expanded considerably this year. The central government has newly established the National Sichuan Vocational School of Paper Making and Printing, and has allocated 300,000 yuan to designate various schools to expand more than 30 training classes in various industries, and has widely established junior practical vocational schools in various provinces. In addition, plans are underway to establish production organizations in various vocational schools. Such training can better meet actual needs. (9) "Promotion of Compulsory Education": This year, the central government's funding for compulsory education has increased by more than 2.8 million yuan compared with last year, and the amount of subsidies to various provinces has also increased accordingly. In terms of organization, the Ministry of Education has reorganized and expanded the Compulsory Education Committee, which has provided great impetus for its implementation. (10) Other activities, such as holding graduation exams, providing relief to teachers and students in the war zone, and experimenting with card literacy teaching methods, are continuing to be promoted as in the previous year, all showing good results.

### Sichuan Province Middle School Graduates to Hold Joint Examination Tomorrow

### Zhejiang Province Orders the Promulgation of Elementary School Teacher Registration Measures

### Tongzhou Middle School Expansion

Tongzhou Middle School, located at 850 Xiaoshadu Road, was founded after the fall of Nantong, originally to provide relief to young people who had lost their schooling. Classes are held in Shanghai. It has gone through two summers and winters, and has achieved remarkable results, earning the trust of society. Since it was registered by the Jiangsu Department of Education last year, it has been actively improving and sparing no effort. The existing school buildings are spacious, with six large classrooms, one large playground, and one dining hall. There is also a library and a laboratory. In the spring of last year, a large building was built specifically for student accommodation. Everything needed by the school is available. The teachers of the school are mostly colleagues from provincial schools, with both academic knowledge and experience. Teaching and discipline are carried out in accordance with the principles of thoroughness and strictness. The improvement plan proposed in the previous academic year included: (1) intensifying teaching in various subjects and providing sufficient practice; (2) supervising self-study; (3) strictly enforcing examinations; (4) implementing morning exercises; (5) disciplining student life; and (6) holding academic competitions. All of these have been implemented, and it is planned to continue to promote them in the next term in order to improve students' level and make solid preparations for further education. This session is recruiting transfer students for the first and second grades of senior and junior high school. Registration will be accepted until the day before the examination. The examination will be held on January 22nd.

### Settlement of the Extraterritorial Road Construction Negotiation; Police Issues to be Compromised; A New Police Organization to be Formed Jointly by Both Sides; The Outstanding Case of Collecting Donations Will Also be Resolved Successively

Negotiations between the Public Concession's Municipal Council and the puppet city government regarding the issue of extraterritorial road construction are currently being discussed by General Manager Philippe and Fu Xiao'an to form a new policy organization to manage the administration of the extraterritorial road construction area. This new organization could be established by the end of February. The details are as follows:

Negotiations Between Both Sides Reportedly to be Resolved

According to the Continental News, yesterday (the 18th), General Manager and Director Philippe of the Municipal Council and "Mayor of Shanghai" Fu Xiao'an were engaged in negotiations. If no unforeseen serious obstacles occur, a new police organization will take over the extraterritorial road construction area of the city before the end of February. The organization of this agency and the management of this police force have been drafted. Although not formally accepted by either party, it is reported to have been approved by the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government."

Police Organization Jointly Formed by Both Sides

The agency will be named the "Extraterritorial Road Construction Police Bureau" and will be jointly managed by the Municipal Council's Police Department and the "Shanghai Municipal Government." The entire extraterritorial road construction area, which has been in dispute for more than a year, will be under the jurisdiction of this new agency. If the police aspect is properly negotiated, one of the two outstanding cases regarding the extremely important extraterritorial road construction issue encountered by the Municipal Council will be resolved.

The Issue of Collecting Donations Can Also be Compromised

The two parties also began discussing another outstanding case in the area of collecting donations some time ago in order to obtain a resolution. It is reported that the two parties will reach an agreement on this issue immediately after the police reconciliation.

Puppet Government Appoints Personnel to Serve as Police Chief

According to news obtained yesterday, the Extraterritorial Road Construction Police Bureau will be headed by a police chief selected by the "Shanghai Municipal Government," and the deputy police chief will be appointed by the Municipal Council. In addition, the headquarters staff will consist of 40 people, with each party sending half. Their names must be exchanged with each other before final appointment, and both the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" reserve the right to reject any person sent by the other party.

Several Details Have Not Yet Been Agreed Upon

Although the above organization has been approved by both parties, several details have not yet been agreed upon. It is reported that the Municipal Council is now requesting that the new agency be given full power, and the Police Department also feels that once this new police force is in charge of the area, it cannot allow various sinful places in the area to continue to operate.

All Evil in Bad Territories Must be Eradicated

It is a recognized fact that the extraterritorial road construction area is a concentration of gambling dens and drug trafficking activities. Licensed Tu Hangs continue to exist and operate prosperously, and gambling dens are constantly increasing. Since these activities are strictly prohibited and punished by law within the Public Concession, the Municipal Council cannot tolerate its police force, which is jointly managed by senior police officers, allowing these activities to exist.

### Industrial and Commercial Circles Should Stand Firm, Work Hard to Produce; The Ministry Clearly Explains the Truth About Restrictions on Domestic Sales in a Telegram to Shanghai

The Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Association sent a telegram to inquire about the truth about the restrictions on the domestic transportation of national products. It received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that there is absolutely no discrimination against industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai that have not been seized and utilized by the enemy, and hoping that they will not be confused by rumors. The Shanghai industrial and commercial circles were very pleased to hear this news. The Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Association has sent the original telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to its member manufacturers for information, and encouraged them to stand firm during this extraordinary period, work hard in wartime production, and live up to the expectations of the authorities.

According to a letter from Zhanghua Woolen Textile Company, "The report on the 18th of this month stated that goods were not allowed to be imported into Ningbo, which was a list announced by the Navigation Department. The products of our company are also on the list of prohibited items. We were very surprised to read this. Our company's Shanghai Special Zone New Factory products have been presented to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the issuance of National Goods Certificates No. 156 and 157, and have been approved for transportation and sale in the mainland. We believe that the Department was not aware of the details, resulting in a misunderstanding. We are deeply concerned that the outside world does not know the truth and ask you to publish this so as not to cause confusion."

### The American Ambassador Will Contact Diplomatic Circles in Shanghai; Met with Kato and Colonel Baker Yesterday; Claimed that Trip to Hankou Was Only a Tour

American Ambassador to China Johnson arrived in Shanghai by ship on the morning of the 18th and was extremely busy all day. In addition to meeting with Consul General Gauss at the Cathay Hotel at 10:00 a.m., he also received Japanese Envoy Kato at the Ambassador's office at 11:00 a.m. for about 20 minutes of talks. The Ambassador also met with the newly appointed Commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai, Colonel Baker, in the afternoon.

To Hankou on Monday

The Ambassador will spend the weekend in Shanghai and is scheduled to travel west on the American ship Luzon on the 22nd with Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the American Yangtze River Patrol, to inspect the overseas Chinese affairs in Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang and other places, and then meet with the American Consul General in Hankou to listen to a report on the current situation. The American ship Wohu will accompany the Ambassador to Hankou at that time to provide protection, replacing the position of the Guam, which has left Hankou. The Ambassador is scheduled to return here on February 6.

Diplomatic Activities

During his stay in Shanghai, the Ambassador will have diplomatic activities and make routine contacts with diplomatic circles in various countries, and then wait for a ship to Hong Kong to fly to Chongqing to meet with the British and French Ambassadors to deal with official business. According to the Ambassador, his trip to Shanghai, and then to Hankou next week and back to Chongqing, has no special significance, and is only routine official business. He did not want to make any comments on political issues.

Concern for American Merchants

This trip of the Ambassador to Hankou is still the first among the ambassadors of various countries after the Japanese army occupied the Yangtze River. Although the Ambassador stated that he and Rear Admiral Glassford were traveling to Hankou by ship for routine inspection and did not contain any special meaning, and had no mutual relationship with the Japanese side's opening of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it is generally believed that the Ambassador's sudden trip to the Yangtze River must be for the purpose of studying the current situation of American overseas Chinese, the trend after the opening, and the American trade issues in the Yangtze River, and to obtain a reference, and will decide on the issue of the Japanese side's willingness to consider the export of more than a thousand tons of diesel oil for American merchants in the Yangtze River.

### Zhang Yunhe, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of this Newspaper, Cremated Yesterday; Numerous Mourners, Extremely Honored

The news of the death of Mr. Zhang Yunhe, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of this newspaper, has been detailed in previous reports. Yesterday was the day of Mr. Zhang's cremation. The scene at the time is described as follows:

Arrangement of the Funeral Hall

Above the auditorium was a half-length portrait of Mr. Zhang, slightly to the right, lifelike. The wreaths given by various sectors surrounded the right side of the shock. Before the seat were sacrificial dishes, white candles burned high, and incense swirled. A mourning couplet was hung next to it, mourned by Mr. Shen Enfu. The upper line said, "Holding the pen for nearly forty years, regretting the difficulties of the times, sick for a long time and seeing the return of the homeland," and the lower line said, "Three years away from rare age, sadly recalling friendship, unwilling to talk about life in old age." The colleagues of this newspaper said in a couplet, "Clear demeanor and bright integrity, the object of public admiration, forty years of dedication and labor, there should be sincerity to rely on future generations, and the colleagues of the editorial department said in a couplet, "Remembering the thirty years of fame on the forum, long admiring the pure fragrance, and thinking that Da Die was in front, Mr. Duan should enjoy the blessing, mourning the recent four or five years, raising illness in the house, and still bearing the teaching, how can we expect Xiu Wen to go to the summons, and the colleagues all sadly lost their mentor."

Removal of the Coffin After Cremation

In the afternoon, mourners from all sides came in an endless stream, such as Chen Taoyi, Tang Dingzhi, Min Ruizhi, Wang Boqi, Yan Duhe, etc., more than a hundred people. All the colleagues of this newspaper went to hold the coffin, and representatives from the Commercial Press, the Newspaper Industry Union, and the Newspaper Workers School all went. The coffin was sealed at two o'clock, dressed in a blue robe and black gown. After the coffin was sealed, the guests paid their respects, and then the coffin was moved to the Wan'an coffin storage place on Haige Road Yidingpan Road. After holding a public memorial ceremony, the guests dispersed.

### Muslim Eid al-Adha Festival Today; Citywide Celebrations; Muslim Classics; Assemble on Time

Today is the Muslim festival of sacrifice, Eid al-Adha. All Muslims who are able must go to Mecca to make a pilgrimage to the Kaaba, which is an essential part of a Muslim's life. Those who are not able can go to the local mosque to participate in the Eid al-Adha prayers. Therefore, this morning, one-eighth of the world's population will commemorate the sacrificial spirit of the Prophet Abraham and his son Ishmael, and will make a great prayer under the training of firm faith, fully expressing their unity and courage. The mosques in the city are scheduled to hold Eid al-Adha prayers at 9:00 a.m. today, so Muslims in the city will gather at the mosques on time, which will be a grand occasion.

### Japanese Bombing of the Huangpu River and Blocking of Money; Retreating When Knowing it is Difficult; Failure to Succeed After Two Years of Raising Time; Technical Guards Have Returned to Tokyo

There are more than a dozen large iron-hulled ships among the underwater obstacles left by the Chinese army blocking money in the 16th shop. It has taken the Japanese two years, and there are still six or seven large ships. Because there is too much mud in the hulls, not only is it difficult to salvage, but even if they are all bombed, it is impossible to place a large amount of explosives because there are so many ships entering and leaving the area. Therefore, the technical specialists commissioned by the Japanese side all feel that they are technically exhausted and helpless, and have returned to Tokyo early. It has been rumored that when the tide in the Huangpu River is small in winter, they will come to China again to completely destroy the underwater obstacles in order to restore the navigation of the southern Huangpu River and allow large ships to enter and leave both sides of the South Huangpu River. However, in the blink of an eye, winter is coming to an end and spring is coming. There has been no movement in the Huangpu River in recent days, which proves that the Japanese side has retreated when knowing that this huge project is difficult.

### Flat Price Rice Sales to Begin Tomorrow; Authorities to Ensure Order; Continued Fundraising for Flat Price Rice Sales Aims for Sustainability; Procurement Committee Approves Continued Ordering of Tribute Rice; Location for Receiving Flat Price Rice Must Match the Rice Ticket Number

The Commissioner of Police of the Public Concession issued a notice on the 18th of this month, stating: The Shanghai Flat Price Rice Committee, in view of the high rice prices, has purchased a batch of Saigon broken rice and established flat price rice distribution points in the Public Concession and the French Concession, entrusting various rice shops to handle ticket sales and rice distribution. This flat price rice sale is purely a charitable endeavor, intended to benefit the people's livelihood. All rice purchasers must understand this intention, strictly maintain order, and not cause trouble. Any unruly individuals who cause disturbances at the rice shops will be immediately arrested and severely punished. This notice is hereby issued.

Flat Price Sale Dates: From January 21st, daily from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM

Limit on Rice Purchase: Six and a half catties (market catties) per yuan; each person limited to one yuan.

Flat Price Foreign Rice: Arriving in batches

The Flat Price Rice Committee entrusted the British firm Jardine Matheson & Co. to order 1,500 tons of broken Saigon rice, which has been shipped to Shanghai in three batches. The first batch of 300 tons, loaded on the French postal ship "Felix Roussel," arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. The second batch of 300 tons, loaded on the Italian postal ship "Fusiyama," is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 21st. The third batch of 900 tons, loaded on the Italian postal ship "Sammartula," is expected to arrive around the 25th. As for the 20,068 bags of Saigon broken rice purchased from the Shanghai market, the payment has been cleared and delivery has begun. Starting today, they will be distributed to the various flat price rice shops to handle the flat price sales. All flat price procedures, such as rice tickets, account books, and new dippers, have been completed by the Flat Price Committee and are approved for sale starting on the 21st (Sunday). It is stipulated that there are a total of 50 locations in the two concessions. Rice tickets purchased at the first location are only allowed to be redeemed at the designated rice shop for the first location. Each location will sell 50 bags of rice per day, until they are sold out. Calculated at six and a half catties per yuan, the average selling price is approximately 25 yuan in national currency per picul of 160 catties.

Actively Raising Funds: Sustainable Operation

In order to operate the flat price rice sales sustainably, the Flat Price Rice Committee is actively soliciting flat price donations from various industries. The confirmed donations from various industries are 500,000 yuan for the first round and 62,000 yuan for the second round. Fundraising is currently continuing in various industries, and it is hoped that all sectors will voluntarily donate, striving to reach the goal of one million yuan. The receiving agencies are the Zhongnan Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Shanghai Bank, and the Tongrun Qianzhuang, Zifeng Qianzhuang. In addition, Zhao Fuji personally volunteered to donate 5,000 yuan, which has been sent to Jin Cheng Bank for collection. His enthusiasm for flat price rice sales is truly admirable. Furthermore, Huang Yuzhai donated 500 yuan, which was mistakenly printed as 50 yuan yesterday.

Second Batch of Ordered Rice: Approved

The People's Food Regulation Association held its fourth executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported on the following matters: ① The treasurer reported that the Jin Cheng Bank escrow account had received over 290,000 yuan in deposit from households who entrusted the association to order foreign rice, totaling over 14,000 bags. In addition to the 6,000 bags already ordered, another 8,000 bags need to be ordered. ② The secretary reported that the Purchasing Committee is planning to order another batch of No. 2 Saigon rice on the 22nd of this month based on the application amounts from various households, which has been approved by the executive committee members. Matters for discussion: ① The warehousing insurance fees and interest for the first 6,000 bags of foreign rice ordered on behalf of the households will be cleared by the treasurer, and then a letter will be sent to each ordering household to prepare funds for delivery. Apart from the aforementioned necessary expenses, the association will not charge any additional fees. ② The second batch of foreign rice will be ordered on the 22nd of this month. The quantity will be based on the application amounts as of the 21st of this month, and the Purchasing Committee will handle the procurement. The delivery must be made to warehouses in the safe zone of the British and French Concessions. The chairman and treasurer will jointly sign the order on behalf of the association. ③ Some households have entrusted the association to order broken rice, but the quantity is small and it is inconvenient to place a separate order. It is proposed to notify these households to withdraw their deposits. The association will temporarily not order broken rice on behalf of households, but will only order No. 2 Saigon rice. ④ For public associations that have pledged funds to the association, it should be verified with the Flat Price Rice Committee whether all or part of the funds have been transferred to flat price rice donations. The remaining amount should still be requested from the public associations. ⑤ Additional appointments: Yan Fang and Guo Shun were appointed as members of the association's Purchasing Committee. ⑥ Cao Xinxi sent a letter resigning from the association's Purchasing Committee, and it was decided to send a letter earnestly requesting him to stay.

### Assault on American Woman: Official Japanese Apology; U.S. Consulate Deems Unsatisfactory; No Decision on Further Action

According to the English "China Press," regarding the assault on American citizen Miss Donaldson by a Japanese sentry, the U.S. Consul General has received an apology from the Japanese side but deems it unsatisfactory. Yesterday (the 18th), when Miss Donaldson went to the U.S. Consulate, two Japanese naval officers wearing medals and carrying swords verbally apologized to Miss Donaldson. Miss Donaldson, as instructed by consulate officials, was not allowed to speak to reporters. According to Mr. Porter of the U.S. Consulate, "All I am prepared to say is that the U.S. Consulate has received a letter from the Japanese Consulate General regarding this case." When asked if the matter had been resolved, Mr. Porter replied that no decision had been made regarding further action. A Japanese spokesperson, in speaking to reporters, had twice flatly denied Miss Donaldson's claim that she was assaulted by a Japanese sentry on the Sichuan Road Bridge. However, the Japanese naval officers stated during yesterday's apology that, in order to prevent such incidents from recurring in the future, English notices would be posted on the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, advising pedestrians to keep to the left. It is reported that Miss Donaldson is a buyer for an American department store, has an office in the Hamilton House, and also resides there. Furthermore, according to the "Shanghai Times," the Japanese Consulate General issued a statement last night saying, "U.S. Acting Consul General Lockhart sent a letter to Japanese Consul General Miura on December 28 regarding the Donaldson case. On December 30, Miura requested U.S. Consul General Gauss to provide detailed reports necessary for a thorough investigation, and received a reply on January 4. The Japanese authorities then conducted a detailed investigation, the results of which have been communicated by Miura to the U.S. Consul General today. It is believed that this matter will be resolved by the explanations in the letter."

### Commercial Press: Employee Subsidies Resolved; Representatives Return to Shanghai from Hong Kong

All employees of the Commercial Press, due to soaring prices, had previously submitted a request to the company through the union for subsidies and other demands. Representatives were dispatched in response to a telegram from General Manager Wang in Hong Kong. The representatives have now returned to Shanghai. It is reported that after several frank negotiations, both labor and management have decided to share the difficulties, and the matter has been resolved.

### Japanese Forcibly Seizing Inland Wheat: Flour Mills Struggle to Operate; Closure Feared After Inventory Depleted; Australian and American Wheat Prices Soar

According to the "Continental Daily," a Chinese flour mill owner told a reporter yesterday (the 18th) that no wheat is being transported from inland areas, and since the outbreak of the European war, the prices of Australian and American wheat have soared, putting local flour mills in a critical situation. Only a quarter of the machines are working, and closure is feared after the inventory is depleted. The mill owner did not explicitly state why no wheat is being transported, but rumors of Japanese people doing their utmost to forcibly seize wheat have been confirmed. The mill owner continued, saying that Shanghai has enough wheat to last about five months. If the situation does not change by then, the flour mills will be unable to continue operating. The high prices of Australian and American wheat are due to the low exchange rate and high freight costs. The poor harvest in the United States may cause the price of American wheat to rise from the current one U.S. dollar per bushel to three dollars. However, it is reported that 20,000 tons of Australian wheat have already been shipped to Shanghai this month, and more purchases will be made soon. Most of China's imported wheat comes from Australia. Normally, Shanghai factories start purchasing Australian wheat around October when the domestic wheat supply runs low. However, this year, due to the low exchange rate, purchases started as early as January.

In 1938, local flour mills gradually recovered after the war, making every effort to clear their inventory. The amount of foreign wheat imported into China that year was only 1,700 kilograms. However, last year, due to the lack of domestic wheat, foreign wheat was purchased. As a result, customs figures show that 467,083,500 kilograms of foreign wheat were imported, of which 296,721,400 kilograms came from Australia. In the first half of last year, 70% of the wheat imported into China came from Australia.

### Wusong: Bomb Explosion Kills Three Road Workers; Two Others Seriously Injured

Japanese troops stationed at Zhanghuabang in Wusong have recently been building roads in the area, starting from Zhanghuabang, passing west of Haoqiaobin, north to Zhoujiaqiao, turning west along Yunzaobin, passing Jijiabin, and reaching Luodian and Nanxiang. Residents of Haoqiaozhai on the west side of Haoqiao and Xiaoxujia Lane and Zhoujiabangzhai north of Haoqiao have been evicted by the Hengchan Company. The land is priced at 40 yuan per square meter, and the houses are valued at the discretion of the Hengchan Company. Residents are powerless to resist, although they are angry but dare not speak out. A few days ago, five road workers, all from out of town, were working on the west side of Haoqiao. Because of the cold weather, they moved some burnt coke and dug a hole to burn it for warmth. As the five workers were huddled around the fire, a bomb hidden in the soil was detonated by the heat. A loud explosion occurred, killing three workers on the spot. Another worker suffered serious injuries to his shoulders, chest, and abdomen, and his life is in danger. The remaining worker suffered an injury to his right foot, which may result in permanent disability, but his life may be saved.

### Yangtze River Water Level Plummets: Japanese Vessels Stop at Wuhu; Small Boats Used for Transportation Between Wuhu and Huangshigang; Additional Barges Required from Huangshigang to Hankou

The water level of the Yangtze River inevitably decreases every winter, making it difficult for river vessels to navigate. Since the withdrawal of the National Army to the west, the entire Yangtze River line below Hankou has been controlled by the Japanese Navy, and foreign vessels have been excluded from shipping, with Japanese vessels exclusively enjoying the benefits. According to shipping news, the Yangtze River water level has sharply decreased this winter, especially in the Huangshigang section, where the water depth is only six feet. Vessels of the East Asia Shipping Company (formerly the Japanese Qing Company) can no longer reach Hankou, with larger vessels stopping at Wuhu. Small river vessels previously operating on the Sichuan-Hunan route, such as the Yunyang Maru, Dangyang Maru, Yiyang Maru, and Shallow Water, are being used to transport cargo between Wuhu and Huangshigang. However, from Huangshigang to Hankou, additional barges are required for transshipment, with small tugboats towing them to Hankou. Based on the above situation, the shallow depth of the Yangtze River this winter is evident.

### Wusong Estuary: Rampant Pirates; Fish Vendors Carrying Full Loads; Pirates Covet

The sea off the Wusong estuary has recently seen frequent pirate activity, with robberies and looting occurring from time to time. On the 10th of this month, a fish boat named "Shi Yuanxing" from Shenjiamen, Dinghai, manned by Zhang Xiaogen and his son Zhang Mingbiao, set off from Shenjiamen to Songshan to purchase iced hairtail for transport to Shanghai for sale at the "Fish Market." The next day, while loaded with cigarettes, matches, and goods from the north and south, it was returning to Shenjiamen when it encountered a pirate ship off the Yushan waters of Wusong and was robbed. On the morning of the 14th, another transport ship from Shenjiamen encountered robbers in the Tongsha waters and suffered losses of over 4,000 yuan. Furthermore, as the hairtail season is coming to an end, fishing boats are carrying New Year's goods back to their hometowns, making them targets for pirates. Recently, pirates have also been rampant in the Putuo waters, Huangdayang, and Shengsi waters.

### American Rescue Ship: Sails to Manila; Encountered Typhoon in Qingdao Last Year; Undergoing Minor Repairs in Shanghai Shipyard

According to the "Continental Daily," the U.S. submarine rescue ship "Pigeon," which ran aground in Qingdao during a typhoon in early September last year, is still undergoing repairs at the Woofung Machinery Factory shipyard in Shanghai and is scheduled to sail to Manila early next week. It is reported that the "Pigeon" underwent temporary repairs in Qingdao after running aground, and was subsequently towed to Shanghai by the U.S. destroyer "Widgeon." It entered the shipyard on November 14 of last year for repairs to its hull and engine, costing 500 yuan. After arriving in Manila in early February, it may enter a government-managed shipyard for final repairs.

### Ma Xiangbo Memorial Service: Order of Service Scheduled

Ma Xiangbo was highly respected. Since his death in Liangshan, both Chinese and foreigners have mourned him. Various circles in Shanghai have scheduled a memorial service to be held at the Huzhou Guild Hall on Guizhou Road at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month. The preparatory office of the Pudong Association building, as the date is approaching, has been actively preparing for the event. The order of service for the memorial service is as follows: (1) Play mournful music; (2) Opening remarks; (3) Memorial ceremony: 1. The presiding officer takes his place; 2.

Three bows; (4) Sing a memorial song; (5) Report on his life story; (6) Deliver condolences; (7) Discuss permanent memorial plans; (8) Family members give thanks; (9) Play mournful music; (10) End of ceremony.

### Zhenhai Port: Japanese Ships Withdrawn

The four Japanese ships outside Zhenhai Port, off Liaobiaozui, sailed away last night. However, the Zhenhai Fortress defense forces remain on high alert. Order in Ningbo is as usual. Residents of Longshan, Xiepu, and Guanhaiwei in Cibei, where shells fell, are calm and orderly, and they have evacuated as ordered to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.

### Loyal Righteous Army Undergoing Reorganization: Strength Increasing; Puppet Troops in Nanshi Disarmed; Remaining Puppet Troops Panicked

The Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army in the suburbs of Shanghai, after He Xingjian's betrayal and death, has been reorganized by central government officials, and commanders of various brigades with pure intentions have been promoted. Currently, in the suburbs of Shanghai, such as Pudong, western Shanghai, Baoshan, and Songjiang, there are configurations of "X" detachments. Each detachment has three brigades, its strength equivalent to the momentum of ten regular army regiments. During the recent winter offensive, these troops have advanced on all sides. The troops of various buffer forces such as Ding, Fan, and Xu have defected upon hearing the news, and Ding, Fan, and Xu themselves have hidden and dare not return to their defense positions. It is reported that the puppet "Peace National Salvation Army" has also changed its name to the puppet "Peace National Construction Army." However, generally, bandits in Pudong who adopted this name were ordered to move to Nanshi. Upon arriving in Nanshi, they were all disarmed and disbanded by the Japanese forces.

### Siberian High Pressure: Minimal Impact on Shanghai; Advancing Southeast to Invade the Eastern Four Provinces; Shanghai Sky Overcast, No Sign of Snow

Yesterday's weather in Shanghai was slightly affected by the Siberian high pressure, becoming relatively colder. The climate will continue to turn colder today and tomorrow. The Datong News Agency reporter provides the following details:

High Pressure Moving Southeast

According to the Xujiahui Observatory, a high-pressure system has formed in Siberia, causing a sharp drop in temperature to minus 47 degrees Celsius. The climate in Vladivostok is also only minus 19 degrees Celsius. Although the climate in Tianjin and Beijing is also slightly affected by the Siberian high pressure, the minimum temperature is around minus 7 degrees Celsius.

Shanghai Not Directly Affected

Because the Siberian high pressure is currently moving southeast and not south-southeast, the area affected will be the Eastern Four Provinces. Shanghai can avoid being affected. Although the temperature seemed slightly lower yesterday, the minimum was still 3.1 degrees Celsius (37.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and the maximum was 7.2 degrees Celsius (45 degrees Fahrenheit). Therefore, the impact is minimal.

Difficult to Predict Snowy Weather

According to the observatory's prediction, the weather in Shanghai will continue to turn colder today and tomorrow, but it will not reach an extremely cold level. Although the sky was overcast yesterday, giving the impression that snow was brewing, the weather reports from all over the country show no snowfall. Therefore, it is inferred that Shanghai is unlikely to see falling snow. If so, the fields will see an increase in pests, which will affect the spring planting and be detrimental to health.

### Wan Yu Sauce Garden: Manager Embezzles Funds; Sentenced to One Year and Two Months in Prison

Pu Qudan (50 years old), from Jiading, was the manager of Wan Yu Sauce Garden at No. 190 Marlang Road in the French Concession. Recently, he was discovered by the owner, Shen Shuyi, to have embezzled over 10,000 yuan from the store's accounts. On December 24 of last year, Shen reported the crime to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Pu. At the time of his arrest, Pu was caught smoking opium in bed. The detectives brought the smoking paraphernalia to the police station and sent it to the Second Special Court for detention and interrogation. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. The case was continued yesterday by Judge Sun Pengxian of the Criminal Division of the court. The police attorney, Gu Shouxi, stated that the plaintiff had commissioned an accountant to investigate, and the result showed that the total amount embezzled was 29,880 yuan. Furthermore, the defendant was also guilty of opium addiction, so he was prosecuted for embezzlement and opium addiction. When interrogated, the defendant confessed that he had worked at the store for over 20 years and was burdened by family responsibilities after the war. He admitted to embezzling over 10,000 yuan from the store, but he was evasive about the rest. The court verified the confession and ordered a debate. The judge declared that the case was clear and immediately announced the verdict: Pu Qudan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for embezzlement and eight months of imprisonment for opium addiction, to be served concurrently for a total of one year and two months, with deprivation of public rights for one year. The civil lawsuit portion was transferred to the Civil Division.

### Chauffeur Sentenced in Drug Case Appeals

Chauffeur Zhang Zhengquan was driving his own car, No. 4734, in the spring of the year before last when he was stopped at the intersection of Julaida Road and Edward Road. French police detectives found over 100 taels of morphine in the car and arrested Zhang and impounded the car. Zhang claimed that the car owner was Zhu Ziyao, a wealthy real estate merchant living in Jing'an Villa, and that the drugs belonged to a Mr. Zhang at No. 36 Guba New Village, Guba Road. However, car owner Zhu Ziyao has avoided arrest since the incident. The initial trial resulted in Zhang Zhengquan being sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment and the car being confiscated. Zhang appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which reduced the sentence to seven years. However, Zhang and the car owner were still dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court in the hope of getting the car back. As a result, the case was sent back for retrial. The case was concluded yesterday by a collegial panel of the Third Branch of the High Court, presided over by Acting Judge Chen Huoqich, along with Judges Wang and Gu. The court announced that the verdict would be announced on a scheduled date and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.

### Robbery Cases

### Social Miscellany

Acting on a tip from an informant, the French police raided No. 86, Xintangjia Lane, Fujian Road, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday and arrested 27 men and women for smoking heroin. They were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday, where Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial and ordered them to be remanded in custody pending judgment.

Tian Deming and Zhang Lishi from Shandong were found to be in possession of over 150 yuan in counterfeit currency in Room 10 of the Jinjiang Inn on Shandong Road on the 4th of this month. Detectives from the Jing'an Temple police station discovered this and secretly arrested the two defendants, who were sent to the First Special Court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao delivered the judgment: Tian Deming and Zhang Lishi were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment for jointly intending to use and possessing counterfeit currency. The 150 yuan in counterfeit currency from the Central Bank was confiscated.

At 2:05 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the Shu Xinzhai Incense and Candle Shop at No. 273, Avenue Minthé in the French Concession. Upon receiving the news, the Central Fire Brigade immediately dispatched vehicles to extinguish the fire. The fire was extinguished at 4:30 PM. The fire was started by Xu Ronggen, a tenant on the upper floor, because he was processing cotton and sparks flew into the cotton, causing the entire upper floor to be burned. Fortunately, it was during the day, and no one was injured.

Fan Qiuzhuang, a 45-year-old man from Chongming, lived at No. 14 Tangjiabang, Yinxiang Port, and made a living by growing vegetables. At 10:30 PM the night before last, two thugs broke into his home while he was sleeping and stabbed him 14 times with knives.

### New Contribution to the Textile Industry

"Canvas" is the raw material for the hand embroidery industry, which used to be imported from Germany. After the embroidery shops added embroidered flowers, they were sold to Europe and the United States. There are already more than 20 embroidery factories in Shanghai alone, with a total of over 10,000 female workers. With the outbreak of the European war, this German "Canvas" could no longer be transported, so over 10,000 female workers in Shanghai were about to lose their jobs. Recently, Lai Hongda and others from the Datong Weaving Factory in Yongting Village, Caojiabo, have used decades of experience and knowledge to conduct careful research, spending half a year and millions of dollars, and have finally achieved success. The quality of their product surpasses that of imported goods, so various factories are competing to order it. Currently, the factory has a large demand and is preparing to expand.

### Case of Extortion Against Silk Merchants: One Suspect Apprehended; Handwriting Comparison Reveals Similar Numerals; Suspect Denies All Knowledge of Extortion

Ye Yonghui, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 5 Qipu Road and operating a silk store, received three threatening letters from a criminal gang between the 3rd and 12th of this month, demanding 250,000 yuan or they would resort to drastic measures and endanger his life.  Shanghai Concession Police Force Detectives Shang Wu, Huang Fusen, and Shen Dehui apprehended a Shaoxing native named Tong Zhengchu (45 years old, an actor in the Shaoxing opera troupe at the Great World amusement center) in Room 422 of the Far East Hotel on Chatham Road, the suspected perpetrator in this case. He was escorted to the First Special District Court for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi from the Criminal Third Tribunal continued the trial. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that a postponement was required. He requested that the defendant write three sheets of handwriting in the police station for comparison. The writing samples matched similar numerals in the second threatening letter. However, the defendant continued to deny any involvement and requested another adjournment. The three sheets of handwriting written by the defendant were presented to the court. Tong Zhengchu testified that he had been performing at the Great World for four years. At the time of his arrest, he was at Room 422 of the Far East Hotel, a company room opened by his colleague Yang Weixin, an investigator at the Great World and friends, gathered for mahjong to pass the time before being arrested by the police. He claimed to have no knowledge of the threatening letters and pleaded for leniency, hiring lawyers Yan Gang and Yu Enliang for his defense. Subsequently, Yang Weixin, a Suzhou native and investigator at the Great World, testified that he had instructed him to go to the Far East Hotel Room 422 to play mahjong, which he did. Judge Yu ordered him remanded in custody for further investigation in seven days.

### Tongrenhe Paint Store: Manager's Resignation Issue; Allegations of Embezzlement Previously Resolved; Manager Asserts Invalidity and Files Lawsuit

The Tongrenhe Paint Store at No. 80 Min’guo Road in the French Concession is a business jointly established by members of the Yun family clan from Suzhou, with a history of sixty to seventy years. The shareholders appointed Xu Chengxun from Yuyao as the manager. In September of last year, Yun Huai’gao and other Yun family shareholders had a dispute with Manager Xu regarding sales. After auditing the accounts, irregularities were suspected and Manager Xu was suspected of

embezzlement.

On December 30th of last year, the shareholders appointed representatives to report the matter to the French Concession Police and suspended the accounting books. Both parties commissioned lawyers to negotiate a settlement. Xu submitted a letter to the shareholders declaring his resignation and waiving his profit share, requesting exemption from investigation into the sales dispute and outstanding accounts, to resolve the matter. On the 7th of this month, Xu Chengxun suddenly commissioned a lawyer to publish a statement declaring the previous letter invalid. The shareholders also commissioned a lawyer to publish a rebuttal. Xu then filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, seeking confirmation that the letter was invalid. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Ziguan opened the Fourth Civil Tribunal to

summon both parties

for trial. Both parties sent representatives. The plaintiff, Xu Chengxun, was represented by lawyer Gao Danhua, who stated the reasons for requesting confirmation that the letter was invalid, claiming that Xu had been ill for many years, and had been recuperating for two to three years, submitting numerous medical prescriptions as evidence. He also stated that although the letter was certified by Xu's appointed lawyer, Xu Wufang, Xu himself claimed that he had not certified it. The defendant, Yun Huai’gao, was represented by lawyer Xu Jie, who argued that on September 2nd of last year, due to the outbreak of the European war, it was difficult to export goods to the Defu Foreign Firm. Xu was notified to temporarily suspend sales to prevent hoarding and speculation. Although Xu agreed, on September 11th it was discovered that he had

sold a large quantity.

The accounts recorded were all unfamiliar customer names, and there were no delivery receipts. After someone reported the matter, an audit was conducted, and Xu was deemed to be highly suspect. The matter was reported to the police for investigation. Before the account books were delivered and Yun Huai’gao's indictment was completed, Xu entrusted lawyer Xu Wufang to represent him and requested a settlement with Yun’s representative lawyer Qiu Fenling. He voluntarily resigned from his position as manager and was willing to compensate 50,000 yuan for the sales dispute, using his profit share as compensation. The amount of the profit share and the extent of the sales dispute damage were discussed. Xu was willing to treat the profit share and the damage from the sales dispute

as mutually settled.

He also requested the remission of 2,000 yuan in outstanding accounts. Xu issued a letter, certified by lawyer Xu Wufang. Because Xu requested funds for returning to his hometown for recuperation, the shareholders issued a promissory note for 10,000 yuan. The special remuneration was not fixed; in the past, it was to offset Xu’s excessive debts, nominally called special remuneration. At that time, Xu was eating fried rice with eggs and watermelon seeds in the police station. According to his newspaper advertisement, he received a letter from his father in the police station, indicating that he was very free and fully considered the matter. Xu had no objections. Only after many days did he publish a denial and renege on the agreement, which was unreasonable. He requested that the plaintiff’s lawsuit be dismissed. The court reviewed the facts and ordered witnesses and the plaintiff to be summoned to court for questioning, rescheduling the hearing for the 30th for further review.

### Rampant Robbery in Pudong

Since the beginning of winter, robbery has been rampant in Pudong. Barehanded fake police officers have no security capabilities. Yesterday morning around 1 a.m., in the Tiandu area, bandits robbed eleven civilian households in a row. The victims included Xu Afang at No. 28 Tiandu Li, and his neighbors Zhuang Maomao, and Yang’s residence Yang Along, Yang Chongming, Yang Weimin, Yang Genbao, Yang Yu’mai, Yang Zhuangfa, Zhao Zhiming, Cao Asan, Chen Songlin, and other households. Money, jewelry, clothing, and bedding were all looted, with a total loss of two to three thousand yuan.

### Food: Flour Prices Continue to Soar; Mills Cite Raw Material Issues, Intending to Hoard; Foreign Flour Available but Not Obtainable

Flour

Yesterday, the No. 2 Flour Mill held firm at the original price of ten yuan, limiting supply and remaining strict. Each mill stated that the current raw material problem was not resolved temporarily. Domestic wheat was unreliable. Ordering foreign wheat lacked shipping space. Transactions were difficult. Although the flour inventory was ample, the mills were unwilling to sell easily due to the large profit margin and unwilling to increase production. Buyer bids have been suspended for several days. Only a few merchant single flours were being traded in the market in small batches on this street. It was heard that the selling price of Chechuan brand flour had risen sharply from ten yuan and nine jiao or nine jiao half to a peak of eleven yuan and four jiao or eleven yuan and five jiao, a surge of five or six jiao compared to the previous day, which was alarming. This was all incited by those restricting supplies. In the foreign flour market, after continuous speculator activity, holders took advantage of the opportunity to hoard. Although the market price was eleven yuan and five or six jiao, there were few available stocks. Compared with domestic flour, it was still cheaper. This situation was all created by a major mill. It was stated that if foreign flour was exhausted, they could manipulate the market freely with the largest scale of production. Trading in domestic flour was limited to about 10,000 bags of small batches on this street. The trading volume of foreign flour was also only two to three thousand bags.

Wheat

The wheat market has become increasingly brisk recently. Amid serious rumors of rising flour prices, holders naturally regarded their goods as a rare commodity. Therefore, those offering samples for sale on the market could be described as disappearing without a trace. Each mill stated that although there was a need for raw materials currently, there were no large quantities of goods available at high prices. It was heard that the Fuxin and Fufeng Mills had previously ordered Australian foreign wheat, one ship each, which would arrive in Shanghai before the lunar new year, at which time the market might change slightly. The current market trend has become difficult to curb. Yesterday, the selling price of wheat was 18 yuan and 5 jiao. Some buyers absorbed the supply, while the sellers then raised the price to 19 yuan. The two sides then reached an impasse.

### Rice Merchants' Desire to Manipulate Remains Undiminished; New Year Sales Season Brings More Speculation; Wuxi Rice Prices Also Manipulated

Rice market transactions are changing. Various rices have returned to high prices because the supply from the interior is not large. Furthermore, there are many twists and turns in transferring out of the Hongkou district. Few are transported to the concession for listing. For foreign rice, owners are unwilling to easily sell due to silver prices. Coupled with soaring flour prices, the equivalent weight calculation greatly exceeds the rice price. Rice merchants and hoarders feel there are more opportunities to take. Customers are preparing for the new spring year and must purchase goods, so sales are more robust. At the beginning of the market, there were still returned goods for mutual transfer, and the situation was still stable. Later, they had to purchase from the original customer vendors, and the price was increasing, so the sales situation became more lively. In addition to the native shop , most of the inland merchants were willing to sell in bulk. At this point, each price for thick or thin, japonica, early rice, and white rice increased by 4 or 5 jiao, and Saigon and other foreign rice increased by 6 or 7 jiao. Until nearly noon, there were more who took advantage of the high prices to return. The price also fell back by 1 to 3 jiao. Therefore, the price of domestic and foreign rice increased by 4 jiao compared to the previous. The closing price for No. 1 Saigon was 38 yuan and 1 jiao, 38 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 37 yuan and 3 jiao, 37 yuan, and Fired Rice 37 yuan, 1 or 2 jiao. Statistics showed that no less than 20,000 bags were sold throughout the city. This was one of the most robust days of sales during the week.

After the opening of the foreign rice market in the morning, the clients' appetites were greedy, and the overseas pricing also increased. The difference between Nos. 1 and 2 was nearly one yuan, making it even more difficult to reconcile. Even the broken rice telegram showed a good return of 2 jiao. The previously scheduled 33-yuan broken rice had to be at 33 yuan and 3 jiao to continue. There was a deal for about 1,000 tons of each. The market's current supply is also tight, and it is 3, 4, or 5 jiao greater than the previous market.

Yesterday, another 3,491 bags of foreign rice arrived from the Taikoo Company Jiangsu Yu from Hong Kong and unloaded at the French Concession Main Warehouse.

Rice and grain without pots are still prohibited from leaving the country. The selling price of high-quality goods is 20 yuan and 5 jiao per stone. With the Lunar New Year approaching, farmers need money and are selling in scattered quantities in urban and rural areas. Sources arriving from various routes are also very enthusiastic, but prices are being manipulated by both merchants and customers, making it difficult to expect a fallback.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Rebounds; Most Losses Recovered

The stock market situation yesterday confirmed that the rumors spread the previous day were unfounded. The market mentality suddenly turned stable. With the absorption of each gang, market prices gradually rose. Most of the losses from the previous day were recovered. Among them, Types A and D were even higher than the previous day due to supply not meeting demand. Type A was drawing near the lottery, which was drawing as many as twenty-six signs. Type D attracted much attention because the market price was lower. With the interest payment period approaching, the prospect should still have a good market. There were more transactions yesterday morning. Runli Tongshen absorbed as much as possible in the sell-off of Jiufeng and Dafeng. The market rose in a natural state. Later, because Xinfu and No. 20 were still in great need, there were few sellers, and the price was more firm. Hengfu Tongkang frequently moved in and out. Gongmao and Shunkang focused on Types D and E. In the afternoon, Defu and No. 40 had a strong appetite, and Lianhe Tongkang sold slightly. There were few transactions. Throughout the day, most of the retail investors were long rather than short. The market price ended with a return of 1.5 to 5.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

The silver balance tax revealed a rise of 2 points. After that, the foreign bank community had some scattered settlements. It softened slightly. The American exchange made 7.9375.

### Gold Market Re-Enters Weary Path

Yesterday, the dark market for cash scorched earth, although it had rebounded the previous day, had returned to be powerless and downward. It returned to the weary state, in a single defeat. It only closed at a low price that day because the rumors in the market the previous day had no basis and were difficult to believe. The foreign exchange hardened. The Hong Kong help's actual needs were also not smooth, so the market mentality was volatile. The selling wind stayed for a long time, so it was not easy to dissipate. In the morning, the market mentality turned soft. There was much selling intent. The silver floor help sought to sell, and buyers watched carefully. Therefore, the opening price fell by 10 yuan to 4070 yuan. The market price was lowered again by 15 yuan during sparse transactions. Because the Hong Kong help saw the cheapness, they pounced on it, so the falling wind was slightly stable. At 11 o'clock, the exchange market reported loosening, and the buyers retreated. It fell to 4048 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the exchange market was quiet, and ups and downs were even more plain. Only the initial opening was raised several yuan because a certain securities company searched for it, but after entering it suddenly reverted. Therefore, it was finally reduced to 4045 yuan at the close, down 35 yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day's transactions were light. Silver floor ornaments were unchanged. Customs gold was still flat.

Scorched Earth Little 35 Yuan

Since the morning, the (ten taels) opening was because the rumors from the previous day were unfounded, and the exchange market was quite fixed, so the market mentality turned to selling intent. The silver floor help was the first to agree to supply, but the buying appetite was extremely weak, causing the opening to fall by 10 yuan. The silver floor help sold to the gold company for 20 taels for 4070 yuan. In a short time, the money exchange also followed and spat it out, continuing to fall by 10 yuan. The money exchange industry sold to the gold company for 20 taels for 4060 yuan. Later, a certain silver bank and a certain securities help absorbed it and returned 8 yuan. The silver floor help entered the securities help 20 taels for 4068 yuan. After this, another securities help continued to come out , and the cash company supply was not small. Although the Hong Kong help had come to buy it, the head position still felt the unevenness of the request, so after a short time it again 12 yuan. The securities help spat out to the money exchange industry 20 taels for 4055 yuan. At that time, a certain securities help came to drag it in again, once returning to 5 yuan. However, after the exchange market reported loosening, sellers poured in, and a certain two money exchange industries competed to block, and scattered households also had a strong selling intent, causing it to decline again. Soon after, a silver bank sold to the silver floor help 10 taels for 4045 yuan, the silver bank suddenly made another customer grab it, raising 3 yuan, entering the securities help 10 taels, taking 4048 yuan as the afternoon close price. In the afternoon, the securities help first came to buy in, and at that time the sellers watched, and the opening was high at 7 yuan. The silver floor help gave the securities help 10 taels for 4055 yuan. Later, the gold company saw a high sell-off, so it pressed down 8 yuan, the gold company sold to the money exchange industry 10 taels for 4047 yuan. Then, a certain silver bank slightly came to grab it, raising 5 yuan again, the gold company entered the securities help 20 taels for 4052 yuan. A person who suddenly came to return again, the securities help took out 7 yuan, the money exchange industry gave the securities help 20 taels for 4045 yuan as the late close price.

The cash number's selling price of the standard gold was several yuan higher, the herding decreased by 20 yuan, and the current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, so they all rarely did open.

British and American gold bills surged in supply and sharply decreased in price. Early in the morning, the American gold bill fell to 12 yuan and 4 jiao and 3 fen.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Remains Depressed as Before

The yarn market is still ordinary and without highlights. The near new year, increased inventory, and the customer's practical needs are all factors that make the market depressed. The market transactions are stagnant and very scattered.

The yarn price fell because the rumours of the previous afternoon were all castles in the air. The doubts have been dispelled. There were more bulls in the field, but there were very few buyers. The opening price of 20s Double Horse was 726 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers were very few.

### Piece Goods: Domestic Sales of Cotton Cloth Are Diminished.

Sales of cotton cloth to foreign, Hong Kong, and Nanyang are smooth and active. Only domestic sales have shrunk. As the end of the year approaches, customers are getting tight on silver. Therefore, although the mill increased prices, profit on selling by hand at a low price is not few. There are great differences in the market, and the difference is 1 jiao to 5 jiao. Yesterday's market price was level. Yihua, Huaxin, Zhenzhong, and other manufacturers' coarse and fine cloth were opened for 2,000 pieces. The current price is half a jiao to five jiao higher.

### The Sugar Market: It's Difficult for Diaoqing to Increase

### Coal

Coal Balls Rise Again, Association Resolves to Increase by Four Dollars

Due to competition among businesses at the beginning of the month, coal ball businesses experienced a price drop and dumping, leading to market chaos and inconsistent factory prices. Recently, due to the increased cost of raw materials from Hongji sawdust, the industry association yesterday resolved to increase factory prices by four dollars, effective immediately. Specifically, Yitai, Xingnan, Nanyang, and Guohua coal ball companies will charge eighty dollars per ton, self-pickup, plus two dollars for delivery by cart. Retail price at shops is four dollars and forty cents per load.

### Silk and Tea

Silk Market in Transition

Yesterday, the silk market saw mixed ups and downs. Spot prices in New York were already recovering. Raw silk prices varied by fractions of cents. Shanghai silk rose by six cents, while near-term exchange sales rose but long-term prices fell by one and a half cents. Yokohama spot prices rose by ten yuan in the morning and sixty-five yuan in the afternoon, while long-term prices fell by fifteen cents and then rose by seventy-five yuan in the afternoon. The future of the silk market remains uncertain. The price surge a month ago lacked a solid foundation, and the current severe drop is not due to relaxed supply and demand. The main reason is the changing political climate in Japan and the shifts in Japanese-American business relations. Therefore, the future of the silk market will continue to change along with international relations. The silk market in this port is not experiencing excessive panic due to the prosperous business of the previous year. However, the price of silk has indeed fallen drastically. Yesterday, the market in this port seemed slightly more stable. White silk "B" grade 7 or 8 is still selling for five thousand yuan. Xinfu and others have imported ten loads, while French firms are offering prices as low as four thousand nine hundred yuan, which is still unsellable. Indian silk prices are not dropping as severely because of shortages of both domestic and international stocks, but transactions are difficult to complete.

### Covering One's Ears While Stealing a Bell

— Huang Jiayin

All lawbreakers, regardless of who they are, are immediately thrown into high-walled, heavily guarded prisons. This may be the simplest way to deal with "social criminals," but it is not the most civilized, reasonable, or appropriate method.

Modern psychology, criminology, and sociology have all advanced. We know that most criminals are driven by environmental temptations and pressures. Some commit crimes due to improper education, bad habits, or physical ailments. Only a very small number of people break the law due to hereditary defects.

For those who are tempted and pressured by their environment, we should change their environment. For those who are improperly educated or uneducated, we should provide them with correct education. For those with bad habits, we should help them change those habits. And for those with physical ailments, we should treat their conditions. If we continue to indiscriminately lock up all "social criminals" together, and release them after their "sentence is served," leaving them to fend for themselves afterwards, isn't this like covering one's ears while stealing a bell? No wonder prisons are overcrowded!

For criminals, we should use scientific methods to analyze, study, and treat each case as a symptom of an illness.

As the times progress, our methods of dealing with criminals should also advance!

### Wartime Berlin in Correspondence  Donglin

It has been three or four months since the war began. The most worrying thing in Berlin is the lack of food. Pork and beef are completely unavailable, with only venison, wild boar, and wild duck. These are hunted from hunting areas and forests. However, for the average person, these are not only unappetizing, but also frighteningly expensive.

Housewives spend hours every day queuing to buy food. If a guest arrives and doesn't bring food, they will simply have to go home hungry. Most Berlin residents return home before dark and sit under lights that don't leak light. It's too dangerous to go outside.

Germans can only get one bar of soap per month, so there isn't enough soap to shave with, leading to most men having full beards. Interestingly, the Hitler Youth League recently stipulated that kissing men with full beards should not be refused.

The import tax has increased by 50%, the cigarette tax by 20%, and the beer tax by 14%. Therefore, Berliners can't afford foreign goods, and even cigarettes and beer are becoming unaffordable.

The war has also greatly affected the business of prostitutes. Because men are not happy to go out on dark streets after dark, and most of the strong men have gone to the battlefield.

Radio stations have no fixed programs to broadcast. All that is broadcast is government reports, talks to strengthen combat awareness, and propaganda, interspersed with marches and classical music.

Newspapers have been reduced by half, and all newspapers are filled with the same news. The content is nothing more than formulaic government announcements, comments on Germany from countries maintaining friendly relations, and articles attacking Britain. They only treat Britain as a mortal enemy, and don't say much bad about France.

There is also a shortage of clothing and food. Men are only allowed to have two suits, four undershirts, and six pairs of socks. If you want to buy new ones, you have to bring the old ones.

The abuse of Jews is getting worse every day. Everyone is worried that other foreigners will face the same treatment in the near future.

The people of Germany are silent, with sad expressions on their faces. They don't seem enthusiastic about the war, and they don't like to talk about it. When they meet on the street or in public places, they just greet each other listlessly.

A Frightened Bird  Meng Gu

On a street in London, the sound of thunder startled a woman who screamed.

A mischievous child by the roadside blurted out, "Madam, don't be afraid, it's not Hitler, it's God."

Cultivation in Leisure Time  K

The meaning of publishing this article is not to advocate leisure, but to advocate the cultivation of leisure. We feel that leisure is a right that every living person should have, and that the cultivation of leisure is an art of life.

— Editor

There are two kinds of people in the world who are most pitiful: those who are busy from morning to night, and those who are busy with nothing to do day and night. Neither of them has the opportunity to enjoy the happiness of leisure. Leisure is different from laziness: laziness is not doing what should be done, which is a dereliction of duty; leisure is the remaining free time after the things that should be done are finished. How to use this remaining time is the source of happiness or pain in life.

Enjoying leisure is not an easy task, but you should try it, because without it, you have no other way to seek a kind of cultivation, to generate an energy in life to cope with difficult undertakings; you have no other way to gently tap the source of spirit, in other words, you must first obtain a kind of wisdom in non-action before you can act.

Watching movies, dancing, playing golf, and taking car rides in one's spare time are not true enjoyment of leisure. The conditions for true leisure are very simple: to relax tense muscles, to stop thinking about doing something, and to temporarily become a maple leaf floating in the wind, or a stone. You must exchange the cultural person's planned activities, planned thoughts, and all the habits that make people tired for spiritual ease and freedom. In short, you must do nothing. When you learn this, your realm of consciousness will open up a new world, with a peace and clarity of mind and body that you have never had before. This realm has an incomparable power to revive the spirit from fatigue.

If you are wearing glasses, take them off, as even that slight pressure on the bridge of your nose is enough to cause distress. You should also loosen your belt and tie, then lie down and rest. Don't think about anything, let your spirit rise. On your newly liberated consciousness will immediately arise a kind of semi-clear and semi-obscure thought, various memories and awakenings will also surge forth, because the suppression of your thoughts and the suppression of your actions have now been defeated, and your spirit has the opportunity to appreciate the fragrance of flowers in a bottle. This fragrance has already permeated the room, but because your spirit is not free, you have not been able to obtain it. An easy-going spirit has a mysterious sense of power, and this fragrance will be deeply inhaled into the lungs, and there will be another feeling, that the sun is shining on your hands. At that point, with your nostrils full of the fragrance of flowers and your skin feeling the sunshine, the world is not so bad after all. You have finally entered a lovely and secret realm, which only those who understand the cultivation of leisure can enter. Returning to this peaceful and quiet life is a cultivation worth learning.

Random Notes: Spider Webs  Pinpin

In the corners of the room, under the table, at the head of the bed, and by the cabinet, spiders have spun webs. The spider squats in the center of the web, with its rear end facing the sky, not moving an inch. The shape of the web is a geometric circle, swaying gently in the wind, like a kite, but it is often hung with a few scattered specks of dust.

I am a person who hates spider webs very much. I don't know what inspiration King Alfred received from spider webs to learn a lesson, but I think this is probably just a legend. No one in the world likes this dirty and ugly thing.

Needless to say, spider webs are dirty. A perfectly clean room, with a web hanging here and a net spun there, clinging to dust, in strings and balls, the room has many sores, and touching it brings a handful of filth. If this thing doesn't disgust people, what else will? Brightness, like sunlight through crystal, and cleanliness, like dewdrops on lotus petals, this is the way to live. Dirt is unacceptable.

Spider webs are also ugly. Hidden in the shadows, waving in the wind, innocent little moths and insects, either inadvertently or lured by the patterns of the web, fly in and get eaten by that great demon king. The spider grows fat, fattened by eating the blood of others. If you look closely at a spider, you will be shocked. You won't believe there is another animal more bizarre than it, like an octopus, like a crab, and like a centipede—the shadow of the devil. Having spawned this strange thing, this ugly thing, can we stand by and let it run rampant?

Filthy, tempting, blood-sucking, grotesque, devilish spider webs, let us sweep them away and restore our cleanliness, freedom, happiness, and liberation!

Therefore, as soon as I see a spider web, I will burn it with fire—I feel that using a bamboo pole to poke at it is too light a punishment. I light the fire and aim at the spider's abdomen. Very quickly, before it can escape, there is a "sizzle" sound, and the spider falls headfirst, its legs crushed, its head shrunken, with only the last thin thread hanging from its tail. Thinking it could dominate one side with its fragile web, the spider finally died under the fire because of its greed. Yes, fire is a symbol of light and struggle. Without fire, the devil cannot be driven away.

O fire of light and struggle! How grateful we will be to you, because you have driven out the hateful monster and crushed it. The descendants of Prometheus should use fire to fight against the forces of darkness, just as I use fire to destroy spider webs.

Scientific Bakelite Airplane  Jieliu

Bakelite has a wide range of uses, but using it to manufacture airplanes is a new undertaking.

Ordinary metal airplanes are difficult to manufacture. First, the metal is too heavy, and second, the assembly of the airplane parts, such as rivets, is very troublesome. Therefore, a generation of aircraft manufacturers has tried using Bakelite to manufacture airplanes.

Several years ago, the United States manufactured a Bakelite airplane, which British Prime Minister Chamberlain test-flew and was very satisfied with. Recently, Mr. Clark of the United States has also built many airplanes with Bakelite frames, and the Bakelite he uses is called Duramold.

Clark's airplane has a horsepower of 400 and is made entirely of Bakelite and cloth. The fuselage is exceptionally smooth and does not have rivets all over the body like metal airplanes. The airplane's frame is fused together because Bakelite has a sticky material. Therefore, the fuselage is exceptionally strong, and because Bakelite does not burn and does not have the violent vibrations of metal, it is not easily damaged, and passengers sit comfortably inside.

It is said that it only takes two hours to manufacture the backbone of this type of Bakelite airplane, but how it is manufactured is kept highly secret by the authorities, and the outside world has no way to find out.

Clark's Bakelite airplane can carry about five passengers, and its flight speed can be increased by 7% compared to ordinary airplanes. The weight of the airplane is also smaller than ordinary airplanes, but Bakelite airplanes are still being tested and improved. If they can be manufactured on a large scale, then the current metal airplanes will inevitably be eliminated.

Show Business Starts with Yang Baosen as the Headliner, Talking About the Need for Second-Tier Lao Sheng Actors  Biyu

News from Beiping says that after returning to Ping from Shanghai, the laosheng actor Yang Baosen has decided to form his own troupe. He has already begun to assemble a cast, and his brother Yang Baozhong has therefore parted ways with Ma Lianliang and is preparing to cooperate with his brother, playing the accompanying music for Baosen. It is said that Bosen's troupe has already invited the dan actor Hu Bilan to join, and they will soon be performing in Ping.

The news about Yang Baosen forming a troupe is both joyful and sad. The joy is that Baosen will no longer have to live under someone else's roof, and the sadness is that in this situation where second-tier laosheng actors are as rare as morning stars, Baosen can be said to be a phoenix feather among them. Once he forms a troupe, there will definitely be no suitable candidates for second-tier laosheng actors.

The trend of laosheng actors forming troupes began with Ma Lianliang (during Yu Shuyan's heyday, he either cooperated with Xiao Lou or with Lanfang, and never formed his own troupe, and if he did, it was only for one or two performances). After Lianliang, Yan Jupeng rose, and later there were Li Shengzao and Tan Fuying. With the laosheng actors breaking off and forming their own troupes, dan actors were deeply afraid that no one would carry the sword, so the Four Great Dan Actors invited their own private second-tier laosheng actors, the so-called private second-tier laosheng actors, who specialized in performing plays for this one dan actor and did not join other troupes. This is what is meant by Mei and Xi Xiaobo, Cheng and Wang Shaolou, Gou and Wang Wenyuan, and Shang and Wang Fengqing. Among these four people, except for Xi Xiaobo, who also formed his own troupe because Mei did not perform, the remaining two had contracts with the dan actors and could no longer cooperate with other actors. In other words, these three had no possibility of forming a troupe, but it is precisely because of this that second-tier laosheng actors are becoming increasingly scarce.

Among today's second-tier laosheng actors, Yang Baosen is especially regarded as one of the most popular and best. Therefore, many actors invite Yang Baosen. Due to the creation of the situation, although Baosen is named a second-tier laosheng actor, his influence is no less than that of the headliner laosheng actors Xi Xiaobo, Li Shengzao, and others. Baosen's art is indeed praiseworthy, but there are not many plays that can attract audiences, so in terms of reason, Baosen should not form his own troupe at this time. In addition to Baosen, Chen Shaolin is also a leader among the second-tier laosheng actors in the north. However, Shaolin's voice is extremely narrow, causing many famous actors such as Wang Yurong and Nan Tiesheng to invite Guan Shaohua to Shanghai last time. Although he did not become popular, he is highly appreciated by the general public in the north. In addition, Shaohua has a good temper and a clever price, and has become one of the busiest second-tier laosheng actors. In addition to Shaohua, there is also Jia Shaotang, whose art is far inferior to Shaohua. Guan Dayuan is also a second-tier laosheng actor with a good reputation. Now that he has come south, one talent is invisibly missing from the second-tier laosheng actors. Chang Liheng cooperates with Huang Yulin, and although he is a second-tier laosheng actor, few northern actors invite him to cooperate. Zhang Ruting does not seem to be in Ping. Recently, Song Dezhu returned to Ping from Shanghai, and the laosheng role was filled by Ma Decheng. Ma was originally a Huang-style martial arts actor, but now he also works as a laosheng actor. The lack of talent in second-tier laosheng actors in the north can be imagined.

Show Business News: Dancer's Tears  Xiaotian

Why is it that a person who is born of the same parents is respected when she is a "Miss", while I, as a dancer, am insulted by so many people? Is she born smarter, and am I born stupid? Every time the sun sets, I just crawl out of bed and rush to the hair salon. I watch groups of students carrying their schoolbags, chatting and laughing as they run towards their homes. I think I will never enjoy this kind of happiness in this life. Their problems with food, clothing, housing, and transportation have long been arranged by their parents. If they don't know a word, they can ask their father, and if they don't understand something, they can ask their mother. If they are too lazy to do something, they can order a servant. When they are cold, hot, hungry, or sick, there is always someone caring and looking after them. What about us? We return from sitting on the cold bench in the dance hall with a belly full of anger, and our mothers cannot help but nag. But tomorrow, tomorrow we still have to go to the dance floor. Stockings must be worn, high heels must be worn, handbags must be carried, clothes must be varied, rouge and powder must be applied, hair salons must be visited, and fingernails must be manicured. These days, everything is expensive. Just buying a box of lipstick costs three to five dollars. All in all, it costs thirty to fifty dollars a month, and accompanying people for seventy to eighty or a hundred dances is just enough to cover the costs. Do you think this business is easy to do? Furthermore, if you are popular, you are busy all day long, and your legs hurt from dancing. This is all part of the job. Sometimes, when several guests call at the same time, calling for you to sit with them and calling for you to go out to dinner, it is difficult to appease all of them. Sometimes, if you are not careful and offend a guest, you will inevitably be ridiculed, cold-shouldered, etc. Maybe you will even get slapped, and you can only suffer in silence. There is also a type of person who puts on a smiling face and dances with you for free, and that's not enough. He always wants to grope you. Even if you give him what he wants, he still says that we are not worth a cent to others. Are we just born to be lowly? Some people say, if you are popular, you can save a little more money. It's hard to believe, but we can buy more jewelry and clothes, which is considered good. Mother is always the first to ask for money, and father also wants money. The siblings and brothers-in-law want the most, and the worst are the men (originally, a small half of the dancers' families were supporting men, some married, some unmarried, and some just cohabiting). We have also thought carefully about what will happen if we don't marry and when we get old and can't sell our beauty. Our own mother will die before us, and our stepmother won't care about us when we can't make money for her anymore. If we marry a rich man and become his concubine, his house is already full of wives and children, and he may not allow us to live with him. Even if we force our way in, we will inevitably be envied, despised, and insulted. If we live separately, we have no legal status at all. Rich men's feelings are probably fleeting. Once he falls in love with someone else, we can cry ourselves to death in front of him, but we will inevitably be abandoned. If we are still young at that time, we can go back to our old business and barely survive. But if we are old, then we are really helpless. If we marry a poor man, alas, supporting a man is such an awful term. Not only does it sound bad, but in reality, we are like fresh flowers that are trampled on for nothing, earning money to support him. Although he may offer some small courtesies like pouring water and wiping shoes, as for the future, a person who can't even support himself, how can we expect him to support his wife in the future? So we just live our lives day by day, without feeling anything. But when it's late at night and we are alone, thinking about our future, it's like ten thousand arrows piercing our heart, and we stare blankly at the sky until dawn.

Zhang Cuihong's Last Work  Yuan Hong

Classical beauty Zhang Cuihong, because her husband Xu Heng (not the goalkeeper sports star) did not want her delicate body working day and night in the photography studio, had long advised her to retire to her family. Miss Zhang accepted all of her [husband's] kind intentions. However, [China United Beauty]'s debut work, [Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai], is her lead role, and there is a reason for this.

[China United Beauty] was jointly established by film industry tycoons Yan Chuntang, Zhang Shankun, Wu Bangfan, Yu Ying, Li Dashen, Yan Youxiang, and others. The purpose is to seek thorough cooperation in the film industry. Therefore, directors and actors are hired from various companies. The heads believed that Zhang Cuihong was the most qualified for the female lead Zhu Yingtai, so they sincerely invited her with the collective face and sincerity. Although Zhang Cuihong had no intention of working on the screen, she had no choice but to reluctantly agree out of consideration for the kindness of so many people. So this play may be Zhang Cuihong's last work. Perhaps she will come out again in three to five years, but at least for those years, we will not see her new works.

Early Birth of a Precious Child is a film depicting the psychological states of various women regarding childbearing. The image above is a scene from the film.

Tales from the Pot Studio  Su Shaoqing

The Red-Haired Devil Liu Tang's Mistake Regarding the Eight-Inch Leg (Part 1)

The novel Water Margin is wonderful in its depiction of characters. The 108 people each have their own personality and tone. Dramas adopt stories from this book the most, and the 36 Heavenly Spirits are the most famous. Therefore, the names and nicknames of the 36 people are recorded in the collective novels, which is proof that they were real people. However, there are quite a few differences in nicknames and personal names. Now I will pick up a few people to elicit a smile.

In the play Sitting in the Tower to Kill Xi at the Wulong Temple, there is a scene of Liu Tang delivering a letter. Liu Tang's nickname is Red-Haired Devil, which can be found in Yihe's Anecdotes, as well as Water Margin. Liu Bao sings a line in the Wulong Temple drum song: [The Red-Haired Devil Little Liu Tang delivers the letter,] (According to the Water Margin story, a small word is added in the sentence, which is used for singing to make the sentence,) According to Zhou Mi of the Southern Song Dynasty's Sequel to Xin Zashi, there is a section that reprints Xi Ju and others' Eulogy to Song Jiang and the 36 People, the sixth person is Liu Tang with the Eight-Inch Leg, the eulogy says: [The general is short, the book calls him a marquis and king, you are not a man, your legs are eight inches long.] It means that Liu Tang's legs are short, only eight inches long, so he is called Eight-Inch Leg, not Red-Haired Devil. Mr. Xi had seen the images of Gao Ru, Li Chong, and 36 others, saying that Liu Tang's short legs must be correct. The six characters Eight-Inch Leg and Red-Haired Devil have the same sounds and rhymes. The character [hair] can also be read with the sound of [eight], and both are entering tone characters. [Devil] and [leg] can also have the same rising tone. It is a mistake in the spoken change of written words, and because he has not seen the portraits or Mr. Xi and Mr. Zhou's records.
