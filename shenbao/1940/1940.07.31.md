Editorial

### Prospects of the Anglo-German War

There is no hope of reconciliation between Britain and Germany, at least in the near future. As for the manner in which the war will begin, it is likely that Germany will launch a Hitler-style, storm-like "Blitzkrieg" to swiftly crush the resistance of the British Isles and conquer them, so that Hitler can complete his plan to control all of Europe before other international developments affect the course of the war.

Let us examine this issue from two perspectives: First, what is the possibility of implementing a so-called "Blitzkrieg" against Britain? Second, what does Germany hope to achieve in the next stage of the overall European war?

The so-called "Blitzkrieg," as defined by Hitler himself, consists of only two points: (1) To wage war at a moment's notice, catching the enemy off guard. To suddenly start operations like lightning when the enemy is most lax and inattentive. (2) To concentrate forces and strike the enemy's most fatal weakness first, and to repeatedly strike that weakness as heavily as possible. For example, in last year's Polish campaign, even at the very last moment before the war, the Polish authorities believed that Germany would never dare to provoke a large-scale European war. Therefore, assuming that Poland was determined to resist, they concluded that Hitler had absolutely no courage to attack Poland. As a result, they played diplomatic games as much as possible, using various methods to mock Germany, while on the other hand, they completely displayed a state of unserious laxity. Hitler targeted this phenomenon and launched an eleven-pronged general attack on Poland, reaping the first triumph of the "Blitzkrieg" tactic. Another example is the recent French campaign. Originally, France's most fatal weakness in this war was the absolute inferiority of its human resources. Hitler seized upon this weakness of France, concentrated his land and air forces, and surged forward rapidly, forcing France to make an immediate decision, exposing this inferiority of France immediately. As a result, the "Blitzkrieg" tactic achieved its hoped-for victory for the second time. As for the upcoming campaign against Britain, Britain will not be caught off guard as Poland was, but Britain is still at an absolute disadvantage in terms of the quantity, equipment, and training of its army. If Germany can force the British army to engage in immediate decisive battle, Germany may be able to win in the shortest period. However, between the European continent and the British Isles lies an ocean. In the process of Germany crossing the sea to attack, it must first encounter the British navy. A comparison of naval power reveals Germany's greatest weakness. If Hitler has no so-called secret weapon, then only air power can be the main force for attacking Britain. The relative strength of air power will likely determine the success or failure of this German "Blitzkrieg" against Britain. If Hitler does not have absolute confidence in the relative strength of air power, then the so-called "Blitzkrieg" against Britain may not appear immediately.

Furthermore, observing Hitler's current ambitions: Since March of last year, when Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, and at the beginning of September, when it fully launched its attack on Poland, his military power has expanded to parts of Northern Europe and the entire Western European continent this year. As a result, he currently has a heavy task of consolidation that must be completed. Before consolidation is complete, will he concentrate all his forces and venture again on the continent? This is a big question! The greatest purpose of foreign aggression is nothing more than to increase one's own strength. The first step to be imitated after conquering new territories is to digest and absorb the annexed countries as much as possible, so that one's own strength gradually expands, and then engage in new adventures. Whether Germany has already digested and absorbed the strength of all the annexed countries is something that anyone knows is not the case. Therefore, before it expands further outward, its greatest current task is definitely not to attack the British Isles!

We conclude the above analysis by saying that in the near future, apart from the air war between Britain and Germany, which may become increasingly tense, the so-called "Blitzkrieg" still needs to wait!

### Burma Road Blockade Firmly Opposed by the United States; Undersecretary Welles Reaffirms Position; General Opinion is that Britain and America Should Maintain Cooperation in the Far East

Washington

Acting Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the US government will continue to take a firm stand against the blockade of the Burma Road. Welles believed that a reporter's claim that he had previously announced that the US government was willing to discuss with the legitimate government of China the abolition of extraterritorial rights, would weaken the US's opposition to the blockade of the Burma Road. The reporter told Welles that his previous statement was widely misunderstood, as many believed it was a sign that the government was preparing to compromise. Welles said that he hoped to have the opportunity to explain any misunderstanding. He also reiterated the government's intention that the US is willing to reopen negotiations with the legitimate government of China on the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China at the appropriate time. When a reporter asked him if this was a sign that the US government was preparing to compromise on the Burma Road, Welles firmly said, "Absolutely not true." Welles also said that he had not received any reports regarding Japan's peace terms to China. (United Press dispatch, dated the 30th)

New York

Reuters has learned that the detailed circumstances of the Burma Road blockade are not yet fully known, but events prior to the blockade have gradually been revealed. It is now heard that there is no doubt that before the British agreed to block the road, they consulted with the United States and proposed a joint action by the British and American governments in the Far East. Both governments have been investing in the Far East to counter Japan's aggression and aid China, but this proposal was abruptly rejected. The British government, lacking American aid, then granted the Japanese request, undoubtedly due to its position of fighting for life and death in Europe. After the US rejected the proposal and the British granted the Japanese request, the US took actions that were at least aimed at indirectly opposing Japan, namely, classifying oil and scrap metal as goods requiring export licenses. Regardless of whether this move was intended to deal with Japan, Washington newspapers and observers all expected it to be tantamount to an embargo when implemented. Some observers are now wondering why the US only took action after Britain conceded. It is said that if the US had acted earlier, Britain's response to Japan might have been different. The situation beforehand was as follows: Britain notified the US of Japan's demands, stating that Britain did not want to comply with these demands, and its current position would not be subject to intimidation from any party, unless Japan declared war on Britain, in which case the US would intervene as a guarantee. Britain would take a firm stance in the Far East, but while Hull made statements about maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, the US government did not provide such guarantees. Japanese propagandists in the US are now attempting to portray this move by Britain as an attempt to counteract the impact of Welles' comments on consular jurisdiction in China, and claiming that Britain is seeking to remove General Chiang Kai-shek and preparing to negotiate the abolition of consular jurisdiction with the "puppet government." This morning, the "Washington Post" published an article by Kawakami, which expressed the same arguments. However, there is ample evidence here to prove that Britain's position is no different from the US position expressed by Welles this morning, namely, to engage in such negotiations with the legitimate government of China recognized by all. According to reliable sources in Washington, at a recent meeting of Japanese officials in Nanjing, it was revealed that the Japanese army had largely lost its ambition to force the Chinese government to collapse. The Japanese army is now considering abandoning the puppet government and allowing the Chongqing government to return to Nanjing, with General Chiang Kai-shek temporarily retiring. It is widely believed that this shift is a clear sign of the decline of Japanese power. (Reuters dispatch, dated the 29th)

### US President Requests Authorization to Call Up National Guard for Full Training to Cope with World Crisis

Washington

President Roosevelt yesterday again requested Congress to authorize the call-up of the National Guard, and stressed that Congress must grant the President this power. If this power is granted to the President, the President can make more than 250,000 National Guardsmen serve for a year of active duty. Well-informed sources believe that President Roosevelt's purpose is clearly: (1) To have the National Guard engage in combat training so that it can supplement the regular army in the event of war; (2) To enable the US to send a large part of the regular army to overseas areas to train the National Guard and engage in the defense of important areas such as the Far East.

### United States Accelerates Great Defense Program; Building Factories, Improving Army Equipment, Forming Air Raid Warning Teams Stationed in Various Locations

Washington

The US War Department announced last night that the value of the contracts signed by the Department has exceeded US$17 million. These contracts are part of the equipment and construction of the War Department's Great Defense Program. The largest contract is with the Diesel Engine Division of General Motors Corporation of Texas to build engines for medium tanks for the Army, worth US$3 million. Other contracts for building trucks, communication equipment, and other machinery have also been signed. According to well-informed sources, the US War Department will also allocate US$5.2 million from the US$220 million approved by Congress for the construction of necessary factories to build a factory for manufacturing searchlights and anti-aircraft gun reflectors, and has selected a location near Cincinnati for the factory. The first factory to be prepared by the Army is the smokeless powder factory, with a budget of US$30 million. The factory site is in Hamilton, Indiana, and will be built by DuPont Nemours Company. Another 106 factories of the same type are also planned to be built and are currently under consideration by the War Department. Yesterday, the Army also announced that it is preparing to establish four air raid warning teams. This design is the first step in consolidating the coastal defense plan. With the establishment of this organization, in the event of an air raid, a simple order can be issued to directly activate interceptors and anti-aircraft guns to counter the air raid. The first team will have 250 personnel and will be stationed in Mitchel Field, New York, Houston, Texas, and California. The War Department also plans to establish six such teams along the Atlantic coast, one team in the Gulf of Mexico, three teams in the Pacific, and teams will also be established in Alaska, Hawaii, Panama, and Puerto Rico in sequence.

### The Outcome of British Concessions to Japan: Anti-British Sentiment in Japan Intensifies; Using the Pretext of Suppressing Espionage, Many Foreigners are Arrested; This Japanese Move Clearly Carries Political Significance

Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, at today's cabinet meeting, Army Minister Tojo gave a detailed report on the death of Reuters correspondent in Tokyo, Cox, and on "the British espionage network in Japan." After the cabinet meeting, Tojo, Navy Minister Yoshida, and Foreign Minister Matsuoka exchanged views on various pending diplomatic issues. Subsequently, Matsuoka also met with Prime Minister Konoe to discuss the diplomatic actions to be taken regarding the "British espionage case." At the same time, there were reports of arrests of "foreign spies" in Kurume, Kyushu, and Keijo, Korea. According to Japanese sources, a spokesman for the Kurume military police stated that since the outbreak of the China Incident, they have been closely monitoring foreign espionage activities. As of July 27, several foreign spies have been arrested because their actions have become quite active since the international situation changed, and they can no longer be ignored. All those arrested are currently being interrogated in both Shimonoseki and Kurume. The report also stated that according to a telephone call from Keijo, Korea, the Korean Army and the prosecutor's office issued a joint statement at 3:00 PM today, stating that the Korean Army had arrested several foreign spies in a nationwide crackdown on foreign espionage and are currently interrogating them. (Reuters, 30th)

Tokyo: After Japanese newspapers reported the large-scale arrest of British nationals in Japan on charges of espionage, they today denounced Britain for engaging in large-scale espionage activities in Japan. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that Britain used its unprecedented propaganda and conspiracies in the last World War to make Germany surrender. Since the outbreak of this European war, Britain has exerted considerable effort in propaganda in Japan and has been carrying out activities to create a fifth column. Its objectives are threefold: (1) to create public opinion in Japan to induce Japan to join the European war on the British side; (2) to prevent Japan from providing military or material assistance to Germany and Italy; and (3) to obstruct the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. The "Asahi Shimbun" accused Britain of planting a systematic network of propaganda and conspiracy organs within Japan, stating that there are 200 banks and other commercial establishments within Japan with capital of 50,000 yuan or more that are affiliated with British financiers. There are 30 associations and clubs under British influence, and 200 churches presided over by British nationals. The "Hochi Shimbun" claimed that British religious groups and educational institutions in Japan are all performing the functions of a fifth column. (Reuters, 30th)

### Arrest of British Nationals: Britain Lodges a Protest with Japan; Ambassador Craigie Visited Matsuoka Yesterday, Stating that British Nationals in Japan Have No Political Activities

London: Reuters diplomatic correspondent has just obtained information from responsible sources here that British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka yesterday to lodge a protest regarding the arrest of British nationals in Japan. It is reported that the British Ambassador pointed out that the British side will take a serious view of this action, and it is possible that strict views may be taken elsewhere. It is unavoidable that this case will be seen as having political significance. At the same time, the British Ambassador clearly stated to Matsuoka that British nationals have never engaged in any political activities. The only accusation that can be made against them is that they have worked to improve British-Japanese relations. The British Ambassador further mentioned the fact that there is a powerful and efficient Nazi Party organization within Japan and that all its members are trained in propaganda and political activities. The "News Chronicle" has recently published a commentary on the arrest of British nationals in Japan. After the arrest of several British nationals yesterday, it was also reported that Reuters correspondent in Tokyo, Cox, committed suicide by jumping from the Tokyo military police headquarters. No one in Britain can believe that Cox was either pushed out of the window or was being "severely interrogated" to the point of unbearable suffering. The British government must insist on a full investigation and adequate compensation for this unexpected incident. The newspaper also stated that Britain should clearly tell Japan that if anti-British activities continue unabated, Britain's policy will be reviewed, and the Burma Road can be reopened at any time. (Reuters, 30th)

### British Cabinet Considers Response Measures

London: Due to the press's demand that the British government reopen the Burma Road and arrest Japanese nationals in London in retaliation for the Japanese authorities' arrest of British nationals, the British cabinet held a meeting today to consider Ambassador Craigie's report on the Japanese actions. According to reliable sources, the British cabinet is currently considering whether retaliatory action is beneficial and possible. It is also reported that the British House of Commons is expected to receive a government statement after the start of today's afternoon session. Therefore, this issue will inevitably be raised in the House of Commons. The cabinet has quickly discussed whether or not to take retaliatory action. Craigie's report arrived this morning, and it is believed that the British Ambassador will report in detail on the Japanese arrest of British nationals, the death of Reuters reporter Cox, and his protests to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka. (Associated Press, 30th)

### Cox's Tragic Death: Condolences from All Quarters

### Two More British Nationals Arrested

London: According to reports from Tokyo, two more British nationals have been arrested. Together with those arrested previously, the total has reached thirteen. One is Bliss in Kobe, and the other is Stoddart in Nagasaki (Associated Press, 30th)

### If One is Determined to Find Fault, One Can Always Find a Pretext

New York: Reuters General Manager Zhang Xuelou, currently in New York, told an Associated Press reporter that the American newspaper report that the late Cox was a special agent of the British government is purely fantasy. He never paid any attention to espionage news. Cox was always a purely news agency employee and never published news that the Japanese could oppose. Cox loved Japan very much and had no relationship with the British government. (Reuters, 30th)

London: Sir Lock, Chairman of the Federation of British Industries, commented to the press on the mass arrest of British nationals in Japan, saying, "As far as the Federation of British Industries is concerned, it is absurd to suspect that the representatives of this association are involved in espionage." Among the twelve British nationals arrested, James, the association's representative in Japan, is one of them. Lock said that he has not yet received official news of James's arrest. According to the Asiatic Petroleum Company here, they have not received news of the arrest of Mr. Whalen, the company's deputy manager. It is reported that Whalen is the eleventh British national arrested in Japan. (Associated Press, 30th)

### British House of Commons Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss Diplomatic Debate Methods

London: Prime Minister Churchill rose to speak after the House of Commons meeting, saying that a week ago the government believed that the House wished to hold a diplomatic debate and that it should be held in secret so that members of all parties could express their feelings towards foreign countries freely without any risk of increasing the number of countries with which Britain is now at war (great laughter). The Prime Minister said that whether the diplomatic debate should be held in secret or in public, he would let the House of Commons decide for itself. The House then immediately held a secret meeting to decide on this issue, and all observers left the meeting. (Reuters, 3rd)

London: Whether today's House of Commons debate on diplomacy should be public or secret will not be answered until the House convenes. The government will only make a decision after further consultations with members today. (Reuters, 30th)

### The Power of the British Navy Should Not Be Underestimated: Commentary from Pravda

London: The Soviet Pravda reported that the British navy has suffered very little loss, only about 3.5% of its total tonnage, which is insignificant. The successful retreat from Dunkirk shows that the British fleet is capable of rescuing a large army and demonstrates that an invasion of Britain will be very difficult. It is almost impossible to conquer British overseas territories. The power of the German fleet is, of course, far inferior to that of the British fleet. British maritime history has taught people the two most important points of the navy, which are organization and discipline. We intend to make every effort to achieve these two points and equip the Red Navy with the best organization, discipline, and the best possible technical structure. (Reuters, 30th)

### French Press Comments on the British-German War Situation

Vichy: "Le Temps" recently published an editorial commenting on the situation of the war between Britain and Germany, stating, "There are various signs that the long-rumored war against Britain is about to begin. German radio stations have issued messages saying that the offensive against Britain is only a matter of time. The German side believes that the war against Britain will be the final act of the current European war. Whether this view is correct remains to be proven by facts. However, at present, there is absolutely no possibility for Britain and Germany to reach a compromise, and no matter which party comes forward to mediate, it will definitely not succeed under the current circumstances. This is beyond doubt." (Havas, 30th)

### New Achievements of the Pan-American Conference: A Major Victory for American Policy; The Conference Will Open After the Security Treaty is Signed; A Seven-Nation Committee is Organized to Handle Foreign Territories

Havana: Today, the 21 American republics will formally sign the resolution of the "Monroe Doctrine" to completely isolate the Western Hemisphere from powerful forces and prevent their aggression. The representatives have unanimously passed various plans to enhance the permanent security and harmony of the New World. These plans include (1) a plan to prevent European territories in the Western Hemisphere from falling into the hands of other countries; (2) an economic agreement to make the Western Hemisphere self-sufficient; (3) a plan to prevent non-Americans, Communists, Nazis, and Fascists from operating in the Americas. In general, the results of the conference are considered a victory for the United States. The conference is scheduled to officially close at 6:30 PM tonight. Half an hour later, US Secretary of State Hull and other US representatives will leave here for Miami and then proceed to Washington. Last night, American representatives, in a tense closed-door plenary session, turned the history of the New World in a new direction. They unanimously approved the main plans. The greatest achievement of the conference was the realization of the American determination to prohibit European territories in the Western Hemisphere from being transferred into the hands of non-Americans, which was adopted by the representatives. In practical terms, this conference means that the American republics will henceforth cooperate with each other on American political issues in an unprecedented way. (Associated Press, 30th)

Havana: At yesterday's plenary session of the Pan-American Conference, the "Havana Agreement," which stipulates that when the integrity of American countries is threatened due to the transfer of colonies, they can act independently or collectively, was passed. The agreement stipulates that if urgent action is needed and cannot be delayed, the American republics can take the actions they deem appropriate, individually or collectively, to defend their territories or the entire continent. It is generally believed that this provision indicates that the Latin American countries agree to the United States undertaking the defense of the entire continent and limiting the scope of the war to Europe. The agreement also stipulates the establishment of a temporary committee composed of seven members, which will be responsible for administering the administrative affairs of the colonies when the colonies are threatened before the establishment of the Alliance of the Conference. After the establishment of the Alliance, this administrative power will be transferred to the Territorial Management Committee of the American countries, which will be organized by 21 countries. This temporary committee will be composed of representatives from Brazil and other seven countries. (Reuters, 30th)

Capital of Cuba: The Pan-American Conference here announced the organization of a temporary committee to take united action when there is a change in the ownership of foreign territories in the Western Hemisphere. This committee is composed of representatives from seven countries, including Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador, Panama, the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Paraguay, and will continue to serve until the convention of the permanent organization is approved by two-thirds of the American countries.

Havana

The Second Secret Plenary Session of the American Foreign Ministers unanimously approved the Pan-American Joint Custody System, so as to take care of the colonies of the defeated European countries in the Western Hemisphere under the principles of the Monroe Doctrine. The conference also passed the "Havana Act," so that the proposals passed by the conference can be implemented temporarily. At the same time, the conference also passed a principle stating that the proposals passed by the conference do not apply to territorial disputes between American and non-American countries. The conference also passed a proposal from the Argentine Committee. After a vote, it was decided that the next conference will be held in Rio de Janeiro. Argentina submitted a reservation, stating that "the Malvinas and other Australian Argentine" are not colonies of European countries, so the Havana Declaration does not apply to these lands. Observers believe that Argentina's reservation is quite important, because the reservation not only declares that the Falklands are Argentine territory, but also opens the door for its claims to the South Antarctic Islands. Argentina's reservation will be regarded by the world as Argentina's intention to covet the South Antarctic Islands. Argentina recently sent observers to the South Antarctic with American explorers.

### American Newspaper Advocates Building Military Bases in South America

Washington: "The Washington Post" wrote yesterday that the United States is very pleased that the representatives of the Pan-American Conference in Havana have reached an understanding on major issues. However, for military necessity, the United States should build bases in South America. Without a positive military commitment, any plan to defend the Western Hemisphere against possible invasion will be difficult to complete. Because the United States is the strongest of the 21 republics, the United States should bear the responsibility for defending most of the Western Hemisphere. This is known to everyone. If the United States cannot build naval and air bases in key locations in South America, it will ultimately be difficult for the United States to fulfill this responsibility. (Associated Press, 30th)

### Spain and Portugal Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty

Madrid: Official documents here stated that the Spanish Minister to Portugal and the Portuguese Foreign Minister signed a mutual assistance treaty in Lisbon today. When the independence or sovereignty of one of the contracting states is threatened, the other party will come forward to assist. This treaty will take effect immediately after signing. The conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the two countries has further promoted the relationship between the two countries. (Haitong, 30th)

### Turkish Press Discusses German-Turkish Relations

Istanbul: Yesterday, Turkish newspapers prominently published articles on the relationship between Germany and Turkey and the Balkans, stating that after the establishment of the German-Turkish commercial agreement, it is hoped that the relationship between the two countries can also be improved at the same time. The Tasviri Efkar newspaper stated that the signing of the German-Turkish commercial agreement is the best evidence that Germany wants to maintain a legitimate and permanent relationship with the Near East. (Haitong, 30th)

### Latvia Reforms Land Policy

Riga: The Latvian Cabinet passed a new law on land policy reform yesterday after a resolution by the National Assembly. The law stipulates the establishment of a national agricultural fund, composed of state-owned land, church land, and land owned by wealthy farmers with more than 30 acres of land. Farmers with more than 30 acres of land must transfer the excess land to the government, adding it to the land fund. Landowners can cultivate the excess land indefinitely, but may not charge fees. (Haitong, 30th)

Riga: The Latvian Cabinet issued an order yesterday to dismiss the Latvian Ministers to London and Washington, Mr. Salins and Dr. Pirmanis, respectively. The government will also prosecute them for violating service discipline. (Haitong, 30th)

### Soviet Troops Mass on Romanian Border

Bucharest: The Soviet side is currently maintaining a firm attitude and is engaged in the severe discipline and fairness required there in Bessarabia. Moscow demands that Romania must treat the returning Bessarabians well, otherwise the Soviet Union will retaliate with border plans. According to travelers from Bukovina, the Soviet Union has thickly concentrated mechanized units along the new border of the Prut River to back up its demands to Romania. It is said that the Soviet Union has massed a large number of troops on the Romanian border, and therefore questions have arisen from several quarters, namely: if Germany devotes all its efforts to Britain, will the Soviet Union take the opportunity to send troops across the Hungarian southern plain to South Slavs where the tide of Great Slavic nationalism is relatively high? Now Germany and the Soviet Union are staring at each other in Bulgaria. It is not certain that the Bulgarian rulers will bring back a proposal to solve the Dobruja problem after meeting Hitler in Salzburg, but they will only receive advice to directly solve this matter with Romania in the near future. If so, the government will not be surprised, but those who hope that this trip will achieve greater results cannot help but be disappointed. The Salzburg meeting seems to have had no immediate effect on the demand for border revisions, and the Romanian rulers seem to have accepted Hitler's instruction for Romania and Hungary to negotiate directly. Berlin correspondents claim that the interests of the Axis powers in Southeast Europe are still purely economic. For this reason, peace must be maintained. As for Outer Transylvania, there is no doubt that Germany wants to cede several border provinces to Hungary and allow 2.5 million residents to become autonomous under German "protection." According to the German-language Riga Daily, the Nazi attitude has not been deceived by those who suddenly became friendly with Germany. Germany is willing for countries to conduct direct bilateral negotiations to resolve disputes in Southeast Europe, but Outer Transylvania has a deep relationship with German culture. Hitler has not allowed Germans from minor races to immigrate to Outer Transylvania in his immigration plan, which is enough to show that he has prepared a plan to place them under his own protection. The development of the Salzburg talks seems to have eased Romania's concerns, as the demand for border revisions seems to have been temporarily shelved. It is generally believed that the current Romanian government seems to be staying in office, and only the three members of the Iron Guard cabinet who recently resigned will be replaced by new members. (Reuters, 30th)

### Slovak Cabinet Reshuffle

Capital of Slovakia: Slovak President Dr. Tiso appointed Prime Minister Duga to concurrently serve as Foreign Minister, and appointed Interior Minister Kuna to concurrently serve as Commander of the Hlinka Guard. Former Foreign Minister and Interior Minister Dukansky has resigned at his own request. (Haitong, 30th)

Berlin: German leader Hitler, upon the recommendation of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, appointed Foreign Ministry Envoy Klingel to be the new German Minister to Slovakia. The current Minister, Bernard, has been ordered to return to external service. According to records, Klingel is an old member of the National Socialist Party. During the First World War, he served as the captain of a torpedo boat. Afterwards, he served as the Prime Minister of Saxony Province and the Consul of San Francisco. (Haitong, 30th)

### Plans to Conduct Field Research on Chinese Customs and Manners

Tokyo: The "Asahi Shimbun" recently reported that the semi-official East Asia Problem Research Association plans to dispatch a research team to China to thoroughly understand the Chinese people, investigate customs and manners, and the current economic situation. The research will be led by the Vice President of the association, Okura. "Chinese people have always regarded traditional customs as sacred and inviolable. If they are not taken into consideration, any plans established for them will fail. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly understand them." The results of the team's research are expected to be published by the end of March 1942, at which time it will not be difficult to become "a good foundation for building a new Asia." (Havas, 29th)

### 空 Battle of Dover: German Planes Shot Down - Twenty Planes Lost. English Bombers Raid Seventeen Locations in Europe Overnight. English Armed Fishing Boat Sunk by Mine.

London - The Air Ministry announced that on Sunday night, English bombers raided military targets in northern and western Germany, the German-Dutch-Belgian borders, and northern France. The bombed targets included seventeen locations with oil depots, docks, cargo, and airfields. Three English planes are missing. Coastal Command English planes attacked the Cherbourg oil tanks in French territory, causing multiple fires. The English planes have returned safely. Furthermore, one English bomber attacked the Ruwardon airfield in Dutch territory, damaging several enemy planes on the ground. When the bomber was returning, it was intercepted by four enemy fighters. After a brief air battle, one enemy plane was shot down and the bomber returned safely. (30th Reuters)

London - The Air Ministry announced that yesterday afternoon, English fighters shot down an enemy bomber each over the English Channel coast and the Thames estuary. It has now been confirmed that in the Battle of Dover yesterday morning, in addition to the enemy bombers shot down by English fighters, two more were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The total number of enemy planes shot down yesterday reached twenty. (30th Reuters)

London - The Admiralty announced tonight that the English armed fishing boat "Stoneden" has sunk after hitting an enemy mine in a certain sea area. The families of the ship's officers and crew have been notified separately. (29th Havas)

London - According to news received here yesterday afternoon, as a result of the fierce air battle over England yesterday, as many as twenty-seven German planes were shot down. According to those who witnessed the air battle over the southeastern coast on that day, there were about one hundred and sixty-seven German planes fighting with English planes. The sound of gunfire and bombing was deafening and frightening. The German planes fell like leaves, piece by piece. The Air Ministry described the air battle on the southeastern coast, stating that there were thirty Heinkel planes, eighty-seven Stuka dive bombers, and fifty Messerschmitt escort fighters, which attacked the harbor from the sky. English Spitfires and Hurricanes then took off to meet the enemy. Within minutes, the sky was densely packed with planes. The pilots of the English fighters engaged closely with the German pilots, making it impossible for the German planes to drop bombs. This air raid on the southeastern coast was the first large-scale attack on England's land. In addition to the fifteen planes officially announced to have been shot down by English planes, eyewitnesses also said that English anti-aircraft guns shot down four German planes. According to observers, when the English fighters were engaging the German planes above the anti-aircraft guns, they waited outside the range of the anti-aircraft guns. When the German planes could not withstand the anti-aircraft fire and increased their speed to retreat to their defensive positions, the English fighters flew to intercept them. This German air raid was an attempt to bomb both naval targets simultaneously. According to one eyewitness, the German planes dropped bombs like hail, except that they were not transparent but black. Most of the bombs dropped were incendiary bombs. The attackers were discovered at sunrise from the sea's eastern horizon. However, before they flew close to their targets, English anti-aircraft fire was already spraying flashing bullets at these dive bombers. The German planes dived like bees and locusts, and regardless of the danger, charged directly at the anti-aircraft fire. The Stuka dive bombers charged over the area they wanted to bomb and dropped their bombs. According to eyewitnesses, each plane seemed to drop one large bomb and four small bombs. After this batch of planes arrived, the second batch of planes arrived. The English fighters and anti-aircraft guns' defensive work became more intense. The terrifying bombs caused the buildings in the entire area to collapse, shattered the windows of houses miles away, and caused the seawater to spray upwards due to the violent shock, forming white waves. The ships in the sea were also shaken by the waves. Because the anti-aircraft fire was very dense, the last batch of bombers stopped diving and flew out of the range of the anti-aircraft fire. The English fighters rushed to pursue the German planes and fought with them to the English Channel. Only the sound of machine guns was heard over the coast, merging into one. Yesterday, according to the English official announcement, since June 18, the total number of German planes shot down over and near England has reached three hundred and eighteen. (30th Reuters)

### German War Report

Berlin - This afternoon, the German war report stated that German dive bombers attacked Dover Harbour, and four ships with a total tonnage of 32,000 tons were severely damaged. When the German planes bombed, several English planes responded. As a result of the fierce battle, fifteen English planes were shot down, and three German planes were lost. In addition, German planes engaged in aerial reconnaissance sank one 10,000-ton British cruiser and one 1,000-ton merchant ship. Another merchant ship was damaged. Last night, English planes attacked western and northern Germany. The targets hit were not military objectives. In the town of Dusseldorf, five houses were hit and caught fire. Fortunately, the air defense rescue team arrived quickly and extinguished the fire. Near Wolfenbüttel, four houses were hit, and two of them suffered the most damage. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)

### Explosion at Gibraltar Arsenal; Libyan Governor Inspects Border Defenses

Madrid - A loud explosion occurred in Gibraltar yesterday morning. The doors and windows of houses near the border were shaken. Spanish observers learned that the fire brigade had issued an alarm and a large number of ambulances rushed to the scene. English sources stated that a gasoline depot had exploded, but reliable sources claimed that the loud noise was an explosion at an arsenal, which killed four English soldiers and injured many more. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)

Milan - "Sera" reported yesterday that the Italian army recently bombed Gibraltar and destroyed part of the fortress. A bomb hit an anti-aircraft gun team, killing the team leader and four soldiers on the spot, and destroying three large armory buildings. The report continued that after the bombing, the remaining civilians in Gibraltar fled one after another, and only military personnel remained in Gibraltar. The British authorities are now very concerned about the battleships "Hood" and "Resolution" docked in the harbor. Although the situation in the harbor is extremely dangerous, the ships were injured in the battle of Balearic and cannot sail, so they have to remain in the harbor. The report continued that Italian planes bombed Aden and sank a merchant ship. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)

### Romania Prepares to Return Lost Territories to Hungary and Bulgaria; Establishes Liaison with Axis Powers; Bulgarian Prime Minister Returns Home

Bucharest - United Press learned from official sources here last night that Romania is willing to prepare to cede part of its territory to Hungary and Bulgaria in accordance with the agreement reached in Salzburg last week with Führer Hitler. Official sources stated that Romania has expressed its willingness to make concessions, believing that transferring this land is the most effective way to prevent communism from spreading to the Balkans and to ensure peace in southeastern Europe. It is rumored that Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini do not oppose the Soviet Union's occupation of Bessarabia Province, northern Bukovina Province, and the Baltic States, but have now launched efforts to curb the Soviet Union's westward advance and requested all Danube countries to cooperate in building an impregnable barrier.

Sofia - Bulgarian Prime Minister Professor Filov and Foreign Minister Popov returned here by German special plane at 6 pm last night. They told reporters that the results of the German-Bulgarian negotiations cannot be announced at present, but the trip to Germany was very satisfactory. After getting off the plane, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were received by King Boris and immediately held a special cabinet meeting. Bulgarian newspapers paid close attention to the peaceful tone of the Romanian press and were satisfied with the statement in the Romanian semi-official newspaper "Romania" that the territorial demands in southeastern Europe would be resolved peacefully for the sake of the future interests and friendly relations of all countries. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)

Sofia - After meeting with the King, the Bulgarian Foreign Minister announced to the press about the negotiations with Germany, stating that they were very satisfied with the discussions with the German Führer and Foreign Minister. The German press has stated that the negotiations were conducted in a spirit of friendship, frankness, and mutual understanding. The German Führer and other leaders expressed deep sympathy for Bulgaria's demands. They were deeply grateful for Hitler's realistic and just claims. The Foreign Minister concluded by saying that the Bulgarian people should be assured and look forward to future developments. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)

Bucharest - This morning, local newspapers published semi-official comments on the Salzburg talks, solemnly pointing out the Romanian government's determination to establish a liaison with the policies of the Axis powers. The article stated that the visit of Romanian politicians to Germany and Italy was the first direct contact with the German Führer, the Italian Prime Minister, and the foreign ministers of the two countries after Romania firmly expressed its willingness to establish a liaison with the Axis powers. The harmonious and friendly spirit during the talks clearly indicated Germany and Italy's understanding of our country and peace in southeastern Europe. Romania's future task is to abide by the points agreed upon in the Salzburg and Rome talks. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)

Germany Needs Peace in the Balkans

Bucharest - Highly experienced political observers in Southeastern Europe believe that any prediction of the direction of the so-called Balkan development before the next Soviet action is purely speculation. It is generally believed that the policy of mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and Germany has come to an end with the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia. From now on, Soviet policy will mainly be opportunistic, and its scope will largely depend on the extent of the German offensive against England. If the Soviet Union has controlled Bulgaria's freedom and does not take the opportunity to cede Dobruja and mediate with Romania to win Bulgaria's gratitude, it would seem strange. Germany is reportedly greatly angered by Britain's recent expression of sympathy for Bulgaria's demand for Southern Dobruja. Therefore, German propaganda agencies in Southeastern Europe are claiming that Britain has begun to incite border revisions in the Balkans to stir up unrest, while Germany needs peace in the Balkans. (30th Reuters)

Hitler's Main Objective Is Pacification

London - The Times commented today on the Balkan talks held at Berchtesgaden, stating that the initial feeling was that Hitler's main objective was pacification, using the entire group of countries between Germany's eastern border and the Aegean and Black Seas. Nothing has been discovered in these talks, as far as is known, that would dispel this impression. Hitler not only wants to avoid war, but even does not want conflicts to occur on both fronts simultaneously, which is his principle. Hitler still seems to want to focus all his efforts on conquering the British Empire. Will Hitler first deal with the enemy countries in Western Europe and then take the time to extend his hegemony to Eastern Europe? Or will he first control the resources of Eastern and Southeastern Europe and then, when his power is consolidated, fight the British Empire to the death? He will choose one. Judging from the current signs, he seems to be taking the first path. No matter what his final decision is, Britain is now waiting quietly, and believes that Hitler's reckless conquest plan will ultimately fail. (30th Reuters)

### Romanian Government Decides to Detain English Tugs

Sète - The Romanian government has decided to detain eighteen English-leased tugs at the mouth of the Danube. German propaganda suggests that the countries of Southeastern Europe will soon have to reject British newspaper reporters and stop receiving news from non-Axis countries. Several new reporters arriving in Europe are being actively supplied with news by the Germans. (30th Reuters)

London - Officials have announced that the British government has lodged a protest with the Romanian government, stating that the Romanian authorities' detention of British ships sailing on the Danube and interference in the affairs of the English Commercial Oil Company, and the expulsion of English technicians, are all arbitrary actions. Normal relations between the two countries will only be restored after Romania satisfies Britain. (30th Havas)

### Soviet Union Sends Note to Romania, Demanding the Return of Trains

(30th United Press)

### Suez Canal Traffic Increases Significantly; Improved Position of English Troops

London - A Reuters correspondent in Suez reports that Suez Canal traffic, which had once stopped after Italy entered the war, is now gradually increasing. Suez is now the main port of Egypt and is extremely active. Although facilities have increased, many ships are still forced to sail to Port Said or Alexandria to unload goods. Anglo-French relations are still satisfactory in terms of this canal. French officials are now working closely with the English Navy and Egyptian authorities. The majority of the Canal Authority's directors are French, but under the guidance of the French chairman, Benois, the work of the Bureau continues as usual, and the tolls collected are now stored in Cairo. According to English naval circles stationed along the river, Egypt is no longer at risk of supply cuts, as the Navy has repelled enemy ships advancing towards Massawa and Asab. Due to the constant surveillance and superiority of the English Navy in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, the enemy does not dare to disturb the English convoys. The ability and resources of the British Empire to respond are clearly visible from this point. Although British navigation in the Mediterranean has decreased, there is no panic here, and no rationing system has been implemented, because Britain has been supplying Egypt with goods from the Eastern Hemisphere. It is expected that the aircraft and other war equipment needed by the Middle East will soon be transported from the Americas to Egypt via this eastern route. The position of the English troops in the Middle East is very different from the pessimistic situation of the Italian troops in Abyssinia. Now that the supply to Abyssinia has been cut off, the Italian troops have turned from offense to defense. Although English merchant ships pass through the narrow Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which is easily within the range of Italian coastal batteries, the Italian navy and coastal batteries have so far not attempted to disturb navigation. At the beginning of the war, Italy had several submarines in the Red Sea, at least one of which was sunk by the English Navy. The only way for Italy to attack British shipping is through mines. Italy is extremely anxious about securing raw materials due to the activity of the English Air Force, and a large number of mechanical supplies will soon be needed to deal with the rebellions of various tribes in Abyssinia.

### Rumor: Germany Considers Ceding Poland to the Soviet Union; Intends to Extend Influence in the Balkans

London - According to information received here yesterday from Polish sources, Germany is currently considering ceding Poland to the Soviet Union. This plan is currently being discussed in Berlin and Moscow. According to Polish sources, the German authorities want to gain dominance in the Balkans, and in return have proposed merging the provinces of Warsaw, Lublin, and Lodz into a Polish Soviet Republic, subordinate to the Soviet Union. However, Germany still wants to retain Southern Galicia to avoid the Soviet Union gaining a common border with Slovakia and to serve as a German corridor to Romania. According to observers here, the development of this situation will create another difficulty for Britain, which has formally sought to restore Poland's independence, but has not yet proposed the return to Poland of the Polish territories occupied by the Soviet Union last September.

### Estonian Border Closure

The Finnish government has also agreed to hand over to the Soviet Union the factory equipment evacuated before the Soviet-Finnish peace. The Soviet government will provide appropriate compensation. In addition, issues related to the Soviet Union and Finland are still under discussion. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)

### 40th Anniversary of the Italian King's Accession

Rome - The 40th anniversary of the accession of Italian King Victor Emmanuel is being celebrated by newspapers across the country, with articles praising him. It is said that during the parliamentary system, the Italian King also promoted policies that reflected the wishes of the people, and devoted all his efforts to improving social laws and protecting the working class. When the Blackshirts of Italian Prime Minister marched into Rome, the Italian King rejected the advice of his cabinet members, refused to oppose fascism, and called it a patriotic youth movement. Since the Italian King's accession, the Italian army has won victories in previous battles, so it is believed that the current war will also be blessed by the Italian King and win victory.

### China, England and America should maintain close cooperation in the Far East, England can cancel Myanmar Road agreement at any time, Peace issue must first get Chinese permission

Since the British government allowed Japan's request to blockade the Burma Road, the Chinese side believes that the British diplomatic policy is weak and appeasing, only encouraging Japan's insatiable desire, and at the same time, it cannot reduce the threat to Britain in the Far East. The American government and the public also feel disappointed about this matter, and criticisms are constantly published in newspapers. The world is paying attention to this. Here, an English observer in this city recently issued a statement on the British recent approval of Japan's request to blockade the Burma Road. The main points are as follows:

Myanmar Road can be opened at any time

(1) The blockade of the Burma Road for three months is purely a temporary agreement. The British side reserves the right to cancel this agreement at any time. The most important condition agreed upon by the British and Japanese sides is that within these three months, efforts will be made to achieve peace between China and Japan, that is, both parties will freely negotiate a fair and equal solution. There is no question of Britain urging China to accept any conditions that it feels are harmful. A "fair and equal solution" clearly implies that Chinese permission must be obtained.

Maintain British and American cooperation in the Far East

(2) The Chinese people should have the impression that maintaining cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East is most beneficial to China. It is not in China's interest to try to create discord between Britain and the United States. Therefore, understanding between Britain and the United States should be cultivated. If the American government, for very good reasons in the current situation, feels it is not appropriate to guarantee what kind of action it will take in any specified situation, and if Britain feels that it is prudent to compromise with Japan because it has not received an American guarantee, then Sino-British, Anglo-American, or Sino-American relations should not be alienated as a result. Any attempt to stir up ill will among China, Britain, and the United States is not helpful, and only makes the positions of the three parties less favorable.

Britain and the United States need close understanding

(3) Englishmen should especially avoid criticizing the United States for not providing Britain with support. Both the British and American governments retain the freedom to act on their own. If the actions of both parties have not been parallel so far, it is because their respective situations have stronger reasons. Close understanding is needed between Britain and the United States, and this should not be harmed by the decision of the Burma Road.

Criticizing England is of no help

(4) On the other hand, Americans are also asked not to criticize the approach taken by the English side. It is ineffective to criticize British policy immediately without emphasizing the main points. The so-called main point is that England must now do everything possible to avoid making its position in the Far East more complicated, because England is now fighting for survival in Europe and cannot expect to defend rights around the world with one hand.

Gold Hall advises China and England to form an alliance

According to news from foreign sources, Gold Hall, who once served as the British naval attaché in China, recently sent a circular to various sectors, reporting on the world situation. One section mentioned the Far East, saying, "We have received news that the Japanese are not indifferent bystanders to the great gamble that Hitler and Mussolini are taking against England. We attach more importance to the Chinese people's resistance to Japanese aggression. If the Japanese intend to seize Hong Kong, then we hope that China and the British Commonwealth will form an alliance. The Chinese people have always kept their promises, and there is no doubt that they will become a major power in the world in this century. There are many points in common between the philosophy of Confucius and the principles of democratic life. If China and England form an alliance, we can supply the Chinese government's army with military supplies, and recognize that aggression is aggression, whether it occurs in Europe or the Far East. These ideas should be welcomed by the Chinese people, who believe that China is not without the possibility of participating in this great war of ideas abroad with its manpower. "

### Masnan Road Post Office: Japanese Side Did Not Inspect Mail Yesterday; Implementation Unlikely Before Za Peilin Returns to Shanghai, But Five Japanese Visited Again Yesterday for Observation

The Japanese side's attempt to inspect mail in the French Concession is increasingly evident. Yesterday, Japanese inspectors made arrangements and took some proactive actions at the Masnan Road post office, leading to rumors of an official inspection starting yesterday. However, the exact date of the official commencement of inspections remains unconfirmed. The events of yesterday are recorded as follows:

No Inspection

According to a statement released by the Postal Administration at 4:20 PM yesterday, the rumor that Japanese inspectors had already begun officially inspecting mail at the Masnan Road post office today (i.e., yesterday) is completely untrue. The Administration has also not received any verbal or written reports from the Masnan Road branch regarding the commencement of mail inspections. As for the suggestion to change the Masnan Road branch into a "non-delivery branch," the head office has not considered this.

Origin of Rumors

After Japanese personnel visited the Masnan Road post office to inspect various aspects of postal administration, preparations for mail inspection have indeed become more concrete. At 8:00 AM yesterday, five Japanese individuals went to the branch again. Besides inspecting the procedures from receiving to delivering mail, they also entered the mail room and briefly flipped through the mail awaiting delivery, which sparked the rumor that mail inspection had started yesterday morning. Reporters visited the branch authorities yesterday and were told that if the Japanese were to start inspecting mail, instructions would certainly arrive from the head office. As the person in charge was unaware of such an event, its authenticity should be evident. In short, it is unlikely that implementation will begin before Director Za Peilin arrives in Shanghai.

Building an Office

After discussions between the two sides, the future office for the Japanese inspectors has begun construction. The location is in the rear section of the existing office of the branch. Because the area is open, four walls must be added to create a separate room. Therefore, the postal staff who originally worked there have been relocated. Although the number of Japanese inspectors has not yet been determined, it is expected to be between five and seven. Most of them are graduates of the Dobun Shoin college and have a considerable foundation in Chinese, but are not familiar with English or French. This shows that the Japanese side's action is purely targeted at Chinese people and Chinese language letters.

### Although Zhejiang and Fujian are Under Navigation Ban, Inland Transportation is Flourishing; Smaller Vessels are Rerouting to Remote Areas; Although the Scope is Narrow, Traffic Continues

The *North-China Daily News* reports that the Japanese naval authorities are making every effort to strictly enforce the ban on coastal shipping that has been in effect since July 16. Consequently, certain types of Shanghai native products have become scarce due to the disruption of coastal shipping. Any ships of any nationality that continue to operate after the Japanese ban are

Immediately Detained

It is reported that the Portuguese-flagged ship *Sinta*, which was recently detained with its crew off Wenzhou, has now been released, carrying cargo and returning to Shanghai without loss. The ban imposed by the Japanese Navy has at least temporarily stifled the coastal shipping industry, but has not completely stopped operations. It is definitely known that several smaller flat-bottomed boats have been rerouted to

The Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River

to transport goods such as cotton from inland villages, opening up new routes. The freight cost for transporting each bale of cotton to Shanghai is as high as thirty-five yuan. Therefore, several smaller shipping companies are engaged in this business, which, although small in scale, is quite prosperous. It is reported that bristles are also being transported. According to people in the shipping industry, China's vast territory cannot completely halt inland navigation. Ports such as Ningbo and Wenzhou, which only allow access from one direction, can certainly be strictly banned, but in areas that have not been occupied, there are countless villages, which were not very important before, that can be used as small ports for the exchange of goods.

### Statistics on the Number of Refugees

According to a report from the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 25th of this month, there are currently thirteen inspected shelters, housing a total of 7,446 refugees.

### British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Leaves Shanghai for Summer Retreat; Took a Steamer North to Beidaihe the Previous Evening; Expected to Return to Shanghai in the Shortest Possible Time

British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, after returning to Shanghai on the 15th of last month, originally planned to go to Beidaihe for a summer retreat as usual. However, at that time, the situation in the Far East was tense, and the work of the British Ambassador also suddenly became busy, so the Ambassador's plan to go north for a summer retreat was invisibly canceled. However, one noon yesterday, the British Ambassador suddenly left Shanghai for elsewhere. Few people at the Embassy knew at the time. Even well-informed sources only knew that the Ambassador had left Shanghai, but were not very clear about exactly where the Ambassador was going. According to inquiries made by reporters from various relevant parties, the British Ambassador did indeed leave Shanghai, and boarded a steamer at 8:00 PM the previous night (the 29th) to Weihaiwei, then to Beidaihe. However, the Ambassador's trip north this time will not last many days, and he will shorten the summer retreat period as much as possible, and will return to Shanghai soon. Four Western detectives dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Police of the Public Concession to protect the Ambassador's safety were also temporarily withdrawn yesterday.

### Strike at the Shanghai Power Company: Management Proposes Counter-Conditions; Mr. Yu Qiaqing Met with Mr. Garrod Yesterday; Mr. Garrod Has Rejected the Workers' Demands

Regarding the strike at the British-owned Shanghai Power Company, the company's chairman, Mr. Garrod, confirmed that Mr. Yu Qiaqing visited him yesterday afternoon in the capacity of a mediator. However, he said that the details of the content of the talks could not be made public at this time. According to well-informed sources, including within the company, the rumor that the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council would act as a mediator has been denied. Mr. Yu met with workers' representatives last night and may meet with Mr. Garrod again this morning. However, judging from yesterday's meeting, in addition to firmly rejecting the five demands made by the labor side, the management side has instead proposed five conditions to the labor side. Therefore, the future of the strike is still difficult to be optimistic about.

Company Conditions

Mr. Yu Qiaqing conveyed the five preconditions proposed by the workers (already seen in yesterday's newspaper) to Mr. Garrod. Mr. Garrod expressed that it was difficult to accept them, and instead proposed five conditions to Mr. Yu, asking him to convey them to the labor side. The gist of the conditions is as follows: (1) The board of directors is not prepared to accept the strike demands, but they may return to work on the existing basis if they are willing, in accordance with the following conditions. (2) The company is not prepared to re-employ workers who are considered unstable. If a worker's position has already been filled by someone else, the original worker will no longer be employed. (3) Striking workers must agree not to strike again in the future. Reasonable requests must first be presented to the board of directors for consideration. (4) Employees must be prepared to accept any work assigned by the company. (5) Striking workers must sacrifice all wages for the period of their strike. The above conditions were conveyed to the labor side by Mr. Yu at 3:30 PM yesterday.

Employee Meetings After receiving these conditions, the company's employees and workers will separately inform all employees and workers. Both the employees and workers will each convene meetings to carefully discuss response measures. The results of the separate discussions will be jointly discussed again last night to determine consistent steps. The discussion lasted until late at night. According to disclosed information, it is likely that the labor side will once again ask Mr. Yu Qiaqing to do his best to mediate. Around this morning, the labor side will send representatives to meet with Mr. Yu to express specific opinions.

Council Efforts

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reports that there is a possibility of an early resolution to the strike at the British-owned Shanghai Power Company. A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council announced this morning (the 30th) that the Council's Industrial Section is making efforts to mediate this dispute, hoping to bring about a satisfactory end to the strike. It is believed that the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council is mediating, so both sides will hold talks in the next few days. At present, the Shanghai Power Company employs about one hundred temporary workers, mostly White Russian and German Jewish refugees. Although they are working hard, the supply of electricity has been greatly reduced compared to normal times. It is said that the supply of electricity to the French Concession has been reduced to less than one-third.

### Zhenhai Port is Peaceful

The Ningbo organizations in Shanghai have received a follow-up telegram after the recovery of Zhenhai as follows: (1) Zhu Kongyang and other comfort officers from Zhejiang Province arrived in Ningbo the day before yesterday, and went to a certain place yesterday to comfort. Today, they still need to hire civilian ships to go to Zhenhai to comfort the troops. (2) The day before yesterday, Zhenhai Port was peaceful all day. The movements of Japanese warships in the waters of Zhejiang are as follows: Two Japanese warships are currently anchored outside Zhenhai Port, four Japanese warships are anchored in the Longshan waters, and one Japanese warship is also anchored in the Wushishan waters, a total of seven ships. Also, at 7:30 AM the day before yesterday, one Japanese warship sailed from the Hengshan waters and anchored in the Huhutou waters of Fenghua without moving. (3) At 4:16 PM the day before yesterday, a Japanese aircraft was spotted in the airspace above Haimen. The Ningbo air defense watchtower issued an air raid warning. An emergency warning was issued at 4:20 PM. It flew over Ningbo, and then the whereabouts of the Japanese aircraft were unknown. The warning was lifted at 5:12 PM.

### Doctors Are Not Obstructed During Curfew; Emergency Consultations Can Be Requested by Telephone

According to news from the Shanghai Municipal Council, as summer is approaching, diseases are rampant. If doctors are called to visit patients during curfew hours, they only need to show their own business card to the police officers along the way to pass without obstruction. No additional passes are required. It is also convenient for citizens with emergency illnesses to call for medical attention late at night by telephone. Hopefully, all sectors will pay attention to this.

### Assault Case Between US Soldiers and Japanese Residents Concludes; US Consul, Etc. Visit Miura to Apologize

The English-language *North-China Daily News* reports that Japanese embassy spokesman Tsurumi Ken said that the assault case between US soldiers and Japanese residents at the Taiping Cafe on the night of July 15 was satisfactorily concluded yesterday (the 29th) afternoon. US Acting Consul General Porter and US 4th Marine Regiment Commander Colonel Baker visited Japanese Consul General Miura at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon to express their apologies for this unfortunate incident. It is reported that Colonel Baker also assured Miura that steps had been taken to prevent further accidents. Porter handed a letter of the same nature to the Japanese Consul General. Miura expressed complete satisfaction with the resolution of the case and said that he would abandon the intention to seek compensation for Japanese injuries. Regarding the arrest of a British resident in Japan at the end of the week, the spokesperson said that he had no comment to make.

### Chinese Going to Vietnam Must Have Passports; Due to Tense Situation, Guarantee Method is Cancelled

The Visa Section of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently received an official letter from the Consulate General in Hanoi, reporting changes to the handling of Chinese entering the country. The original text is recorded as follows: "We have received a letter from the Supreme Administrative Office in Tokyo (Vietnam) stating that due to the tense situation, the exceptional method of allowing Chinese citizens to enter the country without a passport, guaranteed by this Consul General or Luo Weiqi, representative of the overseas Chinese in Haiphong, should be cancelled. In the future, Chinese citizens coming to Vietnam must obtain a passport and a visa from the French consulate in China before they can enter the country, etc. In addition to forwarding it separately, we are attaching the original letter for your reference."

### US Warships Enter Port

After the US Navy transport ships *Black Hawk* and *Chaumont* left Shanghai one after another, it was reported yesterday that they had safely arrived in Qinhuangdao and Qingdao, and planned to stay for a short time. The *Chaumont* will return to Shanghai again at the beginning of next week to carry US Marines back to the United States. The *Gold Star* entered the Wusongkou at 6:00 PM (Customs clock) yesterday and arrived at the Yangjingbang Bund around 8:00 PM, moored at the British Navy pontoon, staying in Shanghai for a short time.

### During the Shutdown of the British American Tobacco Factory, Another Disturbance Arises; The Factory Again Dismisses Nine Representatives; It is Determined to Resume Work on August 2nd

The British American Tobacco factory at the intersection of Huade Road and Taopeng Road in Hongkou announced a three-week shutdown on the 10th of this month, abolishing all original rice subsidies and allowances for workers. In addition to paying wages during the shutdown period, workers were given a subsidy of one yuan per day, except for Sundays. Workers' original five dou of rice subsidy and 30% temporary allowance were cancelled. After calculation, their income suddenly decreased by as much as twenty yuan, which made it difficult to maintain their lives in this era of high rice prices. Therefore, at 8:00 AM on the 10th, more than 30 male and female representatives from various departments were selected to request factory manager Mr. Weisbrock to maintain the original treatment, but were unsuccessful. After finishing work on that day, all the workers stayed in the factory and refused to leave. The management side then telegraphed the police station to send police officers to the scene to suppress and disperse them. It is now known that the British American Tobacco factory has dismissed nine worker representatives. As for the workers' demands, they are still delayed and unresolved. The factory has also set the resumption of work on August 2nd. However, workers were surprised after the factory announced the dismissal of the nine representatives on the 19th. Because during the labor unrest in the factory on January 25th of this year due to workers requesting increased wages, the management's attitude was quite amiable, allowing representatives of various workers to discuss directly, and guaranteeing that workers would not be dismissed without cause, which ultimately led to a resolution. This time, the workers' motive for requesting that allowances be paid in accordance with the original subsidies during the shutdown period was legitimate. Unexpectedly, the management dismissed nine representatives. All the workers of the factory expressed their dissatisfaction and looked forward to the sympathy and assistance of people from all walks of life to eliminate this dispute.

### Hurricane Reaches Ryukyu

The newly formed hurricane in the Pacific Ocean continues to advance rapidly after changing direction. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, the hurricane has now reached 24 degrees north latitude and 129 degrees east longitude. According to the reported coordinates, it is near the Ryukyu Islands. The local climate has been affected within 60 nautical miles of the current center of the hurricane. At present, the hurricane is still moving in a northwesterly direction, so its development path deserves attention.

### After the Death of Qian Hongye, the Legal Community Unanimously Expresses Grief; Qian's Remains Will Be Placed in a Coffin Tomorrow

Qian Hongye, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, has served in the legal profession for more than 20 years. He was deeply knowledgeable in law, handled cases with the utmost impartiality, did not show favoritism or fear the powerful, but always showed leniency outside the law and gave the benefit of the doubt when the circumstances of the defendant were pitiful. After the illness of President Guo Yunquan, Qian acted as President. After the outbreak of the war, Qian and the court, despite repeated threats and intimidation, the police authorities ordered detectives to

Protect Them

However, Qian did not care at all, politely declining the protection from the police, and telling his colleagues that he would be loyal to his duty as long as he was in office, and he would not fear any threats. Moreover, his parents had both passed away, and his children were self-reliant, so he had no worries. Even if he lost his life in the line of duty, as long as he was not ashamed of the country and society, he would die with honor. After the assassination of Yu Hua, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the Gaochang Branch Court, some people advised him to accept police protection, but he still laughed it off. His

Firm and Decisive

spirit was praised by everyone. Now, it is unfortunate that he has been victimized, and people from all walks of life lament. The loss of such a fair, honest, and wise judge is a major loss to the judiciary. When Qian was dying, he told his family that he was not in pain and that he would die with integrity. The colleagues of the First Special Court said that although Qian had been victimized, they would continue Qian's

Indomitable

spirit, work hard in their positions, and never be discouraged by this. Qian's body has now been transported to the Central Funeral Home on Route Ma Bai. It is scheduled to be placed in a coffin tomorrow. At that time, colleagues from the First Special Court and the High Branch Court, as well as people from all walks of life, will go to express their condolences and plan to organize a memorial service to comfort the loyal soul.

### Adjusting the Public Rice Shops

### Impersonating to Collect Fake National Goods Certificates; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Sued; Official Certificates Must Be Collected Through the Association; Hope to Report Those Who Deceive

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an announcement regarding national goods certificates: "This Chamber has previously reported to the inspection agencies of Zhejiang Province and reported by the business community that some people were holding national goods certificates issued in the name of this Chamber, selling cotton textiles to Zhejiang Province, which resulted in detention. It was found that a Mr. Zhang in this city was specializing in this type of collection business, deceiving in the name of the chamber, so that legitimate businesses were mistakenly deceived by him. The chamber has entrusted lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. According to recent reports,

Another Case Discovered

There are other people in the business of impersonating certificate collection on behalf of cotton cloth companies. In order to prevent the business community from being deceived again, this chamber has to announce the key points of handling certificates to the public again. It must be known that for factories and firms applying for national goods certificates, such as the cotton cloth industry, the machine dyeing and weaving industry, the knitting industry, etc., all industries that already have the organization of the industry association must first have the factory and firm fill out an application form and report it to the association for verification and collection. This chamber

Will Not Issue Certificates

If There is no association to verify and forward. Moreover, for the sale of cotton textiles, the original factory receipts of where the raw materials or their products were purchased must first be submitted to the association for verification and then registered with this chamber before the goods can be sold with the registration endorsed and certificates issued separately. The procedures are extremely strict, and everything must go through the association. How can any private person collect certificates on behalf of the factories and firms? In the future, if there are any people who claim that they can collect national goods certificates on behalf of this chamber and deceive factories and firms, it is hoped that they will be reported directly to the police station or this chamber. We will definitely prosecute the cases together. This announcement."

### Housing Eviction Dispute; Landlord Wins Appeal

The case of Jiang Zhongjia, the owner of the Jiang Zhongji Construction Factory, and Zhu Juexian, regarding the confirmation of lease disputes, has complex content. Zhu Juexian is not a tenant living in the house. His younger brother, Zhu Juemin, is a foreman in Jiang Zhongji's factory and originally lived in Dongjiadu in the South City. After the war, Jiang Zhongjia seeing that he had no house to live in, provided him with the downstairs house at No. 64 Luban Road completely for his residence, without charging rent. In the 27th year, Jiang Zhongji contracted the construction of the Guangxi railway bridge project and sent Zhu Juemin to be in charge of it. However, the house was taken over and replaced by his mother-in-law, Shen Zhu, who privately paid rent of 15 yuan per month from January of the 28th year. Jiang Zhongjia filed a lawsuit with the court to demand the eviction of the house on the grounds that there was no lease relationship with Shen Zhu. The Second Special Court ruled that the lease relationship between the two parties should continue to be valid. Jiang Zhongjia was dissatisfied with the ruling and appealed. After a detailed examination by the Third Branch Court, the judgment was pronounced the day before yesterday, stating in the main text, "The original judgment is changed. The plaintiff's lawsuit and the request for provisional execution are rejected. The costs of litigation in the first and second instances are borne by the plaintiff."

### Central Grand and New Hotels: Several Men and Women Arrested – Japanese Military Police Collaborate with the Constabulary in the Arrest – Rumored Cause is Forging “Passes”

Yesterday at 5:00 PM, two Japanese military police officers, along with police officers from the Hongkou Constabulary, first went to the Central Constabulary to request additional Chinese and Western detectives. They then traveled by car to Room 202 on the second floor of the Grand New Hotel at 108 Hubei Road, where they arrested five young men and women (three men and two women). It was said that the two women were both dancers. The occupations of the other three men were unknown. It was later learned that the room had been rented by a guest three days prior. The guest was named Xu Guoliang, a local resident, and appeared to be quite young, dressed in a Western-style suit and leather shoes. After the five men and women were taken to the constabulary, they confessed that there were other accomplices hiding in Room 520 on the fifth floor of the Central Hotel on the same road, in a place nicknamed "Yanziwo" (Swallow's Nest). At 6:45 PM, the Japanese military police again collaborated with police officers and went to the "nest" to arrest two men. Around 10:45 PM, they returned to a certain room in the Central Hotel and arrested two young women. Until midnight, detectives remained on guard in the rooms of the Grand New Hotel and other locations.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:

According to our client, Chen Renhao, regarding the case of suspected forgery and fraud brought against him, although the first instance trial has concluded, he has filed an appeal, which is currently pending. However, in the "Local News" section of the Shen Bao on the 30th of this month, an article titled "Bank Employee Commits Fraud and Embezzlement; Appeal Rejected; Chen Renhao Still Held to Original Verdict" was published, claiming that the appeal case was concluded yesterday and the appeal was rejected. This is clearly a fabrication intended to mislead the public. We request that you correct this information to clarify the facts.

Sincerely,

Jiang Rong, Attorney at Law

### Bombing Case on Fulilu Road: Russian Detective Killed by Bomb – Received Tip About Hidden Firearms in House – Explosion Upon Opening Door Injures Chinese Detective

Around 1:00 PM yesterday, police detectives from the French Constabulary were searching No. 80 Fulilu Road when a hand grenade unexpectedly exploded on the spot, resulting in the tragic death of Russian detective Ivanov. Earlier, the French Constabulary received an anonymous phone call stating that firearms and ammunition were hidden at the aforementioned location. Inspector-General Perrier, along with Russian detective Ivanov and several other detectives, rushed to search the premises. As Ivanov and others were about to enter a room on the third floor of the house, two hand grenades were found attached to the door. As soon as the door was opened, they immediately exploded. Ivanov was the first to be hit and sustained severe injuries all over his body, resulting in his immediate death. Another Chinese detective was also injured in his right hand. It was learned that Ivanov was 43 years old and a former officer in the Russian army. He had served in the French Constabulary for 13 years.

### Report from the Sichuan Education Commissioner: Progress in Preparing National Education (1) – Five-Year Plan Completed Three Years Ahead of Schedule – Funding, Teachers, and Methods All Stipulated

(Chengdu Airmail News) When the Sichuan Provincial National Education Committee held a meeting on July 11, Commissioner Guo Youshou reported during the meeting on the "Progress of Preparing National Education in Sichuan Province." He described the various plans in great detail. The report is recorded as follows: "Since Sichuan Province was ordered in September of the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929] to implement the new county system starting in March of this year, the implementation of national education has also been planned simultaneously. Now, the plans have been finalized and it has been decided to start implementation from August of this year. The progress of the preparations is reported separately as follows:

Formulation of Implementation Methods

Since receiving the order to implement the new county system, the Education Department immediately dispatched personnel in charge of national education and civil affairs personnel in charge of local autonomy to discuss implementation methods. After several exchanges of views, a draft plan for the implementation of national education was drawn up. In November of last year, this plan was taken to Chongqing to seek instructions from the Acting Chairman and the Ministry of Education. The Ministry stated that national education should be popularized nationwide in five years, but Sichuan Province, as the location of the wartime capital, has become the base for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. It is proposed to complete it in three years to establish the foundation for a new national education system. After approval from the Acting Chairman and the Ministry of Education, and in accordance with the guidelines of the Acting Chairman, the Sichuan Provincial Implementation Measures for Establishing Township Central Schools and Bao National Schools were drafted and submitted to the 359th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee for approval. Furthermore, it was believed that the smooth implementation of these measures depended on the joint efforts of the commissioners of each district and the magistrates of each county. Therefore, during the first and second Commissioners' Meetings, each commissioner was invited to contribute their opinions as much as possible for reference and revision. In March of this year, the Ministry of Education convened a national education meeting for each province and city, which included much discussion on the implementation of national education. At the same time, the Ministry of Education promulgated the National Education Implementation Guidelines and the Essential Points for Establishing Township Central Schools, which differed somewhat from the measures established in this province. Therefore, when this province convened a provincial normal education and education inspection meeting, the province's national education implementation measures were discussed in detail, regarding how to comply with the regulations of the central government. The Education Department, based on the resolutions of the central government and provincial meetings and the regulations of the National Education Implementation Guidelines, revised the previously established implementation measures and submitted them to the 380th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee for approval and implementation. The key points of the measures are: In the first year, each township will establish one central school, and at least one national school will be established for every three bao. In the second year, at least two national schools will be established for every three bao. In the third year, one national school will be established for each bao. At the same time, the Outline of the National Education Plan for Sichuan Province, the Distribution Table of Newly Added Classes in Each County and City in Sichuan Province for the Three-Year Implementation of National Education, and the Points to Note for the Planned Implementation of National Education in Each County and City in Sichuan Province were also drafted and promulgated separately. Currently, the laws and regulations related to national education have been compiled into the first volume of the Essentials of National Education Implementation Measures, and other relevant laws and regulations are still being compiled.

Approval of Funding

According to the regulations of the Outline of the National Education Plan for Sichuan Province, 20,000 primary school classes must be added each year for three years. The funding required for adding classes in the first year is 16 million yuan, 32 million yuan in the second year, and 48 million yuan in the third year. In the first year, 50% should be raised by each county locally, which should be 8 million yuan. 25% should be subsidized by the province and the central government respectively, which should be 4 million yuan. In the second year, 60% should be raised by each county locally, which should be 19.2 million yuan. 20% should be subsidized by the province and the central government respectively, which should be 6.4 million yuan. In the third year, 70% should be raised by each county locally, which should be 33 million yuan. 15% should be subsidized by the province and the central government respectively, which should be 7.2 million yuan. The funding for teacher training requires 5.4 million yuan each year, with half being raised by the central government and the province respectively, which is 2.7 million yuan. These figures have been submitted to the Ministry of Education and the provincial government for approval. The subsidy for national education in Sichuan Province for the second half of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940] has been approved at 2.2 million yuan (of which 200,000 yuan will be used to run provincial normal schools). After the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941], it should be re-approved when preparing the annual budget. The Ministry of Education has approved the central government's subsidy for the first year: 3.5 million yuan for increasing schools and classes, and 900,000 yuan for subsidizing teacher training. In the second year, 6.3 million yuan for increasing schools and classes, and 720,000 yuan for teacher training. In the third year, 7.28 million yuan for increasing schools and classes, and 720,000 yuan for teacher training. In the second half of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], the central government's subsidy for national education should be 2.2 million yuan, which, together with the provincial subsidy of 6.2 million yuan, totals 8.4 million yuan. The use and distribution of this subsidy are as follows: (1) 1.6 million yuan for training teachers, which, together with 200,000 yuan for running normal schools, totals 1.8 million yuan; (2) 2 million yuan for subsidizing the increase of classes in each county and city; (3) 300,000 yuan for printing teaching materials; (4) 50,000 yuan for guidance fees; (5) 50,000 yuan for assisting border areas; (6) 200,000 yuan for special subsidies for early completion of national education in each district. However, the method of distributing, managing, and auditing the use of this funding will be properly drafted by the National Education Committee. (To be continued)

### Guangdong Education Department Holds the Second Session

(Hong Kong Correspondence) In order to assess the qualifications of secondary school teachers, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education is now continuing to hold the second session of the secondary school teacher exemption assessment. It has also issued an order to registered secondary schools in Hong Kong that all teachers who have not participated in the first assessment must apply for assessment. When applying, the application form must be filled out clearly, and the diploma, teacher appointment letter, and any writings should be sent by registered mail to the Secondary School Teacher Exemption Assessment Committee of the Shaoguan Education Department. The application period is from the date of receipt of the department order to the end of August. In addition, more than 5,000 people applied for the first Guangdong Provincial Secondary School Teacher Exemption Assessment held in the 26th year of the Republic [i.e., 1937]. The review was completed in batches in the previous year, and certificates were issued and documents were returned. For those who have not received them due to the impact of the war, the Education Department has entrusted Guangzhou University in Hong Kong to handle this matter and has notified all those assessed to go and collect them. However, there are still hundreds of people who have not collected them. The university has issued another notice to collect them within one week; it will not be responsible for safekeeping them after the deadline.

### Upsets in the Hezhong Cup Basketball Tournament: Shanghai Qing Sadly Loses to Qunyi – "Big Cat" Absent, Forced to Finish with Four Players – Second Division Match: Muer Overcomes Zhongyi

In the Hezhong Cup charity basketball tournament, Shanghai Qing played Qunyi again yesterday in the first division. Shanghai Qing's star player Sun Hupei ("Big Cat") was unable to play due to a foot injury, which greatly impacted their strength. Qunyi, on the other hand, learned from their crushing defeat in the previous game and sought to avenge themselves. After a major adjustment to their lineup, they were much stronger. Relying on the efforts of its players, Shanghai Qing took the lead at every turn, but Qunyi closely followed, creating an extremely tense situation. At halftime, Shanghai Qing was only one point ahead at 25 to 24. After switching sides, the competition remained fierce, but Shanghai Qing maintained its lead advantage. Unexpectedly, Wang Qiang and Wang Cai Gao of Shanghai Qing were sent off with four fouls each, and they had to play with only four players. Qunyi seized the opportunity and broke away three minutes before the end, finally winning by luck with a score of 55 to 50. This caused another upset in the tournament. In another match in the second division, Muer defeated Zhongyi with a score of 32 to 16. Muer also led at halftime with a score of 15 to 7.

### Finance: Buying Sentiment Prevails, Gold Market to Rise and Be Difficult to Fall – Recent High Price Reaches 5,500 Yuan

Yesterday, the spot cash market, under-the-table trading, and buying sentiment all became stronger, and operators were all satisfied. This is because the exchange rate is tight, and rumors of a Japanese military landing on the coast and the scaling back of the listing by the Chongqing Central Bank are sufficient to affect people's minds with a firming underlying trend. Like fuel on the fire, the midday market was still flat, initially opening at 5,400 yuan, reaching a high of 5,408 yuan. Securities firms bought more, and money changers sold from time to time. The midday close was 5,400 yuan. After the afternoon opening, it immediately rose to 5,430 yuan. Later, it was heard that the exchange rate was tight and the above rumors arose, and the price rose to 5,500 yuan. It was heard that securities firms were busy buying and selling. Besides money changers Gao and You, there were very few sellers. Before the close, retail investors liquidated a considerable amount, so it rose by 97 yuan. Overall trading was still strong, about 3,000 liang [taels] or so. Jewelry stores raised the price of gold ornaments by 10 yuan in the end. Customs gold and other items remained flat.

Spot Cash Rises 97 Yuan

From the morning, each 1,000 liang [taels], initially, because people's minds were nervous, there were many buyers when it opened. The first gold dealers did 20 liang [taels] between each other, at 5,400 yuan, 17 yuan higher than the previous day. Then, because a money changer was vigorously acquiring, it continued to raise by 5 yuan. Silver houses did 30 liang [taels] between each other, at 5,405 yuan. But after this, a certain money changer suddenly dumped, and after the U.S. dollar note rose and fell back, buyers decreased. Silver houses sold 30 liang [taels] to jewelry businesses, lower at 5,385 yuan. Fortunately, money changers and silver houses and others came back to search and buy, and at that time, the U.S. dollar note recovered, so it all surged to 5,408 yuan. The buying wind dissipated at midday and once retreated to within the 5,400 yuan level, but the midday close was 5,400 yuan. After the close, because the exchange rate was slightly tight, the U.S. dollar note did well, and gold dealers and securities firms competed to buy, and finally, the midday close price rose by another 10 yuan, and it was still difficult to find sellers. People's minds were even firmer after the afternoon opening, and they all looked higher, shouting 30 yuan higher than the midday close. Silver houses sold 20 liang [taels] to jewelry businesses, at 5,430 yuan. Then, because the foreign exchange rate was tight, people's minds were especially shaken, and securities firms and retail investors and others vigorously bought. Soon, it skyrocketed another 50 yuan. Securities firms bought 80 liang [taels] from silver houses and others, at 5,480 yuan. After that, the buying wind subsided slightly, and money changers took the opportunity to release at a high price, once falling back a little 15 yuan. Silver houses sold 30 liang [taels] to securities firms, at 5,465 yuan. After entering the market again, the buying intention of securities firms sprouted again, and they came back to frantically search, and it soared another 35 yuan. Gold dealers sold 20 liang [taels] to silver houses, rising to 5,500 yuan, the recent highest price. At the close, money changers with long positions took profits and sold, and floating longs also sold, and it fell back a little 20 yuan. Gold dealers sold 20 liang [taels] to securities firms, at 5,480 yuan, as the late closing price. As a result, it rose 97 yuan compared to the previous day. The market situation was still firm after the close, at 5,495 yuan. There were a small number of sales open, with a fluctuation of 115 yuan for the whole day. The cash gold of the gold dealers' own brand was sold at a slightly higher price than the spot cash market by several yuan, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few open sales.

Gold Ornaments Raised 10 Yuan in the Afternoon

Jewelry gold was still suspended at 550 yuan per liang [tael] when it was initially sold, but at around 2 p.m., it began to rise by 10 yuan. It is estimated that Datong Hang changed the suspension to 560 yuan, and the new peers were similar to the above price, reducing the purchase price by about 30 yuan.

### Exchange Rate Fluctuations: A Larger Range

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange rates showed a tightening trend. Besides numerous foreign firms settling accounts, there were also favorable rumors, such as Japanese troops landing on the coast and the Central Bank of Chongqing reducing its listed rates, causing sellers to hold back. Speculators actively increased their positions. However, the British gold rate remained steady in the morning session, while the American exchange rate reached $6.03125. By the afternoon, the aforementioned rumors spread, triggering significant buying, and the American exchange rate reached $6, threatening to break through. Fortunately, foreign and American banks had ample supply, and the market calmed down. In the end, the British gold rate was 3 pence 859375, and the American exchange rate was $6, with the British rate falling 0.015625 and the American rate tightening 0.03125 compared to the previous day's close. The futures trend mirrored the spot market.

Hong Kong Cable Brings Settlement Advances

Early morning saw London large bars up 1.875, distant contracts up 0.0625. New York silver prices remained stable, and London raw gold was fixed. The exchange rate between British and American currencies was unchanged, and also stable against Shanghai. The American currency was up half a point against the British currency, and slightly up two points against Shanghai. There was no market for the exchange rate against the French currency. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 pence 875 for British gold and $6.0625 for the American exchange rate, both unchanged compared to the previous evening's close. There was a lack of buyers after the opening. Sterling was once quoted at 3 pence 890625. Subsequently, a cable from Hong Kong quoted this month's sterling, with the Netherlands and East Asia offering 3 pence 875. HSBC's listed rates were announced unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced to increase by 1.25%. After this, the market was stable. Speculators and American banks sold to firms like Arnhold this month's American exchange rate at $6.0625. However, after 10:30 AM, foreign firms suddenly entered the market to settle accounts, and this month's American exchange rate price slightly softened. At that time, the buying price for foreign firms' American exchange rate was from $6.0625 to 0.03125, and next month's American exchange rate price was $6. However, the situation was still stable until the noon close. In the end, the British gold rate was 3 pence 875, and the American exchange rate was $6.03125, with the British rate being stable and the American rate slightly tighter by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening.

American Exchange Rate Closes at $6

The afternoon gradually saw a tightening trend, due to rumors of Japanese troops landing on the coast and the Central Bank of Chongqing reducing its listed rates. Consequently, foreign firms were aggressively settling accounts, and speculators were also buying in. Initially, the American bank sold this month's American exchange rate to firms like Arnhold at $6.03125. Later, foreign firms entered the American bank and quoted $6. For August, Chinese speculators and foreign firms bought in Sassoon on the mainland at $5.96875. Until the evening close, there was little change. In the end, the British gold rate was 3 pence 859375, and the American exchange rate was $6. The British gold rate for September was 3 pence 84375, and the American exchange rate was $5.96875. Compared to the previous day's evening close, both the British gold rate in the spot and futures markets contracted by 0.015625, the American exchange rate in the spot market tightened by 0.0625, and the futures market contracted by 0.03125.

Hong Kong American Dollar Alone Tightens

Hong Kong, 30th (Tuesday) Cable: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The spot rates for both British and Shanghai currencies opened at the original levels. The spot rate for the American currency tightened by 0.0625, to $23.375 (the previous close was $23.375). The spot rate for the Japanese currency contracted by half a yuan, to $98.5. At 9:45 AM, the spot rate for the Shanghai currency rose by one yuan, to $384. It was flat at 11:30 AM. There were no gains or losses among the various currencies. The market opened flat at 2:30 PM and remained calm without changes.

Tianjin Exchange Market Also Contracts

Tianjin, 30th (Tuesday) Cable: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The spot rate for the British currency tightened by 0.03125, to 3 pence 59375. The spot rate for the American currency contracted by 0.0625, to $5.625. The Shanghai currency decreased by half a yuan, to $107. The unofficial "Joint Note" rate was cheapened by four cents, to $94.15.

### Foreign Currency Surge Intensifies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw an intensified surge. The British and American gold pounds also rose rapidly, resulting in an increase of $2.50 each. The demand for British gold notes was strong, and the price rose by 30 cents. With the black market American exchange rate already contracted to the $6 level, there were even more favorable rumors in the afternoon, leading to strong buying. The evening market was as high as $16.75, continuing to rise by 30 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose by one cent following the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. The demand for Japanese and Korean gold notes was increasingly strong, and the market prices uniformly rose. The former was as high as $1.25, and the latter was $1.085.

### July Interbank Transfer Deposit Interest: $6 Per Thousand

The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee has set the interbank transfer deposit interest for July at $6 per thousand (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 6%), a decrease of $1.50 compared to the previous month.

### Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Fall

Yesterday's securities grey market saw the last day for the ninth-term interest, but the market surprisingly rebounded slightly. Market sentiment suddenly turned weak. Rumors of a Japanese attack on Vietnam and a large rise in gold prices made people feel even more disheartened. Starting today, interest calculations are excluded. The actual interest received is $2.85, but it needs to be collected in six installments, so the actual amount is about $2.70. Therefore, the market price should be connected to this type of calculation after excluding interest. Because the future loses the support of interest, it may ease slightly. Yesterday's trading showed unsustainability in the morning. The bulls frequently sold out. The bearish sentiment was even stronger in the afternoon. Type B broke through $4, and Type C also broke into the $2 level. Market sentiment suddenly weakened. Various households entered and exited, with Changchun Tongkang and No. 38 consistently buying in. Others, such as Gong Mao, Defu, Renchang, and Xinfu, also had needs, but the selling sentiment was stronger. For example, Yihong, Hongda, Yichang, Shengda, Da, and No. 64 were continuously released, or spot goods flowed out, so the bulls were never able to raise their heads. Among them, Type D had little trading, and the market price was still able to stand firm. The others uniformly fell by 20 to 35 cents. The total transaction volume was estimated at more than $1.1 million. A simple table is listed below:

Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Compared to Previous Day

Unified A	63.20	62.95	63.05	Down 0.20

Unified B	54.00	53.90	53.90	Down 0.20

Unified C	52.45	51.90	51.95	Down 0.30

Unified D	51.50	51.10	51.40	Up 0.05

Unified E	2.40	52.15	2.15	Down 0.35

There were no-ticket transactions, with 100 shares of Chengxiao New Company stock traded at a price of $9.50. Yesterday's stock market in the Public Industry Association fluctuated uncertainly, mostly swayed by various news. The opening market was sluggish and soft. Later, it rebounded slightly. Finally, due to the news that the Dutch Indian government would impose an additional 5% tax rate on exports of rubber, tin, and oil in addition to the current tariffs, prices immediately softened again. The tightening foreign exchange in the afternoon clearly helped the stock market. The market closed with excellent morale.

London, 29th (Monday) Cable: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British South public stocks saw a slight weakness in Chinese foreign bonds, with English and French loans and British and French bond notes falling by £5, priced at £35. Guangdong Railway loans and non-issued bond notes fell by £2. Beijing-Shanghai Railway bonds fell by £1, all priced at £12. The rest were unchanged. Stocks were generally stable, with only the Macquarie Bank stock price increasing by 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £6 and 15 shillings. There were no other gains or losses.

### Grains: Another 50,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive, Market Prices Suppressed and Difficult to Rise, Only Japonica Rice Rises by About Two Yuan

The current foreign rice market, after turning firm once before yesterday afternoon, still saw sellers holding up the market in the early morning. For example, No. 1 Chen Saigon was priced at $53-54, and Fire-hulled at $51-52. However, sales were not good. Guests saw that the source was continuous and the inventory was sufficient. There was no possibility of a high rise. The market was neither soft nor firm. The market was not soft, but peoples' hearts were discouraged. Although the shouts gradually fell, it was difficult to arouse buying interest. As a result, it was known for being flat and tired. The closing price of No. 1 Chen Saigon was still $51-52. Road goods once rebounded by half a yuan in the early market, but immediately went down all the way. The reason was that the inventory was too large and peoples' hearts were weak. As soon as it rose, it fell, and it was difficult to last. The rice of the Road goods that has already arrived is to be handed over immediately. The No. 2 rice opened early at $58.5, which seemed to be able to stand firm at the same time as the current rice. Unexpectedly, new stocks disappeared and were waiting and watching, while the thin-capitalized firms and floating scattered customers were unwilling to stick to it again, and immediately depreciated to seek relief. The price immediately fell from $58, $57.5-6, $57, to as low as $56.5, which was $1.5 less than the previous closing price. Saigon No. 2's July shipments opened early at $57, and then fell from $56.5 to as low as $55.5, which was $3.5 less than the previous opening price of $59. The June shipment of small-hulled rice opened at $58.5 and $58, but later the importing households did not continue to open, and the transaction volume was more than 400 tons. 5,000 bags of current rice, 2,000 bags of early-season Jiangbei Indica rice newly arrived, because the price of foreign rice was small, only opened at $47.5 to $47.

A large amount of foreign rice is coming one after another. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship arrived in Shanghai, carrying 12,006 bags from Hong Kong. The Ninghai ship also arrived at the port at the same time, also carrying 13,931 bags from Hong Kong. The ships were all docked at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. In addition, the Norwegian ship Herlaik, managed by the Gaodeng Foreign Company, directly carried more than 25,000 bags from Saigon. It arrived at the port at 5 PM yesterday and docked at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

Although there is not much glutinous rice, it is still difficult to gain a foothold due to the competition of foreign glutinous rice. The price has depreciated by one yuan. It is heard that the Jin brand is $56-57, the Changdan white brand is $54-55, the Hong Kong white brand is $55, and the next is $53.

The price of thick and thin Japonica rice rises separately. When the incoming goods arrive intermittently, it is rumored that the off-market grey market is firm and rising when the price of foreign rice is tight, or the transaction is quite large, and the selling price is uniquely doubled by about two yuan. Chang Fresh Qing Japonica is $65.5, $65, Wuxi Qing Japonica is $64, Changzhou Japonica is $62-63, and the next is $60, and Su is about $58. Qingsi Thin Rice is $64-65, to $62-63, and Nangang Fresh Gao Hu Early Rice is $58.5, $58, etc.

### Southeast Asian Flour Sales Move Slightly

Flour

Trading was slightly more active yesterday. Since the No. 2 flour mill changed to $15, some of the people who use miscellaneous brand flour have changed to factory flour. Therefore, the number of batches of the two factories has continued to increase to about 6,000 bags. Moreover, the Southeast Asian gang also felt that the factory price was cheaper, and the appetite moved slightly. It is estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 bags of Kaitian Bamboo brand, etc. were sold at a price of $16. The supply and demand of other Japanese factory flour and mainland flour were both silent. The price of Phoenix brand was only $13.5, and there was still no formal transaction.

Wheat

Yesterday's wheat market was still in a stalemate. Although the stock in Hongkou and Zhabei has been abundant recently, the selling price has been suppressed a lot by the Japanese factories. The goods owners are mostly unwilling to depreciate again due to the difficult transportation procedures. Therefore, apart from the Chinese factories slightly taking in 1,000 to 2,000 bags throughout the day, the rest were lacking in sales. The price was $20.065.

### Yarn & Cotton: Cotton Yarn Production and Consumption Cannot Balance, Double Horse Falls Back More Than Ten Yuan

The yarn market, which had risen for two consecutive days, fell back again yesterday. The reason is that actual sales have not seen large-scale development, so a new buying trend has not started. Moreover, the large households who had taken in goods for several consecutive days also stopped buying because their prices had risen. At this stage, the table was slightly stagnant and turned into a downward trend. Some profit-makers were active in selling out, and as a result, the market fell again. The root problem is that inventories are increasing day by day, and production and consumption cannot balance.

In the early morning, the current yarn market showed a lively and enthusiastic appearance of the bulls. The shouts were loud. In fact, the prices can only be raised after the price is raised. There is a lack of .... The household that .... under the circumstances of .... has not much desire for .... Seeing the threshold of 1,000 yuan, .... force out, .... compete to .... because .... against .... downwind, the opening price is 985 yuan. After shouting for a long time, no new prices were seen, and it fell back to 975 yuan. However, after the closing, .... to 968 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, there were 1,815 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse fell by more than ten yuan. Today, 70 pieces of yarn were transported to Haikou, 950 pieces were transported to Hong Kong, and 140 pieces were transported to Xiamen. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:

Same Trade	1,250	Hong Kong	535

Xiamen	10	Mainland	20

Total	1,825

### Japanese Factories Reduce Work, Cotton Market Weakens Further

The current cotton situation has entered a sluggish path again. The factories are still taking in large quantities of goods, but in fact, the yarn market cannot rise actively, and there is little intention to compensate for raw materials. As for the Japanese factories, they occasionally add to their purchases, but the payment period is still delayed by one month. And the overseas sources are constantly connected, so the cotton market has little hope of major growth in the short term.

Another message, the price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, initially due to the high prices of spot goods, the latter due to Southern gang, the result of the price was down three, India market yesterday, together with forecast fell three rupees more.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading has been very quiet these days. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude because of the end of the month. Japanese factories have a low inventory and sluggish yarn sales. It is said that there are reductions in working hours. Transactions between colleagues are very rare.

### Miscellaneous Grains: New and Old Soybeans Do Not Connect, Market Is Exceptionally Advantageous

The soybean market is very firm and smooth because the old goods have dried up, the new goods have not yet entered the market, and the sales are still available. The goods that are stored in general, which used to be considered as inferior goods, are now regarded as high-status, and are still regarded as rare goods. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags of Anqing beans were purchased from Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou and other streets, priced at $28.5 to $29.7. More than 300 bags of Bengbu beans were purchased, priced at $26.58. 50 bags of Pudong Society beans were purchased, priced at $29.7. 60 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow were purchased, priced at $26. Also today, 3,700 bags of soybeans were transported to Xiamen, and 950 bags were transported to Hong Kong. 270 bags of raw peanuts were transported to Hong Kong together, and 150 bags of raw oil, and 300 bags of high, were all transported to Xiamen.

### Coal: Coal Balls Rise Again and Again, Adding Another $8 Per Ton

The coal ball market has risen again by $8 yesterday since the association started to regulate prices some time ago. It is estimated that the coal balls of Yitaixing, Nanyang, etc., are sold by the same industry at $120 per 100 tons if picked up by themselves, and $126 if delivered. Retail sales in the streets are $6.80 per load, which is another 40 cents higher than yesterday.

### Sugar Market: Dutch Sugar Prices Rise

Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association set the market prices: Second and Fourth Grade coarse white sugar was priced at 67 yuan for local warehouse stock, and 65.7 to 66 yuan for foreign warehouse stock. In the afternoon, due to news of rising coarse sand prices in the Netherlands (11.125 yuan), market sentiment improved. As a result, foreign warehouse stock was offered at 67 yuan, but no transactions were made. Transit goods were priced at 52.2 yuan. Jardine Matheson’s “B” mark sugar, March arrival, was priced at 71.5 yuan for old stock, and Western warehouse new stock at 71.8 yuan. Yesterday, the Guangdong brokers offered 200 bags of Dongxiang ordinary red sugar at a price of 52 yuan. Yesterday, 5,710 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

### Re-copying Old Newspapers: 67 Years Ago (461) (See This Newspaper from the 12th Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)

Mining in Guizhou Province

Zhao Yuan, believing that Guizhou Province is rich in sand ore, memorialized the court, intending to engage in mining to enrich the country and benefit the people. His memorial stated: "Guizhou Province is all mountains, and the dense Qi should produce various kinds of sand ore. However, the previous mines are already old and depleted. It is difficult for wealthy merchants to come and exploit them, because the treasure is hidden in the ground and cannot be guaranteed to be obtained. People are doubtful, and few are willing to undertake it. When I was serving as the Provincial Treasurer, I once drafted detailed regulations and issued them to attract merchants, but few responded. Furthermore, I selected officials and gentry familiar with mining to conduct surveys in various places. Where ore deposits were found, there was a lack of capital to mine them, leading to many interruptions. Currently, auxiliary funds are insufficient, and the financial situation is precarious. I must seek natural benefits in the midst of unsolvable problems. It has been found that in the area under the jurisdiction of Luo Jiezhou, the Sub-Prefect of Guihua, the mountains of Ma'an, Dabao Cliff, Shatougou, etc., have strong sand Qi, and are surrounded by peaks, with water in the center, posing no hindrance to civilian farmland, residences, or graves. It is proposed that the government should first conduct trial mining to encourage capable gentry and merchants to start mining. I, along with the Chief Secretary and Circuit Intendant, will discuss using idle funds, appoint officials to supervise, and send soldiers to suppress disturbances. If we can be blessed by the court and the mountains and rivers respond, and the mining is successful, in addition to converting the ore into regular revenue, we will also report to the court to levy taxes according to regulations to enrich the treasury. If the mining is unsuccessful, we will stop work to avoid wasting resources. I dare not spare the effort of careful management, but due to the lack of resources and funds in the barren land, it is necessary to do so."

Spring and Autumn

### The Struggle Between Reason and Emotion

— Ren Wei

According to a report on the 27th, a Shanghai man named Jin Hongcai, due to prolonged unemployment and lack of livelihood, had his wife leave him. He then threw a three-year-old girl into the river (presumably to reduce the burden?), but his skills were poor, and he was discovered by dockworkers, resulting in his arrest and a sentence of two years and several months.

The wife was dissatisfied with her husband's unemployment, which led to quarrels and her departure to seek another path. The father, having no food for himself, abandoned his child. It turns out that human emotions are built on practical life. Should she watch her husband starve to death? Should she leave her husband to find a way to survive? Should she die with the child? Or should she abandon the child to beg for food?

This is similar to the situation of the Sichuan famine a few years ago: a father wanting to kill his son to satisfy his hunger, and a son wanting to kill his father to fill his stomach.

Yes, humans come into the world to live, and that is emotion. But when the world cannot satisfy him, he still wants to find ways to live, regardless of parents, children, regardless of terror, death... everything.

This is the struggle between reason and emotion!

Please allow me to leave a tail. Now this Jin Hongcai has food to eat, within two years and several months.

### The Happiness of Apprentices

— Cao Lingyou

Speaking of the happiness of apprentices, many people will surely criticize my statement. What happiness can apprentices have? They do lowly work every day, and their monthly income is not even enough to buy daily necessities. They also have to endure the boss's temper and often face his cold looks. Being an apprentice is truly living an inhuman life. Where is the happiness in that? Are you crazy to say apprentices are happy? However, I have some reasons for saying apprentices are happy. As the ancient saying goes, "Only when the year grows cold do we know that pine and cypress are the last to fade." It can be seen that the more adverse the environment, the more those who struggle and succeed deserve to be called heroes and heroines in the world. In today's society, I don't know how many successful people have risen from apprentice to boss. Their struggle is truly admirable! The life of an apprentice is indeed very painful, but if an apprentice is willing not to give up on himself, work hard, and strive forward, then success is within reach.

If you often browse biographies of famous people, then you will be even more convinced that apprentices are happy. Of all the successful people, both ancient and modern, I don't know how many came from apprentice backgrounds. During their apprenticeships, they forged strong wills and magnificent courage. When opportunity arrived, they showed their skills, raised their eyebrows, brought blessings to the masses, and became world-renowned figures. I can easily cite a few facts about famous people to prove my point:

The inventor Edison is probably known to everyone. He invented many things and increased the world's civilization. But he was very poor in his youth. When he was a teenager, he worked in his cousin's factory and suffered abuse from his cousin, so he ran away. He lived a miserable life of unemployment. Fortunately, he came across a good opportunity. The stock market counter was broken, and no one else could fix it, but he fixed it. As a result, he gained the approval of the manager in the stock market, who hired him as a vice engineer. From then on, Edison went smoothly, his life had a purpose, and he eventually became the world's king of invention.

The second person I want to talk about is the world-renowned historian H.G. Wells. He was also the son of a servant woman. As a child, he worked as an apprentice in a small grocery store, getting up at dawn and sleeping late at night, spending all day doing the hard work of sweeping the floor and wiping windows. But later, he devoted himself to learning, made unremitting efforts, and became a world-renowned scholar.

Many people have probably read the autobiography of the American Benjamin Franklin. When he was young, he worked as an apprentice in his brother's printing shop. He took time out from his busy schedule to secretly study classical works and eventually became a writer, politician, and scientist.

I want to list the above three great men

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Dancer's Whereabouts

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Hawthorn seemed tempted by my inducement and indeed pointed out something. He said, "How can this woman have so much money? I also have to ask Anna." I said, "Is that even a point? Isn't her money from that sucker Lu Jiansheng being taken for a ride?"

Hawthorn waited a moment, then shook his head slightly. "I don't believe this sucker would be that much of a sucker."

"Why do you say that?"

"Hasn't he recently known that Zhao Boxiong and Wang Lilan are having an affair? I suspect he may not be entirely unaware of her relationship with Yu Gantang either."

I couldn't help but laugh and say, "Hawthorn, your psychological research is indeed very profound, but in my opinion, it's still like a 'flawed encyclopedia'."

At this moment, Hawthorn suddenly slammed on the brakes. I looked up and saw that the red light in the center of the road was on. When the car continued to move, his conversation also had a lingering interest.

He asked me, "What does that mean?" His head kept looking to both sides of the road. I replied, "Your research on the 'sucker psychology' seems to be still incomplete. Shanghai is full of such big shots. On the one hand, they reach out their claws to squeeze the sweat and blood of the common people, but on the other hand, they spend it all on women. They know that their mistresses or illegal cohabitants are hooking up outside, but they can still maintain that kind of 'gentlemanly demeanor' of turning a blind eye and give their all. In fact, this is the law of 'reaping what you sow'!"

Hawthorn didn't seem to hear it, and said to himself, "Ah, this is Songshan Road – that tall building is probably the Kangning Apartment?"

Two seconds later, our car had stopped in front of the eight-story giant building. Hawthorn jumped out of the car first and went straight into the doorman's room of the apartment. After I closed the car door and walked up the stone steps, he came out of the doorman's room and led me into the elevator room. He said, "I have asked, Jiang Anna is upstairs."

"That's for sure. Didn't she say she didn't sleep all night last night?"

The elevator rose to the third floor. As we stepped out of the elevator, I suddenly remembered something and raised my hand to look at my watch. The (61) deeds, are nothing more than to prove that apprentices should not be too pessimistic, but should seize the opportunity to endure, and work hard, then there will always be a day of success. Aren't many celebrities from apprenticeships? The so-called "capable person is like this", I hope those who are apprentices regard themselves as happy. Someone said a very meaningful sentence, he said: "Unfortunately, being born as the son of an official is like being loaded with weight and running a race." This sentence, on the contrary, says that poverty is happiness, and being an apprentice is happiness!

### Thoughts, Sights, and Sounds

— By Weikang

Because of the soaring prices of everything, everyone is planning everywhere. Even writing a quick letter must use a postcard, because writing a letter once (local) requires two cents for postage, two cents for the envelope, and one cent for the paper, which costs five cents in total. But using a postcard only costs one cent. Therefore, the post office's postcard business is booming, but each person is limited to a maximum of several sheets each time, and more will not be sold, in order to slightly limit it.

In the advertisement column of a certain newspaper, I saw an advertisement for a lost dog, which roughly said: A small white Pekingese dog is lost. If someone finds it and sends it back, a reward of one hundred yuan will be given. At the same time, in this column, I also saw an advertisement for finding a child with a reward of five yuan, which makes people sigh that "humans are inferior to dogs."

### Not From Shaoxing

Fundraiser: "Shaoxing is experiencing a rice shortage, and the disaster victims are in urgent need of relief. Your Excellency has always been extremely enthusiastic about good deeds. Please donate some here as well, and your merit will be immeasurable!"

Rich man: "No, I am not from Shaoxing, so I am afraid I cannot comply."

Entertainment World

### My View on Li Shengzao

— By Plum Blossom House Master

Li Hanru (Shengzao) is an outstanding talent of the Fuliancheng Drama School. Among the male leads in this drama school, after Ma Lianliang and Tan Fuying, the one with the most outstanding artistic talent and the highest reputation is Hanru alone. Hanru's art is generally learned from Lianliang. His singing and acting both have similarities. The role of Qiao Xuan in Ganlu Temple is even more like Ma. Not only is his singing the same, but his expressions and movements are also the same. This is due to his extraordinary intelligence, which is something that ordinary people cannot achieve by forced learning. When he first came to Shanghai (with the Tianchan Stage, accompanied by the Sheng generation disciples of Fushe), I watched his plays more than ten times. At that time, Hanru was still young, but his acting skills were already very mature. He and Chen Shengsun co-starred in "Si Lang Visits His Mother," and he and Liu Shenglian co-starred in "Sitting in the Tower Killing Her Husband." Both his singing and acting were excellent, giving the audience a very good impression. I especially appreciated the play "Four Jinshi" that he co-starred with Shenglian, because children who play this kind of acting play often fail to do so stiffly and dryly, while Hanru's performance is impeccable, and he can fully highlight the posture and means of the evil lawyer, which is commendable. The second time he came to the south again, he took the Golden Grand Theater, and his qualifications became more experienced, and his skills also improved accordingly. However, the supporting roles were a bit weak, and he could not show his strengths. This was the fact at the time. How dare I conceal it for Hanru? After returning to the north, he became the main character, and his desire for excellence became more eager. He learned and polished with each other, and only followed what was good, and he worked hard and never stopped learning, so his art has advanced to the Tao. This time, he came back with a vengeance. It is the time for people of ambition to establish a career, and in addition, the female lead, Tong Zhiling, is a new actor who is just starting out, and the martial arts actor Gao Shenglin is even more of a famous role with a solid foundation. With these two people to assist him, the splendor of his performance and the fulfillment of his harvest can be self-evident. What's more, his father, Gao Qingkui, came with him, serving as the stage director and temporary teacher. He will provide more unexpected help in terms of performance. When he takes the stage, I will wait and see.

### Li Qinian's General Reply to Her Supporters

Li Qinian sent a letter to the Haixing News Agency yesterday, stating that since she came to Shanghai, she has received many letters from her supporters. Among the questions raised, the following three are the most common. Now, she is sending the replies to you and asking you to forward them to various newspapers as a general reply.

(1) "I heard that Ms. Li went to Singapore to perform on stage before coming to Shanghai. Can you tell us the details?"

Answer: "Going to Singapore was a process of performing in the Malay Peninsula. I passed through more than twenty cities in the Malay Peninsula, staying for an average of three to five days or one or two days in each place. This trip was at the invitation of Shaw Brothers Company. Along the way, I also performed on stage to raise funds to relieve refugees. Fortunately, the results were good. The whole process took two months."

(2) "What is the situation of the film industry in Southeast Asia?"

Answer: "Southeast Asia is an excellent overseas market for domestic films. Every film that is released can attract a large audience. Therefore, if filmmakers can provide meaningful productions, they will definitely achieve a great publicity effect."

(3) "What are your opinions on the popular folk story films in Shanghai?"

Answer: "After coming to Shanghai this time, I have received written inquiries from several film publications on this issue. I did not pay attention to folk story films at first, and I have not acted in this type of film in the past. Among the more than ten scripts sent by the Yihua authorities for me to choose from, I have not seen any scripts of this type, so I cannot express any opinions."

### Zhang Eyun After Returning to Shanghai

— By Meiyu

Zhang Eyun, the master of Zhuchen Pavilion, stopped performing last year. Seeing the special situation in Shanghai, she went to Hong Kong with Meng Xiaodong for a short rest. Unexpectedly, alarming news came frequently, and a storm was brewing.

Revolutionary Pioneer, starring John Wayne and Crane Wilbur, is a thrilling and exciting story full of calls for freedom and national spirit, and is the prelude to the American independence movement.

### How to Shoot a Movie? (II)

— By Degang

How to start shooting a movie? Before shooting a movie, of course, you must first determine the script. There are many types of scripts, including comedies, tragedies, social dramas, historical dramas, religious dramas, etc. After the director of the film has determined the script, he must turn the empty plot hidden in the ideal into a vivid and colorful object. Being a director is a difficult job, so some people say that the success of a famous film is not due to the leading star, but should be attributed to the director. The first step for the director is to assign different roles in the play according to the personality and talent of each actor, and then determine the scenery. The scenery used in the photography field is much more elaborate than the scenery used in ordinary stages, because the camera lens is like a sophisticated eye, and it will not easily ignore any smallest point. The construction of the scenery is also done by experts, who can use paper and wood to make all kinds of things, such as bulky cannons, majestic warships, and towering palace buildings. After the scenery is ready, you can start shooting. During the shooting, the director先生 stares intently at directing the work, correcting the actors' expressions, postures, movements, dialogues, etc., especially the movements. Generally, inexperienced actors always move too fast, which does not meet the requirements of filming. Because too fast movements appear discontinuous to the audience in the film, which is not very beautiful.

In a film, there are often many scenes that take place in the same location or under the same scenery. In order to save manpower and resources, scenes with the same scenery location but not connected in sequence can be filmed at the same time, and then the films of these unconnected scenes can be cut apart, and after the other scenes have been filmed, the films can be connected one by one in sequence with glue. During the shooting, no matter how attentive the director is, and how hard the actors are working, there are always many sections of the film that are not satisfactory after the shooting, and need to be cut and reshot. Therefore, the length of the film that is cut and reshot is many times longer than the wooden film. For example, a film that is 1,800 or 2,000 meters long when it is shown in a movie theater is at least 10,000 meters long when it is being made. You can imagine how huge the loss of the film is!

Hong Kong is not a paradise either, so she had to replan her return. She bought a boat and returned to China, and arrived safely in Shanghai a few days ago. She still lives near Foch Road. Since returning to Shanghai, Eyun has had little contact with the outside world. She often reads books and writes to pass the time. In terms of scripts, she has only dabbled in Yu Shuang's "Yanzi Jian". This month, she may return to the West Lake for a few weeks, and then go to Tianjin and Gubei, and make a decision on whether to perform or not.

### Twenty Kinds of Suzhou Ballad (16) Rebirth

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Yan Zhi

Rebirth is a narrative of the tribulations and fate of Huangfu Shaohua and Meng Lijun, a pair of affectionate children.

"Good things" are usually "full of twists and turns." Huangfu Shaohua and Meng Lijun tasted a lot of hardships and setbacks in difficult environments.

Ending with a "grand reunion" seems to have become a stereotyped formula for Suzhou ballad novels (Dream of the Red Chamber and Romance of the West Chamber can be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, precisely because they do not fall into common routines in this regard). "Rebirth" of course could not avoid the cliché.

The structure is slightly scattered, and it seems not easy to please when set to music.
