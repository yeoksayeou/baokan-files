### Unprecedented Since the Start of the War: German Air Force Launches Massive Night Raid on Britain; Over 500 Miles of Coastline Under Intense Attack; London Air Raid Alert Lasts Six Hours Before Being Lifted

London: Last night and this morning, German planes dropped hundreds of bombs on the London area and engaged in fierce battles with British fighter planes in the city skies. As of 2:15 AM (7:15 AM Shanghai summer time), the air raid was still in progress, and the sound of planes could still be heard in the city. The air raid alert at 9:30 PM was the longest London had ever experienced. (United Press International dispatch, 27th)

London: From dusk yesterday until dawn today, Hitler launched a major air raid on Britain, the largest nighttime aerial attack Britain has suffered since the start of the war. Over 500 miles of coastline were attacked. It is reported that the areas targeted by enemy aircraft stretched from the northeast, through the Midlands and inland counties, to the southeast. High-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped everywhere. According to a joint statement issued by the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security, 46 enemy aircraft were shot down during yesterday's air raids, and the Royal Air Force lost 15 fighters, but 11 pilots were unharmed. Yesterday, London suffered its seventh air raid in three days. At the time, anti-aircraft fire crisscrossed the sky, mixed with the flashes of distant bombs. Searchlights surrounding the capital illuminated the sky as if it were daytime. Enemy aircraft, either singly or in small groups, appeared over the London area from time to time. Several bombs fell in a certain area outside central London, causing minimal material damage and few casualties. Several bombs also fell in outer London areas. Because enemy aircraft came and went intermittently, the air raid alert in London lasted for about six hours before being lifted. The industrial area of the Midlands suffered damage, but the enemy aircraft also experienced Britain's strong resistance. The duration of the air raids in many areas was unprecedented, but compared to the length of the alert, the number of bombs dropped was small. It seems that the enemy realized that attacking the Royal Air Force with large formations of aircraft would inevitably result in significant losses, so they switched to a method of wanton harassment, making it impossible to lift the air raid alert for a time, which also prevented factories from resuming work for a time. A certain town in southwestern England suffered the worst air raid since the start of the war. Enemy bombers flew in all night, dropping incendiary bombs in all parts of the town and the surrounding area. The extent of the damage and the number of casualties are not yet known. Several fires broke out in the Midlands area after being attacked, and factories in two towns were damaged, injuring some people, including some who lost their lives. Houses were damaged in other areas, but reports from various places indicate that the number of casualties was very small. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Last night, about 200 incendiary bombs fell on a certain area of the northeast coast, but only a few fires broke out. When a certain city in the Midlands was attacked, many high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell, causing considerable property damage. A certain lumberyard caught fire, but the number of casualties was extremely small. Several bombs fell in a certain residential area in the southwest, but the damage was limited to shattering doors and windows. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

German Air Raids Cover a Wide Area

London: The German attempt to launch a large-scale air raid has failed, as can be seen from the Air Ministry's statement issued last night. The statement said that a large formation of enemy aircraft entered the Thames Estuary in the afternoon and flew close to London, but was dispersed by British fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft fire. Some enemy aircraft flew to the Essex area and dropped bombs, causing some loss of life and property. At noon, a squadron of bombers escorted by enemy fighters flew close to the southeast coast, split into several groups, and attacked the barrage balloons over Dover and bombed Folkestone. The remaining enemy aircraft flew slightly inland and were met head-on by British fighters, their formation was disrupted, and they were chased back to sea. Enemy aircraft also attempted to attack the Portsmouth area but failed, and there were no casualties among the residents of that area. Several rural areas were attacked yesterday with slight casualties. The Isles of Scilly were bombed, also without casualties. During the attack on Folkestone, enemy aircraft swooped down and dropped many bombs, which hit and damaged houses in the central area, but did not cause fires, and the casualties were light. A Focke-Wulf German bomber crashed on the beach, and another German aircraft crashed one or two miles inland. A third German aircraft crashed into the sea, and the remaining German aircraft were driven away by British fighters. News from another area in the southeast said that two Messerschmitt German aircraft, which were escorting German bombers across the English Channel, were shot down by Spitfire British aircraft. The German pilots parachuted to the ground, and the British aircraft immediately directed lifeboats to their rescue. The crews of a total of three German aircraft were rescued from the sea. Also, three German aircraft attacked the barrage balloons in Dover, causing two to catch fire and fall. When a large formation of enemy aircraft flew high over the Thames Estuary towards London yesterday, an air raid alert was issued in London, anti-aircraft guns opened fire, and British aircraft also intercepted them head-on. Fifteen minutes after the alert was lifted, there were no reports of damage. One hundred and fifty bombs were dropped on the Isles of Scilly the day before yesterday and yesterday morning. Children on the beach were strafed, injuring several and killing one girl. A certain hotel was strafed for a long time, causing windows to break and the roof to be damaged. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Southern Ireland: Neutrality Not Guaranteed; Air Raids Affect Innocent Bystanders; Protest Lodged with Germany

Dublin: The official announcement stated that yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM, a German bomber flew over the areas of Balleymitty, Penno, and Dunlough, southern Ireland, and dropped bombs on them, destroying a cheese shop. Bricks fell, killing three girls and injuring one. The Southern Ireland Chargé d'Affaires in Berlin has received instructions to lodge a strong protest with the German government and demand full compensation. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Iron Birds Somersault in a Fierce Battle

London: On the 26th, the Germans resumed their aerial blitzkrieg against the British Isles. As of 8:00 PM (5:00 AM Shanghai time this morning), it was known that 37 enemy aircraft had been shot down, and the British had also lost 15 aircraft, but the pilots of six of them had been rescued. Yesterday afternoon, German aircraft came to attack, attempting to reach London but failed. An aerial battle took place in the high clouds above a certain town in the southeast. It is widely believed that eight German aircraft were shot down. A German bomber passed over the roof of a certain farmhouse at close range and crashed into a grain field, where it caught fire and was destroyed. Another three bombers were shot down in a certain area of the southeast coast. Aircraft from both sides engaged in a terrifying aerial battle in the clouds for ten minutes. From the ground, only occasional glimpses of aircraft tumbling through the gaps in the clouds could be seen, but the sound of machine guns and small cannons from the Messerschmitt German aircraft accompanying the bombers could be heard clearly. After a fierce battle, the German aircraft turned and fled. At the time, two German aircraft were seen crashing to the ground, and the sound of bombs landing was heard in the distance. According to a Reuters reporter who witnessed the aerial battle, he saw several plumes of thick smoke rising from all directions, clearly indicating that aircraft had crashed to the ground. Then he saw several British fighter aircraft circling above the smoke for several minutes, apparently checking on the downed German aircraft. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Birmingham Munitions Factory Bombed

Berlin: On Sunday night, 67 German aircraft attacked the Birmingham munitions factory with many 1,000-kilogram bombs. All German aircraft returned safely to their original defenses. This morning, a certain reconnaissance aircraft flew over Birmingham and reported that upon arrival in Birmingham at 8:45 AM, several fires had broken out near the train station, as well as in the Erdington and Bordesley Green areas. Due to poor weather, the extent of the damage is unclear. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

Air Raid Alert Continues in Berlin

New York: According to American newspapers, another air raid alert was issued in Berlin last night. It is reported that after last night's air raid, three streets in Berlin were roped off to prohibit traffic. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Berlin: According to the German official news agency, another general air raid alert was issued in Berlin last night. Several British aircraft attempted to bomb the city, but were forced to turn back by anti-aircraft guns and searchlights near the Brandenburg Gate. One British aircraft flew high over the city, but did not drop any bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

New York: According to a Berlin dispatch from an American news agency, yesterday's morning newspapers all carried large headlines detailing the British attack on Berlin, and especially emphasized the fact that British aircraft circled over Hitler's government building. British bombers flew around the center of the capital, above Hitler's government building and other government departments. The sound of heavy bombs exploding was heard in all the streets. At 2:00 AM, the church bells rang, and the streets were immediately deserted. Men, women, and children throughout the city took refuge in air raid shelters, hearing only the sound of explosions in the distance. But forty minutes later, the explosions resumed, even more violently. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

London Air Ministry announced last night that on August 25, the British Air Force continued to fly over German territory and occupied areas, bombing enemy targets. British bombers first attacked several airfields in occupied Holland and Belgium, and later attacked airfields in northern France after dusk. The attack on the Berlin area on the night of August 25-26 was hampered by bad weather, but military targets were still selected for attack, and the anti-aircraft gun and searchlight teams outside Berlin were treated to heavy bombs. Other British aircraft attacked the military depots in Cologne, Hamm, and Gelsenkirchen, and the shipyard in Brest. British coastal aircraft also bombed the oil depots in Cherbourg, France, the seaplanes and torpedo boats in the port of Boulogne, and the shipyard in Flushing. A total of five British aircraft did not return. Also, a Sunderland seaplane of the British Coastal Command, while patrolling the Tromsø area of Norway, attacked enemy seaplanes moored on the water. Two of them were sunk, one caught fire, and several others were damaged. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

German Side Announces Air Force Battle Results

Berlin: According to the German High Command, German aircraft formations attacked the Portsmouth naval port and airfields and troop concentration areas in southern England. A radio station on the Isles of Scilly was destroyed. Three escort ships were heavily bombed by German aircraft north of Fraserburgh. German aircraft engaged in several fierce battles with British aircraft during the bombing and won victories in all cases. German bomber squadrons attacked the Plymouth naval port, the Cornish airfield, aircraft factories in Birmingham and other places, and the seaports of Hull and Newcastle last night, all of which were hit and caught fire, with particularly heavy losses in Plymouth and Hull. German aircraft continued to lay mines in various British seaports. British aircraft formations bombed various locations in Germany last night, killing two civilians and injuring eight, with very little material damage. Yesterday, British aircraft lost seventy aircraft, of which sixty-one were shot down in aerial combat and nine were destroyed on airfields. Twenty-one German aircraft are missing. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

Berlin: A German military expert told a Haitong News Agency reporter yesterday that from the night of August 24 to the 25th, German aircraft bombed no less than thirty-eight airfields, seaports, factories, and anti-aircraft gun positions on the British Isles. Cardiff, Warrington, Newcastle, Middlesbrough and other places were hit and caught fire. On that night, German aircraft dropped a total of 1,500 bombs, weighing a total of 150,000 kilograms. On the 25th, German aircraft bombed the Warmwell airfield near Portland, with considerable success. Aerial combat with British aircraft occurred in that area, and the German aircraft again prevailed. On the 25th, the British aircraft lost a total of seventy-two aircraft, of which fifty-one were shot down in aerial combat. The German aircraft lost only fourteen aircraft. The British attack on Berlin was the first time since the war. The British aircraft were only able to indiscriminately drop bombs in the suburbs of Berlin with no specific target. According to yesterday's battle report, the submarine commanded by Captain Lösing sank 46,170 tons of enemy ships alone. Other German submarines attacked British escort convoys, sinking four merchant ships, totaling approximately 36,000 tons. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

Britain Guarantees Not to Indiscriminately Bomb Civilians

London: The unprecedentedly fierce attack campaign in world war history is now underway. Britain and Germany are engaged in a war of mutual bombing and retaliation. Only the winter fog may temporarily interrupt it. The Anglo-German air war has gradually trended toward a total war. Germany is attempting to destroy the entire British population through this. In the past three days, the losses suffered by British cities from German air raids have indeed been very heavy. The result, however, is that the British people have not only not lost their courage, but have redoubled their anger and strengthened their determination to fight to the end and not stop until the goal of crushing Hitlerism is achieved. After the indiscriminate bombing of central London, the people, driven by temporary anger, demanded that Britain inflict massive retaliation. However, British Air Minister Sinclair, representing the British government, stated that the British Air Force would never act purely on emotion, indiscriminately bomb and wantonly kill civilians. This is not because the British government is being sentimental, but specifically because the British government feels that it will use bombs to destroy German military targets.

Editorial

### An Analysis of Anglo-American Relations

The always subtle relationship between Britain and the United States has recently become even more subtle and has become a focal point of global attention.

From a historical perspective, the birth of the United States was due to the victory in the War of Independence against Britain; at that time, the British Empire suffered its greatest territorial loss. From an economic perspective, the competition between Britain and the United States is much more intense than that between any other two countries. Furthermore, from the perspective of arms race, the naval arms race between Britain and the United States since the end of the last European war has formed a balanced opposition. These are all obvious and clear historical facts in the international issue of the United States. However, in the continuous evolution of the world situation, a new trend has suddenly formed, namely, that the two countries, Britain and the United States, are gradually moving towards a very consistent and harmonious relationship; all contradictions and conflicts are temporarily no longer being brought up by either side. It is probably impossible for anyone to pinpoint when this new trend began; however, the reasons for its emergence are not difficult to deduce. This is because the German and Italian quest for hegemony in Europe, and their threat to divide the world, made the British Empire feel the crisis of collapse. The United States, on the other hand, was awakened from its peaceful and sweet dream by the smell of gunpowder coming from both east and west, and immediately discovered the unrest in Central and South America. The shared adversity felt by both countries outweighed the contradictions between them, so they gradually realized the necessity of cooperation, and the animosity that had implicitly existed between the two countries for more than ten years suddenly disappeared. This trend, starting years ago and continuing until the eve of the outbreak of war last year, has been improving and progressing day by day. It has finally become close. Looking at the various British publications in June and July of this year, there were even quite a few people who put forward the idea of Britain and the United States immediately merging into one and forming a unified entity. Of course, this is only the ideal of a section of people, but at least it represents a driving force for a trend towards closer cooperation between the two countries, which is undoubtedly the case.

The most basic form of cooperation between Britain and the United States is the so-called American support and assistance to Britain. This is the method that has been used since Britain declared war on Germany last year. The specific content it includes is nothing more than two aspects: (1) The United States systematically imports military supplies, raw materials, food, etc. into Britain to support its war against Germany. It is said that at the beginning of the war, the number of front-line aircraft in Britain and France was far below that of Germany; therefore, with the permission and cooperation of the US government, a large number of aircraft manufacturing companies immediately expanded their equipment and scale, and engaged in all-out production in order to remedy the inferiority of Britain and France in the air against the German air force. Recently, there was also a well-known event in the world, the United States is preparing to sell a part of its destroyer fleet to Britain in bulk. At a time when Britain is stepping up its large-scale naval blockade against Germany and Italy, the fact that the United States is selling Britain the greatest tool for carrying out this naval blockade at this time makes its extraordinary significance even more obvious. These are not ordinary actions between ordinary countries, but are indeed planned cooperation. (2) Since the start of the European war last year, the United States has, on the one hand, tried its best to support the position of Britain and France in public opinion, and condemned and exposed the ambition of Germany and Italy to the world, so that many neutral countries, especially countries in South America and Central America, gradually sympathized with Britain and France, and became estranged from Germany and Italy. (3) The United States stationed most of its navy in the Pacific, forcing eastern aggressors to be extremely vigilant, dispelling the British Empire's worries about its colonies in the Pacific, and enabling it to concentrate on fighting Germany and Italy.

The above-mentioned types of Anglo-American cooperation avoided major difficulties in American domestic politics. However, by June of this year, on the eve of the collapse of France, the ineffectiveness of Anglo-American cooperation in dealing with the crisis had been completely exposed; as long as one reads the emergency telegram sent to the United States by the French Prime Minister Reynaud at the time, this point will immediately become completely clear. However, the democratic system of the United States absolutely cannot take swift measures, so France suffered the fate of collapse. In the past two months, Britain's situation has become even more precarious; therefore, the initial mode of cooperation between the United States and Britain has had to be replaced by a more advanced mode. This new method, as it has developed to the present, can probably be divided into two phases: The first phase is the various arrangements made by the United States in domestic politics for further foreign policy, such as the appointment of Knox, Stimson, and others to important positions, and the passage of the Two-Ocean Navy Act, etc. The second phase is the current period; as in the recent ten or so days, major events that shook the world have come one after another; first, the announcement of the joint defense of the United States and Canada, followed by Britain's formal announcement to give the United States as much convenience as possible to establish defenses in various territories of the Western Hemisphere. These cooperation measures not only sufficiently demonstrate that the United States' attitude toward the European war has gradually evolved from that of a third party to that of an interventionist, but the joint defense of the United States and Canada is particularly tantamount to the United States and the British Empire concluding a partial alliance relationship; and the fact that the British territories in the Western Hemisphere allow the United States to borrow for defense purposes means that the United States is sharing part of the British Empire's territorial defense. The situation is still developing, and it is difficult to say to what extent it will reach. However, just these two actions have given the United States sufficient grounds, and it may be possible to take further action in one fell swoop and directly clash with Germany and Italy at some appropriate time.

Of course, this further action at the moment cannot be determined as implementing participation in the war. Participation in the war is a very complex issue, which must first be decided by the needs of the objective international situation, then by the promotion of American domestic public opinion; and, more importantly, by the actual preparations of the United States. It does not seem to be possible to talk about it in a fairly recent period. In the event that the United States joins the war, the British-American alliance theory that is now being advocated by general idealists will no longer seem as novel and distant as it does now.

Japanese Political System to Undergo Epoch-Making Change; Konoe to Deliver Important Declaration Today; Construction of New Political System Declares Constitutionalism Dead

Tokyo: The entire nation of Japan is currently awaiting Prime Minister Konoe's declaration tomorrow regarding the "New Political Structure." It is expected that Japan will soon undergo a "peaceful revolution," effectively becoming an omnipotent nation. Observers view the new political system as the last stand for the Japanese people against the dictatorship of the army. Today, Japanese sources anticipate that under this new political system, Japan will experience a "peaceful revolution," with changes unprecedented since the Meiji era. The new political system is tantamount to a declaration of the death of constitutionalism. All political parties will be merged into a single new political party. The government can issue any orders after mobilization, and the National General Mobilization Law can be supplemented. This system will not only dissolve all political parties but also prohibit other groups without significant political relevance. Hereafter, "individual freedom" will become a thing of the past in Japan, as those planning this system intend to make the will of the government the will of the entire nation. Movements such as farmer-worker and women's suffrage will end under this new political system. Today's announcement stated that the Japanese Women's Suffrage League will declare its dissolution. All farmer-worker groups have already been abolished. The Japanese government is also making special efforts to sever ties between Japanese groups and foreign groups outside the Axis powers. The future of foreign church groups in Japan is becoming increasingly difficult. Organizations like the Salvation Army may ultimately face extinction under the new political system. Some observers predict conflicts between factions within the new political party system. They point out today that although all political parties have been completely dissolved, their members will effectively be divided into groups and join the new unified party. Old political connections within the new party will still exist and will hinder national unity. Prime Minister Konoe made final revisions to the draft of the new system last night. The content of the plan will be announced to the nation tomorrow. (27th United Press dispatch)

### Construction of New Political System Declaration Ready

Hong Kong: A Tokyo dispatch states that today is the eve of Prime Minister Konoe's declaration on the construction of a new political system. According to the Asahi Shimbun, Prime Minister Konoe, considering the extreme importance of the declaration, has abandoned the idea of issuing it in his personal name and will instead issue it in his capacity as Prime Minister. The original text of the declaration was finalized by Konoe last night and submitted to the cabinet meeting this morning. The Preparatory Committee held its first meeting yesterday to study the contents of the declaration. The Preparatory Committee will subsequently hold meetings daily or every other day to exchange views sincerely on the construction of a new political system. It is said that the committee will not adopt a majority vote system. In the event of a problem, the chairman has the final decision-making power, and the chairman of the committee will be appointed by Konoe. (27th dispatch)

### Japanese Women's Suffrage League Voluntarily Declares Dissolution

Hong Kong: According to a Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese Women's Suffrage League, which has a history of 15 years, has decided to dissolve voluntarily due to Prime Minister Konoe's new political system movement and will join the Women's Current Affairs Research Association. The Women's Suffrage League was established in 1925 and has 200 members. Currently, the league has reached 2,000 members, including some elderly women with white hair. (27th dispatch)

Japan Suspects US-Australia Joint Defense; Japanese Public Opinion Resentful of US

Tokyo: The "Kokumin Shimbun," which traditionally reflects the views of the Japanese military, predicted today that the United States will establish a joint defense committee with Australia to deter Japan's southward advance. The newspaper stated that many well-informed Japanese sources have expressed apprehension that the United States may prepare for joint defense with Australia, in a form similar to the recently concluded US-Canada defense agreement. The newspaper further stated that Washington is currently secretly negotiating with Britain and the Netherlands to form a communication line from San Francisco via Hawaii to the East Indies and Australia. The newspaper predicted that future US-Japan relations will be "extremely delicate" due to "the recent active change in the United States' Far East policy." The newspaper stated that if the United States continues its "open aggressive steps," Japan will be forced to take "defensive measures." However, the newspaper did not specify the content of Japan's "defensive measures" to counter US pressure in the Far East. Recently, the "Hochi Shimbun" published an article attacking the speech delivered by former Commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, on August 24. In his speech, Admiral Yarnell condemned the aggressive policies of Germany and Japan and implied that the United States might lease the Singapore naval base to facilitate US operations in the Far East. The "Hochi Shimbun" stated that Admiral Yarnell's speech was merely "the tone of US anti-Japanese orators," but continued that the implication of the United States leasing Singapore "cannot be quietly ignored." The newspaper stated that the realization of this scheme would allow the United States to encircle Japan. If the United States obtains a base in Singapore and gains a foothold on the Asian continent, its voice in the Southwest Pacific events will be greatly strengthened, and Japan's planned development regarding the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam will become a bubble.

Dutch East Indies Feels Threatened by Germany and Japan; Intensifies Deployment of Defensive Engineering; and Will Open Aviation School

Batavia: The Dutch East Indies, under the threat of the god of war, currently has two kinds of terror. The local authorities are intensifying preparations to prevent attacks from any side. The greatest terror is that the National Socialist Party of Germany may detain officials and relatives in the Netherlands to demand the return of the Dutch East Indies to German rule. The second terror is that if the United States formally imposes an embargo on Japan, the latter will be forced to advance southward to obtain needed raw materials. The Dutch East Indies is more afraid of Germany, as military preparations and self-defense measures will be useless once Germany takes action. The authorities have not stated how they will respond to any German action, but there is no doubt that this is a difficult problem. The German invasion of the Netherlands is believed to have involved detailed plans for a joint seizure of the Dutch East Indies with Dutch Nazi party members, but this did not materialize due to circumstances. To this day, there are 5,000 members of the Fifth Column in Dutch East Indies concentration camps, 2,000 of whom are German nationals. Arrests of Fifth Column members are still ongoing, but the innocent have been released one after another. The terror of the Fifth Column is no longer very serious. The Dutch people here have never asked their relatives in the Netherlands for news, as this is prohibited by the local authorities to prevent Germany from exploiting this weakness to threaten the East Indies in the future. Strangely, this invisible fear is even greater than the fear of Japanese aggression. Government officials here are currently taking various firm and "successful" economic cooperation measures to appease Japan. The manager of the Economic Department of the Chamber of Commerce here, "Van Gerstalden," recently told a United Press reporter that the Dutch East Indies is very afraid that the United States will declare an embargo on Japan. He said that any US action to embargo Japan, if not backed by force, would encourage Japan to seize the Dutch East Indies to ensure its supply of military raw materials. Van pointed out that the East Indies is actually a fortress for Australia and New Zealand, so the independence of the East Indies is the safety of the two countries. Here, attempts are being made to strengthen economic and political relations with the two countries. Previously, there were rumors that the East Indies would be incorporated into the British Empire for protection, but no formal negotiations have taken place to date. Rumors here are rampant, and the import of firearms has increased sharply. The government does not pay much attention to this, but informed sources reveal that as many as 60 firearms are seized by the authorities every day. It is believed that these are weapons used by foreigners intending to launch a riot here. Dutch officials are currently working hard on defense work, and air-raid shelters are being built everywhere. Taxes have also been increased to meet expenses, and it is said that taxes will continue to increase. An aviation school will be opened here this month to train locals. The Royal Naval Academy has already been opened, and the Army Academy will also be opened at the same time. Dutch officials are deeply concerned that the aircraft and other war materials ordered from the United States cannot be delivered on schedule. (27th United Press dispatch)

US-Japan Relations Extremely Tense; Pacific War Difficult to Avoid; US General Stirling Issues Statement Saying US Military Superiority Can Be Expected to Win

New York: Retired US Fleet Chief of Staff, General Stirling, recently issued a statement acknowledging that a Pacific war is unavoidable. His statement read, "Unless the United States and Japan can peacefully resolve their disputes, the Pacific war, long predicted by military scientists and economists, cannot be avoided. The tension in US-Japan diplomatic relations over the years is the reason why the United States maintains its naval superiority in the Pacific. Since Germany conquered the Low Countries (Netherlands and Belgium) and defeated France, the tension between the United States and Japan has reached a breaking point. The reason for this is that the wealthy Dutch East Indies and French Indochina are coveted by the Japanese. If war breaks out between the United States and Japan, this war should be a naval war, and the battlefield must be in the East. The elements of naval and air warfare are bases, and the United States may not be very advantageous at the beginning of the war with Japan, but it is not absolutely hopeless. Now, let's briefly describe the fleets and bases of the two countries. The United States' active-duty, low-age warships include 15 battleships, 27 cruisers, 5 aircraft carriers, 40 destroyers, and 30 submarines. However, there are many old warships. At present, the main fleet of the United States is in Hawaii, where its first-class naval port, Pearl Harbor, is used. In addition, there is a new base, Dutch Harbor on the island of Alaska in Unalaska, which is currently under construction. Both bases can be used for warships. The air force bases that have been built and are under construction include Midway Island, Wake Island, and Johnston Island in the Hawaiian region, as well as Kodiak Island and Sitka in Alaska. In addition, Canton Island and Pago Pago in the Phoenix region are also suitable for building air force bases. Closely linked to the Hawaiian fleet is the small fleet currently stationed in the Far East, including one cruiser, one squadron of old destroyers, one squadron of submarines, and one aircraft carrier. In wartime, this weak small fleet in the East can be dispatched to the Philippines, where it will deal with the enemy before the arrival of the US fleet, delaying the enemy's occupation of the Philippines. The naval situation in Japan is very secretive. As far as is known, the ratio of US battleships to Japanese battleships is 15 to 9. The United States has a quantitative advantage. As for cruisers, aircraft carriers, modern destroyers, and submarines, the United States may have as many as Japan, even if they are not fewer. The benefit of the Japanese navy, in principle, is that its fleet is concentrated in the place where it believes the war may occur. Therefore, the Japanese have built many secret bases for naval and air warfare in these naval concentration areas. Once war breaks out, the Pacific Ocean is not easy for the United States to deal with. Therefore, US naval personnel must have a full understanding of the various aspects of naval warfare in the Pacific. Although exercises are often held in the Pacific in recent years, these exercises are often defensive in nature, and the scope of the exercises has not exceeded 180 degrees longitude international routes. It must be known that the entire Pacific region can become a battlefield once war breaks out and must be familiar to the US fleet. The final outcome of the US war, judging from the backgrounds of the two countries, victory may belong to the United States. Although Japan is a powerful country with a strong navy and army, it is economically very poor. The United States is a country with abundant resources. Japan may also face resistance from China and the Soviet Union during the war. These situations are enough to cause Japan to lose." (27th United Press dispatch)

Former National Government Advisor Baker Talks About US Embargo Policy; Embargoing Scrap Iron Prompts Japanese Reflection

Former advisor to the Chinese government, Baker, who participated in the US wheat loan from 1931 to 1933, recently commented here on the US embargo policy, saying that it could prompt the end of the Sino-Japanese War. His words were: "Before the outbreak of the European War, the embargo was not effective, because Japan could purchase the military materials it needed from various neutral markets in Europe, but now the United States has become the only market for Japan to purchase military raw materials." Manufacturers and entrepreneurs, fearing that the embargo would harm trade, asked Baker for his opinion. Baker replied, "A certain Japanese official recently told me that the Japanese are deeply grateful that the American people are helping Japan fight against China and that the American people are helping Japan with a selfless attitude, because after Chinese factories, mines, and oil fields are in Japanese hands, the Japanese do not have to be customers of the United States." Zeng said again, "The Japanese search for American scrap iron has caused the price of scrap iron to rise sharply, to the extent that it hinders the US national defense process. Generally speaking, the most effective plan may not be effective immediately, but over time, the difficulty of the Japanese turning around will have an indirect impact on their purchase of military raw materials and promote their reflection."

Italian Prime Minister's Spokesperson Hints at Declaring War on Egypt; British Ships Attacked Bardia Port; Alexandria Attacked by German Planes

Rome: Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaeta, claimed here yesterday that if the Cairo government continues to be subordinate to Britain against Italy's forces in Africa, Italy may be forced to declare war on Egypt. Gaeta said, "In any case, the relationship between Italy and Egypt should be clarified at this critical stage of the current war. Egypt is absolutely clear that Italy has no plans to invade Egypt, but Italy cannot ignore the fact that Britain is using Egyptian territory to attack Italy without causing any visible reaction from Egypt. Britain has built an essential base in Egypt for its offensive in the Mediterranean. It can be said that the existence of the Mediterranean war today is largely due to Britain's base in Egypt."

Philippine President Quezon Says US Will Not Join the War; No Danger of Attack on the Philippines

Manila: President Quezon recently met with reporters and said that he did not believe that the United States would be dragged into any war in Europe or the Far East. At least he did not believe that there was any danger of an attack on the Philippines at present. If the United States were to be involved in the war, the Philippines would naturally fight with the United States. He did not attach importance to the threat of the Fifth Column here. The trade and income of the Philippines are adversely affected by the war, and there may be a famine. He is concerned about this. The reason why he seeks more power to force people to work is to avoid famine in an emergency, not to fear being involved in the war. He can force people to work in wartime, but he wants to be able to exercise this power in peacetime. President Quezon also refuted reports that he advocated a one-party government, saying that he advocated a non-partisan government because this is the only way to preserve democracy. Politicians affiliated with one party always try to promote the claims of their party and are prejudiced against the welfare of the people. (27th Reuters dispatch)

Senior French Concession Police Officer Pulansi Was Sniped at Yesterday; Two Shots Hit, but the Injury Was Not Serious; Pulansi, with Wisdom and Courage, Fought Back

At 8:15 yesterday morning, a shocking assassination occurred on Route Lafayette in the French Concession. The perpetrator used a submachine gun and a Mauser pistol to attack Pulansi (Blanchet), a senior inspector of the French Patrol Room. Fortunately, Pulansi was alert and was only hit by one bullet in the arm, and his waist was grazed by a bullet. The details of the investigation are as follows:

Two Cars Intercepted Together

Pulansi, a Frenchman, is 37 years old. He is currently the acting chief of the French Patrol Room and lives at 1363 Route Lafayette, Leimengto Apartment. At 8:15 yesterday morning, Pulansi, wearing his uniform, was riding in Patrol Room car number 621, intending to go to the Lujiiawan office to work. The car was driven by the driver Du Shuliang. When the car passed near the Huaxun Road of Route Lafayette, near the Tiren Hospital, two cars suddenly came from the east to the west, facing each other.

More Than Twenty Shots Fired

Pulansi and the driver did not pay attention at first. When the two cars approached Pulansi's car, the people in the two cars suddenly took out Mauser pistols and attacked Pulansi. Pulansi was caught off guard and was hit by a bullet in his left arm, and his left waist was grazed by a bullet. It was difficult to use his skills in the car, so he quickly opened the car door and fled to the side of a large tree near the 1325 house number, using it as cover. He crouched down and took out his gun. For a while, bullets flew, and the situation was very tense. The perpetrators realized that the opportunity had failed and could not hold on for long, so they drove away at high speed. During the fight, stray bullets injured a rickshaw puller Zhou Asi (34 years old, from Jiangbei, living at 49 and a half Dapuqiao) in the leg. Later, the patrol room was informed and immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to send Pulansi and Zhou Asi to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

Pulansi's Bullets Have Been Removed

Pulansi's injury is not serious. The bullets in his arm have been removed after surgery. The French patrol room attaches great importance to this case and has ordered all patrol rooms to pay close attention to arrest them. They have also picked up bullet casings at the scene of the incident and taken them back to the patrol room for research, using them as clues to solve the case. According to eyewitnesses who spoke to reporters, there were six or seven perpetrators, divided into two cars, and there seemed to be four wooden shell guns and a submachine gun. When they attacked, they did not get out of the car. When Pulansi fought back, they fled. Pulansi's car was full of bullet holes, and many of the windows were also damaged. Pulansi's driver was fortunate not to be injured.

Pulansi Just Took Office as Acting Chief Yesterday

Pulansi has worked in the patrol room for nearly ten years, is proficient in the Chinese language, and has a Chinese name, Xiao Lindao. He is quite alert, and the patrol room authorities attach great importance to him. In April, he returned to China to participate in military service and obtained the rank of major. He returned to Shanghai immediately. Because his brother-in-law Faber was transferred to Qingdao, as the chief of the French Concession, his position was taken over by Pulansi, who also served as the chief of the Chinese, Western, and Vietnamese patrol officers. It is said that yesterday was the first day of taking office as chief. After the incident, senior patrol room officials and the French consulate went to the hospital to express their condolences. The Western newspapers gave a detailed account of the incident.

Life is Not in Danger Except for Bleeding

The English Da Mei Evening News reported that Lieutenant Pulansi, deputy chief and acting chief of the French Concession Police Department, was ambushed by six Chinese thugs who were lurking on the roadside shortly after leaving his private residence at 1363 Clement Apartment, Route Lafayette this morning (27th). Pulansi fought back and was injured in two places, including his left arm being grazed by a bullet and another bullet piercing his right shoulder. As of 9:00 this morning, one bullet in his shoulder had been removed. Except for bleeding due to injury, his life is not in danger.

Agile Action Escaped Disaster

The car that Pulansi was riding in to the office was shot through by four bullets, because the thugs' assassination attempt fired more than twenty shots. It is also strange that the Chinese policeman who drove the car was not injured despite being in the rain of bullets. French police officers believe that Pulansi was able to save his life because of his agile actions. Seeing the thugs firing, he immediately got out of the car and fought back, which led to it. One of the thugs was also injured.

The Murder Case Has Political Motives

The case this morning is the first time in the history of Shanghai that a senior Western police officer has been sniped at by thugs. Chinese sources believe that this murder case was politically motivated. It is said that recently, some police officers have obtained political subsidies from the Chinese side and are carrying out activities. After Pulansi presided over the investigation of this matter, police officers have been added to guard the area around his residence.

Resisted Even When Injured

At 8:00 this morning, Pulansi, as usual, left Clement Apartment and boarded a car to the headquarters of the French Police Department. Not long after the car drove, a car parked on the side of the road suddenly drove into the center of the road to stop Pulansi's car from moving forward. Six people jumped out of the car, each holding a pistol, and bombarded Pulansi's car. Pulansi hurriedly took out his gun and got out of the car to fight back. The thugs fired wildly when Pulansi got out of the car. Pulansi was shot by a bullet and fell to the ground, but he continued to fight back. Then, he was shot in the right shoulder again, but he still fired his gun and injured one of the thugs.

The Thugs Fled in Panic

Seeing that the matter was exposed, the remaining thugs hurriedly dragged the injured and weapon-abandoning thugs and fled in panic. Pulansi was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital to remove the bullets from his shoulder. By the way, Chief Faber of the French Police Department is currently on vacation, and his duties are handled by Pulansi. Pulansi is 43 years old and has served in the French Police Department for ten years. His wife and child both live in Shanghai. About four months ago, when France was still at war, Pulansi volunteered to join the army and went to Vietnam. He heard that France had signed an armistice, so he returned to Shanghai.

On the Study of Zhongzhou Rhymes by Figures in the Performing Arts Circle and Mr. Yu Zhenfei by Xue Guanlan

A few days ago, a friend came to visit. We happened to talk about Mr. Yu Zhenfei's contribution to a theater newspaper, in which he briefly mentioned that he, Xun Huisheng, and Nan Tiesheng sang "Nengren Temple" together. Xun played the Thirteenth Sister, Nan played Zhang Jinfeng, and Yu played Prince An. When Prince An recited "There are two big holes in front of the chest," the character "窟" (kū, hole) was pronounced as "區越切" (qū yuè qiē, a fanqie spelling). Huisheng found this rather unusual, considering Yu was a student of Cheng Congxian and inherited his teacher's traditions. Moreover, in the play "Beating the Nephew's Grave," the line "There is a big hole here" also has the character "窟" pronounced as "區越切." Mr. Yu is very interested in the pronunciation of characters and enjoys it immensely. If anyone is willing to engage in meticulous textual criticism, he would consider them a kindred spirit.

According to my humble opinion, the character "間" (jiān, between) has a wide sound, belonging to the 曷跋 (hé bá) rhyme, and is an entering tone in the yin category. It is pronounced as "哭兀切" (kū wù qiē). In the four vocalizations, it is a rounded-lip sound, and in terms of weight, it is a voiced sound. For example, the "窟" (kū, hole) in "狡兔三窟" (jiǎo tù sān kū, a cunning rabbit has three burrows) and "窟籠" (kū lóng, pit, hole) must be read with this sound, as is the case in classical texts. The "Book of Rites" states: "In winter, they live in caves (營窟)." Here, "窟" is read as "枯忽切" (kū hū qiē). Also, in the "Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government, Tang Xuanzong," Geshu Han said to An Lushan: "The ancients said, 'A fox howling at its den (窟) is inauspicious, forgetting its origin.'" Hu Sanxing's commentary states that "窟" is read as "苦曷切" (kǔ hé qiē). Furthermore, the "籠" (lóng, cage) in "窟籠" (kū lóng, pit, hole) is different from the "窿" (lóng, hole) in "孔窿" (kǒng lóng, hole, opening). The combined sound of the two is "空" (kōng, empty), but it is also acceptable to write "窟窿" (kū lóng, pit, hole).

Huisheng's assertion that the character "窟" should be read as "苦" (kǔ, bitter) is also not entirely correct. In my humble opinion, among the sounds in phonology, entering tones are the most difficult. This is because Northern opera does not have entering tones, which are merged into the three tones of level, rising, and departing. However, in Zhongzhou Rhymes, for the singing and recitation in Peking opera, the distinction of entering tones must be absolutely clear, especially the difference between yin entering and yang entering. In Huangqiang opera, there are cases where Northern pronunciations are adopted due to established conventions.

The study of phonology is as profound as the vast sea, and scholars have long regarded it as a daunting task. However, those who are good at composing tunes must distinguish the nine tones and repeatedly contemplate them. The nine tones are yin level, yang level, yin departing, yang departing, yin entering, yang entering, yin rising, yang rising, and the rising tone that is common to both yin and yang. Only the rising tone has characters that are common to both yin and yang, such as the characters "馬" (mǎ, horse) and "兩" (liǎng, two). Today's famous actors only distinguish between yin and yang level and the five tones of rising, departing, and entering, which is certainly insufficient. It is abundantly clear that, in addition to the nine tones, one must also distinguish between the methods of open, closed, rounded, and contracted mouth positions, as well as the difference between clear, voiced, and semi-voiced sounds. These distinctions are often subtle, yet crucial. The study of phonology is truly like this; it is precisely because it is so difficult that Zhongzhou Rhymes are a precious treasure of our national culture. In recent times, only Tan (Xinpei) and Yu (Shuyan) have dedicated themselves to this field. Their unwavering dedication has allowed them to excel and shine both in their time and in posterity. I have always believed that if the Tan school does not decline, Peking opera will not perish, and if the study of phonology does not cease, the vitality of Peking opera will endure. This is the reason why. However, today, few people pay attention to the study of phonology, and the art of Tan and Yu is on the verge of extinction, which is truly lamentable.

Mr. Yu said that the study of phonology is essential, but too much research can also lead to errors. This statement may seem unbelievable, but it is based on experience. Let me give an example to illustrate this. Since Yu Shuyan retired to his home, he has been diligently studying character pronunciation, just like old Tan in his later years. His recent recordings show that his artistry has become even purer, and his articulation and vocal delivery demonstrate his skill. In the "Sand River and Money Farewell" excerpt, the line "金鑾殿王與你改換法袍" (Jīn luán diàn wáng yǔ nǐ gǎi huàn fǎ páo, In the Golden Palace, the king will change your robes) is incredibly sharp and crisp. In the "Campaign Against Wu" excerpt, the last three characters of the line "黃漢升撩袍御營進" (Huáng Hànshēng liáo páo yù yíng jìn, Huang Hansheng lifts his robe and enters the imperial camp) are perfectly steady and appropriate. However, the character "撩" (liáo, lift) is pronounced as "里杳切" (lǐ yǎo qiē), resulting in a yin rising tone, which is actually incorrect. The reason for this is that he studied too much. According to phonology, the character "撩" (liáo, lift) should be pronounced as "離毫切" (lí háo qiē), a yang level tone, belonging to the 蕭豪 (xiāo háo) rhyme, or as "立耀切" (lì yào qiē), a yang departing tone. Yang departing tones often correspond to yang rising tones. However, if we look at the characters with the "尞" (liáo) radical, such as "燎" (liǎo/liáo, burn), "繚" (liǎo/liáo, wind around), and "獠" (liáo, barbarian), they all encompass yang level, yang rising, and yang departing tones. Therefore, Shuyan's pronunciation of yin rising is not to be followed. I have retired from worldly affairs and presumptuously study phonology, intending to write a book dedicated to vocal sounds and rhymes. This will hopefully be beneficial to opera. In the book, I will categorize commonly used characters into the nine tones, and strive for accuracy in the fanqie spelling. I will also include interesting but rarely seen characters. However, I fear that the scope is too broad and my talent is insufficient, much like King Wu of Qin's fear of lifting the Ding cauldron.

"The Gay Bandit" Review by Jun Tao

Under the call for remakes of old Hollywood films, many old films have been remade and released. For example, "Affectionately Yours" and "The Gay Bandit," which is currently showing in Nanjing, are examples of this. Although they are both remakes of old films and have undergone the latest technology of the 1940s, some have been successful, while others have not achieved satisfactory results. "Affectionately Yours" is a very successful remake, but "The Gay Bandit" has not been as successful due to errors in the director's technique.

The male lead, David Niven, is a comedy veteran whose comedic talent has been unanimously praised by the press. The female lead, Olivia de Havilland, does not have any special achievements in comedy. Her performance with Dick Powell in "Hard to Get" was also mediocre, and it is a pity that she could not display her talent in this film due to the plot. The director, Sam Wood, is the director of the 1939 top ten film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips." His technique is strong in clarity and depth. Originally, comedic films emphasize lightheartedness and humor, with wonderful interjections. However, Sam Wood still used his inherent style in this film, causing the film to rely on dialogue and become dull. Half of the reason why this film cannot become a wonderful comedy must be attributed to the director's technique.

However, the director's technique is admirable. For example, the introduction of the so-called "Gay Bandit" at the beginning uses a drawing teacher telling students that this is a valuable work of art, and in an instant, the painting is gone. It also uses the scene of a jewelry store theft to show the thief's quick methods. Then, the so-called "Gay Bandit" appears on the screen! Also, the scene of stealing the Duchess's necklace and the final arrest of the thief are quite suspenseful. However, because of the lack of wonderful interjections, it makes the film a comedy in name but with the flavor of a detective film.

The successful actors are David Niven, who plays the Gay Bandit, and Thaddeus Larrabee, who plays Inspector McCracken. The three short films before the main feature - "Popular Science," "Jerusalem," and "Unusual Occupations" - are worth watching. Among them, "Jerusalem" is a short film about the various historical sites in the Christian holy city of Jerusalem and the ancient architecture of 2,000 years ago, which is quite commendable.
