Editorial

### A General Overview of the Recent Sino-Japanese War Situation

The center of gravity of the Sino-Japanese war situation has shifted to the South China region since the Xiangbei campaign in September and October of last year. Although the Chinese army launched a full-scale offensive on all fronts in the north and south in December and achieved significant results, the elite Japanese troops were constantly transferred from the Northeast and Central China to gather in Guangdong and Guangxi to reinforce the isolated troops besieged in Yongning and its periphery. In late December, they launched the so-called "Christmas Offensive" in northern Guangdong with 80,000 elite troops. The scale of this offensive, the speed of its progress, and the intensity of the fighting were all astonishing. However, after the Chinese army's "New Year's Day Counteroffensive," within a few days, the Japanese army retreated 200 li, its elite troops were annihilated, and its supplies were completely lost, forming a clear contrast with its offensive. This major victory after the Xiangbei campaign happened to occur on the first day of the 29th year of the Republic of China, which not only further invigorated the anti-Japanese construction spirit being promoted, but also symbolized the rise and fall of the national strength and military power of both China and Japan thereafter.

From the perspective of the overall Sino-Japanese war, the local advances and retreats of the Japanese army on the South China battlefield cannot have a major decisive effect; at most, they can only threaten the interests of third countries and contain the military strength of the Chinese army, and take advantage of the Chinese army's concentration in Central China to win a few battles in South China to stimulate their exhausted military morale and popular sentiment. Even if they are lucky enough to win, it is only avoiding the substantial and taking the virtual, taking risks and hoping for luck; if they suffer defeat, it will only prove that their troops are old and tired, and they are frequently exhausted. Therefore, the Japanese warlords' shift to an offensive in the southern battlefield is clearly a last resort in a state of exhaustion.

In the recent battles in South China, although the Japanese side has used elite troops, the deployment and configuration are not precise, and they are only making a desperate effort, hoping for a fluke. Last year, in the Qin, Fang, Yongning campaign, because the defending army was slightly weaker and the traitors were rampant, the Japanese army was fortunate enough to make progress, which further stimulated the greed of the Japanese warlords in South China, and they continued to launch a fierce attack in northern Guangdong. However, they did not know that even in the Qin and Yong areas, the Japanese army was suffering from congenital defects in strategy, so that for more than a month, despite repeated reinforcements, they are still fighting hard in a narrow passage and cannot achieve their goals. Moreover, the terrain in northern Guangdong is easy to defend and difficult to attack, and the Chinese army has a long and substantial preparation. Therefore, the Japanese army's underestimation of the enemy and impetuous advance naturally led to a disastrous defeat. To compare it with the experience of the Xiangbei campaign: the terrain of Changsha is easy to attack but difficult to defend, which is the opposite of northern Guangdong, and the Dongting waterway provides great convenience for the Japanese army to advance. The Japanese side's strategic deployment was also quite detailed. If the Japanese army advancing westward from northern Jiangxi had not been strongly resisted east of the Jiuling Mountains, the Chinese army's mobile tactics would have been greatly constrained, and the counterattack effect would have been difficult to predict. The Japanese warlords had already learned that lesson, but this time, in northern Guangdong, where the terrain and transportation were both inconvenient, they made even looser deployments and even more impetuous advances. Their foolishness is truly beyond reach. At the same time, it also shows their eagerness to take risks and hope for luck.

All these situations cannot be entirely attributed to the lack or decline of Japanese generals. Given the current situation of the Japanese, even if there were outstanding military geniuses as commanders, it would be difficult to handle the situation with ease and achieve significant results. General Nogi Maresuke in the Russo-Japanese War, his most successful strategy was to sacrifice a large number of soldiers to win victory; this can be criticized in essence. But fortunately, at that time, Japan's Meiji Restoration was on the rise, the morale of the people was vigorous, the morale of the army was high, and the mobilization of troops was far from the saturation point, so it allowed to disregard everything and only aim for a victory; moreover, success or failure is judged by results, so there is nothing to criticize. But how can this strategy be used today, when more than two million people have been mobilized, the front line has been extended for four thousand miles, the people are poor internally, and the troops are old externally!

In the first phase of this Sino-Japanese war, the Japanese warlords were determined to invade and extended the front line to an unprecedented length in history, but the troops could not be increased in proportion, so that the troops at each point and on each line were increasingly dispersed and weakened. This process is still developing with the Japanese warlords' blind collisions everywhere. In recent years, the Chinese side has been working hard to manage the rear military deployments in the occupied areas, which has made it even more difficult for the Japanese army to take care of both ends. A year ago, the Xuzhou and Wuhan campaigns organized by the Japanese side were all about gathering hundreds of thousands of troops to engage in the capture of a major battlefield. After Wuhan and Guangzhou were lost, the Japanese warlords could only make feints to the east and west, seize opportunities to take advantage of loopholes, and use the sea and land transportation under their control to transfer troops back and forth to cope with the situation, and could no longer launch large-scale offensives on all battlefields at the same time. In the past year, the battles in western Shanxi, southern Shanxi, northern Jiangxi, central Hubei, northern Hunan, southern Guangxi, and northern Guangdong have all been like this. Although some of them, such as Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong, suffered disastrous defeats, and some, such as Nanchang and Yongren, were lucky enough to achieve success, this has formed a fatal wound in the Japanese army's war of aggression against China. The victory of the Chinese army's offensives on all fronts in December of last year, although it failed to prevent the Japanese army from reinforcing Lingnan, has proved the general weakness of the Japanese army's strength on all fronts. According to the latest statistics released by the Military Affairs Commission: from the beginning of the war to the present, the Japanese army has suffered more than 1.4 million casualties, with an average monthly casualty rate of about 50,000; now, the Japanese side has no sufficient reserve army or young men to be transferred; therefore, under the continuous massive consumption of the War of Resistance, the strength of the Japanese army will inevitably become increasingly depleted, and at the same time, the difficulties in military mobilization and deployment will also increase. The opportunity for the Chinese army's full-scale counteroffensive is not yet ripe at present, but the various facts at present have indicated the direction that the anti-Japanese military should strive for in the future.

Within the Japanese warlords themselves, they have indeed learned from the war process the difficulty of conquering China by force, and have even publicly admitted it. Therefore, for more than a year, they have been making every effort to launch political and diplomatic offensives to alleviate their military difficulties. The more unfavorable the war of aggression against China becomes, the more intensified these offensives will be. But people should understand that the final outcome of the Sino-Japanese problem still depends only on the success or failure of the military, and the many important victories in recent years have made this understanding and confidence increasingly strong.

### Hull Meets with Japanese Ambassador to Discuss US-Japan Trade Relations; Neither Side Presents Any Concrete Plans; Nomura and Grew Will Hold Negotiations in Tokyo

Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horita met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday to resume the previously held US-Japan trade negotiations. After the meeting, Ambassador Horita stated that he and Hull discussed relations between the two countries, but he did not present any plans to improve relations between the two countries, nor did he receive any plans. Horita continued, stating that he hopes that after the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce on January 26, the business relations between the two countries will continue to proceed smoothly. However, when answering reporters' questions, he could not provide what the starting point he hoped for would be. According to reporters' investigations, US Ambassador to Japan Grew will hold several more talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Kichisaburo, but the date of the negotiations has not been announced. Well-informed sources deeply believe that unless Japan takes the initiative first, there will be no other decisive developments in US-Japan relations before the expiration of the US-Japan Treaty. (Seventh dispatch from United Press)

Tokyo: This newspaper published a large-character headline stating that Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Kichisaburo intends to invite US Ambassador to Japan Grew to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this week to urge the official start of US-Japan trade negotiations. The Japanese side's purpose is to conclude transitional measures to replace the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, which expires on January 26. Although the date of the Nomura-Grew meeting has not been set, the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" believes that the two sides intend to meet on Tuesday. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" also believes that Nomura will explain to Ambassador Grew the plan to establish a new "central government" led by Wang Jingwei, and guarantee that the plan will not harm American rights in China. Nomura will also discuss with Grew the practical issue of opening the Yangtze River in detail. (Seventh dispatch from United Press)

### US-Japan Treaty of Commerce Is Not Likely To Be Re-negotiated, Bishop Ward's Observation

Chongqing: American Bishop Ward of the West China Methodist Church, who recently returned here from the United States, stated yesterday at a banquet held by foreign women in Chongqing that the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce of 1911 will not be re-negotiated after it expires this month. He said that the American people feel more deeply about China's struggle for justice. The United States announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce for major and international reasons. If those reasons still exist, if respect for international treaties still cannot be better guaranteed, I can assert that the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce will not be re-negotiated. (Seventh dispatch from United Press)

### The United States Plans to Expand the Strength of the Atlantic Fleet, Retiring Fleet Commander Black Says the US Navy Is Prepared to Deal with War

Washington: According to a senior member of the Naval Committee who told United Press reporters yesterday, "He will launch a movement in the United States to build an Atlantic Fleet worth 200 million US dollars, because the world situation is becoming increasingly serious and the United States needs to defend the Latin American republics. The current Pacific Fleet has a strength of 200 million tons, and the Atlantic Fleet should have at least two-thirds of the strength of the Pacific Fleet. After this plan is implemented, the United States will spend 400 million US dollars in funding each year, but this kind of expenditure is extremely worthwhile." (Seventh dispatch from United Press)

San Pedro: US Fleet Commander Admiral Black has retired. Yesterday, Commander Black handed over his position to the new Commander Richardson. According to Black, who told reporters, the US Navy is now prepared for war, and said that as a result of the US Navy personnel burying themselves in hard work in the past six months, they are indeed able to cope with war. In the current chaotic world situation, the United States should maintain and enhance its naval strength in order to cope with all emergencies. (Seventh dispatch from United Press)

Washington: It was announced here last night that President Roosevelt has requested Congress to allocate funds to build small boats for installing anti-submarine nets. This request is included in the Naval Department's repair bureau's engineering fee of 28,177,000 yuan, with each boat costing between 3,000,000 yuan and 8,000,000 yuan. (Seventh dispatch from United Press)

### Philippines Fortress Defense, Senior Commissioner Sayre To Inspect Within Days

Manila: US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre is scheduled to go to Corregidor Fortress in Manila Bay on Tuesday to inspect defenses. Corregidor is the most complete fortress of the United States in the Far East, and is sufficient to resist a strong enemy for six months before the arrival of the main force of the US Navy. Also, Sayre has held secret talks with Cameron, the secretary of the US Consul General in Tokyo, for the past two days. Also, the current reserve force of the Philippines army is 120,000 people, all of whom have undergone five and a half months of training. The weapons include machine guns, field artillery, aircraft (including training and fighter aircraft), 45 aircraft, and two high-speed mosquito boats. The military training plan for the Philippines was drawn up by US military advisor General MacArthur. The method is to spend 8,000,000 US dollars per year, so that by 1946, a reserve force of 360,000 and a regular army of 200,000 can be trained. (Seventh dispatch from United Press)

### US-Argentina Trade Agreement Negotiations Have No Hope of Reopening

Washington: The breakdown of the negotiations on the trade agreement between the United States and Argentina has recently been commented on by diplomatic circles here. They generally said that the establishment of a trade agreement between the United States and Uruguay has also been blocked because the types of export goods of Uruguay and Argentina are roughly the same, and the United States and Uruguay can only negotiate the same terms after the trade agreement between the United States and Argentina is announced. Officials responsible for this in the United States said that the negotiations between the United States and Argentina are impossible to reopen. The main reason is not the details but the difference in general policies. It is heard that the United States government has made many concessions in tariffs when negotiating trade agreements with other countries in the past. The same concessions were also offered in this negotiation with Argentina, but the current trade policy of the United States, although aimed at developing international business, must also be within the scope of not harming its own agriculture and industry. In Argentina, they asked the United States to make concessions on the import tax rate of certain agricultural products, which is not in line with the interests of American farmers. Therefore, the positions of the United States and Argentina are almost impossible to reconcile, and there may not be any hope of reopening negotiations in the future. However, the trade negotiations between the United States and Chile are progressing very smoothly. (Sixth dispatch from Havas)

### The Japanese Opposition Party's Momentum Is Growing, and the Abe Cabinet's Fate Is in Jeopardy; Navy Minister Yoshida Discusses with Abe, and a Statement on the China Issue Will Be Issued

Tokyo: Political figures here generally believe that the fate of the Abe Cabinet must be decided in the middle of this month. It is said that Navy Minister Yoshida visited Prime Minister Abe yesterday to discuss the status of the current government and the increasingly strong opposition forces. The Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun" declared that this matter has attracted great attention from political figures in Tokyo, because he has always remained silent on the various mistakes of the "Abe Cabinet." (Seventh dispatch from Haitong)

Tokyo: Today's Yomiuri Shimbun reported that after Prime Minister Abe presents a memorial to the Emperor tomorrow, the government will issue a public statement in the near future to clarify its attitude towards resolving the China Incident. This statement will solemnly declare that Japan's goal in the current situation is to establish a new order in East Asia based on the principles of neighborliness, joint national defense, and joint economic system based on Sino-Japanese equality. Regarding this matter, the Japanese government recognizes that the proposed new government under the leadership of Wang Jingwei is the first step towards building a new China, as declared in Konoe's statement of December 22, 1938, and will therefore assist this new government. This statement will continue to explain that the mere establishment of a new government does not mean the resolution of the war with China. A constructive war will require a longer period of time, so we urge the Japanese people to maintain a strong determination to cope with this situation. (Seventh dispatch from Reuters)

### The Incident of Japanese Soldiers Being Shot Has Been Resolved

Beiping: The incident in which a Japanese soldier was shot and injured by an American soldier on the evening of the 4th has now been completely and peacefully resolved. It is said that the actions of the American sentry were merely performing their duties. The injured Japanese soldier was shot by an American sentry for crossing the wall of the American embassy. The Japanese soldier is now in a Japanese hospital and is expected to be discharged today. According to reliable sources, the Japanese soldier came from Fengtai and crossed the wall of the American embassy while drunk. At that time, he was discovered by two American sentries, who ordered the Japanese soldier to stop to no avail, so they fired four shots and injured the Japanese soldier. Regarding this incident, the Japanese Allied Society published distorted news, attributing the fault to the American side. (Seventh dispatch from United Press)

Beiping: The conflict between Japanese soldiers and American sailors is expected to be resolved soon. Both sides believe that the matter is not serious. Judging from the situation at the time, the fault lay with the Japanese soldier, and the American soldier was justified in firing the shot. The Japanese soldier only suffered minor injuries. The bullet glanced off his chest, and the injuries were not serious. The Japanese side's claim that the Japanese soldier was seriously injured is inaccurate. It seems to have been determined that the Japanese soldier was drunk at the time. However, the official statement on this matter has not yet been released here. The Japanese soldier, wearing a military uniform, rushed into the American embassy guard camp on Thursday night and refused to listen to the American soldiers' warnings, which led to the shooting. (Seventh dispatch from Reuters)

### Beiping Intensifies Anti-British Movement

### Japanese Side Admits Burning of British Church Property

Qingdao: Reuters obtained news today that the Japanese authorities in Qingdao admitted that the Japanese army burned down the property of the British Methodist Church outside Wudingfu, Shandong Province, on December 25, but refused to release the number of the Japanese army or guarantee that the same situation would not happen again in the future. It is said that the church side discriminated against the Japanese army. At present, there is no representative of the Methodist Church in Qingdao, so the extent or nature of the destruction is unknown. However, it is heard that the most destroyed was the hospital set up by the church, because the Japanese army pointed out that it had accommodated guerrillas. (Seventh dispatch from Reuters)

### Conclusion of Italian-Hungarian Talks: Agreement on European Situation, Foreign Ministers Depart Venice Separately, Italy May Mediate Romanian-Hungarian Dispute

Venice, Italy. Foreign Minister Ciano concluded his third meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky here this morning after an hour. A communiqué was subsequently issued stating, "The Italian and Hungarian Foreign Ministers have exchanged views on the general European situation. The foundation of friendship and close cooperation between the two countries is very strong, and the two governments are pleased to find their views are consistent." Foreign Minister Ciano also told the press afterward that Italy and Hungary hold the same political and spiritual views on European issues. Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to return to Rome today, while Foreign Minister Csáky is expected to return to his country tomorrow. (Seventh Day Havas Telegraph)

Bern, Switzerland. After the Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky and the Italian Foreign Minister Ciano held talks in Venice today, political figures here stated that the focus of their discussions was likely the relationship between Hungary and Romania. They expressed hope that Italy could mediate to achieve a resolution on terms favorable to both parties. The Basler Nachrichten recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Budapest stating that Italy has proposed mediation to the Romanian government more than once. Now, it is expressing its determination to oppose the expansion of Soviet influence in the Danube region and is willing to mediate between Romania and Hungary. Therefore, diplomatic circles in Budapest generally hope that Foreign Minister Ciano can advise Foreign Minister Csáky to negotiate a provisional agreement with Romania to resolve all outstanding issues. (Sixth Day Havas Telegraph)

Venice. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano held a second meeting with the Hungarian Foreign Minister yesterday. The two sides discussed matters for an hour and a half. The results of the meeting will be announced in a communiqué. After the communiqué is released, Ciano will fly back to Rome. (Seventh Day United Press Telegraph)

Venice. Foreign Minister Ciano arrived here this morning and immediately began talks with Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky. They then had lunch together, followed by further talks lasting seventy-five minutes. According to Foreign Minister Ciano afterward, the talks were extremely cordial and demonstrated that the two governments hold the same views on all issues. It is reported that the two men are scheduled to continue their talks tomorrow morning. Tonight, Foreign Minister Ciano will host a dinner to welcome Csáky. (Sixth Day Havas Telegraph)

Rome. The talks between Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky in Venice are being commented on by diplomatic circles here. It is generally believed that Italy and Hungary may conclude a military alliance treaty to defend against the Soviet Union. Since the expansion of Soviet influence to the Carpathian Mountains, the countries of Southeastern Europe have felt threatened. Among them, Hungary is deeply concerned about political pressure from the Soviet Union and knows that Germany is also controlled by the Soviet Union. These countries may collude with each other, placing the countries of Southeastern Europe in the same situation as the countries along the Baltic Sea sooner or later. Therefore, they have to turn to Italy, hoping that the country will agree to provide assistance under any circumstances to cope with the crisis posed by the Soviet Union. Italy shares this sentiment, making it easy to approach Hungary. It is also known from informed sources that the ministers of Italy and Hungary will soon be promoted to ambassadors, which will be a clear indication of the friendship between the two nations. (Seventh Day Havas Agency Telegraph)

Budapest. Newspapers here are commenting on Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky's visit to Italy, believing that Italian-Hungarian friendship is a stabilizing factor for the political situation in Central Europe. The friendly and understanding attitude of Germany and its allies toward Hungary is clear evidence that Hungarian foreign policy has adopted the correct path. Friendly countries should regularly review common issues, so Csáky's visit to Italy is unlikely to have surprising results, but major political issues in Europe should be discussed. (Sixth Day Haitong Telegraph)

The Hague. The visit of Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky to Italy has attracted the attention of German political circles. The Essener National-Zeitung (the organ of German Aviation Minister General Göring) recently commented, stating that the diplomatic activities of the countries of Southeastern Europe have now resumed. Most of the countries engaged in these activities harbor extravagant desires, and those countries with a direct interest in the various issues of Southeastern Europe are noteworthy. (Seventh Day Havas Telegraph)

### Italy Strives to Maintain Peace in Southeastern Europe, Starting with Resolving Outstanding Issues Between Countries, Preventing Soviet Influence from Entering the Balkans

Rome. Mussolini's mouthpiece, Guido, recently published an article in the semi-official Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, commenting on the talks between the Italian and Hungarian Foreign Ministers in Venice. It stated that the situation in the Danube region and the Balkan Peninsula will become clearer as a result. Although no agreement may be reached, the nature of the issues discussed in these talks suggests that they are by no means ordinary. In general, Foreign Minister Ciano will consult with Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky on the following matters: (1) the current war and its possible impact on Italy and Hungary; (2) the attitude of Southeastern European countries toward the current war; (3) the mutual relations of Southeastern European countries; (4) the external expansion of the Soviet Union and the threats it poses. As far as Italy is concerned, its current policy has been clearly stated in the communiqué issued by the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party on December 7th of last year, and in Foreign Minister Ciano's subsequent speech to the Fascist Trade Union Parliament. In essence, Italy will not participate in the current war, which is different from neutrality. This is the first point. Italy, as a major power in the Mediterranean region, is eager to maintain the territorial integrity and sovereign independence of the countries of Southeastern Europe. Therefore, it wants to maintain peace among these countries and find solutions to all outstanding issues between them, so that they can resolve their differences, speak well of each other, and cooperate closely. This is the second point. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Ciano has said that Italy has no intention of promoting the formation of a bloc of Balkan countries. Italy's intention is to maintain freedom of action. At this time, the various outstanding issues of these countries have not been resolved, and organizing a bloc would inevitably be premature. Until recently, Hungary and Yugoslavia have been approaching each other, and the relations between Romania and Hungary have also improved, which is gratifying. It is hoped that the governments of these countries can adopt more moderate and self-restrained policies to resolve the current outstanding issues. With regard to Hungary and Romania in particular, both are under the threat of a communist crisis, so they should work together harmoniously to protect themselves. In short, Italy has no intention of aggression against the Soviet Union, but it will not allow communism to expand its influence in Europe. For the Soviet Union's sake, it should remain quiet within its current borders. If it does, Italy will not oppose it. (Sixth Day Havas Telegraph)

Paris. Regarding the talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky in Venice, informed sources here stated that Southeastern Europe has been threatened by the Soviet Union. Italy and Hungary, in view of this, are eager to formulate a common policy to cope with the situation. The mutual relations between the Balkan Peninsula countries, as well as the relations between Italy and Hungary and Germany, and the impact of the current war on Italy and Hungary, can then be resolved. Italy's warnings to the Soviet Union have been going on for a long time, and their meaning is very clear. In other words, although Italy does not want to provoke the Soviet Union, if the Soviet Union develops its influence in the Balkan Peninsula, Italy cannot turn a blind eye. As Foreign Minister Ciano stated today, Italy and Hungary share the desire to maintain peace and order in Europe. Since Italy annexed Albania, it has regarded itself as a major power in the Balkan Peninsula and does not want the countries of the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube region to fight each other, which could be exploited by other countries. Diplomatic circles also say that Italy wants the Balkan Peninsula countries to resolve their differences and speak well of each other. This is not intended to organize a Balkan neutral bloc (based on past experience, this plan is unlikely to be realized), nor is Italy planning to form a consultative group with Yugoslavia and Hungary in politics. In fact, the aim is to avoid conflicts between Romania and Hungary, where Bessarabia is coveted by the Soviet Union, Dobruja is demanded by Bulgaria, and Transylvania is demanded by Hungary. The confrontation between Romania and Hungary is particularly acute, so it is urgent to avoid conflict. (Sixth Day Havas Telegraph)

Finnish Report: Advancing on Two Routes

Stockholm, Sweden. According to a Finnish report, the Soviet 163rd Division has not been reorganized and has been unable to concentrate its forces for a counterattack. However, on the 5th of this month, small Soviet units gathered their strength to resist the Finnish army's advance, but surrendered within a few hours. In the Suomussalmi section, the Finnish army advanced on two routes, one attacking towards Jääski and the other pressing towards Jyndystränta. The Soviet army in that area is retreating.

### Soviet Submarine Fires on Swedish Ship

Stockholm, Sweden. The Swedish ship "Sunris" was shelled by a Soviet submarine in the Gulf of Bothnia yesterday and immediately caught fire. The morning newspapers here commented on this with indignation, saying that the ship was hit by about 100 shells. The fact that all crew members were able to escape safely was due to the poor quality of Soviet ammunition. Dagens Nyheter also reported that the "Sunris" was sailing 20 miles off the coast of Finland and could not be considered to be breaking through the Soviet naval blockade. Moreover, since the Soviet Union has not declared war on Finland, it has no right to implement a blockade at all. Furthermore, the cargo carried by the "Sunris" was being transported from a Swedish port to another port in Sweden. In any case, the Soviet navy had no reason to attack it.

### The Story of How the British Female Spy Mitford Was Killed in Germany

Paris. The London "Daily Mail" recently published an article titled "Himmler Ordered the Shooting of Mitford," stating that on September 3 last year, the day Britain declared war on Germany, the head of the German political police, Himmler, suspected Ms. Mitford of engaging in espionage activities for Britain and ordered SS leader Scharenberg to shoot her. Scharenberg learned that Ms. Mitford went to Munich Park for a walk every day, so he ambushed her near the park. When she arrived there, he fired two shots at her. However, due to the distance, although she was hit, it was not fatal. Himmler had suspected Ms. Mitford's actions as early as the spring of last year, not only fearing that she was a British spy, but also that she had an influence on the Führer. However, Hitler himself remained indifferent. In addition, Ms. Mitford had returned to Britain once last year and made great efforts to promote Hitler. As for her personal relationship with Führer Hitler, it was not well understood by outsiders due to the strict censorship of the Nazi propaganda apparatus. Until September 1 of last year, after Britain declared war on Germany, Himmler believed that it was not in Germany's interest for Ms. Mitford to remain in the country, so he ordered Scharenberg to put her to death. The above is the story of how Ms. Mitford was injured. Rumors that Ms. Mitford had committed suicide were not true. Later, the German authorities allowed Ms. Mitford to return to her country for treatment, but told her not to disclose German political affairs to the outside world, otherwise retaliatory measures would be taken.

### Red Army Newspaper Attacks Britain and France; Swedish Foreign Minister Denies Receiving Proposals with British and French Guarantees

Moscow - The Red Army newspaper "Red Star," under the title "Inside Story of Aiding Finland," recently published an article attacking Britain and France. It stated briefly that the pressure exerted by Britain and France on the Scandinavian countries should be closely watched. Ostensibly, these countries are aiding Finland, but in reality, they are trying to win over the Scandinavian countries to join the British and French imperialist bloc in order to wage war against Germany. This attempt has provoked a reaction from Germany. In short, the true intention of Britain and France in vigorously propagating aid to "Mannerheim's Finland" is to make the Scandinavian countries their pawns. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

London - The text published by the Soviet "Red Star" has been commented upon by diplomatic circles here, saying that it is a first step to encourage Germany to take swift action in concert with the Soviet Union against the Scandinavian countries. At this juncture, the Soviet foreign authorities strenuously argue that Britain and France, under the guise of aiding Finland, actually intend to entice the Scandinavian countries to first fight the Soviet Union and then fight Germany. All of this suggests that due to insufficient military strength, they want to induce Germany to provide assistance. It is understood that the Soviet Union originally sought to expand its influence in the Baltic coastal countries and the Scandinavian countries after obtaining German consent. Now, due to insufficient strength, it is forced to openly beg Germany for aid, which is rather disgusting. However, the British and French governments firmly believe that Finland is the outpost of all European democracies resisting the threat of communism. Therefore, they have already decided to provide as much assistance as possible to that country in accordance with the resolutions passed by the League of Nations, and they hope that the Scandinavian countries can also do their best. If these countries are threatened as a result, Britain and France will not stand idly by, it can be asserted. In short, all the possible problems that this matter may cause, including the possibility of Germany and the Soviet Union invading the Scandinavian countries, have been carefully considered by Britain and France. For the time being, however, the actions of Britain and France are limited to assisting Finland in accordance with the resolutions of the League of Nations and the principle of neutrality. If Germany and the Soviet Union do not threaten the Scandinavian countries, Britain and France will not take any action in that regard either. Such is the attitude of Britain and France. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Stockholm, Sweden - Swedish Foreign Minister Günther declared to a Reuters reporter this afternoon that the Swedish government has not yet received proposals from Britain or France regarding guarantee and mutual assistance treaties. Political figures here are very interested in this statement. They point out that news from the Netherlands claims that Britain and France have made proposals to Sweden for a guarantee treaty, not through the usual diplomatic channels, but through other channels to the Swedish authorities. Therefore, although the Swedish government is unaware of this proposal, as stated by the Swedish Foreign Minister, it is not impossible that non-official persons have indirectly made this proposal.

### New British Cabinet Lineup Fails to Fully Satisfy; Public Opinion Mostly Disapproves of Sir Reith; The Times Says Structure Still Needs Adjustment

London - After Secretary of War Hore-Belisha resigns, he is scheduled to go to Buckingham Palace on the ninth of this month to meet King George VI and surrender the seal of the War Office. Regarding the appointment of President of the Board of Trade Stanley as the successor to Secretary of War, it is generally said that the intention is to allow the army generals to fully exert their abilities. As for the vacancy left by the President of the Board of Trade, it will be filled by Sir Duncan, a director of the Bank of England and a major industrialist. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life expressed satisfaction, because this man is not only capable in his work, but also has a thorough understanding of various issues related to industry. In addition, the general public mostly disapproves of the appointment of British Broadcasting Corporation Director-General Sir Reith as Minister of Information.

Amsterdam - The London "Times" published an editorial today commenting on the recent reorganization of the British government, believing that the problem of the entire government structure has not been resolved.

Regarding this point, the newspaper argued that the Prime Minister should make decisions independently and decisively, and should not be reluctant to let go of one or two cabinet members or be concerned about anything else. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

London - Lord Milner recently published an article in the Sunday Dispatch commenting on the resignation of Secretary of War Hore-Belisha. He said, "This matter will not affect Britain's determination to fight. I once gave a speech in the House of Lords, stating briefly, 'Our cooperation with France is very satisfactory. The most difficult issue of Allied command has also been resolved satisfactorily. At this moment, the French side is in charge of military affairs by two veterans of the last European war, one being Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin, and the other being Army Chief of Staff General Georges, both of whom I am very close to. They will definitely work together with our frontline generals and our country's War Office. The Germans must pay attention to the fact that the majority of the German people actually support their leader Hitler. Since we have set the overthrow of Hitler as our war goal, this work must not wait for the Germans to do it themselves. Since the Nazi Party came to power, the authorities of that country have constantly instilled an idea into young people's minds, saying that they are the sole inheritors of true civilization, and that Hitler is the incarnation of God on earth, and that the people of countries outside their borders are barbaric and uncivilized nations. The only way we can make the young people of that country realize that Hitler is a false god is to work hard to overthrow him. Conversely, if we allow him to succeed, then the German youth will definitely continue to worship him. Hitler knows very well that the price of winning on the Western Front is high and risky, so he intends to avoid the real and attack the weak, changing his course to Scandinavia. His intention is to win the support of the people by achieving victory." (Havas dispatch, 7th)

London - According to Moscow Radio today, one of the reasons for the dismissal of British War Secretary Hore-Belisha was his opposition to the transportation of British military supplies to Finland. (Associated Press dispatch, 7th)

(Reuters dispatch, 7th)

Paris - Italian newspapers report that France has informally proposed preconditions for peace talks. This statement has been denied by responsible parties in France. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

London - A diplomatic affairs reporter for the Tribune recently declared that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently conveyed a letter to Hitler through the German ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, briefly stating that Italy intends to propose a peace plan. However, if Britain and France reject it, then Germany and the Soviet Union must completely break, and Italy can continue to support Germany. In Spain, regardless of the situation, Italy will follow Italy's lead completely. In addition, after the Soviet Union's attacks on Finland suffered repeated setbacks, all the leaders of the German Nazi Party, except Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, deeply believed that there was no benefit to concluding a military alliance treaty with the Soviet Union. For this reason, Aviation Minister General Göring (whose power has been increasing since he took complete control of Germany's wartime economy) intends to launch a purge. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop may be the first to be sacrificed. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### No Progress in Philippe Shooting Case; Denials of Capture of Assailants; Philippe Declares No Personal Grievances; Widespread Condolences

Philippe, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, survived an assassination attempt by a thug disguised as a rickshaw puller as he traveled from his residence on Haig Road to the Council offices on the morning of the 6th. Fortunately, Philippe and his chauffeur were alert and avoided the attack unharmed. Yesterday was a routine Sunday holiday, and Philippe rested at home. Well-wishers who visited or telephoned to express their condolences were numerous. According to information received by this reporter, consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai and key figures in the naval community, as well as Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, and Wu Yushu all expressed their condolences to Philippe successively. Du Yuesheng also arrived at Philippe's residence in his specially equipped armored car at 5:00 PM the previous day to express his condolences. According to Philippe, he has absolutely no enemies and cannot figure out the motive for the assassination attempt. Philippe's near-fatal incident is the second case in Shanghai's history where a high-ranking official of the Municipal Council has been assassinated. In 1925, Municipal Council Director-General Fessenden was also assassinated.

Apparent Careful Planning

The North China Daily News reports that Philippe, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was attacked by a thug with a box cannon yesterday (6th) morning as he traveled by car from his residence on Haig Road to the Council offices. Fortunately, he was not injured. Philippe is now of course under the protection of special bodyguards. Although Philippe does not understand the motive for the assassination attempt, he is certain that the thug who first committed the act looked directly at him before firing. In addition, the thug's careful planning and execution of this assassination attempt suggests a political motive behind the scenes. It is reported that after committing the crime, the thug immediately fled into an alley leading to "Dad's." He was subsequently captured by "outside" authorities but not handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Police. A few minutes after the incident, Philippe went to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station to report everything, and then went to the Council to handle his morning duties as if nothing had happened.

Genuine "Rickshaw Puller" Briefly Detained

According to general sources, Philippe is an important figure in the negotiations regarding the Municipal Council's cross-boundary road construction in the western district of the Public Concession. To Philippe's knowledge, he has no enemies and has not received threatening letters. He is at a loss to understand the motive for the assassination attempt. The thug was disguised as a rickshaw puller and was pulling a rickshaw. The genuine rickshaw puller was taken to a teahouse in Rongqing Lane (phonetic) next to Jessfield Road by thugs yesterday morning. His clothes were also stripped off, and he was detained in the teahouse. He was released only after the thug committed the crime.

Japanese Side Denies Capturing Assailants

It is widely believed that the three people involved in the assassination of Philippe have been captured by armed groups in a village near the site of the shooting on Haig Road in the western district. However, the Japanese authorities have not received any notification of the capture of the thugs. As of late last night, the Japanese side was still investigating. Japanese military authorities denied last night that the municipal police had handed over the assassin to the Japanese military for detention. They also denied newspaper reports that Major General Simons, commander of the British forces in the Shanghai area, had protested to the Japanese Gendarmerie about "an attempted assassination of a British person within the British military zone."

Only Willing to Cooperate in Investigating Criminals

The British military authorities heard that the criminals had been captured by the municipal police and handed over to the Japanese military and police authorities for detention. Therefore, they requested the Japanese Gendarmerie yesterday afternoon to hand over the criminals in order to bring them to justice. However, according to Japanese military sources last night, it has been ascertained that the criminals who assassinated Philippe were not captured by the municipal police. Therefore, there has been no handover to the Japanese Gendarmerie for detention. The Japanese authorities also stated that the Japanese Gendarmerie and the municipal police bureau are fully cooperating with the police and other law enforcement agencies to investigate the criminals.

Case Should Be Under British Military Jurisdiction

The Continental Times also reported that the British military authorities have stated to the Japanese side that this attempted assassination case occurred within British military jurisdiction. Philippe was very frightened yesterday. After handling his official duties at the Council, he spent most of the day at his private residence. Friends and others went to express their condolences and congratulate him on his escape. "Mayor" Du Yuesheng also visited Philippe's residence at 5:00 PM in an armored bulletproof car.

French Concession Imposes Strict Security

After the shooting occurred at 9:15 AM yesterday, the French Concession immediately dispatched a patrol car equipped with a machine gun to guard Philippe's residence. A small squad of plainclothes police officers was also stationed there. It is reported that after the three thugs committed the crime, they fled into a straw hut and were captured by armed bodyguards from the New New Entertainment Company and taken to the Japanese Gendarmerie headquarters on Jessfield Road. However, the Japanese side has denied this.

Examination of Bullet Casings Also Yields Nothing

Police firearms experts have examined the ten bullet casings recovered from the scene of the incident and have learned that the firearms used by the thugs to assassinate Philippe had no prior criminal record. This reporter recently asked responsible parties for possible explanations for this attempted assassination case, but all were at a loss for an answer. Some called it a "misunderstanding," but when the word "misunderstanding" was mentioned, it was impossible not to laugh, because this view was rather forced.

Philippe States No Personal Enemies

Philippe himself told reporters that he could not imagine the possible motive for the assassination attempt, and that he had no personal enemies. On October 20 of last year, the "municipal police" attempted to seize the traffic lights of the Police Department at Yu Garden Road and Yidingpan Road without success. Five plainclothes officers were dispatched to "threaten" the public concession patrolmen managing the traffic lights. As a result, the plainclothes officers opened fire, killing one Chinese patrolman and injuring one Indian patrolman. The Municipal Council then issued a sternly worded official communiqué signed by Philippe.

Recalling Last Year's Content

The communiqué stated briefly, "The cowardly attack on personnel of the Public Concession Police Department will shock Shanghai and the governments of all countries with residents in China. Prior to this, the Chinese administrative organs had never attempted to use force to expel the Municipal Council from the area. The Municipal Council is now facing a threat of force, which is seriously endangering law and order. The Municipal Council now has a need to maintain a position that is threatened by those who disregard the rights and interests that all countries have worked hard to establish in the western district for many years."

Two Detectives Responsible for Protection

The Shanghai Times also reported that after three thugs attempted to assassinate Philippe yesterday morning, the Public Concession Police Department took special precautions at Philippe's residence and dispatched one Chinese and one Western detective to be assigned by Philippe for his protection. Plainclothes police officers were also stationed on and near Haig Road. It is also reported that Philippe has a steel plate that can be raised within one second to cover the car windows. Detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station are currently investigating how the thugs obtained the rickshaw and rickshaw puller's clothing.

### Yesterday's Massacre on Dagu Road; Chen Yuqin Shot Dead; Death from Serious Injuries from Bullets to Left Waist and Head; A Passing Pedestrian Injured by Stray Bullet

A shooting occurred on Dagu Road in the Public Concession yesterday morning, and the victim died on the spot. The details are as follows:

(Bullet Hits Vital Points)

At around 1:00 PM yesterday, as a man was walking through the Dagu Road farmers market, a sudden assassin fired at him. At the time, the man was shot in the left waist, penetrating to the back, and was also shot in the head. He collapsed to the ground in agony, bleeding profusely and on his last breath. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the assassin quickly fled into the crowd and disappeared without a trace.

(Died Soon After)

Police officers nearby heard the news and rushed to surround and arrest the assailant. At the same time, they reported to the police station, which sent a large number of detectives to search. The wounded man was taken to the hospital by car, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died before he could be treated. The police station began investigating his name and residence, and sent the body by car to the coroner's office for examination.

(Injured a Passerby)

When the shooting occurred, the assassin fired several shots in succession, causing one bullet to hit a pedestrian named Shi Kangle, a 24-year-old paint merchant from Changzhou who lived upstairs at the Haoleyi Restaurant on Zhujia Bridge in the French Concession. However, his injuries were light, and he was discharged from the hospital after treatment.

(Currently a Teacher)

It was later learned that the man who was assassinated was named Chen Yuqin, from Ningbo, 31 years old, residing at 91 Dagu Road. He was a graduate of the Central Military Academy, and had served as the deputy commander of bandit suppression in Jiangxi. He later left his post and came to Shanghai. After the "August 13th" Incident, he served as a teacher at China Girls' High School and Shanghai Minli Girls' High School. Yesterday, Chen and his wife, Yuexia, went out shopping and unexpectedly encountered the assassination. The police station is currently investigating the case.

### Stable Rice Price Committee Issues Declaration: Appeals for Donations to Stabilize Rice Prices, Hopes All Sectors Will Act with a Sense of Hunger and Drowning to Save the Poor from Fire and Water

The Shanghai Stable Rice Price Committee held a plenary committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. More than ten people, including Yu Qiaqing, attended. Yu Qiaqing chaired the meeting, and Yang Youlong served as the secretary. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, discussions began. (1) Election of standing committee members: It was resolved to elect Yu Qiaqing, Wu Yunzhai, Xu Jiyin, Guo Shun, Wang Yuqing, Pei Yunqing, Zhang Zemin, Cao Xingeng, Chen Ziyu, Fan Guifu, Tian Xialin, Ding Fangyuan, Shen Weiting, and Zhang Nianxuan as standing committee members. (2) Appointment of financial committee members: It was resolved to appoint Wu Yunzhai, Pei Yunqing, and Wang Yuqing as financial committee members. (3) Appointment of secretaries: It was resolved to appoint Sun Beiyuan as the chief secretary and Yang Youlong as the secretary. (4) The association's charter and declaration: It was resolved to amend and approve them. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

Declaration for Donations

The Shanghai Stable Rice Price Committee's declaration for donations to stabilize rice prices states: "As the ancient saying goes, 'Food is the people's heaven,' it is evident how important food is to the people. Recently, rice prices in this city have soared, creating an unprecedented record. People are struggling to survive; the weak fill the ditches, and the strong resort to desperate measures, leading to social unrest, public panic, and a precarious outlook for public security. Various industries and businesses are also affected. The authorities of the concessions and concerned individuals from all walks of life, in view of this situation, have already announced a strict ban on price gouging and collectively purchased foreign rice to provide relief. Middle-class families and above may be able to temporarily cope, but the general poor, who live day to day, still feel that it is not reaching them. Therefore, we believe that appealing for donations to stabilize rice prices and actively handling stable rice prices is the most urgent task. We have established this committee to specifically handle stable rice price matters, continuously purchasing rice and selling it at reduced prices to relieve the common people and fulfill the duty of mutual assistance. However, given the vastness of the concession area in this city and the large number of poor people, we plan to raise one million yuan in donations to stabilize rice prices. Although our colleagues have tried their best to raise funds, and people from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated, it is like a drop in the bucket and still relies on the efforts of everyone. This meeting has resolved to designate the Zhongnan Bank, Jincheng Bank, Shanghai Bank, Zifeng Zhuang, and Tongrun Zhuang as collecting agencies. Fundraising will begin immediately, and active efforts will be made to implement stable rice price measures within the shortest possible time. We dare to ask people from all walks of life, acting with a sense of hunger and drowning, to donate grain and money generously. This would not only be a blessing for the poor people of this city. We issue this declaration, hoping for your attention. Shanghai Stable Rice Price Committee respectfully announces, address: 93 Guangdong Road."

### Three Chinese Detectives Suddenly Arrested: Patrolling on Connaught Road Yesterday, Suddenly Detained by Japanese Military Police

Yesterday at 2:30 PM, Chinese detectives 2517 and 3069 from the Gordon Road Police Station and another Chinese detective, a total of three, were inspecting pedestrians near Connaught Road, a road built by the Shanghai Municipal Council outside the concession in western Shanghai. Unexpectedly, a machine in a Japanese-controlled gambling den reported to the Japanese military police headquarters and falsely accused the three detectives of extortion. The Japanese military police immediately arrived armed and detained the three detectives. At the same time, the police station also sent personnel to investigate after hearing the news. The two sides negotiated for three-quarters of an hour, but as a result, the three Chinese detectives were still taken away by the Japanese military police. The police station is currently negotiating.

### Muslims Have Risen Up: Loyal to the Government in Fighting the War, Muslim Representatives Promote the Significance of the War of Resistance, Japan's Efforts to Entice Have Completely Failed

Dalu Bao reports: Mr. Hufo of the YMCA, an expert in Chinese Islam, traveled in the provinces south of the Yangtze River for two and a half months. He recently returned to Shanghai and told reporters yesterday (6th) that representatives of the newly established Chinese Islamic Association are now in the vast Muslim villages of northwestern China and in the bustling capitals of Eastern Muslim countries, publicizing the reasons for China's war against Japan. Approximately 100,000 Muslims will soon be traveling from all over the world to

(Mecca) for the annual pilgrimage. Chinese Muslim representatives are now there, telling the public that Chinese Muslims have declared their allegiance to the National Government and are participating in the war, and are filled with grief and indignation at the bombing of mosques by Japanese planes. Japan is trying to win over China's 50 million Muslims to side with Japan and convince other Muslims that Japan will win. Japan's goal is not only to deceive these 50 million Chinese, but also because Chinese Muslims mostly live in

(the region between China and the Soviet Union). If Japan can spread its influence in that region, it will cut off the supply of weapons from the Soviet Union to Chongqing. The organization of the Beijing Muslim United Association on February 7, 1938, was the first step in Japan's attempt to induce Muslims to believe in the "New Order in East Asia." The Japanese side also sent representatives of the United Association, together with Muslims from "Manchukuo," to travel to India, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, and Iraq, and then to Mecca, to engage in propaganda. Therefore, a fierce battle is currently being waged between Chongqing and Tokyo in the area of spiritual obedience in the Muslim world, but

(Japan's own) actions are the most powerful counter-evidence to Japan's propaganda. In this regard, Mr. Hu obtained a powerful example in a Muslim village in northwestern China. At that time, a representative of the Chinese Islamic National Salvation Association was speaking to a gathering of quiet men, women, and children, shouting, "The Japanese say they are your friends, so why do they bomb our mosques, burn our homes, and kill our clergymen?" Japan

(trying to entice) Muslims and bombing mosques in China is a major mistake. News of the bombing of mosques has spread throughout the provinces, arousing Muslim anger. Many Muslims have also been killed in Japanese air raids. At least one mosque has been destroyed in each of China's major Muslim cities that have been ravaged by Japanese aircraft, such as Xi'an, Guilin, Wanxian, and Chongqing. In addition, countless Muslim homes have also been destroyed. It is estimated that the losses in Chengdu alone have reached

(five to six hundred thousand) yuan. Since Chinese Muslims have been devastated by the Japanese side, the establishment of the Beijing Muslim United Association and those who promote on behalf of the Japanese side abroad are merely due to pressure and uneven quality. The work of the Chinese Islamic Association

(is not in propaganda) but in awakening Muslims, making them understand that Japan is not fighting against Chongqing, but against the entire Chinese population. Armies composed of Chinese Muslims are now fighting against Japan, and there are also Muslim guerrillas. Normally, there are about 40,000 to 50,000 Muslims in the national army. Since the start of the war, this number has at least doubled. Mr. Hu then recounted the general situation of Chinese Muslims since the 13th century, saying that after the establishment of the Republic of China, the government and

(Muslim leaders) felt the need for close contact. The government established Muslim schools, provided relief to poor Muslims, and sent representatives to the Northwest. Chairman Chiang and other officials participated in Muslim gatherings. Thus, a new connection was formed, and the organization of the Chinese Islamic National Salvation Association by Muslims has reached the final step in the complete unity of the government and Muslims.

### Assassination of Gambling Den Manager: Wang Shouzhong Under Interrogation, Mastermind Arrested in Hong Kong, Extradited to Shanghai and Confesses Unreservedly

Zhang Kangmei, the head of the Yongyuan gambling den in Yongyuanbang, was shot and killed at 8:40 PM on July 28, 1939, on Jing'an Temple Road, Difeng Road. Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station, detectives Chen Yaoting, Sun Wenxi, Zhang Kuidong, Wu Xiuqing, and others, arrested a number of suspects, including Zhang Shundong, Mao Xiangyun, and Wang Dezhi, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and punishment. However, during the court hearing, Mao Xiangyun and others confessed that the mastermind of the case was Wang Shouzhong (aka Little Wang) from Baoshan. An order was issued

to hunt down the suspect.

It has now been learned that Wang Shouzhong was arrested at the Da Kuan Hotel in Hong Kong. He was extradited to Shanghai a few days ago. Under the investigation of Detective Shao and others from the Chengdu Road Police Station, it was learned that in addition to ordering the murder of Zhang Kangmei, Wang also used a pistol to shoot Gao Jingen, Zhang Kangmei's apprentice, at 7:15 PM on March 19th last year at No. 121, Lane 1912, Jing'an Temple Road, with the intention of murdering him. The police sent Wang to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court this morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law and presented the case, saying that the defendant Wang Shouzhong and the deceased Zhang Kangmei were both

Yongyuan Gambling Den

shareholders. Because Wang injured Zhang's apprentice Gao Jingen with a gun, Wang was expelled by Zhang, which led to resentment. He ordered Zhang to be shot and killed. Wang now has a confession recorded at the police station. Please investigate. Wang Shouzhong confessed that he used to be the captain of the detective team in the Baoshan County government. He lost his job after the outbreak of the war. In March 1938, he opened a small gambling den with Ge Sansan in Yongyuanbang. In July of last year, he split up with Ge and opened the Yongyuan gambling den in the same place with Zhang Kangmei, Zhou Zhongru, and Hou Cailiang. The capital was 6,000 yuan, and Zhang Kangmei was appointed as the manager. Zhou and Hou managed the internal affairs, and I was responsible for external relations. Later, because

profits were quite high,

the shareholders decided that Zhang would receive a daily salary of 50 yuan, and the three of us would each receive a daily salary of 42 yuan. The remaining profits would be divided equally. In March of last year, in the accounting room of the gambling den, I saw Gao Jingen, a staff member on the table, nicknamed "Duck Gizzard Liver," privately throwing a letter out of the window. The letter was addressed to me and was intended to extort 10,000 yuan. The signatory was the Youth Iron Blood Corps. I questioned Gao, and we exchanged harsh words. In a moment of anger, I took out a pistol from the drawer of the gambling table and shot Gao down. I was also frightened and

left to take refuge,

but my daily salary was still paid. In May, my salary was suddenly stopped by Zhang Kangmei. Although I asked someone to inquire, it was said that business was not good. On July 28th of this year, Zhang was assassinated. I met his apprentice Xia Dehai, who told me the news of Zhang's murder. I replied that I already knew. In November, I went to Hong Kong and stayed in Room 507 of the Da Kuan Hotel. On December 6th, I was arrested while visiting a friend at the Six Nations Hotel, etc. The presiding judge verified the confession and ordered Han Shouzhong to be detained and waited for a rescheduled hearing.

### Counterfeiters Awaiting Judgment After Trial

Wang Chengying, a Chinese detective from the Gordon Road Police Station, and detective Xu Decheng, between the 21st of last month, arrested seven people, including Liu Jizhong from Tianjin, Liu Xueke from Shandong, Zhang Keqin, and a woman, Liu Sun's wife, at No. 12, Xinzha Road, No. 36, Tai'an Lane, Datong Road, and Beijing Road, etc., and seized more than 2,660 counterfeit 5-yuan banknotes of the Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks. They were sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. The case was continued to be heard by Judge Huang Jiusheng in the Third Criminal Court the other day. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a public prosecution for the crime of counterfeiting currency under Article 196, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and stated that according to the confessions of the defendants Liu Jizhong and Zhang Keqin, the source of this large amount of counterfeit currency was Zhang Baolin, Cao Zida, and Chen Zhaolan, who are at large. They have changed the date, but they cannot be arrested. Please handle this case strictly, he said. The defendants all stammered and shifted the blame to the instigation of Zhang, Cao, and Chen, who are at large, and begged for leniency. Judge Huang ordered them to be remanded in custody.

### Puppet Official Scares and Extorts Dance Hostess: False and Shameless Confession, Claiming to Protect Weak Women, Insisting on Being an Older Brother to the Woman, Woman's Mother Proves They Are Not Relatives

Sheng Jinqing, the owner of the Shengyi Xing cotton cloth shop at 460 Beijing Road, a native of this city, was fascinated by Tang Ying, a dance hostess at the Paramount Ballroom. Zhang Fengyi, a puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government Land Bureau" clerk from Jilin, colluded with Xin Dingsheng from Ningbo and Xu Ming from Lanxi, and falsely accused Sheng of raping Tang Ying and intending to abandon her. They extorted 20,000 yuan from Sheng, threatening to take him to the Japanese military headquarters as a deterrent. At noon on the 24th of last month, at the Daxin Restaurant, because

the extortion failed,

they violently beat Sheng and his wife, Ren. They attempted to kidnap Sheng, but Sheng and Ren called the police. Zhang and the other two were arrested one after another and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. The case was continued to be heard by Judge Feng Shide in the First Criminal Court the other day. Xin Dingsheng and Xu Ming hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Zhang Fukang to defend them. First, police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that after the change of date, the police investigation found that the three defendants did have a joint extortion plot, so they were prosecuted under Article 346, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law and requested that they be punished according to the law. Then, Sheng Jinqing and his wife testified about how

they were threatened

(details omitted as they were in the previous report). The court then asked the defendant Zhang Fengyi to claim that he and Tang Ying were relatives, so he ordered Tang Ying's grandmother and aunt (both Tang Gu's) to be brought to court. First, Tang Ying's grandmother, Tang Gu's, testified that she was from Nanxiang, residing at 992 Peng Road. Tang Ying was her own daughter. She had never met Zhang Fengyi and was not related to him at all. She herself was from Nanxiang, named Tang Gu's, and had nothing to do with the defendant's mother, Kimura, a Japanese woman.

Where did the relative

relationship come from, etc. Then, Tang Ying's aunt, Tang Gu's, said that after the incident, she questioned Tang Ying, who said that she was introduced to Sheng Jinqing by Xu Ming. Later, Xu and others told her that Mr. Sheng was going to abandon her. She felt that this matter was not only related to her whole life but also difficult to explain to her parents, and she could not help but feel angry. The defendants then said that they had their own ways of dealing with it, both with words and force. Tang expressed that she did not want to take such bad actions. The defendants' various actions

Tang did not know about.

Regarding Tang Ying's admission in court last time that she and Zhang Fengyi were relatives, it was said that she was surrounded by the defendants' accomplices and had no choice but to say so, etc. Zhang Fengyi confessed that he and the others heard that Sheng Jinqing would abandon Tang Ying after seducing her. In order to protect the weak woman and for reasons of law, humanity, morality, and ethics, we came forward to help. However, there was no extortion of 20,000 yuan. The court asked what kind of identity he was helping Tang Ying with. Zhang still insisted that he and Tang were relatives. Xin Dingsheng also denied extortion. Xu Ming confessed that he was familiar with Sheng because Sheng had a very

secret disease

and went to my brother for treatment. He had not participated in the extortion at all. Finally, police lawyer Ru's closing argument stated that the defendants were all highly educated and had considerable professions. Now they are acting like hooligans, which is unforgivable. They should be severely punished according to the law, etc. After the three lawyers Fan, Yu, and Zhang defended the two defendants Xin and Xu, Judge Feng Shide declared the debate closed and scheduled a date for judgment. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Ordered 100,000 Tons of Smoke and White Coal

Foreign Exchange Loosens, Prices Slightly Lower

Previously, due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange and increased costs, and with the outbreak of the European war, various coal-producing regions banned the export of coal, resulting in a shortage of supply and a sudden increase in market prices. In January, all goods were generally priced 7-8 yuan per ton higher. Subsequently, the coal industry gradually telegraphed coal-producing regions such as India and Annam to order coal, and they were continuously shipped to Shanghai for adjustment. Market prices have stabilized. According to news from the coal industry, the foreign exchange is now loosening, and coal prices are not as expensive as before. In order to prepare for a rainy day and increase inventory, they have already telegraphed foreign countries separately to order a large quantity of smoke and white coal to be shipped to Shanghai for storage for future needs. It is heard that the total amount is about 100,000 tons, which will be continuously loaded onto ships and shipped to Shanghai. Currently, the inventory of various coal stores in Shanghai is estimated to be 300,000 tons. The coal industry deeply agrees with the committee members of the Citizens' Federation's suggestion to purchase coal in groups and will also participate in the ordering. The current market price of coal dust is 75 yuan or 68 yuan per ton, and the wholesale price of coal balls from the industry is 76 yuan per ton, with a retail price of 4 yuan or 4.1 yuan per dan (100 market catties).

### Postal Bureau Messengers Did Not Neglect Duty

Messengers Disciplined for Failing to Deliver New Year Cards

Zha Peilin, Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau, previously dismissed three messengers from the Engineering Department, Sun Jiading, Wang Jianquan, and Xu Bangchong, for refusing to go to the bureau to deliver letters. Reports of this led to rumors of negligence. However, according to our reporter's investigation, the situation is

slightly different.

It seems that the Director of the Shanghai Postal Bureau, following an order from the Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications, instructed that New Year's cards received by January 1st should be delivered on that day as much as possible to reflect the meaning of New Year's greetings. Since the implementation of this rule, it has been well received by the public. He specifically ordered

all messengers

to deliver once in the morning. It is known that delivering New Year cards on New Year's Day was an order from the Ministry of Communications relayed from the National Government, a formal notice of admonition. Unexpectedly, three messengers, Sun Jiading, et al., considered New Year's Day a national holiday mandated by the National Government, where

everyone should celebrate the New Year

Therefore, they were unwilling to deliver on that day, resulting in the failure to deliver New Year's mail within the Postal Bureau's jurisdiction on that day. Director Zha was quite angered by this and summoned the messengers for questioning on the fourth. However, the three messengers, Sun Jiading, et al., again

defied the order by not appearing,

leading to their dismissal. Upon hearing this, the Postal Workers' Union interceded on behalf of the messengers, stating that they were usually diligent in their work and their refusal to deliver New Year's cards was due to being misled by others. They specially pleaded with Director Zha to show leniency. Director Zha, recognizing that the messengers were somewhat remorseful, but believing that public affairs should not be relaxed, ordered that each be given a major demerit as a warning.

### Missing Western Child Declares Loyalty to Motherland

### Rumors of Domestic Postage Increase

Six Cents for Domestic Ordinary Mail, Three Cents for Local Mail

The Shanghai Times reports that rumors of an imminent increase in domestic postage have been circulating for the past two weeks, but have not been confirmed until now. Yesterday (the 6th), a reliable source said that the Ministry of Communications is currently considering an immediate increase in domestic postage. The new rates will be six cents for ordinary domestic mail in China and three cents for local mail. Registered and express mail will also increase proportionally. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications is currently printing new stamps with a face value of six cents.

### French Municipal Council Measures Land in the Western District

### Female Hostess Shot, Zhang Pinxi Wounded in the Abdomen by a Bullet

At approximately 7:00 AM yesterday, Zhang Pinxi, a young woman residing in a garret at 154 Kaifeng Road, was suddenly invaded by a man who behaved indecently. After Zhang cried out, the man opened fire, hitting Zhang in the abdomen with a bullet. The woman was injured and cried for help. Afterwards, the police arrived and took her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The young woman is from Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, and is thirty years old. She worked as a hostess at the Tianyunlou Amusement Park in Wing On Company. According to the woman, she did not know the man who came.

### Northeast Winds Blow Tightly, Local Weather Turns Cold

The local weather has been quite warm due to the influence of a Mongolian low-pressure system moving southeast, resembling early summer weather. However, a high-pressure system is now forming in Siberia, so the climate in Tianjin and Beijing has shifted from warm to cold. In this city, the northeast wind blew tightly from last night, and the cold is gradually increasing. Therefore, according to the astronomical observatory's prediction, the climate will soon turn cold.

### Social News

At around 2:30 PM yesterday, another shooting occurred at the intersection of Wuding Road and Gordon Road in the Public Concession. A pedestrian, Shen Changfa, was passing by when he was hit by a stray bullet and injured.

Yang Jinfa, a native of Songjiang, is 28 years old and works as a clerk in a customs brokerage on Sanma Road. He lives at 5 Hejia Lane, Fahua Town, western Shanghai. However, Yang often frequents gambling dens in western Shanghai, resulting in heavy debts. He became weary of life and secretly swallowed opium at home to commit suicide the night before last. It was not until yesterday morning that his family discovered him, but he had already died of asphyxiation.

### Overview of the Promotion of Free Education in China (4)

(6) Compulsory Enrollment and Methods for Deferral and Exemption

Promoting free education requires countries to establish compulsory education policies and enforce them. Otherwise, it is difficult to implement. Although our country does not have specific regulations for this, it is briefly stipulated in the Outline of the Plan for Implementing Free Education and the Implementing Rules. The methods are as follows:

A. Compulsory Enrollment: In areas where ordinary primary schools and short-term primary schools have enough space to accommodate local school-age children, all healthy school-age children should be supervised by the local free education authorities to enroll according to their age and family circumstances.

Those who should enroll but do not shall be given advice for a certain period of time to attend school by the family or guardian. Those who do not accept the advice will have their names publicized, and those who still do not comply may be fined by the county or city education administrative agency from one yuan to five yuan by the county or city government and ordered to enroll within a limited time. B. Deferral and Exemption: For school-age children who have illnesses or other reasons why they cannot enroll temporarily, their parents or guardians may request a deferral in writing. Those with chronic illnesses who cannot attend school may be exempted by their parents or guardians in writing.

(7) Review of the Results of the Promotion of Free Education in Various Provinces and Cities

A. Promotion Procedures

(1) Regarding the division of primary school districts, investigation of school-age children, and determination of school locations: The Outline of the Plan for Implementing Free Education and the Implementing Rules stipulate that the first step in promoting free education must be to divide the counties and cities of each province into several primary school districts, each primary school district based on approximately one thousand people. This may be adapted according to the population density, local traffic conditions, and existing local autonomy or baojia organizations. Therefore, the division of primary school districts, whether it is a newly designated area, an existing local autonomous area, or an existing baojia area, must be clearly defined as the smallest grassroots unit for promoting free education and setting up primary schools in various places. If this level cannot be implemented, then all investigations of school-age children and the establishment of new schools cannot be realized. Except for Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Shaanxi provinces, which use bao as the unit for setting up schools, and Shanxi Province, which uses villages as the unit, the remaining provinces and cities have not determined this grassroots institution. Therefore, the exact number of school-age children in each small unit cannot be investigated, and plans for increasing the number of various types of primary schools cannot be predetermined. This is truly a major reason why it is not easy to realize the promotion of free education. Therefore, all facilities and plans are almost fictional. In the future, we should follow the county organization outline, use bao as the smallest unit for setting up national schools, and urge provinces and cities to realize this in a short period of time.

(2) Regarding the establishment of education commissions at all levels: The Outline of the Provisional Measures for Implementing Free Education and the Implementing Rules stipulate that all levels of free education authorities should organize free education committees to assist in the implementation of free education. The main tasks of the provincial, municipal, and county free education committees are: (a) to prepare a promotion plan for free education in the province, city, or county; (b) to supervise the custody and use of free education funds and free education funds granted by the central government; (c) to review the budget and final accounts of free education funds; (d) to assess the performance of free education, etc. The importance of these agencies is self-evident. Most provinces, counties, and cities were able to establish them successively within the 24th year, but very few were able to implement the prescribed tasks effectively, resulting in nominal agencies that could not be effective in promoting free education. Therefore, in the future, the central government should first improve the organization of the Central Free Education Committee and then directly supervise and direct the free education committees of various provinces and cities, so that they can give full play to their prescribed functions.

(3) Regarding the administrative agencies of free education at all levels: The soundness of the education administrative agency is greatly related to the promotion of free education. The Ministry of Education has always advocated restoring the original county education bureau so that it can preside over the education administration of a county, especially when promoting compulsory education. However, in fact, the provinces not only could not maintain the position of their county education bureaus, but after changing to set up education sections, they could not set them up independently, often combining them with construction to form one section, which had a great impact on the original education undertakings in the locality, and the newly promoted free education plan could not be realized. This is the only reason why the promotion of compulsory education in various provinces, counties, and cities has been severely hit. In the future, we should urge the provinces to pay attention to this and improve the education administrative institutions of each county so that the promotion of free education can proceed smoothly. B. Promotion Methods

(1) Regarding the increase in one-year short-term primary schools: During the first five years of the implementation of the compulsory education plan ("from the 24th year to the 28th year of the Republic of China"), it was advocated to first set up one-year short-term primary schools in view of the difficulty in raising free education funds in various provinces so that their promotion would be easy and widespread. Since the promotion, the first year's results ("24th year") showed that a total of 25,901 short-term primary schools were added nationwide, and a total of 11,931 short-term classes were attached. In the second year ("25th year"), 38,117 short primary schools and 21,444 short primary classes were added. The number of short-term primary schools and classes added is considerable. The increase in the number of school-age children enrolled after the promotion of free education depends on these short-term primary schools to accommodate them. However, the original regulations stipulated that each short-term primary school should have a two-part system, and one class could accommodate twice as many students. In fact, very few implemented the two-part system, so the number of students enrolled did not reach the predetermined standard.

(2) Regarding the increase in ordinary primary schools and the increase in grades in ordinary primary schools, the increase in ordinary primary schools and the widespread establishment of short-term primary schools were originally parallel and non-contradictory methods for promoting free education. The establishment of short primary schools was originally a flexible method for economic difficulties. If local funds are sufficient, ordinary primary schools can be added as a fundamental solution. In the 24th year, 35,158 ordinary primary schools were added in various provinces and cities, and 211 grades were added in ordinary primary schools. In the 25th year, 13,291 ordinary primary schools and 295 classes were added in ordinary primary schools. The numbers are also considerable. As for the two-part system classes attached to ordinary primary schools, there were 773 classes in the 24th year and 1,916 classes in the 25th year. In addition, various provinces also added simplified primary schools, with 144 in the 24th year and 161 in the 25th year.

### Sichuan Province Selects Graduates from Senior and Junior High Schools

To be Sent to Various Counties' Drug Rehabilitation Centers

(Chengdu Correspondence) The Sichuan Provincial Anti-Smoking Supervision Office was officially established on December 16th to unify the province's anti-smoking administration, supervise the prohibition of planting, transporting, selling, and smoking, and eliminate private stockpiles of opium. All former Soil Suppression Offices, etc., will be merged at the end of the year, with a unified deadline at the end of the year, and 100 new drug rehabilitation centers will be established to train cadres and urge counties and cities to implement them. Hu Ciwei, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, proposed that graduates from senior high schools and equivalent schools be sent to various counties to prepare for drug rehabilitation. The plan to slightly change the qualifications and treatment has been passed by the provincial government meeting the day before yesterday. The original plan roughly stated that in order to select 300 graduates from senior and junior high schools or above to be sent to various counties to prepare for the establishment of drug rehabilitation centers, it was discussed at the meeting, and it was resolved that the selection qualifications should be based on graduates from senior high schools and equivalent schools. Those with equivalent academic qualifications may also be selected. During the internship period, in addition to food, each person will be paid a living allowance of 20 yuan per month, and the Department of Education and the Health Experimental Office must handle the registration. Now, after consultation with the Department of Education and the Health Experimental Office, it has been decided that the qualifications of the director and administrator of the drug rehabilitation center should be stipulated separately. The director of the drug rehabilitation center must be a graduate of a senior high school or equivalent school with service experience, with a quota of 100 people. Administrators must be graduates of junior high schools or equivalent schools aged 20 or older, with a quota of 300 people. In addition, accommodation and stationery supplies will be provided during the training period, and no subsidies will be given. After the training, the monthly salary of the director of the drug rehabilitation center will still be 70 yuan for the first class, 60 yuan for the second class, and 50 yuan for the third class. The monthly salary of the administrator will be reduced to 40 yuan for the first class, 35 yuan for the second class, and 30 yuan for the third class. However, directors and administrators of drug rehabilitation centers who are sent to work in remote counties will be given a travel allowance at discretion.

### Ever-Victorious Army Invariably Triumphant, Lido Massively Defeats Northern Foreign Students, Six to One, Three Goals in Each Half, Northern Foreign Students Escape Shutout with Penalty Kick

In the Group A football league, Lido once again achieved the glorious record of eight wins in eight games yesterday, defeating the Northern Foreign Students by a score of six to one at Jiaozhou Park. They won by three goals in the first half, and the Northern Foreign Students were spared total annihilation after being awarded a penalty kick in the second half. Yesterday, Jiaozhou Park was packed with fans, an unprecedented event.

Three in a Row

Lido lined up with the sun at their backs. The student army kicked off, and Cochran broke in to knock on the door, but Chang Lu calmly blocked it. From then on, Lido completely controlled the attack and defense, but the front line was unable to achieve success immediately because the time had not yet come. It was not until the 17th minute that Wu Qixiang took a corner kick, and Ah Sun's shot hit Lugen's leg and bounced back. Huang Kehou added a shot and opened the scoring. In the 35th minute, Tui Tui fired a flat shot from 15 yards away. Sneidich made a mistake, and the ball went into the net. In the 40th minute, Li Yichen passed far to the front line, and Lugen and Tui Weiniq greeted the ball in the air. Qiu Ting braked into the gap and shot powerfully at the goal. Sneidich hugged the ball on the ground, but Huang Kehou rushed in and completed his three-arrow wish. In the first half, Lido won by three goals.

Making a Half Dozen

After changing sides, the melee started again. Cochran kicked from afar, Chang Lu missed, but fortunately it went out. In the 6th minute, Tui Tui's flat shot broke the net, but it was disallowed because Huang Kehou was offside. The Northern Foreign Students burned their boats and attacked with all their might. The two sides were stuck in a deep trench and high垒局, and the game did not open the score for half an hour. In the 31st minute, Huang Kehou picked the ball over Sneidich's head and scored safely (4-0). Then, Lido went downstream again, and the momentum was like splitting bamboo. Seven minutes later, Xu Wenkui slammed into the goalpost, Sneidich missed and did not get up, and Wu Qixiang headed the ball into the empty goal (5-0). In the 30th minute, Zhang Lingen accidentally fouled and was penalized with a penalty kick. Cochran shot into the right corner, and Chang Lu could not save it (5-1). In the 43rd minute, Qiu Ting kicked a high ball, and Huang Kehou headed it over Sneidich's fingertips, completing his "hat trick." Lido also won with a score of six to one. The lineup of the two armies is as follows:

### Final Five Minutes, Donghua Suffers Miserable Defeat, Loses Three to Six to French Business

Donghua and French Business played their second round match at Yiyuan yesterday. Since the departure of many famous players, Donghua's appeal is weak. Yesterday morning, there were less than 500 people in the stands at Yiyuan. French Business's famous player Bao Xiutuo has just returned from overseas, and as a newlywed, he did not play well. If it were not for Donghua's injury and Hu Hanwen's dismissal, it would not have been so easy to win. French Business only scored three goals in the last five minutes after being tied 3-3, and won the final victory with a score of six to three. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw.

Evenly Divided

French Business kicked off, and Donghua's attack was brilliant, but many good opportunities were missed, and Donghua was finally restrained by French Business. As a result, enemy cavalry spread everywhere, and shocking reports came frequently. Shi Peishi finally broke through in the 21st minute. Shi shot remotely from the sidelines. Bi Gaofu unfortunately missed and could not save the ball, so it went into the net after touching the right post. Donghua's counterattack failed. Wan Jintou attacked, Hong Guang slammed, Wan and Wu opened two corner kicks, but they did not get their wish. It was not until the last half minute before the break that Youliang crossed from the sidelines, and Hong Guang pulled up a kick about ten yards from the goal. Hulfei was caught off guard, and the ball fell into the net. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw, evenly divided.

Miserable Defeat at the End

Just ten minutes into the second half, Wan Jin took a corner kick, and Jie Su accidentally patted the ball into the net with his hand. Pan Tuo was penalized with a penalty kick, and Hong Guang scored. Donghua took a 2-1 lead, and the situation was very smooth. Not long after, Jia Youliang withdrew due to a muscle strain, and Donghua only had ten players to fight. The offensive was greatly affected. In the 25th minute, Bao Xiutuo dribbled past Li Gentong and then past Hu Hanwen, and kicked the ball in, making it 2-2. Two minutes later, Li Gentong shoveled someone, and Jie Mu took the penalty kick. Qin Bi Gao blocked the ball with one kick, and the applause was thunderous. After another minute, Hu Hanwen was suddenly dismissed, and Donghua only had nine players left at this point, and the strength was obviously inferior. In the 30th minute, Bao Xiutuo dribbled into the low ground alone and slammed a kick from three yards away, and the ball bounced off the horizontal bar and went in. French Business led again with a score of 3-2. In the 34th minute, Donghua attacked fiercely. Hong Guang and Jing Yong feinted, and Wan Jin pulled a shot from six yards away, making it 3-3. Although Youliang rejoined after this, he felt strenuous to fight with an injury. So in the 40th minute, Bao Xiutuo kicked the ball in from the crowd, 4-3. Two minutes later, Xue Gelun knocked on the door, 5-3. Two minutes later, Robert Stove sprinted and scored, 6-3. Donghua lost three cities in five minutes and suffered a miserable defeat with a score of 3-6.

Therefore, the two sides built deep trenches and high fortresses, and after 90 minutes of fierce fighting, both sides were empty-handed and neither side won or lost. In the extended time, Youyou's famous player Mao Hongfa scored with a low ball from 20 yards away in the tenth minute, and the whole court cheered. After the second change of sides, Youyou's offensive became more prosperous. Mao Hongfa used his sharpshooting again in the seventh minute, winning the bullseye.

### The Gold Coin Management Process Before and After "August 13th"

— Cao Linbi

The silver standard has always been China's monetary standard, with gold merely serving as a decorative item for the public. However, gold and silver maintain a close and indivisible relationship. The fluctuation of gold prices invariably affects silver prices. Consequently, the purchasing power of silver and the exchange rates of silver coins are often influenced by gold price movements. Therefore, financial authorities must implement various effective management methods to restrict and stabilize the gold-silver ratio. In the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), after the authorities reformed the currency system, the buying and selling of silver were directly handled by national banks, but such transactions remained relatively free. The same was true for gold, except that its export was prohibited. As for the determination of Customs Gold Unit fluctuations, the Central Bank indirectly managed it through exchange rates. By monitoring gold price movements and directly participating in market transactions, the Central Bank could suppress speculation and make adjustments as needed. Therefore, its value also stabilized with the stability of the legal tender exchange rate, preventing it from being manipulated by speculators from then on. After "August 13th," the authorities, to strengthen national financial resources, implemented two effective and beneficial measures to collect gold coins from the public.

The Origin and Handling of Customs Gold Units

Customs revenue is the sole source of the national treasury, and any impact from gold price fluctuations would directly reduce revenue. (There are quite a few Arabic numeral errors). Originally, customs used silver taels as the standard. After World War I, silver prices plummeted. In particular, the sharp decline from the end of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929) to the beginning of the 19th year (1930) was extremely severe, with the price of silver falling to below 18 pence per ounce. As a result, customs revenue and the repayment of foreign debt were adversely affected. To avert this crisis, the government promulgated a decree on January 15th of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), mandating the collection of customs duties in gold currency. This abandoned the consistent silver standard policy and created a hypothetical customs gold unit, abbreviated as Customs Gold Unit. Each Customs Gold Unit was defined as containing 0.601866 grams of pure gold, equivalent to 0.01935 troy ounces. Fixed exchange rates between the Customs Gold Unit and various foreign currencies were also stipulated, including 0.8025 Japanese yen, 19.7265 British pence, 0.4 U.S. gold dollars, 10.184 French francs, 0.705 Singapore Straits dollars, 1.096 Indian rupees, 1.679 German marks, 0.995 Dutch guilders, 7.60 Italian lire, 2.73 Swiss francs, 2.877 Belgian belgas, and 1.492 kroner each for Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and 2.8 Austrian schillings.

Starting on February 1st of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), regardless of the original currency of imported goods, the value had to be converted into Customs Gold Units according to the aforementioned exchange rates. The customs duties payable were then calculated based on the Customs Gold Units. What standard was used to determine the market price of the Customs Gold Unit? It was the daily rate posted by the Central Bank. How was the Customs Gold Unit rate derived? It was entirely calculated. The calculation method involved multiplying the pure gold content of the Customs Gold Unit by the London market price of pure gold per ounce, then dividing the result by the Shanghai exchange rate for British pounds. The result was the market price of the Customs Gold Unit.

Prohibition of Gold Coin Outflow

Shanghai is an international trading port and a central hub for the concentration of goods from the interior. The inflow and outflow of gold loans are also centered in Shanghai, although other ports exist, they are in the minority. The main reason is that Shanghai is a free market. In the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), gold was expensive and silver was cheap worldwide. At that time, Chinese gold coins flowed from the interior to Shanghai and then abroad. It was the most prosperous era. This was relevant to the national finances, so on May 15th of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), the government ordered an absolute ban on the export of gold coins. However, because the domestic gold price was lower than the overseas market, gold coin smuggling was rampant, and gold continued to flow out secretly, though in smaller quantities.

Reduction of Standard Gold Fineness

At the end of January of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the U.S. government reduced the fineness of the gold dollar, causing drastic changes in international currency parities. To prevent price fluctuations and to redefine the currency system, the Chinese National Government also reduced the fineness of standard gold in February of the same year. (From 978/1000 to 833.76/1000, i.e., the pure gold content of the new U.S. par value of 343.93 yuan, equivalent to 4.7165638 grams per standard gold bar weighing 5.657 grams, contains 833.76/1000 parts pure gold). However, while the new fineness of standard gold was established, it had not yet been minted. Therefore, Shanghai continued to use the old fineness of standard gold.

Suppressing Speculation in the Standard Gold Market

In January of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), the government ordered a crackdown on speculators in the standard gold market, as speculative transactions in standard gold were closely related to foreign exchange. Although the crackdown was ordered, it was ineffective. In September of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the Ministry of Finance suddenly promulgated Foreign Exchange Control Regulations, again cracking down on speculators. Only legal businesses with legitimate needs, contracts signed before September 8th, 1934, travel expenses, or private needs were allowed to engage in foreign exchange transactions. All new transactions had to be settled in cash and could no longer be settled in foreign exchange. All previous transactions were allowed to proceed according to the original contracts. Furthermore, the price of standard gold transactions had to conform to the daily rate announced by the Central Bank.

Changes in Standard Gold Settlement Prices

The settlement prices in the Shanghai gold market can be divided into four periods:

(1) The period before the Great War (pre-1914), when prices were settled in British pounds.

(2) The period after the Great War until the "September 18th Incident" (1931), when prices were settled in Japanese yen.

(3) From the "September 18th Incident" to September 8th, 1934, when prices were settled in U.S. dollars.

(4) After September 8th, 1934, when prices were settled in British gold. (After the settlement in British gold, the Central Bank controlled its management.)

After "August 13th" (1937), the financial authorities further strengthened gold coin management measures and stipulated specific regulations.

Methods for Exchanging Gold for Legal Tender

In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the National Government issued 500 million yuan in national salvation bonds, stipulating that they could be purchased with gold or legal tender. This was the government's initial method for collecting gold from the public. Subsequently, seven articles of measures for exchanging gold were promulgated, stipulating that the following handling fees should be given to those who exchanged gold for legal tender: (A) 3% for those under ten taels. (B) 4% for those ten taels or five taels or more. (C) 5% for those fifty taels or fifty taels or more. The foregoing three handling fees are paid by the Ministry of Finance. However, gold purchases of national salvation bonds, regardless of the amount, were subject to a 6% handling fee. If gold was handed over to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, or Farmers Bank of China as legal tender deposits, and the deposit term was one year or more, an additional weekly interest of 0.2% would be added to the original interest.

Monitoring the Acceptance of Gold by Silver Shops

Although the gold exchange was closed after "August 13th", money exchange businesses and silver shops continued to operate as usual. At that time, the foreign exchange black market shrank sharply, and the black market price of gold also rose accordingly, causing speculators to become active again, and smuggling resumed. To prevent smuggling, the authorities promulgated measures for silver shops to accept gold in November of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), including the following four articles: (A) Silver shops are allowed to accept or sell gold only in the form of ornaments and are not allowed to accept or sell gold bars or gold nuggets. (B) The value of gold ornaments accepted by silver shops shall be based on the value jointly determined by the Central, Bank of China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, and shall not be arbitrarily raised or lowered. (C) If the above two provisions are violated, once verified, the shop shall be suspended from business, and all ornaments or gold in the store shall be forcibly sold to the Central Bank in exchange for legal tender. (D) Those who specialize in the acquisition and sale of mineral gold or placer gold shall contact the Central Bank and sell all the acquired placer gold to the Central Bank. Apart from this, people are still allowed to freely buy and sell ornaments to silver shops.

Restricting Gold Exports

The foreign exchange black market shrank drastically, differing greatly from the rate posted by the Central Bank, resulting in a surge of unscrupulous merchants. Seeing that the large outflow of gold was detrimental to the national financial resources, the Ministry of Finance, in December of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), stipulated a ban on the private transportation of gold for export or to occupied areas. If violators were found, all of their gold would be confiscated. However, travelers carrying gold ornaments abroad or to occupied areas were allowed to do so according to the following provisions: (1) Gold ornaments refer to objects made entirely of metal in the shape of ornaments. (2) The gold ornaments are indeed for the traveler's current attire or preparation. (3) The total amount of pure gold contained in the new gold ornaments shall not exceed 37.7994 grams. In addition, to prevent financial institutions from using the name of depositing reserves by fraudulently obtaining coupons, and secretly purchasing gold and silver in the interior to profit, the Ministry of Finance issued a telegram in January of this year to the silver and money industry associations prohibiting the private purchase of gold and silver. If violators were found, the Ministry of Finance would, according to the circumstances, forcibly purchase or dispose of the gold and silver they purchased.

Prohibiting the Pledge of Gold

Recently, the financial authorities announced measures to crack down on the pledging of gold by financial and pawn industries, including the following six points: (1) After the implementation of these measures, financial institutions (silver and money firms) and pawn shops in various places shall not pledge gold coins, gold bullion, utensils, or raw gold. (2) For the gold pledged by financial institutions and pawn shops in various places before the implementation of these measures, a detailed list should be filled out in accordance with the prescribed form after the promulgation of these measures, and reported truthfully by household to the local government and the local, or nearby, Central, Bank of China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, or their entrusted exchange agencies for verification. If there are no Four Banks in the nearby area, a special report shall be submitted to the local government for verification, without any concealment. (3) For the gold pledged by financial institutions and pawn shops in various places before the implementation of these measures, those who are unable to redeem it when the pledge period expires and are required to sell it should not sell it freely, but should be sent by the financial institutions and pawn shops to the local or nearest Four Banks, or other entrusted exchange agencies, for exchange into legal tender. In addition to the exchange price they are entitled to, they may also enjoy the benefits of receiving statutory handling fees and special bonuses. (4) For the gold pledged before the implementation of these measures, those whose pure gold content is within one tael (37.7994 grams) of Customs Gold Unit are allowed to be redeemed by the original pledgor. (5) For the gold pledged before the implementation of these measures, if the pure gold content exceeds one tael of Customs Gold Unit, the portion exceeding one tael of Customs Gold Unit shall be jointly inspected by the financial institutions and pawn shops receiving the pledge and the owner of the goods, and a person shall be dispatched to hold it and go to the local or nearby gold and silver exchange agency to exchange it into legal tender. In addition to the original pledge receiver collecting the principal and interest receivable, the remaining exchange price, handling fees, and special bonuses shall still be received by the original pledgor. (6) If financial institutions and pawn shops violate the provisions of the aforementioned Articles 1, 2, 3, and 5, and are found or reported to be true, the local authorities shall impose a fine of ten times to fifty times the original price on those who privately pledge, conceal, or privately sell or deliver the items, and recover the price of the gold confiscated in accordance with these measures, and the price of the confiscated items, and give 50% of the proceeds to the discoverer and the informant as a reward, and 50% shall be handed over to the national treasury. (7) If financial institutions and pawn shops violate these measures and are punished three times, and there are still violations, the local government shall report to the highest competent government agency to order them to suspend business. (8) The local governments and the Four Banks' exchange agencies shall immediately check and register one by one according to the numbers listed after the financial institutions and pawn shops report the pledged gold, and may investigate the registration of the account books of each industry. After completing the registration, they shall prepare a report and submit it to the Ministry of Finance for verification, but no later than one month after the promulgation of these measures. If there are any changes in the original registration situation, such as exchange or redemption, it shall be registered at any time. The local government agencies shall report the cases of execution of penalties in accordance with these measures to the competent government agency at any time for submission to the Ministry for verification. (9) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

In summary, the process of the gold coin management methods implemented by the authorities can be divided into two stages: The first stage, before "August 13th", was to control the gold-silver ratio; the second stage was the wartime concentration of gold coins. The purpose of the first stage was to stabilize the financial market; the purpose of the second stage was to strengthen foreign exchange reserves and consolidate the legal tender as an economic barrier in wartime.

### The True Meaning of the "Yen Bloc"

— Li Baojiang

In recent years, the Japanese have meticulously planned to create a Yen Bloc with Japan as the center. Therefore, they have spared no effort to disrupt Chinese finances, establishing "Joint Reserve" and "China Development" in North and Central China and issuing counterfeit banknotes. They have also repeatedly demanded the surrender of the silver stored in the British and French concessions in Tianjin. They have used every conceivable conspiracy, but to this day, they have not achieved their desired goals, and the so-called Yen Bloc is fragmented, relying solely on bayonets. However, Japan still intends to struggle to the end. John Ahlers, a reporter for the Millard's Review, pointed out that their intention is to eradicate foreign interests in China, which can be said to be a pertinent judgment.

The reason why the Sterling Bloc succeeded is that, in terms of its nature, it is fundamentally an organization containing automaticity. All members of the bloc are independent currencies, and the British colonies have no mandatory requirement to join. For example, although Canada is a British territory, its currency is not connected to the British pound; on the contrary, it is linked to the neighboring U.S. dollar. Therefore, participants in the Sterling Bloc organization include not only the currencies of various British territories, but also legal tenders circulating in other countries. Therefore, independent countries such as Norway, Sweden, France, and China are all members of the Sterling Bloc. Whether the currency of such countries should be closely linked to the British pound can be decided at any time at their own discretion. In addition, the formation of the Sterling Bloc is by no means related to trade control or foreign exchange control. This is a special feature of the Sterling Bloc. However, the situation of the so-called Yen Bloc is completely different. Its first feature is that the organization of the bloc is fundamentally limited to the areas controlled by the Japanese military. The so-called participants are all forcibly coerced. As for whether they should be linked to the Japanese yen, they have no autonomy at all. Secondly, the currencies within the so-called Yen Bloc are not only unable to be called free currencies, but their common value has no real basis at all. They are simply enforced by bayonets. For example, the counterfeit yuan of Manchukuo, the Korean won of Korea, and the counterfeit banknotes of "North China" and "Joint Reserve" falsely claim to be linked to the Japanese yen at par. At the same time, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen linked to the U.S. dollar is 100 yen equal to 23.45 U.S. dollars. Therefore, theoretically, the legal price of the above-mentioned "currencies" is also 100 yuan equal to 23.45 U.S. dollars. In reality, this exchange rate is only nominal and not real, because in fact, only the Japanese yen can barely be exchanged for currencies other than the Yen Bloc. As for other "currencies", even Japanese yen cannot be purchased. Moreover, as far as the Japanese yen is concerned, because a large number of Japanese banknotes are flooding Tianjin and Shanghai, its exchange rate in the Shanghai black market is less than 10 U.S. dollars per 100 yuan, and no one welcomes it. Even Japanese businessmen do not want it because they cannot take it back to their country.

Japanese soldiers superstitiously believe that military force is omnipotent, thinking that military force can conquer and subdue everything. However, they do not know that the issuing agency of a currency must be legal, and only legality can gain people's trust. Failing that, the issuance must have substantial reserves. However, few of the currencies in the "Yen Bloc" meet these conditions. For example, the counterfeit banknotes in North and Central China are even more disorganized. Even as far as the Japanese yen itself is concerned, its gold reserves have been completely depleted, and the amount of issuance has expanded indefinitely. No wonder the black market is rampant in the country, and the price has been falling abroad. The Japanese yen itself is already overwhelmed, let alone taking care of the counterfeit banknotes it created. The more counterfeit banknotes there are, the more the exchange rate of the Japanese yen tends to fall.

So why is Japan still actively expanding the Yen Bloc? Because Japan has no other tools to disguise its plunder of materials except by using the "Yen Bloc". We only need to observe the technical methods of the Yen Bloc to understand. Taking Manchukuo as an example, the banknotes issued by the "Central Bank" of Manchukuo are linked to the Japanese yen. At the same time, both Japan and "Manchukuo" have implemented strict foreign exchange controls, strictly restricting the purchase of foreign goods, services, and securities. There is also a special measure for the two sides to settle the international balance of payments deficit. Whenever Japan has a deficit with Manchukuo in terms of international balance of payments, it does not export gold to settle it, but instead uses Bank of Japan banknotes for compensation. However, these banknotes are not actually shipped out, but are deposited in the Bank of Japan in the name of the "Central Bank" of Manchukuo. At the same time, according to the Currency Law promulgated by Manchukuo in 1933, it is stipulated that the "Central Bank" can use real foreign currency as gold reserves for issuance. Therefore, the Japanese yen existing in the Bank of Japan is used as the issuance reserve of Manchukuo banknotes. As a result, the "international" balance of payments between Japan and Manchukuo can be balanced by this method, and Japan can also purchase raw materials, services, and securities from Manchukuo as much as possible without worrying about exporting gold to settle the accounts. As for the Japanese yen in "North China", although it has a group relationship with the counterfeit banknotes of "Joint Reserve" since the establishment of "Joint Reserve", the status of legal tender has always been strong, making it impossible for the counterfeit banknotes to gain the trust of the people. Therefore, although "foreign exchange control" has also been implemented, "North China" has not occupied a strong position in the "Yen Bloc".

In summary, it can be seen that after the formation of the "Yen Bloc", the exchange rate between the two sides can be stabilized, reducing all unexpected losses caused by exchange rate fluctuations, and enabling commercial transactions between the two sides to be increased due to the consistency of currency value. Furthermore, the intention of Japan to organize the Yen Bloc is to use the method of controlling foreign exchange to purchase raw materials that Japan needs to purchase from foreign countries as much as possible in Manchukuo and "North China"; and to completely replace the foreign goods needed to be sold in the markets of Manchukuo and "North China" with Japanese goods. In this way, it is no wonder that Japan currently accounts for 70% of the total foreign trade in Manchukuo and North China. Therefore, in a nutshell, the purpose of organizing the "Yen Bloc" is to monopolize the group market and raw materials and eliminate all foreign economic interests in China.

### The Past Week

— Yiquan

Rising Cost of Living

The worker cost of living index in this city reached 30.06 in December of last year, an increase of 19.5% compared to November of last year. In the classified index, all items increased, especially food and fuel. Beginning this year, we hoped that various prices would fall; however, since New Year's Day, there have been many cases of commodities increasing prices in newspapers. If prices only rise and do not fall, the result will inevitably lead to people's lives being in difficulty, and there will be a major problem with social stability. As the purchasing power becomes weak, the market will only decline. In order to maintain social stability and the market in the midst of storms, the only way to go right now is to passively stabilize prices, starting with the three items of rice, oil, and briquettes; and actively find ways to transfer capital to the southwest, and vigorously implement thrift and promote large-scale consumer cooperation.

Labor-Management Discord

During the New Year's holiday, labor-management discord arose again due to the employer dismissing employees, and it is still at a stalemate. At this time and in this place, this kind of friction, needless to say, should be avoided as much as possible. It is hoped that the wise employers will be generous, take back their orders, and reinstate them. This is no less than providing relief to them, and they will certainly be grateful beyond words! In short, in this extraordinary period, labor-management coordination is an unchanging iron rule, because the progress of society is due to the harmony of the economic interests of the majority of society, not the conflict of the economic interests of the majority of society!

Levying Inheritance Tax

The National Government implemented the levying of inheritance tax starting on New Year's Day this year. The detailed regulations were announced on the 6th. Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated levying inheritance tax by the progressive method. The detailed rules announced this time have not yet been seen; however, the tax rates published in the news: starting with a tax of 1% on inheritances under 100,000 yuan, increasing to a tax of 50% on inheritances over 10 million yuan, the tax rate increases very rapidly from 2 million yuan and above. This is in accordance with Mr. Sun's inheritance tax proposal. The purpose of the government's levying of income tax and inheritance tax is nothing more than to develop the national economy with tax revenue and to carry out various undertakings that are of economic benefit to the majority. Especially in wartime, increasing taxes and raising debts are necessary means of wartime finance. Therefore, this decision to levy inheritance tax does have its far-reaching significance. As for the people themselves, there are also great benefits, because the million-dollar assets of many rich people often create unpromising descendants. After the implementation of micro-collection, it can reduce the dependence of wealthy children and encourage them to make progress. Therefore, levying inheritance tax is beneficial to both the country and oneself.

Rapid Progress in Agriculture and Industry

The youth chemical technicians in Sichuan Province have successfully researched the extraction of pure stearic acid from indigenous oil raw materials. After its production in the coming spring, it should be able to reduce a lot of leakage every year. Soon, Sichuan Province once founded a science and technology sugar factory, and its products can not only be self-sufficient, but also supply other provinces. As for agriculture, the northwest and southwest provinces have all been scientifically cultivated, and the harvest last year increased greatly. Recently, the Four Banks' office established a rural lending department, specializing in rural investment. Judging from these points alone, it can be seen that the economic construction in the interior is showing a leap forward under the government's encouragement.

Commercial News

### Finance: The Gold Market is Mediocre

Spot Gold: Yesterday's spot gold black market situation was extremely calm due to the holiday. No trading was heard from morning to noon. It is said that the price also changed little, remaining similar to the closing price of 4,110 yuan on the previous day.

Gold Ornaments: The exchange rate for gold jewelry in silverware shops has also not changed. Da Tong Heng and Xin Tong Heng still hung the original price of 415 yuan, with the purchase price reduced by 15 yuan.

### Food: Rice Supply is Growing

The Price of Rice Continued to Drop by Half a Yuan; Common Indica Rice Fell to the Limit Price

Since the rice market rebounded weakly the previous day, yesterday, no less than 1,000 to 2,000 packages of early and late indica rice and Qing Si thin rice transferred from Hongkou to the interior South Gang Gang, and imported rice also continued to arrive, causing people in the market to become more lax. Although it was a weekday, banks and warehouses rarely showed samples. However, because general merchants and vendors saw that the market was already tired and feared a large loss, they rushed to sell, and the number of people throwing goods was quite large. General importers also had the same perspective and were unwilling to import more. Therefore, except for some sporadic purchases from local shops, there were no large-scale sales. Therefore, the market was tired from the opening of the market in the morning until the close of the market. All goods, whether indica, glutinous rice, or domestic and foreign types, fell by more than half a yuan compared with the previous market. It is estimated that the opening price of Su Tong high-quality indica rice was 39 yuan, the medium and secondary indica rice was only around 37 yuan, and the price of Chang Gang white indica rice also fell by the limit of half a yuan, to 39.5 yuan. High-quality South Gang early and late indica rice was 36.35 yuan, and the medium and secondary rice was only 35.78 yuan. Although the special thin rice was shouted at 38 yuan, it was not seen to be transacted, and the transaction was only 37.78 yuan to 37.5 yuan. The prices of other goods are detailed in the market price column.

### Sugar Market: Qing Sugar Firm Prices Are Tight Again

Yesterday, the sugar market saw ups and downs. The Association's divided prices: spot goods 24 thick white, 58.4 yuan in the local warehouse, a small drop of 0.1 yuan, 58.5 yuan for new arrivals in foreign warehouses, a small drop of 0.5 yuan, 58.2 yuan for old goods, a small drop of 0.3 yuan, and later 58 yuan. Transshipment goods were 48 yuan. Taikoo grade A refined white sugar rose slightly for the top grade, and the bottom grade was stable. B grade from the East Warehouse was 59 yuan, 59.3 yuan from the West Warehouse, CW grade was 59 yuan, CX grade was 58.8 yuan, DY grade was 58.5 yuan, 58 yuan from the East Warehouse, HX grade was 57.5 yuan, 58 yuan from the West Warehouse, H grade raw red sugar was 43.5 yuan, a small drop of 0.5 yuan, Dutch red MP grade was 46 yuan, WA grade was 45.5 yuan, local refined white sugar was a small drop of 0.5 yuan, Zhen Ji No. 1 was 58 yuan, and local rock sugar remained unchanged. Guo Tang had Xing Hua Gang start opening with Hua Qing at 50 packages, the price was 40 yuan in cash. Zhangzhou Qing opened at 44 yuan, but because there was not much stock in the market, and the new goods were in short supply, the market situation tightened again. Yesterday, all the firms were still calling 45 yuan. It is said that the new Qing sugar has been transported from Xinjiang by Xinjiang Wheel, whether it is true or not, we will wait for the sample to confirm.

### Seafood, Starch and Sago, Market Continues to Advance

Starch: Recently, due to the scarcity of supply and the increase in production costs, the market continues to be favorable. Currently, Flying Unicorn brand is selling for $45, 3X for $44, KG for $44, Human Gun for $42, and Double A for $38, each rising by $5 compared to the previous market. It is noted that the stock of lower-grade goods in this area has been exhausted.

Sago: Due to the shortage of goods, sales are not bad. Currently, large-grain sago is priced at $55 and small-grain at $60, making it quite profitable.

Clothing, Food, Housing and Transportation

### Initial Experiences with Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation in Kunming

— Xiaowei

For people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces who are new to Kunming, there are initially four difficulties: finding housing, finding food, finding clothing, and getting around. From January to now, the degree of difficulty has become even more profound, especially the problem of "eating," which everyone ponders day and night without being able to solve it. This is the case for both those who work with their minds and those who work with their hands. Rice prices have soared, jumping from over $30 to over $70 per dan (a unit of dry measure). Vegetables have risen from 5 cents a catty to 50 cents a catty. Pork has risen from 20 cents a catty to $1.20 a catty. Charcoal has risen from 4 cents a catty to 18 cents a catty. Table salt has risen from 18 cents a catty to 60 cents a catty. Soy sauce has risen from 14 cents a catty to 60 cents a catty. Vegetable oil has risen from 28 cents a catty to $1.20 a catty. Matches have risen from 20 cents to $1 per pack. Eating a meal, living a day, feels like sending entire rolls of banknotes into your stomach. A month of hard work is not enough to satisfy your hunger. This standard of living is truly "unprecedented," but who has made us this way?

Speaking of clothing, not to mention anything else, just consider blue cloth jackets. Ordinary blue cloth used to cost 16 cents a foot, but now it costs 70 cents a foot. Homespun cloth used to cost $2 per bolt, but now it costs $10 per bolt. Men's leather shoes that used to cost $7 now cost more than $50. Women's leather shoes that used to cost $6 now cost more than $40. Cloth shoes that used to cost over $1 now cost over $3. Cotton that used to cost 80 cents per catty now costs $3.80. Wool socks that used to cost 60 cents a pair now cost $3. Therefore, for salaried people, if they want to make clothes relying on their salary, apart from what they bring with them, they will inevitably be "scantily clad."

As for housing, the first thing to do upon arriving in Kunming is to find a house, but it is quite difficult for people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to find housing. Unless they have acquaintances to introduce them through connections, otherwise you need to pay a large deposit, as if the money is taken and never returned. The houses are either with broken windows or dirt floors. Most of the houses still do not have electric lights, and they leak when it rains. Fortunately, the heavens protect us, and the rainy season has passed; otherwise, a head-on blow to newcomers would scare them back home, wouldn't it? One night it happened to rain, and a large patch on my pillow was wet. I even thought I was crying in my dream.

The problem of transportation is even more different from Shanghai, where there are always buses and trams. There are no asphalt roads here, all paved with stones. Cleanliness is acceptable, but it is not very flat. Wearing leather shoes makes it even more noticeable. There are many ox carts on the road, used to transport building materials, rice, etc. They are mostly in groups, filling the streets with cattle. The sound of two wooden wheels rolling on the stones is a unique flavor. Rickshaws are too expensive to ride, costing at least 30 cents, so most people "walk as transport." Zhengyi Road is the most lively, known as "Kunming's Nanjing Road." Jinbi Road and Huguo Road are also good. The remaining mountain roads are impassable after rain. One water pool after another is connected. It really brings a sigh of "can't travel, older brother." Civilization Street has the most clothing stores, just like Shilu in Shanghai. The ivory rings on Wenmiao Street are also rarely seen in Shanghai. What cannot be denied is that the climate here is truly excellent. The sunshine shines warmly in the breeze. Throughout the year, people cycle through single layers, lined layers, and padded layers. It is feared that a second place cannot be found in the entire country, right? Friends, you are welcome to come!

### One Lesson Learned from Experience

— Xinyong

When making Western suits, the material should be paid attention to first. Do not choose one that is easily curled, folded, or wrinkled. Otherwise, it is not only extremely unsightly in appearance, but also very easily damaged.

When dining at various restaurants, it is best to bring your own wine. Also, do not discard empty bottles, but return them to the original liquor store to claim a reasonable price.

Recently, all restaurants also offer a "snacks" section, the purpose of which is to be economical for customers, so diners do not need to tip extra.

When purchasing clothing, it is always reliable to rely on stores with old brands and good products. Otherwise, although it may be cheap for a while, you will regret it endlessly later.

Before making new clothes, it is best to first have the tailor measure the exact amount of material needed, and then purchase it from the store. Then, there will definitely be no shortage of material.

Patronize the shoe stores on Avenue Joffre; most of them give away a box of shoe polish.

The items inside Shanghai's various hotels, especially food, are several times more expensive compared to outside. Therefore, those who book rooms, if they want to eat and drink lavishly inside the hotel, the bill that comes out later may very well have "food" as the top expense.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Huaying

This is the beginning of the year. Generally, an organized family must establish a budget, listing the prescribed income and expenses for the year clearly, so that they can know the economic situation for the year, save where possible, and avoid exceeding the budget. However, I must warn housewives that when listing the expenses for two vegetarian dishes under the daily meal items, you can no longer use the index from a year ago, listing 60 or 70 cents, but must write at least one dollar; otherwise, it will definitely exceed the budget. Haven't you seen how quickly prices have soared in recent months? Even the most common tofu costs at least 5 cents. Buying 30 to 40 cents worth of pork can only be cut into shredded pork, adding more complementary ingredients to barely fill two bowls. If you want to cut the meat into whole pieces, have a bowl of braised pork or Dongpo pork, forget about it. But then again, eating is endless. As long as you follow my menu and let housewives who know how to calculate properly allocate it well, it is still in line with economic conditions.

Monday

Stir-fried shredded meat with dried bean curd sheets, braised salted fish with tofu, braised radish slices, pickled mustard greens with soybean sprouts

Tuesday

Curry beef slices, jellyfish and bluefish slices, stir-fried bok choy, dried tofu strips with water celery

Wednesday

Salted pork and tofu soup, stir-fried pea seedlings with small shrimp, braised cabbage, pickled mustard greens with sprouted beans

Saturday

Onion beef strips, cellophane noodles with bighead carp head, stir-fried tatsoi, scallion oil radish shreds

Sunday

Roast mutton, baked seabream, stir-fried vegetables, mung bean sprouts

### This Year's Clothing, Food, Housing and Transportation

— Zhang Zhenshan

A new year begins, and everything is renewed! The 29th year of the Republic of China has arrived happily. The living dynamics of people at all levels have thus unfolded with new activity. Although the enjoyment of clothing, food, housing, and transportation differs in quality, their image is consistent. Without the difference between rich and poor, everyone expresses a kind of vigorous new vitality from the needs of their life psychology. All customs control the thoughts in our minds; all entertainment eliminates the hard work of past days. At the same time, due to the enlightenment of time, we must inevitably make this year's "life plan" at the moment of this year's renewal.

Without making empty hopes and fantasies, we should take out our own wisdom, confidence, and perseverance this year to adapt to the living environment. In an era of soaring prices, it is certainly quite difficult to achieve a balance between production and consumption in the four parts of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, but it is not absolutely impossible. In terms of clothing: We must have twelve points of determination and autonomy to implement the "old clothing and homespun cloth movement," and not "bite off more than we can chew." Assuming that hoarding and speculation of yarn and cotton will continue as in the past this year, and every thread and filament will be very expensive, we must abandon the empty praise of good appearance and resolutely wear old clothes as new clothes, whether they have been discarded by ourselves or bought from old clothes stalls, without worrying about the distorted social concept of "only valuing clothes and not people." We only need them to be suitable and economical. If we have to make new ones, we will use pure homespun cloth. Especially this year—all provinces and cities across the country are following the leader's instructions that in the second phase of the war of resistance, the economy is more important than military affairs. We are implementing the economic war of resistance movement starting from this very moment. We should pay more attention to the fact that everything we wear is domestic.

In terms of food: The most threatening thing after the price of the main food—rice—has risen is the middle and lower class urban population. In addition to expecting the authorities in the concessions to stabilize prices, we must of course find ways to remedy the situation ourselves. The so-called remedy is obviously to promote the movement of wheat-based foods as the first priority. Although flour prices are also linked to rice and are similarly expensive, because its consumption is less than rice, it is still more economical. In addition, sweet potatoes, taro, corn, and soybean flour can be used as auxiliary foods. In the past few months, my personal experience can be said to be quite satisfactory.

The crowded state of housing in Shanghai loosened in the second half of last year because the cost of living exceeded the standard. This natural dispersion seems to have only alleviated the trouble of unequal supply and demand on the surface, but in fact, the people who live here have gained convenience in terms of savings. Unlike before, moving was absolutely impossible. Now you can change to smaller and lower-cost spaces. For example, if you live in a wing room, you can plan to move to a garret; if you live in a garret, you can move to a kitchen lean-to.

Transportation in Shanghai, such as trams and buses, has repeatedly increased in price, and rickshaws have also invisibly raised their prices. Taxis are even more out of the question. However, although prices have risen, people who are unwilling to waste their legs are not greatly affected. Therefore, we should strengthen the "walking movement" even more this year, both saving money and exercising our leg strength, and indirectly improving our health. Given the narrow living space of the isolated island, there is really no reason to take a car for every step, right?

What has been said above all seems to be passive, a last resort. But the proactive way is only to go to the interior. However, because the source of livelihood is here, and because of the skills we possess and other issues, there are certainly many people who find it difficult to go to the interior, so I offer this short article to my compatriots living on the isolated island, instead of "Happy New Year."

### Talking About Hats

— Shen Xishen

As the height of winter approaches, in addition to having to add clothes to our bodies, we must also wear a hat on our heads to ward off the cold, especially when going out. The north wind is strong, and the cold air is piercing. If we don't wear a hat, we may feel even colder!

The most common hats in our country are probably melon-cap small caps and felt hats. However, in recent years, people in general big cities have no longer liked to wear melon-cap small caps and have replaced them with felt hats. Of course, in the inland provinces, there are still more people wearing melon-cap small caps. In all fairness, melon-cap small caps are not worth promoting. Their shape and color are not elegant, and wearing them makes you feel old and dull, so there is a great need for improvement! And the most suitable hat is probably the felt hat. Wearing it makes you feel generous and impressive. And the felt hat has a brim, which can reduce the force of wind and sand blowing into the eyes. Therefore, the sales of felt hats are increasing day by day, making them the most ideal hat for modern people. Fortunately, Chinese people can now make felt hats themselves, without relying on foreign countries. Otherwise, with the current sharp contraction of foreign exchange, a imported felt hat would not be available for less than thirty or forty dollars, which is something that we salaried people can't afford!

In addition to warding off the cold, hats have various other uses; such as using straw hats to shade the sun in summer, farmers must wear palm-fiber hats when farming to avoid sunlight, aviation personnel must wear flight caps to facilitate driving, female nurses in hospitals often wear a white hat to show cleanliness, soldiers must wear steel helmets when fighting to prevent bullets from hitting their heads. The north requires wearing fur hats because of the severe cold climate. Everything varies depending on the matter and the time, and hats must fulfill their responsibility of protecting people's heads, so of course they are worthy of our praise.

### Fast Boats

— Wang Yongtao

Pre-war Ningbo also had fast boats, although not as ubiquitous as after the war. Because traffic was extremely convenient at that time, there were very few passengers. But it was different after the war; transportation networks such as highways and railways were destroyed, so villagers had no choice but to take fast boats to the city. Therefore, every town had traces of them, and more than just one!

The boat body is very small, and a boat can only accommodate thirty or forty people. Before sailing, they first notify by beating a small gong. The first time seems to be to tell you to prepare, the second time seems to be to urge you to leave, and after the third beat, they are about to set sail. At this time, the boatmen work very hard, pulling the ropes and rowing, propelling the small boat quite nimbly. The so-called fast boat can be said to be worthy of the name!

Although the boat is very fast, it takes one or two hours to travel twenty or thirty li, so passengers often get lonely and doze off. To remedy this shortcoming, there is a blind man on each boat who sings the news, but after singing it once, he also asks the passengers for money.

The boat fare is very cheap. The entire trip of twenty or thirty li costs only two dimes, and if you disembark in the middle, then one dime is enough.

Spring and Autumn

### Two Family Letters

— Ji Fufang

These two family letters are a microcosm of the lives of most people in this city.

Yesterday afternoon, I went to the post office to remit some money. I walked into that green house and saw that the counter was crowded with people, and it was not easy to get forward. Unwilling to wait in the crowd, I retreated and wandered around near the post office.

At the corner of the street, there was a newspaper stand, so I went up and bought a small newspaper and stayed there, flipping through the magazines on display at will. But I also found that there was a "writing letters for others" stall at the small alley entrance to the left. I knew this was unique to the vicinity of the post office. There sat an old man, idle and drowsy, with hazy eyes. Before long, a man in his thirties came. I asked the old man to write a letter. The old man dragged out an orange and invited him to sit aside, took out pen, ink, paper, and inkstone, and asked him how he wanted to write.

The man first told him the general idea:

"Write to my son in my tone. His name is Jinfu. First, ask if the family is well... How is grandma's health?... Write like this: I am also well in Shanghai. Don't worry. The business in the store is very good, but our old steward's salary has not been increased. Now, nothing in Shanghai is not rising in price. Rice sells for forty dollars a dan. My expenses are half as much again as before... In the future, I won't have much money to send back. The family must work for others..."

The old man nodded and wrote as he said. The man frowned and pondered for a long time, then said to the old man:

"Sir, add a sentence to the end of the letter, which is that we are short of money for the New Year, so we have to go to Jinfu's uncle's house to borrow some..."

The old man wielded his brush quickly. The man sat by the stall, staring at the letter blankly. But I realized that I had been staying at the newspaper stand for too long and couldn't "sponge" for too long, so I had to return to the post office.

In the evening, my neighbor Jinsheng's mother brought a letter and asked me to look at it, saying that Jinsheng had written it to his grandfather, and she was afraid there was something wrong with it. She asked me to see if there were any mistakes.

"...Now things are expensive in Shanghai. Rice sells for forty dollars a dan, and oil costs one dollar a catty... The rent has also increased, adding up to twenty-eight dollars. The sub-landlord is still grumbling... Now the family already owes some debts. Mother says please find a way to send more money back... If it's really impossible, Mother wants to ask Mr. Wang to introduce me to learn a trade, and the family can save some expenses..."

Although it was written by a child, it was entirely in his mother's tone, revealing the suffering of daily life on paper.

After she left, I felt very unhappy. Inadvertently, I read two pairs of unsent family letters. Each letter seemed to contain blood and tears, hiding unspeakable suffering. At the same time, in my imagination, I also imagined the scene when these two letters arrived in the hands of the recipients. One is a father who has gone out to make a living for the sake of his family, but does not have enough money to send home. How disappointed and painful will his wife and children be when they read this letter? One is a lonely person far away from his family, drifting elsewhere. After receiving the letter, he learns that his wife and children are being whipped by the whip of life. How will he hesitate, worry, and try to help?

These two family letters are a microcosm of the lives of most people in this city.

Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Enjoying the Moon, Forming a Family; Planting Jade and Conceiving Pearls, Skilled in Pregnancy

Zhu Airen said, "Maybe she'll be at home on Sunday?" Tang Huizhen said, "That's hard to say! The two times she came to my place were both on Sundays. Maybe she goes out on Sundays instead. Because her husband doesn't like to go out much. Except for seeing a doctor, he stays locked up in his research room and laboratory all day long. Sister Peifen wants him to come out, saying that he is not healthy this way. But he is truly a scholar. He doesn't even recognize the roads in Shanghai. He is also afraid of all social interactions. He doesn't have many friends either, and all his friends are scholars like him. He doesn't know how to drive a car either. Peifen drives the car when they go out. Last time they came to my place, she first sent him to his scholar friend's house, and then came to my place. I said, 'Why didn't you come with him?' She said, 'He's not interested in what we talk about. We naturally talk about all sorts of trivial things that he can't stand listening to. It's better to send him to friends who are on the same wavelength.' But after a while, she has to pick him up in the car. Peifen said, 'If I don't pick him up, he'll stay at his friend's house and not come back.' I said, 'You're exaggerating too much. He's not a child.' But she said it was true. But he is a top-notch bacteriologist. Hasn't he published several famous books that medical scientists regard as the standard?' If you want to visit her, I'll give her a call first to ask if she's not going out. If she isn't, we'll go visit her." Tang Huizhen knew Yu Peifen's phone number. She picked up the receiver, dialed the dial, and called directly to Yu Peifen's house in Jiangwan. Because Shanghai's telephones are now unified with only one agency, there is no need to transfer. The other party replied that Doctor Yu and Teacher Xia were both out and instructed not to come back for dinner. They were afraid they wouldn't be back until evening. Tang Huizhen put down the receiver and said, "Isn't that so? Luckily, I made a call first. Otherwise, it would have been a wasted trip. Luckily, you have a few days to spare. We can go tomorrow or the day after." That day, Tang Huizhen kept Zhu Airen at home for lunch. The old classmates talked and talked, and were very happy. Because they had studied together in the United States, and now they have returned to China, each has taken up her profession, and there are fewer opportunities to meet. Everyone inevitably gradually talked about medicine. Tang Huizhen is a female specialist, and Zhu Airen works at a women and children's hospital, especially studying obstetrics. They discussed how to prevent pregnant women from having difficult births? How to ensure that pregnant women do not experience any pain during childbirth? Finally, they talked about the artificial pregnancy methods invented in various European and American countries. (224)

### Alarming Numbers

— Ren

Comparing the disappearance of Shanghai's dance halls with the joyful scenes of last Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, the "isolated island" of these two years seems to have restored the peace of pre-war times; but this superficial prosperity cannot hide the internal decay. Those who are celebrating are just dancing on thin ice, their foundations are so fragile that they will soon collapse!

On the second day after this newspaper was suspended, two alarming reports uncovered the outer garment of this prosperity, revealing the internal rags of the "isolated island." One is that the number of prisoners held in the Ward Road prison has reached 8,300, breaking the record of previous years; the other is the report from Pushan Villa that the number of exposed corpses buried last year reached 11,075. These two alarming numbers are in stark contrast to the fifteen dollars per course of food, dividing the boundary line between the outer shape and the inner layer of the "isolated island."

Naturally, before the war, the West Prison on Ward Road was also the world's largest house of reflection, and Pushan Villa was also doing the charitable work of burying exposed corpses year after year; but are the current "breaking of previous year's records" and "insufficient coffins" accidental? If we are not forgetful, we can effortlessly cite many examples to confirm the cause of this "record." Please listen: Because life is unbearable, a passerby's wallet is robbed, voluntarily going to jail to eat "comfortable rice"; groups of men, women, old, and young, fearless of police whips and capture, break into rice stores to grab rice; a family of five, unable to make a living, kills their wives and children with their own hands; the hospital publishes notices, waiving all medical expenses, and asking the parents of sick children to go to the hospital to take their children back,... Aren't these bloody facts enough to expose the beautiful outer garment of the "isolated island"?

However, the general short-sighted people are content with the current comfort, living a life of drunken stupor; the insane are even more fueling the flames, hoarding and speculating, manipulating, causing all prices to exceed more than twice those before the war. Endless appeals may even be counterproductive to their "victorious" glory (?)

The year 1940 has descended upon the "isolated island," bringing us such precious news. Perhaps by the time the fourth New Year arrives, everything will change its face. In that case, even if they are selfish and self-interested, they should also plan for their personal foundation. This about-to-collapse ice layer will bring you tragic consequences.

In yesterday's newspaper, we saw two welcome news items: the Special District Citizens' Federation has requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to suppress commodity prices, and the price equalization committee will begin to handle price equalization. If these two positive and negative measures can be effectively implemented, they can also allow the general public and the unemployed to breathe a little easier. As for making those who have jobs enjoy their work, we also hope that employers will be a little more accommodating and not provoke terrible disputes.

This new year has brought new hope. Everyone should look further ahead, look at these alarming numbers, and extend a hand of sympathy to help the masses; and it is also for yourselves!
