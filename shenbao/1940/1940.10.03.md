### US President Issues Proclamation: Expanding Scope of Embargo Against Japan, Restricting Export of Military Equipment and Supplies, Philippine Abaca Also Included

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday further restricted the export of military supplies. The President's order stipulates that military searchlights, aerial cameras, and other military equipment and supplies are subject to export registration controls. At the same time, official personnel also stated that consideration is recently being given here to imposing an embargo on the Philippines to Japan. This measure may be decided by Congress or requested by the Federal Government to establish an export control method similar to that of the United States. The purpose of this plan is to intensify the US embargo on Japan in retaliation for Japan's alliance with the Axis powers. Defense experts here further stated that the export of abaca to Japan must be reconsidered. They claimed that the ban on the shipment of military supplies to Japan must include abaca from the Philippines. During a press conference, someone asked if a quantity of American steel was being smuggled from the Philippines to Japan. Secretary of State Hull replied that he had not previously paid attention to this matter. He also stated that he would be very willing to inquire about this at any time in the future. Hull also said that he had not heard of Japan purchasing scrap iron from Mexico to replace the supply it used to obtain from the United States. Hull refused to comment on the new Goldwater Bill proposed by government personnel. This bill relaxes restrictions on US loans to Britain, thereby allowing the United States to obtain naval and air force bases in the Pacific. The bill was submitted to Congress on Monday by its author, William Goldwater, a Democratic Senator from Utah. Hull stated that the Goldwater Bill has not yet been submitted to various government departments for comments, but he expressed his willingness to start soliciting comments from all parties on the bill within days. Currently, the government is unable to express its attitude towards the Goldwater Bill, but the bill will be debated in Congress this week. (2nd Associated Press)

Washington - Some isolationists here admit that it is only a matter of time before the United States enters the war. An observer told foreign reporters that if you are right, the United States will enter the war. The people clearly want to enter the war. There is no need to hide the facts. What we are preparing for now is war, not peace. The sooner we abandon the illusion of arming ourselves based on peace and actively make war efforts, the more beneficial it will be to us. German sources with inside information openly stated to Americans that there are three reasons for Germany's signing of the Tripartite Pact: (1) The realization that the European war will be a long-term war; (2) The trend for President Roosevelt to be re-elected; (3) The hope that Japan's joining the Axis powers will keep the United States out of the war. According to diplomatic circles, the bait used by Germany to lure Japan into signing the Tripartite Pact was to allow Japan to seize and retain the land east of India. (2nd Reuters)

London - The Swedish capital's Social Democratic newspaper stated that Germany and Italy's declaration of war against the United States in the current situation of aerial and naval warfare will not help Japan. However, the United States' joining the war on the British side, and Japan's subsequent declaration of war against the United States, will be a crisis for Japan. What Japan is currently anxious about is the transfer of British naval bases in East Asia to the United States and the increasingly severe sanctions against Japan by Washington. However, this anxiety cannot be reduced by the Berlin Treaty. If one of the purposes of the new alliance is to deter the United States with the threat of a two-pronged attack, preventing it from actively participating in the European or Far Eastern wars, then the union of the European and Asian "new order" processes will only make the United States realize the utter senselessness of continuing its isolationist policy. If so, the German-Italian-Japanese alliance will have an effect that was not anticipated, making Britain and the United States more united in their joint struggle and defense. (2nd Reuters)

New York - Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi told a Washington correspondent of the New York Japanese Daily today that the opportunity for well-intentioned people to prevent a direct conflict between Japan and the United States has not yet passed. The first step to understanding is for Foreign Minister Matsuoka and US Ambassador to Japan Grew to hold informal talks. (2nd Reuters)

Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, when asked by reporters about his views on the US-Japan Joint Conference proposed by Howard, the leader of the US Howard newspaper group, aimed at improving US-Japan relations, replied that this idea is indeed interesting, but whether it is practical or timely is questionable. He also stated that the idea of this committee must be implemented only if the group can recognize the "New Order in East Asia." He also stated that the committee is studying facts based on pre-war concepts, which may not be practical. Rather than having this committee, it would be better to let things take their natural course. If the US government could send a delegation to Japan and listen to Japan's views, then this committee might help improve US-Japan relations. The Japanese government has not abandoned the improvement of US-Japan relations, but any American attempt to reach this understanding must be based on recognition of Japan's "New Order in East Asia" and the elimination of the old international structure. (2nd Associated Press)

Tokyo - President Mitsunaga of the Japan Newspaper Federation recently telegraphed US newspaper tycoon Howard, asking him to guide the American public in order to maintain peace in the Pacific. The telegram stated that the crisis in the Pacific is more severe than ever before. If the United States abandons its fortifications in Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Midway Island, abandons its policy of assisting General Chiang Kai-shek, and restores normal US-Japan trade, then this danger can be avoided. Otherwise, in the near future, the United States and Japan will inevitably have an armed conflict. (2nd Associated Press)

### Willkie Delivers Campaign Speech: Attacks New Deal Again

Glenn Abbey, Michigan - Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie delivered a campaign speech here last night amidst the cheers of 30,000 supporters, accusing the New Deal of hindering production and causing unemployment, saying that it has "cut the jugular vein of the United States." He also gave assurances that if he is elected next month, he will find jobs for 9.6 million unemployed Americans, and that the Republican government will maximize and infinitely develop agricultural production.

### Britain Will Provide Active Assistance to China with Allied Treatment: Open Burma Road, Lend Massive Funds to China, Plan to Cut Off Japan's War Materials

London - Due to the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, it is heard that Britain's Far East policy has tended towards opening the Burma Road and treating China as an ally. It is heard that the British government has been considering several measures to actively assist China after or simultaneously with the announcement of the reopening of the Burma Road. It is heard that these plans include allowing a loan of £500,000 or £1 million to Chongqing and sending a central military mission to Chongqing. It is heard that the military mission will be led by a prominent military figure. (2nd Associated Press)

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today warned Britain that if Britain reopens the Burma Road to transport war materials to aid the Chongqing government, Japan will act according to its own ideas. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that when the current Anglo-Japanese agreement expires on October 18, Japan will not request the British to block the Burma Road, but if Britain opens it, Japan will retaliate. In short, Japan will build East Asia according to its established plan, removing all obstacles. The newspaper speculated that due to British and American cooperation in the Pacific, Britain will open this road when the Anglo-Japanese agreement expires. At the same time, according to the Asahi Shimbun, the world's attention is now focused on the plans of Britain and the United States to deal with Japan and the Rome-Berlin Axis alliance. The British and its autonomous governments are holding meetings to plan the cutting off of Japan's war materials. However, the only aspects of Japanese imports affected are iron, zinc, and rubber from Malaya and copper from Canada. Therefore, Japan has nothing to fear in this regard. (2nd Associated Press)

### US Both Parties Advocate: Maintaining Status Quo in Far East, Both Sides Publicly Express Willingness to Cooperate, Urge Government to Take Firm Stance

Washington - Spokespersons for the US Republican and Democratic parties both issued statements last night urging the United States to take a firm stance in the Far East. With both parties publicly expressing their willingness to cooperate with each other, spokespersons for both parties refused to accept the suggestion that the United States withdraw from its Far East policy. Republican leader Wendell Willkie of New York declared in the House of Representatives that the United States must adhere to its status quo in the Far East. He stated that he even agreed that the Philippines should continue to be protected by the United States. If the Philippine Legislative Assembly makes this request to Washington, the United States should accept it, but this move must be initiated entirely by the Philippines. He stated that Japan may misunderstand the United States' motive for granting freedom to the Philippines, thinking that this move is a sign of American weakness. He also stated that the United States had allowed the Philippines to restore its freedom before Japan's invasion of Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Democratic spokesman in the Foreign Affairs Department, Senator Halines of Missouri, also stated that the United States should "maintain its position in the Far East." He stated, "We must intensify our aid to Britain as our response to Japan's joining the Axis alliance. The situation in the Far East a month ago is no longer determined by the Far East, but must be determined by the Atlantic." Halines had supported the US withdrawal from its Far Eastern interests several years ago, but he believed that this should not be done now. He stated that the Japanese side might misunderstand this as American weakness, leading to further incidents. Furthermore, Congress discussed the possibility of the US and the Soviet Union seeking rapprochement to deal with the Far Eastern situation, but most members agreed that this matter had no realistic political basis in the United States, although it was a good opportunity from a diplomatic point of view. Sources with inside information believe that an agreement between the US and the Soviet Union would be of little benefit to the United States, because the United States is not currently in a very good position to begin negotiations with Moscow. (2nd Associated Press)

Washington - Republican Congressman Fish of New York formally issued a statement yesterday, saying that US Far East policy is now "full of explosives." He stated, "Any provocative action may ignite the flames of war. President Roosevelt's empty threats in his Far East policy have driven Japan into the arms of Germany and Italy. The dictatorial New Deal is so chaotic and uneasy that it will inevitably move towards the path of war." He also stated that President Roosevelt must not engage in any military or naval alliances or other war steps with other countries without congressional approval. He stated, "Otherwise, I dare to predict that he will fight in the Far East with a high-handed attitude." (2nd Associated Press)

### US Rapidly Manufactures: Airplanes and Submarines, Defend Western Hemisphere Coast

Washington - Naval circles stated today that the United States' expansion of its submarine fleet and maritime aircraft strength is a major factor in defending the Western Hemisphere from attack. It is said that although the US fleet has achieved balanced strength today, if the submarine tonnage is increased and the maritime aircraft strength is augmented, then various problems encountered in US defense can be more appropriately addressed. The Western Hemisphere coastline is very long and requires a large number of ships to patrol in order to report any alerts immediately. Submarines and maritime aircraft are best suited for this task, so the US is manufacturing these two types of equipment particularly rapidly. (2nd Associated Press)

### India Remits War Fund to Britain

Editorial

### The Soviet Union and Japan in the New Far Eastern Situation

After the announcement of the Tripartite Pact, the world's attention has been unexpectedly focused on the Soviet Union, which spans Europe and Asia and has been granted special reservations in the terms of the pact. What kind of actions will it take in the increasingly critical Pacific situation? The Zhenli Bao's editorial on the 30th has already semi-officially stated the Soviet Union's views on the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact and its continued adherence to its neutral and peaceful policy, but the neutral and peaceful policy cannot restrict its steps to engage in active self-defense, as evidenced by the various events that Eastern Europe has undergone in the past year. Therefore, while it is not close to the facts to speculate that the Soviet Union will join forces with Britain and the United States against Japan, it is even more inappropriate to view the Soviet Union as too passive or even maliciously accuse it of colluding with the three countries. So, under its deep and unwavering consistent line, what exactly will its specific actions be? This is precisely what the safety of half of the Far East depends on in the future.

The actual effectiveness of Japan's Tripartite Pact, apart from spiritual self-comfort, is a big question, but in terms of its relationship with the Soviet Union, it is a loss. Article 4 of the Tripartite Pact stipulates that it does not affect the current relations between the signatory countries and the Soviet Union. That only has a negative meaning, but it can never eliminate the shadow between this alliance and the Soviet Union or make the relations between the three countries and the Soviet Union more advanced. In Japan, there is only an attitude of improving relations with the Soviet Union so far. Its long delay in taking any action suggests that there is considerable resistance to this move within Japan. Moreover, not only has a concrete principle of mutual understanding and approach between the two countries not yet been established, but even the accumulated long-standing outstanding issues have not yet been cleared up. Therefore, the phrase "does not affect relations with the Soviet Union" has great significance only in Germany. It is of little value to Japan. If it is said that after the three countries privately divided Europe and Asia, the Soviet Union, which is in the crevice of the European and Asian "new order", will be humbly respectful and smoothly complete the negotiation of the non-aggression agreement with Japan, that is always difficult to imagine. Japanese right-wing elements have recently paid great attention to relations with the Soviet Union and regarded the realization of friendly relations with the Soviet Union as a prerequisite for implementing the southward advance. At present, there is no progress in Soviet-Japanese diplomacy, and Japan has placed itself in the middle of unprecedented major adventures. This is due to the embarrassment and greed that forced it to wait. On the other hand, it is also sufficient to prove that the Tripartite Pact is mainly based on the interests of the German side. Under the conditions that the hungry are easy to feed, Japan has no possibility of advancing and choosing a time more favorable to its own side.

However, although the Tripartite Pact has not improved Japan's difficulties, it has created the relative isolation of the Soviet Union. The obviousness of the current international division is almost restored to the situation before the Munich Agreement. Only the Soviet Union still has no support and is alone outside the two opposing fronts of democratic countries and Axis countries. For the Soviet Union, this may be the most convenient position to cope with the current war crisis, but whether the increasingly acute confrontation of the international front can allow this absolute neutral attitude to continue to be maintained is a major question. Recently, both major powers have launched diplomatic wars against the Soviet Union, each trying to pull the Soviet Union from neutrality to its own camp. Even if the Soviet Union itself never takes sides, its every move will inevitably have a subtle impact on the advances and retreats of both major powers. Strictly speaking, peace is indivisible, and neutrality cannot exist apart from reality. The Soviet authorities should understand this point better than anyone else. Therefore, people in the world do not have to haggle over the meaning of words, but should pay close attention to its actual trends.

The Zhenli Bao's editorial first pointed out that the relationship between Germany, Italy, and Japan has long existed, but that is precisely aimed at the Soviet Union's anti-communist purpose. At present, the target of the three countries' opposition is clearly not the Soviet Union, but the United States, Britain, and some small and weak nations, but since the anti-communist purpose has not been announced and cancelled, and the internal basis of the anti-communist purpose has not been completely eliminated in the three countries, then the contradiction between the Soviet Union and the Axis countries is now eased, and in the final plan of the Axis countries to divide the world, how it will place the Soviet Union is an interesting question. Of course, regardless of the outcome of the future war, whether the participating parties win or lose, it will be equal to both sides suffering losses. Even the victors will not have the strength to threaten the Soviet Union at that time. However, this cruel idea of treating everything as expendable should not be the original intention of the Soviet Union's neutral and peaceful policy.

At present, the world war situation is still expanding, and the various separated wars also have a tendency to gradually connect with each other, but the nature of the individual cases cannot be summarized by the phrase "the expansion of imperialist war." No matter how the world war develops, China's heroic resistance and the wars caused by opposing the invasion of China and other small and weak nations will not obscure the special significance of its own great glory, and even be classified into the category of imperialist war. There is no doubt about the Soviet Union's fundamental position on this point, and even Germany does not believe that the Soviet Union's military assistance to China is in conflict with the Tripartite Pact. The Soviet Union will not weaken its support for China's resistance because of this. However, for the sake of the thorough security of the Soviet Union's own eastern border, for the sake of clarifying the Pacific situation, and for the sake of not failing the expectations of anti-aggression elements all over the world, the Soviet Union deserves full consideration for any suggestions regarding curbing the atrocities of aggression in the Far East, and should not avoid them for fear of being suspected of participating in the imperialist war.

In short, the Far Eastern situation has come to the eve of a new war due to the Tripartite Pact, and no country along the Pacific coast can absolutely stay out of it. Regarding the future of the Far East, in addition to China's resistance and British and American cooperation, the Soviet Union is the most decisive factor. At present, Japan's desire to advance southward has expanded to its peak, but there is a major weakness in its relations with the Soviet Union. This is also the focus of the struggle between the aggressors and anti-aggressors in the Far East. In addition to maintaining its consistent position, the Soviet Union is also expected to take a positive attitude and measures in response to the current situation.

Since the War of Resistance, he has repeatedly established special merits in Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces, and has been promoted to a specialized position. It is now learned that he died in Xiangyang, which is deeply regrettable. He should be posthumously commended and the Military Affairs Commission should provide generous compensation.

### Zhou Zhongyue Has Not Resigned

Chongqing: A reporter recently met with Zhou Zhongyue, Minister of the Interior, and inquired about his thoughts on the recent fabrication of rumors by the Japanese side.

Recently, they falsely claimed that I suddenly submitted my resignation due to differences of opinion with the Central Government. In fact, I have been in Chongqing day and night, and have never returned to Yunnan, nor have I resigned. During this period of resistance, I will do my utmost to serve the country, and I will never lightly consider retiring until the situation is clear and the national territory is restored. Chairman Long is loyal, patriotic, and obedient to the leader, and has never changed his stance. It is even more inconsistent with the facts to say that Chairman Long's views differ from those of the Central Government. This kind of provocation and sowing of discord has long been seen through by the people of the whole country and is not enough to confuse public opinion." (1st Dispatch)

### The Soviet Union Will Adopt a Policy of Benevolent Neutrality Towards the Axis Powers; It Is Widely Rumored That the German Foreign Minister Will Visit Moscow in an Attempt to Facilitate a Non-Aggression Pact Between Japan and the Soviet Union

Berlin: International News Agency received information from authoritative sources last night that the Soviet Union will assume the role of "sympathetic observer" in the theater of the Axis powers. It is said that the Soviet Union will not participate in the military activities of the German-Italian-Japanese Axis and will instead adopt a policy of benevolent neutrality. However, it is also learned from reliable sources that the Soviet Union may sign a non-aggression pact with Japan, and that Germany and Italy will indeed facilitate this. Informed circles in Berlin do not believe that the Soviet Union will sign an open military agreement with the Axis powers, but observers firmly believe that the Soviet Union will continue to sympathize with the Axis powers. Some influential figures predict that Stalin's position may allow him to "retaliate against the United States for its interference in Soviet affairs and to retaliate against the United States' meddling during the Soviet-Finnish conflict." As for the Soviet Union's immediate participation in the Axis, it is rumored that the German Foreign Minister will soon visit Moscow to hold important talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The German Foreign Ministry has neither confirmed nor denied this rumor, so this speculation has become widespread. (2nd Dispatch, International)

London: Berlin has neither admitted nor denied the rumor that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has gone to Moscow. However, German radio reported that when Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Spanish Foreign Minister Suner left Berlin, the German Foreign Minister was unable to see them off because he had already left for another destination. According to some opinions, Germany intends to create this mystery to create the speculation that the German Foreign Minister has gone to Moscow. Germany cannot help but worry about the reaction of the Soviet Union after the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese Axis pact. It is also conceivable that Ribbentrop will fly to Moscow to dispel Soviet doubts and reach an agreement with the Soviet government. It would be beneficial for Germany if Germany could induce Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to come to Berlin in person. However, Molotov will certainly not fall into their trap, and Germany is prepared to condescend to seek instruction. (2nd Dispatch, Reuters)

### Soviet Spokesman Denies Soviet-Japanese Understanding at the Expense of China - Relations Between Britain and the Soviet Union Are Unlikely to Improve

London: It was generally expected here that Japan's joining the Axis would make the Soviet Union more friendly towards Britain, but the situation has turned out to be the opposite. The Soviet Union's actions seem to be leaning towards Japan, and the already cold relations between Britain and the Soviet Union will become even worse. However, a Soviet spokesman recently told a reporter from the United Press that the rumor that the Soviet Union would sacrifice China to reach an understanding with Japan is absolutely not true. He also said that Moscow does not covet Japan's recognition of Soviet leadership in Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang. Regarding Japan's southward advance, the spokesman said that if the British Navy used it, it would be enough to limit Japan's ambitions. The spokesman said that if the United States extended its naval base from Hawaii to Singapore, Japan's ambitions towards the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, and other Pacific regions would be curbed, and he believed that the presence of major US warships in Singapore would frighten the Japanese and even deter them from invading Hong Kong. Furthermore, diplomatic circles here say that unless the United States rises to remedy the defects in Anglo-Soviet relations, Anglo-Soviet relations are unlikely to improve. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, without waiting for instructions from his government, has already told British Foreign Secretary Halifax that the British proposal is unacceptable.

### Japan Is Eager to Approach the Soviet Union; Tatekawa Goes to Moscow to Take Office and Immediately Begins Diplomatic Activities

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma recently told foreign reporters that if the Soviet Union wishes to conclude a non-aggression pact with Japan, the Japanese government will consider negotiating with it. Suma declined to comment on reports that Germany and Italy were encouraging the Soviet Union to conclude such a treaty. He also said that Lieutenant General Tatekawa, the new Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, who is about to leave for the Soviet Union, is a plenipotentiary representative with the authority to engage in all negotiations.

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today continued to demand closer ties between Japan and the Soviet Union to remove the shackles on Japan's southward advance policy. The Yomiuri Shimbun and Hochi Shimbun both expressed the hope that the recent establishment of an alliance between Japan and the Axis powers could lead to closer ties between Japan and the Soviet Union. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that "the Japanese government should disregard past difficulties and take the necessary steps in accordance with this policy. The reason for the urgency of these measures is that the current diplomatic process of the United States towards the Soviet Union aims to undermine the possibility of closer ties between Japan and the Soviet Union." Asahi Shimbun and Hochi Shimbun stated that the Soviet Union should stop its aid to the Chinese government in order to eliminate obstacles between Japan and the Soviet Union.

### Assisting Britain and Aiding China is the United States' Policy; American Newspapers Write Articles Criticizing the Tripartite Alliance

New York: American newspapers yesterday explained that the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance will hardly hinder the United States from assisting Britain and China. The New York Times stated that the main purpose of this agreement is to deal with the United States. However, the American people have recognized that Britain's victory is important and understand that these three countries, which have become enemies of the American way of life, not only want to divide Europe, Asia, and Africa, but also want to incite Latin America to make their omnipotent power penetrate the New World. This kind of agreement is harmful to us. However, if the United States recognizes the path it is following, its harm can be reduced or eliminated. Increasing aid to Britain and China should be regarded as an essential element in the Western Hemisphere's self-defense policy. The New York World-Telegram stated that the United States currently has no reason to attack any of these three countries that are preparing for an American attack. However, if these three countries combine many wars into one war and directly unite to attack the United States, then the interests of assisting Britain, maintaining order in the Far East, guaranteeing the security of the Americas, and other goals of our defense policy will be threatened. If we face this kind of direct threat, we will naturally deal with it with all the means at our disposal. Japan should not expect us to continue supplying it with munitions as before, and Germany should not expect us to reduce aid to Britain. It should be known that the steps we take are taken after careful consideration. The Chicago Daily News said, "Our assistance to Britain and China is in accordance with the national policy jointly supported by Roosevelt and Willkie. We will continue to assist Britain and China. We have just begun to partially block Japan's military purchases, and we will impose a complete embargo at any necessary time." (2nd Dispatch, United Press)

### European War Miscellany (10) (6) Daily Bombings: Anecdotes of British and German Civilians

In modern warfare, the activities of the air force occupy a very important position. In this European war, the British and German sides bombed each other, back and forth, almost as a daily routine. Both sides keep the real military losses secret. However, judging from the situation in all aspects, the British and German people do not seem to have succumbed under such large-scale air raids, and have shown an attitude of persisting to the end. The following is a translation of the New York Times' account of the actions of the British and German people under the great bombings:

The scope of German air force activities in Britain, in addition to the "heart" of Britain and the ports, is the capital, London. The targets of the bombing are always aircraft fields, factories, oil depots, bridges, and railways. When attacking London, the German aircraft always come from the east. In an instant, strange screams and bombing sounds mix together. Because the German side, in order to intimidate the British, often attaches a strange-sounding whistle to the back of the bomb. Before it explodes, it makes a strange cry, which is heartbreaking. The British "Spitfire" and "Hurricane" aircraft immediately take off to meet the enemy. The sound of machine guns can be faintly heard at an altitude of tens of thousands of feet. The ground anti-aircraft guns fired hundreds of rounds per minute. As a result, the sound of houses collapsing, the cries of women and children, and the sound of aircraft engines mingled together. Under such continuous German air raids, will the morale of the British people be shaken? Judging from the facts, that may not be the case. Women in the countryside are very calm about the bombing. When they are awakened by the sound of bombs nearby at night, they soon hear the maids gently knocking on the door and saying in a calm tone, "Madam, please listen to the sound of the bombs." Children are as calm as adults. One day, a six-year-old child was playing in a garden outside London when suddenly a long, drawn-out scream was heard in the air, followed by a roar, which was a sign that a German bomb was about to come. The child happily said to the adults, "That must be a bomb."

What kind of situation do the British face under German air raids? It depends on the different environment and time when the air raid occurs. Before the air raid siren sounds, German planes are often already appearing in the clouds. Therefore, citizens sometimes use the sound of enemy bombs or the sight of aerial combat as the only air raid warning. At first, when the citizens of London encountered the alarm, they hurriedly ran to the air raid shelters, and the streets were emptied of pedestrians, and buses and other vehicles were completely stopped. Except for the police and ambulance teams, nothing else could be seen. The whole city seemed to be suffering from acute paralysis, and everything seemed to be dead. Now, the situation is somewhat different. Citizens are already accustomed to German air raids. After hearing the alarm, only a few people run into the air raid shelters, and the police and guards have to ask them to "enter the cave." The people on the road have an attitude of not moving until the last minute. Over time, everyone still works as usual when they hear the alarm, and only start to hide when they see the enemy aircraft.

Not moving around without seeing the enemy aircraft has become a firm and unwavering policy. When the various ordnance factories hear the air raid alarm, they turn on the searchlights, and the workers continue to work as usual. If the searchlight shines on an enemy aircraft flying directly towards the factory, then the emergency alarm will sound without a second decision, and everyone will walk into the air raid shelter step by step.

The staff of major stores and banks in the city of London often hear the alarm and go to the air raid shelter, but nothing happens. After a few times, they feel it is too troublesome, and everyone is too lazy to move around, and still sit and work quietly in the sound of the alarm. Although the business authorities oppose this method, what can be done when habit becomes nature? Therefore, even though German planes are flying over the city of London, the public is no longer completely "hiding."

Many munitions factory workers in the "heart" of Britain are also unusually calm. There is a worker who specializes in steelmaking and is very stubborn by nature. When enemy planes come to attack, others hide in the air raid shelters, but he always stays still and continues to work. He uses a lamp with very weak light to illuminate, and everything is unaffected. Once, not long after the air raid alarm, everyone else had run away, and only he was left in the factory guarding the solitary lamp and working. In an instant, a German incendiary bomb fell through the roof. When the firefighters arrived to put out the fire, he said indifferently, "Friends, please put out the fire, but don't put out my little lamp, it's the only light I have!"

There is a hotel in the suburbs of London. One day, a group of journalists came during an air raid alarm. They had just returned from the front line and were preparing to have a snack in the hotel. The hotel owner said to them, "Gentlemen, you can either eat or go to the basement, as you please. I have told the servants here to go to the air raid shelter, but they insist on staying to serve you." From this, we can see even more the calm attitude of the British towards German air raids.

Even in the air raid shelters, everyone is very calm and does not look frightened at all. Sometimes, when there are fewer people, you can see two people playing chess in the corner of the wall. The ladies are either reading books or doing needlework, very quietly. Those who like to smoke can also smoke in the suite. Female typists and stenographers often sing a song slowly, and everyone joins in and sings, full of interest.

There is also a kind of person who is calm in name, but actually shows a stubborn "foolish bravery." They often stand on the street, regardless of everything, and watch the planes fighting in the sky for fun when enemy planes are already flying overhead. If they are not careful, they will die if a bullet flies over. These people are responsible for their own deaths and injuries, but they also involve the ambulance team in doing rescue work, which indirectly creates more trouble. Therefore, the authorities prohibit people from watching the fun in the sky, and anyone who does not have a steel helmet is not allowed to stand on the street.

This kind of so-called "watching the fun" is not only the case in cities, but also in the countryside. Some people who like to do outdoor activities or play ball often continue to play even when air battles are taking place. In a golf course outside London, there were many people playing there when suddenly machine guns started firing from planes in the sky, followed by the sound of bombs exploding. They were having fun and didn't care. It was not until a British "Hurricane" plane landed in the field that this group of people gave up their fun.

After a bombing in the city, a strange scene often appears. You can see several houses on the street, the front of which has been bombed, while the back half is still well preserved, and the furnishings in the house are clear at a glance. It is like a toy house. The strangest thing is that sometimes mirrors and porcelain are still intact. A set of clothes in front of the bed is also folded very well, and has not changed its shape. This is because the front half of the house is sucked away by the vacuum power of the bomb, while the inside is only slightly affected.

People who live in the countryside often encounter very strange things. There is a family living in a town who has a nephew serving in the air force. One day, this nephew came down in a parachute in the air and asked people on the village road, "Where is this?" After they explained it to him, he said, "Great, I have an uncle here." So this boy, who was separated by several miles, descended from the sky and unexpectedly went to his uncle's house to rest for a while.

One day, a lady was peeling beans in the kitchen, preparing to cook a meal. Suddenly, a German airman who had been forced to land from a bomber came to the door, and she grabbed him. The British treat captured German soldiers in a decent manner. The most needed things for German soldiers are beer and cigarettes. If there is a bar nearby, then they will of course get beer first. The people who catch the German soldiers also toast with their prisoners.

Although there are many deaths and injuries in the cities under air raids, the morale of the British people is very strong. The bombed shops hang a wooden board at the doorway with the words "Business as usual." Women often say to people, "Yes, our house has been bombed, but don't worry about anything, what does it matter?" Immediately after the air raid, people come out to raise funds to help the bombed refugees.

Why are the British so calm? There is also a reason for this. In addition to the strong and unyielding personality of the British people, they have great confidence in the strength of their air force. When they hear the news of how many German planes have been shot down by their air force, they are all very excited. They feel that hiding in the air raid shelter and "waiting to die" is a sign of cowardice. They are united in their hatred of the enemy and must retaliate. Moreover, the common people are all proud to be able to take risks with the air force soldiers.

As for the attacks by the British Air Force on various parts of Germany, the British claim that their losses are "very heavy"; while the Germans often respond with "the British are completely fabricating rumors." British aircraft used sixty heavy bombers to attack Hamburg. The British aircraft were already familiar with the important military centers there, such as munitions factories, aircraft fields, warehouses, bridges, railways, and ports. Under "unloading-style" bombing, how could they not hit any of them? The difference between the British and German armies is that the British Air Force mainly uses dispersed bombing, while the Germans focus on concentrated bombing.

British aircraft bombing Germany often causes Germans to feel very painful. Once, British aircraft attacked Babelsberg, a suburb of Berlin. Although there were not many deaths and injuries, a bomb hit the telephone exchange, so everyone was out of touch for several days. Of all of Germany, the southwest region suffered the most bombings by British troops, followed by the north. The British Air Force went to bomb in shifts, causing the Germans to be constantly harassed. The headquarters simply issued a notice saying, "In the future, if only one enemy aircraft comes to attack, the air raid alarm will no longer be issued, so as to avoid disturbing the citizens in the industrial center."

From May 17 to July 8, Hamburg was attacked by British aircraft 28 times. Many times it was three times a day, and the losses were said to be not small. However, according to the German side, only one out of ten British aircraft can break through the fire net, so there are no major losses. The residents of the Ruhr area suffered the most harassment from British aircraft, and hardly had a good night's sleep. The air raids in the middle of the night and early morning were the most unbearable. From 2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m., everyone would get up from bed and quickly hide in the air raid shelter when they heard the alarm. Over time, it became a habit, and almost at this time, they would automatically report to the air raid shelter.

In early September, Berlin was subjected to continuous air raids by British aircraft. At the worst, citizens had to sleep in the air raid shelter for twelve hours. Because of carelessness or accidentally catching a cold, many people suffered from the flu. A pharmacy in the center of Berlin sold out all cough lozenges and cold medicine in a week of British air raids. In order to prevent catching a cold, the citizens of Berlin later put on coats when they heard the air raid alarm, and then walked into the air raid shelter.

The air raid shelters in the Ruhr area are equipped with all kinds of furniture, and even beds for children are arranged in this basement. As soon as it gets dark, they take their children into the shelter to spend the night until the next morning. The calmness of the Germans in the western region is also quite admirable. A couple was about to celebrate their silver wedding anniversary. In view of the difficult situation, they did not want to hold a celebration. One day, when the air raid alarm sounded loudly, the couple walked into the air raid shelter and saw that a celebration scene had been prepared for them inside. It turned out that a few neighbors in their apartment knew that the air raid alarm came on time and had been tested repeatedly, so they held a celebration in the air raid shelter, and everyone enjoyed themselves and dispersed.

In an air raid shelter in Charlottenburg, West Berlin, on the night of September 25, a 21-year-old young woman gave birth to a child inside. Fortunately, a female nurse trained by the Red Cross knew how to deliver a baby, so both mother and child were safe. This is a novel event in the air raid shelter.

### British Air Force Shows Its Power in Germany; Fiercely Attacks Berlin, Dropping Bombs Like Rain; Destroys Power Stations and Disrupts Railway Traffic; American Pilots Lead Team to Assist British in Battle for the First Time

From the night before last to yesterday morning, British aircraft fiercely attacked Berlin for three and a half hours, dropping large and small bombs as dense as raindrops. At the same time, other British bombers were active in various parts of Germany. The Air Headquarters' Intelligence Office stated that when British aircraft attacked Berlin, they used the firelight to identify the western power station that had been heavily damaged in the previous attack. After the first batch of bombs were dropped, there was a violent explosion, followed by fires in many places. The Klingenberg power station was also bombed, and railways and factories were set on fire. The British heavy bombers took off from 10:30 p.m. and flew over Berlin until 2:00 a.m. before returning. The British aircraft active in other parts of Germany attacked the railway yard in Mannheim. Huge bombs exploded continuously with great force. The firelight flickered, and it was thought that a pile of ammunition had been hit and exploded. Also, high-explosive bombs were dropped on the oil refineries and railway yards in Hanover and Runa (north of Leipzig), hitting their targets. The sound of explosions was endless, and the aircraft caught fire. Another batch of bombs also hit and caught fire. The two fires merged, and another explosion occurred. The aircraft's fuselage was hit, and six fires broke out. The sound of explosions gradually subsided only after the British aircraft dropped the last batch of bombs. The pilots of the British aircraft that bombed the railway yard in Mannheim believed that many ammunition trains had been destroyed because of the continuous explosions of huge bombs. The port of Mannheim was also bombed, and the fire was so bright that it illuminated the sky. British aircraft also attacked the railway yards near the ports of Ostend and Brussels, which also caught fire. A British bomber shot down a German aircraft on its way back after the attack. Also, British coastal aircraft and naval aircraft attacked the shipyards and oil storage depots in Rotterdam, the shipyards and cargo docks in Ostend, and the piles of aircraft in the Hansted airfield, hitting their targets and causing fires. Five British aircraft went missing. Also, two British Air Force bombers flew out on a reconnaissance mission in the morning and shot down two German Dornier Do 18 bombers, both of which crashed into the sea. (2nd Reuters)

### The Full Picture of German Espionage and Plainclothes Activities

American Naval Intelligence Colonel Donavan and journalist Mueller, under the orders of U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox, investigated German espionage activities in Europe. Upon their return, they submitted a voluminous report of tens of thousands of words. Among other things, it details the organization, scope of activities, and effectiveness of the German plainclothes unit (i.e., the so-called Fifth Column). We now present a summary based on the full text released by Knox, as follows:

What is the key to the effectiveness of German espionage and plainclothes units? We can find the answer in Hitler's own words. He once said, "We certainly need an army, but not in the way it was used during the Great War of 1914. In the future, the function of artillery can be replaced by propaganda, which will be greatly reformed. Before the army starts fighting, we must first psychologically demoralize the enemy, so that they want to surrender without even engaging in battle... Our weapon is to make the enemy mentally confused, indecisive, and panic-stricken. The history of revolutions around the world... is all the same: the ruling class always surrenders first. Why? Because the psychology of defeat has long been at work, and they are at a loss."

"Money makes the world go round." The German espionage and plainclothes organizations spend a massive $200 million annually to "drive" all their secret operations. Its organization is centered on the Nazi Party and uses an "overseas organization division" as a tool. This division has as many as four million "comrades" stationed in foreign countries, all of whom are capable and talented individuals. There are 600 local branches in 45 countries around the world. The headquarters is located in Stuttgart, Germany, and a director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs named Baume directs all affairs. He has approximately 800 subordinates and assistants. The names of the overseas local branches are not uniform and vary according to the local environment. In short, the phrase "inventing titles and disguising well" encompasses everything. Among the four million people engaged in espionage and plainclothes work, there are genuine Germans, "neutralized" Germans, and even non-Germans. The so-called "neutralized" Germans are those who reside in foreign countries and can obtain the nationality of their host country, whether it be American or Portuguese, but their original German nationality can still be retained. These are the people who can cooperate internally and externally in secret when something happens. Children born abroad fifty years ago are still recognized by the Berlin government as German citizens. Anyone who can "pledge allegiance" to Germany, even if they are not German, is regarded as a treasure by the Nazi Party, which searches for and recruits them everywhere, with a great sense of "eagerly seeking talent." Foreigners whom the Germans regard as "of the same blood," such as Scandinavians, Dutch, Flemings, German-speaking Swiss, and even Anglo-Saxons, are treated even more like brothers and sisters, and are relied upon even more.

Within the vast furnace of German espionage organizations, there are actually seven other organizations under the same banner. They are: the political secret police, Goebbels' propaganda department, the Labor Front, the intelligence departments of the army, navy, and air force, and the embassies and consulates stationed in various countries. These agencies spend a total of $200 million annually on espionage, propaganda, reconnaissance, and persuasion. This is a considerable sum, but Hitler is willing to reduce the number of infantry troops rather than be stingy with this type of expenditure. To put it bluntly, the few great victories that this massive organization of 30,000 people has created for Hitler, when compared to the price paid and the actual benefits received, are truly immeasurable. It's like doing business, "a small investment yields huge profits," it is close to this.

Although the number of personnel in each branch is large, the organization and discipline are the same everywhere. Their sole creed is loyalty to Germany and service to Hitler. To achieve this goal, they resort to all kinds of means, such as fraud, threats, intimidation, and even murder, without any scruples. In the end, the German plainclothes units overseas are often instructed by their headquarters to obey the laws of their host country. However, the most important thing is to constantly instill in the minds of the people of their host country the idea that German victory is assured.

The organization and functions of the German army, navy, and air force intelligence departments are largely the same as those of other countries. What is particularly special is that they have a "psychological experiment" group, which has a wide range of activities. Internationally, it not only trains spies, but also the secret work of overseas secret police branches and party branches is derived from this group. In terms of worker activities, an "International Central Bureau" was established in Hamburg in 1936, allowing Germany and other countries to cooperate in undermining the labor movement in democratic countries. Members of the German Labor Front, when working abroad, often gather information on foreign ships, shops, and factories.

All German embassies and consulates around the world have intelligence attachés who are in charge of important propaganda work. There are 1,700 German-language daily newspapers published in various countries, with a circulation of 3 million copies. They often pay high prices to acquire various manuscripts and publish them in the newspapers. In addition, they pay attention to the local German-language radio broadcasting work. Connecting with local newspapers and attacking anti-Hitler newspapers and magazines are also their main tasks.

General Liederapp, director of the German Colonial Political Department, is in charge of propaganda work in the colonies of various countries. If highly confidential work is involved, the political police department often directly sends people to carry out everything. When the situation becomes tense, they focus their efforts on concentrating their strength in a certain important place. It is said that a German radio expert managed to find an insignificant position at an American broadcasting station, mingled in it, and secretly communicated news with German headquarters. There is also a secret organization that specializes in communicating with soldiers at the front lines. German espionage agencies often use German maids in foreign residences to spy on their owners' information. A Dutchman once hired a "deaf" German cook. One day, he suddenly heard her talking in the kitchen with a complete stranger in fluent "Oxford" accents. He knew something was wrong and quickly dismissed the maid, but by the time she left, several important documents had disappeared. The Germans also use young students to report news. They are sent to study abroad or exchange studies with students from other countries, and are first given espionage training before leaving the country. When they return to their country after completing their studies, they will not lack ways to serve the country.

During this European war, all the defeated countries, such as Poland, Norway, Denmark, and France, etc., did not escape the "blessings" of the German plainclothes units. Among them, the most ingenious and the one that Hitler considered most successful was naturally the surrender of France. Sun Tzu said: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." The Germans were too familiar and too "expert" with everything about France. So they struck at the most appropriate time. No matter how many strategists and soldiers France had, they could not defeat the hard work that the Germans had accumulated over time. Even if France had a strong Maginot Line, it could not be destroyed by a wavering public mind. Moreover, France's military deployment was far inferior to that of Germany.

The German plan to subvert France, even from the perspective of espionage, was a "long-term" and patient endeavor. In addition to the agile and well-organized spies, they also used beautiful women as bait. Celebrated socialites such as Baroness Heimann Romm and Princess Anne-Lotte were all leaders in the women's ranks. Relying on their "beauty," they had already captivated people's hearts and made it difficult for them to control themselves, not to mention that they had all received considerable training. After they hooked up with several key figures, they took the opportunity to constantly play the "record of defeatist psychology" in the depths of their "love prisoners'" minds. They also used bought newspapers to create the brilliant theory of "non-resistance and national peace." As a result, French political figures initially thought that German propaganda was correct, and the more they listened, the more reasonable it seemed. They then entered the German spy "trap" and would never be able to escape. The German spies' slogan to the French was always: if France could give up being friends with Britain and the Soviet Union, not interfere with German actions in Central and Eastern Europe, and cede a portion of unimportant land to Italy, then France and Germany could "live in harmony" and be at peace with each other. Prime Minister Daladier's proclamation to the world two months before the war was also full of vigor and promise. Who knew that in the blink of an eye, everything would change completely. It was all thunder and no rain, truly worthy of Daladier.

The German efforts in espionage and propaganda in Britain were also not insignificant. The most notable example was "Lord Haw-Haw" in radio broadcasts, who broadcast unfavorable news to the British every night, trying to mess up the minds of the British people. Although bribery and buying off British people to speak for Germany did happen, the results were probably far less than those achieved in France. In the years before the war, the Germans did a lot of goodwill and friendly work among the British people. The Germans established several associations in Britain to promote Anglo-German relations, and even slogans of pro-German sentiment came from the mouths of the British people. The Germans also invited British gentlemen and ladies to visit Germany to see Hitler's German policies, and sent many noble and handsome young men to accompany them as tour guides. However, the British police were not easily fooled. On one occasion, they wanted to arrest Ramsay, a member of parliament who was secretly communicating with the Germans and endangering national security. Since Chamberlain's appeasement of Germany, the breakdown of peace, and the outbreak of war, the British have paid great attention to the activities of the German Fifth Column. At the beginning of the war, the police arrested more than 400 well-known German spies. After this purge, German espionage activities in Britain naturally decreased. However, the period of precariousness for Britain has not yet ended. Whether there will be any "surprises" in the future, we can only wait and see.

In this war, Hitler's performance has been mostly in the style of "many strange clouds in summer." In terms of his weapons and methods of warfare, he always used the tactic of catching people off guard and striking them hard. During air raids, bombs were attached with strange-sounding devices. During attacks, hundreds of artillery pieces concentrated their fire. Not to mention that new recruits were frightened out of their wits, even veterans were shocked by it. The trick of the Sudeten Germans when annexing Czechoslovakia had already been exposed by the world. What followed was a consistent pattern of attacking Poland, invading Norway, attacking Denmark, invading the Netherlands, and attacking France. Overall, it was smooth sailing and three times the profit.

The number of German spies mixed in with the Polish people was considerable. They were all under the guidance of the secret police and were regarded as industrialists, traveling salesmen, waiters, and coachmen, infiltrating the Polish people and doing counter-espionage work. In addition, there were millions of people who claimed to be loyal to Poland, but were actually undermining the country. On the eve of the war, these Germans, under the direction of Berlin, first made things difficult for the Poles, creating so-called "unfortunate incidents." Other Germans created a terror situation in the Polish countryside. Germans who could speak Polish forged orders and "commanded" everything on the radio. Some people also sent signals to the German air force at military targets, leading them to bomb. The Germans themselves admitted that if the Polish army could have held out for another two weeks, it would have created a war of attrition for Germany.

The successive fall of Norway and Denmark was also caused by the gains of the German plainclothes units. The conquest of the Netherlands was particularly meticulous. On the day of the invasion of the Netherlands, the Germans, hidden in large boats, occupied the famous Moerdijk Bridge in the Netherlands. As a result, the German army solved the southern war with little effort. In addition, 120,000 Germans lived in various parts of the Netherlands, cooperating internally and externally, resulting in an uncontrollable situation. Before the war, 250 German officials in The Hague used the special preferential provisions of diplomacy as the basis for all their activities. This does not include the personnel of other consulates. Hundreds to one hundred self-proclaimed German journalists traveled throughout the Netherlands, inspecting military terrain and conducting economic research. German servants constantly spied on their masters for information, copied documents, and reported to their country. As soon as the German army entered Dutch territory, these people took out their red badges and acted as guides for the army.

Approximately 60,000 Germans resided in Belgium. After the outbreak of the war, they were the first to destroy the Albert Canal, the first line of defense in Belgium. These 60,000 people were also guided by Germans in diplomatic, business, and art circles, creating various organizations that effectively harmed Belgium. By the time the King of Belgium announced his surrender, it was too late. The other amazing deeds of the German plainclothes units are truly too numerous to mention, but their principles and methods are largely the same as those described above.

U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox said: "In addition to resisting the enemy's military aggression, the next most important thing is to defend against the enemy's propaganda." Knox's emphasis on espionage activities can be known. (The End)

British Aircraft Heavily Bomb German Bases Across the Strait, Flames Light Up the Sky

London - The British Royal Air Force resumed its raids on German bases on the French coast last night. Around 10 p.m., the loud explosions of bombs dropped by the British Air Force shook the entire English Channel. From Dover, even in the shadowy darkness, the flames along the French coast could be observed. The targets of the British Royal Air Force bombing were apparently the German artillery positions in Boulogne and Calais. (2nd Associated Press)

Air Raid Alarms Sound Frequently Across the British Isles as German Aircraft Launch Extensive Attacks

London - Last night, German aircraft bombed the British Isles extensively, on a scale unprecedented since the beginning of the war. As soon as the German aircraft that carried out the night raids left, alarms sounded again in London this morning. Anti-aircraft batteries on the outskirts of the city fired furiously at the German aircraft, which soared high in the clouds, obscured by the sunlight, making them almost impossible to spot. The strengthened British anti-aircraft batteries worked hard to drive away the German aircraft last night, and the alarms were lifted before midnight, the earliest that a night raid alarm had been lifted since London became encircled by air attacks. However, many London residents suspected that the German aircraft were using a cunning trick, lingering in the suburbs and refusing to leave their shelters and trenches. Sure enough, the alarms soon sounded again throughout the city, but this time no German aircraft reached London. Some areas in the interior around London were also visited by German aircraft, but the damage was minimal and the casualties were few. A certain neutral air force expert here stated that the air raids on London yesterday and today were undoubtedly less intense than before, but the British Air Force's air raids on Germany are becoming increasingly strengthened. According to British pilots who returned from bombing the center of German troop transport ships today, Germany's preparations for the invasion of Britain, even if not completely abandoned, have become more relaxed than before. (2nd International News Service)

In the Early Morning, Two Squadrons of German Aircraft, Each with Seven or Eight Planes, Flew Over Central London, Followed by Spitfire Fighters. They Dropped Multiple Bombs in Areas Where Londoners Were Gathered, Causing Some Casualties. Until 2 p.m., London Issued Only Two Air Raid Alerts. When the First Alert Was Issued, No Air Force Activity Was Detected in Central London, But When the Second Alert Was Issued, the Sounds of Anti-Aircraft Fire and Bomb Explosions from Southeastern London Were Clearly Audible. The Air Ministry and the Security Ministry Jointly Issued a Statement Last Night Stating That a Total of Four German Aircraft Were Shot Down Yesterday, While the British Lost Three Aircraft. The Statement Also Said That Some Bombs Were Dropped on the Coast of Wales, Causing Some Damage. (2nd Associated Press)

Enemy Aircraft Attacked London Last Night, Anti-Aircraft Batteries on the Outskirts of London Roared with Loud Explosions and Intense Fire.

The Alarms Sounded Again, and Anti-Aircraft Guns Fired Fiercely. (2nd Reuters)

London - As of Noon Today, Central London Has Experienced Three Air Raids, But So Far No Major Damage Has Occurred. German Aircraft Apparently Cannot Break Through the British Fire Net, and As a Result, Most of Their Bombs Are Dropped in Southeastern London, Causing Only Minor Damage. This Morning, German Aircraft Repeatedly Attacked Southeastern Britain, But Were Intercepted and Driven Away by British Fighter Planes. According to Current Reports, Eight German Aircraft Have Been Shot Down Since Midnight, While No British Fighter Planes Have Been Lost. (2nd Reuters)

High-Range Artillery on the French Coast Hit a British Ship Inside the Port of Dover. (2nd Reuters)

### The British Coastline is Heavily Defended, with Secret Weapons Deployed to Prepare for Enemy Attacks

Amazing secret weapons in British coastal military camps, which seem to make the German army afraid to approach, are now spread all over the British coast, waiting for the German army that threatens to attack. These amazing weapons, some are deployed on the ground, some are deployed in the dust, what exactly are they, the reporter cannot tell you. But the reporter discovered some unexpected events on the front line. The reporter is only in one area of the coast, but wherever he goes, he sees soldiers with determined expressions gazing at the sea, their faces are terrifying. An officer told the reporter that 2 million British troops are now gathered along the coast, guarding strategic ambush locations, preparing to repel the attacking enemy. The writer witnessed the operation of some extremely amazing weapons today. One type is specially used to deal with dive bombers. I was permitted to know the function of this weapon, but I cannot report it to the public, the reason is obvious, no need to say more. What can be said is that at the time, I almost did not believe what I saw and heard. The British also have a weapon that they hope can be used to solve the problem of German aircraft night attacks. The third type of amazing defense is on the ground, this defense is a fortress line. The British miscalculated and built this line, with the intention of stopping the German army, so they specifically named it the "Stop Line." (2nd International News Agency)

### Spain Will Continue to Maintain Its Status as a Non-Belligerent Nation; Suner Continues to Meet with Italy, Especially Focusing on the Mediterranean Issue

Madrid - According to a semi-official announcement, Spain's position regarding the European war remains unchanged. (2nd Reuters)

Rome - Spanish Interior Minister Suñer had a long meeting with Mussolini last night, the results of which are unknown. (2nd Reuters)

Madrid - Interior Minister Suñer met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for an hour and a half yesterday morning and is scheduled to return to Italy on Thursday. It is expected that Spain will have further political developments after Suner's return. It is rumored that the Spanish government has cracked down on a wide range of policies, but the "Daily Telegraph" quoted a telegram from Rome as saying that this trip by Suner will not cause a change in Spanish policy (2nd Reuters)

Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met here with Spanish Interior Minister Suñer, who had recently arrived from Berlin, to discuss plans for Spain to strengthen cooperation with the Axis powers. They met for approximately eighty-five minutes. It is reported that they discussed Spain's demands for Gibraltar and the colony of Morocco. Sources also reported that they discussed plans for the rebellion of Arabs in Africa with Spain and Italy as leaders in the Near East. Although Suñer is still in Rome meeting with Mussolini, it is believed that as soon as Suner returns to Madrid and discusses with General Franco, Spain will sign a treaty and join the Axis powers. Observers also stated that Franco, Mussolini, and Hitler may have a meeting to announce Spain's joining the Rome-Berlin Axis. Spanish Interior Minister Suner was also entertained by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday. Ciano also attended the meeting between Suner and Mussolini. (2nd Associated Press)

London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that Italian newspapers and radio broadcasts are all praising the importance of Spanish Interior Minister Suner's visit to Rome, apparently wanting to indicate that there will be an unexpected major diplomatic development in the world within the next twenty-four hours. Whether Suner will sign a special agreement in Rome is a matter of speculation, but judging from the situation, Suner may not sign a formal document joining the German-Italian-Japanese Pact, as the Tripartite Pact is aimed at the United States, and Spain is unlikely to publicly participate. German newspapers mostly stated that the Rome talks were related to the Mediterranean issue, and especially emphasized Gibraltar and North Africa. (2nd Reuters)

Rome - An Italian official news agency said that the talks between Spanish Interior Minister Suner and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano would clarify Spain's non-belligerent status, although this talk is extremely important, but it is not expected to go beyond this scope. According to Roman political circles, the Italian side has not put pressure on Spain to abandon its non-belligerent status and participate in the war against the United States. Suner held important talks with German and Italian diplomatic officials in Berlin, and Germany and Italy regard Spain as an important member of the new European order and decided to provide it with full assistance, so that Spain can regain its due position in Europe. "The Italian Daily" said that Spain's sympathy for Germany and Italy, even if it does not develop into participation in the war, is still beneficial to the Axis powers. (2nd Reuters)

British aircraft also attacked Linbrook, with waterfront houses being hit and set on fire, and a ship in the harbor was also believed to have been hit. British Air Force bombers, taking off from Sudan, attacked Guera, with bombs hitting the target area, causing flashes of fire and smoke to rise. One British aircraft did not return. Also, an enemy bomber attempted to attack Aden but was attacked by a British fighter plane and quickly escaped, but black smoke was seen coming from its left engine.

### Romania: Germanization, Germans Appointed as Mayors in Twelve Major Cities Nationwide

Bucharest - Foreigners in Cerninia and Banat have appointed Germans as administrative chiefs. Not only that, but in the twelve major cities of Romania, even those with only a few German residents have elected Germans as mayors and deputy mayors. From this, it can be seen that Romania is now gradually becoming a German-controlled country. The training affairs of the Romanian military are now being taken over by German and Italian pilots. Many Italian pilots have already arrived here. It is heard that the Fascist Iron Guard is now demanding the arrest of Romanian politicians who are pro-British. Sixty-seven former government officials have been imprisoned in a prison not far from Bucharest. (Reuters, 2nd)

Bucharest - Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu sent a letter to the British Ambassador to Romania last night, promising to conduct a thorough investigation into the five British citizens recently arrested in Bucharest. The five arrested British citizens are currently under strict surveillance. Since their arrest, they have only been allowed to see visitors once, and the time was very short. British Ambassador Campbell asked the Romanian government to explain the reasons for their arrest. The Romanian Prime Minister replied to this today. The British Consul, after receiving special permission from the Romanian Prime Minister last night, went to visit the arrested British citizens for several minutes. According to the British Consul, the Romanian authorities admitted that two British citizens had been mistreated. Those arrested looked haggard, but there were no scars, and the police treatment was still good.

### Approaching Double Tenth National Day: City to Celebrate Enthusiastically, Promoting Donation, Frugality, and Winter Clothing Drives, Concession Authorities to Implement Security Measures as Usual

October 10th is the National Day of the Republic of China. Due to the special environment of Shanghai, people from all walks of life in the city do not intend to overdo the preparations, and have decided to follow the usual practice of hanging flags and taking holidays, and enthusiastically promoting four major campaigns. Details are recorded as follows:

Hanging Flags to Mark the Celebration

Various agencies, organizations, schools, courts at all levels, post offices, customs, shops, and households in the city, in order to commemorate the Double Tenth National Day, and in accordance with the eight-day flag-hanging method agreed upon by various public organizations and the concession authorities, will uniformly hang flags and take holidays to mark the celebration on this day. However, given the extraordinary times and the ongoing national crisis, in compliance with the central government's instructions, grand celebrations will not be held. Various organizations and schools will hold simple commemorative ceremonies separately to express their congratulations.

Four Major Campaigns

All sectors of the city have launched four major campaigns to celebrate National Day: (1) Continuing donations, (2) Frugal disaster relief, (3) Soliciting winter clothing, (4) National construction savings, in order to enrich the strength of the war of resistance and achieve final victory. It is heard that various industry associations and citizens have decided to start promoting these four campaigns on this day in order to collect a certain amount and contribute to the government and charitable organizations for distribution.

Joint Security Measures

In order to ensure the safety of the area, the two concession authorities have decided to prohibit all meetings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities from the 5th onwards, and at the same time, they will begin special joint security measures, block unnecessary roads and alleys, and strictly enforce curfew laws. At the same time, all police personnel, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and the garrison forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai will be dispatched to assist in security. As for the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, they may not be blocked.

### Affected by the Current Situation, the Yarn Market is Unstable, Yarn Factories are Reducing Work, Silk Factories are Mostly Closed

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section reported for September that the economic situation of the city's industrial sector did not improve last month. A large number of yarn factories, in addition to having already stopped work on Sundays, also stopped work on Saturdays last month, and it is feared that they may continue to reduce work in the future. The decline in exchange rates has prompted speculators to purchase, but the trend has been affected by the weak purchasing power of the citizens. Fresh cocoons have not yet arrived. Only two silk factories are still working, and one of them is about to close. Some dyeing factories have resumed work due to seasonal developments, but it is feared that this will not last long. Several light bulb factories have also resumed work and are busy manufacturing small light bulbs for Christmas. Most small-capital industries are suffering a lot due to the lack of cash to purchase raw materials, while the proceeds from the sale of inventory are limited. In addition, the industrial sector in this port is greatly affected by the restrictions on the transportation of raw materials from the interior to Shanghai and the prohibition of the transportation of Shanghai goods to the interior.

It is heard that since the signing of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, people in the cotton yarn industry here are deeply worried that war will break out in the Far East, so the import of cotton yarn has almost completely stopped. At present, the cotton yarn stored in various yarn factories in this port is only enough for three months. However, the statement in the Japanese newspaper that the yarn factories of Chinese, British, and Japanese merchants may be forced to close down at the beginning of next year is an exaggeration. The current situation of the yarn market is very unstable, and no one can predict what the future holds. According to the manager of a major foreign cotton yarn import company, it is extremely difficult for Chinese yarn to enter Shanghai, because various restrictions make it impossible for Chinese yarn to be imported permanently, and relying solely on Chinese yarn will definitely not be able to meet the needs of various yarn factories in the city.

### National Musician Wei Zhongle Returns from the United States, Playing Overseas to Bring Glory to the Country, Datong Music Society Holds Meeting to Welcome

Mr. Wei Zhongle, the musical director of the Datong Music Society on Songshan Road (Route Ghisi), went to the United States in 1938. He has held concerts in Washington, New York, Hollywood, San Francisco, and major cities, a total of more than 100 performances. He has won the reputation of a world-class performer and brought much glory to Chinese culture. He has now returned to China. The colleagues of the Datong Music Society and Mr. Wei's relatives and friends held a tea party at the Zhengyi Society in the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road on the morning of the day before yesterday (September 29) to express their welcome. In addition to all the members of the Datong Music Society, there were also more than 100 enthusiastic national music lovers from all walks of life, such as Zhang Boyan, Ying Sunling, Guo Jixun, Zhu Mouyuan, Ye Youyun, Wu Xinzhai, and Xu Jian. Mr. Shen, the consultant of the society, was publicly elected as chairman and delivered a welcome speech. Then, Mr. Wei reported on his experiences in the United States, and the guests gave speeches. Finally, Mr. Wei played the guqin, pipa, and erhu, and distributed autographed photos to thank the guests. A photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned. It is heard that Mr. Wei has now been hired as a music professor at Shanghai University and is planning to promote the society's affairs and enroll students with the colleagues of the Datong Music Society in order to popularize it.

### Wife of the British Ambassador to Japan Quietly Arrives in Shanghai, Reportedly for Private Travel Only, Reporters from Various Newspapers Were Refused Interviews

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that the wife of British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, quietly arrived in Shanghai yesterday (October 1) from Tokyo on the NYK Line's "Nituta Maru." According to a British Embassy spokesman, the Ambassador's wife's visit to Shanghai is purely private and has no special purpose. Reporters from various newspapers in the city wanted to meet the Ambassador's wife this morning in order to ascertain the nature of her visit to Shanghai, but were refused. It is heard that Lady Craigie will "purchase items" in Shanghai and stay for a few days, returning to Japan in the early part of next week. She is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel.

### Rice Market Makes Every Effort to Raise Prices, National Rice Nears the 100 Yuan Mark, Authorities Order All National and Foreign Rice to be Evaluated at a Fixed Price

The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee held a plenary meeting the day before yesterday. All members believed that it was extremely difficult to evaluate according to the current price of rice. Therefore, it was decided to report the matter to the authorities and, after obtaining their consent, to hold another meeting to negotiate. Yesterday, the representatives received a temporary telegram from the authorities, stating that they were already aware of the difficulties in evaluation, so they only sent the prepared letter by special messenger. The representatives then stopped going to the bureau. The association will continue to meet after receiving a reply from the authorities.

National Rice Will Also Be Evaluated

It has been learned that the two concession authorities have also ordered the rice industry to fix the price of national rice. Otherwise, the price of national rice will rise frequently, and the market price of foreign rice will also follow suit. Now that the rice industry will implement this, it will, together with the representatives of the authorities, evaluate and fix the standard market price of national and foreign rice, announce it to the market, and implement it earnestly. In addition to the 5,000 tons (i.e., 50,000 bags) of No. 2 West American rice that has already been telegraphed and traded, various rice industry firms telegraphed for 2,000 tons of foreign rice from Jinan Huahang the day before yesterday. As a result of the negotiations, the transportation, insurance, and other issues have not yet been settled, so the deal has not yet been concluded. However, a large number of telegrams will be made for transactions within a few days.

Yesterday's New High Price

The rice market tea party opened as usual at 7:30 yesterday morning. The market situation was chaotic and abnormal, and people were uneasy. Speculative rice merchants became more and more active, raising prices wildly and making every effort to do so. The situation was tense and relaxed. As a result, the opening price of national rice reached a high of 96 yuan per picul. This kind of new peak is rare in Shanghai's history. However, most of the transactions were done in secret. Customers and buyers were unwilling to continue absorbing because the opening price was too high, and there were not many transactions.

Noodle Supply Measures

The Shanghai Machine-Made Cut Noodle Industry Association has a total of 376 members in the city. However, due to the hoarding of flour by some people, there is a shortage of spot goods on the market, and all members of the association are panicked. Subsequently, representatives were sent to petition the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Deputy General Manager He has now made arrangements. Four flour shops have agreed: Yuanfeng will supply 500 bags, Wanfeng 800 bags, Tongshengchang 400 bags, and Ding Houji 330 bags, a total of 2,030 bags, for the use of various cut noodle shops. The price of cut noodles has been set at 34 cents per catty, and this limit price must not be exceeded.

### French Concession Rent Committee to Complete Investigation Report, Chinese, Russian, and French Groups Have Submitted Reports, British and American Groups Have Not Completed Work Properly, Currently Conducting Legal Research and Will Make Concrete Recommendations

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that the French Consulate recently issued an order establishing a housing committee to investigate the housing problem in the French Concession. Yesterday (October 1), according to Mr. Coquelin, chairman of the committee and legal advisor to the French Concession Municipal Council, the Chinese, Russian, and French groups of the committee have submitted detailed reports on the investigation of the housing problem, among which

there are not a few contradictions. As for the investigation reports of the British and American groups of the committee, which have been delayed for a long time, they will also be submitted to the committee within a week. At this point, the investigation work will be completed, and then the committee will submit recommendations to the French Consul (the honorary chairman of the committee) to improve the housing situation in the French Concession. Mr. Coquelin is currently conducting legal research on this matter in preparation

to make recommendations.

It is not yet known in what way these recommendations will be made. However, according to Mr. Coquelin, strict measures will be taken to curb the collection of small rents and arbitrary price increases, and the forced sale of furniture. At the same time, some landlords in the city have prohibited tenants from reselling their leases and demanding exorbitant transfer fees. It is heard that the recommendations to be submitted by the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee, if adopted by the French Consulate and implemented by order, will require

all residents to obey.

It is also heard that the committee will also make recommendations to the qualified judicial authorities. Due to the lack of housing in the city, some tenants take the opportunity to demand transfer fees at will when reselling their leases, and the rents charged are also unheard of, so there are quite a few people who make a great profit.

### August Foreign Trade, Japanese Imports Actually Rank First, Native Exports to the U.S. Reach Record High

### Shanghai Municipal Council Special Committee Studies Financial Revenue, Welcomes Taxpayers' Suggestions, Organizes Subcommittee to Investigate

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Administrative and Economic Special Committee was established in accordance with the seventh resolution passed by the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in April of this year, it has been divided into groups to investigate the current administrative organization of the Shanghai Municipal Council, whether it can implement frugality, and whether it can reduce expenditures and consolidate the financial foundation. It is now known that the committee has conducted investigations on the current administrative institutions, such as the police, fire, education, and health departments, as well as the financial status of each department, and may have submitted advisory reports. The committee's work has now advanced to the study of the sources of financial revenue of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The committee attaches great importance to this work and has designated six members to form a subcommittee to conduct investigations and research. It has also asked the Shanghai Municipal Council to disclose this news so that taxpayers in the area who are concerned about the finances of the Shanghai Municipal Council can make suggestions for reference.

It stated that U.S. Navy Seaman First Class Bennett, after getting drunk, was led into the entrance of the Japanese military police barracks by a woman, purely by mistake, as he recognized the Japanese military police barracks as a hotel. He was very sorry for the inconvenience caused by this misunderstanding. U.S. naval officials stationed in Shanghai have recently confirmed that this letter was indeed issued, but it was a "spur-of-the-moment"

note written on the spot.

After the Japanese authorities announced the contents of the above letter this morning, they stated that they considered the matter to be over. However, a Japanese official said that the Japanese authorities were quite indignant about the San Francisco radio broadcast's claim that this incident was a direct "anti-American attack" launched by the Japanese side. It is heard that a Japanese naval officer boarded the USS Augusta this morning to visit the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet,

Admiral Hart.

The details of the meeting have not been disclosed, but it is heard that what was discussed was related to the incident of the American sailor being assaulted. A U.S. Navy spokesman recently told reporters that the U.S. naval patrol officer took the initiative to apologize on the spot, but it was later determined that the U.S. Navy had no reason to apologize for the assault on the sailor.

### British Residents Relieve London Disaster Victims, Remitted Two Batches of Donations

British residents in the port, in order to relieve London from the bombings, specially responded to the London Mayor's appeal for donations to relieve the London blitz. They remitted 25,000 pounds last month, and the second batch of British gold, 1,565 pounds, was also wired to the London Mayor on the 1st for the purpose of helping civilians affected by the air raids, focusing on the affected people in the London disaster area. British residents in the port plan to raise funds to order several fighter planes to enhance air defense equipment. The donation matters are currently being assisted by the British Consulate General and the British Residents Association.

### Chung Hua Jih Pao, Someone Throws a Bomb

The kitchen and back door of the Chung Hua Jih Pao newspaper office at No. 59 North Henan Road (i.e., the original site of the former Commodity Exhibition Hall) are both located in a small alley. At around 9 o'clock last night, a man carrying a bomb walked into the alley, reached the back door of the building, took out the bomb, and threw it through the kitchen window of the building, landing next to the typesetting room, but it did not explode. Later, the newspaper office reported it to the police station, which immediately sent a large number of detectives to investigate and conducted a thorough search in the vicinity, but the bomber had already escaped into the crowd. The bomb was later taken back to the police station for destruction. The police station is conducting a thorough investigation into the source of the bomb.

### Hindering Shanghai-Zhejiang Shipping, Even Sailing Boats are Detained

Recent news from the Zhejiang side in Shanghai said that several large sailing boats were detained on their way to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and one was burned after being detained. Therefore, many sailing boats moored in Shanghai have decided to postpone their departure. As for the Renli, a large sailing boat loaded with goods that sailed out of the Yuxing Wharf at the 16th Pier at 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, it turned back to Shanghai because it heard that the journey was unstable. The goods loaded have all been unloaded and put on the pier.

### Young People Requesting Job Introductions Must Receive Appropriate Training

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section report for September, in the past nine months, the section has tried to introduce jobs to young people, all of whom were sent by various agencies. According to experience, these young people must undergo a considerable period of training. In the past, the total number of young people introduced to jobs was 150, but only 82 are currently working in factories. They should be ordered to continue to make up lessons. 58 factory apprentices were sent to the night schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council for remedial classes.

### French Merchant Labor Dispute Remains Stalemated; Mediator Agrees to Further Mediate; Labor Representatives' Negotiations Yesterday Yielded No Results; Water and Electricity Supply Within the Settlement Poses No Issue

Following the strike on September 25th by the tram workers of the French Tramway Company, demanding improved treatment, the workers presented six provisional preconditions, requesting Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng to mediate.  After a trial mediation the day before failed to reach a satisfactory resolution, Mr. Yu agreed to mediate further, seeking an early resolution to maintain traffic and security within the Settlement. He also hoped that the company would quickly seek a reasonable solution.  As for the striking workers, they have resolved not to resume work until the six conditions are met.  It is reported that they appealed to all sectors yesterday, requesting them to uphold justice.

Labor Negotiations Still Yield No Results

To seek a swift resolution to the labor dispute, workers from the tram, bus, and engine room sections of the French Water and Electricity Company again sent two representatives, Lu Zhongsheng and Zhang Wenzhong, to the Water and Electricity General Company on Route Paul Henry/ Avenue Dubail at 2 PM yesterday. They visited the company's General Manager, Favre, requesting negotiations with the management on the issue of resuming work. However, as of 6 PM, the labor representatives had not yet returned to report. Therefore, the progress of the negotiations remains unknown.

Formal Negotiations Have Not Yet Begun

According to Favre, the company received yesterday the first set of demands from the workers since the strike began last week. According to Mr. Favre speaking to reporters, the presentation of these demands was "unofficial." Formal negotiations have not yet taken place. He stated that because these demands were presented unofficially, the conditions of the demands cannot be disclosed. However, Chinese newspapers have already disclosed these demands.

Most Engine Room Workers Have Resumed Work

Although the dispute between the engine room workers and the White Russian staff of the French Water and Electricity Company was resolved the night before, labor representatives claimed that some workers had not yet returned to work. Yesterday afternoon, a Western staff member from the engine room, Ottard, along with a Chinese employee, Su Songlin, went to the home of engine room worker Wang Lishan at 17 Xianghua Bridge, Xifahua Town, ordering the striking workers to resume work immediately, or the company would dismiss them all.

Water and Electricity Supply Will Not Be Interrupted

Yesterday, according to a senior official of the Water and Electricity Company speaking to reporters, after an unfortunate incident occurred between the entire workforce of more than two hundred engine room workers and the Russian staff the day before, the strike occurred because the dispute arose from a misunderstanding, so it was not very serious and the solution was easy to proceed. A portion of the workers have already returned to work at the plant, and although a portion of workers have not yet immediately resumed work, the authorities deeply believe that it can be resolved soon. Because of the good relationship between labor and management in the past, they will definitely not go to extremes due to this slight misunderstanding.  However, since the water and electricity incident affects the safety and security of the entire society, the company will do its best to maintain the supply and will never allow for any interruption. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will not be overly disturbed, so as not to affect the security of the Settlement.

### Street Flooding Gradually Recedes; Weather Clears Today; Desilting Work Neglected, Impeding Drainage; Low-Lying Areas Still Flooded Above Ankle Yesterday

The cause of this massive flooding in Shanghai was the combination of high tides meeting with winds, coupled with torrential rain. However, the fact that the street flooding persisted for two days without receding was due to the neglect of desilting work, preventing effective drainage. The dredgers of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau were forcibly taken away by the Japanese side during the outbreak of the Songhu Battle in 1937. Although some have been returned after repeated negotiations between the Dredging Bureau and the Japanese authorities, many are still being withheld. Although the Dredging Bureau's dredging work has made slight progress in the past few months, it is far from the performance during normal times. It is reported that the Dredging Bureau is continuing to negotiate with the Japanese authorities to recover all the dredging equipment.

Alert Cancelled

The English-language *China Press* reported that the typhoon threatening Shanghai passed over the city towards the northeast between 3 and 4 AM today (the 2nd) and entered the sea northwest of Gutzlaff Island. According to information this morning, the center of the typhoon was within 32 degrees north latitude and 123.60 miles east longitude, which is 30 miles northeast of Wusong. The black typhoon signal ball suspended on top of the Jianghai Customs House was removed at 9:45 AM this morning. However, the flooding in various parts of the city will not recede immediately because it is expected that there will be another high tide at 2 PM this afternoon.

Heavy Rainfall

According to the Xujiahui Observatory, Shanghai received 10.44 inches of rain from midnight on Monday to midnight on Tuesday. The amount of rainfall from 7 PM on Monday to 7 PM on Tuesday was 8.12 inches. The Xujiahui Observatory also predicts that the weather may clear up tomorrow (the 3rd). The water level of the Huangpu River reached 14 feet and 3 inches at 12 PM tomorrow night (the 1st), setting a new record high.

Flooding Situation in Various Areas

Only Avenue Foch and Avenue Edward VII remained passable in the city after the flood, becoming thoroughfares for traffic. Avenue Foch east of Route Mercier was completely free of flooding, and Avenue Edward VII was entirely dry. Vehicles could also pass through the western section of Avenue Foch without any obstruction. However, the intersection with Seymour Road had deep flooding. West of Avenue du General Mangin and Haig Road, flooding formed canals. The section of Bubbling Well Road from Hart Road to Yu Qiaqing Road was also affected by flooding. Shops along Bubbling Well Road did not pile up sandbags in advance, resulting in losses due to water damage. The Welfare Company at the corner of Park Road had 9 inches of water in the lower level. The lower-level stores of Sincere Company were unable to operate. Wing On and The Sun performed better and were able to operate as usual. Although some areas of Broadway and East Seward Road had flooding one foot deep, traffic in Hongkou was still running as usual. In the Nanshi districts, the electricity supply was cut off due to the destruction of power lines by the typhoon, plunging the areas into darkness. At the same time, the water supply was also cut off, and it was not restored until around 8 PM the night before. Some schools within the Settlement temporarily suspended classes, but most held classes, and absences were not counted. The First Special Court was flooded with more than two feet of rainwater both inside and outside the building yesterday morning due to its low elevation. Civil servants and litigants entering and leaving the court were barefoot. Criminals were also transported directly from prison vehicles to the court to which they were supposed to be delivered without being detained in the detention room yesterday.

### Picture of Boating

Yesterday, the sky over Shanghai was overcast, and the heavy rain had stopped, but the flooding on the roads could not be drained, and pedestrians wading through the water were still submerged above the ankle. Although there was no attack by wind and rain, traffic was obstructed, and the short distance seemed like ten thousand miles. The cars traveling among them stirred up waves, and the sound of the tide could be faintly heard underfoot. The picture shows the flooding on Route Mercier in the French Concession, where an American sailor is boating with a Western woman. The boatman is rowing, and passers-by are watching from the side, creating a strange sight. It is truly a rare sight in Shanghai for decades to see boats on land.

### Suggestion to Cast a Bronze Statue of Yu Qiaqing

Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the naming of Yu Qiaqing Road. The Ningbo Association received a letter from permanent director Zhang Yanzhang yesterday, which read: "To the esteemed Ningbo Association of Shanghai, respectfully, Mr. Yu Qiaqing is a leader in the business community and is unmatched in his enthusiasm for social causes. I, Yanzhang, am young and have witnessed this personally for the past twenty-five or six years.  For example, in recent years, his achievements in rescuing the chicken farmers and stabilizing rice prices have been remarkable. In addition, during the recent labor disputes in major factories and public buses and trams, Mr. Yu, along with Mr. Yuan Ludeng and others, painstakingly mediated and ultimately succeeded.  In short, countless people depend on his survival, and countless matters rely on his ability to solve difficulties. There are those who directly benefit from his kindness, and there are those who indirectly benefit from his kindness. There is truly no way to fully express this.  Now, according to my humble opinion, I would like to ask your association to join with the Chamber of Commerce and other sectors to jointly initiate the casting of a bronze statue of Mr. Yu and erect it in the public concession at Mud City Bridge (i.e., between Yu Qiaqing Road and Beijing Road). This would highlight his merits and create a model for future generations. This would be the best way to inspire future generations to emulate Mr. Yu, which would be a crucial measure for benefiting society. The expenses can be collected from various sectors, groups, or individuals at will. If this can be implemented, I, Yanzhang, as the most junior member of the community, would also be honored.

### Cost of Living Index Rises Again in September; Workers' Lives Become Increasingly Difficult; Actual Income of Entire Family Is Limited; Rice Prices Are Higher Than Ever Before

The following figures represent the head of household's income, other family members' income, and the actual income of worker families. The term "actual income" refers to wages and all allowances. These figures are based on a study of worker families' income and living expenses in September. The following figures show two assumed levels of living:

The first type (i.e., Living Level A) assumes a level lower than in 1936; the second type (i.e., Living Level B) is a minimum standard of living (unit: yuan).

Note: This index is compiled based on the living standards of workers before the war in 1936. Recently, due to rising costs and declining living standards, in September of this year, in terms of the cost of reduced living standards, it increased by 3.51 times compared to before the war.

### Wu Gaoyou Murder Case; Three Criminals Confess the Process; Principal Culprit Zhu Gengshui Is Still at Large; Zhu's Father Had a Deep Feud with the Deceased

Wu Gaoyou, a 52-year-old Suzhou native, lived at 59 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. He earned a living wrapping waste paper at the *Sin Wan Pao* newspaper office and had considerable savings. At around 10 PM on the afternoon of the 25th of last month, he was smoking opium at home when he was suddenly slashed to death with a knife. Afterwards, the police station sent Detective Wu Helin to investigate, but there were no leads. It was not until the 26th of last month that it was discovered that Wu Gaoyou was killed by his son, Wu Guoliang (25 years old this year), in collusion with Zhu Gengshui and Pan Ada (25 years old this year, a native of Suzhou, living at 27 Changxing Lane, Wangzhi Road, Route Tenant de la Tour, a dung collector). Wu Guoliang, Wu's wife, Wang (27 years old, a Suzhou native), and Pan Ada were arrested, while Zhu Gengshui had already fled upon hearing the news.

Incident Process

After a detailed investigation by the police station, Wu and the other three were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday afternoon. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang stated that the defendants were arrested for a murder case. As the investigation was not yet complete, he requested an extension. Detective Wu Helin Chen Yuan then described the cause of the case, stating briefly: "At around 10 PM on the afternoon of August 15th of this year, the Avenue Joffre Police Station reported to the Detective Division that someone had been hacked to death by thugs at 59 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre. I was dispatched to investigate and learned that the victim's name was Wu Gaoyou."

Principal Offender at Large

"At the time of the incident, he was smoking opium, but his son and others remained silent and did not express any opinions, so there were no results. Later, on September 26th, it was reported in secret that this case was actually because the deceased's son, Wu Guoliang, could not bear his father's abuse and colluded with Zhu Gengshui to buy Pan Ada for 600 yuan. After the fact, Pan Ada was extorted 280 yuan by thugs and actually received 320 yuan. Based on the report, the police station immediately arrested Wu Guoliang and Pan Ada. Wu's wife, Wang, was also arrested because she also participated in the planning. However, the principal offender, Zhu Gengshui, escaped and could not be arrested."

Building of Hatred

"Pan Ada confessed that this matter was done entirely by Zhu Gengshui alone. Although I went with Zhu, I did not do anything. The deceased was slashed twenty or thirty times. According to Zhu Gengshui, his father used to work at the *Sin Wan Pao* newspaper office and was persuaded by Wu Gaoyou to quit his job. Later, his father returned to his hometown and died of illness. The newspaper office issued 1,000 yuan, which was embezzled by Wu Gaoyou. Therefore, Zhu hated him to the core and wanted to kill Wu Gaoyou at all costs, so he resorted to this tactic. Zhu Gengshui and I are cousins. Although he invited me to participate, I was afraid and ultimately did not actually participate."

Wu Guoliang's Confession

"Wu Guoliang confessed that Wu Gaoyou was my father, my mother died early, and I have a stepmother. My father lived in the front building, and I lived in the pavilion. My father usually treated me not badly. A week before the incident, Zhu Gengshui came to me and said that his father and my father had a feud over the *Sin Wan Pao* newspaper office business. Recently, Zhu Gengshui wanted my father to introduce him to a job, but my father refused, and he hated him even more, wanting to kill my father at all costs. I advised Zhu Gengshui at the time that this should not be done, but Zhu Gengshui was very determined and told me not to interfere and that he would bear all the responsibility. Later, on August 15th, Zhu Gengshui did do this thing."

Discord Between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law

"However, my wife, Wang, learned about this matter beforehand and had discussed it with Zhu Gengshui because Wang had a son (five years old) and a daughter (three years old), and my father did not pay for any expenses, causing a poor relationship between my stepmother and daughter-in-law. When Zhu Gengshui started, he came in from the back door, so I didn't know anything. When the police station received the report and came to investigate, the murderer Zhu Gengshui had not yet escaped and was sitting downstairs. However, Zhu threatened me and forbade me from speaking out, or else it would be bad for me, so I did not report the arrest of Zhu to the detectives." Lastly, Wu's wife, Wang, confessed that Wu Gaoyou was my father-in-law and was killed by someone Zhu Gengshui hired.

Wu Wang's Confession

"On August 15th, Zhu Gengshui said to me that because my father-in-law did not recommend him for business, he wanted to beat him to death. I said that this should not be done. Although I am not on good terms with my father-in-law and hate him very much, my conscience would not allow me to kill him. Therefore, I advised Zhu Gengshui not to kill my father-in-law. If he wanted to vent his anger, he could beat him up. Unexpectedly, he actually slashed my father-in-law to death. This matter has nothing to do with me." The court verified the confessions and, because the police department had not yet prosecuted and the case was unusually complex, requiring detailed investigation, ordered the case to be postponed until 2 PM on October 11th for further hearing. The three defendants were returned to custody.

### Robbers Steal Car; Original Car Found in Hongkou

At approximately 6:45 AM yesterday morning, two customers at the Renji Road Yunfei Car Rental Station in the Public Concession went to hire a car. The accountant dispatched driver Yao Lan to drive car number 12275 to Anhe Temple Road in Huxi. Unexpectedly, the two passengers in the car drew out guns and forced the driver to get out of the car. One person stood by and watched, while the other drove away. After about an hour, the driver was released and reported the car theft to the police station. The purpose of the robbers stealing the car is currently under investigation. The car was later found on O'Kai Road in Hongkou.

### Robbers Intercept Woman; Bite Off Finger; Two Robbers Flee Without a Trace

At approximately 8 AM yesterday morning, a middle-aged woman was passing by the YMCA entrance on Avenue de Montigny, Fa Concession. It was drizzling at the time, and the woman was walking along with an umbrella when a gold ring on one of her middle fingers was spotted by criminals. Two robbers approached, one grabbing her around the waist and the other trying to pull off the gold ring on her hand. Because she resisted, the robber became desperate and bit off a portion of her finger, seizing the gold ring and fleeing into Hengmao Lane across the street. The woman's hand was covered in blood, and she shouted for someone to catch the robbers. The nearby postmen heard the news and rushed to the scene, but the robbers had already escaped far away.

### Using Coercive Means to Pluck Pig Bristles; Slaughtering Company Unable to Bear Harassment; Six Criminals Arrested After Reporting to Police

The Su Xi Slaughtering Company, located at 50, Lane 1040, North Chengdu Road, specializes in pig slaughtering. Since the 10th of last month, a man named Li Haosheng and more than a dozen Chinese men and two Japanese men have been going to the company every day to pluck pig bristles by coercive means. The company's losses each day are no less than 100 yuan or more. However, because Li and the others were accompanied by Japanese men, they dared not resist. However, as this constant loss was unbearable, they had no choice but to report it to the New Gate Police Station. At 4:30 PM on the afternoon before yesterday, the police station ordered detectives to investigate. Unexpectedly, Li and the others came again and were arrested by the detectives, including Li and his accomplices Wang Asan, Zhao Ruirong, Lu Ziwan, Shi Depei, and Yin Amao. They confessed that they were instructed by Ge Shenglin and that the plucked pig bristles were sold to the Yixing Pig Bristle Company in Hongkou. The Japanese men who went with them were also dispatched by the Yixing Company, etc. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the process and requested permission for temporary detention for investigation. After interrogating them, Judge Zhong Qing ordered that the criminals be detained for a week for further hearing.

### Ma Chen Abuses Maid; Sentenced to a Fine of 50 Yuan; Victim Sent to Jiliang Institute

Ma Chen, a woman from Suzhou living at 22, Lane 110, Longmen Road, bought a maid named Feng Gendi (11 years old this year) in her hometown two years ago for 100 yuan. Because of carelessness in her work, she was often beaten and scolded by Ma Chen, or deprived of food. As a result, she became ill over time, resulting in a sallow and thin complexion. Yesterday, because she broke a spittoon, she was severely beaten by Ma Chen with a thin bamboo pole, leaving her covered in bruises. Feng Gendi had no choice but to endure the pain and escape. She wandered and cried in the area of Dagu Road and Mohawk Road. The Xibutou Fangteer and Chinese constable Zhang Ziqing of the Old Gate Police Station received a report and immediately rushed to Dagu Road to send Feng to the hospital for examination. Her buttocks and shoulders had stick injuries, and her nutrition was also insufficient. Fangteer then led Feng to her mistress's address and arrested her. Yesterday, she was sent to the First Special District Court and charged with abuse. After questioning by Judge Liu, Ma Chen was found guilty of injuring another person's body and was fined 50 yuan. The victim was handed over to the Jiliang Institute for care.

### Obstructing Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce; Liu Xiangyuan Fined

The Xiangyuan Factory, established by Liu Xiangyuan, a Ningbo native, at 15 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, recently imitated the Tianchu MSG product "MSG" with a product called "Wei Jing," and its decoration, color scheme, and hall style were all imitated from the style of "MSG" in an attempt to deceive and confuse. It was discovered by the Tianchu Factory, which hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Qian Xingzhong to report it to the Old Gate Police Station, which ordered detectives to raid the factory and seize more than 8,000 large and small empty tins and 353 filled tins. After hearing the case in the First Special District Court, Liu Xiangyuan was found not guilty. The Municipal Council, dissatisfied with the ruling, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court through lawyer Gan Zhongxian. After the interrogation was concluded, the original ruling was overturned. Liu Xiangyuan was found guilty of obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce and was fined 200 yuan. If he converted it to labor service, it would be calculated at 2 yuan per day. The seized full and empty tins were confiscated as per the list.

### New Autumn Racing News

With the first breeze of autumn, the Shanghai Race Club has recently been busy preparing for the autumn races. It is reported that starting this Saturday (October 5th), the club will kick off the first act of the autumn races. To enhance the interest in horse racing, there have been new developments in the analysis of the horses' rankings. For example, if a horse excels at short distances, it will be ranked as Grade A for short distances; if it excels slightly less at medium distances, it will be ranked as Grade B; and if it excels even less at long distances, it will be ranked as Grade C. The assessment is based entirely on past performance. Therefore, the same horse may have different performances in different distances and may be ranked in three different grades. If the performance is slightly different in the three distances, it may be ranked in two different grades. If the performance is similar in the three distances, it may be ranked in the same grade. This is a novel and groundbreaking method. It is expected that the races will be more exciting and that the audience will welcome it greatly, increasing their interest in research. The club's autumn grand lottery tickets have also begun to be sold. The method is the same as in the spring, with each full sheet having 11 strips and costing 10 yuan in national currency. Each strip costs 1 yuan, and the first prize is as much as 196,000 yuan. The drawing date is fast approaching. The number of tickets is limited, so buy them quickly.

### Dangerous Situation, Great Difficulties Ahead. Smoking Compatriots, How Precarious Your Position! Advice from One Who Hates Opium

— Du Ying

Lie Down and Think, Sit Down and Talk, Get Up and Act

In this era of turbulent times, impending crises, difficult living, exorbitant land prices, and thorns everywhere, smokers can no longer afford to drift and deceive themselves. Thinking of the current hardships and future dangers, they should quit as soon as possible, restore their health, reduce their expenses, and gradually improve and adapt to the times, seeking to quit without using needles. Relying entirely on more than a decade of rich experience, catering to each person's constitution, and using noble medicines and mysterious changes, people can break free from addiction imperceptibly. When Doctor Lai administers the treatment, he increases appetite, facilitates bowel movements, ensures sound sleep, and revitalizes the spirit. Addicts will not relapse after quitting. To gain the trust of those seeking treatment, Doctor Lai of Gongjian Hospital can first prescribe medicine for a trial period. If they are satisfied, they can then formally administer the treatment. Therefore, Gongjian Hospital and Doctor Lai Gongliang are the shores that smokers cannot fail to reach. (Gongjian Hospital Address: 208 Baker Road, British Concession, Telephone: 95111)

### Traveler Jumps to His Death from Sixth Floor of International Hotel

At 3:15 AM yesterday (the 2nd), a traveler in Room 614 on the sixth floor of the International Hotel on Bubbling Well Road, in his thirties, jumped from the window and committed suicide. He fell onto the corner of Bubbling Well Road and Park Road, his skull shattered, and died on the spot. When the traveler jumped, he was wearing a white suit, shirt, and trousers, and yellow new leather shoes. Although an ambulance quickly sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, he was too severely injured to be saved. It is reported that the traveler went to the room at 11 PM on the night of the 1st and claimed his surname was Song.

### Yunnan-Burma Road to Open Soon; New Posture of Unity Between Britain and the United States

The English-language *China Press* commented that Britain's re-opening of the Burma Road this month is still a matter of speculation, but that opening is only a matter of time, there is no doubt. If this important route is closed for more than three months, it will be truly shocking. Recently, the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards Japan's demands have become stronger than before. Since the United States lent China 25 million US dollars, there has been a new sense of unity between Britain and the United States. To say that Britain will continue to close the Burma Road and destroy this new feeling with another "appeasement" posture toward Japan is truly unimaginable. Japan may try to make the future use of the Burma Road more difficult, as Japan's use of air bases in Vietnam makes it more convenient to bomb Kunming and other parts of Yunnan than before. However, given that the Canton-Hankou Railway has been able to operate smoothly in the past under similar difficulties, the Chinese side is seeking to use this experience. If, after the Burma Road is reopened, some new anti-aircraft guns are added to protect important bridges and trails, it will be a particularly intelligent tactic. Since Japan has colluded with Germany and Italy and entered into a military alliance, Britain should at least maintain its genuinely neutral policy toward China and Japan. There seems to be no other choice. This is what the current situation allows. However, what Japan wants is certainly different. In Tokyo's attitude, any country that does not agree with its policy of aggression in Asia is considered a country that opposes Japan. Therefore, there is no doubt about the stance that countries such as Britain and the United States should take. Since these countries oppose the policy of aggression, they should at least not assist in the aggression.

### Letter Received

To Whom It May Concern:

We are instructed by our client, Madam Zhou Mei Yi-hui, to forward for your perusal the news item published in the local news section of your newspaper on the 30th regarding the case of Zhou Pengling suing our client for twenty-three leather trunks. We also wish to state that since the passing of Zhou Pengling's parents, Zhou Weibin has been his guardian, and his guardian has further appointed lawyers Luo Jiaheng and Peng Jie as liquidators to settle his creditor and debtor matters. His property is therefore managed by his guardian. The news item stated that his late father and he himself should inherit property subject to the disposal of others, which is without foundation. As for the deposit of trunks and offsetting debts, these matters were all personally handled by her late husband, Zishan, in Japan ten years ago. As Yi-hui was not involved, she naturally cannot understand the facts of the matter until a detailed investigation and counter-evidence are obtained. How can it be said that she is being evasive? Since the passing of her late husband, Zishan, Yi-hui has had no income, and she struggles to make ends meet, which is well known to friends and relatives. How could she have assets worth millions? Now that this matter has been litigated, whether our firm intends to embezzle or whether there is another story will be fairly judged by the court in the future. Such inaccurate reporting is clearly misleading and should be corrected. Therefore, we urgently communicate the situation and request a prompt correction.

Respectfully,

Lawyers Lu Shaozong and Shen E

Respected Editor:

Having read the correction notice from the French Tramway Company in today's newspaper, I also have further corrections to make. I have excerpted my experiences and injuries below, and I hope that the editor will publish them in the newspaper. I would be extremely grateful.

On September 27th, at approximately 11:30 AM, my mother and I were riding the No. 2 tram from the west to the east on the Avenue Dubail. When passing the station at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue du Père Huc, several rioters threw glass bottles filled with phosphorous-containing, highly flammable chemicals into the car. Immediately, the car filled with thick smoke, which then turned into a large fire. At this time, the car was in chaos, and passengers scrambled to escape. My mother fell from the car in the confusion and injured her hands and feet. Unfortunately, I was splashed with the chemical, which ignited my clothes and feet. My mother, in a state of panic, extinguished the fire on my body. Subsequently, the French Concession police and authorities summoned an ambulance and sent me to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Upon arrival, a foreign doctor applied medicine and bandages. Because my feet were severely burned, I had difficulty walking, so I am still hospitalized. Unfortunately, in the chaos, I lost a bag of clothing worth over two hundred yuan, stolen by unscrupulous individuals taking advantage of the fire. This unprovoked physical injury and material loss is truly heartbreaking. Now, the French Tramway Company is correcting the story to say that a woman suffered a foot abrasion while escaping. As for the report in your newspaper that shrapnel was flying everywhere, this is not factual. The French Tramway Company's statement that someone was scraped while escaping is even more inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, I am writing again to make corrections.

Sincerely,

Xu Qilan, the injured party (The newspaper published the surname as Qian, which is a homophone.)

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The first annual meeting of the members of the Chinese Cultural Association was held at 2:00 PM on September 25th at the Windsor Restaurant on the third floor. Hong Kong cultural figures gathered in one hall, a grand event indeed. The meeting was presided over by Li Yinglin and followed proper etiquette.

Jian Youwen reported on the work done over the past year. The association was initially proposed by eleven members of the Hong Kong cultural community last summer. Subsequently, leading figures in the cultural community were invited as promoters, and more than 110 people approved of the initiative. After the first preparatory meeting was held on September 3rd, nineteen preparatory members were elected.

### Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association Promotes Popular Education

Temporarily Establishes One School to Enroll Fifth and Sixth Grade Students (Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong Branch of the Overseas Chinese Education Association and the Kowloon Education Association, in order to promote popular education, specially organized a Popular Education Committee during Children's Day this year, electing twenty-five members including Zhang Lanzhou, Deng Zhiqing, Huang Yanqing, and Wang Shutao. The plan is to establish popular schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon to accommodate out-of-school children. It is understood that the association believes that this move is urgently needed. Currently, it is planned to first establish one senior primary school to enroll fifth and sixth grade students. Currently, the association is looking for a school site and plans to start classes this month. According to Deputy Director Deng Zhiqing, the popular school established by the association is currently planned to first establish one school. The school site will be selected in a convenient location in Central, or classrooms will be borrowed from a certain school. Enrollment can begin once preparations are complete. As for Wan Chai and Kowloon, the association will continue to establish more schools, planning to establish approximately twenty schools. However, it may be necessary to delay until next year to fully realize this plan. In terms of funding, each school is provisionally set at two hundred yuan per month. The source of funding will be the proceeds from flag sales held each year on Children's Day. The shortfall will be raised by the Education Association. The flag donation fundraising for Children's Day this year totaled more than three thousand yuan, which has been designated by the Education Association as funding for popular schools.

It is also understood that the Hong Kong Branch of the Overseas Chinese Education Association recently plans to find a new site in a convenient area in Central. According to reports, the association's current address is attached to the Hong Kong Bridge Middle School on Shelley Street. It is said that once the association moves to a new site, the popular school organized by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association will also be attached to the new site for classes.

### Schools Established by the Shanghai Municipal Council Continue to Suspend Classes for One Day Due to Unreceded Floodwaters

Classes will resume once the situation has returned to normal, and a notice will be issued.

According to reports, other schools in the city also suspended classes yesterday due to the inconvenience of students traveling back and forth due to the flood.

### Recent News from the Home Tutor Waiting Appointment Center

When the Shanghai War broke out, people in the education community immediately created the Shanghai Home Tutor Service. Although it was only temporary, the results were remarkable. Later, it was suspended due to changes in the situation, but most of the hired teachers have continued to work until now. In order to meet the needs of supply and demand, the teachers of the former service have gathered to organize a Home Tutor Waiting Appointment Center. The correspondence address is temporarily located at 450 Hart Road. Anyone who is a university graduate, enthusiastic about education, and experienced can first provide a detailed resume and expertise and send it to the center for introduction.

### Elementary Schools in the City Economize on School Supplies to Save Resources and Reduce the Burden

Since prices in the city have risen frequently and everything has become expensive, educational supplies have also risen day by day. The burden on the average parent has become heavier and heavier. Therefore, elementary schools in the city are all engaged in economizing on school supplies, such as making handicrafts by making the most of waste and stipulating that pencils, paper, and notebooks be used sparingly. At the same time, teachers tell stories about saving items and the difficulty of obtaining resources to encourage children to practice thrift. Educational groups in the city hope that all schools can implement this uniformly, which can not only save resources but also reduce the burden on students' parents.

### Children's Welfare Association Continues to Run Newspaper Boy Schools

In view of the need for education for newspaper boys, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association has continued to run four newspaper boy schools since July. More than 400 newspaper boys have enrolled, and with the support of all walks of life, the results have been quite effective. The funds needed by the school are provided by the association and donated by enthusiastic people from all walks of life who are passionate about social welfare. It is reported that the Yonggu Charity Association has been donating 200 yuan per month since August, the YMCA has donated 360 yuan, and Principal Zhang of Qingxin Girls' Middle School has donated 100 yuan.

It is also reported that the school plans to gradually expand if its financial resources permit, in order to popularize education for newspaper boys. It is said that they are currently planning newspaper boy boarding houses and winter clothing.

### Third Charity Basketball Challenge Match: Guoyou vs. Paramount, Still at the YMCA Tonight at 8:00 PM, Hoping that the Audience Strictly Observes Order

The third charity basketball challenge match, originally scheduled for Liangxi vs. Paramount, will now be changed to Guoguang Alumni Team. It is scheduled to be held at 8:00 PM tonight at the YMCA Gymnasium in Baixianqiao. Tickets are divided into two types: one yuan and two yuan. They went on sale a few days ago and it is said that many have already been sold, limited to 800 to maintain order. Those who have already purchased tickets for the Liangxi match should exchange them at the original point of sale before 5:00 PM this afternoon if they wish to switch to tonight's match. It goes without saying that Paramount has Li Zhenzhong, Feng Nianhua, Chen Xianglong, and others, and their strength is unquestionable. The Guoguang Alumni Team is the leader of men's basketball in Shanghai. Guoguang Team was praised as one of the three giants of men's basketball in the isolated island with Paramount and Hualian the year before last. Li Zude is good at dribbling and shooting, Qiu Xiaoci and Wang Nanqun are brave and fierce, and Chen Bangzhen's defense is as solid as gold. In addition, Bao Songyuan, who is currently under Paramount, was borrowed from Paramount by Qian Xucang, the main force of the Guoyou Team. Therefore, Songyuan has decided to serve his mother team today, which makes him even more powerful. The team has made a comeback for charity and practiced diligently to improve cooperation. Therefore, tonight's battle is expected to be fierce, and the wonderful and tense performance will be far better than the first and second matches. The game will still be auctioned off during the halftime break. I hope that the audience will appreciate the basketball skills as the premise and stop being picky and embarrassing enthusiasts. The good impression of this challenge event is also deeply rooted in Westerners. It is reported that the Giant Team, the champion of the Western Youth B Group in the previous session, also intends to participate in the event and challenge the Nanyang Team, the champion of the United Cup A and B Groups, and is already in contact. The Guoyou team members will gather at Dasiyuan on Nanjing Road at 6:00 PM this afternoon and set off together. The lineup of both sides is as follows:

(Guoyou Team) (Leader) Ye Zhenfei, (Officer) Guo Zhendong, (Coach) Qian Xucang, (Captain) Li Zude, Qiu Jici, Bao Songyuan, Chen Bangzhen, Wang Nanqun, Gao Baosheng, Fan Qingxian, Zhang Jinxuan

(Paramount) (Leader) Gu Liancheng, (Officer) Lu Zhonghui, (Captain) Chen Xianglong, Feng Nianhua, Jia Youliang, Zhou Zhi, Yu Dehai, Gu Senkang, Li Zhenzhong, Zhang Shaoqing, Gu Likang, Wang Jinghu

### Charity Volleyball Fan Letter Suggestion

We received a letter from Mr. Lu yesterday, which read, "Dear Editor, the recent charity basketball game was a sensation. Soccer and table tennis are also being launched. Interest in volleyball has also been very strong recently, and amateur volleyball has come to an end. The championships have all been won by Hushing, and the runner-up is Vivi. The women's championship of the Hongyi Cup was won by Vivi, and the runner-up was Hushing. From this point of view, the strength of the two teams is on par. I would like to suggest to your newspaper to launch a charity volleyball game. The women's team will be contested by Hushing and Vivi to determine who is the leader. The men's team can be contested by Hushing and Yinghua Ying. On the one hand, it can benefit the people in distress, and on the other hand, it can feast the eyes of those who love this. I don't know if you think so. Sincerely, Chen Jiazhen, October 1st, to the Sports News Editor of the Shenbao."

### Guangshi Cup Basketball Tournament Recent Situation of Each Group

The second Guangshi Cup Basketball Tournament has been held so far, and the eight games have been completed by the headquarters. Except for the "Shi" and "Xue" group champions, which have been won by Zhongchu and the Fei Team, Xinyou in the Guang group has won all four games and still has one game left against Laoyi. There is no problem with winning, so the championship is already stable. Luping in the Zhong group has also won all four games and still has one game left against Guoguang Nei, and the championship is almost a sure thing. In the Group B, Hushing has won all three games, and Hushing has won two games, and the Group Championship will be determined this weekend. In the women's group, Jingwu has won all three games, and the championship call is extremely high. Unfortunately, Qixiu lost to them by one point, but there is still a second cycle, and it is hoped that they can avenge them. If they can defeat Jingwu at that time, there is still hope of winning the championship. Guangshi and Lianyi in Group B have not been defeated, and the championship will be contested by the two teams. The entire situation of the game is explored as follows:

### Yinqian Cup Table Tennis Tournament Zikang Defeats Zhonghui Yesterday

In the Yinqian Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Zikang fought Zhonghui at the Zikang Table Tennis Room yesterday. Zhonghui arrived late and did not have time to practice, so they were unfamiliar.

The other two games, Siming and Jincheng, won. There are four games tonight, and it is expected that they will all become one-sided situations.

### Food Grain Imported Rice Source Never Stops Rice Merchants Claim There Is a Problem The Price of Imported Rice Rises by One Yuan New Japonica Rice Jumps to Eighty-eight Yuan

The imported rice is still shrouded in speculative air. Even though orders continue to be negotiated and goods continue to arrive in port, cargo owners, hoarders, and general operators are still doing their best to manipulate the market, spreading rumors that the rice that has been ordered may become a problem due to shipping issues, or that there may be changes. This has led to blind followers rushing to buy, and coupled with the weather, speculators are taking advantage of the opportunity, and taking over the afterglow of the day before yesterday, once asked, the shouts soared, and according to the trend at that time, it seemed that they had the general idea of going straight to the sky. However, as the price increased, although there was no sign of stopping it on the surface, there was inevitably some apprehension in the heart. As a result, the price of imported rice increased by half a yuan to one yuan, No. 1 Saigon seventy-five yuan and a half, seventy-five yuan, high-grade fire squeezed from seventy-four yuan, decided to seventy-two yuan, No. 2 Saigon sixty-nine yuan and a half, sixty-nine yuan, No. 2 Siam sixty-eight yuan, small squeeze around sixty-seven yuan, rice seal fifty-eight to ninety yuan, Yinghua Division original package recycled No. 1 Saigon, due to the rarity of goods, the market once had a shout of eighty-one to two yuan, but the inbound users disliked the high price and were not satisfied, and the current sales of imported rice were not strong, with less than four thousand bags traded.

Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Suiyang Wheel arrived in Shanghai, transporting 6,415 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at the company's dock in the French Concession for unloading. Today, there are 100 bags of corn being transported to Weihaiwei. (Ancestor)

The exchange of thick and thin japonica rice is like a pearl, extremely valuable, and the price continues to rise by one yuan. Changbang high japonica rice ninety-six yuan, decided to Su japonica rice ninety-three yuan, Nangang early rice bucket opened ninety-three yuan to ninety-one yuan and a half.

The same is true for new japonica rice, which increased by another three yuan, opening at eighty-eight yuan. Taicang new yangjian and Qingjiao new Dujian, however, have more inventory than new japonica rice, and their uses are also inferior, so the price has increased slightly by one yuan. Yangjian seventy-four to five yuan, Dujian seventy-seven yuan.

There were no arrivals of glutinous rice, whether domestic or imported. In the face of other goods booming, they have all risen in unison, one yuan better than before. Kaijin Li Te Yuan seventy-four yuan, Chang Dan goods seventy-two to three yuan, Hong Kong goods high from seventy-four yuan, decided to around seventy yuan. Glutinous tea flour blanks are selling well and are both one yuan better, selling for sixty-five yuan and a half, decided to sixty-seven yuan and three yuan and a half, a price of only sixteen yuan and five jiao.

### Foreign Flour Fixed at 2,000 Tons - Price Only $16.50

Flour prices remained steady yesterday. The No. 2 flour mill’s base price was fixed at $16.50. Apart from supplying the daily needs of this street, there were no large-scale wholesale transactions. The actual cost of imported wheat is very high, requiring a price of over $18. Therefore, the mill welcomes supplying out-of-town sales, but restricts retail sales on Wood Street, resulting in a perceived shortage of flour. However, the price of returned goods, old cart station orders, and foreign flour tightened once before yesterday. It was heard yesterday that merchants in this street had continued to fix 2,000 tons of Australian foreign flour at a price of only $16.50. Although not spot goods, it inevitably disheartens people. Furthermore, due to rainy weather and rising tides, the roads were almost turned into swamps, resulting in sluggish transactions, while the Municipal Bureau reported that prices are stable.

Wheat: Continued to be sluggish due to rain, and the trading of various grains was sparse. The supply in the concession area was even more desolate. Apart from the 100 bags of new wheat from Taicang handled by the inland agents the previous two days, there were no inquiries for out-of-town sales for the time being. Japanese and Chinese mills occasionally received scattered amounts, and the price was roughly the same as before.

### Finance: Hong Kong Banks Concurrently Sell British Gold and American Exchange

Yesterday’s foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC’s listed prices. The exchange rates for British and American currencies were mediocre, first slightly tight and then finally loose, allegedly due to the widely spread rumor of an economic severance between the United States and Japan. Although a certain foreign bank telegraphed for absorption in the early morning, Chinese speculators were quite willing to release funds. Furthermore, as Hong Kong telegrams continuously sold American exchange at favorable rates, the market presented a loose appearance. However, the closing price of $5.53125 was difficult to settle and sell, so the American exchange was not much different from the day before yesterday. Sterling was even cheaper, and the futures and spot prices were the same. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

A Sudden Shift to Looseness Midway

In the early morning, both near-term and far-term large London bars were flat, the price of silver in New York remained flat, and the price of gold in London remained unchanged. Exchange rates between Britain and the United States in Shanghai did not change, while the rate of the US dollar against the pound fell by .071875, against Shanghai by a small amount of .08, and there was no market for the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold at three ounces and five one-five six two five, and American exchange at five and a half yuan, both of which were flat compared to the evening close the previous day. After opening, due to telegraphic purchases from the Hong Kong National Goods Bank, and with a strong appetite, the market tightened. At that time, Chinese speculators sold American exchange for the current month at $5.46875 to Chinese and foreign banks. It was heard that the tightest rate had been seen at $5.4375. HSBC's listed prices were announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also announced without increase or decrease. Afterwards, the Hong Kong telegram sold sterling spot at a price of three ounces and a half to foreign banks, and also released American exchange for the current month at $5.46875 to a certain American bank and a British bank at a favorable rate. The underlying trend could be said to be stable. Approaching noon, there were no major changes. Chinese speculators continued to sell American exchange for the current month at five and a half yuan to foreign banks at favorable rates, but the closing price suddenly hardened, with British gold at three ounces and five one-five six two five, and American exchange at $5.53125. The prices for the current month and spot were the same. November British gold was at three ounces and a half, and American exchange at five and a half yuan. Compared to the previous day, the British gold futures and spot prices were the same, and the American exchange increased slightly by .03125. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Hong Kong, 2nd (Wednesday Telegram): The opening of the exchange market this morning was reported as flat. The spot price of British exchange remained unchanged, while the spot price of American exchange contracted by .125 to 23.3125 yuan. The spot price of Shanghai exchange rose by 2 yuan to 426 yuan. The spot price of Japanese exchange tightened by .5 yuan to 105 yuan and a half. At 9:35, it loosened slightly, and the spot price of American exchange rebounded by .125 to 23.4375 yuan. At 10:15, it was reported to be loose, and the spot price of American exchange continued to loosen by .0625 to 23.5 yuan. At 11:30, it was reported to be flat, and the spot price of Shanghai exchange fell back by 1.5 yuan to 424.5 yuan. The rest remained unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Tianjin British and American Tightening

Tianjin, 1st (Wednesday) Telegram: The opening of the exchange market this morning was reported as flat. The spot price of British exchange tightened by .03125 to three ounces and four .0625, and the spot price of American exchange contracted by .15625 to $5.3125. The "Joint Yarn" futures disk continued to rise by 3.5 yuan to 81.75 yuan.

### Gold Market Finally Unable to Hold - Breaks Through the $5,900 Level

Yesterday, the black market price of spot gold fell again, but the rate of decline was still slow. Many bulls were taking advantage of the lower prices and slightly adding to their positions. The price rose sharply in the morning due to the tight exchange market. Later, rumors spread that the United States would sever economic ties with Japan, and the foreign exchange market changed from flat to loose. The lack of encouragement from buyers caused hesitation, and ultimately, due to uneven supply and demand, the price broke into the 900 yuan level, with the lowest price reported at $5,850. The closing price was $5,855, which was $50 lower than the previous day's closing price. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. Half-day trading was still active, with more than 2,000 taels traded. Jewelry gold shops ultimately listed at $10 less. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Resulting in a Fall of Fifty Yuan

In the early morning, with foreign exchange reported as soft, the price surged sharply. Gold shops purchased ten taels of gold at $5,950, as the opening price, and securities firms immediately came to acquire it. It continued to rise by ten yuan, with securities firms acquiring twenty taels of gold at $5,960. Later, due to the joint release by gold and silver shops, the price eventually fell back. Gold shops sold thirty taels to silver shops at $5,930, but money changers intentionally bought it, and it was pulled up by several tens of yuan. Silver shops then acquired twenty taels from securities firms at $5,950. At that time, it was heard that foreign exchange was gradually becoming flat, and gold and silver shops continued to release, sharply pressing into the 900 yuan level. Domestic gold shops released twenty taels to securities firms at $5,885. Fortunately, due to the money changers and another silver shop increasing their bullish positions, it re-emerged from the 900 yuan level. Silver shops had a transaction of ten taels at $5,920. However, due to the dumping by securities firms, gold shops, and silver shops, supply could not meet demand, and the price continued to fall. Gold shops released ten taels to securities firms at $5,860. After a slight fluctuation, silver shops acquired twenty taels from securities firms at $5,880. Approaching noon, silver shops had a transaction of twenty taels, falling to $5,850, the lowest price of the day. In the end, gold shops acquired ten taels from silver shops at $5,855, as the closing price, which was $50 lower than the previous day. The selling price of spot gold shops was more than $10 higher than the black market price, while the purchase price was $30 lower. The current margin gold was listed at more than $50 lower than the listed price, and there were few openings. In jewelry shops, the exchange price for each tael of jewelry gold still hovered at $610 in the early morning. Towards noon, it was listed at $10 less, with major firms listing at $600, and new firms at a similar price to the above, with the purchase price being about $30 lower.

### Most Foreign Currencies Decline

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw black market prices rise and then fall, with British and American gold pounds also rising and then falling, ultimately dropping by one yuan. Demand for British gold notes was not weak, and the market price rose by .5 yuan. American gold notes initially rose to $18.13, but due to rampant rumors about the economic severance between the United States and Japan, the supply from all parties suddenly increased, and the market price fell. The evening market retreated to $17.80, ultimately falling by .2 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes had a slight demand, and the market price rose slightly by .01 yuan. The supply of Japanese gold notes did not decrease, and the market price continued to fall by .015 yuan. The evening market retreated to $1.46 yuan. Korean notes continued to be strong, and the evening market rose to $1.18 yuan.

### North-South Goods: New Cotton Jujubes Presented

The first batch of Tianjin cotton jujubes arrived, consisting of over forty packages. The appearance and color were quite impressive. Being the first time seeing new products, they were particularly rare. They were cleared in full at $60. More than twenty packages of red jujubes from the prefecture also arrived, with the prices set at $45.

### Interest Rate Reduction on Current Deposits

— Jie Xi

Tracing back to the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, banks in general suffered waves of bank runs at the time, and closed for several days. In view of this situation, the Ministry of Finance urgently promulgated measures to restrict withdrawals and deposits to stabilize the financial situation. At that time, banks had loaned a very large amount of money to industrial and commercial enterprises. It was not easy to demand repayment all at once, and those with deposits in the banks rushed to withdraw them. Even the cleverest housewife cannot cook without rice. Once the Ministry's order was issued, stability was achieved.

Subsequently, the war shifted westward, and residents in the interior were affected by the ravages of war. The propertied class continuously fled to Shanghai to seek refuge, and their funds also came with them. As a result, the use of these funds for bundling goods and hoarding, and speculating on foreign exchange, became widespread. Old depositors in banks became envious, and rushed to withdraw their deposits, leading to the subsequent "Ma Telegram" restriction order. At this time, after the maturity of long-term deposits, they were invariably converted into short-term (one or two years) and current deposits. The interest rate was not a consideration, but rather the desire for convenient liquidity and security of the principal. The total amount of checks paid out and transferred to foreign banks was shockingly large when calculated at the exchange. Foreign banks paid only 1 or 2 percent interest on current deposits, and only 1 percent or no interest on checking accounts. Although various harsh conditions were imposed, such as not accepting small deposits and reducing interest on large deposits, the Chinese people were willing to accept them. The fact that they did not haggle over the amount of interest showed the mentality of depositors in general.

In the past two years, funds have been moving to Shanghai, increasing daily. There are few appropriate objects for banks to lend to. Unlimited deposits lead to increased hidden costs for subsidized interest. Banks with status are unwilling to engage in risky speculation in foreign exchange and margin gold. Investing in safe foreign exchange arbitrage is favored by general current depositors. Interest rates are above 4 percent. Withdrawals are used for arbitrage. Interest rates are below 4 percent. They are redeposited to the bank for 4 percent current interest. As a result, the banks themselves, under enormous arbitrage, cannot make arbitrage because they need to prepare current deposit withdrawal balances. Although they can make arbitrage below 4 percent, slightly reducing the cost of interbank lending, the hidden costs are inevitable in the end.

Prices are rising steadily, and bank expenses are also increasing accordingly. How much is left from the difference between deposit and loan interest? Seeing that floating capital is not decreasing and current deposits are increasing daily, there have been discussions about lowering interest rates. After repeated joint discussions, the dates for implementation were set. The first to issue a notice was Zhejiang Industrial, followed by the Shanghai Bank. Today's newspaper reports that the savings association jointly run by China-South, Jin Cheng, Salt Industry, Continent, and that line is also reducing its current interest rate by 1 percent next month. It is not difficult to understand that banks want to consolidate their position and reduce hidden costs. It is hoped that depositors themselves will take the overall situation into consideration by promoting the conversion of current deposits to fixed-term and long-term deposits, so that funds can be fixed and easily moved inland.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds All See New High Prices - Foreign Stocks Extremely Quiet

Yesterday's securities black market was filled with rumors reflecting the sharp fall in Japanese government bonds. Investor sentiment became even more elevated. At one point, due to short covering and adding to long positions, the market prices of various bonds surged to new record highs, surpassing the highest prices on September 30th. Type A bonds broke through $6, Type B bonds approached the $60 mark, Type C bonds broke through $8, and Type D bonds also broke through $7. At closing, there was profit-taking from long positions, and the prices retreated slightly by two or three cents, but the situation was very good. Although market prices continued to advance, when compared to any commodities, gold, foreign exchange, or foreign stocks on the market, the disparity was stark. However, there are bound to be many twists and turns, and preparations must be made in advance. Yesterday's trend was initially weak in the morning and then strengthened. Type A bonds reached as high as $6. In the afternoon, buyers were very enthusiastic, and the market prices of various bonds rose all the way, reaching new highs. In terms of trading, No. 6 and Xin Fu had the best appetite. The remaining firms, such as Ding Kang, Tong Shun, Yi Tai, Jiu Fu, and general retail investors, were actively covering their short positions. However, Lian He released shares in the morning, and Tong Kang, Le Mao, Heng Kang, etc., also sold shares, so the closing price retreated slightly. In the end, the prices continued to rise by .1 or .2 to .4 yuan. The total volume traded was over $1.7 million. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock trading: 50 shares of Kang Yuan Canning Factory were traded at a price of $9.80.

Yesterday, the opening of the public stock market was quite stable, but gradually turned bleak afterwards. It was rumored that it was not yet time for Yi He shares to pay interim dividends, and at the same time, the development of the political situation was still uncertain. Market fluctuations were within a narrow range. Yesterday, the water in Japanese cities had not receded, and the writing rooms of various companies had very few customers. This was another reason for the quiet market.

London, 1st (Tuesday) Telegram: The listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British company stocks remained flat today. Bank stocks saw mixed ups and downs. Jardine Matheson Bank shares rose 2 shillings and 6 pence to £6.15 shillings. HSBC Bank (London Registered) shares fell £1.5 to £65.5, and Hong Kong Registered shares fell £1 to £71. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn & Cotton: Spot Yarn First Raised, Then No "Hat" to Grab

The yarn market rose and then fell, and the situation gradually entered a state of flux. This was because the price had risen by 200 to 300 yuan from the low point. A batch of profit-takers temporarily sold out to seek profit. However, some, due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials, were very optimistic about the outlook and were always unwilling to give up the amount they were absorbing. Therefore, the pulling by both sides was very dramatic. As for retail sales, Hong Kong brokers were still healthy in their appetite for 10-count coarse yarn, but other purchases were more sluggish.

Spot yarn opened in the morning due to the tight atmosphere in the afternoon of the previous day, and general long positions suddenly came to raise prices. The first trade was at $1,117. Unexpectedly, certain major players came out of their cages to release shares. However, the shout of buyers was still deafening, so the price of $1,110 remained for a long time. Later, it was heard that the entire city was flat and the foreign exchange was softening. The "hat grabbers" believed that there was no hat to grab, and the market was not very volatile. By the time of closing, it had fallen to $1,095. It was found that the half-day transaction statistics totaled 4,945 packages. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 5 yuan. The amount bought by each broker is listed separately on the left.

The situation of spot cotton is still calm. Factories have some needs, so people's hearts are still calm. However, with the extension of foreign exchange and the absence of a rise in the foreign cotton market, people's hearts are still mediocre.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was very quiet. Later, due to a portion of Wall Street's sales, the closing price fell slightly by one or two pounds. The Indian rupee fell by more than three rupees.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Trading has been very active recently, especially for long-staple fibers. All parties are well aware that the source of foreign cotton will be cut off, and the price of the overseas cotton market is higher than the price in Shanghai. The factory is competing to buy because the inventory of this raw cotton is not abundant, so the inventory is becoming increasingly scarce. It is generally expected that the cotton market will continue to rise sharply.

### Silk & Tea: Inland Silk Prices Surprisingly Cheap - Shanghai Can Look, But Cannot Connect

Yesterday, New York silk market spot prices were reported to be up, with Japanese silk at 85.75 cents, each rising by 8 cents. Near-term and far-term prices remained unchanged, allegedly due to the sharp stimulation of the Japanese-American political situation. Yokohama spot prices rose by 5 yuan, far-term March was not open for auction, December was 1404 yuan.

Yesterday, the local silk market showed signs of movement, but the amount of goods in hand was limited and the price was very firm. The current price for white factory 7/8 silk is $5,200, and special silk from Ji Li is $3,700. It is heard that foreign firms are willing to compromise, and it is hoped that they will be quite close. Furthermore, inland silk prices are surprisingly cheap. Due to the recent months of blocked silk shipments, white silk from Xidi is only around $3,200 - $3,500, but Shanghai cannot obtain it, and can only look but not connect.

### Hardware: Chinese and Indian Pig Iron Disappear - American Iron Rises to Replace

In addition to Liugou in China, India, and Russia, pig iron is now also being shipped from the United States. The output of our Chinese products has long been cut off (it has been interrupted since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, so no goods are shipped to Shanghai). The amount of Russian goods circulating in the market is very small, and there are few inquiries. Among them, the one that can take the place of Chinese goods is Indian pig iron. Therefore, at one point, the market asked for Indian goods, resulting in increasingly broad transactions. However, since the expansion of the European war, India's production of pig iron has not been enough to meet the military needs of Britain, so there is no spot supply to Shanghai. It is now known that the spot supply in the market is scarce, so pig iron produced in the United States has risen to the occasion, and spot shipments are continuously arriving. In this market where things are valued for their scarcity, the market is unusually high. First-class goods must be opened at $870 to $880, so actual sales are sluggish due to the high price. Weaving threads with the Tiger, Flying Crane, Tianxiang Xianhe and domestic broad and narrow raw camel wool patterns were all sold at $11.50 per yard yesterday. Wei Yi Double Deer brand fine camel wool sold for $7.25, plain colors for $6.50, stripes for $5.75, and miscellaneous brands sold for around $5 each, with leather ranging from $6 to $7. Most of the prices depended on the quality and color. In recent times, the market for these various broad and narrow camel wools has been falling sharply. The poor quality ones easily shed hair, and the thin quality ones cannot resist the cold. The good quality ones are too expensive, and each foot must be cut and sold for more than $2. The sales of wool have decreased by half compared to two or three years ago. The sales of silk, satin and imported goods are also far less prosperous than before, but the lack of transport for goods to and from other ports such as Sichuan and Northern China is also a major factor. As a result, large-scale camel wool manufacturers have turned to making wool, while smaller ones have gradually stopped operating.

### Piece Goods: 1,400 Pieces Transported to Yantai and Weihaiwei

There have been many piece goods transported north in recent days. Today, 110 pieces are being transported to Weihaiwei, and 1,100 pieces are being transported to Yantai.

### Sugar Market: This Factory's Ice Small Yuan Xu

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and slightly soft with some loosening. The guild's price fixing showed no significant changes in spot prices, with second-grade coarse white sugar remaining stable. Our company's price was 78.5 yuan, other companies' were 78 yuan, and transshipment goods were 61.9 yuan, a small yuan less than last week. Dutch Red Mark was 60 yuan, DY Mark was 59.6 yuan, Dutch Cotton White BS Mark was 75 yuan, and Taikoo Granulated White Sugar fluctuated only slightly. B Mark was 75.9 yuan, DY Mark was 73.9 yuan, HX Mark was 73.6 yuan. This factory's No. 1 Ice was 100 yuan, and Crystal Clear Ice was 101 yuan, both down by 1.5 yuan.

After the Incident, the Chinese silk industry immediately fell into extreme chaos. The final result was that Chinese-owned enterprises could not operate large-scale factories independently. Consequently, most of the workers engaged in sericulture were nearly left to starve. Later, silk factories in the Shanghai Concession were established one after another, and some workers were able to return to their former trades. However, tens of thousands of workers remained unemployed. Subsequently, small amounts of capital were pooled together to organize small silk-reeling workshops, each with about twenty reeling machines. Only then could the unemployed survive the difficult days after the war. During that year, business was relatively smooth due to low costs and reduced expenses. However, social order was not yet stable, and robberies were frequently reported in workshops in the surrounding countryside, making business quite challenging. Some were forced to shut down. As for the silk factories in the Shanghai Concession, they had sophisticated machinery and large scales, and the workers were able to work with peace of mind. At the end of the year, the profits were surprisingly high.

Last year, the sudden ban on the transport of dried cocoons caused the factories in the Concession to be unable to obtain raw materials, and they had no choice but to close down one after another. Only a small number of factories managed to transport dried cocoons from eastern Zhejiang to continue reeling silk. Most workers suffered the hardship of unemployment again. Later, they successively moved back to the interior. In order to make a living, they had to combine their resources and operate small silk-reeling workshops in a decentralized manner to overcome the difficulties. As a result, a surge of these workshops became popular for a time. In terms of business, the smooth overseas sales and the shortened exchange rates allowed silk operators to obtain unprecedented huge profits, but what we got was just leftovers.

### Overthrowing the Profit-Driven Education System: A Proposal for a New School System

— Xingzhi

Everyone hates the "commercialization of education." Teachers who are exploited under this system hate it, and even non-profit principals hate it. But what can be done? The government is distant, municipal schools are dissolving, and how can education be maintained without opening private schools? Yet outsiders indiscriminately denounce the commercialization of education in Shanghai, how can those who are genuinely enthusiastic about education not be saddened?

However, profit-driven schools do exist, and there are many of them. Under this system: parents are deceived, teachers are exploited, children are misled, and even we non-profit educators are greatly wronged. Therefore, for the sake of the future of education, for the sake of the practical benefits of citizens, and for the sake of the reputation of teachers, we must overthrow the profit-driven school system!

How can we overthrow it and build a reasonable system? The best way is to strike at the root. Therefore, we should observe the causes of the commercialization of education.

Undoubtedly, school administrators engage in profit-driven behavior because they are responsible for the school's financial gains and losses. We must first ensure that school administrators do not need to and cannot bear this responsibility. Then, the profit-driven system will naturally diminish, and administrators will strive to improve teaching without being stingy. Teachers' salaries will certainly increase, and children's happiness will certainly be achieved.

So, who should be given the economic responsibility of the school?

In my opinion: give it to the parents. Some might say that I am talking nonsense, but no, I have reasons:

(1) It can make teachers understand that they are responsible to the parents, not to money, and be extra diligent in teaching.

(2) It can make parents understand that teachers are experts hired to represent them in educating their children, changing the parents' psychology of belittling teachers and increasing parents' concern for the school.

(3) Those who have the closest relationship with the children's academic level are the parents, and teachers' salaries are closely related to the children's academic level. Letting parents be responsible for the school's finances may lead to them treating teachers better!

(4) Originally, schools were created after the division of labor in society, as agents for parents in educating their children, so it is theoretically appropriate for economic power to belong to the parents.

(5) It is enough to give the parents the full power over financial gains and losses. The parents allocate office expenses to the school on a monthly basis according to the budget, and the school uses this for expenses. The administrators can avoid worrying about insufficient expenses, and the parents will not be bothered.

(6) As long as the parents' meeting organization is sound, the powers and functions of the school and the parents' association are clearly defined, and it is stipulated that parents do not interfere with school administration, school administration can still be unified.

(7) Because the parents' association represents the interests of all parents, not just a few parents, the school can still handle children's discipline impartially.

(8) As long as the parents' association fully entrusts the principal and grants teachers appropriate terms of office, the classrooms will be able to work without any scruples and be loyal to their duties. Moreover, parents are mobile, while the teachers are the most familiar with the school, so teachers will know that they have strong protection and will be happy to work.

(9) For example, if tuition fees need to be increased due to soaring prices, the parents are the approvers of the budget and can understand the school's finances more clearly, and will be able to contribute generously without causing misunderstandings.

(10) Because the parents are the ones who pay the tuition fees, now that the expenses are made public to the parents, the stigma of a profit-driven education system can be avoided.

For the above reasons, I propose:

(1) Parents should organize an association, elect directors, and manage school finances. Teachers and staff only have the right to submit budgets and use office expenses.

(2) Teachers' salaries should be increased, and those with large families should be given subsidies. They should not be transferred arbitrarily without reason, and in terms of teaching, parents can only contribute principles and should not criticize or interfere at will.

(3) The parents' meeting should directly hire the principal, grant them full power over facilities, with a term of one, two, four, or eight years. Teachers and staff should be recommended by the principal and hired by the parents' meeting for a term of one year, in order to unify administration.

(4) Tuition fees should be determined by the parents' association based on the budget, with a slight addition. At the end of the semester, based on the final accounts, the remaining funds should be returned after deducting a portion for reserve funds.

(5) Start-up costs should be shared by all parents. Later parents should pay a certain amount of foundation money each semester. When students graduate or withdraw for some reason, they can recover a portion or all of the foundation money or start-up costs.

(6) Parents whose children have left the school should still be allowed to attend parents' meetings.

This is the outline of the method I have proposed. I believe that the profits of these profit-driven school owners are scraped from parents on the one hand and squeezed from teachers on the other. So, if we can overthrow them and implement this new system, teachers and parents will probably benefit somewhat!

I remember a friend telling me that the principal of their small school can make nearly ten thousand in profit each year. Please think about it, if this money were used for public purposes, how much equipment could be added, how much could teachers' salaries be increased, and how much could tuition fees be reduced!

### Cannot Agree

— Lin Huaying

After reading Mr. Yan Zheng's "My Wife's Sacrifice" in the August 17th issue of this column, and then reading Mr. Chen Ming's "Not a Sacrifice" on the 26th, I couldn't help but pick up my pen and write a few words.

I feel that Mr. Yan Zheng's ideal: "After marriage, both go out early and return late, each fulfilling their responsibility to the country and society" is also the ideal of most people. But in reality, she is "turning around in the vegetable market, the kitchen, and the bedroom, becoming a housekeeper," resulting in "a huge sacrifice." I express my great sympathy for Mr. Yan Zheng's feelings.

However, Mr. Chen Ming "does not consider it a sacrifice," believing that "managing the household and supervising children is also a career," and that a capable homemaker is saving the country in her own way. This seems a bit like Hitler's style of "women return to the kitchen and the bedroom," so it's no wonder that Mr. Chen Ming himself admits: "My wife's attitude certainly cannot represent all women."

Mr. Chen Ming believes that women going to the kitchen and bedroom is an "ideal family." In fact, there probably aren't many such "ideal families"! Because most women are feeling monotonous and bored with the life of the vegetable market - kitchen - bedroom and are not as "not considering it a sacrifice and not complaining" like Mrs. Chen!

According to Mr. Chen Ming, Mrs. Chen was originally a university student, skilled in debate and rich in organizational skills, and often held important positions in extracurricular activities, but after getting married and having children, she never participated in any group, and looking to the future, she will never participate in social activities again. Isn't it a pity that such a talented person as Mrs. Chen doesn't come out to "lead society" but goes to nurture little citizens? If China's 200 million women all abandon the cause of leading society in order to nurture healthy little citizens, wouldn't the country's strength be reduced by half? In this way, by the time the "little citizens" nurtured by the 200 million women become "citizens," the country will have perished, and they can only be "healthy slaves of a fallen country."

Of course, at present, women still need to wait for the society to become more perfect in order to completely break away from the shackles of the vegetable market - kitchen - bedroom, until social undertakings such as nurseries and public canteens are developed. But, Mr. Chen Ming does not consider the complete abandonment of social activities by Mrs. Chen, a talented leader, to be a sacrifice, which cannot be agreed upon.

Hawthorne's Investigation

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 8: Two People Caught

"You said they were originally as hot as fire, then why would Li Lan abandon him now and get to know someone named Zhao?"

The woman raised her eyes and glanced at Hawthorne and me, then lowered them a bit, as if hesitating, or as if she was a little shy. "I don't know about this, and I can't say anything. I'm also a little surprised. I've met that Mr. Zhao a few times. His character is neither as good as Little Yu, nor does he seem to have——"

"Have what?"

"Have——have——money." Her head drooped even lower.

Although she was such a rather depraved woman, she would actually show this kind of expression, which cannot but make me believe that Mencius's saying "everyone has a sense of shame and aversion" indeed has a psychological basis.

Hawthorne said again: "Then, what is the extent of Li Lan's relationship with that Mr. Zhao? Do you know?"

Anna shook her head and said: "I don't know. Li Lan never talked to me in detail about that Mr. Zhao. I only know that their acquaintance is still recent."

Hawthorne paused, and then suddenly asked: "Do you think that Mr. Zhao would kill Li Lan?"

Jiang Anna was stunned for a moment, raised her head, and asked in surprise: "Him? I don't know. I don't think he would, because they haven't known each other for long, and their feelings are certainly still very warm; and Li Lan broke up with Little Yu because of him. How could he kill her?"

Hawthorne nodded and said: "Yes, this is indeed a contradiction. But in fact, his suspicion is heavier than Little Yu's."

"Strange, Mr. Hawthorne, have you already met that Mr. Zhao?"

"I've met him. He even shot at me."

Jiang Anna showed a frightened expression again. "Oh dear! I'm so sorry, are you not injured?"

Hawthorne shook his head. "No, this person has now been caught."

Jiang Anna said: "That's great. Mr. Hawthorne, I don't have any preconceived notions. As long as the real murderer is caught and Li Lan's grievances are redressed, and at the same time, we dancers have a guarantee, that's fine. I only suspect Little Yu, it's just my guess."

Hawthorne said: "Then, apart from these two people, do you think there are any other suspicious people?"

Jiang Anna stared at the floor, as if trying hard to think, and for a while it seemed that she had no clue. (125)

### Darkness

— Lei Xing

We detest darkness, but we do not fear it; we expose darkness, but we do not exaggerate it.

This is an era of struggle between light and darkness.

Through the pitch black, we still see brilliance; we have a firm belief: darkness will surely pass, and light will eventually arrive. Ideals have given us courage and perseverance.

However, there are also many who are powerless to face the darkness squarely.

For example, there is a certain Mr. So-and-so who went to the mainland once, saw local corruption in politics, and returned to this isolated island to publish a series of comments; then he shook his head.

But, what a pitiful myopic person!

Our country has made so much progress in the past three years, and he can't see it—is he powerless to face the light squarely? He is frightened by the remnants of past bureaucratic politics. Of course, this is a very serious issue, but we must recognize its root and the inevitability of its cleansing.

We detest darkness, but we do not fear it; we expose darkness, but we do not exaggerate it. However, we must overcome darkness, and darkness will inevitably be overcome!

### "China" Special Correspondent Films Vietnam Newsreels

— Leng Bai

When we appreciate feature films produced by European and American countries, we can often see very precious newsreels at the same time. The subject matter of newsreels is to broadly report news from a certain place. In the past, they only focused on entertainment, but now, due to the urgency of the international situation, they are more inclined to international propaganda. For example, before the Da Hua Cinema screened "Ten Thousand Mile Expedition," there was a newsreel about air defense in London, which not only catered to the audience's interests but also increased the audience's knowledge of air defense.

Recently, the situation in Vietnam has been very tense, which is related to our country's war of resistance, so it has attracted the attention of the general public. Therefore, the China Film Studio specially dispatched Zhu Shuhong, a military education film photographer from the studio, to Vietnam to capture newsreels within the possible range. Indeed, it is a kind of mobile education for resisting Japan and building the nation.

Now, Mr. Zhu Shuhong has captured many scenes of our efforts to rescue materials along the Vietnamese border with a cautious and agile attitude and has already sent them to the general factory in Chongqing. The factory believes that it is satisfactory after developing and editing the footage, and it will be shown in the "China" October newsreel. It is a pity that our compatriots in Shanghai cannot see it for the time being!

### Recording the Three Leads of "Earthbound"

— Sha Wei

"Earthbound" is another film similar to "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" and "Merrily We Live." The three leading actors in the film can also be considered box-office stars in Hollywood. The first is Warner Baxter, who plays the "ghost" in "Earthbound." He has been in the film industry for more than ten years and used to be a popular star on par with big stars like John Barrymore. This film is his first film after making a comeback. With his resolute and decisive style and mature and steady acting skills, it should not be difficult for him to restore his past glory.

Andrea Leeds, since she married businessman Bobo last year, has also retired from the film industry to focus on her family. Recently, she has returned to Fox Studios. If she weren't on the screen, she would already be a highly respected female writer. When she was in school, she had a deep understanding of literature. Later, at a certain charity performance, she was fortunate enough to have her acting skills appreciated by a producer. After a screen test, she was cast as Edward Arnold's daughter in "Stage Door," laying a good foundation for her ascent to stardom.

Although Ko-Pah-Li's name is not as well-known as the previous two, her screen career started quite early, but the role she played in "The Adventures of Robin Hood" was not important and went unnoticed. As for how she got into the film industry, it was actually very accidental and quite interesting. Because Lin-Pah-Li hoped to become a star in the future, but was troubled by the lack of acquaintances to introduce her, she waited for opportunities at the entrance of the studio every day. One day, a large group of stars had just returned to the studio from outside. Lin-Pah-Li saw that the opportunity was rare and, with a flash of inspiration, mingled among them and sneaked in. At that time, they were preparing to shoot "The Adventures of Robin Hood." The director saw that this Miss Mo looked very good, but he didn't know why she was bumping around, so he asked about her intentions and let her make a cameo appearance in the play. Who knew that this cameo appearance would really create her current position.

Bester and Lin-Pah-Li in "Earthbound" are not the first collaboration. They have co-starred in "The Return of the Cisco Kid" before. This time, they added the beautiful Andrea Leeds, which shows that the eyes of box-office film merchants are quite confident.

### Celebrating the Naming Anniversary of Rue Yü Tsia-King

— Chou Cheng

The fifth anniversary of the naming of Rue Yü Tsia-King was celebrated on the 1st of this month at the Shipping Club, with a performance of Peking opera by famous amateur and professional actors. I went there in the rain at 5:30 in the evening, just as Chen Zelin and Lin Wanqing were performing the farewell scene of their determination to join the army. Mr. Chen sang and acted very energetically. Wu Shuzhou (as Lü Bu) and Li Kechang (as Ji Ling) were very well-suited for the scene of shooting the halberd at the gate of the camp. Zhao Peixin (as Pinggui) and Qiu Tianhong (as Baochuan) were both excellent in the scene of Pinggui returning to the kiln, and can be described as a perfect match. Mr. Zhao's appearance is similar to that of Ma Lianliang. Everyone said that after eighteen years, he not only didn't look old but actually looked fairer and more tender. Bi Linghong (Fengyang female), Liu Binkun (Fengyang male), and Han Jinkui (ugly young master) jointly performed the flower drum dance. Xiao Mao was beautiful and graceful, and Liu Han was also an experienced craftsman, humorous and witty, making people laugh. Liao Jiaai (as Su San) was the most popular when she appeared in the scene of Su San being escorted. The flower baskets were all over the stage, and the applause was continuous. Coupled with Han Jinkui's Chong Gongdao, they complemented each other. Yuan Ludeng was very afraid of her and said that others were sending flower baskets to support the show, so I had to pay my respects with both hands. Mr. Qiaqing watched with a smile and said that it was not easy for the quick-training class to achieve such results. Zhang Yizu's "Three Hall Trial" and Wang Zhunchen's "Power Over Nanyang," although the plots of the plays were different, they both sang and acted very energetically. Cheng Zhongfan (as Fourth Son) and Zhu Xiaoqiu (as Princess) performed "Sitting in the Palace." Mr. Cheng is the son of Governor Cheng Xuelou. His appearance was dignified, and Ms. Zhu was petite and exquisite, just like a woman. Yuan Ludeng saw that her fingers were dyed red and thought she was indeed a woman, and argued with others. After Mr. Qiaoqing confirmed it, they looked at each other and laughed. The finale was Huang Guiqiu and Sun Junqing's "Fenhe Bay." Famous actors and famous amateurs, all of them were equally skilled. Coupled with Huang Keqin's younger brother's Ding Shan, it added even more color. The performance ended at midnight.

### Da Hu Theater Scheduled to Open This Month

— Qing Xian

Mr. Wang, the owner of Jing'an Shopping Mall on Yu Yuan Road, seeing the development of the Shanghai film industry and the lack of suitable theaters in western Shanghai, demolished the foreign-style houses in the shopping mall and built a three-story building. The theater is located on the second and third floors, named Da Hu Theater. The downstairs is still used as a shopping mall business department. It was originally scheduled to open on October 10, but due to the slow progress of the water and wood works, the seats and paint have not been completed, so the opening date may be delayed. Regarding what films will be shown after the opening, according to the person in charge of the theater, foreign films and domestic films, first-run and second-run, will all be shown.

### Twenty Kinds of Yue Opera (3) Pan Fu Suo Fu

Zeng Rong and Yan Lanzhen, one is the "descendant of a loyal family" who is being falsely accused by a traitorous party and is still a fugitive wanted by the authorities, and the other is the daughter of a powerful traitor. After the marriage, the young master Zeng was full of worries and always looked unhappy! Miss Yan repeatedly "questioned" him before he dared to tell her the truth. After the truth was revealed, Miss Yan was very understanding and knew that "love is more important than everything," so of course she helped her husband and betrayed her father. This section is "Pan Fu" (Questioning the Husband).

Zeng Rong attended a banquet at Yan's mansion, and after drinking, he wandered in the garden and mistakenly entered the specimen building, where he fell in love with Zhao Wenhua's daughter, Zhao Wanzhen, and did not return all night. It was not until Yan Lanzhen went to search for him that she found Zeng Rong in the bowl cabinet. This section is "Suo Fu" (Demanding the Husband).

(4) Shilin Sacrifices to the Pagoda

The righteous demon Bai Suzhen was imprisoned in the Leifeng Pagoda by Fahai. When she entered the pagoda, her son (Shilin) was just a month old.

Eighteen years later, Xu Shilin returned home in glory after passing the imperial examination and sacrificed to the pagoda to find his mother. When the mother and son met, there was a tearful aria in Yue Opera.

"Scholar Bai Sacrifices to the Pagoda," this story is quite popular among women.

### Watching the "San Lian" Second Week Performance

— Zhi Xing

Hua Lian, Yin Lian, and Bao Lian's "San Lian" held a second week of experimental performance at the Xuantong Theater on the morning of the 20th. The programs included (1) The Red Lantern, (2) Romeo and Juliet, and (3) Little Girl. My impressions are as follows:

The Red Lantern - is a familiar and common script. The most important role in it is Shi Sanye. The role of Shi Sanye was played by Shi Li this time. The performance was quite successful, showing that he is a theatrical talent. The other roles were mediocre.

Romeo and Juliet - This is not Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet", but tells the story of two pairs of famous actors who play Romeo and Juliet. One pair used to enjoy great fame in the past, but now they have fallen into decline because of "old age." The other pair is in the limelight, but they often quarrel due to "professional jealousy," but in the end, they reconcile.

The most experienced actor was Mingxi, who played Romeo. His voice was calm and clear. Shen Ying, who played Juliet, was not bad, but her lines were too fast, making it difficult to understand. Others such as Pan Wan'er, Yan Yan, and Luo were all competent.

Little Girl - is the story of fighting wolves in Jiangnan. The dialogue is enough to excite people, such as "When the devils come, we will send them to the West!" The impassioned speeches aroused applause from the audience. Finally, when the little girl and her grandfather were looking at the distant large army, the little girl said excitedly: "It's ours, grandpa, the blue is like the sky above our heads, the white is like the sun's halo; the red is like our blood..." The whole audience applauded enthusiastically again.

The actors such as Wei Lu's little girl, Fang Bai's old man, and Lu Yu's little fool are all good, but unfortunately, Wei Lu's voice as the little girl is not pleasant to listen to. It is particularly sharp and a little hoarse. The other roles are fine.

As I left the theater, I was thinking: "San Lian has a bright future!"
