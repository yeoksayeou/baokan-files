### Anglo-American Agreement on Plans for Jointly Imposing Severe Blow on Japan; Rumor of Japanese Troops Assembling to Threaten Singapore; Sino-British Authorities to Negotiate Loan Details

Chongqing – According to reliable sources here, Mr. Song Ziwen will soon travel from the United States to London to negotiate the details of a new loan to China with British authorities. Meanwhile, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, is expected to remain in Chongqing during the negotiations. According to Reuters, the newly appointed British Embassy Military Attaché will arrive in Chongqing soon from London, but his name has not yet been announced. It is said that this person is quite familiar with Far Eastern affairs and has worked in the Far Eastern Division of the War Office. Chinese here attach great importance to the United States placing iron and steel manufactures under export license control, which is said to deal a severe blow to Japan. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo – Asahi Shimbun reported in today’s editorial that the British loan of one million pounds to the Chongqing government and the American announcement of expanded restrictions on steel exports to Japan occurred simultaneously, indicating that Britain and the United States have agreed on a plan to jointly pressure Japan. This is only part of a larger plan. Previously, Britain prioritized the European war and hesitated between compromise and conflict with Japan. Now, Britain has followed the leadership of the United States and is providing financial assistance to Chongqing. The expression of hostility by Britain and the United States towards Japan will only strengthen General Chiang Kai-shek's resistance, prolong the Sino-Japanese War, and exacerbate the hostility between Chongqing and Nanjing. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo – The "Asahi Shimbun" today believes that the recent implementation of the iron ore export license system by the United States and the British loan to Chongqing are "joint Anglo-American pressure on Japan." The newspaper stated that Britain and the United States should be aware that their actions are sufficient to hinder the restoration of peace in China, and that these actions are opposed by Japan. It also learned that the "Asahi Shimbun" has repeatedly launched major attacks on a "joint Anglo-American Far Eastern front" in recent days. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)

Washington – Japan purchases as many as 150 types of war materials from the United States every day, including ten basic chemical raw materials, thirteen basic metals and raw ores, sixteen industrial raw materials and alloys, thirty-two machine tools for manufacturing machinery, and gasoline, lubricating oil, etc. In terms of military equipment, Japan purchases eighteen types of bombs, twenty-one types of poison gas, twenty-nine types of fire extinguishers, and firearms, etc. Japan is also buying blueprints for manufacturing aircraft engines and tanks. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)

Washington – Reports from Vietnam indicate that Japan is assembling troops on the islands between Vietnam and Borneo, with the aim of blockading Singapore. People here are quite skeptical of this, believing that Japan is unlikely to take any action in the short term that would lead to open armed conflict with Britain, as the Axis powers are currently losing ground and there is no non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union for protection. In addition, the British grant of a new loan to China, the new American restrictions on the export of goods to Japan, and the concentration of the US Navy in Hawaii can all curb Japan's adventurous ambitions. According to many observers here, the British loan to China acknowledges that the European and Asian wars are fundamentally one and the same, and will, for all practical purposes, make China an ally of Britain to resist the Nazi goal of controlling the world. The New York Times published an article stating that the wars in Europe and Asia have merged into one, and China's ability to resist is becoming increasingly important. It also stated that a recent book by Soviet Commissioner Motilyov is highly noteworthy. It states that Japan's currency inflation, economic exhaustion, and lack of raw materials are gradually becoming critical, and that this phenomenon has led to a high degree of social tension. The book predicts that the Sino-Japanese War has reached its third stage. Japan initially had the upper hand, then entered a period of stagnation, and now the main force has shifted to the Chinese side. The book is intended for sale in the Soviet Union and does not indicate any Soviet intention to Sovietize China, which the author of the New York Times article considers extremely important. The book also contains no words of comfort to Japan. If it were intended to prepare Soviet readers to sacrifice China's interests in order to deal with Japan in the future, such words would inevitably have been included. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)

### United States Taking Appropriate Steps; Far Eastern Policy Developing Strongly

Washington – The New York Times' statement yesterday that the European and Asian wars are ultimately one war can be confirmed by the recent activities of the British and American governments. Both the United States and Britain have successively provided loans to China, and the United States has imposed restrictions on the export of metallic materials. All of these actions cannot be regarded as assistance to China and other countries resisting Nazi aggression, but as a blow to Japan. American finances are now concentrated in Hawaii. Although this is said to have no diplomatic significance, Japan will definitely pay considerable attention to it. The new restrictions on metal exports are clearly aimed at Japan, because the previous ban on metal exports to Japan was still loose and exploitable, but now it is effectively restricted to block the loopholes. People here are well aware that the United States will take other appropriate steps as needed based on the situation. According to reports from the Far East, American expatriates in the Far East seem surprised by the recent firm advice to American expatriates to withdraw from the East. They may not be able to foresee the strong development of American Eastern policy, although not rapid, and deeply understand the transformation of the national sentiment in their home country; otherwise, they would not be so surprised. According to Washington politicians, the mood in Congress is gradually changing, and the call of "We must not participate in the war" is rarely heard now. The American people still have a desire not to easily participate in the war, but as the new form of Nazi policy in Europe and Asia has become increasingly clear, Congress has the feeling that the United States must take some steps for its own safety. In short, as the New Year approaches and Congress is about to convene, the current image of the United States is to say less empty words and do more practical things. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)

### Quezon and Sayre's Quarrel; US Officials Considering

Washington – Reliable sources said yesterday that administrative officials involved in Philippine affairs are preparing to send a memorandum to the US President regarding the recent quarrel between President Quezon and US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre. It is said that the conclusion of the memorandum is not entirely in favor of Sayre, because Quezon recently attacked Sayre for telling the press that President Roosevelt had rejected the amendment to the Philippine Constitution. Officials from the Bureau of Insular Affairs have discussed the statements of Sayre and Quezon. Some reliable sources also believe that the United States may appoint another commissioner to replace Sayre, but the government has not actually discussed this yet. It is also heard that Secretary of the Interior Ickes has personally expressed dissatisfaction with the general situation in the Philippines, and that most insular affairs officials are biased towards Sayre. However, insular affairs officials ultimately advocate finding a way to deal with this situation. The people generally consider Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the Asiatic Fleet, and Democratic Senator King to be possible successors to Sayre as High Commissioner to the Philippines.

There has been widespread speculation here that there will be changes in the cabinet, but this rumor has been dispelled by the fact that the military is supporting the government to control industry. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)

Japanese Ministry of Finance to Revise Paper Money Issuance System

Tokyo – It was learned today that the Ministry of Finance will submit a law to revise the Bank of Japan's paper money issuance system to the next Diet session. The main purpose is to formulate a legal system for the Ministry of Finance to stipulate the maximum amount that can be issued on a yearly basis, according to the French method from 1870 to 1918. The Bank of Japan's current reserves are divided into two categories: gold and silver, and securities. The revised system will establish total reserves and include gold and silver coins, gold and silver bars, government securities, and commercial bills. The exchange system will be retained, as the Bank of Japan issues a huge amount of paper money every day, so this revision is necessary. The Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan's bureau have agreed on preliminary measures. As far as can be ascertained, it is not yet decided whether the paper money issuance system of the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Taiwan will also be revised, or whether the Bank of Japan's paper money will replace the paper money of these banks.

Washington – British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian passed away this morning at the British Embassy here. As of now, no further news has been released regarding this matter. Lord Lothian had been ill for several days and was unable to attend a joint conference of the US Department of Agriculture last night to give a speech, which was delivered by the Embassy Counselor in his stead. Lord Lothian was 48 years old and was appointed as the British Ambassador to the United States last April, succeeding Sir Ronald Lindsay. He suddenly went to London last month to discuss a certain matter with the British government. After returning to Washington, he told reporters that Britain would soon need financial assistance to carry out the war. Before entering the diplomatic world, Lord Lothian was a journalist. In 1916, he was appointed as the Prime Minister's Secretary and then transferred to the India Office to attend the parliamentary session. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

The heroic Greeks have dealt a fatal blow to Mussolini's dignity." His speech was read by British Embassy Counselor Butterworth. The speech stated that the British air battle in mid-September had completely shattered the German plan to invade Britain, and that Germany's victory in Norway and France had become dim.

Editorial

### Recent Actions of Britain and the United States and China

Yesterday, the New York Times commented on the latest international trends, believing that the two sets of wars in Europe and Asia are ultimately one war; it cited the recent activities of Britain and the United States, as well as the fact that both the European and Asian wars were driven by aggression and counter-aggression, as evidence. This judgment has its basis and can be seen as beneficial to China's international position in the war of resistance; but at least so far, we can hardly agree to this judgment unconditionally: first, there is fundamentally no hostility between China and Germany; although Germany has repeatedly given China infuriating stimuli, such as the Tripartite Pact, which China cannot ignore, the expressions made by Germany after the fact are enough to offset most of the unpleasant feelings that China has towards Germany. Second, the Asian war has always had room to be isolated from the flames of Europe, and so far there is even a reason for all parties to cooperate in first suppressing the aggression in Asia and seeking stability in Asia first; not only is there a reason, but there is also the possibility, as long as all parties cooperate effectively; and the achievements of Greece give this aspect better time and space. If the subsequent evolution of facts is still as sparse and circuitous as in the past few years, then what the New York Times said will ultimately be correct.

Examining the trends, it is true that the past and present have changed. For example, using the same arguments adopted by the New York Times, our conclusion is not that the two wars have merged. Instead, it is (1) the international division in Asia is more obvious, (2) the speed of exerting pressure on Japan has accelerated, the density has increased, and the intensity has strengthened, and (3) the number of wins and losses has completed a clear outline. For example, US President Roosevelt personally announced a confirmed loan of US$50 million to China and another US$50 million with undetermined methods. Within ten days, not only did the United States immediately follow up with the fleet's gathering in Hawaii and new restrictions on gold exports, but Britain also announced a loan of £10 million to China before the details had been determined. Such a force of tremendous force, like a sudden thunder and rain, followed one after another. Considering the parallel cooperation of Britain and the United States, the strong support for China, and the display of an unrelenting and uncompromising attitude towards aggression, its speed, density, and strength can at least be described as unprecedented in the past decade. What is even more special is that it is indeed unprecedented that the British and American loans were announced as established as soon as possible without waiting for all the methods to be detailed; this atmosphere is by no means a small detail that should be regarded as a branch in international exchanges; it is a sign that Britain and the United States are in high spirits and acting urgently towards China and Asia. Just compare this with the sparseness and circuitousness that everyone has felt in the past few years, and you can understand the meaning of this determination and urgency. Therefore, we do not have to confuse the two wars in Europe and Asia into one view. Only within the scope of the Asian war, the fact that Britain and the United States stand on China's side without any consideration of any reaction, the main point is not to say that the firmness of US national policy has been proven again, nor is it necessary to say that Britain no longer hesitates on the fork in the road of conflict and compromise with Japan, but it shows that there is absolutely no room for shaking and changing the battle line in the Asian war, that is, it eliminates the Japanese side's long-standing delusion that there is still room for it to play with internationally. Comparing this trend with the Japanese side's diplomatic offensives such as the Tripartite Pact four months ago and the Matsuoka talks the other day, as well as its political and military offensives in China, it can be seen that Japan's complete failure is indeed only remaining with two questions: one is when will Japan choose to admit its failure in words and actions? One is whether Japan will bet its desperate stake between the Pacific and Indian Oceans before admitting failure? In addition, there is no more room for experimentation, and there is no more room for doubt. And as the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun commented yesterday: "It is clear that Britain and the United States have agreed on a plan to jointly exert pressure on Japan, and this is only part of their plan," it can be seen that the Japanese are also aware of what they will encounter in the future.

Here is what the Chinese government and people should realize: in the last moment before Japan confirms its failure, it is very likely that it will carry out its final devastation and destruction of China from the military side, such as the so-called autumn offensive in the southwest of Taihu Lake and the so-called winter offensive on both sides of the Xiang River. Although the Japanese side was successively defeated due to China's counterattacks, the Chinese military and people still need to continue to prepare for more painful sacrifices than in the past forty months to resist the attacks aimed at devastation and destruction in various war zones, and to accelerate its overall collapse. The recent British and American loans to China are all related to Chinese finance, which is effective and valuable assistance; with such assistance, the exchange rate remains stable, which is an excellent way for China and Britain and the United States to prevent the outflow of Chinese capital; however, in a situation where the overall situation has the possibility of a sharp turn downwards, businessmen should be most careful to prevent the economic impact of this shock; it is only by breaking the superstition of the value of goods and strengthening the confidence in the value of legal tender that the degree of change can be reduced and unnecessary losses in the change can be avoided.

### Thai Anti-American Sentiment Rapidly Increasing; US Goods See Significant Sales Decline in Thailand; Large Quantities of Japanese Goods Arrive in Thailand for Dumping

Bangkok - Anti-American sentiment here is rapidly increasing because the U.S. State Department has expressed its stance against Thailand's claims to former territories from Vietnam. Thai circles today believe that among the three Far Eastern powers (Britain, the United States, and Japan), two have already recognized the legitimacy of Thailand's demands. Only the U.S. resolutely opposes any action that could "drag the country into war." The U.S. seems to believe that if Thailand were to engage in war, it could escalate into a major conflagration, potentially drawing in the Far East, because the U.S. might be forced to fight in the Pacific Ocean to uphold the "status quo." How Britain, the U.S., and Japan will position themselves is of utmost importance should a large-scale war break out between Thailand and Vietnam. According to Thai observations, if none of these three countries steps forward to support them, French resistance will undoubtedly be extinguished. As of now, only the U.S. has expressed its official opinion on the Thai-Vietnamese conflict. Besides reiterating its "status quo" policy, the State Department has repeatedly hinted at the government's views, such as the recent detention of ten U.S.-made bombers destined for Thailand in Manila. This attitude of the U.S. is causing great anxiety in Thailand, as Thailand has relied on the U.S. for the majority of its military supplies since the outbreak of the European war. American merchants in Bangkok are also uneasy about the U.S.'s attitude towards Thailand. The recent significant decline in sales of American goods in Thailand represents the Thai people's anti-American sentiment. Some fear that this attitude of the U.S. may force Thailand to embrace Japan. Japanese merchants have already seized this opportunity to ship large quantities of Japanese goods to Thailand for dumping. Although Japan has not yet formally expressed its official opinion, the Thai people generally believe that Japan sympathizes with Thailand. (Reuter/United Press, 12th)

Japanese Side Demands Vietnamese Governor Suppress Pro-British Elements

Hanoi - Members of the Japanese delegation here and other Japanese officials believe that the current situation in southern Vietnam is "quite similar to Norway before it was occupied by German forces." These Japanese insist on their view that the British in Singapore are planning to attack Saigon, so the activities of the local Tegor Party members should be stopped immediately. They also claim that there are many pro-Chiang Kai-shek elements in Saigon who should be eliminated. Since November 1, the Japanese have repeatedly demanded the occupation of Saigon and control of Saigon's customs, but each time, the demand has been withdrawn due to the need for further consideration. Replacing this demand is the Japanese demand to Vietnamese Governor General Decoux, asking him to suppress the pro-British and pro-Chiang elements in the south. (United Press, 12th)

Vietnam Still Willing to Negotiate Settlement of Demands on Thailand

Tokyo - According to news from Hanoi, the Vietnamese authorities in charge stated solemnly yesterday that their attitude towards Thailand remains unchanged. Vietnam is still willing to resolve border disputes with Thailand at any time through negotiation, but Vietnam is also determined to respond to enemy measures with hostile actions. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Shanghai French Official Denies Suspension of Vietnamese-Japanese Talks

Local News - Several newspapers in this city today carried reports saying that Japanese troops are preparing to land in Saigon. Informed French sources here were greatly surprised upon hearing this news, as all the information received by the French authorities in Shanghai is completely contradictory to such rumors. In addition, there are reports that the economic talks planned between France and Japan will be abandoned and the delegation sent by the French government will cancel its trip to Japan. Informed French sources here also denied this claim, saying that the French delegation referred to is led by former Vietnamese Governor General Robin, who departed from France on the 4th of this month to come east. Once he arrives in Japan, he will, according to the original plan, meet with the delegation sent by the Governor General's office of Vietnam (currently passing through Shanghai) to conduct negotiations with the Japanese side without any changes. (Havas, 12th)

Thai Aircraft and Artillery Continue to Attack Vietnam

Hanoi - An official communiqué recently announced that "several Thai aircraft flew over Bangkate City, Laos, Vietnam, at 8:30 a.m. yesterday, dropping over a dozen bombs, causing minor damage to local houses, but fortunately no casualties. This morning at 9:30 a.m., six more Thai aircraft flew to the Pakese airfield, dropping three bombs, causing neither casualties nor any losses. In addition, five Thai aircraft flew over Viet Tri City, dropping two bombs, all landing in rice paddies, and strafing the ground with machine guns, also without casualties." (Havas, 11th)

Bangkok - The Thai Supreme Command recently announced that yesterday, Thai forces used artillery, rifles, and machine guns to fiercely fire at Taek on the Vietnamese southern border across the Mekong River. At the same time, the Thai air force bombed the airfields of Taek, Viet Tri, and Savannakhet. On Tuesday morning, when French artillery shelled Mek Dara (transliteration) in Savannakhet, one Thai aircraft was shot down, killing eleven French soldiers. (United Press, 12th)

Singapore - The Thai Consulate here issued a communiqué today stating that the Thai Air Force, in retaliation for French bombing of Thai territory, has raided Bonteat and Banapope across the Vietnamese border. As long as the French bombing does not stop, Thailand's retaliation will continue. If the French authorities send a delegation to Bangkok based on the agreement reached in October, the Thai government still intends to negotiate border demarcation based on international practices. (Reuters, 12th)

Vietnamese and French Authorities Announce Border Conflict Incidents

Yu Bian - French authorities recently told reporters that a series of incidents, including aerial bombings and border skirmishes, mostly occurred in Poipet (transliteration), located in the center of the Thai-Vietnamese railway and highway. Although Thailand's initial major offensive against Vietnam may have been to attack the area near Poipet leading to Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, Cambodia is currently very quiet because the province has been fully prepared and has clearly demonstrated its strength. Aircraft fly over the area every day without attacking. As for the border, Thai and Vietnamese troops exchange machine-gun fire almost daily. French authorities claim that French forces have now established a line of defense several miles from the border. This area, according to the Franco-Thai agreement, should be a demilitarized zone, but since Thai aircraft have appeared over this area, the so-called Franco-Thai agreement is also equivalent to waste paper. Authorities also said that the border conflict was actually caused by Thais frequently firing machine guns at various towns and looting, and that the activities of the Fifth Column in Cambodia have failed. These activities were carried out by communists and some high-ranking Buddhists who had studied in Bangkok. The party members have been detained. (United Press, 12th)

Vichy - The French Colonial Ministry issued a communiqué last night describing the French air force's retaliatory bombings of Vietnam, stating that two Thai aircraft formations bombed Savannakhet, dropping thirteen bombs, causing considerable damage but no casualties. The French air force retaliated by bombing the Gotan airfield in Min Tiemipei, dropping one and a half tons of bombs. During an air battle over Savannakhet, one Thai aircraft was shot down, and another was damaged. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Hanoi - The Vietnamese government formally announced that French aircraft dropped three tons of bombs in Udom (transliteration) and Sakon Nakhon (transliteration), west of Taek, last night, in retaliation for Thai aircraft attacks on Vietnam. The mission of the French aircraft can be said to have been accomplished. It was also stated that it is now possible to speak with the French Minister to Thailand, Garut, as there had been no communication with Garut for two weeks. Officials also strongly stated that the communist turmoil in Cochinchina has been suppressed, and the situation there is completely under government control. Governor Decoux of Vietnam will inspect the south in the coming days. (United Press, 12th)

Vietnamese Governor Decoux Increases Bodyguard

Hanoi - Vietnamese Governor-General Lieutenant General Decoux has increased his personal bodyguard because there are rumors that a naval officer intends to assassinate Decoux. Although the news of the plot to harm Decoux's life has not been confirmed, four Japanese men rode horses into the governor's mansion grounds and galloped back and forth in front of the mansion. (United Press, 12th)

### Major Victory for British Forces in North Africa; Capture of Sidi Barrani; Two Italian Divisions Surrounded; Three Senior Generals Captured

Cairo - British forces in North Africa, taking advantage of their victory yesterday, advanced and occupied Sidi Barrani, the forward base of the Italian forces, achieving a sensational victory. The Italian forces were routed, retreating to Libya. In less than three days since the British offensive began, a decisive victory has been achieved. As British mechanized units advanced rapidly and occupied this important seaport, they seized large quantities of military supplies and captured many prisoners, including three senior Italian generals. According to unofficial estimates here last night, between 10,000 and 20,000 Italian soldiers were captured, including officers of all ranks. After being occupied by Italian forces advancing from Libya, Sidi Barrani became the base for the Italian offensive against British forces. According to Italian predictions, an Italian offensive from this location could drive the British out of Africa. (International Telegram, 12th)

London - British forces, launching a lightning-fast operation in the western Egyptian desert, have captured Sidi Barrani, a key forward base for the Italian forces in the western desert, dealing a fatal blow to the Italian attempt to conquer Egypt. According to a communiqué issued in Cairo, after Sidi Barrani fell into British hands, the war continued satisfactorily. The important point of this battle is that the British captured a large number of enemy troops and war materials. Another communiqué stated that three Italian generals were captured. The British victory around Sidi Barrani was due to the implementation of a carefully planned strategy. British armored forces first attacked the enemy's right flank, then broke through behind the enemy, while British forces launched a fierce frontal attack on the enemy positions fifteen miles east of Sidi Barrani at Maqtila, achieving a great victory. Several Italian divisions were attacked from all sides, and seeing their retreat cut off, they fell into chaos.

It is reported from London that General Wavell, commander of the British forces in the Middle East, will soon officially announce the details in Cairo. The British forces led by Wavell have now broken into the middle of the Italian forces in the Sidi Barrani area and the Italian forces supporting them from afar in the west. Compared with the Albanian campaign, the front line in Egypt is extremely long, extending over 3,500 miles from Libya to Italian East Africa, longer than the border between Canada and the United States. For mechanized troops, this is the best time to fight in Egypt, as the desert is more solid at this time than at any other time. (Reuters, 12th)

London - British military authorities here recently stated that because two Italian divisions are trapped in Sidi Barrani, the British forces in the western desert have a good opportunity to capture approximately 28,000 to 34,000 more Italian soldiers. When the British forces attacked Sidi Barrani, they also captured three Italian generals, one being General Gariboldi, one being General Bergonzoli, and one being General Mersa-Matrouh. British authorities also stated that we have now captured an Italian general, and if our hopes are realized, the large amount of Italian supplies in the Sidi Barrani area will become a gift to us. (United Press, 12th)

London - The British forces in the western desert are now continuing to put pressure on the Italian forces. British naval and air forces continue to obstruct the retreating Italian troops from time to time. There is fierce fighting in the Buq Buq area west of Barrani. The area was occupied by British forces yesterday, fifteen miles west of Sidi Barrani. According to sources here, most of the Italian forces in Sidi Barrani and its vicinity have had their retreat cut off. It is likely that two divisions (between 14,000 and 17,000 men) will be captured by British forces. (Reuters, 12th)

Cairo - A naval communiqué issued here last night stated that the British navy bombarded the Italian forces retreating along the coast on the nights of December 10 and 11, and shelled the Italian forces on the roads around Sollum. (Reuters, 12th)

British Air Force Conducts Extensive Operations

Cairo - The British Air Force in the Middle East launched an extremely fierce attack yesterday, bombing airfields, troops, and motor transport vehicles in the desert area of Italian Libya all day long, inflicting great damage. According to a British Air Force communiqué, British aircraft carried out such extensive activities for 24 hours, and only one aircraft did not return. Six Italian aircraft were confirmed shot down, and another three Italian aircraft lost control. British aircraft attacked the El Adem airfield very fiercely last night, destroying several more enemy aircraft, and high-explosive bombs set fire to several aircraft hangars. The flames soared high, and could still be seen 60 miles away. British aircraft also dropped many bombs on motor transport convoys and enemy barracks concentrated in the Bardia and Sollum areas, bombing fiercely. The British Naval Air Arm also cooperated with the British Air Force, attacking the Bardia barracks and the roads on the Sollum slopes. In addition, British aircraft bombed a landing field, and another enemy aircraft was destroyed on the ground in Gazala. The total number of enemy aircraft destroyed yesterday reached ten, and the number of damaged aircraft is unknown. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

British and Egyptians Greatly Excited

London - An important official of the Egyptian government told a Reuters interviewer that the capture of Sidi Barrani by British forces was greatly praised, saying that the news would excite the entire territory of Egypt. The Italian defeat has dispelled all doubts about the security of Egypt. All public entertainment venues in Cairo have announced this victory. The Egyptians were extremely enthusiastic upon hearing the news, cheering for Britain. All newspapers published this news in a special position on the front page. The "Al-Ahram" newspaper used the phrase "What is ours has been returned to us" from the Quran as the headline for the news. Military figures in London were also very pleased to receive the news, but pointed out in cautious tones that there is no question of a complete Italian collapse. It is said that more Italian troops will undoubtedly be captured, but the battlefield is still "fluid." Some surrounded enemy troops have the possibility of breaking out, as the British forward units are widely dispersed. Although three Italian generals were captured, it does not necessarily mean that all three divisions of the enemy were captured, as the three generals may all belong to the same division. (Reuters, 12th)

Blackshirts Depart to Front Lines as Reinforcements

Rome - It is reported from here that 50,000 British troops are attacking Sidi Barrani, and the Italian forces are doing their best to defend it. The battle is extremely fierce. A thousand Italian Blackshirt troops have departed from Libya by truck to reinforce it. The British forces are composed of Australian and New Zealand soldiers and elite British Scottish troops. Over a thousand British mechanized troops are coming in force, most of which are trucks equipped with huge steamships that travel at 40 miles per hour, each carrying 6,000 soldiers and several machine guns. General Graziani, Governor of Libya and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in Africa, has been defending the area strongly for several months because Sidi Barrani controls the main highway and transportation lines and its position is extremely important. (United Press, 12th)

British Air Force General Arrives in Cairo

Cairo - The British attack on the Italian forces in North Africa is becoming increasingly tense. British Air Chief Marshal William Tait has personally arrived in Cairo to command the Near East Air Force. Tait is replacing Air Chief Marshal Owen Boyd, who went missing at the end of November. Boyd was forced to land on Sicily while flying to Cairo, and was captured by the Italians along with the six people on the plane. (United Press, 12th)

Ankara - British Air Chief Marshal Tait arrived in Cairo yesterday and will assume the new position of Deputy Commander of the British Air Force in the Near East. Dade was originally the British Air Force Commander in Singapore. (Haitong Dispatch, 12th)

### Fate of Italy Depends on War on Both Sides of the Mediterranean

New York - Britain is now doing its best to replay the Battle of Dunkirk, but this battle situation is completely different from the last one. The British Air Force is taking the offensive, while the enemy is fleeing in panic. The purpose of the British forces fighting Mussolini's troops simultaneously in Albania and Egypt is to achieve this. If victory is achieved in one place, or both places are successful, the world may witness a military collapse unprecedented in history. Churchill's speech describing the safe evacuation of 300,000 besieged British troops from Dunkirk is still fresh in our memory, how the dark-faced, tired, and disappointed British troops boarded battleships, transport ships, speedboats, sampans, or even flat-bottomed boats, and crossed the English Channel under the wings of Nazi bombers unscathed. But Mussolini can no longer hope for a repeat of the miracle of Dunkirk, because the situation in the Mediterranean and the English Channel is very different from what it was in the past. The British troops stationed in Dunkirk often used the help of dense fog in the English Channel to block the vision of German bombers, and the British army often received the help of naval soldiers of all ranks, but Mussolini does not have this kind of maritime advantage. The most unfavorable thing for the Italian forces is that the Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea are often bathed in brilliant sunshine. If the Italian forces, when necessary, abandon their bases in Africa and return home by sea, the British Air Force stationed in Malta and various government islands can strike the Italian forces from beginning to end. It is reported that Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano set off for Berlin yesterday to consult with the German side, but Ciano may get nothing, because the Germans are usually very cautious and are unwilling to throw themselves into the trap set by the Italian Prime Minister for himself. (International Telegram, 12th)

London - A Reuters military commentator said that the British capture of Sidi Barrani in Africa shows that the British have won a great victory. If they can continue to make persistent efforts, the morale of the Italian army and the domestic political situation in Italy will have a huge reaction. Judging from the brief news we have now, the British forces seem to be moving forward with great effort and determination, in order to take advantage of the existing British advantages and obtain greater benefits. The Libyan problem is not another problem, but is connected to the Greek war and should be regarded as one thing. The British forces must not give the Italian forces a chance to breathe at any point, and maintain maximum pressure in order to win a decisive victory. (Reuters, 12th)

Athens - Greek newspapers commented on the victory of the British forces in Africa, saying that the fascist regime is now collapsing. The last hope of the fascists lies in the troops under Graziani. Now this army has been defeated. The British army is brave and can continue to make persistent efforts, and give the Italian forces in Africa a really good lesson. (Reuters, 12th)

### British Military Commentator Discusses the War Situation

London, Reuters - A military commentator stated, based on recent news from Cairo, that the opportunity to inflict another blow on the Italians in Libya had not been missed. General Graziani of the Italian forces rashly advanced his troops to Sidi Barrani and has now suffered a major defeat. Some Italian generals have been captured or killed, and over four thousand Italian soldiers have been captured. The British forces have also seized many tanks. This initial success of the British counter-offensive is truly exhilarating. However, it is still too early to speculate on the final outcome of these battles. The Italian army may be forced to retreat along the line and suffer a major defeat, or its main force around Sidi Barrani may break through and escape. However, there is also the possibility that the Italian army will suffer an even greater defeat. The battle situation on the road between Sollum and Sidi Barrani along the slope of the Libyan plateau may change. The British army will launch an encirclement operation to completely destroy the Italian army, and this is not limited to one place. Since the British have control of the sea, the British Navy may protect the landing of troops. Officials in Tobruk acknowledge that the large scale of this operation requires special efforts and involves significant risks, but the current timing is quite favorable because the enemy's morale has undoubtedly been greatly shaken, making it not difficult to defeat them in one fell swoop. A similar situation was seen during the collapse of the French army, where small German units disregarded the French army and actually penetrated deep into France and occupied Bordeaux. Now is the time for Britain to inflict a major blow on Italy. The active operations of the British Navy and Air Force have already made the enemy feel their power. It is gratifying that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, and Sir Wilson, commander of the Nile Division, are now using all their weapons to jointly defeat the enemy. It remains to be seen whether the British army can force the Italian army to retreat completely back to Libya. Arabs may rise up and attack isolated Italian units, and even make trouble for Italian settlers. The prospects for the Albanian war on the other side of the Mediterranean are also quite bright. Currently, Greek forces are pursuing the Italian army. Although the severe winter weather will inevitably slow down the progress of the Greek army, the retreating Italian army is also similarly affected by the weather. However, judging from past examples, in 1812, Napoleon's French army retreated from Moscow in severe cold, while the Russian army advanced through the frozen land. Which side benefited more from this advance and retreat? Today, the Italian army in Albania is in an extremely dangerous position. If the British can allocate a sufficient number of ships from the British Navy operating off the Libyan coast to Vlora, Albania, they can inflict a decisive blow on the Italian army. A naval attack on the port can cut off the retreat of half of the Italian army and prevent the reinforcement of Italian troops. It may even force the Italian fleet to engage in battle and give the British fleet the opportunity to annihilate the Italian navy. Mussolini and his fascist empire are now shaking and unstable. Can the British army carry out its initial intentions at this time and achieve complete success? This is indeed possible. (Reuters, 11th)

### Franco-Spanish Relations Improve

Paris - Yesterday, French newspapers commented on the presentation of credentials by the new French Ambassador to Spain, Patrice, stating that Franco-Spanish relations are about to improve. France has had no representative in Spain for six months.

### Italian Counterattack Ineffective, Greek Army Advances into Albanian Heartland, Oil Fields in the Devoll Valley Threatened, Italian Right Wing Retreats to the Heights of Këlcyrë

Athens - The Greek High Command stated this morning that the Greek army continued to advance last night in the three main war zones on the Albanian front, overcoming the "fierce" resistance of the Italian army. The Italian army launched repeated counterattacks under artillery cover, but they were all driven back. The Greek army is still taking the offensive, heading towards Vlora, Tepelena, and Elbasan, the gateway to the important Italian base of Argyrokastron. The Italian army along the Adriatic coast has retreated to the heights of Këlcyrë due to the Greek advance from Sarandë, which predicts the imminent fall of Palermë. It is also reported that two Greek columns are advancing north and west of Argyrokastron and Përmet, with their vanguard only five miles from Tepelena. The Greek army can now bombard this Italian base with artillery. A Greek official spokesman said today, "The Greek army has seized strategically valuable heights between Përmet and Tepelena. All enemy resistance has failed." It is reported that hundreds of Italian soldiers froze to death west of Pogradec. It is also heard that Greek shock troops have occupied a 5,000-foot mountain range, "The terrain of this mountain range is treacherous and the Italian army has launched several counterattacks in an attempt to regain it, but failed. (International News Agency, 12th)

London - The Greek army in Albania, advancing towards the Shkumbin River, has threatened the important oil resources of the Italians in the Devoll River valley. This is of great importance to Italy, as at least half of Italy's normal kerosene needs are obtained from the Devoll River valley. The Italians spent heavily in 1925 to develop this area. In 1932, the Italian government allocated 200 million lire to develop Albanian oil resources, which made considerable progress, and built a 46-mile-long pipeline to the oil port near Vlora. This pipeline began transporting oil in January 1936, and Mussolini was clearly pleased with this. In 1938, after the Italians occupied Albania, they gained absolute control over this oil field. (Reuters, 12th)

Belgrade - According to front-line news received here last night, the Italian army's resistance in the northern wing of the Greek-Italian war became increasingly strong yesterday, and it was able to stop the Greek army's advance.

West of Pogradec, the Greek army launched a fierce attack on the Italian positions, and both sides suffered heavy losses. As of last night, the battle was still continuing. The Italian army finally forced the Greek army to retreat to its original positions. The Italian army captured Udunisht, which had been occupied by the Greek army two days ago, north of Pogradec. The highway between Korçë and Pogradec was completely destroyed by Italian artillery and aircraft, making it very difficult for the Greek army to supply. Northwest of Argyrokastron, the Greek army has continued to occupy several new positions, and the Italian army has retreated to the new positions of Këlcyrë. It is expected that a fierce battle will take place in the near future. North of Delvinë, the Italian army is putting up strong resistance to stop the rapid advance of the Greek army.

Mexico - The new President of Mexico, Camacho, issued a decree abolishing the collective farming system implemented by former President Cárdenas.

The Painful History of the European War (5)

### The Truth About England and France's Hasty Entry into the War

Bonnet said, "At the end of August 1939, a few days before the war, I invited the commanders of the army and air force to my residence for a talk. I told them...the war is getting closer and closer. If Poland doesn't yield, the war will be inevitable in a short time. As military authorities, if you say we don't have much confidence in winning, I will advise Poland to cede Danzig and the corridor to Germany. I also know that this method is too dangerous, and the public will scold me for selling out Czechoslovakia and now Poland. But that doesn't matter, my only concern is that the country doesn't perish. Moreover, if France falls, can Poland remain safe? Don't misunderstand, thinking that I doubt the determination to fight Germany. Germany has been preparing for war with all its might for seven years. It cannot dominate Europe with mere intimidation; sooner or later, there will be a war. But delaying the outbreak of the European war may be beneficial to us. If we can gain another year or half a year to reorganize and strengthen the army, it may also be beneficial to us. That's why I'm asking for the opinions of you generals. I also want to ask: Are there any major reasons in the military that require Poland to endure the pain of sacrifice? Although they answered individually, they all said in unison: We don't see any military reason why the war must be delayed. Although delaying the time is beneficial to us, it is also equally beneficial to Germany. Once they said that, I had nothing to say."

Nevertheless, he made one last effort. At one o'clock in the afternoon on August 31, the French ambassador to Italy, Ponsot, telephoned Bonnet and said: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano intends to convene a conference to resolve the Polish issue and other outstanding issues. Bonnet believed that Ciano's move was sincere. Italy was not prepared for war. Although it had signed an alliance with Germany, it still had three years to hesitate before joining the war. Moreover, Italian public opinion unanimously hated war. It is said that Ciano's final meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was not harmonious. Italy only needed to say one word at the conference, and most of the long-awaited benefits could be easily obtained without resorting to war. Such a conference would benefit both England and France, and why not Italy? Bonnet decided to do his best to support this plan. He later told me that he went directly to Daladier to tell him about this and said, "The cabinet meeting will be held at six o'clock tonight, and I will strongly urge the cabinet members to accept it, and I hope you, Prime Minister, will assist from the side. In this way, we can present a fait accompli to Germany."

Daladier also agreed. But Bonnet misjudged the Prime Minister's temperament. That evening at the cabinet meeting, Daladier not only did not support him but also attacked him. Although the Italian proposal was not flatly rejected, the cabinet was only willing to wait and see and wait for direct negotiations between Germany and Poland. Therefore, the cabinet communique that night only had a few words, saying that "the cabinet unanimously supports the obligations accepted by France." At dawn on September 1, the German army marched into Poland in a mighty manner.

At 2:15 p.m. on the second afternoon, Bonnet heard the telephone ringing in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he couldn't help but be surprised when he picked up the receiver. There was not a word of greeting in the phone call, and he hurriedly said: "This is Ciano. Mr. Ponsot (French ambassador to Italy) and Sir Loraine (British ambassador to Italy) are here. I believe there is still a great possibility of convening a conference..."

Bonnet then allowed Ciano that France would never present an ultimatum to Germany before noon on Sunday. I believe that this incredible experience has not been revealed until now. France did abide by Bonnet's permission and waited until noon on Sunday to send the ultimatum to Germany, and it was not until 5:00 p.m. that it declared war on Germany. However, this fact is known to everyone. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany at 11:00 a.m. on September 3. There is a six-hour difference, and the inside story is as follows:

In 1939, British public opinion had reversed its attitude during the Munich Conference, and everyone was heartbroken about yielding again. Members of Parliament talked to their constituents during the holidays and saw that the people across the country had a very firm determination, and they were greatly moved. The British people believed that the war was inevitable, and the sooner the better. The members of Parliament were so moved by this public opinion that they decided not to let Chamberlain repeat the mistakes of last summer and bow down to Hitler again. Therefore, at 9:00 a.m. on September 3, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax telephoned Bonnet and said:

"Your country cannot issue an ultimatum before noon. I know you have your own difficulties, but our country has not made any promises to Ciano and must send out the ultimatum this morning. The British House of Commons will meet at noon. If the Prime Minister has not fulfilled his commitment to Poland when he attends, the House will be in an uproar, and he may have to step down..."

Although England and France are allies, the time of declaration of war differed by six hours, and the twists and turns are like this. On September 3, 1939, the great war finally broke out. For this war, England and France were completely unprepared, but Germany had been planning for it for a long time and used clever means to make England and France declare war first so as not to bear the responsibility of starting the war.

Looking back on the past, we can say that at least France had already failed at the beginning of the war.

France's defeat was due to insufficient airplanes, insufficient tanks, insufficient anti-aircraft guns, and even more because of insufficient factories, unable to make up for the shortcomings. France's defeat was also because the number of allied troops was too small, and there was no way to quickly use the huge reserves of manpower and material resources.

At the beginning of the article, Churchill used a tone that surprised me during the conversation. I asked him why Britain also gave way when sanctioning Italy and allowed Italy to succeed?

He asked, "Have you ever paid attention to the nature of lobsters?" I replied, "I have never regarded the nature of lobsters as a thing."

He said, "Well! If you have the opportunity, you may wish to study it. They are very interesting. Lobsters have to shed their protective shells several times in their lives. During this period of transformation, this bravest crustacean can only lurk in the cracks of rocks and wait patiently. Once the new shell grows, it will protrude from the cracks in the rocks, re-emerge with power, and roam the sea... Due to the rashness and timidity of successive cabinets, Britain has lost its protection, and we have to temporarily lurk in the cracks of rocks, waiting for the new shell to grow strong."

Unfortunately, England and France were forced by the situation to finally protrude from the cracks in the rocks. Before the protective armor was completed, they met their strong enemies on the battlefield. This was also a great misfortune for the two countries!

### Food Prices: Rice Hoarders Refuse to Release Stocks, Rice Prices Drop but Ultimately Rebound

After several consecutive days of declines in the rice market, at the opening this morning, both buyers and sellers were still waiting and watching. It wasn't until the mid-market that some selling began, but the asking prices continued to soften. For example, No. 2 Red Pagoda was only at 87 yuan. New transactions in foreign rice continued to occur. Jian Yuan sold 1,000 tons of No. 2 Saigon, to be shipped in late January and early February, to Xiao Jiao at a price of 88 yuan. Xin Chang also sold 700 tons of No. 2 Saigon, to be shipped in late January and early February, at a price of 85 yuan. The contract prices were similar to those of the previous day. However, although the market showed some weakness, new hoarders took advantage of the low prices to absorb stocks. Holders were also unwilling to lightly release their stocks, as prices had fallen sharply by 4-5 yuan in recent days. General speculators then took the opportunity to stir things up. As a result, as soon as the market stabilized, it was quickly driven up by various buyers, rising step by step. No. 2 Red Pagoda even returned to the 87 yuan mark. At this point, buying and selling were mutually visible, and the situation was slightly stabilized. Profit-takers then took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the market price gradually fell back down. In the end, statistics showed that the city-wide fluctuations amounted to 3 yuan, but the closing price was actually about half a yuan higher than the previous market. No. 1 Saigon was at 85 yuan, 85 yuan, No. 2 at 79 yuan and 3 jiao, then down to 77 yuan. The fire mill special started at 85 yuan, fell to 80 yuan and 5 jiao. No. 2 Siam was at 77 yuan, 76 yuan and a half, Xiao Jiao at 75 yuan and a half, 75 yuan and 2 jiao, rice tea at 72 yuan and 8 jiao, 72 yuan and a half, broken rice at 70 yuan to 69 yuan, and Wuhu Bojian at 73 yuan. In the afternoon, No. 1 Saigon again reached the limit price of 87 yuan, and the fire mill also approached the limit price at 85 yuan and 8 jiao. The backflow Xiao Jiao opened at 88 yuan and then rose from 88 yuan and a half, 88 yuan and 7 jiao to 89 yuan, which was also more than 1 yuan higher. However, by the close of the market, due to new transactions, it returned to 88 yuan and a half. The total amount of spot rice opened for sale throughout the day was 10,000 bags, while the backflow of original bags was only about 300 dun.

The arrival of thick and thin japonica rice and other national rice was still sparse. However, the market has repeatedly declined, and people's hearts have been emptied. Therefore, the morning market continued to be sluggish, and the selling price still fell by 1-2 yuan. Following the surge in foreign rice, the overall sentiment improved. As a result, the situation stabilized. Kunshan Huojian white japonica rice was still at 95 yuan to 92 yuan, special at 98 yuan, and thin indica rice was at 87 yuan and a half, 86 yuan.

After glutinous rice fell short last week, the outflow has been sluggish. Yesterday, this state continued. However, due to the rebound in foreign rice, the owners were unwilling to lightly release their stocks, resulting in sparse transactions and no gains or losses in the market. Yishen white yuan continued to sell at 95 yuan and 93 yuan, and Hong Kong Baiyuan at 85 yuan and 82 yuan.

### A Surge of Foreign Flour: More Than 70,000 Bags Arrived Yesterday, Market Has Begun to Ease

Flour: Yesterday, the price of foreign flour showed signs of loosening. The Australian flour that arrived at the port at the beginning of this month has been sold off one after another. That cargo finally arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and the number of bags loaded was only more than 70,000. Most of them had already been allocated to customers, so as soon as they arrived, there was a rush to pick them up, which was quite busy for a while. Therefore, new transactions were immediately put on hold. It was heard that only 500-600 bags of Flower Bird brand Australian flour were opened in the market at a price of 19 yuan and 3 jiao. Since a ship of American flour will arrive next week, people's hearts are relaxed. There was no change in the situation of flat-price flour, and the two factories still sold more than 6,000 bags at a price of 18 yuan. At present, the combined price of foreign flour is quite favorable. It is heard that Chinese merchants are in contact with the factories to place orders. The local flour market has become the world of foreign flour.

Wheat: Yesterday's transactions were still scarce in both supply and demand. Due to the shortage of raw materials and the difficulty in purchasing foreign wheat due to ships being trapped in port, Chinese factories have raised their purchase prices by another 5 jiao. Japanese factories have also taken the initiative to raise prices to buy, which has caused the market to appear relatively lively, which is different from the trend in the flour market. It is heard that Fufeng Factory purchased more than 200 bags of Kun Du wheat yesterday at a price of 30 yuan and 5 jiao. Japanese factories also purchased 200-300 bags.

### Oil Market: Edible Oil Bulls and Bears Battle

Yesterday's edible oil sales were still sluggish, and the market was still downstream. Therefore, there was little interest in futures, and there was still selling of floating positions, and prices frequently fell. At its lowest, it fell more than 1 yuan compared to the previous day's market. In the afternoon, it was suddenly reported that Japanese firms were covering their positions in the market, which caused people's hearts to move, buying increased, and short covering turned long, and the market atmosphere suddenly became chaotic. The market price changed thousands of times in an instant, and the price difference between the rise and fall in one day reached more than 4 yuan. It is estimated that 1,500-1,600 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded in December, with prices falling from 109 yuan and 5 jiao to 108 yuan and 5 jiao, and finally rising to 112 yuan and 5 jiao at the close. About 700 barrels were ordered for delivery in February, with prices ranging from 108 yuan and 2 jiao and a half to 110 yuan and 8 jiao and 7.5 fen. Only 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were opened for sale in the spot market, with a price of 79 yuan.

In addition, 160 bags of soybeans and 3,704 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong today. Another 300 cans of raw oil were shipped to Little Luzon.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Quiet

Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market conditions. HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate at all. The black market for British and American exchange rates was still unremarkable.

Yesterday's gold market: The dark market for melted red gold continued to weaken. It was heard that the end of this week is the third swap date for converting cash into term transactions. Later, it will be necessary to extend the swap by one month, and the discount rate will inevitably be higher than the previous two sessions. It is rumored that the buying party needs to pay the selling party about 20 yuan. People's hearts in all directions were weakened by this. The market opened at 5,773 yuan and fell to 5,775 yuan. Although a certain bank increased its purchases by 1,200-1,300 taels on behalf of bill traders, it gradually fell under the selling pressure of securities firms, retail investors, etc. In the afternoon, it saw a low price of 5,735 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Both Coarse and Fine Yarn are Needed, Shuangma Wants to Fall but Lacks Strength

Yarn market: weak, and the shape is slightly soft, This is because the profit-taking bulls continue to close their positions, and the shorts come to oppress again, so they have taken a step back, But the amount absorbed by the large firms and foreign customers in the same industry remains unchanged, so the downward trend is very slow, However, the sales of spot yarn are improving, the price of 32 count single yarn is still rising, and the Tianjin gang, which has been silent for a long time, shows signs of increasing purchases of 10 count coarse yarn, There are two pieces of cotton yarn shipped to Singapore, ten pieces shipped to Little Luzon, and one hundred and twenty pieces shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Feather Yarn Satin Rises Again by 2 Jiao – Due to Dyeing Costs

Electric light satin and mercerized feather yarn have sharply increased by 2 jiao per yard compared to last week. This is because most of the inventory has been exhausted. Besides the slightly higher cost of new goods, the dyeing fees have increased after the dyers' strike was declared. Initially, the dyeing fee for feather yarn satin was a flat 6 yuan per bolt, regardless of length. Now, it is limited to 30 yards, and anything over 30 yards is calculated per yard at 1 jiao in legal tender. As a result, the cost has suddenly risen sharply. The commodities with larger inflows and outflows are silks, satins, and tweeds. Silk and satin shops are ignoring the new prices and temporarily holding onto their existing inventory, adopting a passive resistance. Except for those in the Hongkou area, dyeing shops are refusing to accept dyeing jobs unless the new prices are met, creating a confrontational standoff. This forces those who need to sell to anxiously raise prices. As a result, the dyeing business in the Hongkou area has recently seen a boom. The market prices for feather yarn, silk feather yarn, and electric light satin have suddenly risen by 2 jiao.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise due to positive sentiment. The guild's posted price for No. 24 coarse white sugar was 74.5 to 74.8 yuan per picul for foreign godown spot goods, an increase of 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day (November 11).

DY Mark at the West Godown was 70 yuan, and HY Mark at the West Godown was 69.7 to 70 yuan, both up 5 jiao. Spot price for Dutch Red was 57.4 yuan, and at the local godown, it was 57 to 57.2 yuan, with December end-of-month bills at 57.6 yuan, up 5 jiao. Yesterday, 1,950 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

### North-South Goods: Golden Needles Rise by 5 Yuan

Golden needles (dried lily flowers) have recently become scarce, and the market inventory is also low, so the trend has suddenly tightened. High-quality goods have risen by 4 to 5 yuan, and production prices have also risen by 2 to 3 yuan, so market prices have followed suit. The market may tighten further in the future.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Market Forecast to Be Quiet

Recently, the domestic and foreign silk markets have been quite sluggish. Yokohama spot prices have not fluctuated in recent months since falling to 1,350 yuan in mid-October. New York spot prices have also remained unchanged since falling in the past two weeks. It can be seen that spot sales have practically stagnated, and speculative trading has also decreased as a result. The future of the silk market is forecast to be quiet for a period of time, so the local silk market is unlikely to flourish.

### Miscellaneous: Even Sweet Potatoes Are Unaffordable

Sweet potatoes are selling well because of the high price of rice, and their selling price has also risen with the price of rice. A month ago, sweet potatoes were still 5.5 yuan per 100 jin, but soon rose to 7.5 yuan, and now they have risen to 9.5 yuan. As for the retail price in the vegetable market, it has risen from 1 jiao to 1.6 jiao per jin. Therefore, even the very poor cannot afford sweet potatoes.

The market situation for winter bamboo shoots has been interrupted due to the cessation of supplies from Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Ningbo. Only a very small number of Hangzhou bamboo shoots have arrived, so prices are extremely high, once reaching 340 to 350 yuan per dan. Later, as the supply gradually increased, it dropped slightly to around 250 to 280 yuan. Recently, Xiaoshan bamboo shoots have been able to be transported through detours, and the supply continues uninterrupted, so the market price has gradually dropped to between 70 to 80 yuan and 120 yuan per dan. However, because the cost is too high, the price has stabilized. Even if the supply increases further in the future, it is unlikely to fall, and it is still more than doubled compared to the market price in the same period last year. In addition, the supply of canned winter bamboo shoots from Ningbo continues to be insufficient, and the price has soared to 70 yuan per case (containing four dozens), and it is still not easy to buy.

### Metals: Steel and Cement Are Hoarded - Rare Transactions of American Steel

Cement: Recently, cement and steel have been in good demand. The amount stored in Shanghai is very low, and there are no goods coming from overseas, so the traders involved have high expectations and are harboring thoughts of hoarding. Therefore, they are raising prices every day, and increases are seen every step of the way. However, trading with out-of-town merchants remains quiet, with only local construction workers making occasional purchases. Yesterday, the asking price was 1,200 yuan per ton for fine goods, and 1,150 yuan per ton was required for rough and colored goods.

American Steel: The main buyers of steel are canneries, followed closely by printing factories, toy factories, cigarette factories, and biscuit factories. However, due to transportation difficulties for out-of-town merchants, transactions have greatly decreased. Yesterday, only slightly over a hundred boxes were traded. Because actual sales were not smooth, prices did not rise sharply. Old steel factories sold for around 170 yuan, and new steel factories sold for around 160 yuan.

### Economic Miscellany: Dry Tobacco (3)

— Feng Liutang

The English like to smoke pipe tobacco, and it is said that former Prime Minister Baldwin was the most famous for it. It is said that the pipe came about because a scientist used wood to dig a hole to hold tobacco, and often tried smoking it in the laboratory, secretly not wanting people to know. One day, while smoking, a servant barged in and saw the room full of smoke, mistakenly thinking it was a fire, and hastily reported it to the police, and his secret was revealed, and gradually became known, so a wooden pipe was made, which is the origin of the pipe. Although the pipe of pipe tobacco and the pipe of Chinese dry tobacco differ in length and sophistication, their method of use is the same. Why is smoking so popular? It is because it can ward off foul odors, can help digestion, can refresh the mind, and is convenient to carry. Often after a meal, having a cigarette in hand becomes a habit. However, it also has its harms, because tobacco contains nicotine, a poisonous substance. The ancients said that tobacco oil can kill snakes and insects, precisely because there is nicotine in tobacco oil. Nicotine is also known as "tobacco alkali," and good tobacco leaves contain about 2%, while inferior ones contain up to 8%. It is originally a colorless oily liquid, but turns brown when exposed to air. A few drops of pure nicotine can be fatal. Therefore, the tobacco oil from a long-used old pipe can kill a snake when dripped into its mouth. Also, because nicotine is highly stimulating and has an unpleasant odor, it easily damages the brain. Burning tobacco with fire causes the fire to directly impact the throat, causing many diseases of the mouth and throat, hoarseness, all for this reason.

Dry tobacco is produced in various places, but the Yuanqi tobacco from Hangzhou is the best. The tobacco shreds are golden and lovely, and the aroma is sufficient. Some say it is mixed with Eupatorium fortunei pollen (i.e., Eupatorium fortunei), while others say it is mixed with sandalwood powder. However, it is too dry, so it must be slightly moistened before smoking to make the taste more harmonious, but too wet is also inconvenient for smoking. (The End)

### Police Officer Assault Case: Municipal Council Lodges Complaint, Rickshaw License Issue Also to Be Protested, Shanghai West Car Attack Receives Significant Attention

According to the Municipal Council's Information Office yesterday morning (12th), "Regarding the case on the evening of the 8th of this month, where a police officer from the Police Department was disarmed, beaten, and detained by Japanese military police in the area outside the Shanghai West boundary road, the Chairman of the Board has already sent a letter to the Japanese Consul General to lodge a complaint." This marks the second time the Municipal Council has lodged a complaint regarding various developments after the area was blockaded. It is understood that the first resolution, proposed on the 12th, concerned Japanese-owned buses operating in Shanghai West without the Municipal Council's approval, thereby infringing upon the exclusive traffic franchise. It is generally believed that the "Municipal Government's" compelling public concession rickshaw pullers to obtain "municipal licenses" may prompt the Municipal Council to lodge a third complaint. A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated that both protests raised by the Municipal Council had been received and are currently under review, with no immediate comment available.

Content of Protest Still Considered Moderate

Reporters from the Pingming News Agency have learned that the Municipal Council, led by Chairman of the Board, Mr. Kettlewell, delivered a written protest to the Japanese Consul General at 10:00 AM yesterday, lodging a complaint regarding the detention of Municipal Council police officers by Japanese military police on the afternoon of the 8th of this month. The content of the protest has not been released by the Municipal Council. However, according to reliable foreign sources, the Municipal Council based its complaint on the official report of Police Commissioner Major Bown. It is said that the wording of the protest was very moderate, expressing regret over the Japanese military police's actions, which were considered legally unjustified, but did not include requests for apologies, etc.

Japanese Buses Continue Operations

Japanese-owned buses continued to operate on Yu Yuan Road yesterday morning (12th). The Municipal Council has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding this action, which infringes upon the exclusive rights of British-owned buses and tram companies in the western district. They are currently awaiting a response.

Truth of the Car Attack as Reported in Western Media

According to the North-China Daily News, turmoil erupted again in the Shanghai West public concession road extension area last night (11th). The incident occurred around 8:15 PM when a No. 7 bus belonging to the British-owned China General Omnibus Company was traveling along Yih Ting Pan Road near Haig Road. Suddenly, about 30 thugs emerged from the roadside, their purpose not to rob, but to hurl bricks and stones at the bus and smash the windows with iron rulers and wooden sticks. The driver was also mistreated, sustaining minor injuries, but no passengers were injured. By the time police officers arrived, the thugs had scattered. Well-informed sources attach great importance to this matter, as Yu Yuan Road and Da Xi Road have been blockaded, and the British-owned buses operating in the western district are limited to the No. 7 line. Furthermore, the public concession authorities have protested against the Japanese buses operating in the western district. Responsible individuals declined to comment on whether there was a political motive behind last night's violence. The traffic department of the British-owned bus company also declined to disclose any information last night. However, Chinese sources report that two buses were involved in the disturbance. Regarding recent developments in the western district, such as the Japanese authorities erecting new barriers at the intersection of Changping Road and Yanping Road to prohibit all vehicles from passing, the Municipal Council is awaiting an official report from the Police Department.

Car License Issue Under Investigation

The public concession authorities are currently investigating the Japanese authorities' prohibition of public concession rickshaws from entering the Shanghai West road extension area. According to a Municipal Council spokesperson, the detailed circumstances of the matter are still unknown, and they are awaiting a full report from the police officer in charge of rickshaw affairs. Well-informed sources believe that the actions of the Japanese authorities and the "Municipal Government" are clearly aimed at forcing the registration of all rickshaws in Shanghai West. It is reported that plainclothes police officers have been distributing leaflets in the Shanghai West area for several days, notifying rickshaw pullers to obtain "municipal licenses." Although the leaflets stipulated Monday (the 16th) as the deadline, it was suddenly implemented on Wednesday evening (the 11th), catching most rickshaw pullers off guard and preventing them from entering the Shanghai West area.

Curfew Lifted in a Portion of the Area

The curfew originally set for the Shanghai Fourth Blockade Area from Yu Yuan Road to Da Xi Road, starting at 8:00 PM every night, was quietly lifted by the Japanese authorities yesterday without any prior notice. The barbed wire barriers along Yih Ting Pan Road were removed yesterday morning. The Japanese sentries stationed there stated that the search operation in this section has concluded, but the search of other sections is continuing. However, the sentries did not specify the location of these so-called other sections. When the reporter traveled to Di Feng Road, new barbed wire had been erected there, but it was not concentrated in one place, but scattered in a sporadic manner. This shows that the restrictions in the blockade area have been significantly relaxed, and the scope of the blockade has been greatly reduced.

### Rice Industry Extends Delivery Deadline, Declares It Absolutely Invalid, Extension of Delivery Period Suspected of Ulterior Motives, Mr. He De Kui Personally Questioned Yesterday

It was verified that on the afternoon of the 9th of this month, authorities from the two concessions in this city convened representatives from both the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Coarse Grain and Oilcake Industry Association at the Municipal Council to discuss and determine measures for the rice market. It was unanimously decided that from the 12th of this month, all those who purchase rice in the rice market would pay a deposit of five yuan per bag on the same day and would be required to pay for and take delivery of the goods within five days. This measure has already been announced to the public. The aforementioned measures are intended to prevent speculation and stabilize the rice market.

Disregarding Resolutions, Aiding Speculation

However, yesterday's newspapers reported that the aforementioned two associations held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the afternoon of the 11th, and as a result, they resolved that the delivery date for rice grain transactions in the rice market would be based on the resolution of the joint meeting of the two associations on May 8 of this year, that is, the goods would be weighed and cleared within ten days from the date of the transaction. This not only violated the original resolution of the Municipal Council meeting on the 9th of this month but also would be sufficient to fuel the evil practice of speculation in the rice market, which is extremely absurd. In view of this, Mr. He De Kui, Deputy Director of the Municipal Council, believed that strict rectification was necessary to stabilize the rice market. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, he once again summoned representatives of the two associations to the bureau and personally questioned them, ordering them to declare absolutely invalid the resolution of "weighing and clearing within ten days" that was reported in yesterday's newspapers. In the future, they must comply with the resolution of the Municipal Council meeting passed on the 9th of this month, which "limits payment and delivery of goods within five days," and implement it conscientiously, without allowing any loopholes or evasions. If they dare to violate it deliberately, once it is verified, they will be severely punished according to the law. It is heard that the representatives of the two associations have complied with the order.

Rice Prices Rise Again, Future Worrisome

Yesterday, the rice market still failed to stabilize due to the various emergency measures taken by the rice industry groups. Although speculators had once disappeared, they were active in the market again yesterday, causing the price of each grade of foreign rice to be raised by about one and a half yuan per stone. This kind of rapid change in market prices is still very worrying about the evolution of the entire rice market. According to a certain gentleman in the rice industry, before the war, rice prices would only change after three or four days, and the change in price would be small, ranging from a few cents to at most two corners per stone. Now, rice prices can fluctuate by several yuan in one hour, and those engaged in the rice trade are not surprised by this. Therefore, the rice market in the past was established to meet the needs of the public for food, but now it has become a speculative market.

Fellow Townsmen of Wu Prefecture Organize Collective Purchase

The Suzhou Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, in response to members' suggestions, has organized a collective rice purchase. The first batch of one thousand bags is about to be fully subscribed. All fellow townsmen of Wu Prefecture (including Suzhou, Changshu, Wujiang, and Kunshan) companies and individuals can obtain application forms from the association's clubhouse on Xin Zha Road or contact the collection agencies Yanfeng Bank Huazhangfang and Guohua Bank to complete the subscription procedures.

### All Chinese Detectives in the French Concession Issue a Solemn Statement, Demanding Improved Treatment Has No Effect, Chief Chinese Inspector Zhou Shang Yi Transferred to Headquarters

Regarding the matter of improving the treatment of Chinese detectives in the French Concession, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Mr. Blanche, Deputy Director of the French Police Department, summoned three representatives of the Chinese detectives again to hold talks, inquiring one by one about the meaning of the various conditions put forward by the Chinese detectives and the purpose of their strike. The Chinese detective representatives explained sincerely and expressed that the strike was a forced measure and had no other purpose. Mr. Blanche expressed satisfaction and stated that the conditions put forward would be forwarded to the authorities, and a satisfactory reply would be obtained in the short term, and the treatment of Chinese detectives in the French Concession would never be lower than that in the Public Concession, hoping that everyone would be able to perform their duties with peace of mind. Currently, all Chinese detectives in the French Concession are serving as usual, and the order is very good, waiting quietly for the authorities' reply.

Authorities' Reply Under Consideration

It is learned that the conditions put forward by the Chinese detectives were forwarded to Director Fabre by Mr. Blanche, Deputy Director of the French Police Department yesterday. After preliminary research by Mr. Fabre, it will be submitted to the French Consul General today. It is heard that the French Consul General may convene a meeting of the heads of the French Concession to conduct detailed discussions and overall planning. The major reply will be sent to the Chinese detective side in the near future. Among the conditions put forward by the Chinese detectives, there was an original request for the Chief Chinese Inspector to set up an office in the Central Police Station. Although the French side has not replied to the conditions, it has already issued an order yesterday morning to transfer the Chief Chinese Inspector Zhou Shangxi, who is currently stationed at the Songshan Police Station, to work at the Central Police Station, so that he can contact the Chinese detectives and police officers at any time.

Chinese Detectives Express Understanding of the Greater Good

In order to implement the request for improved treatment, all Chinese detectives in the French Concession have organized a Provisional Representative Committee of Chinese Detectives, with one representative elected from each police station to conduct everything. Yesterday, the committee issued a statement to the outside world, saying that the Chinese detectives were forced to go on strike yesterday (the 11th), causing residents in the French Concession to feel uneasy for a while, and deeply apologizing. The purpose of the Chinese detectives' request is purely to improve their lives so that they can cope with the pressure of high prices. There is absolutely no other purpose. The Chinese detectives all understand the greater good and will never be used by any party to put residents in the concession in unease. This can be comforted to all citizens. Before the authorities have replied, the Chinese detectives will serve with peace of mind and will never abandon their duties without authorization. The lives of the Chinese detectives must be improved, but it will be resolved through peaceful means. All citizens will be able to sympathize.

French Side Announces Immediate Resolution

The French Concession Police Department's Information Department yesterday denied the news of the Chinese detectives in the French Concession requesting an increase in subsidies. On Wednesday (the 11th), 15 Chinese detectives from the Xuehuali Road French Chief Police Station went on strike for one hour. There have been no new developments in this matter to date. It is said that the Chinese detectives who went on strike at that time soon returned to their posts, and no requests were made afterward. An information department officer pointed out that the police department staff had been officially notified a week ago that the French Concession Board of Directors was considering improving the treatment of waiters.

### New Drug Industry Will Handle Overstocked Drugs in Vietnam

The Shanghai New Drug Industry Association yesterday issued a notice to member pharmacies, stating: "Dear Sirs, according to member reports, it is said that reliable sources have reported that the Vietnamese authorities are about to auction our Chinese merchants' overstocked goods in Vietnam. If this is true, the losses to our Chinese people will be significant, to say the least. The report in the newspaper that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is handling this matter is completely false. Considering that many of our fellow traders have goods blocked in Vietnam, it is not known whether your association has received this news. It is hoped that you will forward letters to the relevant traders to solicit their opinions on this matter so that plans can be made in advance. In order to save the situation, in our industry's view, the best way is to gather the various cargo owners in our industry and jointly appoint one or two special personnel to go to Vietnam to handle this matter, so as to avoid significant losses. This special letter is issued for notification. I hope you will consider it carefully and reply, etc. The Zhao Association has prepared a special letter to notify your office. If you have any opinions on the above methods, please reply within three days of receiving the letter.

Sir John Latham, the first Australian envoy to Japan, arrived in Shanghai at 3:10 PM yesterday on the British India Steam Navigation Company's ship Nanjing, and stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. At 6:00 PM, he hosted members of the press. Reporters from various newspapers were invited to attend. Regarding his views on whether it is possible to avoid armed conflict in the Pacific, Sir Latham replied that he did not know of any reason why conflict in the Pacific was unavoidable.

Australia and Japan Agree to Exchange Envoys

Sir Latham stated that there are currently no major outstanding issues between Australia and Japan. He stated that Australia cannot ignore any major changes on the eastern coast of the Pacific. He explained that the motivation for Australia and Japan to agree to exchange envoys was to obtain rapid and accurate information.

Always Recognized the Chongqing National Government

When asked whether Australia might send an envoy to the Chongqing Chinese government, Sir Latham replied that this may already be under consideration, but he did not have any definitive information. Regarding the Sino-Japanese war, Sir Latham replied that Australia, like other countries except Japan, has always recognized the Chongqing National Government as the sole legitimate government of China.

Australia Will Fully Support Britain

Sir Latham also discussed the European war, stating that Australia will provide 100% guaranteed support to Britain. Australians are determined not to live under Hitler's new order. Australia's arms manufacturing and agricultural production are self-sufficient. Since the outbreak of the European war, gold production has also increased. After implementing conscription, 250,000 soldiers can be obtained for national defense. 80,000 of them are currently being trained. Aircraft manufacturing is also increasing daily.

Envoy Is Current Chief Justice

Sir Latham pointed out that he is the second envoy in the history of the Australian government. The first one was sent to Washington.

After the First European War, he attended the Paris Peace Conference.

### US New Ship USS Jackson Makes Maiden Voyage to Shanghai Yesterday

The U.S. President Lines new ship, the President Jackson, on its maiden voyage on the Far East route, arrived in port at 9:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Pudong Fourteenth and Fifteenth floating docks, and is scheduled to weigh anchor and depart Shanghai at 11:00 AM today, taking the route through Hong Kong and other places, circumnavigating the globe. Among them, 16 people boarded the ship to come to Shanghai, including several important business leaders of American companies stationed in Japan, who were evacuated from Japan to Shanghai.

Famous American Overseas Chinese Come to Shanghai From Japan

It is reported that among the 16 passengers carried by the ship to Shanghai yesterday, three passengers were famous American overseas Chinese stationed in Japan. One was Mr. Fomen, Deputy Manager of the Japan branch of the American International Telecommunications Bureau, the second was Mr. Powell, a senior member of the American Art Film Company, and the third was Mr. Ford, the Far East reporter stationed in Japan of the American International News Agency. These three famous American overseas Chinese will work in Shanghai in the future. Although the American side did not explain the reasons for their evacuation to Shanghai, it is generally believed that it was because they were unable to continue working in Japan. In addition, there are two other guests, who are also well-known American figures. One is Mr. Kratok, former US Consul in Shanghai and Nanjing, who came to Shanghai to resume his post this time, and the other is Mr. McLane, Deputy Manager of the local Citibank, who had returned to the United States for vacation, and is now returning to Shanghai to cancel his leave.

### Municipal Council States Additional Expenses Exist, But Will Manage Without Raising Any Public Debt, Refuses to Explain Source of Funds

The Municipal Council has recently increased employee subsidies, and monthly expenditures have increased by 935,000 yuan. It is widely believed that the bureau will have to borrow private debt to cope with it. According to a Municipal Council spokesperson yesterday morning (12th), the bureau will be able to cope with this additional expenditure without raising any public debt. However, the spokesperson refused to explain by what means the bureau would cope with it, nor would he specify the funds that would be obtained to cope with the subsidies, whether they were foreign currency or legal tender borrowed from private parties at the stipulated exchange rate.

Experts Suggest Automatic Donation Increase

A financial expert in this city claimed that the Public Concession is currently facing a severe financial crisis, and the blame does not lie with the Municipal Council, but entirely with the taxpayers. Because after the Municipal Council sold the Electricity Department and obtained 82 million taels of silver, for several years taxpayers insisted that this money should be used first, and did not approve of increasing donations. Now that this money has been completely used up, taxpayers will have to increase donations again by at least 15% next year. If taxpayers immediately approve a continued increase in donations, the Municipal Council's financial situation will greatly improve. Taxpayers who want to take this action must convene a special meeting to automatically decide to increase municipal donations before July 1st next year, so as to avoid the Municipal Council incurring other debts again, which will make future difficulties even greater.

### The Japanese Side Levied "Special Fees", Foreign Ships Stopped Sailing the Yangtze River, Shipowners and Merchants No Longer Profitable

The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese Navy implemented a shipping ban on the coast of China in July this year, and the coastal shipping industry suffered a major blow. Only a few foreign merchants in this city still dispatched small ships to sail to the mouth of the Yangtze River and nearby ports. However, the Japanese naval authorities then levied "special fees" on small cargo ships before allowing the goods to be unloaded, resulting in a complete standstill in coastal shipping in the past few days. It is heard that the fees levied by the Japanese authorities are quite high, and the shipowners and charterers are quite disappointed, and have decided to completely suspend sailing. It is learned that foreign coastal ships, regardless of their nationality, must pay a special fee when transporting goods to Shanghai, without exception. This fee is paid by the consignor and the charterer. Recently, a certain foreign ship carrying goods arrived in Shanghai and paid a special fee of 50,000 yuan before the goods were allowed to be unloaded.

### British Overseas Chinese Women's Association Christmas Charity Bazaar Quick Sketch (Below)

A lady in green said to me, "Sir, why don't you give it a try?"

I was standing in front of a table with "Can you use chopsticks?" hanging on it, watching a little girl use chopsticks to pick up small glass balls. On the table were a clock, two enamel plates, - one containing twenty glass marbles, the other empty - and a pair of vermilion chopsticks. After spending two cents, I picked up the glass marbles in the plate one by one into the empty plate, with a time limit of two minutes. The little girl was accustomed to using Chinese chopsticks, and actually picked up five in two minutes.

It was my turn to hold the chopsticks. I thought that I lacked experience in other matters, but I was good at using chopsticks! But the result was only two more than the little girl, which was ashamed. Just as I was about to withdraw, two Western girls came giggling, looking flamboyant. One of them picked up chopsticks and picked at the plate, and the slippery glass marbles refused to obey. The lady in green watched the clock and read, "Half a chain... one minute... one and a half minutes...". The lady next to her couldn't stand it anymore, so she simply grabbed five green onion jade fingers towards the plate, and with a clanging sound, the glass marbles fell into the porcelain plate one by one, causing everyone to laugh incessantly.

The day before yesterday afternoon, Lady Cole had broadcasted on the wireless phone that not only could you buy useful Christmas gifts at the venue, and use money to make useful assistance, but also you could get countless joys at the venue. Her words were indeed correct. Laughter was heard everywhere in the games room, and the children who came there refused to leave.

Returning to the charity bazaar again, it was already 3:30. The British ambassador's wife was leading a group of men, women, and children, singing and celebrating around the Christmas tree. Santa Claus also arrived two weeks early. When the Piaana strings were played enthusiastically, and songs and piano sounds filled the room, I was crowded in the crowd, unable to advance or retreat. I only felt that the chin and cheeks, and the hands were touching fluffy fur coats. Suddenly, I felt a little cold and wet in my wrist. I hurriedly turned my head to look. It turned out that a child was holding a popsicle in his hand and was struggling desperately to get out of the crowd. After struggling for a long time, she was still in the original position, but most of the popsicle had melted wetly.

Squeezing out of the venue door, two primary school students passed me by. One of them pointed to the snack stall across the street and said, "Look! Hot-dog. free!". I thought to myself that there was such a cheap thing in the charity bazaar, why was there no one in front of the stall? But after a closer look, the two primary school students were joking. The food stall clearly wrote, "Sausage sandwich one and a half yuan per guest!". It was already 3:50, and many people were waiting to go inside in the building tea suffocating. The time for the tea room to close is approximately when sandwiches are available. I was relieved.

Turning to the large grandstand, going downstairs to the north, the sound of people gradually thinned, and I felt a little cold on my body. The grandstand was written with: "Winning tickets are exchanged here". People who have been to the grandstand during the racing season always remember these scrums. Walking down the marble escalator from the suffocation room, and walking out of the Majun Road gate, the big clock was pointing at four o'clock. (End)

### American Medical Aid to China Association, Correct the Name

The American Medical Aid to China Association sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, recently, the name 'American Aid to China Association' has appeared in various newspapers, which is quite similar to the fixed Chinese name that our association has always used. I am afraid that people from all walks of life will not understand it thoroughly and will mistake the wrong thing for the right thing, which is easy to cause misunderstandings. It is verified that the official registered English name of our association is (Anetican Bureau for Medical Aidto China Ine.), and its fixed Chinese name is 'American Medical Aid to China Association'. The outside world sometimes refers to it as 'Medical Aid to China Association' or 'Aid to China Association'. This statement is specially made. I hope your newspaper will disclose it on your behalf, and please pay attention to it from all walks of life, so as to avoid confusion and show caution. This is specially requested. I wish you good writing. Sincerely, to Mr. Chief Editor of Shen Bao, Zheng Jiagu, Minister of Propaganda Department of the American Medical Aid to China Association, Qi, November 11th."

### National China Cotton Mill Director Kang Shoufan Abducted Yesterday – Blocked in Front of the Factory Gate and Driven North with His Car

At East Youheng Road, Hongkou, at 10:30 AM yesterday, an abduction case suddenly occurred. The abducted person was Kang Shoufan, the director of the National China Cotton Mill, along with his private car. They sped towards the Hongzhen area in the Chinese district and disappeared. The details are as follows:

Father Old, Son Becomes Factory Director

The National China Cotton Mill is located at 853 East Youheng Road, Hongkou, with a distribution center at 8, Lane 193, Fuzhou Road. The factory was founded by Kang Xitang (in his nineties) from Pudong. His family resides at 14, Lane 270, Jing’an Temple Road (Tongfu Lane). He has five children, one son named Shoufan, who is 25 years old. The rest are daughters; the eldest is already married. Due to recent illnesses, Xitang has entrusted all factory affairs to Shoufan. He has a small Xilimen sedan, license plate number 1666. Yesterday morning, at around 10:30, Shoufan, as usual, drove his car to the Hongkou factory for work.

Three Bandits Blocked the Car and Abducted Him

As he approached the factory gate, three bandits lying in ambush saw Kang’s car approaching and immediately blocked the road with weapons. They ordered him not to make a sound, then boarded the car in single file. One bandit sat next to Shoufan, pointing a gun at his waist, ordering him not to move. Another bandit drove, speeding along East Youheng Road, Maohai Road, and heading straight north towards the Hongzhen Xiangyan Bridge. Although the National China Cotton Mill had a security guard named Yao Miaocun (from Tongzhou, 40 years old), he did not have an official handgun. He witnessed his boss being abducted and rushed back to the factory, reporting everything to the accountant Hu Jingqing. He immediately called the Huishan Police Station, which ordered Chinese and foreign police officers to rush to the scene to investigate and strictly question the security guard about the clothing of the abductors to facilitate the pursuit.

### Cai Tongde Chinese Pharmacy Apprentice Tries to Harm Manager – Breaks into Bedroom at Night and Attempts Electrocution – Manager Wakes Up from Shock and Struggles to Escape

As science becomes more advanced, so do criminal methods. As in the case of Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang killing Zhou Yongjie with electricity, the method used by the two sons was learned from studying radio. Recently, a similar incident occurred. The facts are recorded below. Yao Erqiang, from Ningbo, 20 years old, had been working as an apprentice at Cai Tongde Pharmacy at 455 Henan Road for three years. He usually had a good character. All the money of the store was managed by the manager and accountant, Cai Yuxiang (62 years old) from Ningbo. The safe was also placed in Cai’s room, and the key was kept in Cai’s pocket. However, Yao suddenly had bad intentions. At 3:30 AM on the 11th, Yao, with a scarf covering his face, climbed through the window into Cai’s bedroom. He had prepared an

electrical cord with two-pronged plugs (commonly called "puluo"). While Cai was sound asleep, he inserted one plug into a socket containing electricity, allowing electricity to flow into the cord. Then, he touched the other plug to Cai’s head. Cai woke up from the electric shock and struggled violently, grabbing Yao’s hair with one hand. Yao was also shocked by the electricity. Knowing he was in danger, he quickly pulled out the other plug, cutting off the current. Seeing that his plan had failed, Yao

climbed out the window and fled

back to his own bedroom. At that time, Cai’s head was broken by the electricity, and there was a lot of bleeding. Yao’s scarf and clothes were stained with blood, so he changed them. At dawn, Cai reported to the Central Police Station. Detective Yan Hang and officers Wang Hairu and Zhang Guanying investigated. Yao, fearing exposure, fled. The detectives first arrested his father, Yao Zuqing, and then Yao Erqiang in room 62 of the Anshang Inn at 35, Baliqiao Road in the French Concession. In his room, they found the electrical cord used for the murder and

a scarf and clothes stained with blood. After investigation, it was found that Yao’s motive for the murder was that Cai Tongde had more than 10,000 yuan in cash that day. Yao planned to kill Cai to steal the large sum. Cai Yuxiang’s face was injured and he was sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Yao was sent to the First Special Court, Criminal Division. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, stating that the outcome of the plaintiff’s injuries was still unpredictable, so he requested permission to postpone the trial. Yao Erqiang confessed that his

motive for the murder was a momentary lapse of judgment. As for the reason, he planned to borrow 300-400 yuan from Cai for travel expenses to join the army in Linghua. When asked in court how he learned this method, he replied that he knew it from studying radio. Judge Xiao Xieffen reviewed the confession and ordered Yao Erqiang to be remanded in custody for another week.

However, the factory accountant Liu Changzhou and employee Li Yutang had an unusual idea. They went to Hengli Transit Company, saying that the two bundles of camel wool were the wrong color and needed to be taken back for exchange. They canceled the company’s receipt on the return slip, then hired a car, pretending to return the two bundles of camel wool to the factory. They secretly transported them to the Zhisu Inn on Tianjin Road and stored them in room 7, planning to sell them to foreign goods shops in the city for their own use. However, the accountant of Hengli Transit Company called Dada Factory to inquire. Manager Yu Jietang from Ningbo answered the phone and discovered the case. He reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent Detective Sun Shaokun to the factory. Liu and Li were arrested. After questioning, they revealed the location of the camel wool.

At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, while passing the intersection of Maiyang Road and near Pushi Road in the French Concession, he saw a small red coffin abandoned under the bamboo fence of the vacant lot opposite number 12. Chen immediately went forward, pried open the coffin lid, took out the child’s corpse, and was stripping off the burial clothes to sell them for drug money. It happened that detectives Qin Youyu and Chen Fusheng from the French Police Station were patrolling and saw him. They arrested Chen, took him back to the police station, and investigated the case. They notified the charity and transported the child’s coffin to the coroner’s office. After taking pictures, it was transported to the burial ground for burial.

To the Editor, I humbly report that yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, when I entered Baolong Hospital to visit a patient, I picked up a small wallet outside the gate, containing 12 yuan in cash, two pawn tickets, a laundry receipt, a watch repair shop warranty, and a pack of sewing needles. I immediately asked the people outside the door, but no one admitted to losing it. I believe it was lost by someone passing by.

Although the English lineup is also quite neat, because it is a mob, the Chinese team has a very high hope of victory. I hope the Chinese team members will do their best. The two games on Sunday will be Jewish vs. Russian and World vs. Portuguese. The World Team is a newly emerging organization this year, and its lineup was also announced yesterday. Famous players include Fuen and Pantoson of St. Francis, Cochran and Lileo of Beixitong, and Bale of the French Chamber of Commerce. The nationalities of the players include six countries: America, Greece, Scotland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. The strength is not weak, but if they meet the defending champion Portugal, they may not be able to avoid their poisonous hands. As for the battle between Russia and Judah, Russia lost to Judah by two to four in the previous year. This year, they have been preparing for war, and it is expected that there will be a fierce battle.

Chinese Team

Tai Bigao (Donghua), Li Ning (Donghua), Zhuang Youren (Donghua), Zhang Lingen (Youyou), Liang Shutang (Donghua), Cai Shengsen (Donghua), Huang Kehou (Donghua), Han Longhai (Donghua), Wan Jin (Donghua), Sun Jinshun (Youyou), Dai Linjing (Donghua), Li Yichen (Donghua), Fei Ruihua (Donghua), Jia Youliang (Donghua)

### Catholicism in China: An Overview of Five Major Cultural Undertakings (6) (4) The Aurora Museum

The Aurora Museum, originally named the Musée Heude, was established to commemorate its founder, Father Heude. Construction began in 1867, during the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty. Its initial location was north of the Xujiahui Observatory in Shanghai. In 1934, a new museum was built on a grand scale at the corner of Route Luthy and Route du Père Robert in the French Concession. Today, the Shanghai Municipal Museum has been destroyed. Only the Royal Asiatic Society Museum and the Aurora Museum have survived. The Royal Asiatic Society Museum is more accessible to the general public and has a less rich collection and simpler facilities compared to the Aurora Museum. Therefore, the Aurora Museum currently stands alone in Shanghai. After its foundation by Father Heude, the Aurora Museum was painstakingly managed by Fathers Le Doré, Louys, and Licent. The current director, Father P. Piel, has been tirelessly dedicated, overcoming countless difficulties to achieve the remarkable success seen today. It is no exaggeration to call it the crystallization of the efforts of these priests.

To collect various specimens, Father Heude traveled extensively throughout China, embarking on seven long journeys. He utilized all kinds of old-fashioned transportation, such as screw-driven boats and wheelbarrows. The museum now displays models of these modes of transportation, along with maps of Father Heude's travels, which are quite inspiring to visitors.

Each of the subsequent priests largely focused on one or two categories. For example, Father Le Doré specialized in collecting deer specimens, amassing 3,675 species, the most extensive collection in the Far East. Father Louys, a Doctor of Botany, largely completed the collection of grass specimens from Jiangsu Province. Father Licent, currently a professor at the University of Paris, specialized in insects and also made unique contributions. Father Zheng studied the reproductive behavior of certain insects and discovered that after the female lays eggs, the male lives alone, while the female continues to reproduce without male intervention. After 44 research studies and experiments, he created a diagram and specimen of this parthenogenetic reproduction, which is exceptionally exquisite. The priests also collaborated on the study of mollusks. In addition to jointly discovering over 700 species, Father Heude individually discovered 572 species. His writings on Chinese natural history are the most abundant.

The museum has three floors, each with two large halls. The ground floor is the antiquities section, displaying jade, porcelain, and bronzes from various Chinese dynasties, dating back to the Shang and Zhou Dynasties. The collection is comprehensive and includes many rare items not commonly seen elsewhere. For example, the burial garments of Chong Kai, Huang Anguo, who passed away in 1684 during the reign of Emperor Kangxi, are still intact and well-preserved. The museum acquired these items and specially made wooden figures to wear the garments for display, which is quite remarkable.

The first floor is the animal specimen room, divided into mammal and bird sections. The second floor houses fish, mollusk, insect, and plant specimens. The first and second floors contain 3,435 bird specimens, 6,375 animal specimens, 51,600 plant specimens, 200,000 insect specimens, 1,300 mollusk specimens, and 200,000 other specimens. There are also 2,000 to 3,000 specimens of turtles and animal skeletons, which have not yet been sorted due to the lack of dedicated personnel. In addition, there are research and testing rooms, as well as a library, all equipped with excellent facilities.

Before the war, the museum often received donations of hunted animals. However, there have been no new acquisitions since the war. Last year, the museum sent staff to Chahar, but they were forced to return due to the war. Fortunately, the items they had obtained were safely transported to Shanghai. According to the museum's research, there are over 100 million known insect species in the world, and an equal number of unnamed species. New animal species discovered by the museum are often sent to various countries for identification, including Berlin, Vienna, Java, Paris, and San Francisco, which have established contact with the museum. In 1935, the museum discovered 33 new insect species worldwide and 22 new species in China. The museum primarily studies Hymenoptera and Hemiptera insects, and new discoveries of these insects from around the world are sent to the museum for identification as part of academic exchange. A total of three species were identified in 1935. The museum has also created 195 original watercolor models of protozoa.

### Shanghai Children's Welfare Society Charity Sale of Paintings, Calligraphy, and Goods

Three-Day Event Starting Today at the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute and the Beggar Children's Education Center, located on Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot, and the newsboy schools throughout the British and French Concessions are reasonably well-established but require significant monthly expenses. This charity sale has been in preparation for over a month and has required considerable effort. Fortunately, it has received assistance from renowned calligraphers and painters such as Ma Gongyu, Wang Yachen, Shi Chongpeng, Bai Jiao, Li Qiujun, Feng Wenfeng, Chen Xiaocui, Pang Zuoyu, Zhou Lianxia, Zhong Shouzhi, Wang Shiru, and Bao Yahui, as well as major domestic goods manufacturers, making its success possible. It is scheduled to be held continuously for three days, starting today (13th), at the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge, from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM each day. It is hoped that those who are passionate about protecting children will generously donate to benefit society significantly. A description of all the paintings, calligraphy, and goods is provided below:

(1) Collaboration Fan by Ma and Wang: The calligraphy of Ma Gongyu and the paintings of Wang Yachen are renowned throughout the country. Those who obtain them should treasure them. In addition to donating a large number of fine works, they have specially created a collaborative fan with ten pages for collectors to choose from.

(2) Special Donation by Shi Chongpeng: The renowned painter Shi Chongpeng has been immersed in landscape painting for decades, and his skill is exquisite, as recognized by connoisseurs. He has generously donated ten works, all of which are meticulously crafted and not easily obtained.

(3) Grand View of Western Paintings: Yan Wenliang, a veteran of Western painting, has not only generously contributed his own masterpieces but has also selected over a hundred outstanding works by teachers and students from the Suzhou Fine Arts School, showcasing the best of Western painting. This is truly remarkable.

(4) Assortment of Goods: The goods that companies and manufacturers have already sent include Liang Xinji's toothbrushes, which are strong and durable; cosmetics from the Family Industry Cooperative, which rival foreign products; Xiang embroidery from Sino-American, which is exquisitely crafted; toys from Wing On and Sincere; towels from Yue Chong Cheong; soap from Dah Sing Chemical Works; rattan crafts and socks from the You You Education Center; slippers and carpets from Pu Yi Crafts Cooperative; thermos bottles from Lip Hing Cheung Factory; and silk and velvet flowers from Yue Chang Kee. All of these are made of high-quality materials and are superior to ordinary products.

(5) Antiques and Ancient Paintings: The society has discreetly acquired fine porcelain, ancient bronzes, Chen inkstones, old stone seals, and paintings by Wang Shigu, Gai Qixiang, Wu Xingfen, and others from collectors. These items are full of ancient charm and are suitable for appreciation.

The staff of the society have been working tirelessly and diligently to organize the charity sale, and with the sincere assistance of various parties, they have achieved today's successful results, which is truly commendable.

Chronicles

### Mr. and Mrs. George

— Water Log

"George, Miss Zhang and the others send their regards."

Throwing her handbag onto the small round table, she turned to take off her coat. The long rectangular dressing mirror revealed a sharp-featured woman's face: high cheekbones, slightly upturned lips, proud but slightly melancholy eyes...

No response. Glancing sideways in the mirror: the dim green electric light illuminated George sitting blankly on the sofa, his yellow cheeks propped in his hands, lost in thought. Her upturned lips pouted slightly.

Suddenly, she slithered over like a snake, sat on the arm of the sofa, and uttered a silvery voice: "Darling, what's wrong?"

Silence. The clock chimed eight times, precisely. Tree shadows frolicked on the pale red curtains.

"Nothing. Nothing." His deep eyes stared straight at the curtains, or perhaps at some distant place behind them.

"You're lying. I know! Is it because I've been coming home late these past few days? But it's so annoying, those people! Reading to them for free, and they still skip class, and we have to send people to visit them! The association held a big meeting for that women's night school. Miss Chen, the principal of the night school, ran over to report to us: 'The effect of the visits is unexpectedly bad: a few came, but most said they were busy and couldn't come for the time being. One simply told the visiting staff member at her home: "It's useless, I'm not going to study anymore." and went back to sticking her foil.'" Those dead people, on the first day of class they asked: 'Teacher! When will I be able to write letters?' 'I just need to be able to do accounts!'"

His deep eyes stared straight at the curtains, or perhaps at some distant place behind them.

The woman gently nudged him again, "Hey, school board member! Let me tell you another funny thing: Miss Huang told me that in one civics class, she said to those people: 'Don't spit everywhere, blow your nose into a handkerchief.' Immediately, someone stood up and asked: 'Teacher! What if I don't have a handkerchief?' Can you imagine how funny that is?... Ugh, Darling, I haven't spent time with you for days. So annoying! I say, if they don't come, let them go, honestly, we'll confiscate the one dollar deposit they each paid! Miss Zhang and the others all agreed with me, but Miss Hu didn't approve. She said: 'The key issue is that they don't have money, they're poor! Poverty is a sin, we should sympathize with them. Therefore, we can only try our best to guide them, teach them what they need most and what is easiest to accept in their living environment.' Ha! Who can't give a high-sounding speech? You go do it!... Ugh, enough! Wait a while, after dinner, I'll take you to the movies."

The sound of leather shoes "clack-clacking" came from the doorway. "Mom! Mom!"

"What's wrong? Oh dear! So much sweat! How did you get so dirty?" Old Tang, who was walking behind, explained breathlessly.

"Young Master wants to eat, I said Shao Nai didn't order it, so of course I can't serve him. Young Master then—"

"Of course?" Her upper lip curled. "Old Tang, I'm telling you: if your child is sick, you can find a replacement worker, it's not right to be so muddleheaded. Look, what have you done to your clothes? You can't blame me—"

Suddenly, "ding-ding-ding"—the telephone on the lampstand rang!

"Hello!... Who is it? Oh, Miss Zhang! Yes!... Nothing much!... Okay. I'll be right there!" She hung up the phone. "Miss Zhang wants me to go play mahjong right away. Miss Huang and Miss Chen too, three are short one, I can't refuse!"

She hurriedly put on her coat. Opening her handbag, she took out something and, facing the small mirror on the handbag, dabbed it on her face, eyebrows, and lips. Seeing Old Tang still standing beside her, she said: "Why haven't you served the meal yet?"

"I—I wanted to borrow a few dollars from Shao Nai!"

"What? You know I'm going to play mahjong and you're asking me for money?" She loudly snapped her handbag shut and ran to the door. "Goodbye, Darling! Goodbye, Sonnie! Oh, I can't take you to the movies tonight again, so annoying!"

The door "slammed" shut.

"Mom! Mom!" George listlessly raised his head. "Johny, come here to Daddy. Come!" Seeing that John didn't move, he could only "act as both father and mother"...

Old Tang shook her head and sighed.

### Watching

— Sanren, Painting by Gou Sheng

Someone was absentmindedly gazing at the sky, and the person behind him came up to him. Then, passersby also stopped, and gradually a large crowd of people were watching the sky. What are they looking at? No one knows.

"Accusing the Heavens" - what's so interesting about that? Yet a large crowd of people gathered around. "Do a good deed," but no one contributes a penny. In short, you watch, I watch, everyone watches.

"A Fire" is naturally even more interesting to watch, but people don't have the courage to get too close. It's best if the fire burns as brightly as possible, and one can stand as far away as possible, which is called "watching a fire from across the river," how carefree!

This is still just "watching." There are also those who want to take advantage of the situation, or even say they are trying to "rob a burning house." Let me give an example. Ah, I have one. Everyone probably remembers the grand spectacle of the coronation of the English king. The police whips fell on the people in the front row, and the people behind them created an unprecedented page of "social news"!

You watch, I watch, everyone watches, but no one watches with a long-term perspective.

### Life

— Guangli

Wang Niu (Wang Cow) was born in the year of the "Ox." He has a blind mother, and he needs to keep her alive, so he asked someone to recommend him to work in a factory. Every day, before dawn, he gets up and goes to work. When he arrives at the factory, he buries himself in the machine room and works hard, even though it is still dark.

Mr. Li, I forget how old he is this year, but anyway, he was born in the year of the "Dog." He has a wife and a son, and he needs to keep his whole family alive, so he took the exam to become a clerk in the factory. Every day, he gets up at seven o'clock, takes the streetcar, and rushes to the office, where he starts work at eight o'clock.

Old Zhao is said to have been born in the year of the "Tiger." He has a wife and another concubine. He is the director of this factory. Every day, he gets up at ten o'clock, takes his private car, and goes straight to the factory. In the director's office, he drinks tea and eats breakfast, then picks up a newspaper and reads the day's news.

Manager Zhang was born in the year of the "Dragon." He has one wife and two concubines. Prospective dancing girls are not included. He gets up around eleven o'clock every day. After saying goodbye to his wives, he gets in his car and speeds to the factory. He steps into the manager's office, as usual makes a few phone calls, and purchases theater tickets or inquires after the dancing girls - just "official business."

At two o'clock in the afternoon, Manager Zhang leaves in his car.

At four o'clock in the afternoon, Director Zhao leaves in his private car and does not return.

At six o'clock in the evening, the clerks get out!

At eight o'clock in the evening, the big gate is opened and dozens of workers are released.

The god of sleep is equal to all:

Wang Niu has his blind mother by his side.

Mr. Li has a wife and son to keep him company.

Director Zhao has his wives on both sides protecting him.

Manager Zhang has one wife and two concubines surrounding him, so he is not only unlikely to get cold, but when he can't sleep in the middle of the night, he can get up and play another four rounds of mahjong.

### Willow in Zhangtai

— Gu Mingdao

On the Qingming Festival, spring returns to the earth, the green waves on the river are clear and rippling. Zhang Tianru was very happy and wanted to take the Liu sisters on a boat trip to Qingxi and visit Jingyuan to see Ni Nanyun. Liu Ru Shi could not refuse her teacher's kindness, so she went on the trip with Zhang Tianru. When they arrived at Jingyuan, it so happened that Ni Nanyun had gone to Suzhou. The host was not there and was entertained by the servants. Zhang Tianru could not help but feel disappointed, so he had to walk around the garden. Liu Ru Shi was concerned about the drunken man in the boat, and repeatedly urged Zhang Tianru to return to the boat. Zhang Tianru then gave money to the servants and walked back to the boat with the Liu sisters. They saw that Shi Da was still sitting in the cabin, eating in a mess. Aunt Xu whispered in Liu Ru Shi's ear, "You went to the garden by yourselves, but left a strangely shaped beggar drinking in the boat. One pot after another, his belly seems to be connected to the sea, he has drunk at least eight or nine pounds of wine. The dishes are all eaten, but he asked us for peanuts to drink with the wine, and he has already eaten a pound of peanuts. He refuses to leave, what are you keeping him for? I have never seen such charity to a beggar." Liu Ru Shi smiled slightly, called out "Mother," waved her hand and said, "This beggar is different from the others, mother, don't grumble, we will send him away." Liu Ru Shi finished speaking and walked into the middle cabin with Zhang Tianru and Jiangzi. When Shi Da saw them coming back, he put down his wine glass and cupped his hands to them, saying, "Are you back? Thank you for inviting me to drink. I have been rude and drunk a lot, and I dare not disturb you any more. I am very grateful for your kindness, and I will repay you if I have the opportunity in the future. I am originally from Hebei, and I have been wandering around the world for ten years. I have been busy with the wind and dust, and it is difficult to find a confidant. People treat me like a beggar. I think that now, in general, princes and adults are unscrupulous and shameless, and they are just begging for wealth, so it is better to honestly beg. Although I would like to tell you about my life experience, there is no way to start. When I was young, I used to be with Robber Zhi, but I have long repented and put down the butcher's knife, so I have become penniless. I hope you won't laugh at me." After speaking, he put the remaining wine in the pot to his mouth and drank it all up. He smacked his lips and said, "Good wine, good wine, I haven't had such good wine for a long time." Just as Zhang Tianru and Liu Ru Shi were about to speak, Shi Da suddenly put down the wine pot, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, said "excuse me," cupped his hands to them again, strode out of the cabin, and with a light leap, he reached the shore. He took a big step and ran eastward as if flying. In the blink of an eye, his burly back was gone. Liu Ru Shi watched him leave, and could not help but sigh, "In ancient times there were yellow-shirted, curly-bearded people, this person is a similar type, which is endearing." Zhang Tianru also said, "What a heroic man! It's a pity that he didn't get his chance." At this time, the sun had set in the west, and the waves reflected the sunlight, making it golden yellow. The evening breeze brushed their sleeves, and they still felt the chill of spring. The group returned home in the shadow of the setting sun. (8)

### Outstanding Amongst the Four Great Young Female Dan Performers, Li Shifang Will Reappear on Stage

— Zhiwen

Zhang Junqiu Decides to Give Up Forming a Troupe, The Authenticity of Wanli's Recognition of His Son Is Uncertain

(Beijing Correspondence) Apart from Li Shifang, the other four great young female Dan performers in the former capital, such as Zhang Junqiu, Song Dezhu, and Mao Shilai, have all shown considerable talent. Before the "July 7th" Incident, Shifang was the most active figure among the child actors. After being selected by the Liyan Daily as a top-ranked actor, his reputation increased tenfold. At that time, Zhang Junqiu, who was performing with Lei Xifu, was still unknown. Song Dezhu only performed martial Dan roles in drama school. Although she occasionally performed Hua Dan roles, her skills were mediocre. Mao Shilai's performance of Hua Dan and martial roles was quite impressive, but his position was inferior to that of Li Shifang. In the Fu Society's unique plays such as "The Drunken Beggar" and "Jin Ping Mei," Shifang played the main role, while Shilai was in a supporting role. When Shifang was on the rise, his voice unfortunately changed and he could no longer sing, which was a big blow to him. In the past three years, he has spent a lot of effort on treating and conditioning his voice. He went to Peking Union Medical College Hospital and also consulted famous doctors. At the same time, he practiced martial arts every day. This was all in an attempt to return to the stage. Now, Zhang, Song, and Mao are known both north and south, while Shifang has gradually been forgotten. Whenever he thinks of this, he works even harder to hone his skills, hoping to compete with them in the future.

Heaven does not disappoint those who work hard. Shifang did not waste his efforts, and his voice finally came back. His father and friends were so happy. Under the urging of various parties, Shifang finally formed a troupe after two months of preparation. However, regarding the roles, in order to strengthen the lineup, there were repeated changes. The old male role was originally set to be Guan Chengxi, but now it has been replaced by Chen Shaolin; the martial role Yang Shengchun replaced Gao Shenglin, and the painted face role is still the old partner Yuan Shihai. When they were in the Fu Society, every performance of "Farewell My Concubine" was a full house. Shifang's Yu Ji and Shihai's Overlord were evenly matched, and their singing and acting were excellent. After Shihai graduated, the Overlord was played by Ye Shengmao, which was not as good. As for the young male role, it is played by Jiang Miaoxiang. In addition to "Jin Ping Mei" and "The Legend of the Kunlun Swordsman," Shifang's plays are all based on Wan Hua. Miaoxiang is Wan Hua's hard match, and Shifang's invitation to him to participate allows him to learn at any time, which is naturally very beneficial. The clowns are Sun Shengwu and Ai Shiju, who are also up-and-coming stars. The original manager was Yuan Shihai, but he is currently staying in Shanghai and it is not known when he will be back, so Shifang has temporarily hired Li Huating, a star from the Tianjin China Theatre, to serve as manager. The troupe is named "Chengfang Society," and Shifang is the president. The date of the performance has been set for New Year's Day next year. Now, various theaters are vying to invite them.

Since Zhang Junqiu's marriage, in view of Li Shifang's formation of a troupe, he also had the intention of taking on a major role alone. However, when he thought of Song Dezhu's words "I've had enough of forming a troupe," he couldn't help but feel discouraged. Forming a troupe is not an easy task. Finding the right actors is difficult, but dealing with all kinds of troublesome affairs is even more headache-inducing. Moreover, Ma Lianliang is very good to him, and he is embarrassed to leave. In Tianjin, the voice of Junqiu forming a troupe is getting louder and louder. The Grand View Garden Theater sent someone to Ping to invite him to perform, but he politely declined. According to his statement, he has now given up the idea of forming a troupe and will continue to perform with Lianliang's "Fufeng Society" because he is not sure that he can make money by forming his own troupe.

In addition, there is another event that has caused a sensation in the Pingjin drama scene, which is "Zhang Junqiu does not recognize his biological father." Before and after Junqiu's marriage, an old man came to the former capital from Shanghai, claiming to be Junqiu's biological father. It is said that Junqiu's father saw through the world when Junqiu was very young and went into the deep mountains (in Zhejiang). Now that Junqiu is enjoying a great reputation in the drama scene, and also because he misses his son, he went from Shanghai to Ping to request adoption. Junqiu thought that this old man came suddenly and there was no evidence, so he offered to pay 400 yuan to settle this dispute, but his father refused. Another version is that his father served as a section chief somewhere during the Zhili-Anhui warlord era, and was later arrested for something. It was not until the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived in Tianjin that he was released. When he returned home, his nest had been occupied, and with anger, he went to Chun Shen. As for whether these two legends are true, outsiders have no way to prove it. However, we hope that this entanglement can be resolved reasonably and fairly. (Sent on November 8th)

### Bai Yang, Gu Eryi and Others Actively on Stage: Song Zhi's New Work "Punishment" to be Performed in Chongqing

(Chongqing Dispatch) The China Electric Drama Troupe was established a year ago, and "Combat" was their debut performance. Following that, they assisted various drama troupes with indirect work and initiated numerous rural drama movements. Last winter, while accompanying the "China Electric" "Ten Thousand Miles of Azure Sky" location shooting team to Yunnan to film outdoor scenes, they performed plays such as "Dancing Demons" and "Frontier Storm" in Kunming. After returning to Chongqing this spring, they focused on completing various documentary films for "China Electric" itself, as well as the interior scenes for "Ten Thousand Miles of Azure Sky," which were urgently needed. Furthermore, they had lost their performance venues due to repeated bombings, resulting in a period of silence for more than half a year.

Recently, to launch the winter drama movement and to respond to the Central Party Headquarters' donation efforts for orphans, they selected Song Zhi's "Punishment," Zhang Min's "Night," and Ge Yihong's "Red Tassel Spear" in the initial preparatory meeting. These three plays will be performed separately in the short term, with "Punishment" as the premiere performance. The central theme of "Punishment" addresses the most serious current issues of rice and grain, and conscription. It will be directed by Zhang Min. The selection of the performance committee members and the allocation of actors have been finalized. The venue has been decided to be at the "Cathay," with the date set for December 20th.

As for the plays "Night" and "Red Tassel Spear," it has been decided that Shen Xiling and Sun Shiyi will be the directors, and they are also in the planning stage.

The "Punishment" performance committee consists of thirteen members: Luo Xuelian, Bai Yang, Shen Xiling, Yu Zhongying, Xu Suling, Xu Angqian, Shi Chao, Gao Zhanfei, Sun Yu, Qiu Yiwei, Pan Zinong, Wei Heling, Gu Eryi, and others.
