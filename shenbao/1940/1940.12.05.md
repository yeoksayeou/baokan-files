### Ambassador Guo Visits the British Foreign Office; Britain Will Continue to Provide Loans to Aid China Following the US; Opinions Have Been Exchanged with Canada; The Soviet Union Guarantees Aid to China and Will Not Enter into Treaties with Japan

London – Yesterday, leaders of the Foreign Office met with the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors stationed in London, causing a great stir in British diplomatic circles regarding Far Eastern issues. Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu visited Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, while Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi held talks with diplomatic officials. It is understood that Shigemitsu visited of his own volition, attempting to explain the "Japan-Nanjing Treaty" and reaffirming Japan's repeated pledges to earnestly avoid friction with Britain and the United States. British officials anticipate that this treaty will be followed by further threats to the rights and interests of foreigners in Chinese-occupied areas, especially in Shanghai and treaty ports. Shigemitsu's conversation with Halifax apparently failed to alleviate British anxiety over this issue. British officials welcomed President Roosevelt's announcement of substantial new economic assistance. Ambassador Guo Taiqi also emphasized the willingness of Britain to provide new export loans to China. Britain is unconditionally happy to increase aid to China, but given that Britain itself has dramatically increased its wartime burden by aiding Greece, Turkey, and Egypt, the difficulty of the matter cannot be concealed. These obstacles may be somewhat reduced by obtaining the consent of British colonies to assist China. It is believed that London has exchanged views on this matter with Canada.

Stockholm – According to a report from the British News Agency, after the recent large loan from the United States to the Chinese government, those concerned in London are now also discussing the possibility of providing credit loans to Chongqing, with China supplying tungsten and antimony as collateral, as these minerals are needed by the British munitions industry. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 4th)

London – Due to the late arrival of the news of the US loan to China, Sunday's newspapers did not comment on it, but the Observer and the Reynolds News described the matter prominently. The front page of the Reynolds News also carried news of Foreign Secretary Halifax discussing war issues and rapid British-American cooperation in aiding China with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. The Reynolds News political correspondent stated that reports from the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, and the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, have confirmed that the Soviet Union will continue to aid China and will never enter into any treaties with Japan that are hostile or provocative towards the United States. (Dispatch from the 4th)

Washington – US Secretary of State Hull declared that matters concerning the loan to China will henceforth be handled by the Treasury Department and the Export-Import Bank. Hull and Song Ziwen, Governor of the Central Bank, have already completed their discussions and will not hold any more meetings in the short term. The loan has already been approved by the joint meeting of the relevant committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)

Washington – Yesterday's editorial in the Washington Star stated that if the "veiled threats" issued by Domei News Agency are true, then a major crisis in US-Japanese relations may not be far off. Domei News Agency recently stated that Japan and "Nanjing" may have to adopt drastic measures to deal with the United States, so the Star commented that while Japan's recognition of the "Nanjing regime" may be a farce diplomatically, it is also a serious and dangerous event. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)

Tokyo – Japanese newspapers in Tokyo continue to vehemently attack the US loan to China. The Miyako Shimbun called the loan an "unforgivable act of war" and stated that Japan may be forced to accept the challenge from the United States in order to protect Japanese interests and national honor. The Asahi Shimbun urged the Japanese government to resolve the Thai-Indochinese conflict in order to maintain its position as "leader of East Asia" and prevent Britain and the United States from "profiting from it." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)

Chinese Military Has Made Progress; Financial Position Is Becoming More Solid

Washington – Financial experts here stated yesterday that they believe that Song Ziwen's success in obtaining the cooperation of the US Treasury Department will break through the recent mistrust of Chinese finances in Shanghai and other commercial ports. Song Ziwen and Hu Shi, the ambassador to Washington, have both striven to obtain a $50 million loan from the United States and the official expression that another $50 million will eventually be provided to consolidate Chinese finances. Financial experts further stated that although China's military position has improved, a lack of confidence is the main factor affecting the Chinese currency. The foreign exchange market in Shanghai is practically unrestricted, as the National Government under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek lacks regular national measures to restrict financial transactions and controls. The purchase of Chinese currency by Japan in various places to obtain foreign exchange is another reason for the decline in the Chinese yuan. Experts pointed out that the Sino-Japanese war and Japan's control of Chinese exports have restricted the export of goods, but this has little impact on the currency. The lack of factory goods has reduced exports, and Japan is also seizing raw materials shipped abroad. Authorities believe that the loan from the US Export-Import Bank will enable China to purchase more US raw materials and stabilize the legal tender. It is understood that Song Ziwen did not go to the Ministry of Finance yesterday to negotiate. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)

Chongqing Newspapers Continue to Praise the United States; Welcome the Dispatch of Experts to China

Chongqing – Newspapers here have recently continued to praise the US loan to China and especially welcome the dispatch of military and technical experts. Well-informed sources believe that the new loan strengthens China's morale and resistance, and that the American artillery and aircraft are needed to determine the struggle. They also stated that in order to facilitate the supply of American armaments to China, the area along the Burma Road and various airfields must be used as transport stations, and Chinese experts must be responsible for this important work. It was also stated that Chinese aviators have demonstrated excellent ability in the past eleven months, but they still need to cooperate with ground artillery personnel. Everyone here believes that US aid to China is a wise plan, and that the United States is currently paying a low insurance premium to maintain peace in the Pacific. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)

### British and American Cooperation in the Far East; To Be Discussed in the House of Commons

London – The British House of Commons will now raise a very interesting question regarding British-American cooperation in the Far East, requesting the government to respond as soon as possible. Conservative Party member Morgan intends to suggest that Britain and the United States should jointly declare their opposition to the new order that Japan seeks to establish, not only in China but throughout the Pacific. Conservative Party member Conway will also ask the British government whether it can reiterate its policy towards the Nanjing regime to show that British and American objectives in the Far East are the same. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)

### Anti-American Incidents Occur in Various Parts of Japan; The United States Has Called the Attention of the Japanese Foreign Ministry

Tokyo – People here believe that the recent anti-American incidents in Japan are an organized movement by the Japanese to expel all foreigners from Japan. The incident on Monday at noon, where a Japanese person threw two baskets of excrement at the US Embassy in Tokyo, was not the first anti-American incident. A similar incident occurred in Kobe this summer, and the American consulate there was the target of the Japanese. In October and November, many disturbances occurred in the Hiroshima area, such as the publication of anti-American announcements in newspapers, the throwing of stones at American churches, and the forced entry into American church properties. On November 14, a group of Japanese rioters smashed the windows of the Hiroshima Girls' School, which has been run by Americans for fifty years, with large stones. On the same day, a group of Japanese thugs rioted in front of the American church, and advertisements with words such as "schools related to blockades and espionage," "expel foreign teachers of the Fifth Column from the country," and "resist Christian schools established by the enemy" have been found in newspapers such as the Nichinichi Shimbun. Currently, six female teachers at Hiroshima Girls' School have resigned and gone to Kobe and Osaka to recuperate. The remaining eight American professors are all Christians. The school authorities believe that their continued efforts seem impossible, because the students of the school are under pressure to continue their studies and stop studying at the school. What a Japanese person did at the American Embassy on Monday was witnessed by a female secretary. As a result, the US Embassy called the attention of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and requested that police be sent to protect the residence of US Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew. The female secretary said that she personally saw the Japanese person throw the excrement inside the walls of the embassy and immediately flee. Afterwards, the Japanese police patrolled the neighborhood all day to prevent accidents. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)

### British Far East Commander-in-Chief Issues Statement; Criticizes British-Japanese Relations; Cannot Guarantee Peace

Singapore – Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, the new Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Command, told a reporter from the Singapore Min Sheng Pao, which is run by the Japanese, today that although he is responsible for preparing for the eventuality that the war will extend to Malaya, he will do his best to prevent it. The reporter also asked for his criticism of British-Japanese relations, and he replied that there is no reason for a conflict. However, he cannot guarantee peace. Although there is no reason to panic at the moment, what happened in Europe could also happen in Asia. Finally, he answered questions about the preparedness of Malaya to resist, saying that Malaya can make it very difficult for the aggressor. The current position is capable of repelling any attack. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)

### Kiichiro Hiranuma Enters the Cabinet Again

Tokyo – Authorities announced today that former Prime Minister Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma will be appointed as a minister without portfolio in the current cabinet on Friday. Many believe that Hiranuma's entry into the cabinet will strengthen the position of the government. Hiranuma resigned on August 19 last year after the conclusion of the German-Soviet Pact. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)

### Chinese Side Expresses Satisfaction with Germany's Attitude Towards Nanjing; Will Benefit Sino-German Relations; Abe Will Resign and Return to China Within the Month

Chongqing – Germany issued a message yesterday stating that it has no intention of recognizing the "Nanjing regime" at present. Upon hearing this, people here expressed satisfaction, saying that according to the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, even if the signatory countries maintain close relations with each other, they can still maintain different relations with third countries. Well-informed sources said that if the above message is confirmed, then Sino-German relations will definitely benefit. (Havas dispatch from the 3rd)

London – London Radio announced today that although Japan has signed a treaty with the Wang Jingwei regime in Nanjing, Germany will continue its diplomatic relations with the National Government in Chongqing. Tokyo has not yet had any formal reaction to Germany's non-recognition of the Wang regime. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)

Tokyo – It is heard that General Abe will resign from his position as ambassador to Nanjing and set off to return to China within the month. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)

### The Greek Army's Victory Has Far-Reaching Repercussions; Japanese Confidence in the Axis Powers Is Gradually Shaken

Washington – The victory of the Greek army in yesterday's war has had repercussions as far away as the Pacific. It is clear that Tokyo is now concerned about this. Well-informed diplomatic circles here believe that Japan will not take further steps to pursue any plans against the Dutch East Indies until the European political situation becomes clearer. People here believe that Japan joined the Axis powers because it believed that the Axis powers would win. Now that it has seen the unfavorable situation in Asia, it has suspended its plans for major actions near Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)

London – The manager of the London branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank recently expressed the opinion that the Japanese people are tired of war, have begun to expose German propaganda, and are gradually believing that Britain will win the war. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels has released a thick smoke screen in the world, and even Japan has been deceived by it. They are only now realizing that Hitler's invasion of Britain has failed. They recalled that Hitler had declared that he would arrive in London in August, September, and October, but he has not yet done so. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)

### President Roosevelt Sails on a Ship; Allocates Funds to Develop Bases

Miami – Roosevelt continued to travel by special train here yesterday afternoon. Immediately after arriving here, he transferred to the cruiser USS Tuscaloosa to patrol the Caribbean Sea. The destroyer USS Maury and USS Dupont escorted the president's ship. When the president departed, thousands of people gathered on the shore to cheer. The President is scheduled to return to the capital around December 15th and told the press before leaving that this trip was entirely for official business, meaning that it was not a fishing trip. This journey may stop at Jamaica, near the British naval base there. The United States has recently obtained a naval base from Britain. In addition, he may visit Culebra Island on December 7, where US Marines are currently conducting exercises. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)

Washington – The Army Department announced today that President Roosevelt has allocated $25 million to the Army for the development of the air and naval bases recently leased by Britain. (Reuters dispatch)

Editorial

### The United States Intensifies Aid to China and US-Japanese Relations

Looking at the various developments in the Pacific in the past six months, there is reason to believe that the state of anarchy in the Far East is gradually becoming a thing of the past. Every new attempt at aggression or step taken is immediately met with major countermeasures and can no longer be carried out arbitrarily as in the past. For example, when Japan concluded an alliance with Germany and Italy, the United States and Britain immediately announced loans to China and embargoes on Japan, as well as the reopening of the Burma Road. After Abe signed the document in Nanjing, the United States passed a huge loan of 100 million yuan to China, and there were rumors that Britain and the Soviet Union would follow suit and provide loans to China. These situations prove on the one hand that China is supported by many, and on the other hand, it is enough to expose Japan's miscalculations and failures, which have led to major setbacks.

For several years, Japan's foreign policy has always focused on relations with the United States, and it has relied on this for the life of the cabinet. The Japanese authorities know that its expansion attempts are most opposed by the United States, and that the United States' unparalleled economic power is the lifeline of Japan. Therefore, it has exhausted all its efforts to be humble and respectful to the United States over the years, hoping to reduce the pressure from the United States and obstruct the United States' aid to China, so as to realize its great desire to monopolize the Far East. On the American side, there was no intention or preparation for armed conflict with Japan. Moreover, some people are concerned about the commercial interests between the United States and Japan and are unwilling to let the relations between the two countries become too rigid. Therefore, although the White House authorities have a clear understanding and great ambition for the Far Eastern issue, they have always failed to be very active in its application. As a result, although Japan has repeatedly encountered setbacks in the United States, it has not completely abandoned its dream of easing relations with the United States. They do not understand that the United States at that time was still hoping that Japan would realize its mistakes, so it was unwilling to go too far. Who knew that Japan mistakenly believed that it could deceive the United States, so it arbitrarily damaged the rights and interests of the United States, and even promoted its so-called new order. When the European war suddenly changed and France was defeated, the Japanese authorities mistakenly believed that the British Empire was about to collapse, so it deeply colluded with Germany and Italy in order to scare off the United States and carry out the division of the world. It then used threats and friendly gestures alternately in order to complete its invasion of China and its southward advance while avoiding the heavy pressure from the United States. However, the recent international situation is no longer effective for those who intentionally deceive. For example, the fact that the United States' huge loan to China was established at the same time as the Abe document shows that the United States was already alert and prepared for countermeasures, and was not deceived or delayed by Japan's diplomatic offensive. In the past, China had high hopes for the United States but did not receive them. Now, Japan is recklessly promoting its realization. This is a major blow to Japan's diplomacy towards the United States and a fatal failure of the Konoe policy, but it is also something that Japan has brought upon itself.

This US loan to China is the fourth since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war. The previous $25 million tung oil loan in December 1938 and the $20 million tin ore loan in March of this year were both expressions of US support and friendship for China, but they were still commercial loans in nature and their uses were limited. The $25 million loan established in September to counter the Tripartite Pact was a direct loan to the Chinese government and was no longer restricted in its use, and gradually moved into the scope of political loans. As for the recently established US$100 million loan, its amount is greater than the sum of the previous three loans, and its political nature and significance are more obvious. In addition, it is considering providing China with military aircraft and other military supplies. This wise measure will increase China's courage and determination to resist the war, and its spiritual impact on China is as valuable as its actual effect. It is believed that these two great democratic countries on the east and west coasts of the Pacific will become more closely united in the future to achieve their common beliefs and goals. As for the Soviet Union and Britain, whether the rumors of loans are realized or not, under the current situation in the Far East, it is expected that they will be able to take similar or even parallel measures to the US government. If this cooperative relationship can continue to expand and deepen, then the precarious situation in the Far East will not be difficult to gradually stabilize in the future.

In recent days, Japanese rhetoric has been roaring again, and it has launched a major attack on the United States. Japan's attitude was repeatedly seen in September when the United States loaned money and imposed embargoes, and in early November when Roosevelt was elected for the third time. However, those opinions have not had any practical effect. The policy adopted by the Japanese government is not only not becoming tougher, but is responding with easing measures. Japan's current situation has not made progress due to its reckless actions, so the application of this policy towards the United States must not exceed the scope allowed by its strength. Now that Ambassador Nomura has not yet taken office in the United States, the Kokumin Shimbun, which represents the extreme faction, has asserted that he cannot improve the situation between the United States and Japan. However, apart from resorting to war, what other measures can be taken to deal with it? The Japanese authorities are probably very anxious about this, and it may even endanger the future of the Konoe cabinet. However, in today's Japan, it is impossible for the conservative forces to restore their original momentum in a short period of time, and the extreme elements' boastful words have no practical basis whatsoever. Therefore, under this new situation, where Japan is going is still a question to be decided.

### The National Government Rewards the Soldiers of Suiyuan; Fu Zuoyi Presents Medals on Behalf; The Ceremony of the Conferment Ceremony Was Grand

A dispatch from a certain place in Suiyuan: The medals, certificates, and rewards issued by the former National Government and the Electrical Commission to the heroic soldiers of the previous battle in Suiyuan have recently arrived in Suiyuan and were ordered to be presented on behalf of Deputy Commander-in-Chief Fu.

### Soviet Newspaper Comments on the Sino-Japanese War

Chongqing – A Moscow message: The Red Star newspaper published an article today reviewing the war situation in China. It stated that after the Chinese army launched a counteroffensive in Central China, the Japanese army had stopped advancing on all fronts. The Chinese army had advanced to Jingmingpu. The main reason for the Japanese army's failure was that the Chinese army had too many soldiers, resulting in a disparity in numbers. In mountainous areas, the Japanese army could not use its combat techniques, such as using tanks. In the Yangtze River area, the Chinese army was extremely active. Since the Chinese army laid mines on the Yangtze River, it has been very difficult for the Japanese army to transport troops and munitions to the front lines in Hubei by water. The newspaper paid great attention to the activities of the Chinese army in North China, especially in the northern half of the city, and stated that after the Japanese army withdrew from Guangxi, the Chinese army had occupied various places at the junction of Guangxi and Guizhou. The Chinese army's position in South China is extremely consolidated. (Dispatch from the 3rd)

### Chongqing Rice Prices Soar, Government Implements Price Controls

Chongqing: Recently, rice prices in Chongqing have nearly doubled. In August, the selling price was 30 yuan per *dou* (a unit of dry measure) (note: the *dou* used in Chongqing is larger and different from the one commonly used in Shanghai). Now, it has increased to 52 yuan. Although government agencies are selling broken rice to relieve the common people, the quantity is extremely small. Citizens are crowding to buy rice from various price-controlled entities. Based on the current situation, the amount spent on rice noodles by ordinary people each month is considerable. Therefore, the living conditions of general salaried workers, lower-level civil servants, and ordinary laborers are inevitably deeply strained.

In order to seek relief, the government authorities plan to procure rice and grains monthly to regulate the market. The National Food Administration has scheduled to implement price controls starting December 1st, for the general public, soldiers' families, students, and civil servants, etc., with a selling price of 60 yuan per *dan* (a unit of weight, about 50 kg), limited to 1,000 *dan* per day. However, it is found that the city's monthly rice demand is 250,000 *dan*. Therefore, the agency's daily price-controlled amount of 1,000 *dan* is obviously insufficient for distribution and must be increased accordingly.

In addition, the authorities are also taking various steps to facilitate grain merchants in purchasing rice from nearby districts and transporting it to Chongqing for sale. The current procedure for applying for rice transportation permits will naturally be abolished. From a general perspective, the price increases in Chongqing are not limited to rice and grains; all other daily necessities are also increasing. Economic experts have varied and inconclusive opinions on this price surge. Some attribute it to poor transportation, while others attribute it to currency inflation and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. However, the foreign exchange market in Chongqing and the exchange rate between Chongqing and Shanghai have recently become more stable than before, indicating that the argument that currency inflation is promoting price increases is clearly untenable.

An objective analysis of the recent price increase situation suggests that the real reason is the lack of inventory in the city treasury. For example, Sichuan province originally had an adequate supply of rice and grains, but now a large part has already been supplied for military use or hoarded by various banks and merchants, leading to a sense of supply falling short of demand. What is even more hateful is that those who hoard are blinded by greed, often reaping profits three to four times their investment, yet they are still not satisfied. Therefore, the rice price increase has no end. These people should be held accountable. (Havas News Agency, 4th)

### Greek Army Advances on All Fronts Through Snow, Significant Progress Made, Northern Route Only Thirty Miles from Argyrokastron, Southern Route Occupies Bremi Heights

Athens: Yesterday, Greek troops continued their fierce attacks on the Italian forces on all fronts, and have penetrated further into the eastern border of Albania. Correspondents from the Associated Press accompanying the leading Greek units reported that the main Greek forces are steadily advancing, undeterred by terrain obstacles such as mountains and wetlands, or climatic obstacles such as ice, snow, and cold. Greek forces are currently launching fierce attacks on the Italian forces entrenched in trenches on the shores and at the foot of the mountains near Lake Ohrid. According to the latest news received here, the Greek forces are only 400 yards away from the Italian forces. Wounded soldiers from both sides fighting fiercely in the wetlands are covered in mud. News from the captured cities of Ohrid and Struga in Yugoslavia also reported that Greek forces are clearing out the defeated Italian forces, and that the Greek forces in every area are advancing. Apart from an earlier report that the Italian forces had transferred reinforcements from their country to block the retreat of the Italian forces in Albania's Përmet region, no further news on this matter has been received since then. It is reported that the Greek forces' current progress in Albania has exceeded twice the area previously invaded by the Italian forces into Greek territory. (Associated Press, 4th)

Athens: Unofficial news came yesterday from the battle zone in Albania that the Greek forces on the southern front had won after a six-day battle with the Italian forces. They have now crossed the Thyrion, broken through the Italian defensive lines between Argyrokastron and Sarandë. It is claimed that another Greek detachment is advancing north along the coast towards Sarandë, so that this most important southern base of the Italian side has actually been isolated by the Greek forces. Although there is five feet of snow on the second line in the central district and on the front line in the far north, the Greek forces are also reported to be advancing. According to front-line reports, the Greek forces on the central and southern lines in the Pindus Mountains climbed barefoot the steep, cliff-like peaks of Mount Policia, which reach 7,500 feet, and then charged down at risk, directly attacking the Italian forces with bayonets. As a result, the Greek forces gained control of Bremi and are now planning to attack Tepelenë from there. (International News Service, 4th)

Athens: Semi-official sources claim that the Greek forces, advancing rapidly through the snow, have reached a point less than one and a quarter miles from Sarandë (the Italian side's main landing port in Albania). The Greek forces have also captured an important high ground controlling the city of Argyrokastron from the east. Both places are currently continuing to attack the Italian forces amidst heavy wind and snow. The snow is thickest on the northern front, where the Italian forces are retreating from Pogradec towards Elbasan, while the Greek forces are pursuing directly north along Lake Ohrid. Now that the fall of Sarandë is imminent, the Italian forces are suddenly expediting the continued northward movement of their supply lines. (Reuters, 4th)

London: The Greek forces have made new progress northeast of Argyrokastron, occupying a village and high ground overlooking Bremi. Bremi is a small town on the central front and is very important strategically. It is now believed that the Italian forces will be forced to abandon the town without a fight. (Reuters, 8th)

Budapest: According to news arriving here from the battle zone, the Greek forces, unexpectedly detouring through the high mountains in central Albania, reached a point thirty miles from the Albanian capital, Tirana, this morning. (International News Service, 4th)

Struga, Yugoslavia: According to reports received here, the Greek forces in the Konispol area advanced ten kilometers forward on Sunday and occupied the village of Markat. The Greek forces in the Gjirokastër area advanced nine miles on Sunday night and reached Mount Radonës. The Greek forces in the Moscopole area have also advanced ten kilometers in the past 24 hours, occupying the village of Kinikas on the river of Socha. Greek and Italian artillery are very active there. Another Greek force departed from Moscopole, crossed the wide river of Kalama, and advanced southwest. The Italian forces' attack on the village of Velezhda yesterday was repelled. (Associated Press, 4th)

Athens: It is reported that the Greek forces today occupied the last mountain pass between the Platorvouni Mountains and the Sarandë Mountains in northwestern Albania. Battle reports said that the Greek forces in the Bremi area occupied the perilous 4,000-foot high Mount Orgeni last night after a bloody battle. Greek forces in the northern district, in severe weather, drove out the enemy from the northwest fortress of Moscopole and captured strategically important positions. Sources in Athens said today that the Greek forces have captured a large number of prisoners in the northern district. Unofficial sources in Athens claim that the Greek forces heading towards Sarandë have broken through the Italian defensive lines between Argyrokastron and the Adriatic Sea. (Note: London's News Chronicle reported today that the Italian side has not been able to send a single troop ashore in Albania in the past eight days, and can only transport reinforcements by air, as the Greek side's bombing has rendered the main ports useless.) (International News Service, 4th)

London: Reuter's Athens correspondent recently stated that the left flank of the Greek forces, closely pursuing the retreating Italian forces, has now advanced to a key point only two miles from Sarandë, a major seaport in southwestern Albania. The correspondent also relayed authoritative news that the central wing of the Greek forces has occupied Mount Platorvouni. The Greek forces can launch further attacks from this mountain, or suppress the strong resistance of the Italian forces. In the eastern region, the Greek forces, after a fierce battle that caused heavy casualties to the Italian forces, advanced to a key point northeast of Libohovë. Near Bremi, the Greek forces captured 100 Italian soldiers. The Italian forces on Mount Quenia have been forced to withdraw from the mountain, as a force of Italian soldiers north of the mountain has been defeated. The right wing of the Greek forces, despite the severe weather, continues to attack relentlessly and has now advanced east of Moscopole, forcing the Italian forces to withdraw from this strategically important plateau. (Associated Press, 4th)

British Air Force Assists Greek Operations, Vlorë Port Heavily Attacked

London: In the past 24 hours, the port of Sarandë in Albania has felt the threat of the Greek forces even more intensely than before, so the retreat of the Italian forces in the Argyrokastron area is said to be even faster than their retreat from Korçë. British bombers are harassing the Italian rear. The Italian forces retreating from the Argyrokastron area will inevitably retreat to the port of Vlorë. The British Air Force, braving severe weather, heavily bombed the port of Vlorë. Although the Italian side had a large number of fighter planes patrolling, they were unable to prevent the British planes from bombing. A large building near the port of Vlorë was hit and caught fire, with continuous explosions like thunder. The British planes also dropped a batch of bombs on the main docks. One bomb hit a shipyard, and an Italian fighter plane was shot down. In the Argyrokastron area, British fighter planes also shot down an Italian reconnaissance plane. The squadron leader of the British planes that bombed Vlorë stated after returning to base that the mission was very successful. The British planes flew quite low due to cloud cover. Although the Italian fighter planes engaged, some British planes lured the enemy planes away, and the remaining planes took the opportunity to fly in and drop bombs. They saw warehouses being hit and exploding, with black smoke everywhere. The British planes dropped their bombs on target, and all planes returned safely. (Reuters, 4th)

Blackshirts Can't Endure Hardship, Stricken by Hunger and Cold, Many Die

London: It is heard that the number of Italian soldiers captured by the Greek forces in the recent Battle of Pogradec who are sick is increasing daily. The Italian soldiers are suffering greatly from the extreme cold and heavy snow. Most of the Italian soldiers cannot endure this hardship. According to news from the battle zone, the Greek forces, after winning, closely pursue the fleeing Italian forces, often leaving their camps amidst wind and snow before finishing their meals. The Italian forces wanted to bury landmines on their retreat route, but the Greek forces had already reached the mountain passes, so they fled in haste before they could bury them. The Greek forces were thus spared danger and continued to pursue and encircle several units of the Italian forces. Many Italian soldiers have died, causing the Greek commander-in-chief to have to designate several special areas to bury enemy corpses, lest they hinder the hygiene of the advancing Greek forces.

Italy Continues to Call Up Young Men, Turkey Watches Italo-Greek War Situation

London: It is heard that Italy is currently calling up 19-year-old young men to enlist in the army. Turkey is closely watching the Greek war of resistance. According to news from Ankara, it is said that their opinion is that the Greek forces' advance, especially those on the southern front, is making steady progress, without encountering any strong resistance. The Italian forces are currently in a very difficult situation. With the high ground controlling Argyrokastron occupied by the Greek forces, the fall of the city is imminent. (Reuters, 4th)

### Soviet Military Delegation Arrives in Bulgaria, Soviet-Bulgarian Relations Improve, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Clarifies Policy, Maintains Friendship with Neighboring Countries

Sofia: A Soviet military delegation arrived yesterday at the Bulgarian port of Burgas on the Black Sea coast. At the same time, Bulgarian officials announced that Soviet-Bulgarian relations have "further improved." Although the purpose of the delegation's visit was kept secret, political observers generally believe that the delegation's arrival is an indication of closer relations between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria. At the time of the delegation's arrival, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivan Popov was giving a speech in the National Assembly, subtly attacking Germany's pressure to include Bulgaria in the Axis powers. Popov said, "The main goal of the Bulgarian government is to avoid war, and the best way to maintain peace is to increase military preparedness and refuse to sign new international conventions. Our relations with the Soviet Union are improving." When mentioning the recent friction over the Macedonian issue, Popov said, "Bulgaria intends to work hard to contact Yugoslavia, so as to meet our goal of permanent friendship." When mentioning Turkish-Bulgarian relations, Popov only said, "Our relations with Turkey are also quite friendly." According to news from Ankara, Turkey has decided to double its annual military spending, bringing the total to 26,000,000 yuan. (International News Service, 8th)

Sofia: Rumors here about the resignation of Foreign Minister Popov were rampant yesterday. There was also talk that Defense Minister Dascalov was preparing to submit his resignation, but as of the time of dispatch, it had not been officially confirmed. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

London: According to news received here from the Romanian border, 60,000 or 70,000 German troops have already arrived in Romania. The Daily Telegraph reports that Hungarian newspapers have reported that Germany has sent a large army to eliminate the terrorist activities of the Iron Guard. It also said that four German divisions have crossed Hungary. At the same time, according to news arriving here, the official spokesperson of the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin refused to comment on Germany's "dispatch of troops to Romania due to military relations." (International News Service, 4th)

Vichy: According to a dispatch from the Romanian capital, the Iron Guard is now being disarmed. The government has ordered Iron Guard members and other Romanian people to hand over weapons and ammunition within three days, or face five years of hard labor and confiscation of property.

### Birmingham, the Industrial Center of London, Suffers Another Air Raid, British Planes Attack German Naval Bases at Night, Naples Port in Italy Hit and Catches Fire

London: Yesterday evening, a swarm of German planes flew to East Anglia and southwestern England, with about a dozen planes dropping bombs on the outskirts of London. It was also heard that bombs fell in Sussex and East Anglia, but the losses and casualties were minimal. Last night's alarm in London was the earliest in recent days, starting at 4:30 PM (London time). (Associated Press, 4th)

A City in West Midland: Last night, a swarm of German planes launched a fierce attack on this city, continuing to wreak havoc for four hours from dusk, with only a 25-minute pause in between. The German planes first dropped a number of incendiary bombs here, and then several squadrons of bombers flew in, following their usual tactics, dropping a large number of high-explosive bombs and time bombs. Before dropping the high-explosive bombs, the German planes first dropped flares, and also dropped incendiary bombs to create light to illuminate the targets. However, the fires caused by the incendiary bombs were quickly extinguished. (Reporters say that this city is clearly Birmingham, as German sources in Berlin had said that Birmingham was the main target of the German planes last night. This city had previously suffered two fierce bombings. The heavily damaged areas include six locations. However, it is heard that the casualties were very few. The first air raid last night lasted 90 minutes. After a short pause after the first bombing, the second bombing started again, with the German planes repeating the fierce tactics of the previous time, bombing the city for two and a half hours without stopping. Two schools, two furniture warehouses, and many residences were the targets of the German planes. The bombed residences have been razed to the ground. A strongly built basement was also hit by a bomb. Nineteen civilians were living in the basement, but only one was killed. The rest fled in a panic in the midst of the crisis. (Associated Press, 4th)

London: According to the British Air Ministry, London and the Midlands were again the targets of German bombing last night, but after 10:00 PM, the raiders left, and the British skies were then clear of German planes. Yesterday's air raid in England, although quite active, was not very large in scale. Last night's Nazi attack seemed to be a complete failure, as only a few places caught fire in the Midlands area, and the fires were soon brought under control. No major fires were reported in the London area either, and no important facilities were damaged in London's capital area. Some bombs also fell in the area between London and the Midlands coast, but the casualties were minimal. Only three places caught fire in the London area, and they were immediately extinguished. Two cinemas in London were hit by several incendiary bombs, and the bombs exploded in the crowd of spectators. However, the spectators calmly left the cinemas and walked to the streets without panic. A monastery recently converted into a public shelter was also hit by a high-explosive bomb yesterday, killing several people. Several high-explosive bombs also fell on the outskirts of London. Several high-explosive bombs also fell in front of a hospital in an outlying area. The walls and water pipes of the hospital were destroyed by the explosions, and a large fire broke out, with flames lasting half an hour. However, there were no casualties in the hospital and nearby houses. Two bombs fell in another area, damaging several buildings and causing several casualties. (Associated Press, 4th)

London: Last night, the British Air Force's bombing of the German naval bases was quite successful. The German submarine base of Lorient in the Bay of Biscay was heavily attacked by British planes, with large and small bombs raining down. A German ship off the coast of Norway was hit, and a supply ship also had its stern hit. The British planes all returned safely afterwards. Last night, long-range bombers of the British Air Force in the Near East flew over the Mediterranean Sea and dropped bombs on the port of Naples in Italy, hitting railway junctions and oil refineries. A large fire suddenly broke out, illuminating the area 20 miles away. The main tracks were also bombed. At the same time, the Catania airfield was also attacked. Incendiary bombs were dropped and fires broke out in several places. One enemy plane on the ground was completely destroyed. The Augusta airfield was also hit and caught fire. (Reuters, 4th)

### German Air Force Hero Wick Dies

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military bulletin claimed that a German submarine had once again achieved a great feat, sinking as many as six enemy merchant ships (31,500 tons) with armed escorts with one submarine. This is truly rare. The night before, German planes bombed the harbor of Bristol, and although the weather was bad, the bombs were quite accurate. Southampton and London were both bombed. Several planes parked in the airfield of Sheringham were destroyed by explosions. Ordnance factories, barracks, and transportation equipment were hit. Last night, German planes bombed central and southern England. British planes attacked central and southwestern Germany, causing minimal losses. Major Wick, who had achieved the special achievement of shooting down 56 enemy planes, is unfortunately missing and is feared to have died for his country. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### Germany Will Launch New Submarine Tactics Against Britain, Germany Claims to Have Sunk a Total of Twenty British Ships in One Day, Totaling 160,000 Tons

Berlin: Neutral sources say that Germany will use at least 100 submarines, divided into several large groups, as the mainstay of its winter war against Britain. In the past, German submarines lurked alone in various seas, but now they will change to new tactics, deploying entire teams in key locations to search for convoys, replacing the previous single submarines. This statement has been officially confirmed. (Associated Press, 4th)

Berlin: Well-informed sources in Germany claim that German submarines sank 165,000 tons of British ships on Sunday. Another two ships, totaling 16,000 tons, were also mostly sunk. Of the 165,000 tons, 110,000 tons belonged to an entire convoy. In this attack, Captain Mengersen's submarine sank 41,000 tons. Another submarine sank two ships totaling 21,000 tons, one of which was the "Victoria" ship. (Associated Press, 4th)

Berlin: This morning, German newspapers published on their front pages the great achievement of German submarines sinking 20 enemy ships in one day, totaling 160,000 tons. According to the Berlin Morning Post, 160,000 tons in wartime is equivalent to 230,000 tons, which is the equivalent of 11,500 modern railway freight cars, with each car carrying a load of 20 tons. The loss of such a large amount of goods is particularly serious during wartime. Britain suffers the loss of shipwrecks day and night, and as the days and months accumulate, Britain's situation will become unbearable. There will be less and less external supply, and the scope of destroyed factories will become wider and wider. Eventually, an Englishman will suffer the pain of starvation.

### The Pope Appeals to the Warring Nations to Temporarily Cease Hostilities on Christmas, Berlin Expresses Its Attitude

Vatican City: Authorities in the Diocese indicated today that Pope Pius XII is currently using diplomatic means to appeal to the warring nations to cease fire on Christmas Day. It is believed that the Pope will use diplomatic pressure to achieve his goal. Although Germany and Britain have already stated that they cannot accept this truce, the Pope has still issued a declaration, urging all nations to at least temporarily cease hostilities on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. (International News Service, 4th)

Vatican City: Since the Catholic bishops of the warring nations asked the Pope how to hold this year's Christmas Eve Mass, the Pope immediately instructed the bishops to move the Mass to the afternoon so as not to violate the lighting control regulations. At the same time, the Pope expressed his hope for peace in his instructions. (Associated Press, 4th)

Berlin: When foreign reporters here inquired about the proposal for a ceasefire during the Christmas season, German authorities replied that Berlin had not heard anything about it, and that British Prime Minister Churchill had already declared that Britain would never consider the proposal for a ceasefire. Therefore, discussing this matter again under such circumstances would be fruitless. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Painful History of the European War (4)

### The Inside Story of Daladier and Reynaud: A Nation Misled by Romance

This chapter is another excerpt from "The Tragedy of France," a new work by French historian André Maurois, translated below:

Throughout history, partisanship and infighting among authorities have frequently impacted battles and hindered national governance. In 1918, France was fortunate to have a strong and capable leader who suppressed disruptive elements. This man was Georges Clemenceau, known as the "Tiger Premier." However, France in 1939 was different. While Daladier and Reynaud, the men in power, were undoubtedly loyal, they were fundamentally incompatible. Throughout the war, they continued to plant parties and fight for power, causing conflict without end. France's misfortune was, in large part, due to their irreconcilable feud.

On the day of King George VI's coronation at Westminster Abbey, I was also in attendance. As Reynaud entered, a British officer sitting next to me suddenly asked, "Who is that short man with the Japanese face?"

I replied, "Don't let his small stature fool you; he is the future Prime Minister of France."

Mrs. Reynaud, Christiane Henriette Robutel, was the beloved daughter of a famous lawyer and a close friend of my wife. Because of this connection, I paid particular attention to Reynaud's career. He was intelligent and courageous, a rare quality among politicians. During the sterling depreciation, Reynaud was the only one who dared to advocate for the devaluation of the French franc. Later, when forced by the situation, the devaluation of the franc was ultimately unavoidable. Colonel de Gaulle advocated for the mechanization of the army and the formation of powerful armored divisions, and Reynaud was among the few French officials who paid attention to and studied his ideas. France generally allowed its youth to drift, but Reynaud wrote a pamphlet titled "France as Expected by the Youth," a loud call to awaken the nation.

Before the war, France faced a financial crisis, and Reynaud took office as Minister of Finance. Within weeks of his appointment, the national treasury had increased by billions of francs in gold. He would occasionally be struck by an idea, suddenly leap up, put his hands in his pockets, stick out his chest, raise his head, and speak with a hammering voice, full of power, which I found particularly captivating. We often jokingly called him "Little Rooster," hoping he would fight for justice.

However, despite his intelligence, he was competitive and overly confident, which made him arrogant. While his arguments were often brilliant, his language could be sharp. When discussing financial and economic issues with outsiders, he had an air of self-importance, which naturally aroused resentment among politicians. Daladier, in particular, could not stand him.

Daladier was as eloquent as Reynaud, but his manner of speaking was not as boastful or overbearing. He was sincere and his words were moving, suggesting a heart full of worries. Whenever Daladier gave public speeches about the war, regardless of whether the audience was farmers, merchants, or industrialists, they all regarded him as a mentor to the French people due to his friendly tone, dignified voice, and sincere love of peace.

Daladier had been a history professor, and his original sincerity, combined with his historical background, further fueled his enthusiasm to serve the country. However, his many virtues were offset by two major flaws. First, he was impatient and suspicious, distrusting his colleagues. Second, he was indecisive, sometimes holding no opinion at all. He would occasionally fly into a rage, pounding the table with his fist, but despite the fierce expression, his colleagues said he was nothing more than an "empty fist" and that he was like "a pair of tender hands inside an iron glove," strong on the outside but weak on the inside. However, the public only saw his outwardly motivated and capable appearance and did not know his true character. Therefore, they gave him the nickname "Little Bull of Camargue," hoping he would take decisive and surprising action.

One day, I asked Reynaud, "If Daladier were to leave office, who would be your ideal successor?"

He replied, "In the minds of the French people, it would still be Daladier."

Daladier's impetuousness, irritability, and suspicious nature led him to quarrel with Édouard Herriot, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. They both belonged to the Radical Socialist Party, both named Édouard, but they were like fire and water, tearing the Radical Party apart. A play by Bette described a character who was suspicious and indecisive, even hesitant to go to church as the groom on his wedding day. Reynaud often said that Daladier was that kind of person. He originally promoted radicalism, but later organized the Popular Front, which was hoped for by the conservative middle class, precisely because of his changeable nature! Daladier would often retort, "When Reynaud speaks, he is always smug and self-satisfied, making it unbearable. I think he is like a peacock spreading its tail, strutting around and showing off."

At that time, France was engaged in a battle for survival, and the two men, burdened with the important task of leading the nation, should have worked together to overcome the difficulties. However, they each clung to their own opinions and were unable to reach an agreement. They were also poisoned by the gossiping whispers of women, which naturally led to resentment and hatred.

At first glance, this matter may seem insignificant and unrelated to the great tragedy of France, so why mention it? However, on the one hand, all the main facts are already known to the world, and on the other hand, the private lives of some French politicians undeniably hindered their public duties, so it cannot be ignored.

It would be a mistake to say that the French nation was corrupt in 1939. Countless good people were living their simple and peaceful lives. However, in Paris, there were more than three thousand people who were different from the rest. They were like the poets Byron described, "Because they slept well, they thought they were the leaders of the world." They indulged in pleasure without regard, unaware that these romantic entanglements would bring disaster to the country. Therefore, to be a leader of a nation, one must first be able to control one's desires.

After Daladier's marriage ended, he became entangled with the Marquise de Crussol. The Marquise was beautiful, elegant, and had skin as white as snow and a face that could captivate a city. Although she liked power and loved politics and economics, she stayed behind the scenes and did not want to elevate her lover or flaunt him to the world. Because she adhered to her role, she did not cause much harm to the country.

However, Countess Hélène de Portes, Reynaud's mistress, was somewhat restless, meddlesome, and truly a dangerous figure, as will be seen later.

One day, in front of Reynaud, I criticized a questionable appointment made by Daladier.

Reynaud said that it was not Daladier's intention, but "hers."

I said, "There is no excuse for that."

Reynaud sighed and said, "You don't know how much a busy man needs sweetness at night!"

When the war broke out, she—Reynaud's mistress—became ambitious, not satisfied with Reynaud being Minister of Finance. She disregarded everything and pushed him to the position of Prime Minister. She spread rumors everywhere that Daladier lacked perseverance and had no achievements, saying that Reynaud's succession as Prime Minister was imminent. These rumors would naturally reach Daladier's ears, which deepened his hatred for Reynaud. The two men were members of the wartime cabinet and, for a time, did not even speak to each other. This was truly an absurd situation, and the overall situation of the country was therefore unimaginable.

On March 19, Daladier's cabinet was on the verge of collapse. The failure of the Finnish war caused anger in the parliament, accusing Daladier of failing to provide timely assistance. This criticism may not have been fair, because it was truly difficult to form an expeditionary force and send it to Finland. Even if it had been sent, it might have ended in utter defeat.

However, the parliamentarians ignored these considerations. They requested a closed-door meeting, which lasted all afternoon without a result. The meeting continued at ten o'clock that night.

Reynaud came to my house at eight o'clock for dinner. He said to us, "That unlucky Daladier is really suffering today. I wouldn't be surprised if his cabinet falls tonight."

My wife interjected, "Who would be the next Prime Minister?"

Reynaud replied, "That depends on the President's intentions and the factors that led to Daladier's downfall." (To be continued)

Knowledge for Married Couples

### The Reasons and Treatment for Kidney Deficiency in Men After Marriage

—Co-authored by Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor, and Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road (Hours) 10 AM to 6 PM, Closed on Sundays

Kidney deficiency is the destroyer of love between couples and shortens lifespan.

If a man develops kidney deficiency after marriage, the love between the couple will inevitably be affected. This is because marriage is a union based on sexual relations. A man with abundant energy and a beautiful and graceful woman will undoubtedly lead a sweet life. Therefore, the couple's love is strong, they bear clever and healthy children, and they form a happy and fulfilling family. How wonderful is that! But if a man has kidney deficiency and a lack of energy, the couple's life cannot be complete, and their love will inevitably be damaged. In recent newspapers and magazines, or in casual conversations, we often hear or see cases of marital disputes or divorces in court, where the wife speaks eloquently about how the husband is unable to perform his marital duties, and she is wasting her youth, unable to make sacrifices. In addition, if a husband's kidney deficiency is left untreated, his body will gradually weaken, and he may die from illness, leaving behind orphans and a widow. According to statistics and research on the deaths of young husbands by a certain doctor, there are alarming numbers! Therefore, kidney deficiency in men after marriage is a serious problem that should be given attention by doctors today.

Why do so many men have kidney deficiency after marriage? The main reason is that men often masturbate or experience nocturnal emissions during their spring awakening, or because of marital debauchery and indulgence. Overuse of the brain, or damage from work, congenital weakness, or imbalances after illness are also occasional causes. In mild cases, there are often no obvious symptoms on the outside. As the condition progresses, it is often accompanied by neurasthenia and decreased metabolic function. Therefore, symptoms such as headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, back pain, seminal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, sallow complexion, thin muscles, fear of cold, aversion to heat, and mental fatigue will follow one another, leaving the person struggling in depression and fatigue all day long. The pain of life is difficult to describe!

According to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, the most effective and specific treatment for this condition is the "Testosterone" preparation, which is a reproductive hormone preparation. This preparation is based on actual needs, and countless world medical experts have devoted their life's experience to researching and experimenting with each other. It is made by extracting reproductive hormones from strong animals such as apes and chimpanzees, resulting in the effects of curing diseases, prolonging life, and rejuvenating. This has shocked the modern world medical community. Dr. Steinach, a leading European physiologist, has made the greatest contribution to the invention of this preparation, so the preparation is named "Steinach's Testosterone." This drug is pure in quality and acts through the principle of replenishing. After taking it, it can produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, nourish nerves, and promote metabolism within a day and night, without stimulating the yang, invigorating the stomach, exciting the nerves, or causing other side effects. If you continue to take it, you will be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and it can prolong life. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Himeito's Jing Solidifying Pills" to strengthen the seminal gate and stop leakage, which will make the effect faster. If patients can come to our clinic for expert diagnosis and receive scientific treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

### The Sorrow and Salvation of Untreated Seminal Emission

—Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Without a doubt, the most common problem that every man faces during adolescence is masturbation. Although this habit seems simple and contemptible, once a young person engages in it, it can easily become a habit. Once the habit is formed, it is like being addicted to smoking. Although one knows the harm, one cannot completely quit. Because one cannot completely quit, the reproductive glands are the first to be damaged, the seminal gate relaxes, and the ensuing result is seminal emission.

From a health perspective, seminal emission is the most harmful to the brain, sexual organs, and spinal cord nerves. Therefore, once a young person suffers from this evil disease, their thinking ability will decline rapidly. At the same time, memory loss, back pain, tinnitus, heart palpitations, and night sweats will occur. What is even more frightening is that the youth-producing function is severely affected, and the sexual organs become as small as a child's. Moreover, because the seminal gate opens and closes too frequently, the muscles around the seminal vesicle relax, leading to sudden spermatorrhea and leakage, which can cause impotence and premature ejaculation. This kind of young person not only suffers severe blows to their own health and great future but also often causes their wife to hate them because they cannot fulfill their responsibilities in their marital life! As a result, they feel guilty inside, are restrained by their wives outside, and feel ashamed and resentful! Their pain is almost indescribable!

Regarding the method of rescuing this condition, first, the patient must clear their mind of desires, avoid bad contacts, exercise diligently, and quit bad habits. Every night before going to bed, wash the area with cold water, pay attention to urination, and take four "Himeito's Jing Solidifying Pills" to strengthen the seminal gate. Then seminal emission can be stopped on the same night. If, due to frequent sperm leakage, there are various symptoms of weakness as mentioned above, then the reproductive hormone preparation "Testosterone" should also be taken. This preparation is extracted from the reproductive glands of lions, tigers, chimpanzees, sea dogs, etc., and is mixed with precious minerals and plant substances, and is scientifically produced. Therefore, within a day and night of taking it, it can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and benefit the marrow. If you continue to take it and persevere, then even an extremely weak body and extremely vicious seminal emission and spermatorrhea can be completely cured in a short period of time.

Beauty

### How to Achieve Healthy and Beautiful Breasts

—American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Healthy and beautiful breasts are a necessary condition for modern women

A pair of towering breasts on a woman's chest certainly helps to enhance her beauty, ensure her ability to have children, and facilitate the convenience of breastfeeding. Therefore, promoting breast development is of utmost value. The wheels of time are moving forward, and the development of women's breasts is an example of the progress of the times. We should unanimously agree with and strive to assist them in their success! However, with deeply rooted habits, most of the women we see have flat breasts and thin faces, showing signs of premature aging. Therefore, for women with some new knowledge, how to make their breasts healthy and beautiful has indeed become a common and important issue. In our medical judgment, the special development of breasts is a characteristic of female physiology. The development of this physiological characteristic is based on the function of the woman's ovaries. If the ovarian function is sound, then not only will the breasts naturally rise, but the hips will also develop, the voice will be like a warbling bird, and the temperament will be gentle and affectionate. At the same time, the metabolic function will be vigorous, and the skin, muscles, blood, and other parts will be filled with new cells. Therefore, the skin is white and tender, the muscles are plump, and the blood is full and bright red, which makes the face flushed like a peach blossom. Without the need for makeup, she is already extremely beautiful. Although age increases, she can maintain her youth. Marital life is bound to be very sweet, and she will bear clever and healthy children, forming a happy and fulfilling family. What a happy woman! However, women who have had their chests bound in the past, or who have hidden ailments such as leukorrhea, a lack of sensation, or irregular menstruation, will inevitably have their ovarian function damaged, resulting in flat breasts and a fading face. There is no hope for fertility, and the love between husband and wife is weak. Her fate must be extremely miserable! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Testosterone" for women to nourish the ovarian function and invigorate the metabolism. Then the breasts can be raised within ten days, and the above-mentioned hidden ailments can be eliminated at once. It is truly a good gynecological medicine for promoting beauty and eliminating diseases.

### Tensions Subside on Thai-Vietnamese Border; Officials Hope for Successful Negotiations; Thai Artillery Fires on French Armored Transport Ship

Hanoi: Yesterday, there were no major battles on the Thai-Vietnamese border. Officials hope that the negotiations by French Minister to Bangkok, Mr. Garreau, will succeed before the dry season arrives, as the dry season would provide an opportunity for large-scale battles. Although the border situation is serious, French officials are still making sarcastic remarks, saying, "Will Vietnam attempt to invade with armored elephant brigades?" According to French sources, the Siamese fired machine guns at the town of Dak To (phonetic translation) on Sunday night and dropped leaflets along the Mekong River. Fighting has occurred intermittently along the Thai-Vietnamese border from Vientiane, the capital of Laos, to the Gulf of Siam, but these have been minor skirmishes. French officials do not believe Bangkok's claims that a French warship was sunk in the Mekong River. The French side claims that the activities of native "Fifth Columns" in the Binh Dinh province are forcing French authorities to make efforts to suppress native rebellions. A Thai pilot and a Thai reconnaissance officer were reportedly captured after mistakenly landing at the Cambodian airfield of Loviéa on the Thai border. (United Press, 4th)

Saigon: According to an official announcement, a Thai military aircraft invaded French Vietnamese airspace this afternoon and was forced to land in the Bansi Sisa Phon district of Cambodia. The pilot was not injured and has been detained by Vietnamese authorities. (Havas, 3rd)

Kunming: It is reported that some French nationals in Yunnan Province, including some men, have been ordered by the French government to serve in the military to resist the Thai invasion of Vietnam. Many of these French nationals will be leaving Yunnan soon. (United Press, 4th)

Vichy: Regarding the border dispute between Vietnam and Thailand, authorities here announced yesterday that a foreign news agency had issued a report stating that fighting had occurred on the Thai-Vietnamese border and that Thai forces had occupied three locations within Vietnamese territory. This report is purely fabricated and has no basis in reality. Since November 27th, the Thais have caused various incidents in Vietnam, and on November 27th and 29th, and December 1st and 2nd, they bombed the Vietnamese villages of Thakhek and Savannakhet four times. Vietnamese authorities have taken all necessary measures on the border to maintain order. (Havas, 4th)

London: According to an official statement released in Bangkok, a warship carrying French troops invaded Thai territory, and border troops intercepted them. Thai aircraft also attacked the warship, hitting it with three rounds. The French troops were driven out of Thai territory, and the warship has returned. Another report states that the landed French troops were repelled on the northeast bank of the Mekong River, suffering heavy casualties. French sources say that several villages on the French border have been destroyed by machine gun fire. There may still be hope for a peaceful resolution of the current dispute between Thailand and Vietnam. The Thai Supreme Command has issued a warning, demanding that the French immediately cease their border incursions, or they will face a fierce retaliation. (Reuters, 4th)

Chongqing: The Central Daily News reported that the outbreak of war between Vietnam and Thailand may indicate Japan's determination to proceed with its southern strategy. It is noteworthy that Thailand resorted to force only after negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia were suspended. Japan is currently using Thailand to fulfill its desire to completely occupy Vietnam as a base for its southward expansion. At the same time, if the Dutch East Indies refuses to comply, Japan will take military action against them. It is reported that as a result of negotiations between Vichy and Tokyo, Japan obtained the French government's consent to establish an air base in Saigon. The newspaper believes that the conflict between Vietnam and Thailand is closely related to the situation in the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters, 4th)

Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, French authorities in Hanoi announced today that all telegraph and telephone communications between Thailand and Vietnam have been interrupted, except for those via Singapore. (Reuters, 4th)

Hanoi: Mr. Hermann, a Dutch journalist for the Handelsblad newspaper of the Dutch East Indies, was shot and killed by a Thai soldier last night. Mr. Hermann was sitting in a guardhouse at the border town of Poipet (phonetic translation) at 6:30 PM when he was hit by a bullet. It is believed that the bullet was fired by a Thai soldier who had entered Vietnam. (United Press, 4th)

Hanoi: The government here, in an effort to promote a peaceful resolution to the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, has now agreed to postpone the implementation of retaliatory measures. It also stated that the border was very quiet last night. (United Press, 4th)

Vichy: An official statement here said that Thai aircraft had repeatedly bombed Thakhek and Savannakhet in the previous four days, causing heavy casualties. The statement denied reports that Thai forces had occupied Aranyaprathet, that French aircraft had bombed Thai territory, and that French aircraft had been shot down. The statement said that the Thai army has 100,000 men, including 22 infantry divisions, four cavalry divisions, 80 tanks, and several American aircraft. It also estimated that the Thai navy is stronger than the French Far East Fleet. (United Press, 4th)

Bangkok: The Thai Supreme Command stated that on Monday, Thai anti-aircraft artillery fired on a French armored transport ship on the Mekong River, scoring multiple hits. The ship was attempting to land soldiers on the Thai bank of the Mekong River. It also stated that French long-range artillery had shelled the Thai bank of the Mekong River. A police station and a tower near the northern Thai border city of Tha Pa Klang (phonetic translation) were hit. Thai artillery returned fire, and Thai aircraft strafed the French long-range artillery with machine guns. There were no Thai casualties, and French casualties are unknown. Radio Saigon also broadcast a message in Thai yesterday, warning Vietnam not to send troops to the border to confront Thai actions. (United Press, 4th)

### Regarding the Wang Jingwei-Japan Treaty: A Glimpse of British Newspaper Commentary - It Cannot Influence the Situation in the Far East, Nor Can It Change the Policies of the Powers

London: Various newspapers here have commented on the signing of the Wang-Japan treaty. The London Times published an analysis on Monday, examining the wording and implied conditions of the Wang-Japan treaty. It concluded that Japan's recognition of the "Wang organization" cannot influence the situation in the Far East, nor can it affect the established policies and attitudes of the powers. The Axis countries are naturally cheering and praising it, and the Vichy government has no choice but to tacitly acknowledge it. However, at this moment, the United States is providing China with another $50 million in aid. The British policy remains steadfast, and the Soviet Union maintains its freedom of action. Japan's recognition of Wang Jingwei cannot depress the Chinese government because of the recent large-scale withdrawal of Japanese troops from South China and the failure of the Japanese army to maintain order in North and Central China. The Chinese government will not become more worried because of the Wang-Japan treaty. Japan's recognition of the "Wang organization" does not reduce Japan's military responsibilities. Japan still needs to conscript hundreds of thousands of soldiers every year to protect the survival of its regime. The newspaper also prominently published a dispatch from Washington stating that the United States should announce a loan at this time, which would be the first major diplomatic action since President Roosevelt's election and would be of great significance to the Japanese government and its new ambassador, Nomura. Nomura's appointment as the new ambassador clearly aims to improve Japanese-American relations. Tokyo's attempt to get the United States to accept the fait accompli as a basis for negotiations has never come close to realization since the United States abolished the commercial treaty. Secretary of State Hull's statement on the 30th of last month that the Chongqing government has the support of the vast majority of the Chinese people is indeed true. The newspaper's Tokyo dispatch analyzes the nature of the Wang-Japan "treaty." Between the lines, it specifically clarifies that this document cannot change the current state of the war, stating that as long as the Chinese government continues to fight, Japan will never achieve the objective conditions it requires. A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry explicitly stated that this condition will only be achieved when Japan acknowledges that anti-Japanese sentiment has been eradicated. In addition, the News Chronicle's brief and clear editorial stated that the Wang-Japan "treaty" has suffered two major blows. If Japan still hopes that China will stop the war, admit defeat, and accept the "new order," then this hope has quickly become a pipe dream. The United States' loan to China shows the United States' determination to prevent Japan from realizing its ambitions in the Far East. China continues to fight, holding a crucial front line on the world's battlefield. The Manchester Guardian also has a penetrating editorial discussing this matter, stating that "'Good Neighborliness and Economic Cooperation' means that China accepts Japan's political and economic sanctions. Japan's stationing of troops in China under the pretext of anti-communism is extremely important. Japan is trying to expel the rights and interests of various countries in China. If China does not submit, Japan cannot advance south. If Japan withdraws from China without suffering damage, it can turn to advance south. After advancing south, it will advance north again."

### Food Prices in Peiping Triple

Peiping: Since the assassination of a Japanese lieutenant colonel here on November 29th, food prices in Peiping have tripled because the Japanese closed the city gates to search for the assassins. The Japanese are still conducting searches, but so far have found nothing. (4th United Press dispatch)

### Greek Cargo Ship Sends SOS Signal

Hong Kong: The tugboat "Henry Keswick" is currently en route to assist the cargo ship "Greek Merchant," which was en route from Hong Kong to Hongji, Vietnam, on Sunday. The radio station received a distress signal from this cargo ship last night, stating that it had run aground and was damaged north of Hainan Island at 20.14 degrees north latitude and 110.58 degrees east longitude, and urgently needed rescue. Although the radio company stated that the signal received was sent by a British cargo ship, it is generally believed that it must be the cargo ship "Greek Merchant," owned by the Greek Yannoulatos, with a registered tonnage of 1,052 tons.

### Yunnan Education Announces Recent Status of Education Throughout the Province (Part 2)

Elementary Education

The goal of elementary education is to implement the basic national education, that is, compulsory education and preparatory education for further education. The facilities for elementary education in this province, the important statistics of elementary education in the province last year, (1) Number of schools: 15,579, including 56 kindergartens, 12,618 four-year primary schools, 422 six-year complete primary schools, 102 three-year simple primary schools, and 2,382 one-year short-term primary schools. (2) Number of classes: 25,339. (3) Children: 774,816, including 621,815 boys and 53,001 girls (accounting for one-quarter of the total). (4) Number of faculty and staff: 29,734 (including 27,425 men and 2,309 women). (5) Expenditure: 3,271,918 yuan, calculated as 4.02 yuan per child per year for education, an average of 26 students per teacher, and an average salary of 104.52 yuan for each primary school teacher, with an average income of 8.71 yuan. Rural primary schools still have some support in terms of firewood and rice, but the treatment of primary school teachers is indeed too meager. Beginning this year, the Department promulgated the compulsory education plan for the entire province. The main point is to promote compulsory education on the one hand and improve elementary education on the other. The main methods are: the units implementing compulsory education, the establishment of short-term primary schools in villages and towns, four-year primary schools, and then the establishment of six-year complete primary schools in districts, with special attention to the establishment of senior departments. Furthermore, county towns should establish large-scale, high-quality six-year complete primary schools, purely for the purpose of preparing for further education, and kindergartens should be established simultaneously, with the principle of being able to separate boys' and girls' schools. The number of school-age children in the province is 1,645,985, accounting for more than one-seventh of the province's population of 11,954,802. The number of students currently enrolled is 774,816, accounting for more than 45 percent of school-age children, which is less than half of the number who should be enrolled. In recent years, short-term primary schools that do not cost manpower or financial resources have been promoted as much as possible, and the Provincial Department has established experimental short-term schools in various counties. The intention is to quickly complete the national coverage of popular education. The national completion of popular education is only six years, so we must catch up quickly. The counties and districts along the northwestern, southwestern, and southern borders of this province are the distribution areas of Tusi Yi people. Because their language, customs, and habits are very different from those in the interior, the local educational and cultural standards are far behind those in the interior. Previously, the Education Department held border education in border counties, establishing one provincial primary school in each county. There are currently 34 border provincial primary schools, with 154 classes and 7,930 students, of which Yi students account for four-tenths.

Social Education

The facilities and methods of social education and people's education can be broadly divided into two types: social type and school type. Social-type undertakings include 5 provincial-level people's education centers, 51 county-level people's education centers, 1 provincial-level library, more than 10 county-level libraries, 2 provincial-level public sports fields, 36 sudden-establishment sports fields, 5 provincial-level film and broadcasting patrol education teams, and 2 provincial-level drama, music, and song patrol education teams. School-type undertakings mainly focus on adult education that popularizes literacy training to eliminate illiteracy and popularizes civic training to cultivate citizens. Its facilities can be further divided into peacetime people's education and wartime people's education. Wartime people's education is promoted in Kunming City and County, with significant results. It is estimated that by the end of this year, 70,000 illiterate people can be eliminated, with an average education cost of 1.60 yuan per person. It is now planned to designate 29 counties, including Chenggong, to implement wartime people's education, with a time limit of one year to eliminate illiteracy for 1 million people in three years, and 3 million people. All are young and strong backbones of the province aged 17 to 35. If it can be done, the impact will be significant. (The End)

### Food: Speculative Rice Merchants Get Their Wish - Kunshan Japonica Rice at 106 Yuan - More Than 10,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive at the Source - Yesterday's Selling Price Saw a Slight Rebound in the Afternoon

After the rice market experienced consecutive days of skyrocketing prices, the Rice Industry Association announced that from today onwards, all market purchases must be based on the morning market price on the 3rd and must not be exceeded. If there are any violations of private secret transactions, once verified, they will be reported to the authorities for strict punishment. The rice market yesterday did not open until nearly noon. Most speculative large households were still watching and not thinking of selling. Only some small scattered households, due to tight funds and inability to hold on, slightly released their holdings. However, the buying households were indifferent in this situation. With the sales market cleared, the sellers had to lower their prices to solicit buyers. In addition, because new transactions continued to be officially announced and there were direct orders, most speculators became timid and sought to sell. Therefore, the market weakened in the middle of the day, and the market rebounded by two or three yuan in the afternoon. After the sellers became more active in the afternoon, Chinese and foreign merchants contacted them by telegram. The floating households made a lot of profits and cut their positions, and the market rebounded by one yuan. As a result, the spot price rebounded by two or three yuan, and the futures price rebounded by three or four yuan. In addition to the 1,500 tons of small twisted rice from Taihe Foreign Bank in January at a price of 78 yuan, other new transactions have not been announced. The returned goods included Saigon spot goods opened at 105 yuan, December at 96.5 yuan to 95 yuan, No. 2 at 96 yuan to 95.5 yuan, and small twisted rice at 86 or 7 yuan. The holders competed to sell, so the returned transactions increased to more than 1,000 tons. The actual sales of spot goods were sluggish, and the prices were speculative. Only five or six thousand bags were traded.

Since the announcement of the cut-off of thick and thin Japonica national rice from outside the border, the price of all market goods has risen day by day. On the morning before yesterday, the price was 98 yuan per picul. In the afternoon, it was rumored that an astonishingly high price was opened. The original packaged Kunshan Japonica rice crossed the 100-yuan mark and reached 104 yuan. Yesterday, the price continued to rise in this state, rising by another two yuan. It was heard that the original packaged Kunshan Japonica rice opened at the highest peak of 106.5 yuan, and the price of a picul was also 100 yuan. The special original packaged thin rice was 102 yuan to 100 yuan, and the price of a picul was 97 or 8 yuan. Du Yangjian still had no market. This year's New Year, the so-called rice price of 100 yuan per picul, speculative rice merchants rely on external forces to get their wish, and even exceed it.

Due to the foreign glutinous rice being restricted by the foreign rice, the sales of national glutinous rice have also turned sluggish. However, the price has not changed because the owners are unwilling to relax due to the limited chips. The price of Yili cargo is still 95 yuan, Hong Kong white is 86 yuan to 84 yuan, and glutinous rice is 75 yuan to 72.5 yuan.

Foreign rice arrived in Shanghai one after another. Yesterday, Yihai Foreign Bank's Fusheng wheel brought 1,016 bags from Hong Kong, and Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel also brought 9,992 bags from Hong Kong. The two wheels arrived in port yesterday morning and berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf and the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload foreign rice. Foreign rice is constantly arriving, and the price of rice continues to rise sharply. The livelihood of ordinary people is worrying. I don't know when it will be leveled. (Zu)

### Foreign Flour Continues to Rise

Flour: Yesterday's foreign flour market was short of domestic flour, and those who needed it paid attention to foreign flour. There were also guest gangs transshipping goods, and the sales market became more widespread. The whole market sold more than 10,000 bags of Australian foreign flour, such as Bell Tower, Flower Bird, and Spleen. The spot price was 22.2 yuan to 20 yuan, and the road cargo also reached the 20-yuan mark. The rising trend can be said to be rapid. However, it is heard that the price of rice has rebounded, and people's minds have gradually become stable. It is also heard that a ship of foreign flour will arrive around the 10th of this month, with a quota of more than 200,000 bags. At that time, the market may be able to suppress the price. As for the Chinese factory's flour, the wholesale volume is still more than 8,000 bags, and the factory price is still 18 yuan.

Wheat: Yesterday's transaction still had no special development. The price of wheat stored in the concession warehouses must be 29 yuan, and the Chinese factory has not accepted it for the time being. However, it is rumored that Sanxin Factory has again received more than 30,000 bags of futures, priced at 28 yuan, all for delivery in the second half of December, and will be delivered one after another. As for those received at the stores, the number is only two or three hundred bags.

### Securities: Foreign Debt Soars, Domestic Debt Also Advances

London, 3rd (Tuesday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks show strong market sentiment for Chinese foreign debt, with most bonds rising by one pound. Previous British-German loans (British issue) were at 38.5 pounds, Sino-French-American gold at 41 to 46 pounds, British-French loans (British issue) at 43 pounds, Crisp at 20 pounds, Reorganization Loan (British issue) at 31 pounds, and Vickers Airplane Loan at 10 pounds. Subsequent railway bonds: Beining at 47 pounds, Daowei at 16 pounds, Huguang (non-German issue) and Jinghu at 15 pounds, Longhai at 14 pounds, Huguang (German issue) and Jinpu subsequent issues at 13 pounds each, and Guangjiu at 12 pounds. Far Eastern stocks: bank stocks fluctuated slightly. Mercantile Bank shares rose 2 shillings 6 pence to 7 pounds 7 shillings 6 pence. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) London-registered shares rose one pound to 70 pounds, while Hong Kong-registered shares fell three pounds to 70 pounds. There were offers but no buyers; the rest remained unchanged.

Securities Grey Market: Yesterday's market gradually showed opportunity. After a multi-day stalemate between bulls and bears, the bulls still held the upper hand. The environment showed gradual and significant changes. Following the American loan, there are rumors of large loans from other friendly nations. Although still in the rumor stage, realization is not far off. Maintaining the legal tender has gradually gained strength, and it is rumored that the government is considering a considerable extension of commercial exchange rates. Government bonds have thus entered a period of resurgence, with investment gradually increasing and market prices rising daily. The future should see new developments. Yesterday morning, No. 16 first bought Huai Bingzhong (淮丙種), raising the price by three or four jiao. Hongda Huaiwei (鴻大淮胃) was also extremely strong. Others, such as Yitai (怡泰), Tongda (同大), Tongkang (同康), Lianhe (聯和), and Lianyi (聯益), also saw considerable covering or new positions. The sluggish market price thus showed some vitality. In the afternoon, the news was very strong, all favoring the bulls. Hongda and others continued to buy, and Shunchang (順昌), Tongshun (同順), and Changkang (長康) all showed demand. Lianyi and Lianhe offered some supply. Bingbo (丙伯) once reached four yuan. Yitai resurfaced, and Dechang (德昌) and Runli (潤利) also had some selling, falling back a jiao or two. Xie Kang (協康), Sheng Da (生大), Sheng Chang (牲昶), and No. 64 came to collect Bing (丙), and the price rose again. The situation was firm and brisk, and the market's purchasing power was extremely strong. The result was a unanimous rebound of two or three jiao to seven jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated at two million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:

Stock Transactions: 200 shares of Rengyuan Land Company were transacted at a price of 26.5 yuan.

Public Industry Exchange Stock Market: The opening was still weak, but soon recovered to a stable position. Both bulls and bears saw little large-scale trading. Jardine Matheson once fell to 82.5 yuan, but closed back at 84 yuan. There is reason to believe that the new shares of Shanghai Woolen Company, which open for subscription tomorrow, will be heavily oversubscribed. This point may be sufficient to improve the general market situation in the future. Rubber stocks were quiet and stable.

Finance: Foreign Exchange Sellers Follow Each Other, Rumors of Extending the Chongqing Commercial Exchange Rate, Generally Believed Unrealizable at This Time

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. The grey market for British and American exchange rates remained on a downward trend, with selling pressure continuous, especially with Hong Kong Electric (港電) forcefully yielding ground. Midway, there were also rumors that the Chongqing commercial exchange rate would be changed to 6 pence for British exchange and 10 yuan for American exchange, a larger extension than previous rumors. However, it is generally believed that this will not be realized, because if it were realized, it would be as Suma, spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: "This American loan may indirectly benefit Japanese commerce in China." Therefore, if the government does not have strong management methods for the Shanghai exchange market, forcibly maintaining foreign exchange and then extending it would not be a blessing for China. Therefore, to the greatest extent possible, raising the foreign exchange level within the free China region might be a possibility, but even then, implementing it immediately without preparation would inevitably affect the Shanghai market. However, the future of legal tender is ultimately optimistic, so there will eventually be a day when foreign exchange is extended, but under the current circumstances, it is not yet the time. The Chongqing telegram from the previous day mentioned a certain powerful nation providing economic assistance to China, a loan for purchasing tungsten and tin. Yesterday, there were rumors of a British loan and a Soviet loan to China. As a result, people in the foreign exchange market were excited yesterday, and speculators sold in droves. The hardest American exchange opened at 6 yuan, with considerable transactions. At the midday closing price, British gold was 3 pence 78125, and American exchange was 5 yuan 96875. In the afternoon, Wednesday saw no market. Compared to the previous day, British and American exchange rates were harder by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively. Futures were in line with spot prices.

### Speculative Hong Kong Traders All Sold

In the early morning, London large bars, recent forward prices rebounded by 0.0625, New York silver prices were stable, London raw gold was stagnant, exchange rates for British against American unchanged, against Shanghai rising by 0.03125, American against British unchanged, against Shanghai stable, no market for against French exchange. Central listed prices for various exchanges remained as before. Bank morning opening spot selling price: British gold 3 pence 765625, American exchange 5 yuan 9375, the same as the previous day's closing price. At the opening, Zhengjin (正金) once first bought American exchange for the current month at 5 yuan 9375 from foreign banks. Before long, telegrams came to fill in. Zhengjin then sold the same month's American exchange, calculated from advantageous and certain American banks entering at 5 yuan 9375 to 96875. HSBC listed prices were revealed, unanimously unchanged. The silver equalization tax was also announced as stable. Afterward, there was a time when the Feihu (費戶) suspended, and the tax collection softened, but soon the China Bank (華銀行) did spot transactions in shillings, cheap at 3 pence 796875. At that time, speculators forcefully sold, Hong Kong Electric continued to sell, and prices broke down. American exchange reached the 6 yuan mark. It is estimated that American banks and foreign banks absorbed their American exchange for the current month at 6 yuan. Midday closing prices were still stable, with both spot and near-term British gold reported at 3 pence 78125, and American exchange at 5 yuan 96875. Compared to the previous day's spot prices, near-term British rose by 0.015625, and American hardened by 0.03125. Next month's British and American softened by 0.03125 and 0.0625 respectively.

New York telegraphic transfer rose by 2.25, to 6 yuan 53125. Shanghai exchange fell by 2.5 yuan, to 89.5 yuan. "Lianchao (聯鈔)" grey market cheapened by 2.25 yuan, to 89 yuan.

### Amidst a Wave of Bearish Sentiment, Gold Prices Plunge

Yesterday's grey market for gold saw an increasingly sharp decline. The price had already entered the 5,800 yuan range. There were rumors of Chongqing commercial listed prices being extended, and a certain head company in western Shanghai came to sell. People's hearts were greatly exhausted. The opening was as low as 5,780 yuan, and gold shops continued to sell for 30 yuan. Thereafter, there was an unexpected rise. Silver shops and money houses tended to cover short positions of about 2,000 taels, which saw a rise to 5,820 yuan. Before long, negative rumors suddenly arose, and the foreign exchange softening trend suddenly moved. Moreover, the Minhao (岷號) gang and the substituting draft merchants and the bull companies came to sell, resulting in a retreat to 5,725 yuan, and finally to 5,730 yuan, 85 yuan less. After the close, it retreated again to 5,720 yuan with no buyers. Half-day transactions totaled 5,000 several hundred taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. Cash was 10 yuan lower than forward prices. Gold shops and silver shops offered dozens of taels to money houses, and two silver shops did swaps of 60 taels each. The buyer posted 12 yuan to the seller, and jewelry was listed for 10 yuan less, to 590 yuan. Customs gold and other items were stable.

### Raw Gold Falls 83 Yuan

The morning started extremely sluggish, with buying interest depressed. A gold shop first sold 20 taels to a silver shop at 5,780 yuan, opening 30 or so yuan lower than the previous day. Gold and silver shops sold together, falling another 30 yuan, with silver shops doing 30 taels at 5,750 yuan. At this time, the foreign exchange rose slowly, and scattered households saw the cheapness and rushed to buy, causing a recovery. The securities gang entered 20 taels into the silver shop at 5,800 yuan. Instantly, the gold shop wanted to sell, pushing down another 20 yuan, with the Yuhao (余號) offering 30 taels to the money exchange at 5,780 yuan. Relying on silver shops and money exchange suddenly buying up, it rose out of the 800 yuan mark, with the securities gang entering 20 taels into the gold shop, rising to 5,820 yuan. Unexpectedly, the good times did not last, and a grand selling trend arose. The foreign exchange reported softening, and the American exchange reached 6 yuan. Gold and silver shops all sold, falling miserably to 5,725 yuan, with the Jin gang (金　) selling 10 taels to the silver shop. As a result, silver shops did 30 taels at 5,730 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday, 83 yuan lower than the day before yesterday. Half-day trading fell 90 yuan. The wood-plate gold selling price of cash gold shops was more than 10 yuan higher than raw gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower.

### Jewelry Also Listed 10 Yuan Lower

Jewelers' gold exchange price fell by 10 yuan per tael, with Da Tong Hang (大同行) changing the view to 590 yuan. Xin Tong Hang (新同行) was similar to the previous price, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower, it is said.

Next Year's Bank Holiday Schedule

The holiday schedule for member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association in the Republic of China Year 30 has been determined and is copied below:

Uneven Supply and Demand for Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw erratic raw gold prices, which eventually continued to fall. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. The supply and demand for British gold notes were even, and market prices stood firm. American gold notes fluctuated erratically, initially retreating to 16 yuan 7 jiao 2 fen, then gradually rising to 8 jiao called, then retreating to 5 jiao 7 fen, and finally to 16 yuan 6 jiao 2 fen, 1 jiao 8 fen lower than the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose slightly due to infrequent demand. Japanese gold notes rose and then fell back, with the evening market at 1 yuan 5 jiao 3 fen. Korean notes still saw strong demand, with the evening market as high as 1 yuan 2 jiao 1 fen.

### Yarn and Cotton: Gold Spear Gang Sells in Large Quantities, Yarn Prices Plunge

The yarn market entered another period of fluctuation, but actual trading was still considered good. The Hong Kong gang was remarkably strong for 32-count single yarn, so in addition to the 32-count dog girl (犬女) rising by 30 yuan alone, the industry's morale was boosted. However, the general gold gang held speculative ideas. Because the price of gold was high, the yarn was weighed in jin (斤). If it was the opposite, it would come out at one time and five points. Rumors arose in the market, saying that the elimination was negative. The gold gang sold unanimously, suddenly falling by more than 10 yuan, and then slightly rebounding, but the industry still bought. Today, 2,510 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma (雙馬) opened in the morning with a harmonious and nourishing momentum, with the first plate price at 1,228 yuan. The market was still calm, and the price fell to 1,225 yuan. It was then heard that the Hong Kong gang continued to have good demand for existing yarn, and the selling price of 32-count ma danu (馬大女) jumped up by 20 to 30 yuan. At the same time, the foreign exchange rose and then shrunk slightly. Thus, buying momentum spread, and the general short sellers rushed to cover the market. The market opened more and more tightly, rising directly to 1,243 yuan, but some profitable bulls sold off, and the situation became flat again. It was close to 11:30 when it returned. After that, rumors suddenly arose that the foreign exchange would be extended, and in an instant, the gold gang also came to sell in large quantities. The situation changed rapidly, falling straight to 1,225 or 6 yuan, but a certain large yarn number continued to absorb it. The closing price returned to 1,129 yuan. The statistics for the number of bags traded in half a day were 5,450 bags. The price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 10 yuan. The amounts of each gang's mouth risk are listed below:

Same Industry 4,600 Hong Kong 570 Tianjin 270 Ningbo 10 Total 5,450

### Cotton Mill Stomach Slightly Active

The current cotton situation is improving, because the sources of supply from all sides are not refreshing, and the procedures are extremely troublesome, and the risks are very large, so inventories are decreasing daily. Among the same industry, there is an eager search for Miterlin cotton. Therefore, the foundation of the cotton market is becoming increasingly solid.

In other news, the foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was firm from the start, first due to purchases by speculators, and then due to government reports of an increase in the amount of cotton used by domestic yarn mills in the United States. At the same time, the industry also purchased very enthusiastically. As a result, the closing price rose by six or seven pounds compared to the previous day. India stopped the market, and it is predicted that it will rise by more than one rupee.

Shanghai Port Foreign Cotton Trading: The factory side was more active, with quite a buying intention, but limited to spot goods, and the number was also limited, with 20-count raw materials being the majority. The Japanese factory force also slightly procured.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Reaches a Tired Market

The factory cloth market fell slightly yesterday and showed a rotating trend. It is rumored that a new Sino-Soviet loan will be established, foreign exchange will be extended, raw yarn will tend to fall, and cloth prices will be frustrated. White goods, coarse and fine cloths, and twills were mostly stable, with small amounts falling by 1 to 2 jiao. Bleached and dyed cloths were mixed. Heavy-sized and lower-end clean water bleached cloths and mercerized Prussian blue cloths were the most firm, due to higher demand in the market. Transactions on this street included 700+ pieces of raw cloth, bleached and dyed cloth, and flannel. The Guangdong-Hong Kong gang bought 300+ pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and pongee. The Zhejiang-Fujian gang also bought 100+ pieces. The North Road Yantai gang bought 100+ pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Because Eastern yarn continued to decline, the market was slightly soft. Dragon head fine cloth fell by 1 or 2 jiao per piece, and the closing price was 35 yuan 5 jiao. Mid-range fine cloth was still quite firm due to strong demand on this street, rising by 1 or 2 jiao. Si Jun (四君)干嗶嘰 opened in the morning at 1 yuan 09 fen 25, and the market returned to 1 yuan 08 fen 625.

Exports: Yesterday, 3,290 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 29 pieces were shipped to Singapore.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Stockpilers Sell, Oil Bean Rising Momentum Slightly Killed

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market situation was that various rumors such as gold falling and exchange softening were not true. It was also affected by the steep fall in rice prices, and speculative rice weevils were particularly disheartened, so the rising wind was suppressed. After a strict opening, most of the stockpilers inside and outside the industry stopped advancing and started to sell. Blind followers also mostly watched with their hands tied, so the market situation gradually turned flat. As a result, the spot price of raw soybean oil fell by about half a yuan, and futures saw a fall of yuan and a half. Soybeans also showed a flat and tired appearance. Tongshi (統市) sold a large amount of factory soybean oil, 300 dan, Yanqi (烟歧) soybean oil, 30 pieces, Jiaozhou (膠州) soybean oil, 50 pieces, Jiaozhou raw oil, 300 pieces, and another 100 pieces of new goods. Yantai raw oil, 50 pieces, Qingdao raw oil, 45 barrels, another 1,200 barrels in the lower half of December, and another 450 barrels in the February period. Tianjin Jinyuan (金元), 180 bags, Qingdao black soybeans, 100 bags.

### Coal: Second Batch of Hongji Coal Arrives, Totaling 9,000 Tons

Since the 7,000 tons of Hongji white coal arrived a month ago, the second batch of orders arrived yesterday, transported by the French merchant shipping company "Arcade" (阿卡脫) wheel battle, including 3,000 tons of lump coal and 6,000 tons of coal chips. The vehicles were lined up at the Bund wharf, and Yi Tai Xing (義泰興) and Nanyang (南洋) banks were managing the sales. In addition to a portion to resolve old Zhaidan (老棧單), the majority can be supplied to the industry for dismantling and retail sales to customers.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Soften Back

Yesterday's sugar market softened as foreign exchange recovered and rose. The association's panel set the spot price for 24 coarse white Wai Zhaidan (外棧) at 72 yuan 7 jiao, small triangle, Dutch cotton white K mark at 72 yuan, Dutch red spot at 56 yuan 3 jiao, small four corners, ordering on the 10th of this month at 56 yuan 7 jiao, small triangle, Taigu (太古) car white B mark four Zhaidan at 75 yuan 6 jiao, small five corners, DY West Zhaidan 69 yuan 3 jiao, East Zhaidan 69 yuan 2 jiao, later slightly tightened to 69 yuan half, HX mark four Zhaidan 69 yuan, East Zhaidan the same price, later rising to 69 yuan 2 jiao half, still falling 5 jiao to 9 jiao compared to the previous day. 5,400 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong on the 3rd, and another 468 bags came on the 4th.

### North-South Goods: Xinghua Longan Plunges

Since the first batch of Xinghua longan arrived in dozens of dan, the source was difficult to transport out, resulting in an interruption for a long time. Recently, a batch continued to arrive, but miscellaneous road sources have been arriving continuously, and the market price has dropped a lot. Therefore, Xingyuan (興圓) is no exception. When a batch was opened yesterday, the degree of decline reached 40% strong, almost half the difference from the first market.

### The Shanghai Western Border Police Finally Established an Agreement. Once the So-Called "Approval" Procedures Are Completed, the "City Police" Will Enter the Bureau's Jurisdiction.

According to an announcement by the Information Office of the Public Works Department, regarding the issue of police power in the Shanghai Western Border Road area, an agreement has been reached as a result of discussions between the Police Commissioner and Lu Ying. This agreement must still be approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department and the "Shanghai Special Municipality," and it is expected to be officially sent to the Public Works Department by the "Municipal Government" soon.

Details Revealed - Increased Numbers

Regarding the "Joint Issue" of the Shanghai Western Border Road Construction Area, the final agreement was reached yesterday by Police Chief Superintendent Bao Wen and Municipal Police Bureau Chief Lu Ying. According to Bao, this agreement is a handwritten document that has been submitted to the Public Works Department for approval. He also stated that previously, Bao Wen and Lu Ying had directly negotiated various key points in the agreement, but the establishment of the agreement was through the exchange of official documents. Although the content of the agreement has not been released, authoritative sources say that the number of joint police powers will be greater than that previously stipulated by the Public Works Department and Chuan Xiao'an. It is also understood that the leader of the "Joint Police Powers" will be appointed by the "Municipal Government," and the deputy leader will be appointed by the Public Works Department, with these two acting as liaison officers between the two parties. The final agreement was reached after several months of negotiations between the two police authorities. The temporary agreement was signed a year ago, at which time the "City Police" immediately moved into the Border Road Construction Area, which was previously under the jurisdiction of the Public Concession Police Department.

Original Proposed Terms - Many Changes

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" stated that a spokesperson for the Public Works Department officially disclosed this morning (4th) that the police chiefs of the Public Concession and the "City" have reached a final agreement today regarding the establishment of a joint police force in the Shanghai Western Border Road area. The full text will soon be submitted to the "City Government" for approval. Details of the agreement could not be officially announced this morning, but it is heard that Public Works Department Police Chief Bao Wen and "City Police Bureau Chief" Lu Ying have reached a satisfactory agreement after two months of discussion regarding the establishment of the West District Joint Police Force. It is expected that some changes will be made to the terms stipulated in the draft agreement concluded between the Public Concession authorities and Chuan Xiao'an. The biggest change is that the total number of police stations established in the Border Road area will be increased after the establishment of the Joint Police Force. In addition, those in charge believe that the head of the Joint Police Force will be a Chinese person appointed by the "Municipal Government," while the deputy commander will be appointed by the Public Concession authorities to serve as a liaison between the two parties.

### National Postal Transportation Network to Be Completed Within the Year - Restoring the Postal Transportation System

In order to restore the postal transportation system, the Ministry of Transportation has decided to establish a postal transportation network throughout sixteen provinces and has issued an order to complete it by the end of the 29th year. At present, seven provinces, including Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Guangxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and Hubei, have postal transportation routes that can transport goods, using means of transport such as back carriers, livestock, handcarts, and human labor. Currently, postal transportation from Kunming in the southwest and Lanzhou in the northwest can directly connect to Chongqing. The postal transportation networks in southeastern provinces such as Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Henan have been assigned personnel for deployment and are expected to be completed within the year.

### Moyler, H. O.

Returned to Shanghai the Night Before Last, Took Leave of Absence Yesterday Morning

Customs Inspector General Moyler, H. O., left Shanghai for South China and the Philippines on the 9th of last month. He originally planned to return to Shanghai from Hong Kong via the Philippines at the end of last month, but because the Changxing Company's "Asian Empress" ship was requisitioned by the British Navy for military use on the 29th of last month, he changed to the Jardine Matheson Company's "Evershine" ship. He arrived in Shanghai the afternoon before yesterday and went to the Shanghai office of the Customs Inspectorate General as usual yesterday morning to work as usual.

### Wenzhou Compatriots Remit 50,000 Yuan to Relieve the Yongjia Rice Famine

The Wenzhou Shanghai Compatriot Association has established the Yongjia Rice Famine Relief Committee to relieve the Yongjia rice famine and has organized a fundraising association to widely solicit donations from Wenzhou compatriots in Shanghai and various industries. It has already raised 50,000 yuan and remitted it to Wenzhou a few days ago. Yesterday, the association also hired Yu Qiaqing and others as honorary chairmen, preparing to actively raise funds to relieve their hometown.

### Zhu Boquan - Now Safe

Zhu Has Returned Home Safely Yesterday Morning

Zhu Boquan, Chairman of the Shanghai Clearing House, after being kidnapped on Yidingpan Road on the 29th of last month, sources say that Zhu returned home safely yesterday morning. However, details of his escape have not been ascertained.

Not Involving Money - Fear of Background

The "Continental News" reported that Shanghai banker Zhu Boquan has been kidnapped for many days and is still missing. Recently, a friend of Zhu stated that Zhu's family has not yet received notification from the kidnappers and has not been able to make contact with the kidnappers. Considering the kidnappers' long silence, it is feared that this crime has a political background and its motives are not in extorting ransom. According to reports, Zhu was kidnapped on his way to the office at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Haig Road. After the incident, the banking industry in this city speculated about the case, suspecting that it was masterminded by political elements. Those people had once sought Zhu's services for a certain financial undertaking but were refused, so they resorted to kidnapping to force Zhu to comply. The Concession police authorities still claim to be unaware of the kidnapping case. It is said that if Zhu was kidnapped, it must have occurred outside the Concession area. It is also heard that Zhu's driver once returned to Zhu's residence at 600 Haig Road after the incident and then disappeared, and his whereabouts have not been ascertained.

### Large-Scale Fire at the Dajiao Japanese Airport Yesterday - Burning for Several Hours - Multiple Aircraft Destroyed

A large fire suddenly broke out at the Dajiao Japanese Airport yesterday afternoon. It is said that multiple aircraft and many boxes of command flags were burned in the fire, resulting in huge losses. The fire burned for two or three hours before being extinguished. Afterwards, the Japanese military police, together with the "City Police," expelled all ships parked on the Suzhou River and MacKen Road Bridge and prohibited them from staying, which is said to be related to the negligence at the Dajiao Airport.

### Shanghai West Blockade - After Negotiations - The Situation Shows Some Relaxation - Allowed to Import Food But Must Be Inspected - House-to-House Searches Not Stopped Yesterday

After three days of strict restrictions imposed by the Japanese side in the blockade zone next to Yidingpan Road, the situation gradually eased yesterday morning (4th). However, Japanese military police are still conducting house-to-house searches within the blockade zone. According to police disclosures, foreigners traveling along Yidingpan Road the night before were subjected to slight checks by Japanese military police. Chinese were allowed to pass without encountering major difficulties, with only those carrying packages being inspected. When an English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reporter asked various officials yesterday morning how long the Japanese blockade was expected to last, they were unable to say for sure.

Consular Group Negotiated - Situation Gradually Loosened

However, according to an official from a certain consulate, after the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Horiuchi, discussed the blockade with the Danish Consul General and Leader of the Consular Corps, Heer, close cooperation is now being provided. It is heard that during the discussion between the Danish and Japanese consuls, they amicably agreed that the Japanese authorities would only take the necessary measures against terrorists in the western district and would remove the blockade as soon as possible within the possible scope. Food, mail, and other essential items will also be allowed to be sent into the blockade zone, but must be inspected. Police sources said yesterday morning that the Japanese military police are currently conducting searches aimed at discovering "nests" of terrorists in winding alleys. However, the Japanese authorities remained silent on the blockade yesterday morning and did not disclose any information about arrests.

Most Foreigners - Enjoy Consular Jurisdiction

"Zi Lin Daily" reported that after a Japanese military policeman was assassinated on Daxilu last Saturday and Sunday, the Japanese authorities immediately imposed restrictions in the "bad land" area. According to news yesterday (3rd), after the Shanghai Consular Corps negotiated with the Japanese side, these restrictions were slightly relaxed, and foreigners felt relieved upon hearing the news. Heer, the leader of the consular corps, met with Japanese Consul General Horiuchi yesterday afternoon to exchange views on the western district blockade. It is heard that when Heer met Horiuchi, he expressed regret on behalf of the Consular Corps over the assassination of the Japanese, but stated that he hoped the blockade would be lifted as soon as possible within the possible scope. He also stated that foreigners in the area were greatly inconvenienced by the Japanese measures. Heer also requested that the Japanese side exercise as much caution as possible when searching foreigners and their cars, because most foreigners in the area enjoy consular jurisdiction and are not subject to searches by others.

More Than a Hundred Chinese - Have Been Arrested

In addition, Heer also requested that the Japanese side allow doctors, students, and food to enter and leave the blockade zone. Horiuchi replied that the Japanese side had no intention of harming foreigners in the area, but the Japanese side had no other way to take measures, so the Japanese side would maintain the blockade until it deemed it unnecessary to search. The Japanese search has been going on for three days. According to reliable sources, the Japanese side has arrested more than 100 Chinese during these three days. Regarding the search of foreigners' cars, Horiuchi expressed his apologies but said that it was necessary because the Japanese side knew that the assassins had hidden their weapons in cars parked by the roadside for smuggling, and the drivers in the cars were unaware of it. This is the reason for the Japanese search. As for the food problem for the Chinese in the blockade zone, it has been affected the most. It is heard that the rice in the area has been completely bought up. Eggs are sold for eight cents each, meat for three yuan per pound, and coal balls for only 30 cents per yuan.

Qianjia Lane - Was Once Open

According to an interview with a reporter from the "Pingming News Agency," the scope of the blockade by the Japanese side is from Difeng Road to Yidingpan Road in the east and from Daxilu to Yuyuan Road in the south. The residents in this area have lost their freedom. In the Qianjia Lane of Yuyuan Road, a gap had been opened in the broken walls demolished by the Japanese side, but by the afternoon, it was sealed off again. Only women and young children were allowed to enter and exit, and it was strictly forbidden to carry items out.

Chinese and Western Students - Can Now Enter and Exit

The Shanghai Western Border Road Labor Bureau Chinese Children's Public School and Daxilu Labor Bureau Primary School are also within the blockade line. However, for students to enter and exit, the Japanese side has opened a gap at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Heping Road, allowing Chinese and foreign students to enter and exit. When most Western children go to school and leave school, they form groups and are led by teachers to prevent accidents. The gap is only used for students to enter and exit. Other Westerners, Japanese, and vehicles are restricted to one location at the corner of Daxilu and Difeng Road.

Food Problem - Is the Most Serious

For the residents trapped in the blockade zone, the most serious problem is the food supply. All food stores are unwilling to sell food to prevent a long-term blockade, making it impossible for residents to obtain food. Yesterday, hundreds of residents stood by the obstacles on Jing'an Temple Road and Heping Road, waiting for acquaintances to ask for food relief. According to a woman in the boundary, her husband works in the Concession. After the incident on the 30th of last month, he has not been able to return home. Because of this, the family's economy has suddenly become depleted, and the children are crying from hunger and cold, which is extremely painful.

Wangjia Lane Houses - Will Be Demolished

After Japanese Sergeant Sasaki was shot and killed in Wangjia Lane at Daxilu, the blockade on Yuyuan Road and Daxilu in Shanghai West was expanded and is still continuing. It is learned that the location of the incident was in Wangjia Lane. The Japanese side sent personnel to measure the area yesterday and erected red flags at the entrance of Wangjia Lane. It is reported that the Japanese side has decided to demolish the houses in the lane and widen it into a road, following the example of Qianjia Lane.

### Demands of Chinese Constables and Firefighters: Bureau Meeting for Discussion, Gathering This Afternoon for Comprehensive Planning, Expected Satisfactory Resolution After Research

According to highly reliable sources, regarding the requests for improved treatment from Chinese constables and firefighters under the Public Works Department, the Public Works Department has decided to convene a meeting of the Personnel Committee this afternoon for a comprehensive discussion. Those requesting improved treatment are not limited to the aforementioned two departments; the matter concerns the entire financial situation, hence the need for thorough research.

Firefighter Demands: Expected Approval

According to foreign sources, the eight demands made by the 700 Chinese firefighters of the Public and Concession Fire Department were submitted to Fire Department Chief Captain Liddell on Tuesday (the 3rd). The Public Works Department is currently studying these demands. The Public Works Department believes that the demands are generally likely to be approved. As for the demands made by the Chinese constables, they have been submitted to the police department official in charge. At the same time, it is reported that Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing has expressed his willingness to donate 20,000 yuan to serve as the foundation for a Chinese constable mutual aid association, and to raise another 30,000 yuan to support the endeavor.

Chinese Constables Await Reply: Determined to Serve Peacefully

Another report states that regarding the issue of Chinese constables in the Public Concession requesting improved treatment, after the representatives of the Chinese constables submitted the various terms of their demands to the Deputy Chief Inspector of the Chinese Police Department the day before yesterday, the necessary steps are now being taken to handle the matter. It is expected that these terms will be submitted to Chief Executive Fessenden today, to be decided by the Board of Directors. At most, it will take one or two days, as the Chinese constables have requested that the authorities reply by Saturday afternoon. It is said that the Chinese and Western directors alike deeply desire an early resolution to this matter. If the demands do not have a major impact on the financial revenue and expenditure of the Public Works Department, it is highly likely that the Board of Directors will approve them. As for the Chinese constables, they are determined to work peacefully before receiving a reply, so as to ensure stable public order. Everything will be resolved through reasonable methods.

Public Association Meeting: Rice Industry Agrees

Immediately began the discussion. (1) Regarding the proposal for public granaries submitted by the Public Works Department for discussion, it was resolved that the proposal for public granaries submitted by the Public Works Department, with the aim of stabilizing rice prices and regulating food supply for the people, is well-intentioned and a good method. The industry associations of both public associations should agree with it. Regarding the subscription of 60,000 bags by the grain industry, they should also strive to take responsibility. However, as the industry's funds are limited and their business is not limited to rice alone, they rely on mutual support for capital turnover. Therefore, it is requested that the subscribed 60,000 bags can be freely bought and sold, and upon selling, they should immediately re-subscribe to replenish the amount. The above opinions will be represented by representatives to reply to the authorities, requesting approval in order to comply. At the same time, they will first advise the industry to continue to subscribe in large quantities as soon as possible, hoping that the rice price can be quickly stabilized. Starting from today, the number of subscriptions made will be registered with the association for calculation. (2) How to clear and stop the rice market in the afternoon was discussed, and it was resolved that the New Grain Industry Association should notify the brokers' association to copy all the brokers' lists to the association. All rice brokers will be refused entry into the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange, and their entry permits will be temporarily suspended. The remaining cases were omitted. The meeting adjourned at 5:15. In addition to posting the above resolutions in the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange Market today, the two associations also decided to send Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and others to meet with the authorities tomorrow morning to report the various measures taken by the two associations. The ban on brokers entering the market will also be notified to the on-site supervisors and association members from today to ensure strict attention and completely eliminate rice and grain transactions in the market. The rice industry has also decided to continue to subscribe for 100,000 bags of foreign rice, and registration will begin immediately, which has been posted in rice shops and miscellaneous grain markets. The registration address is on the third floor of 15 Avenue Edward VII.

Assuming Responsibility for Granary Rice: Allocation of Quantities

Yu Qiaqing suggested that the concession authorities establish public granaries to store 200,000 bags of rice and grain, supplying the market to reassure the people and increase the spot goods. The 200,000 bags of stored rice should be replenished daily to prevent shortages. However, this matter is significant and relies on the cooperation of all sectors. Now, we explore the allocation of quantities for assuming responsibility for the stored rice as follows: (1) Enthusiastic people from all walks of life, 50,000 bags; (2) Silver and money industry, 50,000 bags; (3) Rice industry, 60,000 bags; (4) Other institutions and organizations, 40,000 bags. Each bag is paid for in advance by the subscribers at 32 yuan per bag, totaling 6.4 million national currency. The remaining half will be mortgaged and loaned by the silver and money industry to the respective subscribers after the rice arrives at the port, and it is stipulated that the goods should be shipped out within six months, and a considerable profit can be added when the goods are shipped out and sold. Now, Mr. Yu Qiaqing has personally sent the suggestion to the Public Works Department for review and handling.

Hongkou Stacked Rice: Already Available for Shipment

According to rice industry sources, the Japanese side approved the relocation of the rice stored in Hongkou to the concession for sale yesterday, but only allowed transportation by water, not by land. It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will raise this matter for negotiation. According to a reporter from the New Sound Society, the current quantity of rice flour stored in Hongkou has reached 100,000 bags, which can meet the needs of the citizens for two weeks. There are three stacks there, namely the Gonghexing Stack in Fair Road, the Shuntai Stack next to the Yeeson Shipyard, and the Huasheng Stack in Dent Road. The scope of these three stacks is very large.

Group Purchase of Rice: How to Expand

Yesterday, a letter from someone concerned about rice prices stated that the city of Shanghai has a population of about 4 million people, and 800,000 households of the bourgeoisie can be regarded as one-fifth of the total. The remaining three-quarters, or 3 million people (600,000 households), are mostly wage earners and those who struggle to make ends meet. Holding flat price sales cannot be popularized or sustained, and group purchases of rice can only be organized by employees of large companies and factories. Ordinary classes have no contact and lack organization. How can they seek group purchases? For the sake of the present, a long-term and fundamental solution should be sought for the vast majority of consumers who have no one to turn to for help. On behalf of the majority of consumers, a city-wide consumer cooperative group should be organized, advising the middle and lower classes to join together, raise funds to purchase rice directly, distribute it to members, and avoid exploitation by middlemen. All regulations should follow the principles of pure consumer cooperation. It may reduce difficulties if the municipal authorities come forward to negotiate. Some also advocate forming a food committee to investigate the amount of rice in Shanghai, as well as the owners, and limit the price to buy up all the rice within a specified period. If the owners fail to hand over the rice after the deadline, they should be confiscated and severely punished. It is also believed that the rice market is also responsible for the skyrocketing rice prices. If there is a rumor in the market, the owners will arbitrarily raise prices, and hoarders will rush to raise prices to collect rice. If all rice and grain are subject to prices set by the food committee, and all rights to buy and sell rice and grain are controlled by the committee, then there will be no need for the rice market to exist, and all kinds of malpractices can be eliminated.

Northeast Cold Wave: Will Not Affect Shanghai

Reports say that the weather in Northeast China is severe and it is snowing heavily. Checking the climate in Shanghai, it is often affected by the Siberian high pressure. The northeast cold wave is an attack by the high pressure. A reporter from the Datong News Agency inquired from the observatory that there is no strong high pressure occurring in Siberia, and the climate in this city will not be affected by it.

### Authorities and Rice Industry Discuss Establishing Public Granaries to Store Grain, Rice Industry Subscribes to 60,000 Bags of Granary Rice, But Requests Permission for Free Trading

The Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association held a temporary joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members of the two industry associations at 3:00 p.m. yesterday at the association's location at 15 Avenue Edward VII. Zhu Ziyao, Xing Zhigang, Chen Shide, Jiang Hongbin, Yang Heqing, and others, totaling 15 people, were present. Chen Ziyi was elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman first stood up to report the purpose of the meeting, stating that the rice market is full of rumors, and people are uneasy. The rice price has risen by more than ten yuan per stone compared to before. The authorities care about the people's suffering and invited people to meet with Deputy Chief Executive He DeKui of the Public Works Department a few days ago to discuss the entire issue of food for the people. All agreed that the soaring rice price is related to the people's livelihood and social order. As a result of the discussion, the rice industry was instructed to continue to subscribe to 100,000 bags of foreign rice and 60,000 bags of public granary grain. The representatives promised to inform the industry and reply again. This measure by the authorities is admirable. It is hoped that everyone present will discuss it at length and jointly maintain food for the people. The committee members also expressed their opinions.

### Four Detained Foreign Vessels: Still Held and Not Released, Several Passengers Also Suffering Bad Luck, But Food Supply Not Expected to Be Lacking

The Continental News reports that visitors from Wenzhou last week said that three German ships and one Chinese ship detained by the Japanese navy near Wenzhou last month are still held outside the port of Zhejiang Province. Several passengers from Southern Zhejiang to Shanghai on the ships are also being detained. The three German ships are the Elbhof of Reihher & Co., the Monlenhof, and the Pelikan of Rohllin & Co. The American ship is the Dasheng owned by Robert Dollar, chartered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The visitor from Wenzhou also said that there is no shortage of food supply for the detained ships, as the Japanese authorities allow the ship's cooks to go ashore to purchase supplies. However, the remaining people, including the foreign captains, are not allowed to move freely. The ship's radio room is guarded by Japanese sailors, and crew members are prohibited from communicating with Shanghai companies. According to shipping industry sources, the US Consulate authorities lodged a second protest with the Japanese Consul General last week regarding the detention of the Dasheng, and are still awaiting a reply.

### British Community in Shanghai: Striving for Wartime Work, Meeting to Review the Situation of One Year's Work, Veterans Promoting Wartime Service

The British Association of Shanghai held its ninth annual general meeting at the Race Club yesterday. A large number of British citizens participated. The meeting was chaired by the President of the Association, An Hord, who reported on the economic situation of the past year and discussed the work of the Association's Wartime Work Committee over the past year. He highly praised the committee's more than 100 representatives for their efforts in publicity, film screenings, and charity stamp sales, and urged the British community to cooperate in the Christmas raffle and auction. Then, Vice President Hawkins read the report of the London Committee. Finally, the entire body voted to re-elect the executive committee members. The association currently has 4,000 members, double the number of previous years.

Veterans Support the Government

Seventy-one veterans of the last European War in the United Kingdom held a monthly meeting and dinner yesterday at the Royal Air Force Association club upstairs in the HSBC Building. They gathered together and enjoyed themselves with drinks. Members of the British United Services Association also almost all participated. All were in high spirits. Vice President Medaden then gave a speech, urging all veterans to vigorously promote wartime work, support the government, and fight with all their strength. All listeners were moved.

Royal Air Force to Host Banquet Tomorrow

The British Royal Air Force Association is scheduled to host a banquet for Mr. Woodhead at the association's club tomorrow.

Mr. Woodhead is British, and his son has given up writing to join the army and is serving in Singapore. The British Women's Association is also scheduled to hold a concert at the club at 4:45 p.m. tomorrow, with a very exciting program.

### Villages Destroyed After Train Bombed on Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, Villagers' Wives and Children Crying, Too Horrific to Bear

According to visitors from Suzhou, the Shanghai-Nanjing train was bombed by a landmine between Waitang and Guan Duli near Suzhou. The bodies of all the victims were piled up on the roadside for many days. Wild dogs devoured them fiercely, and the stench could be smelled for miles. Except for a few who were claimed by their families, the rest were covered in blood and flesh, and it was difficult to identify them. They were cremated by the Japanese in pits dug nearby. However, the Japanese were coffined and buried by Japanese personnel. The remaining injured passengers, now staying in Suzhou hospitals, still numbered around a hundred. The family members who went to inquire were almost all limited in number, and most of them were seriously injured. The train that was bombed and overturned on the roadside has been transported to Suzhou Station by workers hired by the Japanese. The Japanese army vented their anger on the villages near the scene of the accident. All the villages, large and small, have been burned to ashes. At this time of the year, when the north wind is whistling, all the innocent villagers who have no home to return to are crying, making it extremely tragic.

### Greater China Rubber Company Continues Strike, It is Feared That the Situation Will Not Subside for a While

The Greater China First Rubber Company at 1102 Xujiahui Road, French Concession, has more than 1,500 male and female workers. Recently, due to the failure to request improved treatment from the factory, a strike was officially announced at 2:30 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 3rd). The second factory of the factory on Bailinan Road, now named Jiaotong Rubber Company, also has more than 500 male and female workers, who also participated at the same time. A total of more than 2,000 workers from the two factories are on strike. They are still waiting at the factory for representatives from both labor and management to resolve the issue. However, work in the two factories has been completely stopped. According to a reporter from the P'ing Ming News Agency, on the 20th of last month, the labor side, considering that life is difficult at present and the monthly wages are not enough to maintain a living, made a request to the management to improve treatment, and 11 articles were agreed upon. Now, because the management has not fulfilled the agreed articles, the labor side also believes that the previously agreed articles are not entirely satisfactory, so it intends to re-propose 17 new conditions to the management. It is feared that the situation will not subside for a while.

### Hongqiao Road Telephone Line Stolen Again

The North China Daily News reports that, according to the Shanghai Telephone Company, a portion of the main telephone line in the Hongqiao area was stolen again yesterday morning. After the thieves stole the electric wire in the middle of Robegen Road and Hongqiao Road, all users in the area were blocked from making calls. The local police arrested a suspect, but the other person stole 90 feet, including 101 inches, of electric wire. This is the second theft in recent days. According to telephone company officials, repairs are now underway and can be restored that evening.

### Certification Rules for Overseas Chinese Industrial Products Promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs

After the Shanghai National Products Production and Sales Association, the Chinese Manufacturers Association and other groups telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to issue certificates for overseas Chinese industrial products, the original text of the certification rules promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs is as follows: Article 1: Any industry manufactured by overseas Chinese with good quality, and whose factories meet the following standards, may apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for a certificate of overseas Chinese industrial products: (1) Established with overseas Chinese capital, or using foreign capital, not exceeding one-half of the capital amount, and not attached with conditions that hinder operating rights; (2) Operated by overseas Chinese and having actual management rights and operating rights. The factories mentioned in the preceding paragraph, which use foreign capital or foreign raw materials, shall limit the workers in wartime to those who do not belong to Japan.

### Coolidge Ship: Sailing to Little Luzon

Originally Intended to Come to Shanghai, Temporary Change

The President Coolidge of the American President Lines, originally scheduled to sail from the United States to the Far East and arrive in Shanghai this Saturday (the 7th) before proceeding to Hong Kong and Little Luzon, the company announced yesterday that the ship had arrived in Kobe and would sail directly from Kobe to Little Luzon today. The ship will return from Little Luzon, passing through Hong Kong and Shanghai before returning to the United States. The reason for the temporary change in the itinerary of the ship, which originally sailed from the United States and did not come to Shanghai, but detoured directly to Little Luzon via Kobe, is not clear to the Shanghai office. The President Creford, originally scheduled to return from Little Luzon to Shanghai and the United States, was also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 7th of this month. It is now postponed and is expected to arrive on the 9th and leave Shanghai on the 10th, returning to Los Angeles.

### London Evacuates Japanese Nationals: Passing Through Shanghai on the Kamakura Maru

The ship is scheduled to sail back to Japan today.

### Donations for Poor Children's Winter Clothing

More Than 10,000 Yuan Has Been Received, Various Elementary Schools Enthusiastically Contribute

The Shanghai Office of the China Children's Relief Association has received more than 10,000 yuan in donations and sold more than 500 new cotton-padded clothes since soliciting donations for winter clothing for poor children in the city. In addition to stepping up fundraising from all parties, the association is currently planning to rush to produce 2,000 sets of winter clothes first (the association's fundraising goal is 10,000 sets of winter clothes, each set costing six yuan). Once the donations reach a considerable amount, it will immediately invite merchants to undertake the production. It is hoped that all sectors will contribute as soon as possible so that poor children can get cotton clothes as soon as possible to survive the severe winter. Since the city's schools responded to the association's sponsored winter clothing campaign for refugee children, the students of various schools, under the leadership of teachers, have been able to actively promote and enthusiastically donate in the spirit of "children saving children," with excellent results, which is quite commendable. The association has received donations and clothing from Shengxin, Quanzhang, Jianming, Shangxintang, Huimin, Peiren, Shixue, Huanan, Wuben, Qingnian, Sino-Western First, Second, and other elementary schools, and the Baptist Joint Middle School. Other schools are still continuing to promote it.

### Russian Constable Dies in the Line of Duty: Funeral and Burial Yesterday

On the 30th of last month, a robbery occurred on Avenue Edward VII. Russian constable No. 160 Xu Lianuof was seriously injured and died after exchanging gunfire with robbers. The funeral was held at 2:30 p.m. yesterday, departing from the morgue of Guangci Hospital and buried in Xujiahui Cemetery at 3:00 p.m. During the funeral, a Russian police officer led ten armed Russian constables to escort the coffin. French Police Chief Faber and Captain Adamovich of the Russian Police Team presided over the funeral. Representatives from various police stations and agencies attended. Many people sent wreaths. The deceased was 40 years old, unmarried, and had been serving in the French police station since 1937.

### Telephone Price Increase: Reconsideration Almost Impossible, The Company Will Implement it from the Day After Tomorrow, The Public Works Department Did Not Hold a Board Meeting Yesterday

Heavy burden, public sentiment is agitated, and the authorities are asked to reconsider and correct it. However, according to reporters' inquiries to relevant parties, the Public Works Department did not hold a board meeting yesterday. It is learned that reconsideration is almost impossible. Therefore, the new telephone price list will be implemented from the day after tomorrow (7th). A person in charge of a certain public group lamented that Shanghai citizens are facing high price pressures and have reached a serious stage. Speculation and manipulation by merchants is rampant, and public utilities are also frequently increasing prices. Alas, we ordinary people have no room to breathe. This is contrary to the purpose of maintaining public peace. Since telephones are relied upon by all industries, it is certainly impossible to dismantle them and not use them. All we can do is save by installing unnecessary telephones and not making unnecessary calls in order to save something if possible.

### Female Servant Turns Evil: Plots to Kill Mistress and Flee, Woman Stabbed to Death by Horse, Too Horrific to Behold, Stolen Valuable Clothing and Passbooks, etc.

Wang Shen, a woman from Zhenhai, 46 years old, lived at No. 6 Avenue Petain, French Concession. Her husband had passed away, leaving behind a large amount of assets. She had a son named Zhaoyi, 25 years old, who worked at Hosin Trust Company at No. 119 Renji Road. He was married last year. Because Mrs. Wang was stubborn, disputes often arose between the mother and son. Her son rented a separate residence at No. 9, Lane 698, Route Paul Henry. Mrs. Wang's residence was a single-family shikumen, a landlord herself, living alone on one floor. The third floor was rented to a Cantonese woman, Chen Zhou. Mrs. Wang was

Eccentric in Nature

Therefore, the female servants she hired often did not stay long. Recently, she hired a female servant from Jiangbei, Cui Agui. Her husband was a coolie who wiped cars for a certain car company and often visited her. The morning before yesterday (the 3rd), Mrs. Wang ordered Agui to go to the market to buy a chicken, which cost four yuan. After Mrs. Wang brought the chicken back, she complained that the price of the chicken was too high. The master and servant started arguing, but soon calmed down. Chen, the tenant living on the third floor, did not see Mrs. Wang the next day at noon, and the female servant Agui was also

Nowhere to Be Found

The door was tightly closed. She thought that Mrs. Wang had gone out to visit relatives or shop and had not returned. Until dusk, there was no movement. Suspicion arose, so she peeped through the keyhole, but saw nothing. Chen opened the door and saw that the bed had been moved, and she found a huge cotton bag under the bed, tied with ropes. After untying it, she discovered in horror

Mrs. Wang's Corpse

Lying there, wearing a cheongsam, with bare legs and feet, covered in six or seven horse wounds, and a horse stabbed into her neck, blood was dripping, too horrific to behold. She immediately reported it to the French police station, and then notified her son Zhaoyi to come, and then noticed that two gray back coats, a sea tiger velvet coat, a steel ring, and a bank passbook in the cabinet were all missing. It is learned that the husband of the female servant Agui had

Visited the Residence Once

The female servant was introduced by the female servant of No. 3's family. Then, police officers arrived and investigated everything, and brought all relevant persons, such as the three tenants, Chen, and the female servant of No. 3, to the police station for strict investigation, and at the same time investigated and arrested the fleeing female servant Agui and her husband. The body was sent to the autopsy room on Route Delastre.

### Slot Machine King: Hiding Without a Trace, Trial Opened Yesterday, Failed to Appear in Court, Confiscated Bail and Wanted

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the US Consular Court in China opened a trial this afternoon (the 4th) against Lai Ailai, the Shanghai Slot Machine King, for operating illegal gambling. US Consul Herrmick heard the testimony to prove that Lai Ailai was a US citizen. Unexpectedly, Lai Ailai had not appeared in court by 2:30 p.m. The Consul ordered Lai to be called three times, but no one answered, so he announced the confiscation of Lai's bail of 25,000 yuan and ordered the arrest of Lai. Lai Ailai admitted to the crime of operating illegal gambling during the previous trial, but the court must prove that he is a US citizen before a verdict can be made.

### Young Wu Xingfa Kidnapped Yesterday Morning; Father is Supervisor at Hotel Gramont; French Police Currently Trying to Rescue Him

Wu Xingfa, from Wuxing, a sixteen-year-old youth, was kidnapped without a trace yesterday morning. His father, Wu Changlin (over sixty years old), from Hubei, is a supervisor at the Hotel Gramont on Route Lafayette and Rue Pichon in the French Concession, which is opened by Gramont, a French citizen who is a deputy general manager at the French Municipal Council. Wu Changlin is in charge of errands and store departures and lives at 7 Lane, Route Ratard, Latour Estate. At 5:10 AM yesterday morning, Xingfa took his private car No. 321 to the Ximo Road vegetable market to buy vegetables. Unexpectedly, when the car passed the entrance of No. 1325 Rue Lafayette and Rue Pichon, two kidnappers were stationed by the roadside, and two others in long robes stood in front of No. 1360, where a Xiang Sheng taxi, number unknown, was pre-parked. Seeing Wu's car approaching, the four bandits rushed up, drew their guns, and forbade anyone from shouting. They forcibly dragged Xingfa out of the car, forced him into the taxi, and sped away without a trace. Afterwards, the driver rushed back home and reported the kidnapping of his young master. Subsequently, the family went to the local Route Say Zoong police station to request an investigation. Police officers went to the scene to investigate and took a driver to the station for strict investigation. The whereabouts of the kidnapped hostage, Wu Xingfa, are still unknown. The French police are currently trying to rescue him.

### Enemy Encounters on a Narrow Road, Suffers Two Axe Blows; Su Shaowen Severely Wounded in the Head

Su Shaowen, a 33-year-old man from Pudong, lives at No. 7 Xuejiazhai, Daxilu. Unexpectedly, at around 7:30 PM last night, he encountered an enemy on Columbia Road. Without a word, the enemy drew an axe and struck his head twice, causing profuse bleeding. The assailant, seeing his goal achieved, fled quickly. Afterwards, a street patrol car escorted him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

### Summary of Robberies

In a makeshift shed without a number on Xiaoshadu Road, Yaoshui Lane, three robbers suddenly broke in at around 5:00 AM yesterday morning. Two of the robbers were armed with guns, forbidding anyone from making noise. They robbed a Shandong native of several items and two to three hundred yuan in national currency before fleeing.

At No. 32, Hedefang, Hede Road, West Shanghai, ten robbers suddenly entered at 6:30 AM yesterday morning, armed with five guns. They surrounded the people on the spot and robbed them of one to five hundred yuan in legal tender. After the victims shouted loudly, the bandits, fearing exposure, fled with the loot. The victims then reported the incident to the police station for investigation and arrest.

### Two Construction Companies Dispute Over Purchase and Sale of Japanese Goods; Each Presented Their Case Yesterday, Court Ordered Judgment

Yi Changtai Hong Construction Company owner Tong Zhihe, residing at No. 44 Tongchunfang, Baike Road, Public Concession, not only engages in construction business but also promotes Japanese cement for Japanese parties, profiting handsomely. Kang Zhaoji, owner of Yu Shengkang Ji Construction Company at No. 505 Henan Road, learned that Black Brand Japanese cement was inexpensive. Therefore, on October 16th and 22nd of this year, he ordered

Japanese cement

of 4,000 bags from Yi Changtai Hong Construction Company, at 9.6 yuan per bag, and paid a deposit of 11,600 yuan. Later, Yi Changtai Hong Construction Company failed to deliver the goods within the agreed period. Kang Zhaoji, owner of Yu Shengkang Ji Construction Company, recently hired lawyer Ma Shouhua to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court's Civil Division, requesting the court to order defendant Tong Zhihe, owner of Yi Changhong Construction Company, to return the deposit of 11,800 yuan and to order the defendant to

Compensate for Losses

estimated at 11,000 yuan in national currency. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Lu Dejun in the Civil Division of the First Court. Both parties commissioned lawyers to appear in court. First, the plaintiff's attorney stated the subject matter of the lawsuit and the defendant's breach of contract. Then, Zhang Yuji, the attorney representing defendant Tong Zhihe, stated that the defendant was engaged in the business of opening Yi Changtai Construction Company and that the plaintiff and defendant were in the same industry. During these extraordinary times, purchasing cement was

Relatively Difficult

The plaintiff knew that the defendant had access to buying Japanese cement, so he entrusted the defendant to buy it for him. Unexpectedly, after the contract was signed, the cement

Was Controlled by the Japanese Military

resulting in non-delivery. The plaintiff delivered a Korean Bank check for 9,000 yuan, which has not yet been used. The plaintiff wants to return the military funds and can come and take them at any time but is unwilling to bear the responsibility for compensating for losses. After reviewing the evidence and hearing the arguments of both parties, the court announced the conclusion of the hearing and scheduled the verdict for December 13th.

### "Illness"

— Ning Jing

Now, whenever I hear that a young friend is sick, I can't help but doubt its authenticity. At the same time, a picture often seems to float before my eyes. There is a shadow flickering with bushy hair, big, bright eyes, and dark skin. I can also almost hear his low, urgent voice, resonating powerfully. The matter of his "illness" naturally surges into my heart, and it also naturally strengthens my belief: "China is saved; she has young people like this."

He is Xumin, short, a little fat, innocent, and enthusiastic. Once, he crashed his bicycle into a wall, and he screamed like a child. We laughed, and he blushed slightly and walked away. Not long after, we heard his loud, heroic singing again. When he was eager to get an answer, he would grab my shoulders, shake them gently, his eyes warming me, very seriously, "Tell me? Tell me?" urging me. But when he was unhappy or pondering, he became surprisingly quiet, like a secluded poet struggling with his verses, and in his round, big eyes, there seemed to be a light of melancholy.

Two years ago, we were classmates, but soon he transferred to another school, and our meetings gradually became less frequent. His home was far from my residence, and I had only been there once. The tall iron gates seemed out of proportion to the simplicity of his usual attire. When I pressed the doorbell, a dog barked, a small hole opened in the door, and an eye peered out. After inquiring, the doorman called inside, "Tell the young master, a friend has come." Then he ran out and warmly welcomed me in, but looking at the situation, I couldn't help but feel restrained. Thus, because there was nothing important, I didn't go there again later.

One afternoon last autumn, I ran into his younger brother, carrying his schoolbag, walking with some classmates. I called him over, wanting to get some news about his brother from him, but only heard the sentence:

"Him? He's been sick for two or three days." Before I could ask further, he ran off to catch up with his classmates. So I decided to visit him.

The next day before dusk, I went. After inquiring again, a maid led me to his door. Pushing open the door, I saw him staring at the ceiling in contemplation. Hearing the door creak, he turned and looked, then excitedly called out:

"Ha! Is that you? How did you come?" He sat up at the same time.

"Came to see you!" I replied. "Well! Talk while lying down, don't sit up." I glanced at him, beginning to have some doubts. His complexion was still the same, and because of his excitement, there was even some red showing through the darkness, his eyes shining, although his hair was disheveled, I couldn't see any traces of him being sick for two or three days.

But he smiled, instructed me to close the door, and then, like a child hiding in the woodshed telling a story, began to speak in a cautious and happy tone:

"You'll be surprised, I'm faking illness!"

"What?" I couldn't quite believe my ears.

He didn't care about me and continued, his face becoming very serious.

"I'm going to leave Shanghai, go to the rear. I don't want to stay here any longer!..." The door opened, and a maid brought in a cup of tea, placed it next to me, and said to him:

"Madam told you not to sit up, you'll catch a cold; talk less too." He casually replied and watched the maid leave, sighing to me:

"Mother is so good to me!..." But he didn't let the sadness of parting in his heart expand, so he changed the subject, "A lot of friends are leaving the day after tomorrow, and I've decided to go with them. The day before yesterday, I tested my parents' intentions, but they didn't approve and instead started guarding me closely. I have no choice but to fake illness. I'm sure I'll steal a chance to escape the day after tomorrow."

"For two days, I've only eaten porridge, and I'm really hungry." He smiled bitterly. "Actually, they would know as soon as they take my temperature, but they hired a Chinese medicine doctor, and that muddlehead even prescribed a prescription, haha!" It was getting late, and darkness invaded this small room. The exquisite furniture in the room stood vaguely, as if silently mourning the departure of its young master. And his voice was low and steady, waving in the air.

"Ning! Can you send a letter for me?" he asked me.

From beginning to end, I listened to him in silence, completely moved and intoxicated by him. Only at this moment did I wake up. I nodded, not responding, a thousand thoughts in my mind, very complex. I turned on the light for him, handed him paper and pen, and he immediately wrote the letter, sealed it, and handed it to me.

"Give it to Zhenzhi, that tall, thin guy with glasses... you may have seen him, please be sure to tell Zhenzhi that I will definitely come the day after tomorrow, he must wait for me." Then we shook hands tightly, his eyes glittering as if tears were about to flow out.

"Xumin, goodbye! Write letters in the future!" These were my last words.

Two days later, I went to his house again. The whole family was already in a mess. His younger brother saw me and immediately told me that he had left. Early in the morning, while the doorman took the dog out, he secretly left with a small suitcase. The door was still closed, and they still thought he was sleepless at night and wanted to sleep in a little longer in the morning. It was not until nine or ten o'clock that they discovered it and rushed to the dock, but the ship had already left. I didn't wait to hear the end before running back, my blood boiling.

After that, whenever a friend got sick, I couldn't help but suspect that they had the same illness as Xumin. I immediately rushed to their house, because this might also be my last meeting with them.

The Case of Hawthorne

### The Final Destination of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 12: Report and Explanation

I once said to him: "Our country is in a time of crisis, and future misfortunes can happen at any time and cannot be avoided. Young people are the lifeblood of the country and the pillars of the nation. How can you abandon yourself and throw yourself into the charming den, doing this act of suicide?" Hawthorne's words were of course more tactful, not as straightforward as mine. Yu Gantang looked ashamed and humiliated. I was secretly pleased, expecting that this young man still had the possibility of self-renewal, and the country could retain a bit more vitality. Because if a person feels ashamed of their mistakes, it shows that their sense of shame has not been completely extinguished. My hope for his self-renewal is pinned on this point.

When Hawthorne said goodbye to Ni Yushou, he had told him a few words about the wording in the newspaper. He truly left some room for Zhao Boxiong and would not drag his name into it, and Yu Gantang was also written as Yu Mou. Even the names I am recording now are fabricated. The names of several other people have also been changed.

We returned to our residence at 11:00 PM that night. The next day, Li Shouqi came to Shanghai, was interrogated by Ni Jinshou, and confirmed Hawthorne's speculation about Li Zhifan's motives. However, he definitely knew nothing about his father's murderous plan. Since this case was settled, Hawthorne did not advocate further involvement. Apart from recovering the four thousand five hundred and sixty yuan remitted by mail, Li Shouqi received no punishment at all. Regarding the property of the dancing queen, Li Shouqi of course dared not demand to inherit it. Lu Jiansheng did make a request to recover it. Hawthorne had tried his best to oppose it, and in the end, it, along with the reward he had given Hawthorne, was donated to charity.

Jiang Anna came to thank Hawthorne. Hawthorne refused her reward and gave her a few words of advice. She had a considerable realization due to the unfortunate end of her companion. The raincoat man in the black car was never found. Also, Lilans good friend, Bao Yumei, never fulfilled her promise. She never went to Lilans house. Whether Zhao Boxiong found her, we also did not know. However, after this case was disclosed, this Miss Bao Yumei suddenly left the dance floor and disappeared from then on. (186) (The End)

### About "The Story of Edison"

— Xin Ying

Following "Young Tom Edison," "Edison, the Man" will soon be released at the Dahua Theater. Here's a brief overview of MGM's production of this film:

Story Content

"Edison, the Man"'s screenplay is based on a story by Tauries Carlyle and Hugo Butler, and unlike "Young Tom Edison," which depicted Edison's childhood, "Edison, the Man" depicts Edison's adult efforts to study science and invent various items, succeeding as a great inventor and being respected by the world.

Production Process

On this year's production schedule, MGM had already decided to film Edison's history into two films: "Young Tom Edison" and "Edison, the Man." So, at the beginning of the year, both films were started simultaneously. Although the production time was not very long, the research work was quite complete, and many shots were filmed in Edison's laboratory.

Cast

"Young Tom Edison" stars Mickey Rooney, and "Edison, the Man" stars Spencer Tracy. They are ideal roles. The female lead is played by Hedy Lamarr. One is a outstanding male star, and one is a famous and beautiful female star. Their joint performance in "Edison, the Man" naturally has extraordinary results. Other supporting roles include Rita Johnson, Lynne Overman, Charles Coburn, Gene Lockhart, Henry Travers, and more than ten others, all of whom are famous stars.

Photography Problems

"Edison, the Man" is directed by Clarence Brown, produced by John Considine Jr., and the photography is handled by the famous photographer Harold Rosson. According to this photographer afterwards, Hedy Lamarr's beauty was particularly successful when filmed. However, when filming in the laboratory, 90% of the shots used gas lamps, and the laboratory ceiling was only ten feet high, making it impossible for the camera to utilize angles, which became the biggest problem. It is difficult to achieve good results without someone with expertise in photography!

### "Confucius" Screening Imminent

The Minhua Film Company's first contribution, "Confucius," directed by Fei Mu, has been rumored to be screened at the Grand Theater or the Dahua Theater. Minhua has been preparing for the filming of this film for more than a year, refining it through many trials, taking it seriously, and spending as much as 200,000 yuan. It is willing to release it in domestic theaters. The contract with the Jincheng Theater was signed the other night (1st), allowing it to be screened around Christmas. The Jincheng Theater has obtained this blockbuster film. In order to show its importance, in addition to renovating the entire theater from now on, it will also close for two days before the screening to meet the audience with a brand new look at that time. The audience has been eager for "Confucius" for a long time. Those who have watched the film's preview have praised it, and with the screening imminent, everyone is waiting with anticipation.

### Guolian Contract Expires; Bai Hong Joins Jin Xing; To Star in "Song of Shanghai"

— Jia Ying

After starring in "Fairy of the World," Bai Hong leapt from the music scene to become a film artist. Her acting skills have improved even more in recent years. Not long ago, someone said that she was going to leave Shanghai. As a result, the facts shattered the conspiracy of the slanderers. Recently, her contract with Guolian expired, and her future actions have attracted much attention from all parties.

The reporter met her yesterday at the Xin Xin Company's New Market to buy things. For the convenience of the conversation, she was taken to the dining department attached to the New Market for a brief conversation.

She said that her contract with Guolian expired on November 15th. Recently, various companies have contacted her several times, but after several considerations, she formally accepted Jin Xing's invitation and signed the contract yesterday afternoon.

After joining Jin Xing, Bai Hong's first film will probably be "Song of Shanghai."

### Portraits of Female Artists

— Tang Su

Bai Yuyan

In recent times, the "fighting skills" of female warrior actors have been popular on stage. Among those who are good at "fighting skills," Song Dezhu and Yan Shishan from Beijing are considered to be equally outstanding. In Shanghai, there are simply no male warrior actors who are famous for "fighting skills." However, Bai Yuyan, a female actor, emerged and was praised for "fighting skills" at the time, adding a lot of color to the red carpets in the south.

Bai Yuyan, nicknamed Lingdi, is originally from Hangzhou but grew up in Shanghai. She is nineteen years old this year and is the daughter of Bai Shuan (backstage manager of the Qiankun Grand Theater in the Great World). Bai Shuan comes from a professional acting school and is proficient in both literary and martial arts. Therefore, he taught everything in his mind to his daughter. Afterwards, he ordered Yuyan to practice martial arts with Guo Kunquan and practice moves with Shui Shangpiao (Wu Xikun's stage name), while "fighting skills" was taught by Hou Junqing. In addition, male actors Ge Huaqing, Zhao Qixia, Gu Yulan, and Li Qinxian, and female actors Bi Yuzhen, etc., have all spoken plays for Yuyan. Therefore, in addition to warrior plays, she also works as a Qingyi Huashan actor. The writer once watched her "Si Lang Visits His Mother" at the Xin Xin Stage, playing Princess Tie Jing. Her performance and singing were very good, but her fame is not due to "fighting skills." She is capable of everything that Song Dezhu and Yan Shishan have, and some of the techniques she is capable of are not available to Song and Yan. Even insiders unanimously admit that her moves are swift and steady, and can encompass the strengths of the Song and Yan schools. Looking around the Jiangnan opera scene, apart from Bai Yuyan, there is indeed no other female actor who can "fight skills" and compete with her.

Because of her proficiency in "fighting skills," when she joined the Gong Stage in early autumn, the Gong Stage specially arranged an armed Weaver Girl in "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" for her, adding a scene of eliminating demons so that she had the opportunity to show her strengths. The Weaver Girl in "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" performs large-scale fighting, which is unprecedented, and Bai Yuyan pioneered it. Now, the Gong Stage is rehearsing nine volumes of "Living Buddha Jigong," and she has a performance of playing four whips, which is full of highlights and greatly welcomed by the audience.

She is a Peking opera employee, but she is fond of spoken drama. She is very familiar with Tang Ruoqing, and she once said: "If I have the opportunity, I would really like to perform in a spoken drama!"

### Yi Hua Films "A Story of Laughter"

Recently, various film companies have gradually become enthusiastic about fashion films. After Zhang Henshui's "The Noble Families of Qinhuai" was filmed by Jin Xing, it was followed by Yi Hua Company's "A Story of Laughter." When Yi Hua was preparing to film this film, there was a strong intention to have Li Qinian play the lead role. After several meetings, it was finally decided to use Li Lihua. It is said that Li Lihua's performance of singing a large drum song in this film is very vivid. It is generally believed that Li Lihua will become even more popular due to the release of "A Story of Laughter." "A Story of Laughter" is a well-known masterpiece; and Li Lihua playing Shen Fengxi is no less than Zhang Henshui's ideal character.
