Editorial

### After Italy Enters the War

On the evening of the 10th, Italy, led by Prime Minister Mussolini, finally removed the veil of temporarily not participating in the war and declared war on Britain and France. This marks a major development in the second phase of the European war.

The general reason for Italy's participation in the war lies in its territorial and economic demands from Britain and France not being met. The immediate reason is that Britain and France implemented a strict blockade policy for the sake of the war, not allowing Italy any exceptions. The timing chosen for participating in the war is on the eve of the German army's continuous victories, approaching Paris. The key, as this newspaper has repeatedly stated, is the past ten months, when Italy was fawned upon by both belligerent parties, had the gentle persuasion of the Pope, and the earnest mediation of the American president. It held a pivotal position, grasping a freely manipulable mechanism, hesitant to decide, both close and distant. Italy during this period was truly unparalleled in honor, able to look down upon the masses. From a more practical, smaller perspective, in terms of material aspects, other countries were depleting their strength while Italy was able to reorganize its military and increase its importance. Other countries did not have time for economic construction, while Italy was able to stimulate all industries and rapidly achieve prosperity. Heaven-given, people-given, Italy enjoyed it alone. Unexpectedly, the so-called temporary non-participation in the war was only temporary for ten months, and it finally entered the war. Of course, current world opinion is not worth relying on, the judgment of future historians is not worth asking; victory or defeat is unknowable, good or bad fortune is unknowable, and the long-term gains and losses over a century are unknowable. However, the shift from temporary non-participation to abandoning the comfort of a peaceful life, entering the water and fire from now on, treating jade and silk as mere sandals, turning weapons of peace into weapons of war from now on - this is no longer a temporary issue.

What Mr. Mussolini considers unworthy of reliance, not worth asking, and what is unknowable to anyone else, we will temporarily reserve and not discuss. But what kind of impact will this shift in Mr. Mussolini's mind have on the current international situation, and what possible consequences will it bring about? We cannot help but try to anticipate.

Let's talk about the war itself: Italy's overall military strength cannot be compared with Germany in many ways. Not long ago, it helped General Franco engage in the revolution in Spain and achieved victory. Success was hard-won, far less straightforward than Germany's victories in Northern and Western Europe; this is a brand-new test, perhaps an effective exercise! But after Italy declared war on Britain and France, from the perspective of France, which bears the brunt, it cannot afford to underestimate any new enemy at a time of crisis. Being attacked on two fronts is like facing two Germanys. Moreover, at this time, a large part of the British Expeditionary Force has just returned to the country, and the second batch of the Expeditionary Force is said to have just set off. Therefore, in the short term, it is actually France confronting two powerful enemies. How will France overcome this difficulty until the war situation stabilizes? This is a burning issue common to both Britain and France. Even if Italy does not participate in the war, France cannot be completely unprepared militarily towards Italy, but what is most urgent, of course, is to increase defense as much as possible from the reserve army to the northern front to resist the German army's sharp edge and to engage in the defense of Paris. Now, however, it has no choice but to allocate all its military strength to both the south and north fronts. Assuming that the French army does not find it very difficult to deal with the Italian army, and even strikes back hard and achieves remarkable military success, the strength for operations against Germany is halved due to dispersion, which of course makes the difficulty of stabilizing the northern front and defending Paris doubled. It may even be necessary to make plans to abandon the capital early, which is also expected. A declaration of war is a full-scale war between the two sides, and not a local war, but offense and defense need not be the same and depends on strategy. Now we do not yet know whether Italy will launch an offensive in the colonies at the same time. If it is launched at the same time, then the African continent is another side of the war, the situation is chaotic, and in the Mediterranean, naval superiority belongs to Britain and France, so Italy will naturally have its serious encounters. Assuming that Italy does not take the offensive in Africa and the Mediterranean, Britain and France, out of military, political, and economic necessity, may also have the possibility of launching a pre-emptive strike. After the naval war is launched, with the absolute superiority of the British and French navies, the area from Gibraltar in the west to Aden and Djibouti in the east will inevitably remain in the hands of Britain and France. What is particularly worth watching is that Italy has the opportunity to conduct large-scale experiments with its air force, while Britain and France have the opportunity to greatly enhance their prestige through naval power.

But the development from now on is no longer a simple military issue; Italy's participation in the war has added an infinitely complex international political dimension to the overall situation. The reason is that as long as Italy does not participate in the war for one day, the "peace offensive" continues to exist. What its effect and significance are, and what its value is, is another question, but once Italy starts participating in the war, this possibility has completely disappeared. With reconciliation being hopeless, the United States, Spain, and the Balkan countries each have the need to immediately reconsider their attitudes. The general trend is irreversible, and these countries will probably be directly or indirectly, sooner or later, drawn into the whirlpool of the war. There is ample room for extreme changes in the division of international friends and enemies; if we observe from the common sense of international politics, Britain and France have more allies, while Germany and Italy have fewer. If we say that the momentum of Germany and Italy is at its peak at present, and that it will decline from now on, it is not impossible. Therefore, Germany and Italy's current strategy is to quickly defeat France and end the war on the continent first, so that international politics does not undergo any changes, or even if it does, it does not affect the success or failure of the war on the continent. For Britain and France, the first priority at present is to first save the declining situation in France, stabilize the war situation, and advance the war to a long-term state. The recent stage of the major defeats of the British and French armies is better explained by a strategic error than by asserting that their military strength is significantly different from that of Germany: The French commander was obsessed with the Maginot Line and neglected the enemy's attacks from other directions. If we consider the military strength of the two sides, although the final victory or defeat is unknowable, a stalemate for a considerable period is indeed possible. They are bound to fight fiercely for a long time, and today's outsiders may not be able to quietly observe from the sidelines for a long time!

### The US Decides to Accelerate the Use of Special Resources to Assist Britain and France in Resisting Violence; Roosevelt Expresses Regret Over the Failure of Mediation; Accuses Italy of Stabbing Its Neighbor in the Back with a Sharp Knife

Charlottesville, Virginia President Roosevelt stated yesterday in a speech at the University of Virginia that the United States, both the government and the public, feel particular anxiety and seriousness about Italy's decision to join the war. The American republics express sympathy for the countries that sacrifice their lives and blood to fight against the gods of force and hatred. At present, we will simultaneously follow two clear paths: using our country's material resources to assist those who resist force, and at the same time, adjusting and accelerating the utilization of these resources, so that our people in the Americas may have the equipment and training to cope with any emergency. All means to achieve these two goals must clear all obstacles. All current signs and signals call on us to move forward at full speed. President Roosevelt appealed to the American people to meet the difficulties of the times with effort, courage, sacrifice, and sincerity. He also spoke of how the US government tried to dissuade Italy from entering the war, saying that he had proposed that if Italy did not join the war, he would request that the countries concerned provide guarantees for the faithful implementation of any agreement on the various adjustments that Italy desired. Unfortunately, Mussolini was unwilling to accept this proposal. He also stated that the US government was willing to cooperate with the Italian government at an appropriate time to create a more stable world order by reducing armaments and building a freer international economic system. However, Italy, in order to maintain its so-called "freedom of action" and fulfill its promise to Germany, disregarded the rights and safety of other countries and the lives of countless people directly threatened by the expansion of the war, and indicated that it was unwilling to attempt to achieve its wishes by peaceful means.

According to the first part of President Roosevelt's speech, he made the following satire to the isolationist elements, saying that some people still hold the currently obviously mistaken concept that the United States can allow its country to become an isolated island in a world controlled by this philosophy of force. This kind of isolated island may become the dream of those who still speak and vote in the name of isolationists. In his eyes and in the eyes of the majority of Americans today, this isolated island is no more than a helpless nightmare for a people who have lost their freedom, are handcuffed, are in prison, and need to be fed daily through iron windows by rude and unmerciful masters from other continents to relieve their hunger. At present, we urgently need to ask ourselves how we can prevent the creation of this prison and save ourselves from being placed in it. (Reuters, 11th)

President Roosevelt inserted a comment on his own, criticizing Italy for stabbing France in the back with a dagger, while giving a speech today at the University of Virginia on the section where he mentioned Italy's decision to enter the war. He stated, "On June 10, 1940, the one who held the dagger has stabbed the neighbor in the back." (Havas, 10th)

Rome Mussolini declared yesterday afternoon on the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia that Italy's declaration of war had been delivered to the Allied countries and had been notified to the British and French ambassadors in Italy. He then said that the plutocratic democracies of the West often prevented the advancement of the Italian people. Italy had tried its best to contain this mad war, and we have now resolved to confront the dangers and sacrifices of war. We have resolved to fight in the continental and marine borders where our people are now being suffocated. I solemnly declare that Italy does not want to trap other people in this battle on land or at sea. I have told Berlin that the Italian people have a friend and are willing to march in step with this friend.

After Mussolini explained that this was a decision that could not be changed, he declared, "We are declaring war on the plutocratic and reactionary democracies of the West, who are hindering the progress of the Italian people and even threatening the survival of the Italian people from time to time. The most recent facts in history can be summarized in three words: hesitation and half-rejection, frequent threats, and extortion. Our conscience is absolutely at peace. The whole world and you have witnessed that Italy has done its best in humanity to avoid the mad sweep of Europe, but all efforts have been in vain. It would have been enough if the democracies could revise the treaties to suit the essential needs of the lives of all countries and not regard them as something that could never be touched. It would have been enough not to insist on a guarantee policy, which has proven to be fatal to those who accept it. It would have been enough not to reject the proposal put forward by the German head of state when the war in Poland ended last October." After Mussolini mentioned that the Italian people were taking up arms to resolve the issue of their maritime boundaries, he added, "We now want to break the chains of iron that shackle Italy's land and military at sea, because forty-five million people, if they cannot freely communicate with the sea, are not truly free. Now the die is cast. Of our own volition, we have burned the bridges behind us. I solemnly declare that Italy does not want to forcibly drag other people who are Italy's neighbors on land and sea into this battle. Switzerland, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Egypt, and Greece should all pay attention to this statement."

On the eve of the occurrence of this historic event, we are embracing the Italian King with sincere hearts and we are also paying tribute to the head of the allied country, Greater Germany (the crowd cheers for Hitler). Laborious and fascist Italy now stands firm for the third time, heroic and united. Italy has never been so before.

Mussolini concluded by saying, "We must win, and finally obtain a just and long-term peace for Italy, Europe, and the whole world."

After Mussolini finished speaking, the crowd cheered wildly. Prior to the speech, a radio station reporter declared that 80 million Germans would listen to the Prime Minister's speech, and that we should pay tribute to them, as we have 150 million people standing united. The report estimated that about 250,000 people had gathered in front of the Palazzo Venezia. They carried giant banners with the names of the places claimed by Italy written on them. All shops were closed and employees were listening during Mussolini's speech. The loudspeakers set up in various squares, restaurants, and cafes broadcast fascist songs and marches before Mussolini began his speech. After the crowd paid their respects to Mussolini in front of the Palazzo Venezia, they flocked to the Royal Palace, shouting "Long live the Italian King!" (Reuters, 11th)

### American Neutrality Law Applies to Italy

Washington After Italy declared war on Britain and France, Roosevelt signed three orders last night, extending the American Neutrality Act to Italy. One declared that the United States would strictly adhere to neutrality towards the new belligerent nations. The second declared that Italy had entered a state of belligerency with Britain and France. Therefore, the various provisions of the American Neutrality Act should immediately apply to Italy. The third provided detailed measures on how the ships of the belligerent nations should use American ports and territorial waters. (Havas, 11th)

Washington Secretary of State Hull said that Italy's participation in the war would greatly disappoint people everywhere and is a human tragedy. (Reuters, 10th)

Some units have crossed the river, but they have encountered fierce resistance everywhere. The enemy has sent aircraft to bomb our rear, attempting to disrupt our movements, but without success. (2) West of the Oise River, in the Soissons area, enemy units attacked the Ourcq Canal this morning between the towns of La Fert√©-Milon and La Fert√©-en-Tardenois. Simultaneously, another unit attacked the city of Fismes from the Ardre River valley, but both attacks failed. (3) In the Champagne area, the enemy launched a two-pronged attack on our forces at dawn today at the town of Rethel. Newly arrived reinforcements, under the cover of tanks and bombers, also participated in the operation. As a result, they only advanced as far as two bridgeheads on the upper Aisne River, which we had lost and regained. (4) East of the Aisne River, from the city of Attigny, the enemy intensified its attacks in the Argonne area north of the communication lines from Beaumont to the Meuse River. Our forces resolutely resisted the enemy wherever they encountered them, adopting a steady and reliable strategy, holding every inch of ground, and launching counterattacks at any time. (5) Our aircraft continued to fly to the front lines and the enemy's rear, such as Namur in Belgium, to conduct reconnaissance. They also bombed enemy units in F√®re-Champenoise, Soissons, and Bondel, with fighter escorts. They repeatedly engaged enemy aircraft and achieved significant victories.

### German Aircraft Squadrons Again Heavily Bomb Paris; Large Fires in Parts of the Paris Area

New York ‚Äì NBC, at 9:10 AM today (Shanghai summer time, 10:10 PM Tuesday), reported directly from London that waves of German aircraft are flowing into the French capital, dropping countless heavy bombs and incendiary bombs. Large fires have broken out in parts of Paris. As the flames light up the sky, German aircraft are still bombing the city. (United Press dispatch, 11th)

Incendiary bombs dropped by German aircraft have ignited fires in areas near Paris. The bridges along the Seine River are no longer clearly visible. One cannot clearly see people across the Place de la Concorde. On Sunday night, the suburbs of Paris were heavily bombed by German aircraft, especially the railway terminals. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

German Forces Head Straight for Paris in Two Directions; French Premier Inspects the Front Lines

Tours ‚Äì As German tanks and motorized units charge into the Allied lines from the east and west, attempting to reach Paris, the Allied forces, further stimulated by Italy's entry into the war, are fighting with even greater determination today, striving to stem the German advance on all fronts. French Premier Reynaud personally visited the war zone today to inspect the troops and encourage the Allied forces to fight to the end. The fighting today is intensifying. Although German casualties are heavy, they are still attacking the French defense lines in all sectors. According to French military dispatches, German tank units are charging fiercely into the northwest area of Paris in an endless stream. German infantry are advancing towards Paris from the west. German mechanized and motorized units are frequently increasing pressure on the Allied lines along the Qu√©quy-Les-√âtaples and Frelles-en-Th√©nies lines, attempting to enter Paris from the east. Military observers point out that the German forces are currently engaging in flanking maneuvers from the east and west, with the aim of encircling the large forests that form the northern screen of Paris and occupying the city. French officials believe that Hitler has indeed driven all his remaining forces onto the battlefield to intensify his attack, attempting to destroy the Allied defenses in one fell swoop. The French High Command ordered this morning that special measures be taken to stop German motorized units from entering Paris from the west. From the coast to the Aisne River, the French army has launched a fierce counter-offensive to prevent the Germans from establishing positions on the left bank of the Seine River. Although the situation is extremely critical, Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand declared today that he believes the Allies will regain their strength and defeat the advancing German forces. Military experts believe that based on the countless equipment and manpower of both the Allied and German forces, the current war can be described as a battle unprecedented in history. The German maneuvers from the northwest and west are actually a copy of the Schlieffen Plan. French military authorities have rapidly transformed Paris into a heavily fortified battlefield today, for defensive purposes. The main roads are equipped with tank barriers. Other roads are also equipped with tanks and artillery positions to hinder the attackers' progress. On the French-German border, every village and town has been transformed into a fortress. The enemy will have to suffer heavy losses before crossing these villages and towns and entering Paris. The evacuation of Paris residents continued unabated last night and this morning. Trains, cars, bicycles, and airplanes were all carrying people away from this danger zone. The gold and bills of Paris banks have also been moved to various places, leaving only staff to handle business during this emergency. (United Press dispatch, 11th)

Milan ‚Äì According to newspaper reports, German tank units have appeared in the suburbs of Paris, about 50 kilometers from the front line. The newspapers claim that French civilians are continuing to take refuge everywhere amidst constant air raids. (United Press dispatch, 11th)

Paris Declared in a State of Defense; French Government to Move to Tours

Fierce battles have also taken place between Reims and the Argonne, where our forces have been quite successful. The enemy's numbers are also large, and their resistance is gradually weakening. Our bombers again flew to the port of Le Havre to bomb it. The sluice gates have been destroyed by our aircraft, sinking one destroyer, damaging one destroyer and two transport ships (10,000 tons each), and cutting off several bridges on the Meuse and lower Oise Rivers, greatly hindering the enemy's retreat. Yesterday, the Allied forces lost a total of 29 aircraft, while our forces lost 8 aircraft. (Haitong dispatch, 11th)

### British Admiralty Declares Loss of Five Ships

This afternoon, the Royal Air Force also bombed German armored vehicles and heavy vehicle columns from an altitude of 1,000 feet south of Boves (20 kilometers southwest of Amiens). Within fifteen minutes, 2,000 bombs of various types were dropped. Many enemy vehicles were destroyed, and six artillery pieces were hit by large bombs. Another enemy mechanized unit, west of Boves, was about to enter the forest when it was bombed with incendiary bombs by our squadrons. Various vehicles and trees were set on fire." (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Soviet Newspapers Analyze the Situation in France

Moscow ‚Äì Soviet newspaper military observers believe that the decisive battle for Paris is now imminent. The military observer of Izvestia stated, "Clearly, the German high command is attempting to find weaknesses in the French defensive lines and deliver the main blows. On the other hand, they are also paying attention to the weakness of the French reserve forces. They hope that the French authorities will distribute the reserve forces along the entire line, so that the Allied forces will be unable to launch a fierce counter-offensive." The military observer of Pravda stated, "The German offensive is fierce, and the French resistance is extremely strong, because both sides are aware that this is a matter of life and death.

### The Main Force of the Japanese Army in Western Hubei Is Trapped in Desperate Situation Under Chinese Pressure; China Is Launching a Full-Scale General Attack; More Than 6,000 Japanese Soldiers Have Been Annihilated Successively; Japanese Reinforcements Are Continuously Arriving, and the Crossings Are Still Being Repeatedly Contested

Yichang ‚Äì The Japanese forces facing Dangyang and Yichang have received substantial reinforcements since yesterday afternoon, constantly struggling within China's layered and vast encirclement lines. The battle situation is becoming more intense. The details are as follows: 1. South of the Hanyi Road, from Ban Yue Mountain through Anfu Temple to Baiyangyiqian on the north bank of the Yangtze River, the Japanese forces in this area are most active in using the method of advancing by drilling gaps along the north bank of the Yangtze River, but they are also receiving the most fierce attacks from the Chinese army. Since noon on the 10th, the Japanese have attempted to use large-scale air force cover for their attacks. The Chinese army has used the terrain for aerial concealment, and has also used extremely vast deployments to resist the Japanese step by step. By last night, the Japanese army had suffered about 3,600 casualties, and the offensive was frustrated again. Only a few Japanese soldiers sought gaps to break through, but they were annihilated by the Chinese forces. Most of the Japanese did not dare to advance rashly. This morning, bloody battles resumed, and the Japanese situation was in decline. The Chinese army has strengthened its air defense, and the Japanese aircraft did not dare to fly low. By noon, the battle situation had entered a stalemate. 2. On the main front of the Hanyi Road, the Japanese have been heavily damaged and are unable to advance further. The Chinese army has implemented a main force attack with flexible tactics. From yesterday afternoon to this afternoon, the Chinese army has continuously charged and killed more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers, and the Japanese situation is extremely shaky. 3. North of Dangyang, most of the Japanese forces were driven into the mountains between Dangyang and Yuanan by the Chinese army yesterday morning and are trapped in a disintegrated state. The Chinese army in all directions is not giving the Japanese any chance to catch their breath and is continuing to implement the planned plan, that is, to advance fiercely from the north, east, south three sides of Wuan Mountain to the top of the mountain. The Japanese have repeatedly attempted to break out, but have failed. By yesterday afternoon, Wuan Mountain and the surrounding highlands of Qilin Mountain, Huangmao Ridge, and Wangcheng Mountain to the northwest were all in Chinese hands. By late evening, the remaining Japanese soldiers were finally pressed into the deep and narrow river valley area in the upper reaches of the Jushui River and are now firmly locked by the Chinese in the valley near Yuanan. It is found that this force is the main force of the Japanese army, and it has now been put in a desperate situation and is on the verge of extinction. As a result, the Japanese army on the entire line is extremely panicked, and the doom of total collapse and annihilation is imminent. In summary, since the 10th, the fierce battle lasting day and night has successively annihilated more than 6,000 Japanese soldiers. Seeing that the good opportunity has arrived, the Chinese officers and soldiers are ten thousand times more courageous and have now launched a full-scale general attack, which is progressing fiercely. (Dispatch, 11th)

Yichang ‚Äì The Japanese forces on the west bank of the Xiang River have been divided and cut off by the Chinese army using ingenious tactics, and countless Japanese soldiers have been killed. As for the more than 2,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry near Liujiaji South Gejia River (northwest of Jingmen), the Chinese army first captured all their mules, horses, and supplies, and then went to attack them from both sides. After a fierce battle for a day and night, more than 700 Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining Japanese soldiers broke through and fled. The Japanese forces occupying the key point of Kongjiawan on the Xiangsha Road were surrounded and severely attacked by the Chinese army on the morning of the 9th, and all more than 300 people were annihilated. At this moment, the Chinese army is launching a fierce attack on the Japanese according to the planned plan. (Dispatch, 11th)

Xiangyang ‚Äì Since the 8th, the Chinese army on the west bank of the lower reaches of the Xiang River has continued to capture the crossings, repeatedly contending for them, giving the Japanese a very big blow. In order to keep the alive route for the more than 60,000 Japanese on the west bank, the Japanese army in Hankou rushed urgently up the river to reinforce with a large number of naval vessels and marines. In order to achieve the goal of annihilating the Japanese, the Chinese army, in accordance with the planned deployment, is fighting more and more bravely. On the 9th and 10th, bloody battles occurred everywhere on the front of about 200 li on the west side of the Xiang River. Although several batches of the Japanese army's large reinforcements sought gaps to commit crimes in the west, their supplies have been captured by the Chinese, and more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers have been killed in two days. (Dispatch, 21st)

Hankou ‚Äì According to Japanese sources, the Japanese army divided into three routes to attack Yichang, engaged in fierce battles southwest of Shayang. Two Japanese routes attacked Jingmen from both sides, and the purpose was obviously to take the road through Dangyang and spy on Yichang. The Japanese army on the southern route has crossed the Han River near Shayang, and the Chinese army is threatening the rear of the Japanese army. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

The letter stated: "In recent days, the Japanese military has disregarded humanitarian justice and dispatched large numbers of aircraft day and night to indiscriminately bomb the undefended people and cultural and charitable organizations in the capital of China. Even the embassies of various countries have not been spared, especially the deliberate destruction of your esteemed embassy. Even under the solemn flag of your esteemed nation, they recklessly dropped bombs like rain, targeting your embassy. As a result, your ambassador has unfortunately suffered from the trampling of Japanese aircraft. This behavior of the Japanese military fully demonstrates that friendly nations sympathizing with our country are also among their enemies. Upon hearing this news, this association shares a deep sense of indignation. On behalf of the Chinese people, we extend our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to your ambassador and all embassy staff. We hope you will understand." (11th)

Details of Yesterday's Air Raid on Chongqing

Chongqing. Yesterday afternoon, Japanese planes attacked Chongqing in three waves. The first wave appeared at 12:25 PM, dropping multiple bombs on the outskirts of the city along the Chongqing-Chengdu Highway, failing to hit their targets, only destroying some thatched sheds and small houses. The number of casualties is unknown. The second wave of 27 Japanese planes appeared at 1:20 PM, intruding into the airspace over the western district of the city, dropping heavy bombs from an altitude of 9,000 feet, bombing residential areas, and destroying several houses. The French Embassy and the Chongqing Hotel were also severely shaken. Several bombs fell only 40 yards from the French Embassy, and several others fell near the Chongqing Hotel, which is where foreign guests stay, only a few feet away. Fortunately, they did not explode, and only two small bombs exploded upon impact. The shrapnel penetrated the walls of the hotel, causing slight damage to the interior furnishings, but all the guests and staff in the hotel took refuge in air raid shelters and were not injured. The remaining bombs fell in rice paddies, causing minimal damage. The third wave of Japanese planes appeared at 1:40 PM, coming from the Jialing River and entering the urban area. The extent of the damage is unknown. The air raid alarm in Chongqing was lifted at 2:40 PM. Afterwards, rumors circulated that the city's power plant had been destroyed, which was denied by the authorities of the plant, who stated that although several power lines in the city had been bombed and destroyed, it would not affect the city's power supply, as the rate of construction in the city was no less than the rate of destruction by the Japanese. After the alarm was lifted, the authorities investigated and found that two Japanese planes had been shot down in the suburbs by Chinese fighter planes. Although the air raid was severe, the residents of the city had learned from the experience of the bombing on May 28 and took shelter appropriately, so the casualties were minimal. Yesterday's air raid coincided with the Dragon Boat Festival. Afterwards, the dragon boat races on the Jialing River proceeded as usual, with thousands of spectators on both banks, still cheerful and spirited, not caring about the air raid an hour earlier. From this, one can see the spirit of the people. (Havas, 11th)

Chongqing. Chongqing was heavily bombed again yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM by 70 Japanese planes. Their target was government agencies outside Tongqing City. However, because the buildings were scattered, although many bombs were dropped, the damage was minimal. Several bombs fell near the German Embassy, causing all the glass windows to shatter. Multiple bombs also fell 20 meters from the Hai Tung News Agency, damaging doors and windows, but fortunately, there were no casualties. Foreign observers believe that the material impact of the Japanese planes bombing Chongqing from 800 kilometers away on such a large scale, aside from psychological impact, is rather small. (Hai Tung News Agency, 11th)

### British Foreign Office Issues Common Declaration in Response to Italian Prime Minister's Speech: Italy's Provocation is a Reckless Act, the Consequences Should Be Borne by Mussolini Alone

London. The British Foreign Office issued the following declaration after Italy notified them of its declaration of war against Britain, France at one minute past midnight last night: "The British people are not surprised by Mussolini's hasty and reckless decision. Mussolini's decision to join the German side has been evident for weeks. The opposition of the majority of Italians to this move is equally obvious to all. Mussolini's decision is based on the most ample material reasons, his motivation is purely driven by the seizure of benefits. Therefore, he chose to join the war at the height of the German aggression against the Allied countries. Mussolini hoped to profit from his erroneous judgment that Germany would win a great victory. The British and French governments have made it clear to Mussolini in recent weeks that if Italy considers there to be any dissatisfaction with its position in the Mediterranean, they are fully prepared to engage in friendly discussions. The only reason for Italy's entry into the war is probably that Mussolini believes that by driving his people into a terrible war, he will gain more. In Mussolini's speech, he first mentioned recent incidents, which are said to be summarized as follows: 'Half-promises, frequent threats, engaging in intimidation, and finally the alliance of encirclement of fifty-two countries.' When Mussolini made this statement, he seemed to forget to mention the agreement signed between Britain and Italy on April 16, 1938. In that agreement, the Italian government stated that all outstanding issues between the two countries had been resolved, the status quo of the Mediterranean had been recognized, and a mechanism for resolving any future disputes had been prepared. This agreement is concrete proof that the British government and people have never wanted to wage war with Italy, believing that there are no major points of conflict between each other that cannot be resolved by peaceful means. The Allied governments have repeatedly stated their willingness to implement this agreement freely signed by Italy and to discuss any opinions between each other. Mussolini now intends to tear up this agreement and plunge his country into war. Therefore, the responsibility for the disasters caused by this war to Italy in the future will be borne by Mussolini alone. From the Unos made by Mussolini not to attack the countries he designated, the people of the world can judge to what extent his policies are purely mechanical and without hesitation. The solemn promises made today will be as unrepentant as when he invaded Denmark and Norway under the official non-aggression promises he considered applicable. Therefore, any country seems to consider any guarantees made in Mussolini's speech tonight to be worthless." (Reuters, 11th)

### Anti-Italian Demonstrations in Various Parts of Britain, Large Numbers of Italian Residents Arrested

### Two Italian Ships Scuttled Themselves

London. Yesterday, the crew of the Italian ship "Capo Noli" (3,921 tons), which sailed from Montreal, set fire to themselves in the St. Lawrence River today to avoid being captured. According to the Canadian Ministry of Defense, this attempt by the Italian ship has been prevented by a Canadian minesweeper, which caught up with it 180 miles east of Quebec and captured it. However, two other Italian ships have scuttled themselves today. One is the 6,000-ton cargo ship "Silena," whose crew scuttled themselves in the Bay of Algeciras last night after hearing Mussolini's radio speech. The other is the "New Bivoria," which scuttled itself outside Gibraltar. However, according to Lloyd's Register of World Ships, there is no ship named "New Bivoria." There is only a 5,000-ton ship named "New Media." (Reuters, 11th)

### Shanghai Concessions Remain Neutral After Italy Enters War, Allied Defense Forces Agree to Jointly Maintain Status Quo, French Concession Does Not Discriminate Against Italian Residents

Since Italy declared war on Britain and France at 6:00 PM the night before last (that is, 3:00 PM Shanghai time), the situation in the city suddenly became tense, as the British and Italian defense forces have formed a confrontational situation in the defense zones of the concessions. However, in order to maintain local security and avoid conflicts between subordinates of both sides when they meet in coffee shops and other public places, the senior authorities of the British and Italian defense forces have issued orders prohibiting their troops from going out. At the same time, the commanders of the defense forces of various countries are also planning that personnel of enemy troops can only visit or move around in designated places. Italian troops are absolutely not allowed to enter the French Concession. It is reported that Commander Park of the U.S. Marine Corps met with the commanders of the defense forces of various countries yesterday morning, including the commanders of the British, French, and Italian defense forces. The French commander and the Italian Marine Corps commander also met yesterday morning after receiving the news of Italy's entry into the war. They agreed to maintain the status quo of the concessions with all their strength. Subsequently, the Italian commander also held talks with Japanese army personnel at the Italian Consulate on Chengdu Road. The discussion also focused on the issue of maintaining the status of the concessions.

### U.S. Will Do Its Best to Maintain the Status Quo

Yesterday, U.S. officials in this port expressed their personal views on the situation in the Shanghai concessions after Italy entered the war and the defense force issues of Britain, France, and Italy, saying that the U.S. hopes that the British and French defense forces and the Italian defense force in this port will take peaceful measures and jointly maintain security. The U.S. has rights and interests in Shanghai and will do its best to protect them, cooperate with the defense forces of various countries, and maintain the status quo of the concessions. The Maclane team of the U.S. Marine Corps in the British defense zone in the Public Concession along Jing'an Temple Road and Xinzha Road has slightly strengthened its guard since yesterday morning and has dispatched its patrol teams to patrol its defense zone. It is also learned that the U.S. naval authorities in Shanghai have announced that the naval personnel will not be granted leave of absence and will wait for further orders. At the same time, the U.S. naval authorities are also taking measures to maintain security, which cannot be made public at this time.

### British People Not Allowed to Trade with Italy

The British Embassy in China in this port has issued a notice restricting all British merchants and people of British descent from trading with Italian merchants, otherwise, they will be punished under the law of trading with the enemy. This is the reaction to Italy's entry into the war in this port. Also, Italian residents who have deposits in British and French banks and French residents who have deposits in Chinese-Italian banks, fearing confiscation, rushed to withdraw their deposits at the management methods, causing the banks to be very busy yesterday. Later, when the residents of the respective countries learned that nothing unexpected had happened, they were all relieved.

British and Italian Defense Zones Not Separated for the Time Being

According to a reporter from the U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters, in order to maintain peace between the hostile armies, special steps are currently being considered. The method is the same as for Chinese Memorial Day. The patrol forces will be increased, and the defense work will be strengthened. However, the U.S. Marine Corps does not intend to send teams to separate the British, Italian, and Shanghai defense zones. Anyone entering the French Concession to visit family members can go directly to their destination, but they cannot visit the streets. It is reported that yesterday afternoon, several sailors were detained by the patrol teams.

British, French, German, and Italian Forces in Shanghai

Military circles believe that rumors of Germany's seizing the concessions are inaccurate. It is said that there are only 220 Italian soldiers stationed in Shanghai, and all their armaments are small and cannot confront the French army. The German side can only concentrate 800 people who have received military training. The French army has a strength of about 2,000 people. The British army has 1,600 people. The U.S. Marine Corps also has no less than 1,600 people. It is said that the defense forces of various countries have agreed to cooperate to maintain the order of the concessions so that the Japanese army cannot use the "unexpected event" as an excuse to enter the concessions. The navies of Britain, France, and Italy currently have warships anchored in the Huangpu River, with three gunboats from the British side and two each from the French and Italian sides. In addition, during the war, the Italian ship Contifordian will remain in Shanghai, while four other Italian ships have sailed to the sealing line in Nanshi to take refuge for the time being. An Italian ship will arrive here from Ningbo tomorrow and will also sail to the Nanshi sealing line and will not resume navigation for the time being.

French Concession Does Not Discriminate Against German Residents

O'Keeffe, the acting Consul General of France in Shanghai, told Chinese and foreign journalists in this port yesterday morning that Italian residents residing in the French Concession who do not engage in political activities will still be allowed to reside in the French Concession. The method is the same as the French Concession's treatment of German residents and will be protected in the same way as other residents. Also, Italian residents in the French Concession yesterday did not receive any notice from the French Concession authorities to move out. There are approximately 600 Italian residents in this port, most of whom live in the French Concession. According to responsible British figures in this port, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has lost his ability to take the initiative, and his foreign policy has been hijacked by Hitler. He has placed Italy under the control of the Nazis. According to the opinions of the British residents, after Italy entered the war, it was completely under the control of the Germans, which is the same as the situation in Italy fifty years ago.

### Japan's Stance on Concessions: No Rash Actions
### Though Covetous, the Situation Prevents It; America Vigilantly Monitors Japanese Actions

According to a Westerner familiar with Far Eastern affairs, the Japanese side is indeed quite covetous of the concessions. However, before it alters its policy of "not joining the European war," it will likely not take violent actions to seize the concessions. Whether it will ultimately not join the European war is difficult to say, but not until America loses its ability to be a stabilizing factor in the Pacific will Japan act hastily and bring disaster upon itself. Currently, America's actions to aid Britain and France are becoming increasingly active, and even joining the European war is not entirely impossible. However, we should know that even if America joins the European war, its power in the Pacific will not be diminished. This is because the British and French navies already view Germany and Italy as being at an absolute advantage, and the weakness of their armies lies not in a lack of soldiers, but in insufficient ammunition. America only needs to provide sufficient supplies of airplanes, artillery, and tanks, and to assist with transportation using some of its ships, which is already sufficient. Even if military assistance is unavoidable, those sent to help will mostly be from the army and air force, while the navy will still be able to monitor Japan and maintain control of the Pacific sea lanes, preventing Japan from being trapped by blockades if it participates in the war.

Japanese national strength has been consumed to a considerable extent, as the country's policymakers must know. Considering the American pressure that joining the European war would inevitably bring, they may feel that the future is extremely dangerous and be cautious in their actions. However, this does not mean that Japan will never take risks and further escalate the war, and that the Shanghai concessions are completely safe. Wealthy Chinese people should still think ahead and take precautions, moving inland and investing in various businesses to ensure the safety of their funds.

Italian Official Residence Specially Protected: The French Consul-General, Mr. Auchy, reiterated that rumors of the French Concession authorities ordering all Italian residents in the district to leave the country were completely untrue. He stated that the French Concession authorities were responsible for protecting the safety of the Italian ambassador and other officials, and denied that the French Concession authorities had ordered the Italian flag to be taken down from the Italian ambassador's residence at 118 Kim Shenfu Road yesterday morning. Furthermore, the French Concession authorities dispatched a large number of police officers yesterday morning to guard the Italian ambassador's residence, to prevent any unforeseen events from occurring. However, several Italian military vehicles were parked in front of the Italian ambassador's residence yesterday morning, moving items.

The Italian Consulate is Under Strict Guard: Yesterday, the Italian Consulate at 269 Chengdu Road in this city saw unusually frequent comings and goings of people, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. Two Italian soldiers stood guard at the entrance of the consulate, closely watching those entering and leaving, and questioning them very strictly. Armed personnel were also patrolling inside the consulate. A foreign reporter asked Mr. Tai, a secretary at the Italian consulate, about the Italian government's policy regarding the European war.

He said that during this critical period, he regretted that he could not answer. It is true that the Italian Ambassador, Mr. Gagliani, and his staff have suspended their trip to North China to escape the summer heat, and that Mr. Gastra Pon Lo has recently come to Shanghai to inspect the local diplomatic affairs. However, he would remain silent on other matters and would not express any opinions.

The Conte Verde to Move Anchorage Today: The Italian mail steamer Conte Verde, which was ordered by the Italian government to remain in a neutral port and suspend its return to Europe, was still docked at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf yesterday. Yesterday, it began unloading the goods that had already been loaded and were prepared to be shipped to Hong Kong. These goods weighed about 100 tons. It is expected that it will be moved to a different anchorage today. According to company staff, if buoys number one and two are not available, it will be moved to buoys number thirteen and fourteen. If it cannot be berthed there for an extended period, it will be moved to Wusong, depending on the circumstances at the time.

Italian Merchant Ships Continue to Sail: With Italy's official entry into the war, the future voyages of the Italian merchant ships operating in China have become a matter of great concern. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday at various Italian merchant shipping companies, none of the companies had received any orders from the Italian consulate as of yesterday. The ships of the Sino-Italian Company, with the exception of the Deping, which is currently in Zhenhai, are all undergoing annual repairs in shipyards. The Changde of the Rocchi Shipping Company recently returned to Shanghai from Ningbo and is temporarily suspending a voyage due to boiler cleaning. The Shili of the Italian-China Shipping Company is expected to arrive in Shanghai from Wenzhou tomorrow. The company said that it has not yet decided when it will resume sailing. There are also several other Italian ships chartered by merchants to operate to North China and Wenzhou, and they are all prepared to continue sailing according to their original schedules.

### Japan Barefacedly Seeks Peace
### But Still Acts Arrogantly; In Reality, Peace is Not Difficult; Japan Only Needs to Withdraw All Troops from China

Since the Japanese army invaded China three years ago, they have achieved nothing despite their aging troops and demoralized soldiers. Realizing that they cannot conquer China by force, and having no face to show to their own people, they are spreading peace rumors in desperation, hoping to ease the minds of their people. As a result, rumors are flying in the market, claiming that either the British and French ambassadors have urged the Chinese government to negotiate peace, or that the Chinese government has entrusted the German ambassador to mediate. However, all of these claims have been solemnly denied by relevant parties, and dismissed as baseless. According to foreign reports yesterday, a spokesman for the Japanese ambassador stated at a press conference that Japan does indeed wish to make peace with China, but denied spreading peace rumors. According to the spokesman, Japan's desired conditions for peace with China are that the military and the National Government cooperate with a certain party. However, when the Chinese side stated that there can be peace only if the Japanese army withdraws completely from China, the spokesman considered it "laughable." This is because, according to the spokesman, Japan still considers itself to be the victor.

### Rice Prices Rise Again:
### Orders Placed for Tribute Rice; Quantity Approximately 50,000 Bags

In view of the rising rice prices, the fact that the early rice crop will not be harvested for some time, and the severe drought plaguing rice-producing areas in the country, various rice merchants in the city believe that if they do not promptly seek to increase rice reserves, they will be manipulated again, which would affect the livelihoods of ordinary people and the security of the entire concession. Therefore, in order to prepare for the worst, they have agreed to entrust foreign companies such as Defu (French), Heyi (British), and Fujia (Swiss) to telegraph Saigon and order a large quantity of tribute rice for storage. The quantity is said to be approximately 50,000 bags. All sectors of the city hope that the concession authorities will strictly set standard market prices, and that the Shanghai Rice Price Stabilization Committee will handle the sale of tribute rice at stable prices as soon as possible.

### US Cruiser Marblehead

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, the US Asiatic Fleet cruiser Marblehead arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 11th) from Manila, mooring at the US naval buoy, replacing the US flagship Augusta, which left Shanghai yesterday (the 10th). Admiral Hepburn, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, departed on the Augusta yesterday, and Admiral Hepburn's personal yacht, Issaquah, also sailed with the Augusta. It is said that the Marblehead will remain in Shanghai for the summer and will not follow the usual practice of sailing to North China this summer.

### Gold Falls;
### Black Market Exchange Rate Loosens; Prices of All Commodities to Plunge

Yesterday, the financial market in this city was also affected by speculation about Italy's war situation, causing the price of cash gold to plummet by 380 yuan, closing at 5,180 yuan. The black market exchange rates for British and American currency also eased sharply, with the British exchange rate breaking the four-pence mark to 4.01875 pence, and the American exchange rate also breaking the six-yuan mark to 6.01875 yuan. American dollar bills even plummeted to 16.05 yuan, once falling to 16 yuan and then to 15.9 yuan. Commodity prices in the city also fell sharply as a result. Coal ball prices fell from 142 yuan per ton to 134 yuan, and the price per dan also fell from 7.7 yuan to 7.2 yuan. However, some coal merchants are still trying to raise prices, so some are selling at 7.4 yuan, and the market price is not uniform. It is said that prices will continue to fall today. The price of white newsprint has also fallen to 36 yuan per ream. According to those familiar with the commercial situation, the prices of all commodities are likely to continue to plunge.

### Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai Receives Telegram from London:
### Norway's National Policy Remains Unchanged: Will Assist Allied Forces in Other Ways

After the news that General Fleischer, commander of the Norwegian Sixth Army, had signed an armistice agreement with Germany, and that the Norwegian King had ordered the Norwegian army to cease resistance on Norwegian soil, the Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai received a telegram from the Norwegian Embassy in London yesterday afternoon, confirming that the Norwegian army in the heavily guarded areas had ceased military resistance against the German army. King Haakon VI and important members of the Norwegian government have now retreated from northern cities to Britain with the Allied forces. The telegram also announced that Norway's established policy will not change and that it will continue to assist the Allied forces in other ways. The Norwegian government has also been reorganized and established within British territory. Furthermore, a spokesperson for the consulate stated that this armistice was purely to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and was not a surrender.

### Dutch East Indies
### Confiscates German Assets
### Several German Ships and Cargoes Seized; Extremely Strict to Prevent Fifth Column Activities

According to the North China Daily News, Mr. Xu, a foreigner, recently returned to Shanghai from Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. According to him, the Dutch East Indies authorities took swift action to prevent possible riots by the German "Fifth Column." After receiving news of German residents in the Netherlands, the police immediately took action to arrest all German merchants and those suspected of sympathizing with the German side, including members of the Dutch Fascist movement. German assets and investments, as well as real estate worth 40 million Dutch guilders, were all confiscated. Several German ships anchored in the Dutch East Indies, along with their cargoes worth 300 million Dutch guilders, were also seized. It is estimated that the losses suffered by Germans in the archipelago will exceed 500 million Dutch guilders. After the Netherlands surrendered, the residents of the Dutch East Indies worked very hard, with some working in shifts day and night. When Mr. Xu was in Batavia, he met a sailor who had seized a German ship in the port. The sailor said that the German crew had attempted to scuttle three German ships but failed. It was later discovered that the German crew had planned to scuttle the ships as soon as the Dutch authorities seized them, but they did not have time to carry out the plan. The oil, tin, and rubber on board were all confiscated, and the ships were repainted and used to transport supplies for the Allied forces. The indigenous residents of the Dutch East Indies have all expressed their loyalty to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. The entire policy of the archipelago's government is not only aimed at benefiting the Netherlands, but also at benefiting the whole world, so it gives equal rights and opportunities to all countries.

### Foreign Rice Arrives in Ningbo
### Japan Still Prevents Shipment
### Famine Victims in Shanxi Call for Help

The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai held a fundraising conference to relieve the famine in their hometown, and the first result was very satisfactory, with donations and subscriptions totaling more than 1.08 million yuan. The association has scheduled a second fundraising conference for 5 pm on the 22nd, aiming to raise another 2 million yuan. According to a telegram received by the association from Ningbo, the Ningbo Food Supply and Marketing Company, in view of the shortage of food rice in Ningbo and the depletion of food rice in various parts of Taiwan, has specially sent representatives to Shanghai to jointly purchase foreign rice from Hong Kong and Saigon. The first batch of rice from Hong Kong has already been transported to Zhenhai by the Grand Wheel, totaling more than 18,000 bags. The second batch of about 10,000 stones will arrive in Ningbo around the 20th, and the third batch of 40,000 stones will arrive by the end of the month. In order to restrict purchases, the Food Relief Association will start selling rice from 6 am every day from the 11th, limiting each person to one dou at a price of 5 cents per dou, and has designated the following rice shops to sell: Jiangdong Muxing Lane Dashun Rice Mill, Xinpu Street Shang Lao Yuxing Rice Shop, Jiangbei An Waitan Xinhuo Rice Shop, Xianning Street Chen Wanshun Rice Shop, Dongdu Road Qianyi Rice Shop, Xida Zha Wufengxiang Rice Shop, Sanbanqiao Lane Donghoumao Rice Shop, and Beida Road Zhaokang Rice Shop. However, purchases of food rice by the military government's charitable organizations will be specially subsidized by the Yin County government.

Ruital to Set Sail: The Ruital, a direct line passenger ship of the Huaxun Shipping Company on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, arrived at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou on the morning of the 10th and loaded 2,000 bags of Zhen Rice for shipment to Ningbo for relief. It was unreasonably obstructed by the Japanese naval military police. After the company's manager tried his best to communicate with the Japanese side, he was unable to get results until noon. The ship then returned to the wharf at 14 Beijing Road and set sail for Ningbo at 6 pm yesterday after loading passengers.

Famine Victims Appeal: The Shanghai Shanxi Guild Hall yesterday issued an urgent appeal: "The population of the old Shanyin and Kuaiji counties in Shaoxing totals 1.2 million. Since the 813 Incident, they have only relied on rice relief from Shangrao in Jiangxi and Jinhua. Since Xiaoshan in eastern Zhejiang fell, the army has been stationed, and the demand for food rice has increased. However, the rice purchased by merchants cannot be transported to Shaoxing for relief due to control and transportation vehicle issues. The price has soared from 40-50 yuan to 70-80 yuan per stone, and now it has skyrocketed to 117 yuan. The authorities are simply searching villagers for 10-20 stones of food rice, confiscating it, arresting people, and imposing fines. They have no plan to relieve the famine, and they are only harassing the people. Without fundamental solutions, the situation is dire. Recently, Shanghai newspapers reported on the Shaoxing natives in Shanghai transporting rice for relief, which refers to Yuyao and Shangyu counties. The Shaoxing County of Shanyin and Kuaiji is still in dire straits and in urgent need of relief."

### Taikoo Dockyard Labor Strike Resolved:
### Company Further Increases Wages to Two Yuan Per Worker

The stevedores of the British Taikoo Dockyard went on strike last week after their demand for a wage increase was unsuccessful. The strike has lasted for six days. Although the foreman and worker representatives have been negotiating constantly, the company insisted on the terms of the February 10 agreement, while the workers refused to work for anything less than two yuan per worker. Both sides were at extreme ends, and a solution could not be found for a time. Various media outlets have reported on this. Since the workers went on strike, goods on various ships could not be loaded or unloaded, and they could not be exported. Ship schedules were delayed, and the company suffered considerable losses. As a result, the company's attitude suddenly changed yesterday morning.

The foreman was informed that the company would allow an 80% wage increase, with the foreman subsidizing the small difference. The foreman reluctantly agreed to the subsidy after being informed, and then convened a meeting of worker representatives. The workers expressed satisfaction with the acknowledgment of a two-yuan wage per worker. The foreman then ordered them to work, but the workers felt that the negotiations had been successful and held a victory rally in Pudong today to celebrate, and paraded at the Taikoo Wharf in Yangjiadu, Pudong. It was decided to resume work this morning.

The foreman and worker representatives also signed a new agreement yesterday to ensure good faith. The Jinan and Suzhou, which had arrived some days ago, returned to anchorage outside the Wusongkou to await the resolution of the labor strike. It is expected that the two ships can also enter the port today, dock at the wharf, and unload their cargo. A total of five ships belonging to the company arrived during this labor strike. In addition to the New Beijing, which came from abroad, the other four ships, Qiongzhou, Yingzhou, Jinan, and Suzhou, came to Shanghai from South China, carrying a large batch of foreign rice totaling more than 45,800 bags, which can be unloaded after work resumes.

### All Industries Pay National Taxes According to Law:
### Authorities Express Appreciation: Stamps Out of Stock; Hope for Prompt Shipment to Shanghai

Although Shanghai has become an isolated island, all industries are deeply aware of their responsibilities and continue to pay various taxes and levies according to law. The government authorities deeply appreciate this. In the past, such as with stamp tax, businesses have consistently affixed stamps after the withdrawal of the national army. Although they are temporarily out of stock recently, businesses are eagerly awaiting the early arrival of stamps in Shanghai, so that they can continue to affix them as usual and fulfill their national taxpaying responsibility, demonstrating their enthusiasm for national affairs. Recently, in order to reward patriotism and facilitate tax payments, the financial authorities have stipulated that all businesses and organizations in Shanghai can pay the taxes they owe in any part of the interior, and that branches should also pay in the interior, to ensure safety. It has been reported earlier that it is expected that all industries will be more enthusiastic about paying taxes with this convenience.

### Proprietors of Bailey Gauze Shop and Others:
### Forging Freight Waybills: Impersonating Shenxin Factory Products to Defraud: Arrested Together; Case is Very Complex

Wang Xianglin, a Ningbo native and proprietor of the Bailey Gauze Shop in Room 108, Harry Building, 233 Nanjing Road; Wang Zhengfu, manager; accomplices Wang Jianzhang and Zhang Desheng, a local who formerly served as a Chinese detective in the Public Concession; and Ningbo native Dai Xianfang and Shaoxing native Sun Xinian were arrested one after another by Chinese Chief Detective Yao Yuanlong, Detective Ni Jiafeng, and Western Detective Green of the Jing'an Temple Police Station for allegedly forging "Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Tax Bureau" freight waybills, impersonating Shenxin Power Factory products, and defrauding others through intimidation. Hundreds of genuine transportation documents were seized at the Bailey Gauze Shop, worth 4,039 yuan in legal tender, and 387 counterfeit transportation documents and four books, as well as four seals, were seized at Zhang Desheng's residence at 279 Hede Road and Sun Xinian's residence at 860 Beijing Road. Subsequently, detectives from the French Concession Police went to Wang's house at 13 Lane 189, West Zilaihuo Street, and seized a zinc plate for the counterfeit transportation documents and a "Unified Tax Bureau" seal, all of which were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Mr. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stood up and presented the case, stating that the case was reported by Feng Nanyi, a representative of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, who said that the factory's name was being used on silk cloth transportation documents, but the goods listed on the documents were not products of the factory, and it was actually a case of changing the appearance of the goods, which affected the factory's business. Based on the report, the police station cracked the case. It was found that Zhang Desheng, one of the defendants, was a former police officer who was arrested last year for committing a crime and sentenced to one year and six months in prison, with a four-year suspended sentence. Dai Xianfang and Sun Xinian were also sentenced to six months in prison, with a three-year suspended sentence. Because the case is complex, he requested permission for detention. Judge Liu approved a seven-day detention for further investigation.

### Conspiring to Embezzle Public Funds:
### Faking a Robbery Fails: Zhu Rongting, Yao Huachun, and Others Arrested

Zhu Rongting, a native of Suzhou, was employed as a clerk at Xie Xing Yuan Money Shop, 429 Jiujiang Road. On the 8th of this month, Zhu was ordered by the shop owner to withdraw 5,145 yuan from the Shanghai Bank and Dingkang Money Shop to purchase US dollar drafts at Fuyuan Money Shop in Ruyi Lane, Henan Road. However, Zhu had malicious intentions and colluded with Yao Huachun, Chen Xiangsheng, Li Yongde, and Li Shunnan, all natives of Suzhou. After withdrawing the money, Zhu deposited 2,000 yuan of it with Chen Qixiang, a clerk at Rongzhang Silk Shop, 18 Xiangfen Lane, while the remainder was distributed among Yao and others. However, to avoid being caught, Li and Chen pretended to be robbers and, together with Zhu, went to the entrance of Lane 10 near Sichuan Road, Ningbo Road, and staged a robbery. Zhu loudly called for the police, claiming that more than 5,000 yuan had been robbed. The police took Zhu to the Central Police Station to report the incident, and Chinese Detective Cheng Renkun investigated. Because the location and time Zhu mentioned were suspicious, he tried his best to investigate and exposed the fraud. Yao and the other four were arrested one after another in Room 602 of the Da Hu Hotel on Aiduya Road. At the time, Yao and the others were drinking beer and having fun with prostitutes in the room. They were taken back to the police station along with the 4,090 yuan of stolen goods. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested detention and asked for separate lawsuits after investigating the criminal responsibility of each defendant. Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned them and ordered them to be remanded in custody for another week for further questioning.

### Impersonating a Doctor for Fraud: Cao Qin Sentenced to One Year

Cao Qin (31 years old) from Anhui, on the afternoon of the 11th of last month, impersonated Tan Keming, a doctor from Jisheng Hospital at No. 306 Shanzhong Road. He went to the home of Yu Lan'ying, a woman from Hangzhou, at No. 75 Dongzilaihuo Street. He boasted that Yu was suffering from severe stomach and menstrual problems and that he could cure her instantly. Yu believed him and asked Cao to treat her. Cao wrote a prescription and ordered her to buy six small bottles of baking soda for 16 yuan in legal tender. Later, a neighbor discovered his deception and reported him to the police, who arrested Cao and sent him to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi argued that the defendant had impersonated a doctor and used deception to treat patients, causing untold harm, and that he was a repeat offender.

### Jiangsu Middle Schools in Shanghai Enrolling Transfer Students in the Third Grade: Joint Examinations Scheduled by Each School for Students Who Have Lost Their Schooling in Occupied Areas

Enrolling transfer students in the third grade of senior high school and the third grade of junior high school was rarely permitted under pre-war education regulations. After the war, due to special circumstances, some flexibility has been allowed. Last year, some schools enrolled transfer students in the third grades of senior and junior high school. However, there were often problems with students skipping grades during transfers between schools. It is heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Education Administration, in order to improve student levels and prevent abuses, has stipulated a joint examination method for senior and junior high school third-grade transfer students at Jiangsu Provincial middle schools resuming classes in Shanghai during the summer vacation. As a general principle, third-grade transfer students will not be accepted into the senior and junior high school classes of the 29th academic year. In order to assist students who have lost their schooling in occupied areas, or to fill minimum enrollment quotas, the qualifications for applying to senior and junior high school third-grade transfer classes at each school are that applicants must have completed the coursework for the second grade of senior or junior high school with passing grades, and have verifiable documentation, a resume, and a photograph. Only applicants who pass the review will be allowed to take the examination. Registration will be at each individual school, and the examinations will be held at a designated provincial school in two phases (the first time on July 22nd and 23rd, the second time on August 27th and 28th). The examination subjects for senior high school third grade are Civics, Chinese, English, Mathematics (Solid Geometry, Advanced Algebra, Trigonometry), Physics or Chemistry (chosen by the examinee), History and Geography. The examination subjects for junior high school third grade are Civics, Chinese, English, Arithmetic, Algebra, Physics or Chemistry (chosen by the examinee), History and Geography. Schools that enroll senior or junior high school third-grade students should jointly form a senior or junior high school joint admissions committee, with three people mutually selected as directors to oversee the examination.

### Baseball Fever in Hong Kong: Nanhua Loses to China, Result 8-3

(Hong Kong News) Baseball in Hong Kong is becoming increasingly popular. Recently, two teams played at Jiaoshui Stadium. Hong Kong Beer first defeated Engineering 14-1. Nanhua and China then took the stage. The entire Nanhua team made their debut yesterday, attracting attention from all sides.

In the first inning, Nanhua‚Äôs first batter, Ma Shiwei, and Ma Naiguang successively reached first base, followed by Shi Jiakuan and Bao Wenpei, each getting a hit to first base. The advance troops were so sharp, that the Chinese team's morale was thrown into disarray. Nanhua‚Äôs Ma, Shi, and Bao returned to base one after another, scoring three runs. The Chinese team used all their strength to end the offensive by Ye Yeqing, Chen Guangye, and Xia Weibin.

When it was China's turn to attack, the umpire Zha Shi (from Min Diannu, second base) bore a grudge because the Min team was overwhelmed by the Hong Kong Club the other day, and Lin Ye was the umpire. So when Lin Ye was waiting for the ball, he repeatedly called "strike." Bao Wenpei took advantage of this and struck out Lin Ye with three strikes. Chen Lianliang and Chen Fangxuan were also dismissed, and the whole situation collapsed. China got nothing, and Nanhua led 3-0.

In the second inning, Nanhua made a big mistake. Four up and three down, they ended with zero points. When it was China's turn to counterattack, all the members did not dare to slacken, and did their best, scoring fifteen consecutive points before coming to a halt. Since then, Nanhua fell into a slump. By the fifth inning, both sides agreed to score based on the five innings. China won 18-3.

### Finance The Impact of Italy's Entry into the War: Foreign Exchange Sellers Arrive in Succession

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announce its rates at 9:30 AM. The British pound remained stable, while the US dollar was pegged at a tight 25. Other currencies, such as the Japanese yen and German mark, also experienced a slight weakening. Regarding the domestic market, the news of Italy's declaration of war in Europe caused widespread unease, leading to a surge in selling. Throughout the day, in addition to aggressive selling by Chinese speculators, Hong Kong's Lei Hing and Japan's Bank, as well as the Yu Lee Bank, were all keen to sell. Consequently, the morning saw the British pound fall to 4 pence, with the US dollar initially reaching 6.0625 yuan and further weakening to 6.25 yuan in later trading. Before the evening close, rumors of tension in Paris circulated, prompting market participants to adopt a wait-and-see approach to buying and selling, resulting in extreme market volatility. Ultimately, the British pound closed at 4 pence 0.0625, and the US dollar closed at 6.1875 yuan, showing an increase of 2.1875 for the British pound and a decrease of 3.4375 for the US dollar compared to before the holiday. The futures market mirrored the weakness in the spot market.

Market Sentiment Is Uneasy

The morning began with the London Telegraph's reporting of a near-term drop of 37.5 and a far-term rise of 1.875. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London raw materials were stable. Exchange rates showed no change for the British pound against the US dollar, a decrease of 0.0625 against Shanghai, no change against the French franc, a decrease of 3 cents for the US dollar against the British pound, a decrease of 5.5 cents against Shanghai, and a small decrease of 1.5 cents against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened the spot selling prices in the morning, with the British pound at 3 pence 0.875 and the US dollar at 5.6875 yuan. Compared to before the holiday, the British pound saw a slight decrease of 0.03125, while the US dollar experienced a sharp increase of 1.5625, primarily due to the significant drop in exchange rates. The market remained volatile after the opening, largely influenced by Italy's formal declaration of war in Europe, which weakened market sentiment. Chinese speculators were predominantly sellers, with little buying interest. Initially, foreign firms absorbed June US dollar contracts from 5.6875 yuan to 5.9375 yuan, showing a firm trend. Later, American banks and foreign firms settled spot US dollar transactions at 5.875 yuan. When the HSBC rates were announced, the British pound remained unchanged, while the US dollar was firm at 25. Subsequently, Hong Kong Telegraph also offered sales, but Chinese speculators continued to sell. Hong Kong Telegraph sold spot British pounds to HSBC at 4 pence, and foreign firms acquired June US dollar contracts from speculators at 6 yuan and 6.03125 yuan. Yu Lee Bank also sold June US dollar contracts to foreign firms at 6 yuan. As noon approached, Japanese banks and others offered sales, causing the market to weaken. June US dollar contracts reached a firm 6.0625 yuan, and Chinese speculators sold spot US dollars to American banks, consistently priced at 6.00625 yuan. As a result, the British pound closed at 4 pence 7.03125, and the US dollar closed at 6.0625 yuan. The June contracts were priced the same as the spot market, while the July contracts were priced at 3 pence 9.375 for the British pound and 5.90625 yuan for the US dollar, showing a decrease of 1.5625 for the British pound and an increase of 3.75 for the US dollar compared to the morning opening.

US Dollar Weakens to 6.115 Yuan

Selling pressure intensified in the afternoon. Initially, Wo sold June US dollar contracts to Sassoon at 6.125 yuan, which helped stabilize the market temporarily. However, speculators remained the primary sellers, offering June US dollar contracts at 6.1875 yuan and selling spot US dollars as low as 6.25 yuan. Ultimately, the market stabilized at the close, with the spot British pound at 4 pence 0.0625 and the US dollar at 6.1875 yuan. The June contracts were priced the same as the spot market, while the July contracts were priced at 3 pence 9.6875 for the British pound and 6 yuan for the US dollar, showing an increase of 2.1875 for both spot and futures British pound and a decrease of 3.4375 for the spot and June US dollar contracts and an increase of 3.125 for the July US dollar contract compared to before the holiday.

Hong Kong Exchange: Initially Tight, Then Retreats

### The European Situation Is Unspeakable; Gold Appears Dim and Colorless, Reaching a Low of 5,200 Yuan

Yesterday's cash gold spot market experienced a worsening downtrend, with a single-day decline that could be described as drastic. Although there were some fluctuations in the middle, it was difficult to maintain any upward momentum. The primary reason for this was the significant weakening of the foreign exchange market, driven by the ongoing developments in Europe and Italy's declaration of war. This situation instilled fear in market participants, who believed that long positions offered more losses than gains. Consequently, there was a growing desire to sell. The market opened relatively stable, slightly down by 50 yuan, opening at 5,600 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange houses bought in, causing a rebound of 50 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market continued to report tightening, buying interest faded, leading to a decline to 5,370 yuan. The noon close was only 5,380 yuan. The afternoon market opened weak. After a brief uplift, it plunged to a low of 5,200 yuan. At this time, it was rumored that securities firms were actively buying, and it was also rumored that German troops were approaching Paris. Although money exchange houses bought on the cheap before the close, there was only a rebound to 5,280 yuan (and even after the close, the market felt weak, with even a 30 yuan discount on the closing price still difficult to find buyers). This was a massive drop of 370 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. Total trading volume for the day was approximately 4,000 taels. Jewelry gold also experienced a sharp drop of 40 yuan, while customs gold remained unchanged.

Gold Drops by 370 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened steady, with a slight decrease of 50 yuan, driven by reports of Italy's entry into the war, but the black market US dollar tightened due to the sharp decline in the British pound. Gold shops traded 30 taels among themselves at 5,600 yuan. Subsequently, driven by aggressive buying by money exchange houses and silver shops, the price quickly rebounded by 50 yuan. Gold shops sold 20 taels to securities firms for 5,650 yuan. As the foreign exchange market weakened, selling pressure returned, and gold shops and silver shops rushed to sell, while there were very few buyers. Before long, there was a sharp drop of 200 yuan. Yu shops sold 20 taels to securities firms for 5,450 yuan. Later, with securities firms and money exchange houses buying in, the price rebounded by 70 yuan. Money exchange houses traded 30 taels with each other for 5,520 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market continued to tighten, sellers continued to arrive, causing the market to collapse again, plummeting by 150 yuan. Gold shops sold 50 taels to silver shops for 5,370 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange houses bought 10 taels from gold shops for 5,380 yuan, which served as the noon closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, market sentiment was even weaker, and the masses competed to sell. Silver shops sold 20 taels to securities firms for only 5,300 yuan. Later, securities firms and gold shops bought in, briefly seeing a rebound of 60 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels from gold shops for 5,360 yuan. However, with the foreign exchange market even weaker, and rumors spreading that German troops had reached the outskirts of Paris, sellers gathered. One securities firm aggressively sold, causing a rapid decline of 160 yuan. Gold shops sold 50 taels to silver shops for 5,200 yuan. Subsequently, selling pressure gradually subsided, and gold shops and money exchange houses aggressively bought on the cheap, resulting in a rebound of 150 yuan. Money exchange houses bought 30 taels from gold shops for 5,350 yuan. Later, silver shops and cash gold shops sold, causing another drop of 70 yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to gold shops for 5,280 yuan, which served as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell by 370 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. It has now fallen for three consecutive days, totaling 820 yuan. After the close, the price fell further to 5,260 yuan. Total fluctuations for the day were 450 yuan. Cash gold shops sold their branded gold at a price that was higher than the spot price by a dozen yuan, while they bought it back at a price that was lower by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and trading was scarce.

Jewelry Gold Drops Frequently by 40 Yuan

At the beginning, major jewelry shops were still listing jewelry gold at 580 yuan per tael. However, at 9:37 AM, it was lowered by 10 yuan. At 9:50 AM, it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At 10:15 AM, it rebounded by 10 yuan. At 11:25 AM, it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At 12:05 PM, it was lowered by another 10 yuan. At 2:30 PM, it was lowered by another ten. There were no further changes after this. As a result, it was lowered by a total of 40 yuan. The major jewelry shops revised their listing to 540 yuan, while the new jewelry shops had the same prices as the previous day. The buy-back price was lower by about 30 yuan.

### Italy Enters the War: Foreign Currencies Plunge

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a sharp decline, as Italy's declaration of war against the Allied nations led to significant changes in the European situation. This caused widespread panic, resulting in a sharp drop of over 300 yuan in spot gold prices. The supply of British and American gold sovereigns was plentiful, and market prices uniformly plunged by 10 yuan. The black market foreign exchange rate weakened significantly, with the British pound breaking through the 4 pence barrier and the US dollar rising above the 6 yuan mark. Selling pressure permeated the market for British and American gold notes, with American gold notes falling to a low of 15.9 yuan in the afternoon before slightly rebounding to 16 yuan in the evening, a sharp drop of 1.3 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. British gold notes closed at a low of 51 yuan. Hong Kong notes followed the downward trend due to the sharp drop in Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rates. In addition, Singapore, rupee, Canadian, and Philippine notes were also in plentiful supply, and market prices uniformly weakened. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes also trended weaker, with the former retreating to 1.09 yuan and the latter falling to 0.93 yuan.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Plunge; Domestic Bonds Also Experience Excitement

Yesterday's securities market experienced a shift towards a downturn, with strong selling pressure and a weakening trend. This was largely due to the uncertain nature of the Sino-Japanese War, which caused widespread unease. Moreover, the proximity of each upcoming interest payment period raised concerns, preventing the market from rebounding as it traditionally would during a gold price collapse. Although there was talk of peace, it was widely regarded as one-sided propaganda. Rumors in Shanghai were fueled by Italy's entry into the war, further softening market sentiment. In this environment, most investors sought to escape the market, making it difficult to be optimistic about the future. The market opened after a two-day holiday, and selling pressure immediately intensified. After the opening, prices gradually declined. Yih Chang and Lien Yih saw the most active selling, while Lok Mou Hong Tai also engaged in extensive offloading. The 26th and Hong Kong Kang saw some buying, with retail investors absorbing shares in successive waves. Class A shares broke through 61 yuan, Class B shares retreated by 2 yuan, and Class C and E shares both entered the 50 yuan range. There was selling but no buying in Class D shares, preventing them from even opening. The market atmosphere was calmer in the afternoon, but there was still no improvement. Ding Yu Ren Chang bought in, Lok Mou recovered Class B shares, and Lien Ho, Yih Chang, and Tong Kang continued to sell. Buying and selling were relatively balanced. By the end of the day, all shares except for Class D, which failed to open, were slightly down by 0.2 to 0.35 yuan. Total trading volume was approximately 800,000 yuan. A concise summary is provided below.

Stock Transaction: 100 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 22.5 yuan per share.

Publicly Owned Stock Exchange: Due to Italy's declaration of war, the New York market experienced a sharp decline, causing prices to weaken. In the early afternoon, rumors of Paris falling intensified selling pressure, causing the downtrend to accelerate. As the rumors could not be confirmed, prices partially rebounded. Ultimately, market sentiment remained volatile, with prices fluctuating unpredictably and lacking sustainability. Jardine Matheson shares opened at 23 yuan (ex-dividend) and fell to a low of 19.1 yuan in the afternoon before closing at 20 yuan. Jardine Matheson shares performed even worse, opening at 33.5 yuan and falling to a low of 27.25 yuan before closing at only 28 yuan. Canton shares opened at 10 yuan and gradually declined to 9.1 yuan before slightly rebounding to 9.35 yuan at the close. China Merchants Steam Navigation shares, which had consistently remained stable in recent days, also fell from an opening price above 8 yuan to 7.78 yuan. Wheelock Marden announced a final dividend of 5 yuan, which greatly disappointed investors. Market expectations were much higher, and the company could have paid a better dividend. However, given the extraordinary circumstances, the company adopted a cautious approach, which should not be criticized. Rubber shares saw very little trading, and prices were generally lower than before the holiday.

London, 10th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for various Far East companies on the London Stock Exchange saw only HSBC shares weakening by one pound, with shares registered in England at 77 pounds and shares registered in Hong Kong at 80 pounds. The rest remained unchanged. London, 10th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable, with no changes in the upper and lower tier bonds.

### Staple Foods: Rice Prices Soar Uncontrollably; No. 1 Saigon Reaches 57 Yuan; Chang Bang Qing Geng on the Gray Market Reaches 62 Yuan

Yesterday's rice market was the first trading day after the holiday. After two days of market closure, there was urgent demand for actual sales. With the holiday period over, credit conditions eased, and speculators also sought to become active. At the market opening, inland merchants actively competed for supplies, followed by customers from rural estates, who were not deterred by sellers taking the opportunity to hoard goods and raise prices. They instead stepped up their efforts because the drought season was approaching, and the weather seemed too dry, causing inland prices to be high, making it profitable to transport rice from Shanghai. Furthermore, the decoration of shops in Shanghai and the speculation by market participants caused prices to soar. Both domestic and foreign rice prices jumped by a significant 2-3 yuan. Foreign rice No. 1 Chen Saigon opened at 57 yuan, Huojiao at 55.5 yuan, and Xiaojiao at 53.5 yuan. In the domestic rice market, rumors circulated that Chang Bang Te Qing Geng broke through the 60 yuan mark on the gray market, reaching an unprecedented peak of 62 yuan in Shanghai. Near the market close, inland customers stopped buying, and as gold prices fell and the exchange rate increased, speculators released their profitable goods, and the upward momentum slowed, with prices falling back by 0.5 yuan.

Foreign merchants and rural estates purchased over 5,000 bags of foreign rice yesterday morning, and shops in Shanghai also experienced increased activity after the holiday. Due to the inability to plant domestic rice, buying interest in the market was extremely strong, with customers, hoarders, and merchants competing to buy. The early market saw prices surge by more than 1-2 yuan. At noon, the exchange rate increased by a small margin of 0.5 yuan. In the afternoon, the exchange rate rose again, and several batches of Siam No. 2 rice were quoted at around 59 yuan. A new batch of 500 tons of Saigon No. 2 rice for delivery at the end of June and early July was sold by Renji Foreign Firm to rice merchants at a price of 60 yuan, causing market sentiment to weaken. The evening market was particularly weak. Siam No. 2 returned rice was initially quoted at 60.08 yuan in the early market, then opened at 60.05 yuan. In the evening market, buyers sought to lower the price, and foreign rice prices also fell by 0.5 yuan. Therefore, foreign rice prices initially rose and then fell yesterday, with the result being an increase of more than one yuan, but the closing market showed a weakening trend.

Additionally, it has been reported that four vessels from Taikoo, Qiongzhou, Yingzhou, Jinan, and Suzhou, have transported a total of 45,800 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. This has been reported in this newspaper previously. Due to the dockworkers' strike, the rice could not be unloaded. It is now known that the issue has been resolved, and the foreign rice can be unloaded this morning.

A total of 1,700-1,800 bags of thick and thin geng domestic rice have arrived over the past three days. It is rumored that due to the scarcity of goods and the soaring prices of foreign rice, the owners of the goods were demanding higher prices, and the transaction was not affected by the high prices. Those who needed it were becoming more willing to buy, causing the opening price to reach an unprecedented high. In addition to Chang Bang Te Qing Geng at 62 yuan, other Chang Kun Geng were sold at 61-60 yuan, Qing Si thin rice at 60 yuan, and Nanyang early and late rice also required 58 yuan.

There were no arrivals of glutinous rice yesterday, and the sales market had little appetite for actual sales because the season had passed. However, hoarders absorbed it in large quantities due to the low price, causing the sellers to be determined. The asking prices rose in tandem with foreign rice, with selling prices increasing by 1.5-2 yuan compared to before the holiday. Jin Li Te Yuan was priced at 48-49 yuan, Dan Chang Bai Yuan at around 47.5-47 yuan, and Jiangbei Bai Yuan at 45-46 yuan.

### Flour Supply Still Limited; Sales More Active After Holiday; New Wheat Arrivals Still Scarce

Yesterday's flour market was relatively active, but factories maintained the original price of 13.8 yuan and were unwilling to sell in large quantities. Merchants still did not have sufficient supplies, and merchants from the South Seas slightly increased their purchases. Merchant prices had risen to 16.25 yuan. According to the factory's intention to sell, the factory believed that there were problems with the raw materials, and merchant prices still needed to be raised. Due to the decline in gold prices and the sharp rise in foreign exchange rates, it was difficult for the market to improve. Domestic flour and returned goods, old brands, etc., were maintained in the middle. It was reported that the Green Mountain Deer price required 14.12 yuan, and the selling prices of other brands varied and remained in a state of fluctuation. Additionally, 1,075 bags of flour were transported to Yantai today.

New wheat has been arriving in small quantities in recent days and is mostly related to certain parties. However, there has been no formal transaction in the market. Most of the Japanese factories purchase wheat from the production areas and transport it to Shanghai. Domestic factories have requested to open up sources of wheat, but there is still no practical solution, so the market is waiting quietly.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Declines Again After Holiday

The yarn market, after the holiday, has returned to weakness, and the decline is even more intense. This is due to Italy's participation in the war, as well as the appreciation of foreign exchange rates and the sharp decline in gold prices. As a result, market sentiment is weak, and selling pressure has increased, causing market prices to trend downward. 20-count Double Horse yarn has once again broken through the 1,100 yuan mark. However, actual demand in the South is still considerable.

In the morning, spot yarn prices initially rose as the US dollar slightly declined, and market sentiment improved. 20-count Double Horse yarn was quoted at over 1,180 yuan. However, in an instant, exchange rates rose, market sentiment loosened, and selling pressure returned, with the opening price appearing at 1,120 yuan, rising slightly to 1,135 yuan. However, rumors circulated in the market thereafter that gold prices had fallen sharply, causing more sellers to emerge, and market prices gradually declined, falling to 1,090 yuan. The market closed at a further small decline of 10-20 yuan. It is estimated that the total trading volume in half a day was 1,415 yuan, with 20-count Double Horse yarn falling by 28 yuan. Today, 142 pieces of yarn were shipped to Ningbo, 288 pieces were shipped to Yantai, and 835 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. A breakdown of the quantities purchased by various merchants is listed below.

### Cotton Prices Fall

Cotton trading was scarce due to serious European turmoil that frightened the market and an unstable yarn market. This caused manufacturers to be reluctant to accept cotton, and sentiment among those in the industry was even worse. Transactions were at a standstill. Only Shenxin Factory purchased 112 pieces of Da Zhong Ji cotton for 220 yuan, which was delivered to the factory. This price was much lower than in the past.

In other news, New York cotton market prices were lower by 3-5 points due to the pressure on the Allied side, unfavorable news from Europe, and some short-selling in the South. The Indian cotton market remained normal this morning, but the inability to ship previously sold cotton was a serious problem. Since the issue could not be resolved, there were no transactions all day. The expected price was 170, a decrease of 7 rupees compared to the previous day.

### Piece Goods: Fabrics Plummet

Domestic Fabrics: Yesterday morning, the fabric market was flat. However, as gold prices fell sharply, speculators lowered their prices and competed to sell, causing the market to plummet. Fine cloths and twills fell by 1-1.5 yuan per piece, coarse cloths fell by 0.5-1.5 yuan, and other dyed, printed, and crepe fabrics were also discounted. However, due to the weak market, it was difficult to generate much buying interest even at low prices. Actual sales customers also adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of transactions. On this street, transactions included over 3,000 pieces of foreign yarn, hemp yarn, corduroy, rubber cloth, white piqu√©, and satin. Merchants from the Wen and Yong regions purchased 100-odd pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth.

Dong Cloth: White cargo Dragon Fine Cloth, a sharp decline, compared to last week's market, a sharp drop of (per piece) 3.5 yuan. In the morning, merchants from Qinhuangdao in the north purchased calico fine cloth, and merchants from Tianjin purchased Dragon Fine Cloth for next month's delivery. Transactions reached more than 500 packages, and the opening market was still good. Dragon spot sales 39.3 yuan, was eventually sold. Eventually, the local market panicked, selling at the same time, step-by-step compressed, to the noon closing price of 36.9 yuan. Later, as gold prices in the spill, the market atmosphere Yisui, the dragon now fell to 35.5 yuan, this month 36.5 yuan, Buji fell to 9 cents 25, medium-sized miscellaneous fine cloth and fine twill no one asked, very few sales.

### Coal: Coal Ball Factory Prices Reduced

The coal ball market saw a reduction in prices from Yi Taixing, Guo Hua, and other coal ball factories. From today (December 12th), factory prices will be reduced by 8 yuan. From the car station list, it is 134 yuan per ton. Delivery to the stall adds car cost. Retail at 18 yuan 25 per and 7 yuan 30 cents per daily catty.

### Sugar Market: Diaoqing Slightly Tight

Yesterday's sugar market, according to Dutch news, coarse white production prices rose to USD 3.12. However, in the afternoon, the U.S.-Dutch exchange rate increased, so the association's price adjustments were initially flat and then soft. The current 14 coarse white, in-warehouse price was 71.2 yuan in the morning. Lack of trade. Outside cargo price was initially 71 yuan, and was later reduced to 70 yuan. Transshipment cargo was initially 57.5 yuan, and was later soft. A 6/20 warehouse list was priced at 56 yuan, the immediate list at 55.5 yuan. Xiaoyuan Xu, Taikoo car white had no transactions. Dutch Red remained at 61 yuan. Guotang had a building help from Taikoo wheel to Diao Qing 300 packages, price of 63.5 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. Market flat. There was 1,100 tons of sugar that arrived from Holland.

### Oilseed Cake: Oil Market Brisk in Morning, Flat in Afternoon

Yesterday's oil market situation was such that, generally, people's minds turned as they observed the good situation in inland areas, so the prices of various oils increased across the board compared to before the holiday, generally by 1 to 2 yuan. However, buying interest suddenly decreased in the afternoon, and the market situation showed signs of wavering. As a result, there were no transactions, and the overall situation may change. Bean cake was only slightly tighter from Dayou Yichang Cake, by a few cents, with everything else flat. 3,000 pieces of Zaishengji Cake were sold in the market for inland areas. Shantou merchants bought two cars of Yuanlong Cake. Quanzhou Xinghua merchants bought more than 10,000 pieces of Dayou Four brand Cake.

### The Great Kings in the Qing Huai River

In the area of Qing Huai, whenever spring and summer arrive, the tide rises and falls, and great kings appear in the river. These great kings resemble snakes in body but have square heads, with faint glimpses of two horns. They are all incarnations of the river gods. Those experienced in river works can usually name them, saying, "Great King So-and-so, Great King So-and-so." Therefore, when a great king appears, it must be reported to the grain transport commander, who then personally goes to the riverbank to guide it in with a tray. He then uses the sedan chair used by the grain transport commander to send it to the local Great King Temple, setting up an incense table and offering sacrifices. All the river works officials go to the temple to participate in the sacrifice according to their rank. The great kings like to watch plays, so they immediately have actors perform for them. The performances must continue until the great king leaves on his own accord. Because when a great king comes to this place, if there is a dangerous river project, the great king will be able to protect it. Therefore, they have repeatedly been honored by our dynasty with titles, and their reputation is glorious. However, they only appear when the water is high, and even then, only one or two appear, not in an endless stream. Yesterday, it was heard that more than ten great kings suddenly appeared in the office of the grain transport commander, arranged in a tray on the hall, and were then taken up by the grain transport commander with a tray and sent to the Great King Temple, where plays were performed as before, respectfully responding to the gods' grace. Unexpectedly, they have been coming and going continuously, for about ten days. Now, the grain transport commander has ordered the opera troupe to perform plays day and night. In a few days, several more great kings successively arrived, and it is now said that there are more than twenty in total. When the local people heard of this, they all marveled! Some said, "This year we should be prepared for floods." Then, the coming of the great kings is probably to make those who handle river works prepare methods for dredging and guiding the water?

Current Events

### The "Responsibility" of "Safety"

‚Äî A Senior

The Public Concession will implement Safety Week starting on the 17th. Over nine hundred students in this city will, as in the past year, cooperate to promote this movement, supplemented by drawings and various forms of publicity. Its effect may create a new "safety" record. However, I still stubbornly hold to my opinion: the "Safety Movement" is indeed a cooperation between pedestrians and drivers, but the responsibility of the drivers is even greater.

A tragic case that occurred on Route 10 bus number 15032 can serve as the most powerful example. The occurrence of this tragedy was because Chen Afa's wife, Ms. Lu, "was climbing onto the copper bar when the bus unexpectedly started moving, traveling a distance of twenty feet. Ms. Lu, unable to hold on, let go and fell, resulting in her head being run over by the rear wheel, causing instant death."

At the beginning of the trial of this assault case, a dispute arose between the ticket seller and the driver over the "ringing the bell." In fact, regardless of whether the bell was rung first or the car was started first, neither party can shirk responsibility. "The bus unexpectedly started moving, traveling a distance of twenty feet" has already judged the guilt of both parties. Even if the ticket seller had not rung the bell, wouldn't they have seen someone hanging on the copper bar during the twenty feet of travel? The company's regulations state, "Ring twice to start, ring once to stop." Between two and one, it proves that if an unfortunate incident occurs, saving the time of ringing one less time could have accelerated the rescue. But now, it is "about twenty feet of travel." What other exculpatory evidence can you offer?

As for pedestrians who risk crossing between rows of trams and cars, or those who race with cars and trams, that is naturally their own fault. However, those who "bring it upon themselves" are ultimately in the minority.

Finally, I will conclude with the conclusion of my article "Expanding the Safety Movement": The "Safety Movement" is not a "fun fair," and driving is not a simple mechanical task.

### Dog

‚Äî Lu Ming

Not long ago, the boss bought a puppy. Thus, we, who live in the monotonous sound of machines all day long, regarded it as a novel object. During our spare time after work, everyone liked to crouch down and tease the puppy.

Indeed, this is an endearing little animal, born with pure white soft fur, jumping and frolicking all day long, lively and lovely. The boss also loved it like a precious pearl, never without it coming in and out. The boss once proudly said to the public: "I bought it to relieve boredom!"

However, who would have thought that for the sake of this puppy, some extra work and abuse would be added to our already exhausted lives? For example, every time after dragging our exhausted bodies down from the huge machines, we would have to do chores such as bathing the puppy and buying beef. Sometimes we even had to take the puppy out for a walk. In short, like a master, we had to serve it calmly.

Sometimes the boss would hold the puppy in his arms and tease it. If he was in a good mood, he would stretch his voice and shout for Ah San to buy beef; if Ah San was a little slow, the boss would scold him unceremoniously: "Damn it! Lazybones!"

Ah San only pouted his lips and muttered: "Damn, I'm not even as good as a dog!"

Once, Ah San inadvertently stepped on the dog's tail, and the puppy whined and cried. The boss slammed the table and scolded everyone. From then on, as long as the dog barked outside, the boss would also shout strangely across the window sill: "You have to be careful! Dog-like!"

But one day, unfortunately, something bad happened after all, and that was the puppy went missing. This day, the boss was really anxious. Sweat rolled down his round face, and his eyes were full of red streaks. He used all kinds of obscene abuse on us, seemingly with the intention of swallowing us in one gulp. Helplessly, Ah San and I tremblingly went outside to look for it separately. As a result, the dog was found, originally dozing in a pile of debris. Then a heavy weight seemed to be lifted from our hearts.

Therefore, the boss and the dog became the two major demons in our dark lives. Whenever we were sad and indignant, an unconscious concept would quickly flash through our minds: "Why doesn't God turn us into a dog?" Indeed, our life is not as good as a dog's! We labor continuously from morning till night, but what is the reward? Our puppy would smell the rice without meat and walk away.

But a familiar voice rang in our ears again: "Because we are not dogs, we cannot live that dog-like enjoyable life; to be a person, one should use one's own hands to overcome all difficulties! As the saying goes: No pain, no gain. As long as we constantly struggle with the environment, one day the light will come to us."

It is in anticipation of the arrival of the light that I am unswervingly fighting against all difficulties and the environment.

### Handicraft Should Not Be Too Difficult

‚Äî Ling Tong

My younger sister is studying in the second grade of a certain elementary school. Today, she came back from school with a piece of paper in her hand, on which was drawn a chicken. According to her, the teacher ordered everyone to make one out of cardboard, as a handicraft score, to be handed in on Monday. So my work arrived, and I had to prepare the materials for her, but she couldn't start at all. I had already been busy for a long time, and I was still helping her cut, paste, color, string money, and bend the wire. It took me an hour to make it.

Handicraft in school is originally to train children's hands, so that they can use not only their brains. But now, some elementary schools (it can be said that most of them, because the children of neighbors often clamor for their mothers and sisters to do it for them.) order students to do work that they cannot do themselves. The teacher simply says: Hand it in on such and such a day! They don't do it in class, nor do they teach how to do it, they tacitly ask your parents to do it. When it comes time to hand it in, as long as it can be handed in, they don't ask questions, they just mark the score and let it go.

Without considering the students' abilities, and ordering students to do handicrafts that they cannot do themselves, I object, although I admit that doing it for them is my fault.

Hawthorne Case File

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

‚Äî Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 1: "A Very Pretty Miss!"

Hawthorne nodded and said, "That's easy to explain. Maybe two men came in last night."

Ni Jinshou was surprised: "Two people? That's troublesome!"

Hawthorne said lightly: "The overlapping male shoe prints are of different sizes, obviously belonging to two people. Bao Lang, you'd better trace these two lines of footprints with paper, designate the deeper line as A, and the shallower line as B." He handed the supplies to me.

I followed the drawing of the footprints, and Ni Jinshou also accompanied me in measuring with a soft ruler. Hawthorne looked towards the stairs at the back and then went into the doorway on the left. After I finished drawing the prints, I felt that Hawthorne's vision was indeed good. Print A was 11.6 inches, and Print B was 10.4 inches, which were obviously different. Not only was Print B shallower, but the prints were mixed up with each other, not as clearly distinguished as Print A. For example, in the western entrance and the space in the middle, there were also a few faint departing Print B's. Then Ni Jinshou and I walked towards the doorway inside.

The room on the left was a reception room and study, very spacious. As soon as Ni Jinshou and I walked to the doorway, a horrible sight came into view. This was the location of the incident.

The center of the horrible sight was naturally the murdered retired dance queen, Wang Lilan. She was sitting on a straight-backed leather cushion chair in front of the desk by the window. Her sitting posture was facing the window, but her head was resting on the back of the chair, and her face seemed to be looking at the ceiling above, as if a philosopher had suddenly discovered a new concept for the mystery of the universe, concentrating on thinking, and becoming wooden for a while.

### The Ideal Lover in the Eyes of Movie Fans - A Wife and Mother Type of Woman

It is not a novel thing for Hollywood actresses to receive marriage proposals from movie fans. However, according to a statistic of these letters, the actress who receives the most marriage proposals is not those charming girls, but a graceful, middle-aged woman, she is Spring Byington, who played Joan's mother in "You'll Find Out." In the past fourteen months, she has received an average of more than one hundred and ten marriage proposals per month, three times more than any other actress.

According to Ms. Spring, "I am certainly proud to receive so many marriage proposals, but I believe that most of the people who write marriage proposals are motivated by ideals, and what they love is not the 'woman,' but rather..." The mother in the "Joan" movie series is gentle, obedient to her husband, cooks well, and does not ask her husband for money. "However, although I play Mrs. Joan, I am afraid that I myself am not as talented as Mrs. Joan."

### Talking about the *Three Character Classic* in Peking Opera

‚Äî Kefa

The *Three Character Classic* was a book used to enlighten children in private schools in the past, compiled by the famous Confucian scholar Wang Bohou of the Song Dynasty. There is also a play called *Three Character Classic* in Peking opera, which is a *laosheng* (old male role) *zhenggongxi* (major play), specializing in recitative, the setting is also simple, the compiler of the script is unknown.

The plot tells that under the account of Ji Yu Li Mouzheng, there is Wen Tao "played by *jing*" (painted face role). One day, while he was handling affairs in the hall, a letter came from Luo Zhaowei, the commissioner of Huaibei, which was read by Wen Tao's thousand-household pass officer (played by *chou* clown role). The pass officer received it and asked the flag bearer to read it. The flag bearer said he could not read. Wen Tao said: "As a thousand-household, how can you not even recognize a character? You need to learn!" Wen Tao took the letter, looked at it briefly, and ordered the official to return and tell him to act according to the letter. The official asked for the letter back. Wen Tao said: "This is a confidential matter. You go back first, and a letter will arrive later." After the official left, Wen Tao called the pass officer to the back hall. The two were old friends, and he explained that neither of them could read, but they still did not know what the commissioner's letter was about. First, they wanted to find a literate soldier, but then they thought that they were afraid that the soldiers would know that they could not read, which would make it difficult to convince the public. Wen Tao then wanted to find a secretary, so he ordered the pass officer to find one.

The pass officer was looking for a secretary on the street, when he met Luo Ying (played by a Jiangdong person), who failed the exam and was in Huaibei to see Luo Zhaowei, wanting to collect a hundred poems and unite his genealogy with Luo Ying, who was from the same clan. Luo Ying scolded him for being a fickle villain and changed his name to escape. Passing through this place, his travel expenses ran out, and he made a living by selling his writing. The pass officer asked him, and he told him that he was selling his writing. Ka said, "If you sell your writing, you must know how to write." Luo Ying replied, "If you can't write, what are you selling?" Ka was overjoyed, and then accompanied Luo Yang to the yamen. Luo Ying saw Wen Tao and bowed to salute, but Wen blamed him for his impolite manners, and seeing that his appearance was ordinary, he did not believe that he was literate. So he had Luo Ying explain the *Three Character Classic*. Luo Ying saw his words and deeds, and knew that he was a brave man who did not understand writing, so he agreed casually. His explanation was similar to the "twisted explanation of the *Three Character Classic*" in today's crosstalk. After the explanation, Wen Tao was very happy. He then took out the commissioner's letter, and Luo read it, it was Luo Zhaowei who knew that Luo Yang would pass through here, and ordered Wen Tao to escort him to Huaibei. Luo Ying then falsely claimed that this talent was highly intelligent and had already gone to the Guanzhong area. Wen Tao ordered him to write a reply and went to the back hall for a banquet.

The whole play has only two scenes, the first scene is the *xiaochou* clown officer, then Wen Tao, and then the flag bearer, the second scene is the *laosheng* Luo Ying, the whole play only has four lines of *xipi yuanban* (a type of aria) for Luo Ying, the rest is recitative.

It is said that this play was arranged by Fan Sibao in his early years, and Zhang Shengkui once performed it. Now, except for Ma Lianliang who sang it three times (once at Jixiang, once at Kaiming, and this time at Huangjin), other actors have not performed it.

### Carole Landis's Marital Changes

‚Äî Shawie

Deanna Durbin's seventh new film "It's a Date" will soon be released in Shanghai. In addition to Durbin as the protagonist, there is also Carole Landis who is about to be forgotten.

She‚ÄîCarole Landis‚Äîhas been constantly releasing two or three new films in recent years, but her reputation has declined year by year, and even now she has been reduced to a supporting role. If it is said that this is due to the decline in her acting skills, she did not seem to be much better than she is now when she was at her most popular five or six years ago. In just a few years, a person's status can be so different. This is probably what is called "star luck"?

When Landis starred in "One Million B.C.", she was a very popular actress in Hollywood. The company authorities and fans alike attached great importance to her and praised her very much, but now it is completely different. It is really a bit "unbearable to look back on those years."

Not only is her career so unsuccessful, but her marriage is also just like her career. She has been married three times, but each time it has failed. Her first husband was Alan Lane. At that time, she had not yet entered the film industry and was working as a private secretary for a celebrity. Alan met her there. Carole and he got married after knowing each other for a month. This rash marriage soon broke up due to incompatibility of interests.

Her second husband was a very handsome man, but later they broke up again for some unknown reason. After Carole left the handsome man, she devoted herself to the film industry. At that time, she had a romance with the stage actor Armin MacArthur, and they got married, but then they didn't get along and divorced again.

These successive marital changes made her very sad, so she abandoned everything and devoted herself completely to her career‚Äîthe screen. This was the most painful period for her, and it was also the period when she was most prominent on the screen.

Later, she fell in love again and recognized Lord Ravensdale as her ideal partner, so she married for the fourth time. But not long ago, there were rumors that she was in love with an athlete again. If this continues, her marriage will change again. Alas, where will her home be in the end?

Tales from the Studio

### Qiu Hu's Wife's Name is Luo Meiying

‚Äî Su Shaoqing

The play *Mulberry Garden Encounter*, also known as *Qiu Hu Teases His Wife*, or *Horseshoe Gold*, is often performed by Peking opera troupes. The whole play is sung in the *xipi* tune. Qiu Hu's wife is called Ms. Luo. Bangzi troupes perform this play with minor differences, and the *dan* female role refers to herself as Ms. Bai, which is unknown. At the end of the reunion scene, the *dan* female role orders Qiu Hu to kneel on the ground and speaks a long passage, enumerating his crimes of being unfaithful, unfilial, unbenevolent, and unjust, which is not found in Peking opera troupes. Yesterday, I re-read the Yuan Dynasty zaju, *Lu Dafu Qiu Hu Teases His Wife* written by Shi Junbao, which has four acts in total (Yuan Dynasty plays mostly have four acts, one act is equivalent to one scene, the Northern Songs call it *zhe*, the Southern Songs call it *chu*). The first act tells that on the second day of Qiu Hu's marriage, they were having a kinship banquet, Qiu Hu was summoned by the government to be a soldier, and the couple separated. The second act tells that after Qiu Hu left home for ten years, a wealthy household named Li (now people call everyone Li Laoda) planned to marry Qiu Hu's wife, forcing Qiu Hu's parents-in-law to persuade their daughter to remarry, which was scolded by Ms. Luo. This act is not found in the *Mulberry Garden Encounter* of the Jing and Bangzi troupes. The third act tells that Qiu Hu wears a belt and says that he is returning home in glory to visit his mother. From then on (picking mulberries, teasing, apologizing, is roughly the same as Peking opera, and is the basis for Peking opera, so I won't repeat it. However, the Yuan Dynasty songs say that Qiu Hu is from Lujiazhuang, Juye, Lu State, and served as a soldier in Lu State, and was given the title of Zhongdafu for his merits, not going to Chu State to seek officialdom. His wife, Ms. Luo, is named Meiying, not Luofu. According to the last song *Cormorant Sha* in the fourth act of the Peking Opera, it says, "Unlike Qin's Luofu, she only tells the lie of her husband for a while," then the Luofu of the ancient poem, "Luofu has a husband," is Qin Luofu, who is another person who was teased, not Qiu Hu's wife. The lyrics of the *dan* female role in the *Mulberry Garden Encounter* of Peking opera, Peking opera is not as good as Bangzi in writing the situation, and when the corner is teased, she does not scold out powerful words, which is inevitably weak and honest, and does not express the chastity of Ms. Luo. If the Yuan Dynasty's corner's scolding is severe, and there are many words, there are "Qiao men and women" which means dog men and women, there are "disciple children", which means born of a prostitute, there are "that animal", which is easy to understand, no explanation is needed, there are "earth destroys heaven slays," there are "that dead body" scolding seven generations of ancestors, and scolding "eating talents," which is the southern dialect of scolding people "Da Pi" "Sha Pi", the northern dialect of scolding people "Ai Cai", The third act and singing in a paragraph said, song name (three ran), "You see me glance, tattoo your head and face, pull me a pull, cut off your hands and feet, you soup me a soup, break your waist cut bones, grab me a grab, I'll make you suffer exile three thousand miles away, hug me a hug, I'll put you on a wooden donkey at the crossroads, cough, eat the punishment of the criminal law, my father never dug up your family's graves, I never killed your family", no sentence is not evil scolding, no sentence is not wonderful essay, try asking if there are such scolding words in Jing Bang drama?

### Gone With the Wind (4) (i.e. *The Classic of a Chaotic Era*)

‚Äî Yao Senyuan

Two months after the marriage, Frank became ill and was unable to go to the factory to work, so Scarlett went to the office on his behalf. One day she was working in the factory when Rhett Butler came to see her suddenly. At first, she was unwilling to pay attention to him, but then she saw that he was very polite and could lend her money so that she could expand her business, so she accepted his loan. Before he left, they talked a lot of idle talk. She later learned that he had been released because he knew a friend who worked in the government. Not long after, Scarlett returned to Atlanta because she was giving birth. Because there, there was Melanie, who could help her. Later, she gave birth to a girl. After she recovered, she originally wanted to return to the north alone, but then she saw that Ashley and his wife were still living a very hard life, and Ashley was weak and incompetent and could not "get to" work on his own, so she invited him to the north to help her sawmill, because Frank still could not get up to work, and Scarlett very much wanted to be close to Ashley, because she always loved him. Ashley and his wife also had no objection and went to the north with her.

In the north, they all lived a good life, and Frank's illness gradually improved. Ashley and Scarlett were still working in the factory. Rhett was also very good to them, but because he had never been married and had never had the burden of a family, he was still living his wandering life. Sometimes he and Scarlett would meet often, sometimes they might not see each other for a long time and go elsewhere to do his business. But good times don't last long. Suddenly, Frank was shot and killed. The reason was this: Because the north and south had not been unified for a long time, the people still attached great importance to local concepts and were dissatisfied with the current federal government. Therefore, there were political organizations, and Frank and Ashley also joined this society. One day, when they were in a meeting, the government found out and immediately sent troops to arrest them. As a result, Ashley and several other people escaped, while Frank and others died in the chaos of gunfire. Although Ashley was also questioned afterwards, he was eventually acquitted with the help of Rhett.

At this time, the author ended a long novel with very clever writing. She not only distinguished everyone's personality very carefully, but also expressed their personality with very good dialogue. The advantages of this book are too many, so writing a small victory is just to ask readers to find it themselves. And this book is very worthy of reading, and you will not be disappointed after reading it. (End)
