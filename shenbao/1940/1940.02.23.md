### The Chinese Army in Eastern Zhejiang Sings Triumphant Songs: Japanese Troops Outside Xiaoshan City Cleared Out; Japanese Casualties Exceed 2,000, with Many Abandoned Weapons and Ammunition; Japanese Troops on the North Bank of the Yu River Completely Surrounded by Chinese Forces

Jinhua: The Japanese forces in Hangzhou and Xiaoshan recently harassed various parts of Eastern Zhejiang. After the Chinese army valiantly confronted and heavily damaged them everywhere, by the morning of the 21st, the invading Japanese were thoroughly defeated. The remaining Japanese outside Xiaoshan City were completely cleared out, restoring the situation to before the Japanese troops' movements. In total, this campaign in Eastern Zhejiang resulted in over 2,500 Japanese killed or wounded, the capture of four Japanese rapid-firing guns, twelve heavy machine guns, over a hundred warhorses, rifles, sabers, and a large quantity of military supplies. The brave and loyal soldiers of Eastern Zhejiang are now singing triumphant songs, reorganizing their positions, and preparing to annihilate the Japanese again. (22nd dispatch)

Eastern Zhejiang Front: On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese army in Eastern Zhejiang attacked the Japanese near Qianqing, driving out all the Japanese entrenched there. Currently, there are no traces of Japanese troops in Yaqian and Qianqing. A small number of Japanese troops who invaded Sanjiangkou and Changlanshi from Linpu have been completely annihilated by the Chinese army. (21st dispatch)

Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, from February 15th to 20th, Japanese troops expanded from Nanning to Qinzhou, numbering approximately 25,000. The Japanese troops remaining in Nanning currently amount to no more than one and a half divisions. After arriving in Qinzhou, the retreating Japanese troops immediately boarded ships bound for Guangzhou. It was also stated that the Japanese army suffered a severe defeat at Jiutang recently, incurring heavy losses when retreating to Santang. Japanese fatalities from Binyang retreating to Santang number around 20,000. Furthermore, Sitang, located thirteen miles northeast of Nanning, was recaptured by the Chinese army on the 11th of this month. The Chinese army also recaptured Dagao Peak, fourteen miles north of Nanning. According to the "Sweeping Newspaper," two-thirds of the houses in Nanning have been burned down by the Japanese army to make way for artillery positions, and all houses in the suburbs have been demolished. The fighting between Santang and Sitang has become a seesaw battle. (22nd United Press dispatch)

Chongqing: Regarding the true situation in Guinan between the Japanese and Chinese armies in the past week, a certain spokesperson told the Central News Agency reporter that, viewed from a local perspective, the Chinese army completely cleared out the Japanese troops along the Yongbin and Yongwu roads and their surrounding areas, and have now encircled the outskirts of Nanning, engaging the Japanese in a stalemate south of Santang and Sitang. From the perspective of the entire battle situation, the Japanese troops on the north bank of the Yu River are completely trapped within the heavy encirclement of the Chinese army, with no room to maneuver, and are indeed on the verge of collapse. The development can be summarized as follows: After completing typical annihilation battles in Binyang, Wuming, and Shanglin, the Chinese army deployed day and night for the second annihilation battle in Silong, Jiutang, and west of Kunlun Pass. When the Japanese troops collapsed and retreated to Silong and Jiutang, they initially attempted to resist stubbornly, but the valiant soldiers of the Chinese army, taking advantage of the Japanese troops' lack of stability, launched surprise attacks and encircled the Japanese, capturing Silong and Jiutang on the night of the 15th. The Japanese troops fled towards the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Tang, and the Chinese army pursued with fierce attacks. The Japanese then retreated in three routes, crossing Santang. Simultaneously, another elite force of the Chinese army launched a bayonet charge at Dagao Peak Pass, also recapturing Dagao Peak Pass on the same night. The Japanese troops retreated south of Santang and Sitang on the Yongwu Road. Thus, after a great victory, the Chinese army, with heroic posture, firmly held the fortifications of Santang and Sitang, and began to control the remaining Japanese troops. The Japanese, huddled in the suburbs of Nanning, were extremely frightened. The losses suffered by the Japanese troops along the way were extremely heavy. At this point, the Japanese on the north bank of the Yu River, due to the Chinese army gradually shrinking the encirclement, had no room to maneuver, so they set fire to the city of Yong, and most of them retreated towards the coast, surging like a tide. The Chinese army launched the most fierce interception attacks at various key transportation points such as Datang, Tangbao, and Xiaodong, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the Japanese. It has been confirmed that one Japanese division is successively boarding ships in Qinzhou to escape. (22nd dispatch)

Zhaoqing: The Japanese troops who invaded Cixi, a part of Xinhui, were blocked by the Chinese army on the east bank of Yin Zhou Lake and have not succeeded.

### The Expansion of Counterfeit Currency in North China; Prices of Rice, Wheat, and Other Items Soar; Rice Sells for 120 Yuan per Bag; Flour on the Black Market Exceeds 21 Yuan

Beiping: The panic over the lack of rice and flour in Beiping and Tianjin is worsening daily. Last month, the price of flour had already risen from eight yuan to twenty yuan per bag. Meat is also scarce. After investigation, part of the reason is due to last year's floods and the current traffic situation, but the main reason is the profiteering of unscrupulous merchants. It is rumored that several ships transporting flour have already been robbed. (22nd Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Hong Kong: A Tianjin report states that the expansion of counterfeit currency and the hoarding by speculators in North China have caused the prices of rice, wheat, food, and all goods to soar. On the 20th, the price of flour on the black market had already exceeded 21 yuan per bag, and it was extremely difficult to purchase in the Tianjin city area and Beiping. Rice reached 120 yuan per bag. Corn flour, consumed by the poor, also reached 35 cents per catty. In recent days, there have been flour snatching incidents in the Tianjin city area. Whenever a vehicle is loaded with more than twenty bags of flour, it is immediately surrounded by the poor and robbed clean.

Another report states that the Tianjin French Concession authorities have arrested forty to fifty people in recent days who were involved in manipulating and speculating in cotton yarn, flour, and various other goods, and will punish them accordingly. Starting from the 21st, they will sell flour at a fixed price of 17 yuan. From morning to night, buyers are swarming, and the price of flour has therefore fallen back to around 18 yuan. Moreover, Tianjin Ewo and other firms have begun to purchase large quantities of American flour, which can be transported from Shanghai soon. Saigon flour can also arrive in Tianjin successively soon, so people's hearts are somewhat settled. However, the rice market is very scarce. On the one hand, due to the floods, the harvest is smaller, and most of it has been controlled and purchased by the Japanese side to be transported back to their own country for consumption. Northeast grains could have been transported into customs in the past to relieve some of the shortages, but now they are controlled by the Japanese Kwantung Army, and are not allowed to be transported out. Although the Japanese side claims that Northeast grains can be imported successively, the actual amount is very small. (22nd dispatch)

Hong Kong: A Tianjin report states that the puppet organization's indiscriminate issuance of paper money has resulted in inflation in North China and soaring prices, causing the people to suffer unspeakably. It is said that the actual number of issues of the "Provisional Government" which announced its issuance a few years ago, has reached more than 900 million yuan to date. Currently, ten-yuan counterfeit bills are gradually becoming rare on the market, while hundred-yuan bills have increased sharply. It is rumored that the puppet organization will issue 500-yuan and 1,000-yuan bills. (22nd dispatch)

Hong Kong: A Tianjin report states that the value of the counterfeit bills of the puppet United Reserve Bank has recently been at a rate of 114 yuan counterfeit currency to exchange for 100 yuan of legal tender. Although the value of counterfeit currency rebounded on the 19th, it was still fifteen yuan lower per hundred yuan. It is understood that the Japanese and puppets have recently issued another batch of counterfeit currency, amounting to as much as 90 million yuan. Also, the Tianjin market for red gold is 600 yuan per tael. (22nd dispatch)

At the end of this month, the five planets Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn will gather in the constellation Pisces, exhibiting the so-called "Five-Star Conjunction" phenomenon. In reality, Uranus is also nearby, but it is unfortunately invisible to the naked eye. On the 11th and 12th, Mercury will pass across the face of the sun, which is even more rare. Only the southeastern part of our country can see it slightly. There will be no lunar eclipses this year, but two solar eclipses, one on April 8, which will be seen in North America, an annular eclipse, and one on October 1, which will be seen in South America and South Africa, a total eclipse. Neither of these can be seen in our country. (21st dispatch)

Editorial

### The Theory of a Secret Anglo-Japanese Pact

Among the recent international telecommunications, the one concerning the overall situation in the Far East that is relatively far from common sense and principle, and that can be regarded as surprising, is the theory of a close Anglo-Japanese pact. It is said that if the United States and Japan go to war, Britain will remain neutral; it is also said that if Japan violates British territories and vested interests, Britain will recognize Japan's freedom of action in China. This theory was widely circulated in mid-month. It was in London that members of the British Parliament questioned the Prime Minister on similar issues; this may not be due to the incompetence of the sender, but rather to deliberate cunning, which also shows the British Prime Minister's ambiguous attitude. It was in Washington that American reporters asked Secretary of State Hull about this, but Hull's answer neither denied it nor said that he did not know, but only denied "having known anything about it beforehand." If one were to engage in nitpicking, could one not interpret the meaning behind his words as saying that he may have heard something afterward? At the time, the rumor was rife in the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a certain political commentator even began to attack Britain for not abolishing the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, declaring that the United States is currently assisting Britain so much, while Britain is not cooperating with the United States in the Far East to such an extent that the American people are very angry. From such clues, by deduction and induction, one can vividly see Britain enduring humiliation and betraying its friends. The gloom spread in all directions, darkening the truth. Fortunately, the situation was quickly denied by British Foreign Office personnel, who stated that such rumors were completely unfounded and that Sino-British relations in the Far East are amicable. The American people's belief in this theory is probably due to the poisoning of propaganda from Germany, the Communist Party, or isolationists. However, after a month, a Washington telegram reported this again, and a certain senator stated that even if Britain concludes a secret pact with Japan and withdraws from the Far East, the United States will never recognize the existence of a state of war between China and Japan and implement neutrality laws, that is, it will never withdraw from the Far East. It seems that the denial work of the British Foreign Office personnel is not enough to dispel the gloom and restore clarity, and only the American attitude is consistently upright and strong.

Rumors that Britain's denial is not enough to stop will certainly not be dispelled by our denial from the sidelines. Moreover, so-called secret pacts, unless accidentally leaked or through the success of espionage, have no objective ironclad evidence to examine their truth or falsehood, nor can one exhaust their full extent by collecting anecdotes. However, there are things that can be observed, felt, and discussed. The rumor spread in mid-month, which was the time when the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty was about to expire, and also the time when Japan was trying every possible means to change American policy. Therefore, the rumor of an Anglo-Japanese secret pact was used to make the United States feel like a lone hand and, as a result, to treat Japan with leniency and retreat from the Far East. This is the first possibility of the rumor. Europe and the Far East are two aspects of American national policy, but they must be pursued in parallel and without conflict. Using the Far Eastern issue to alienate Britain and the United States is what the Far Eastern aggressors want to gain and exploit, and also what Britain's enemies in Europe want to gain and alienate. This is the second possibility of the rumor. Those who plot against Britain are not only Germany, which is openly at war with Britain. For example, Thailand borders British territory, and the Singapore naval base, which Britain has painstakingly managed and regards as the key, is actually under Thailand's armpit. Also, there are the Indian people, British subjects, and Britain regards India as an inexhaustible treasure. Thailand is very respectful of Britain, and the Indian people are also obedient to Britain, but the talk of Britain's accommodating and compromising with Japan is enough to weaken Britain's prestige, that is, to launch a strong attack on Thailand and the Indian people psychologically. This is a surprise attack by those who are carefully plotting to control Britain. This is the third possibility of the rumor. The Japanese people, recalling the Anglo-Japanese Alliance era of years past as Japan's golden age, are indeed numerous. Therefore, using the return of the golden age to comfort the disappointed and lonely hearts is certainly an effective political strategy. Therefore, a secret pact is rumored, and its story is made mysterious. This is the fourth possibility of the rumor. American businessmen with shortsighted views who have huge amounts of trade with Japan, as well as narrow-minded politicians who oppose President Roosevelt, want to alarm the public with the danger of a U.S.-Japan war, so they deceive the public with the superficial talk of Anglo-Japanese reconciliation. This is the fifth possibility of the rumor. The possibilities are endless.

Having hundreds of possibilities does not necessarily mean that it is actually true. Having the possibility of a rumor does not necessarily mean it is a rumor after all. Therefore, we should also consider the facts and interests. First, the threat to British interests in the Far East is actually shielded by China, and abandoning China is completely equivalent to removing the fence oneself. This is a very obvious situation. Second, if Britain shows submission to violence, it would not only make the European war meaningless, but also be equivalent to engaging in a meaningless European war and further undermining its foundation in the Far East, sowing seeds of discord. The impact would not only be the disintegration of Britain itself, but also make France and the Netherlands prepare to sacrifice all their assets in Asia as well. Third, during the European war, even if Britain cannot keep pace with American policy in the Far East, or even follow American policy, Britain relies on the United States for the European war to the greatest extent. How can it recklessly sell out China and betray the United States. Fourth, the alleged secret pact states that if the United States and Japan go to war, and so on, is an absolutely unimaginable hypothesis. Since Japan absolutely cannot defeat China, how can it have the reason to fight the United States? If the hypothesis cannot be established, then what is the secret pact for? Fifth, the alleged secret pact mentions British territories and vested interests, and so on. Britain has received factual lessons from Japan for a long time, so why would it still seek a guarantee of non-aggression from Japan, which is known for faithlessness? Sixth, according to the theory of the secret pact, will Britain's vested rights that have been infringed upon be returned to Britain by Japan through the secret pact? If they are returned, then what does Japan gain from the secret pact? If they are not returned, how can Britain safeguard its vested rights? Based on these six points alone, we can infer the incredibility of the secret pact based on facts and interests. Moreover, it is not only this. During the Sino-Japanese War, China's sympathy and assistance from Britain cannot be ignored. China expects Britain to continue to give it even deeper sympathy and assistance, which is certainly justified. However, Japan's inability to act freely in China is due to the strength of China's resistance. Japan's actions in China, while British rights are infringed upon, can still maintain their legal status because of China's resistance. As for whether British rights can be preserved in the future, it depends solely on whether China's resistance can be victorious, and it is definitely not the real effect of protection that can be achieved by concluding a secret pact. If Britain is willing to withdraw from the Far East, the country that inherits Britain's vested rights in China will certainly be the ultimately victorious nation. It is definitely not because of Britain's willingness to withdraw from the Far East that Britain can compromise by making a reservation for liquidation or an order for sale. Because anything concerning China cannot be approached privately by any country without the consent of the Chinese government. Therefore, in conclusion, we not only believe in Britain's morality, and judge that Britain will not make a secret pact to sell its friends and betray its trust. More than that, judging on Britain's wisdom, we deduce that Britain would not make a secret pact that is both damaging and ineffective!

### US Government Asks Congress to Take a Cautious Attitude Towards the Embargo Proposal; Senate Foreign Relations Committee Shelves Pittman's Proposal; State Department Still Opposes Gillette's Proposal; Concerns Raised by Rumored Anglo-Japanese Agreement

New York - The Republican New York Volkszeitung recently published a dispatch from its Washington correspondent stating that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in its meeting yesterday, completely shelved Chairman Pittman's proposal to ban the shipment of munitions to Japan. It is said that the State Department had requested the Foreign Relations Committee to adopt a cautious attitude toward this proposal, hence the lack of discussion. Regarding this matter, it is heard that the State Department is currently engaged in talks with the Japanese government regarding the establishment of a new commercial treaty. (February 22, Havas dispatch)

Washington - Republican Senator Gillette, a key figure in the isolationist faction, proposed to the Senate that Congress should declare that a state of war already exists between China and Japan, forcing President Roosevelt to implement the Neutrality Act towards both countries. After receiving this proposal, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee immediately referred it to a subcommittee for review. The subcommittee convened today to hear reports from State Department experts on Far Eastern affairs, including Mr. Hornbeck and the Director of the Far Eastern Division, Mr. Hamilton. The two provided detailed explanations of the trade and financial interactions between the United States and China and Japan. According to Senator George, a Democrat, who spoke to the press afterward, the State Department still opposes Gillette's proposal, but the subcommittee is scheduled to submit its review report to the Foreign Relations Committee on the 28th of this month. (February 21, Havas dispatch)

Washington - US Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he would await the resolution of other American demands before the recent one was resolved. The State Department's political advisor, Hornbeck, and the head of the State Department's Far Eastern Division, Hamilton, attended a special subcommittee meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday to explain US-Japan relations. The Foreign Relations Committee held a full meeting yesterday morning, but did not discuss the embargo bill against Japan. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman stated that the embargo proposals remain on the agenda, but he did not predict when the proposal would be discussed. (February 22, United Press dispatch)

Washington - Yesterday, Congress continued to study the issue of US-Japan relations. At the same time, a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee also attempted to obtain information regarding the supposed Anglo-Japanese agreement in the Far East. Rumors of an Anglo-Japanese agreement have been circulating in Congress for several weeks, but have not been confirmed. Democratic Senator Gillette declared yesterday that the reason the United States has not implemented the Neutrality Act in the Far East is the existence of an Anglo-Japanese agreement. According to well-informed sources, the so-called Anglo-Japanese agreement stipulates that if the Japanese do not infringe upon British interests, Britain will allow the Japanese to take free action in China. This approach allows Britain to focus its full attention on European issues. Some senators stated that if an Anglo-Japanese agreement does indeed exist, the United States will not withdraw from the Far East. They pointed out that if the United States were to withdraw from the Far East due to the implementation of the Neutrality Act, Japan would do as it pleases, except within the British sphere of influence. (February 22, United Press dispatch)

Washington - The issue of extending the commercial treaty law is the main agenda of Congress. However, when the House of Representatives met the day before yesterday, only twenty-five members were present, so the meeting was adjourned in the afternoon. When discussions continued yesterday, leaders of all parties vigorously encouraged members to attend, as the issue is central to Roosevelt's foreign policy. It is generally believed that the reason for the House's lukewarm attitude towards the issue is that the law is being extended for three years according to the government's plan, making discussion practically unnecessary. When the Senate discusses the issue next week, a fierce debate may occur. (February 22, Reuter's dispatch)

### US House Banking Committee Decides to Loan to the Netherlands; No Restrictions on Use

Washington - Regarding the bill to increase the capital of the Federal Export-Import Bank by $100 million, the Senate passed a resolution the other day. The House Banking Committee has now brought this case up for discussion. Some members have introduced an amendment arguing that when the bank extends credit to Finland, there should be no restrictions on its use. (According to the original proposal, the bank's credit can only be used to purchase various agricultural products and non-military industrial goods.) The committee has now decided to submit the various amendments to a vote on the 23rd of next month, and then submit the original proposal to the House of Representatives for discussion. According to Congressional sources, although members of Congress deeply sympathize with the Netherlands, the House of Representatives may not be able to change the government's policy of restricting the use of credit to prevent the purchase of various military supplies. (February 21, Havas dispatch)

### US Naval Expansion Arouses Japanese Apprehension

Tokyo - According to a Japanese Navy spokesperson today, the US decision to build 45,000-ton battleships is clearly the beginning of a naval race. The Japanese Navy is currently paying close attention to the expansion of the US Navy. He also stated that the Japanese Navy does not view the US Navy as an enemy and that the Japanese Navy has absolutely no intention of invading or threatening others. When reporters inquired about the Netherlands' plan to build three 26,500-ton cruisers, the spokesperson considered the Dutch move incomprehensible, as there is in fact no need for such large cruisers to protect the Dutch East Indies. (February 22, United Press dispatch)

### The US Continues to Send Aircraft to the Philippines

Honolulu - According to news from here today, the United States is planning to send fifteen giant seaplanes from Honolulu to the Philippines to replace the old aircraft stationed there. These aircraft are of the VP-26 type, led by Lieutenant General Ingersoll, and will come to the Philippines. (February 22, United Press dispatch)

### Japan Intensifies Surveillance of Foreigners' Activities; Yang Ge May Face Imprisonment

Tokyo - "News of News" recently reported that Yang Ge, a reporter for the American International News Agency, will likely be sentenced to at least two years in prison. However, he has already been incarcerated for more than a month, and the authorities may deport him immediately after the verdict. In addition, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has changed its policy regarding foreigners, meaning that when monitoring their activities, it will no longer consider the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In other words, if necessary, it will take strict measures regardless of any diplomatic repercussions. Furthermore, the originally lenient regulations and customs regarding the treatment of foreigners will be strictly enforced to prevent similar incidents to the Yang Ge case from happening again.

### Canada Feels Japanese Threat; Gardiner Delivers Speech

Ottawa - Prime Minister Mackenzie King delivered a speech today implying that Japan may also impose a crisis on Canada. He stated, "The crisis Canada is currently facing is greater than that of 1914, because we are already facing war in the east, i.e., the Atlantic, while the situation is extremely precarious and uncertain in the west, i.e., the Pacific. In short, the possibility of our country's coastlines being attacked on both the east and west sides must always be kept in mind." Regarding the expeditionary force sent by the federal government to Europe, in addition to the division already sent, a second division is currently being trained and will soon be completed.

### US High Commissioner to the Philippines Eager for the United States to Avoid War; Take on the Heavy Responsibility of Rebuilding Europe After the War; Delivers Speech on Washington's Birthday

Manila - Today is the birthday of the father of the United States, George Washington. The US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, delivered a speech urging the United States to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war in order to uphold the ideals of freedom and democracy. His speech roughly stated, "Our country is a nation with a great founding spirit, but what we should pay close attention to is not the past, but the present and the future. What the world needs most today is the ideal of freedom and democracy, because Christian morality has been shaken due to the rise of certain powerful countries and the attitude of believing in force more than justice, valuing material strength, and oppressing individual freedom. In other words, these countries will use force to arbitrate all events in the world. In this war, I pray to God that the United States will not be drawn into the war. If the United States can consider the future, it would be best not to be drawn into this terrible war, and the United States has unique missions before it: (1) Americans must maintain the strength to salvage the devastation of Europe; (2) We must rekindle the torch of individual freedom and democracy throughout Europe; (3) After this war ends, if all countries still need to maintain standards of civilized life, the leadership of the economy must be undertaken by the United States. (4) We must recognize that if humanity cannot resolve international disputes and misunderstandings in an effective way, our civilization will completely collapse. Therefore, we must make greater efforts to seek more effective methods of international cooperation, so that all major nations in the world, whether victors or losers, can work together for peace. Strength and responsibility cannot always be separated. It is the responsibility of the United States to bring these two back together. In addition, there are several tasks awaiting us, the difficulty of which is truly daunting and considered impossible, but compared to what Washington encountered during the revolutionary era, they are insignificant. I deeply hope that modern America can emulate the indomitable spirit of Washington's era, strengthen its strength, lead this dark world, undertake the work of healing this devastated world, and seek lasting peace." Sayre meant that the United States must avoid joining this European war in order to be able to take on the heavy responsibility of rebuilding Europe and maintaining democracy after the war.

### Japanese Economists Warn of Economic Crisis; Expansion of Japanese Currency System to Cause Turmoil

Tokyo - Kojima, Director of the Kojima Economic Research Institute, recently wrote in "Social Times" magazine, "If the authorities do not take immediate action to suppress inflation and prevent wartime manipulation, Japan will experience social unrest, the severity of which will be no less than the chaos in Europe after the Great War of 1914-1918. Kojima said that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese currency system has expanded by as much as 12 billion yuan, or an increase of 80 percent. Currently, the working masses of Japan are more aware of the pain of war. Although their wages have increased, they are still of no help due to rising prices. This situation cannot be improved while the war continues. Kojima concluded, "Currently, the authorities only know how to restrict wages, while allowing merchants to arbitrarily manipulate profits. Our wartime economy will become more difficult. If the authorities do not abandon perfunctory methods and take effective action, the future is unimaginable." (February 22, United Press dispatch)

### Japanese House of Representatives Passes Unprecedentedly Large Budget; Totaling 10.3 Billion Yen

Tokyo - The House of Representatives held a plenary session today and unanimously passed the budget proposal for the new fiscal year starting on April 1 without amendment, totaling 10,300,000,000 yen. The proposal has now been sent to the House of Peers. The House's review of the various proposals will attract national attention. Recently, national attention has been focused on the House's questions about the budget proposal. The general expenditure in the new budget proposal totals 5,822,962,303 yen, an increase of 1,018,418,776 yen compared to the previous session's 4,804,543,527 yen. After deducting the funds allocated to emergency military expenditures and the taxes transferred to local governments' special items (the local government special items were established during the 1940-41 period and were equivalent to the local governments' emergency special subsidies in the previous year), the general expenditure of the new budget proposal is 4,945,606,683 yen. This number is an increase of 824,250,019 yen compared to the previous period's 4,122,256,664 yen.

The breakdown of general expenditure is as follows:

1940-41 1939-40 Increase

Regular Expenses 2,662,709,002 2,069,479,778 593,229,124

Special Expenses 3,160,253,301 2,735,063,749 425,189,552

Total 5,822,962,303 4,804,543,527 1,018,418,776

The number of yuan transferred to special items in the previous numbers is as follows:

Emergency Military Expenses 600,000,000 535,186,863 64,813,137

Taxes Transferred to Local Governments 277,355,620 148,000,000 129,355,620

Net General Expenditure 4,945,608,683 4,222,256,664 824,250,019

The costs of each province for general expenditure are as follows:

1940-41 Changes Compared to the Previous Period

Imperial Household 4,500,000 No change

Foreign Affairs 64,079,018 Increase 6,130,415

Internal Affairs 510,815,055 Increase 179,468,668

Total 5,822,962,303 Increase 1,018,418,776

(Note: The above figures are all regular and special expenditures)

The additional budget for Japanese emergency military expenses for 1940-41 totals 4,460,000,000 yuan, a decrease of 145,000,000 yuan compared to the previous year's 4,605,000,000 yuan.

The additional budget for emergency military expenses is as follows:

1940-41 1939-40 Changes

Army 2,973,000,000 3,143,000,000 Decrease 170,000,000

Navy 737,000,000 812,000,000 Decrease 75,000,000

Reserve Fund 750,000,000 650,000,000 Increase 100,000,000

Total 4,460,000,000 4,605,000,000 Decrease 145,000,000

The above-listed general expenditure and emergency military expenses include all of the Japanese government's financial system for 1940-41, while deducting several types of special expenditure that are self-liquidating. The total national expenditure for 1940-41 is 9,405,606,683 yuan, an increase of 679,250,019 yuan compared to the previous year's 8,726,356,664 yuan. Excluding the 200,000,000 yuan increase in debt, pensions, and retirement allowances, the net increase in national expenditure for 1940-41 is approximately 500,000,000 yuan. It is estimated that the national tax revenue for 1940-41 can offset 3,274,428,817 yuan of general expenditure and 783,000,000 yuan of special emergency military expenditure items, totaling 4,057,428,817 yuan. There is still a shortage of 5,348,177,866 yuan. It is now planned to use 1,671,177,866 yuan in public bonds to make up for the special expenditure, and 3,677,000,000 yuan in public bonds to make up for the shortage in special emergency military expenditure items. The amount obtained from public bonds in 1939-40 totaled 5,651,803,155 yuan. Although the amount for 1940-41 is 303,625,289 yuan less than this amount, it is still very large. It is expected that additional budgets will be submitted in the future, so the number of bonds to be issued now seems likely to continue to increase. As for the projected increase in national tax revenue, before deducting various items, it is estimated that 4,151,784,437 yuan can be collected, an increase of 1,074,973,637 yuan compared to the estimated 3,076,810,800 yuan for 1939-40. The largest item of income, ordinary and special taxes, can reach 901,736,451 yuan. The second largest is that revenue from government undertakings and industries can increase by 82,020,827 yuan, the main item being the tobacco monopoly. The third type is relatively small, with stamp duty revenue estimated at 16,356,040 yuan. (February 22, Reuter's dispatch)

### Japan and Argentina Engage in Economic Talks; Japan Attempts to Find New Markets

Paris - Representatives from Japan and Argentina began economic talks in Tokyo this morning. Well-informed sources here recently stated that the French government is paying close attention to this matter. The goal of Japan's move is to find new markets so that it no longer has to rely on the United States. After the Japanese-American commercial treaty expired on January 26 of this year, although trade between Japan and the United States still maintains its original status, it is no longer protected by the treaty. The US government can implement embargo measures against Japan at any time. This means that Japan relies on American goods for both its continued war against China and its domestic economic life. The Japanese government has tried to express its sincerity to the United States with the promise to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, in order to urge it to re-sign the commercial treaty. However, the US government still considers this road insufficient and has no intention of re-signing the commercial treaty. As a result, commerce between Japan and the United States has fallen into a treaty-less state, and the proposal to open the Yangtze River has been postponed until now due to the need for a decision by the Japanese military authorities. At this point, the Japanese government has changed its commercial policy, attempting to find another way for the goods currently sold to the United States, transporting them to Latin American markets for sale, and purchasing the raw materials it needs from other places. Taking Argentina as an example, Japan purchased goods worth 42 million pesos from the country in 1936, while its exports to the country were worth 26 million pesos, resulting in a trade deficit of 16 million pesos, which has been increasing. Japan is now eager to sign an agreement with Argentina for political reasons. Therefore, Argentina is in a very good position in the current talks. (February 21, Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Asia Development Board Formulates Principles for Businesses in China; Raw Materials Must Not Solely Rely on Supply from Japan

Tokyo - According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Asia Development Board has formulated several principles to determine what types of Japanese industry and commerce may be operated in China. Businesses that rely solely on the supply of raw materials from Japan will not be allowed to establish themselves in China, in order to maintain the supply of Japanese raw materials such as coal and copper for domestic needs and avoid the coal shortages that Japan currently has. To prevent conflicts between the Japanese domestic industrial world and Japanese entrepreneurs in China, the Asia Development Board will not allow the operation in China of businesses that are already operating in Japan. All new businesses will be limited to those that do not compete with Japanese industry. However, this should not be interpreted as meaning that Japanese cotton and silk spinning industries should not expand in China. It is heard that any factories established in China in the future will be built in the industrial areas designated in the new Shanghai city plan. The Asia Development Board has also decided to carefully monitor and prevent the advancement of Japanese businesses in China from conflicting with the interests of Chinese people in the territory. The Asahi Shimbun speculates that the North China Development Company plans to move its main offices to Beiping and Zhangjiakou instead of Tokyo, as proposed by the company's president, Kaya. It is said that if the plan approved by the Asia Development Board is implemented, two-thirds of the company's president, vice president, directors, and 200 Tokyo office staff will move to Beiping and Zhangjiakou.

### Three Britons Arrested in Kobe; Question Raised in British House of Commons

London - The House of Commons held a meeting this afternoon, and a member asked about the arrest of three British subjects in Kobe, Japan. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied, "Foreign Secretary Halifax has received a report stating that one of the three is Reverend Walters, an Australian national who is in charge of the Seamen's Mission in Kobe. The other two, named Griffiths and Peters, were arrested on the 17th of last month. The Japanese side has not yet officially announced the reason for their arrest. Our Consul-General in Kobe, Owens, has visited them twice. The Foreign Office is in contact with our Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, regarding this matter." (February 21, Havas dispatch)

### The Altmark Case: Britain and Norway Continue Negotiations; Seeking to Prevent Germany from Exploiting Neutral Territorial Waters; Switzerland Feels similarly Entangled

London – Regarding the "Altmark" case, well-informed sources here say that Foreign Secretary Halifax recently met with Norwegian Minister Colban, posing several questions and awaiting a formal response. Therefore, the British government does not intend to reply to the arguments put forward by Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht in the House of Commons the other day. However, in practice, regardless of Norway's arguments, the British government has ample words to defend itself. The Royal Navy's actions are fully justified in law, and Britain's current position is beyond reproach. Moreover, British public opinion fully supports the government's actions, giving the government even more confidence. As for France, its position has been clearly stated and is entirely consistent with that of the British government. In short, Germany's exploitation of the weakness of various neutral countries is not new. The current issue is to decide on appropriate measures to prevent Germany from continuing to exploit the territorial waters of neutral countries. (Havas, 21st)

Oslo – The 'Norwegian Telegraph Agency' yesterday published a statement by Foreign Minister Koht, stating that when Britain and Norway held talks in the summer of 1939, the British government solemnly declared that warships should have the right to enter Norwegian territorial waters and remain there indefinitely. The British government claimed that this principle was recognized by all countries. Koht continued, saying that international law only recognizes two types of ships: warships and merchant ships. The 'government ships' such as the Altmark should be regarded as warships and enjoy the rights of warships recognized by the British government, including the right to freely pass through the territorial waters of neutral countries. (Haitong, 22nd)

Berlin – Regarding the British destroyer 'Cossack' attacking the German ship 'Altmark', German newspapers and political figures continue to discuss the matter. Newspapers hint that Germany will retaliate sooner or later for this British act of violence, but officials decline to answer this question. (Haitong, 22nd)

London – According to a special dispatch from here today, Italian newspapers carried a London telegram regarding the "Altmark" incident, stating, "Although Britain and Norway currently have a dispute, good relations between the two countries will not be disturbed." The Montevideo Plata newspaper commented on the "Altmark" case with the headline, "Landing on the Altmark to avoid a flight; from a humanitarian point of view, this matter should be congratulated." The Swiss National Newspaper stated, "The Norwegian Parliament's allowing others to disrespect Norwegian neutrality has caused great concern. Switzerland is now facing a similarly complex task, but despite various speeches, the Altmark incident was actually caused by Norway's misunderstanding of its neutral duties. The British destroyer's resolute action has given Germany a warning, hoping that Germany will recognize that it no longer has the freedom in neutral territorial waters as it does at home, and that Norway will take more effective precautions to prevent a recurrence of unfortunate incidents." (Reuters, 22nd)

### Foreign Ministers' Meeting of Three Nordic Countries Scheduled to Begin Tomorrow

Copenhagen – Government newspapers recently reported that the foreign ministers of the Scandinavian countries, namely Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, are scheduled to hold a meeting here on the 24th and 25th of this month. The agenda includes: (1) various serious problems encountered by the Nordic neutral countries in the current European war; (2) naval battles conducted by the belligerent countries; (3) the war being waged by a fraternal Nordic country, namely Finland; and (4) the economic policies to be implemented by the Nordic countries. It is generally expected that as a result of this meeting, the Scandinavian countries will not find it difficult to decide on various measures in the hope of jointly alleviating or avoiding the current difficulties. (Havas, 23rd)

### British Newspapers Report: Situation in the Near East; Close Contact between Turkey, Britain, and France

London – Today, the political correspondent of the Daily Telegraph stated that it is now known that the Soviet Union has begun to exert its influence in the Near East. According to unconfirmed rumors, the Soviet Union intends to advance into the Caucasus. Turkey and the Allied Powers are closely watching this movement. It is heard that anti-Turkish sentiment has recently been created within the Soviet Union, and anti-Iranian newspaper propaganda has also been launched. Diplomatic circles are now questioning whether this move is a sign of the Soviet Union coveting Iranian oil wells. Turkey is fully prepared for various incidents and is not worried about the consequences of Soviet anti-Turkish propaganda. Turkish military authorities have close contact with General Weygand, commander of the French forces in the Near East, and General Wavell, commander of the British forces in the Near East. (Reuters, 22nd)

Ankara – According to an official announcement here, Turkey has established a National Defense Committee in accordance with emergency national defense laws, with the Prime Minister serving as chairman. The Minister of Defense, Minister of Finance, Minister of Economy, Minister of Commerce, and Minister of Transportation all serve as committee members. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow. (Haitong, 22nd)

### Bajera Town Bombed; Sweden Protests to the Soviet Union; Discussion also Raised in British House of Commons; No Intention to Mediate the Soviet-Finnish War

Sweden – Seven Soviet aircraft flew over the Swedish town of Bajera today afternoon (ten kilometers from the Finnish border) and bombed it indiscriminately, setting the entire town on fire. The Swedish ambassador to the Soviet Union has been ordered to lodge a strong protest with the Soviet authorities. According to the latest news, the Soviet aircraft flew to Bajera Town at 1:00 p.m. today, from a height of three or four thousand meters, dropping a total of fifty bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs, most of which landed in the central area, destroying many houses and immediately starting fires. The material losses are very heavy. Another ten or so bombs landed near a church, destroying a sawmill. Fortunately, the workers had all fled, and there were no casualties. Afterwards, the aircraft flew towards Finland. (Havas, 21st)

Stockholm – The Swedish Foreign Minister has instructed the ambassador to Moscow to lodge a strong protest regarding the bombing of Bajera village, five miles outside the Finnish border within Swedish territory, by Soviet aircraft. It is heard that the village was hit by ten high-explosive bombs and several incendiary bombs, resulting in the burning of four houses and damage to a church. The main road is also said to have been damaged, but there were no casualties among the residents. (Reuters, 22nd)

Oslo – According to news from Stockholm, after the Soviet bombing of Bajera Town yesterday, General Nygren, commander of the northern defense district of that country, recently reiterated his previous order, instructing troops stationed in various locations to use anti-aircraft guns to fire on foreign aircraft when they intrude, without leniency. (Havas, 22nd)

Stockholm – Swedish newspapers have expressed outrage at yesterday's bombing of Bajera village by Soviet aircraft. The Ny Tid newspaper stated that Sweden will not only demand compensation from the Soviet Union but also ask the Soviet side to order its air force personnel to avoid such incidents in the future. The Dagens Nyheter newspaper also stated that the Soviet move was a shocking violation of neutrality and a precedent in the history of aerial warfare. (Reuters, 22nd)

London – Yesterday, a question was raised in the British House of Commons regarding the Soviet bombing. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied that the Soviet Air Force's policy of indiscriminate bombing was reprehensible, but the British government had not lodged a protest because, unfortunately, there was no reason to believe that British action could produce the results it hoped for. Labour MP Hyndman asked whether Prime Minister Chamberlain would consider contacting the League of Nations or President Roosevelt in order to mediate the Soviet-Finnish conflict. Butler replied that the League of Nations had intervened to mediate on December 12th, which Finland had accepted, but the Soviet Union had rejected. The Soviet and Finnish governments may request or accept mediation by a third country at any time, but the British government has no right to engage in participation between the governments of a third country and the two belligerent countries. (Reuters, 21st)

Stockholm – It is declared here that Soviet Russian Ambassador to Sweden, Madame Kollontai, on behalf of the Soviet government, informed the Swedish Foreign Minister that after the Russian army conquers Finland, it will not advance into Sweden. (Haitong, 22nd)

The Hague – Several German aircraft flew over Dutch airspace yesterday. The Dutch government has formally protested. Regarding this matter, the Government Information Bureau recently stated that a total of five German aircraft passed through Winterswijk, Sittard, Middelburg, De Cocksdorp, and Zundert yesterday. One of them in De Cocksdorp was fired upon by our anti-aircraft artillery. Another was driven away by our patrol aircraft in the provinces of Friesland and Groningen. Afterwards, the government lodged a protest with the German government. Also, last night, machine gun fire and anti-aircraft gun fire were heard in eight locations in our country.

The Hague – Officials announce that Dutch anti-aircraft artillery near Heiloo last night opened fire on foreign aircraft of unknown nationality. (Reuters, 22nd)

Berlin – Responsible parties here told foreign reporters yesterday that the London radio report that German aircraft flew into Dutch territory and were fired upon by Dutch anti-aircraft artillery was inaccurate. A German official spokesperson declared that the aircraft shot at in Dutch territory were likely British aircraft because British aircraft often fly over Dutch territory when attempting to fly to Heligoland Bight. (Haitong, 22nd)

Liège, Belgium – An aircraft of unknown nationality flew to Liège, Belgium, today. The local anti-aircraft artillery opened fire, and after pursuit by a fighter plane, it flew eastward. (Havas, 21st)

### Soviet Union Decides to Launch Large-Scale Offensive on Mannerheim Line; Karelian Finnish Shorten Lines; Large Numbers of British Aircraft and War Materiel Shipped to Finland

Moscow – According to the official TASS news agency, the Red Army has decided to launch a large-scale offensive to break through the Mannerheim Line, and the Finnish war can be brought to an end in this offensive. However, due to the solidity of the Mannerheim Line, which is no less than the Maginot and Siegfried Lines, this task may not be easy. There will be fierce battles near Vyborg. Soviet journalists believe that on the Red Army's 22nd anniversary tomorrow, the Soviet army will make progress in that area. TASS stated that the Red Army is gradually becoming familiar with the terrain and climate and will soon launch a large-scale offensive. (United Press, 22nd)

Stockholm – According to a Moscow correspondent for a newspaper here, Soviet Naval Commissar Kuznetsov is said to have flown to Murmansk. The entire Soviet fleet in the Arctic Ocean is now preparing for action. (Reuters, 22nd)

Helsinki – After the Finnish army retreated to the northern line, the entire Karelian line moved. According to the latest news, the Soviet army has advanced towards the new Finnish line. (Haitong, 22nd)

Helsinki – Regarding the fighting on the Karelian front, the Red Army originally hoped to break through the Mannerheim Line and seize the port of Vyborg on the 23rd (the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Red Army), but the Finnish army has only retreated six kilometers so far and continues to resist stubbornly. In addition, in recent days, the Finnish army has abandoned several positions in Karelia, and the lines have been shortened, making them easier to defend. In addition, when retreating, the original positions were destroyed, and it will take the Red Army a long time to repair them. Therefore, the Red Army's hope of capturing Vyborg soon has been dashed. The lines currently held by the Finnish army are stronger than those abandoned. Red Army aircraft are heavily bombing the area, with the city of Riihimäki being the most heavily bombed. (Havas, 22nd)

Moscow – According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, yesterday, in air combat, the Soviet Air Force shot down sixteen enemy aircraft and bombed enemy troops and military targets.

Reuters has learned that 144 aircraft, including 120 fighter planes and 24 bombers, are en route to Finland, with about 40 or 50 already arriving in Finland. A large amount of war materiel and ammunition is also being shipped to Finland, including 150 flat-shooting rifles and ammunition, 10,000 anti-tank mines, 50,000 hand grenades, 15 howitzers, 100 machine guns and ammunition, 24 anti-aircraft guns and shells, 30 field guns, four six-ton tanks, twelve six-inch guns and shells, and ten three-inch mortars and shells.

### Political Strife Erupts in Iraq

Ankara – According to news received here, the pro-British policies of the Said government were the reason for the army's resentment, leading to the government's resignation. The Iraqi interim government, under pressure from Britain, has decided to dismiss General Fazi, Chief of Staff, General Osman, commander of the First Division, and Colonel Yamulk, commander of the mechanized forces. However, there is still a danger of military rebellion. It is claimed that the British authorities have mobilized Indian troops, preparing to occupy Baghdad if necessary. (Haitong, 22nd)

### German Pocket Battleship Lying in Wait to Attack Merchant Ships; Seeking Revenge for the Graf Spee in the South Atlantic; Britain Accelerates Arming of All Ships

Montevideo – La Democracia reports, citing responsible sources, that a German pocket battleship, either the Deutschland or the Admiral Scheer, is now lying in wait in the South Atlantic to attack merchant ships and avenge the Graf Spee. Recent dispatches claim that the German freighter La Plata, bound for Buenos Aires, will likely serve as the supply ship for the pocket battleship. The Deutschland and Admiral Scheer are sister ships of the Graf Spee, which was recently scuttled after engaging three British cruisers. Each weighs 10,000 tons, has a speed of 26 knots, is equipped with six 11-inch guns and eight 6-inch guns, and is said to have a cruising range of 10,000 miles. Both are equipped with diesel engines.

London – First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill reported to the House of Commons last night, at the request of members, on the latest details of the British effort to combat German submarines, stating that British success against German submarines was greater than expected. The German side sometimes intensifies its actions against world merchant ships, and sometimes withdraws its submarines for inspection, rest, or repair. Therefore, the results of British resistance will naturally vary from week to week. However, the success in recent weeks shows that the German submarine sinking rate he mentioned in the House of Commons last December was by no means an exaggeration. The First Lord later reiterated in response to questions that the government intends to arm all ships, including fishing boats, as quickly as possible, and that a strong air patrol will be established to protect fishing boats. Churchill stated in the House of Commons on December 6th that the destruction of German submarines was proceeding as usual and was consistent with his previous estimate, namely a sinking rate of two to four per week, and he believes that this sinking rate is higher than Germany's replenishment capacity.

Continued Losses of Ships of Various Nationalities

Rotterdam – Two Dutch ships, the 4,760-ton steamer Tera and the 8,970-ton motor tanker Den Haag, have become the latest victims of the European war. The Tera exploded and sank yesterday about sixty miles southwest of Finisterre. At the time, the ship was carrying grain for the Dutch government and was sailing from Argentina back to Rotterdam. The cause of the explosion is unknown. The captain and crew have been rescued. The Den Haag, carrying 11,000 tons of oil products from New York to Rotterdam, has been overdue for a long time and has not yet arrived in port, so it is feared that it has been lost en route. It is widely believed that the Spanish Pendulas (2,000 tons), which sank six miles off Cape Villano on Sunday due to an explosion, was sunk by a German submarine. Twenty-two of the twenty-nine crew members were lost. According to the latest information, the Norwegian ship Steinstad, weighing 2,476 tons, which was torpedoed off the coast of Ireland on February 15th, had eleven crew members who drifted in lifeboats for five days and finally landed on an island on Tuesday. The remaining thirteen are feared to have drowned. (Reuters, 22nd)

The Hague – The Dutch fishing boat Barendsz (250 tons) recently struck a mine in the North Sea and sank. All crew members were rescued by other fishing boats. (Havas, 21st)

Oslo – According to today's announcement, Norway has lost a total of 49 ships, totaling 168,527 tons. A total of 327 Norwegians have died. (Reuters, 22nd)

London – The Air Ministry stated that just after noon today, an enemy aircraft was shot down by a British fighter plane near the northeast coast of Britain. Another, a Heinkel bomber, was attacked by a Spitfire fighter plane from the Coastal Command and was destroyed on land near St. Abbs Head in Scotland. (Reuters, 22nd)

Denmark Prohibits Ships from Sailing Alone in the North Sea

Copenhagen – The Danish Ministry of Commerce recently issued an order stipulating that Danish ships may not sail alone in the North Sea unless accompanied by ships from other neutral countries. This restriction does not apply to those sailing to distant overseas locations and sailing north of 61 degrees north latitude. (Havas, 21st)

Stockholm – The Executive Committee of the Swedish Seamen's Union recently passed a resolution stating that the naval warfare methods of the belligerent countries are inhumane and should not be used. Neutral ships should be escorted by warships of their own country, and belligerent countries should not forcibly inspect those traveling between neutral ports. (Havas, 22nd)

### Ye Chuchang Urges People in the Rear to Strive to be Friends of the Wounded Soldiers; Foster Your Enthusiasm and Cherish the Wounded Soldiers Even More

Chongqing – Secretary-General Ye Chuchang recently published an article entitled "Strive to be Friends of the Wounded Soldiers" as follows: The destiny of the nation and the people rests on the loyal and brave soldiers at the front. The lives and property of the compatriots in the rear depend entirely on the destiny of the nation. The loyal and brave soldiers at the front not only support the destiny of the nation but also protect the lives and property of the compatriots in the rear. Who does not love life and hate death? Who has no parents and no brothers? The soldiers at the front have taken on such great responsibilities, resolved to die and forget life, abandoning parents and brothers, building a great wall for the destiny of the nation, and becoming a guarantee for the lives and property of the compatriots. Grateful and knowing, drinking water and thinking of the source, speaking of reason, asking conscience, how should we, the ordinary compatriots in the rear, strive to repay the soldiers at the front? Therefore, their bodies are injured, their health is lost, they toss and turn on their sickbeds, and they are taken into hospitals. How should we appreciate and repay their heroic spirit and painful situation? The same nationals should bear the same responsibilities. If labor and leisure are different, and sweetness and bitterness are uneven, how can we comfort our conscience? Therefore, when we wear clothes, we should think of the cold wind and severe frost, thick snow and hard ice at the front. When we eat, we should think of the soldiers at the front enduring hunger and thirst, and fighting hard. When family members gather together, we should think of the soldiers at the front facing strong enemies and leaving their hometowns to fight to the death with the enemy. We should send them the most enthusiastic and noblest sympathy and reward. The purpose of launching the "Friends of the Wounded Soldiers" movement is to enable every compatriot in the rear to foster their enthusiasm and cherish those heroic soldiers who are injured on the front lines even more. When we do our best to love and care for the wounded soldiers, we are exercising our utmost sincerity and fulfilling our duty. Under the leadership of the President of our Party, the War of Resistance has been going on for three years. The power and arrogance of the Japanese have declined by eighty or ninety percent. Now, the Japanese army, society, and even the Diet are filled with war-weariness, mutual complaints, and mutual hostility. Therefore, our victory depends entirely on whether we subjectively want it, not on whether the Japanese objectively can. If we can show the nation's internal love and sincerity and its increasingly courageous spirit in fighting the enemy, the Japanese will certainly not be able to reverse their misfortune and support their aggressive actions. The loyal and brave soldiers at the front have demonstrated their increasingly courageous strength, and the compatriots in the rear must also demonstrate their loving and sincere strength. The exertion of this strength should not only be used on the soldiers at the front but also on the families of the soldiers, so that the soldiers at the front have no worries about their families. This is a natural responsibility for the compatriots in the rear. It must be known that this is not our favor to the soldiers at the front; it is only a very small reward for the soldiers at the front. However, when this small reward is launched nationwide, it will become a great contribution to the country. The significance of our recruitment of friends of the wounded soldiers is not only to hope that every compatriot can be a close friend of the wounded heroes but also to be brothers to the wounded soldiers. We must be able to take care of the families of the soldiers at the front, just as older brothers go out to fight and younger brothers take care of the family. Those who have money should contribute money, and those who have strength should contribute strength. The people of the whole country know that this is the responsibility that everyone should fulfill during the War of Resistance. However, this only asks us to contribute money if we have surplus money and strength if we have surplus strength, not to give up our own lives and families to contribute money and strength. Now, the soldiers fighting at the front and the wounded brothers are truly disregarding their own lives and families to protect the lives and families of their compatriots. Even if we do not consider the nation and the people, but only consider our own lives and property, we should have a kind of enthusiastic sympathy and reward for them. For example, when robbers break into our gate, and brave men come out and drive away the robbers, but they are injured, can we not give the warriors who were injured defending us warm love and reward? This war of resistance is not only related to the survival of our nation, but also to the survival of our descendants in the future, and to the survival of our ancestors' sacrifices in the past. Our thousands of years of national spirit is to be kind to our descendants and filial to our ancestors. The injured brothers have done their best for our kindness and filial piety, and sacrificed their healthy limbs. If we can be virtuous parents and filial sons and virtuous grandchildren in our families, we must give the most and greatest reward to these loyal and brave wounded soldiers so that we will not be ashamed of our ancestors and future generations. The comrades of our party, influenced by the teachings of the late Premier and the instructions of the President, have deeply remembered the four words of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love. In this time of national crisis, being able to exert more of the spirit of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love means fulfilling more of the responsibility of our party members and strengthening the foundation of the party and the country. The launch of the Friends of the Wounded Soldiers movement is based on this spirit. Therefore, this recruitment of friends of the wounded soldiers can be regarded as a measure of the morality and strength of our party members. The wounded soldiers have done their best to fulfill their aspirations and skills of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love for the nation. We, the compatriots in the rear, living in a relatively safe place, should remember the lesson that "when the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact," and thus not forget the great personality and suffering of the wounded heroes. Only in this way can we avoid creating the pain of national subjugation and extinction. The pain of killing enemies and achieving results is glorious, but the pain of national subjugation and extinction is not only tragic but also a great shame for the compatriots across the country. If we want to avoid this tragic great shame, we must all work hard to love and care for the wounded heroes and reward the wounded heroes and their families with the greatest enthusiasm.

### Foreign Trade in Fujian Province After the War: Exports Have Not Increased, Imports Have Gradually Decreased

Fuzhou Correspondence: The state of foreign trade in Fujian Province in recent years can be represented by the import and export figures of various ports. The total tonnage of ships entering and leaving the ports in 1938 and the total tonnage of ships entering and leaving the ports in 1934, when the total value of trade in the three years before the war was highest, have not changed much. It can be seen that in 1938 after the war, there was still little impact. However, the total value of foreign trade in Fujian Province has been gradually declining since 1935, often between 80 million and 90 million yuan. The long-term trade deficit has fallen from more than 30 million yuan to 9 million yuan, a significant decrease, which seems to be a good sign. However, according to the statistics of recent years, this good sign seems to be true and false. Because exports have not increased, while imports have gradually decreased. After the two have been offset, the trade deficit has decreased. In the past five years, except for 1937, when exports rose slightly, merchants accelerated the sale of goods when the war just started and traffic was cut off, which was a temporary stimulus. Other periods changed very little. International imports were more than 24 million yuan in 1934, and decreased by 25% after the war. Inter-provincial imports were more than 47 million yuan in 1934, and decreased by 50% after the war. This is the main reason for the suppression of the entire trade deficit. In fact, inter-provincial trade has declined. In terms of the percentage of international and inter-provincial trade deficits, 1938 reached a ratio of 85 to 15. Therefore, the flexible international trade and the exchange of local products for provincial needs should not be ignored. As for the shift in the order of import and export commodities, rice, cotton cloth, wheat flour, and fertilizer have always occupied the top few import positions, while tea, paper, wood, dried and fresh fruits, and sugar have always occupied the top few export positions. Now, although the harassment of Japanese warships has affected foreign trade, purchases and sales can still be made from neighboring provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi to promote the prosperity of inter-provincial trade. Regarding the analysis of international trade, trade with Japan and its colonies was more than 6.9 million yuan in 1935, while in 1938, the wartime reaction was fully demonstrated, decreasing to an unprecedented low of more than 300,000 yuan (all imported from Xiamen after its fall). Imports from other countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States have increased slightly. Hong Kong has jumped from a trade deficit to a trade surplus, which is due to the centralized export of local products.

### Suzhou Fishing Industry is Again Controlled by Japanese Merchants

Taijiu Company Has Resumed Business

Suzhou Correspondence: Fish and shrimp aquatic products in this county are known for being abundant. The annual sales volume is very large. After the fall, ordinary fish merchants were unable to achieve the smooth sales of the pre-war period due to Japanese restrictions, and the overall business was greatly inferior. In the winter of the year before last, the Japanese, in view of the need for fish and shrimp in Shanghai, superficially organized the Taijiu Industry Company in cooperation with the Japanese puppets. On the one hand, it controlled the fish, shrimp, and vegetables in Suzhou, and on the other hand, it forced the purchase of fish and shrimp from fishmongers connected to Shanghai, and then sold them to the Shanghai market in the name of the company. A year ago, the Japanese ordered the company to stop business due to staff embezzlement. At that time, the original fish merchants heard the news and all cheered, believing that they could get rid of Japanese shackles. It is cursed that the company resumed business on the 15th of this month. It is heard that the scope of business has been expanded, and not only fish and shrimp but also famous products throughout Suzhou will be manipulated. Therefore, merchants in this county can be said to be in a desperate situation.

### The Four Townships of Kunshan Have Become a World of Bandits

Farmers Suffer the Most

Kunshan Correspondence: Recently, bandits have been rampant in the four townships of the county. This is because the pseudo-Pacification Team of the county was ordered by the pseudo-Provincial Security Team last autumn to go to Lumu area of Wuxian County to assist the Japanese army in attacking the guerrillas. This pseudo-Pacification Team was originally reorganized from bandits and had no combat capability at all. Therefore, once they encountered the guerrillas, they collapsed at the mere sight of them without even fighting, and all the guns were confiscated. They fled back one after another. After these people sneaked back to their hometowns, they certainly could not live in peace, and the villages have not been able to rest peacefully since then. Pseudo-squad leaders such as Xu and Lu in the northwest township of the county have many followers. After escaping from Lumu, they openly used the name of burning lucky money to widely distribute invitation cards to the people to collect money. It is heard that the gift money is divided into three types: fortune, wealth, and longevity. The "fortune" character is 20 yuan, the "wealth" character is 10 yuan, and the "longevity" character is 5 yuan. What kind of gift money should be sent by what kind of family has been designated by them. Any household that receives an invitation card does not dare to send it. However, this is still extortion by officials. Robbery and kidnapping happen almost every day, and they are often committed by these people. The most severely affected are often farmers. Because farmers rely on farming for a living, are attached to their land and reluctant to move, and live scattered in villages and cannot defend themselves. However, the bandits' purpose is to rob legal tender, rice, wheat, etc. Even a pig or a chicken cannot be spared. Even cattle are coveted by bandits. If the farmers' cattle are robbed, they cannot afford to buy them back and will have nothing to cultivate. Therefore, during the slack season, they take them to nearby towns to be fostered by people. However, the spring plowing season is approaching, and in fact, they have to take the cattle back for cultivation. They are also afraid of being robbed again. The suffering they endure is hard to describe. The reason why bandits dare to be so rampant is that they collude with the pseudo-organizations.

The detective team of the Father Pseudo Police Station takes the opportunity to extort money under the guise of searching for guns. As for their methods, they use local ruffians as their ears and eyes, ordering them to falsely report wealthy farmers as hiding guns. When the person is arrested, someone is sent to his home to bargain. As a result, the matter is settled with a fine. Countless people have been victimized. It is heard that a Zhu in the northwest township has been reported to hide guns as many as four times, and the total amount of fines has reached more than 3,000 yuan. Everyone who has some wealth is in danger.

### Tang Dynasty Arhat Sculptures from Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi are Shipped Eastward

Rare Antiques Taken Away by the Japanese Army, Only Four Remain, and It Is Still Difficult to Ensure Their Preservation

Kunshan Correspondence: The Arhat statues in Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi were sculpted by Yang Huizhi of the Tang Dynasty. Yang was a master of ancient Chinese sculpture art. After the Taiping Rebellion, eight statues and some broken pieces of murals remained. Previously, Gu Jiegang wrote an article about them, which was published in the "Short Story Monthly," which aroused the research interest of Japanese writer Nishiya Omura. When he traveled to China, he personally went to the temple to take videos and add explanations, forming a book called "Remnants of Murals." Because of this, artists from all over the world have paid close attention to it. Whenever they come to China, they must visit the temple. Later, Ye Gongchuo, Jiang Xiaojian, and others, together with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, organized the Jiaozhi Baosheng Temple Tang Sculpture Preservation Committee to repair the remaining eight Arhats and piece together the broken pieces of Yuntao murals. On the day of the completion, people from all walks of life went to visit, thinking that these only remaining eight Tang sculptures would be permanently preserved and would no longer be lost. However, since the fall of the counties in southern Jiangsu, the Baosheng Temple has been stationed by Japanese troops. The Tang sculptures in the temple have long been noticed by them. They have specifically transported four of the most vivid statues back to their country as antiques. Now, only four statues remain. It is still difficult to predict whether the last four remaining statues can be preserved.

### Issues of Adjusting Vocational Education and Education in Pudong, China (1)

– Cheng Qibao

Since its inception, although China's school system has been revised several times, it has never deviated from the legacy of the past imperial examination education. It focuses on general training, while vocational education is only a by-product of educational facilities. In other words, China's school system is purely centered on liberal arts education, and its methods and teaching materials are all aimed at preparing students for further education. However, in reality, under today's social conditions, even if education has developed to a considerable degree, the number of people preparing for further education is still extremely small. Most children and young people, those who have not received education are not worth mentioning, even those who have received education cannot continue their studies and have no special skills in production, thus becoming an extremely serious problem in society. Today, general opinions are focused on this when expressing dissatisfaction with education, thus causing the orthodox debate between general education and vocational education.

Objectively speaking, education really contains the meaning of production. If education cannot give the educated a considerable amount of production skills, it will lose its basic function. China's school system is based on general training, and at the same time, people in society still have the feudal thought of "getting promoted and making a fortune," which is the malady of education for decades. Today's problem is not who is orthodox between general education and vocational education, but how to harmonize them, a kind of education, to complete a rational school system. For example, primary school is education shared by the general public. Basic national training must be available. According to other countries, after the completion of this basic national training, those who can continue their studies continue their studies, and those who need to produce produce, each has its own track and development, which is the most appropriate strategy. However, it is difficult to do so in China due to social and economic conditions and the reality of educational facilities. One must find other remedies. That is, in the class where children receive basic education, they must be given considerable vocational training at the same time (the author has advocated that the age of enrollment for ordinary children, especially rural children, should be delayed to ten years, so that at least after graduating from junior primary school, they can also engage in a profession according to their physiological and psychological development). They do not have to wait until after graduating from primary school to be given vocational training. According to this method, the curriculum, teaching materials, and teaching methods of today's primary schools must be fundamentally transformed to be able to proceed smoothly. As for middle schools, they are places for excellent children selected from primary schools to study in depth. They are training institutions for a small number of people. Those who are able to continue their studies can enter ordinary middle schools through assessment and testing (this kind of middle school does not need to be expanded excessively, one should base it on needs. However, on the quality side, one must strictly advocate strictness). Other children should be sent to various vocational schools to create a tenth-level cadre talent who is self-sufficient and self-reliant in society. As for universities or specialized schools, they are training institutions for a very small number of outstanding young people. Their departments should be widely established. The purpose is to create real leaders in society, and one should not allow unqualified people to increase the waste of education. (The End)

Article 8: After enrolling, out-of-school people should actively participate in the school's extracurricular activities and wartime rear work, and must not evade without reason. Article 9: If people who have already enrolled change their address, they should ask the original school to issue a transfer certificate and continue to receive education at the wartime people's school in the relocated area.

### French Concession Determined to Suppress Commodity Prices: Municipal Council Considers Measures; Trade Associations Investigate Inventory Quantities; Four Banks Agree to Provide Funds for Fair-Price Purchase and Sale; Speculators Should Repent Quickly

The French Concession authorities, in order to safeguard the livelihood of the common people, have taken the lead in organizing a committee to be solely responsible for investigating commodity prices, setting fair prices, ensuring impartiality, and benefiting both production and consumption. Those who manipulate the market for profit will be strictly prosecuted in accordance with the "Emergency Period Commodity Price Assessment and Anti-Speculation Measures" promulgated by the National Government on February 20 of last year. Since this news was revealed by this newspaper, all sectors have praised and rejoiced upon hearing it. The Shanghai Municipal Council is also considering a similar plan. Shanghai's trade associations also plan to conduct inventory quantity surveys for various industries to stabilize prices. With the Concession authorities and trade associations advancing simultaneously, the effect will be significant and will greatly benefit the people. Details are provided separately below.

Inventory Quantity Surveys for Various Industries

In order to crack down on the hoarding of daily necessities and implement fair prices for daily necessities, Shanghai's trade associations have decided to handle matters in accordance with the "Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Daily Necessities" and the "Measures for Fair Price Purchase and Sale of Daily Necessities" promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. They have already advised merchants to sell at fair prices and are conducting inventory quantity surveys for various industries. Those who refuse to be surveyed, deliberately provide false survey data, refuse to sell daily necessities at fair prices, or deliberately raise the prices of goods in an attempt to profit will be dealt with in accordance with Article 14 of the "Emergency Period Price Fixing and Anti-Speculation Measures." The so-called daily necessities refer only to those necessary for people's clothing, food, and use.

Four Banks to Pay for Fair Price Purchase and Sale

Regarding stabilizing commodity prices, a fair price purchase and sale office can be established. The operating funds of the purchase and sale office will be allocated in installments by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China according to actual needs. However, its accounting will be directly audited and supervised by the four banks. If the profits of the purchase and sale office are insufficient to cover expenses, resulting in a loss of operating funds, the government may allocate funds to supplement it. However, the profit margin is stipulated not to exceed 5% of the cost. In the Shanghai Concession area, in addition to rice already being sold at a fair price, flour being sold at a fair price, and coal balls being sold at a fair price, it is hoped that all industries dealing in other daily necessities will uniformly promote fair prices.

Aimed at Curbing Illegal Trade

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that the French Concession's Board of Directors had declared "war" on those who hoard and speculate for profit and on the rising cost of living. The French Consulate has just issued a new order authorizing the Board of Directors to set maximum prices for daily necessities. According to French Consul General and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Eugène, he told reporters that they felt obliged to take this measure for the public interest and not merely for the interests of the Board of Directors. They were not trying to hinder legitimate business, but to curb illegal trade. In addition, the French Concession decided not to increase taxes, so as not to provide any stimulus to rising prices.

Merchants' Inventory to be Investigated

The new order stipulates the following: The goods stored by merchants will be fully investigated, and those who violate the order will have their goods confiscated and distributed or sold publicly to the poor. A committee will be organized to investigate all details of commercial transactions, determine the original price and current selling price of various foods and other items, identify instances of excessive pricing, and investigate transportation costs, etc., and then determine the permissible profit margin. The committee will ask merchants to allow the committee to inspect their accounts and check their inventory, as the new order has granted full authority to the committee.

Legitimate Profits Will Still Be Maintained

The committee will proceed with a firm approach in setting price limits. For example, for goods whose original price and transportation costs have not increased significantly due to the war, the maximum price will be set according to the average prices of 1935, 1936, and 1937. For goods whose original price has indeed risen, the maximum price will be set according to the original price plus a reasonable profit. For goods whose original price is not easily estimated, the maximum price will be set according to its capital plus a reasonable profit. An increase of a certain percentage in various commodity prices will be allowed to compensate for labor or additional expenses.

Government-Set Prices for Surplus Goods

The committee will study the causes of price fluctuations, and if necessary, may ask the Consulate General to take charge or authorize a department of the Board of Directors to handle the sale of any kind of goods. If the committee deems it appropriate, it may ask the Consulate General to require merchants to sell surplus inventory at government-set prices to meet urgent needs. Those who buy or sell goods in quantities greater than all existing goods, or who engage in futures trading (such as paying the difference in price without delivering the goods), will be fined from one yuan to one thousand yuan.

Public Concession Considers Measures

The same penalties will be imposed for selling at prices higher than the limit, concealing inventory and falsely reporting sales on the black market, refusing to show documents, or refusing to allow inspection of inventory. The French Board of Directors has not consulted the Shanghai Municipal Council on this new plan. However, according to Municipal Council Secretary-General, Phillips, the Public Concession authorities are not ignoring this general issue and will have to consider a plan of a similar nature. For example, the Municipal Council's cooperation with flour mills to sell flour at fair prices is one of the Municipal Council's actions to alleviate the people's suffering.

### Japanese Troops in Hongkou Arbitrarily Arrest Civilians: Chinese People Deeply Wary and Afraid to Enter; Many are Moving to Concessions to Reside

Since the Japanese Navy Special Landing Forces announced the cancellation of "passes" and the full opening of bridges along the Suzhou Creek and the two gaps on North Jiangxi Road on the 16th of this month, in an attempt to entice citizens to return and restore the market in the occupied area, the barbed wire on North Jiangxi Road, from the Delin Apartment side to Bazi Road, has been completely moved to the center of the road. However, after the opening, feeling that the pedestrians entering and exiting were mixed, they have strengthened security, paying special attention to those who tidy up the bridges.

Arbitrary Arrests of Residents and Pedestrians

The Japanese side recently received a secret report that a leader of the Central Special Agents secretly brought 30 to 40 staff members to Shanghai, and secretly sent personnel into Hongkou to take action. They have become unusually paranoid and panicked, subjecting newly entering residents and pedestrians to strict searches. Anyone suspected of being involved will be arbitrarily detained and tortured. According to people coming from Hongkou, the Japanese recently suddenly and forcibly conscripted able-bodied men in the Hongkou district, and about a thousand people have been arrested in recent days, all of whom have been taken to a certain Japanese warship and transferred to a certain place. As a result, the Chinese people are deeply wary and afraid to enter. There are very few pedestrians on the roads of Hongkou. Therefore, those returning to their old residences are still moving to the concessions to reside.

### New "Police Force" Meeting Not Held Yesterday

"The Mainland News" reported that yesterday (the 21st), it was learned from the Japanese side that after the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" signed a temporary agreement on the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries, "Mayor" Chuan Xiaohuai originally scheduled a tea party for today (the 22nd) to begin preliminary consultations on the details of the agreement. However, because one of the "Municipal Government" representatives participating in the consultations, namely Japanese Colonel Igarashi of the "Municipal Police Bureau," has recently left Shanghai for Nanjing, the preliminary consultations have been temporarily postponed until Colonel Igarashi returns to Shanghai within days. It is understood that the heads of the Municipal Council representatives participating in the consultations are Police Commissioner Major Bowen and Special Deputy Police Commissioner Akagi Chikashi. The other representative of the "Municipal Government" is "Municipal Police Chief" Lu Ying. At the same time, officials expressed doubts yesterday about the complete closure of gambling dens in the Western District within the month as ordered.

### More Than 700 Passengers Arrive in Shanghai on Italian Ship

The Italian postal ship "Conte Biancamano," which departed from Genoa and passed through various ports in Southeast Asia to Shanghai, passed through Hong Kong at noon the day before yesterday and arrived at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf at around 9:00 AM yesterday. The ship carried more than 720 passengers this time, many of whom were Jewish and Chinese employees serving on German ships, but the exact number is unknown. The postal ship will stay in Shanghai for three days and is scheduled to set sail for Hong Kong and various ports in Southeast Asia and return to Genoa via the original route on the morning of the 25th. The launch boat for passengers will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 9:00 PM on the 24th.

### Five Java Ships Carrying Huge Amounts of Foreign Rice: Sailing Directly to Shanghai from Saigon and Rangoon; The First Ship Can Arrive on Sunday; Some Rice Shops Fined for Exceeding Price Limits

Since the national rice was blocked by a certain party and the source was obstructed, the price of rice has continued to rise, and the livelihood of the common people has been threatened. Although foreign rice has been arriving continuously, the price has also risen opportunistically, making it difficult for the common people to maintain their lives. Fortunately, the second fair-price sale has benefited the common people a lot. It is learned that in addition to the constant and large-scale transshipment of foreign rice from Hong Kong, a large batch is also being directly transported from Saigon and Rangoon. The Shanghai Tanhua Postal Ship Company has specially dispatched the "Tjibesar," the "Sawah Roonto," and the "Slogen" to Saigon and Rangoon to transport foreign rice. The first ship, "Tjibesar," is expected to arrive in Shanghai this Sunday (the 25th). The amount it is carrying is currently unknown, but the exact number will not be known until the ship arrives in Shanghai, and the number must be huge. With such a large amount of rice being transported, the price of foreign rice in the city is expected to fall.

Rice Merchants Punished

In order to strictly enforce price limits and prevent hoarding and monopoly in order to suppress rice prices, the Public Concession's Municipal Council has recently severely punished rice merchants who exceed the price limit. In the past two days, there have been many cases of people being detained and sentenced by the court for selling white rice at a price exceeding the limit. The day before yesterday, the Public Concession's Political Department learned that the Taishan Rice Shop at No. 68 Henan Road was selling white rice at a price of more than 50 yuan per shi, so it ordered its staff to buy some, and it was indeed the case. Therefore, Hua Tan No. 361 went to arrest the shop's accountant, Li Shugen from Qingpu, and the shop assistant, Gu Mingde from Jiading. It was found that none of the rice sold in the shop's accounts was below 50 yuan. Yesterday morning, Li and Gu were sent to the Ninth Criminal Division of the Special First Court for prosecution according to law. After questioning by Judge Sheng Shengxiu, Li Shugen and Gu Mingde were sentenced to 15 days of detention each as a warning.

Fair-Price Sale Begins

After the Shanghai Fair-Price Sale Committee decided to entrust the Rice Shops Association to handle the second phase of the fair-price sale, the Rice Shops Association has designated 48 members in the Public Concession and 32 members in the French Concession to handle it, with a total of 40 fair-price sale locations. Each location will be issued a white cloth signboard by the Fair-Price Sale Committee, with the words "Shanghai Fair-Price Sale Committee, No. 〇 Location" and the words "Rice Distribution" or "Ticket Sale." Due to the patrol officers maintaining order, the fair-price sale time has been changed to 1:30 PM to 6:30 PM every day. Each location will distribute 50 bags of broken rice per day until it is sold out. One French currency can buy five and a half catties of rice, which is equivalent to three and a half sheng (approximately five catties and ten taels). At the entrance of the fair-price sale location, there is a notice from the Concession authorities' police, advising rice buyers to be mindful of good deeds, strictly abide by order, and not cause trouble. Those who are unruly and cause trouble at the rice shops will be immediately arrested and severely punished. The second phase of the fair-price sale is scheduled to begin today.

### Japanese Will Use Large Sums of Money to Connect with American Missionaries in China: The Act of Buying Goodwill with Money is Base; American Missionaries Have Unanimously Refused to Accept and Have Sent a Large Number of Christians to China to Engage in Activities

"The Mainland Evening News" reported yesterday (the 21st) that according to responsible persons of the American Church in the city, Japanese political figures have suggested providing financial assistance to American missionaries in China in an attempt to buy American sympathy favorable to Japan. As for the news from Tokyo that the Japanese government has allocated 10 million Japanese yen to subsidize Japanese friendship organizations and connect with the American Church, there is nothing to be surprised about.

Japanese Christians Come to China to Engage in Activities

This Japanese attempt aims to influence the attitude of the Chinese people in the occupied areas towards Caucasians, so that American missionaries will write to their friends in the United States, reporting on the activities of the Japanese in China that are favorable to Japan. The above suggestion is now under consideration in the Japanese Diet. However, some Japanese Christians have been selected and sent to China to engage in activities. Their main narrative will be to cultivate the goodwill of American missionaries in China.

Suggest Allocating 10 Million Yuan

It is understood that the news of the above suggestion was first released in Tokyo last Sunday, including a suggestion from a member of the Seiyukai Reformist faction to allocate 10 million yuan for the above task. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita stated in the Diet that he would consider and study the suggestion in detail. However, according to a missionary, "The Japanese cannot buy goodwill with money. The people's hatred of the Japanese is deeply rooted. If we accept any kind of assistance, we will be suspected of colluding with the enemy."

Using Means to Obscure Everything

Members of the American Church unanimously believe that the Japanese suggestion is aimed at indirectly affecting American sympathy towards Japan. According to a missionary, many well-informed Japanese believe that the letters sent by missionaries to friends in the General Assembly and other organizations have a great influence on the policies adopted by the American government. The Japanese are now trying to cover up the evil deeds they have committed, which have been revealed in these letters, and only intend to use means to obscure the eyes of the missionaries, hoping that the missionaries will praise the Japanese in their future letters.

Hosting Banquets and Making Overtures to Connect

Regarding the Japanese attempt to win the friendship of American missionaries, a missionary recalled that the Japanese often held banquets or other gatherings in the occupied areas, inviting missionaries to participate. However, when American missionaries receive invitations, they often consult with their Chinese colleagues to ensure that accepting the invitation will not be seen as being subservient to the Japanese.

### Banks and Pawnshops Refuse Gold Collateral: All Gold Held as Collateral Must be Registered and Reported

The Ministry of Finance previously approved the decision of the National Defense Supreme Council to strengthen the government's wartime gold reserves. In late autumn of last year, it explicitly prohibited banks, pawnshops, silver shops across the country from storing, pawning, and exchanging gold, and designated the Chongqing Central Bank of China's head office to be responsible for handling the exchange of gold for legal tender. It is now learned from separate letters to the Shanghai Banking and Finance Association that, regardless of gold that has already been pawned or is prepared to be pawned, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China should be informed in detail at any time to serve as a basis for exchanging legal tender, etc. It is heard that after receiving the letter, the two industries have separately ordered their affiliated banks and pawnshops to comply. According to a spokesperson for the financial community speaking to a reporter from Datong News Agency, in addition to complying with the ministry's order to prohibit banks and pawnshops from storing gold collateral, the banking and finance industry has also complied with the Central Bank's letter to register and report the gold already held as collateral to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank in detail. The reason why banks and pawnshops have recently refused to accept gold collateral is to comply with the ministry's instructions. Secondly, the gold collateral business is less stable than commodity collateral, because the price of gold may rise or fall sharply at any time. Banks and pawnshops cannot profit from rising prices, and will inevitably suffer losses if pawners redeem their collateral upon maturity when prices fall, because the pawners will not redeem the pawned goods.

### Coal Briquette Factory Should Maximize Production During Price Control Period; Traditionally, Production Exceeds Sales; Strictly Prevent Inferior Materials in Controlled Price Coal Briquettes

Coal and Firewood Dealers Please Provide Spot Goods to Aid the Poor

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent two letters to the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association yesterday, stating: (1) Respectfully addressing, regarding the matter of coal briquette price control, it should be complemented by each coal briquette factory maximizing production to regulate supply and demand. This matter has already been resolved by your council, and our chamber has sent a special letter to your association, requesting that you distribute it to the relevant businesses to comply with the record. However, regarding the actual production situation, whether it can achieve the maximum extent should be investigated by your association sending personnel to the factories every day, creating a report of their daily output, factory by factory, for assessment and comparison, so that the original intention of the resolution can be thoroughly implemented. It is hoped that you will investigate and handle this matter. Furthermore, according to the industry's key figures, the traditional production volume of the coal briquette industry is around 1,500 tons per day, while the sales volume is only over 1,000 tons. If each factory can continue to maximize production as usual, there is no need to worry about shortages. We are also providing this information. (2) Respectfully addressing, regarding the holders of coal briquette warehouse receipts, your association has previously resolved, and our chamber has jointly announced, that they should pay the warehouse rent and release the briquettes within ten days, from February 20th to the 29th. Sales should be stopped after the deadline. Your association is requested to investigate and report the name of the holder, the quantity of briquettes in storage, the warehouse receipt number, and the original price at that time, one by one, and list them in a report, as a basis for handling the matter according to the resolution. This is a matter of great importance. It is reported that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also sent letters to the Public Concession’s Municipal Council and the French Concession’s Board of Directors yesterday, requesting that they instruct the police authorities to take care of the various coal briquette shops selling at controlled prices in order to protect them. However, according to letters from various residents within the concession, the coal briquettes purchased in recent days contain a lot of mud and little coal, indicating a reduction in materials. This may be the work of a small number of coal briquette merchants, and the industry should step up efforts to expose them.

Small-Scale Coal Briquettes to Be Delivered Separately

The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association held a joint meeting of representatives from various factories at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent Yan Esheng to provide guidance. Chairman Chen Cuifang first reported the purpose of the meeting, and each representative reported the situation of selling coal briquettes at controlled prices. Immediately afterwards, resolutions were discussed and passed: (1) A letter requesting Hancheng, Tongcheng, Damao, and Three Companies to open up coal dust cases was resolved and passed. A copy of the letter is recorded. (2) Small-scale deliveries requiring store delivery will add 20 cents for delivery, and the Chamber of Commerce will issue a notice to alleviate the suffering of overcrowding. The resolution was passed. (3) The movement to reduce water transport costs was resolved and passed. (4) The price control issue will be discussed and resolved by each public group in a proper manner. (5) The factory production volume will be reported to the Chamber of Commerce for record-keeping. The resolution was passed. The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 PM.

Order Issued to Prohibit Price Gouging

The Shanghai Firewood and Charcoal Trade Association received a letter from Wu Shaoshu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, yesterday, instructing them to urge member firewood and charcoal shops to strictly abide by the joint announcement of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Coal Briquette Charity Association, to implement the sale of coal briquettes at controlled prices. Those who do not comply with the stipulated prices, arbitrarily raise prices, or claim to be out of stock and refuse to sell will be severely punished. At the same time, those who hoard coal briquettes for profit will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with.

Coal and Firewood Dealers Please Provide Spot Goods

The Shanghai Coal Merchants United Association sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and other parties yesterday, stating: Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association jointly issued a notice of relief coal briquettes this month on the 20th, suppressing the selling price of coal briquettes to stabilize the market. We express our sincere sympathy. Our association has recently received reports from various member merchants stating that the goods released by various coal briquette factories are entirely for the needs of warehouse receipt holders to pick up goods. There are occasional small amounts of coal briquettes supplied, and even some county brands have stopped wholesale. As a result, it is impossible to wholesale spot goods without warehouse receipts.

Shops Will Have No Goods for Sale

Or a few have some stock, and it is difficult to maintain several days of business. Customers are unaware and believe that the firewood and charcoal shops are using the excuse of being out of stock to refuse to sell at controlled prices, resulting in many disputes. A remedy needs to be discussed. It is requested that the factories supply each firewood and charcoal shop with the daily amount of spot coal briquettes sold to maintain business. The letter also stated that the members of our association are all small-scale coal and firewood shops, and coal briquettes are one of their side businesses. In recent years, the prices of various fuels have increased, and it has become even worse recently. Although the price of coal briquettes has also increased,

In Terms of Effectiveness,

it is more economical than other fuels and has become a necessity for fuel users. The firewood and charcoal shops have also shifted from a side business to a large-scale sales item. Most of the firewood and charcoal shops are operated with small capital, and recently, all purchases require cash transactions. Door sales are sold as soon as they are wholesaled in order to turn over capital. Those with slightly thicker capital can only prepare a few days' worth of sales. They rely on upstream suppliers to supply spot goods at any time to meet the market. The retail price is also based on changes in the purchase price in order to maintain costs and slightly reduce expenses. The customers are the general poor households who make up the largest number of city residents. Their purchases range from two or three cents

To Less Than One Yuan.

This is because their economic strength is weak and their housing is cramped, so they cannot buy in large quantities. The above is the situation of the small-scale coal and firewood shop business, which is significantly different from large-scale capital operations. Now, the coal briquettes from each factory are entirely for the needs of warehouse receipt holders to pick up goods. Firewood and charcoal shops without warehouse receipts will inevitably run out of stock and have nothing to sell. Each factory's coal briquettes are sold at controlled prices, and each person is limited to one load. Poor households have no ability to buy in loads. The firewood and charcoal shops are also out of stock. In this situation, there is a real risk of running out of food. The method of each factory selling coal briquettes at controlled prices is very good. However, the attention is not yet paid to this group of people with the lowest purchasing power.

Poor Households

have not been paid attention to, and it seems that the relief is not comprehensive. I believe that since the factory is willing to fulfill its responsibility for relief, it should not ignore the fuel for these poor households. If each factory can supply each firewood and charcoal shop with the daily amount of spot coal briquettes sold at controlled prices, and each firewood and charcoal shop also sells them at controlled prices in the market, and if there are any unexpected price increases, please have the authorities sanction them. If this is the case, then the general poor can all buy coal briquettes at controlled prices, and each firewood and charcoal shop can continue its business. This is the most appropriate way to supplement the relief. I hope that your association will look into the above situation and adopt it, and please ask each coal briquette factory to supply goods immediately to maintain business and stabilize the market. We are grateful for your cooperation.

### Salvation Army Issues Statement Regarding Donations for Shelters; Please Submit Donations to Relief Association

The Salvation Army's Shanghai District issued a notice yesterday stating: The annual donation that our army is currently soliciting is specifically for handling all the work and relief charity activities of the measures taken, and to follow the intentions of the donations from all walks of life. The Dunxin Road No. 1 Shelter run by our institute is entirely managed by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association under commission, and all its expenses have always been provided by the Shanghai Relief Association. Our army is only responsible for management, so in the future, those who donate to the shelter can submit it directly to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. In addition to the funds and titles previously donated by all walks of life

Another Notice Will Be Published

to avoid misunderstandings, we hereby declare. Salvation Army Brigadier-General Morris announced yesterday that the total amount of donations this weekend increased to more than 94,000 yuan, bringing the total to more than 114,000 yuan. Today's largest donation was 500 yuan, and the smallest was 7 yuan. The delivery vehicles for distributing hot meals still appear on the streets every night. In addition, rice tickets are distributed to rickshaw pullers. The number of rickshaw pullers receiving tickets is large, but the order is well-maintained.

### White Russian Youth Invents Truck Load Measuring Device; Experts Tested It Yesterday Morning and Found It Very Accurate; Still Needs Improvement and Plans to Sell to American Automakers

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the city's thoroughfares and bridges are easily damaged by trucks with excessive loads. The police department finds the procedures complicated and difficult to prove that trucks are overloaded, which makes it difficult to arrest them. This has become a traffic problem. Now, a White Russian youth named G. Timoloyov, who has lived in Shanghai for eleven years, has invented a truck load measuring device. The device costs very little to manufacture but is very applicable. The measuring device is shaped like a box and is installed between the truck's spring and the body. A wired battery connects to a special indicator installed near the front windshield of the truck. At a glance, you can tell whether the truck is overloaded. This (22nd) morning, Mr. Gan invited technical experts from the Public Concession Police Department and the Health Department to view the measuring device's test. A truck was used to carry 8,500 pounds of goods, which was then increased to 9,000 pounds. The weight shown by the measuring device was indeed accurate. Afterwards, Mr. Gan stated that he plans to wait another half a year to improve the device and then hopes to sell it to American automakers.

Police Department Solicits Residents to Install Alarm Systems

During this extraordinary period, thieves are rampant, and Shanghai residents often feel disturbed. In view of this, the Public Concession's Municipal Council's police authorities are planning a prevention plan and soliciting public support. If each household installs a simple and effective alarm, not only can the whole family be kept safe forever, but it can also assist the police authorities in eliminating crime and stabilizing society. If any household intends to install one, they can go to the nearest police station to obtain a brochure on the alarm system. If you want to test it in person, you can visit Room 303, 3rd Floor, Public Concession Police Department, No. 185 Fuzhou Road, during daily office hours to contact them.

### Robbers Mixed into Public Buses; Intended to Rob Gamblers; Shocking Robbery Case at Jing'an Temple; Ticket Salesman Discovered and Drove Bus to Police Station; Detectives Surrounded and Captured Three Robbers

At 2:40 PM yesterday, a double-decker bus No. X of the British merchant's Route 1 was driving from the cross-border road construction area of ​​West Shanghai to the concession when three robbers with hidden pistols mixed into the bus. When the bus reached the middle of the journey, the robbers took out their guns and planned to rob a well-dressed passenger. At that time, fortunately, the ticket salesman and the person in charge of opening and closing the bus door saw the opportunity and responded accordingly, and refused to open the bus door from beginning to end. One side

Secretly Instructed the Driver

to drive at full speed towards Jing'an Temple Road. In the blink of an eye, the bus had arrived in the Special Zone, about 30 to 40 yards east of the Paramount Ballroom. At that time, the two robbers saw the situation and knew that things were not going well, so they fired two shots, forcing them to open the bus door, hoping to escape. The bullets that were fired broke a piece of glass next to the bus. At that time, there were many people on the road there,

Suddenly Heard Gunshots

and the order was in chaos. The traffic light guard and the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station of this newspaper were dispatched. Fortunately, the police station was close at hand, and immediately mobilized a large number of Chinese and Indian detectives, more than 50 people, and rushed to the scene, surrounding the bus on all sides. After a Western detective bravely called to open the bus door, three Chinese detectives boarded the bus and

Disarmed the Robbers

At the same time, an order was issued to drive the bus, along with all the passengers, to the police station together. The detectives surrounded and moved forward. After the bus arrived at the police station, the three robbers were first escorted off the bus, and at the same time, all the passengers were interrogated one by one, and then released. According to eyewitnesses, the robbers secretly followed a

Winning Gambler

onto the bus from a gambling den in West Shanghai, intending to rob him mid-way and escape from the bus. Unexpectedly, their robbery luck was not good and they were caught. In recent months, similar cases have occurred in West Shanghai and are too numerous to mention. All of them have not been reported because the owners of the stolen items were unwilling to publicize it, so the public is unaware of it.

### Woman Nearly Kidnapped at the Intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road; Woman Cried for Help and Villain Fired a Shot That Missed; Two Criminals Fled Without a Trace Afterwards

At about 5:00 PM yesterday, the West Shanghai branch of Yunfei Automobile Company received a phone call requesting a car to be dispatched immediately to No. 65 Daxilu Hongye Garden. The company immediately sent car No. 12245. When the car arrived at the front of Hongye Garden, there were already two men waiting. The two men then boarded the car one after another, ordering the driver to drive to Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road.

The Yunfei car, along with the driver, was taken to the police station for questioning.

### Buying Controlled Price Flour; Money Stolen and Thrown into the River; Fortunately Rescued and Bystanders Gave Generously; Snack Shop Owner Greedy for Petty Gains Harmed People

Tan Shunkun, a 49-year-old man from Yixing, lived at No. 659 Tiantong Road. The owner of the Guifangqi snack shop paid 10 yuan and 3 cents and entrusted him to buy a bag of flour at the controlled price flour distribution point, and gave him another 1 yuan in legal currency as a reward. Tan immediately took the money to the controlled price flour distribution point and saw a sea of people buying flour. When Tan squeezed to the window of the controlled price flour distribution point and took the money out of the bag, the money had already been stolen by a pickpocket. Helpless, he had to return to the store to explain to the owner. The owner was very dissatisfied when he heard this and suspected that Tan had embezzled the money. The two parties broke up unhappily. Tan felt wronged and wanted to die. He then went to the bridge over the Potang Lane on Shanxi Road and threw himself into the sea to commit suicide. Later, a Chinese detective No. 1302 saw it and tried to rescue him. A passerby inquired about the situation and took out 11 yuan in legal currency from the bag and gave it to him. The Chinese detective urgently summoned an ambulance and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Because he had swallowed too much water, Tan was not very clear-headed at the time. The legal currency given by the passerby was taken by the detective and kept at the police station.

### Gun Case on Rue Massenet; Caused by a Search for Drugs; Thugs Forced the Release of a Female Drug Trafficker; A Bullet Flew and Killed an Innocent Person

### Finance Many Foreign Exchange Longs Turn to Selling

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates unchanged. The gray market for British and American exchange rates started tight but loosened, ultimately stabilizing, mainly due to the influx of telegraphic transfers from Hong Kong. Initially, overseas rates for US and British exchange rose by one cent, leading to an opening market showing a stable British rate and a looser American rate. Subsequently, due to forceful buying by Chinese banks such as Shanghai and speculators and foreign firms, the market briefly tightened and weakened. At 9:45 AM, British gold reached 4/1/5625, and the US exchange rate reached 6.84375 yuan. Later, due to the sudden influx of telegraphic transfers from Hong Kong, some profit-taking by Sassoon's long positions, and some sales by those holding floating long positions for the current month, the market stabilized. After 11:00 AM, there was little discussion or trading, and the market was quiet. In the early afternoon, continued selling by Chinese merchants holding positions for the current month and further sales of telegraphic transfers from Hong Kong caused rates to briefly rise to 4/2/03125 and 6.9375 yuan, respectively. Finally, Chinese merchants returned to buy forward contracts, so at the close, British gold was still 4/1/875, and the US exchange rate was still 6.90625 yuan. As a result, British exchange was stable, and American exchange rose by 0.03125 compared to the previous day. The swap rate for this month and March was about 1.09375 US cents for banks, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 1.6375%, or about 1.38% per month.

Sassoon and Hong Kong Banks Both Offer Sales

Early in the morning, the London cable showed spot rates down 25 and forward rates down 1875. The New York silver price remained stable, and the London gold price was fixed. British exchange rates were stable against US and French currencies and down 0.0625 against Shanghai. The US dollar rose one cent against the British pound, unchanged against Shanghai, and up half a cent against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling rates of 4/1/875 for British gold and 6.90625 yuan for US exchange, due to the rise in exchange rates. After the opening, Chinese banks such as Shanghai took the lead in aggressive buying, followed by foreign firms and speculators, who also bought to close their positions. It was estimated that Chinese banks closed with foreign banks at spot British gold at 4/1/71875 and spot US exchange at 6.875 yuan, and March US exchange at 6.78125 yuan. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax announcement showed a drop of 1.5 cents. Subsequently, Chinese banks, Chinese merchants, and foreign firms bought March US exchange at 6.75 yuan from a certain favorable bank. At this time, spot British gold fell to 4/1/5625, and the US exchange rate retreated to 6.84375 yuan. Around 10:00 AM, a sudden influx of telegraphic transfers from Hong Kong and selling by Sassoon, as well as profit-taking by a few speculators holding long positions for the current month, caused the market to stabilize. It was estimated that Hong Kong telegraphic transfers sold spot British gold at 4/1/875 to foreign banks, and Sassoon sold spot US exchange at 6.90625 yuan to a favorable Chinese-Belgian bank. At the same time, Chinese merchants also sold March US exchange at 6.90625 yuan to Chase Bank. After 11:00 AM, buying and selling suddenly became scarce, and the market appeared stagnant. By the close, British gold was still 4/1/875, and the US exchange rate was still 6.90625 yuan, with no change from the morning opening.

American Rate Up, British Rate Stable at Closing

The aftermarket was very quiet. Initially, Chinese merchants continued to sell their long positions for the current month, causing Hong Kong telegraphic transfers to come back to sell. It was estimated that Chinese merchants sold current-month US exchange at 6.90625 yuan to a certain bank, and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers sold spot British gold at 4/2/03125 to foreign banks. At this time, spot US exchange was at 6.9375 yuan, difficult to close or sell. Afterwards, some domestic entities suddenly pushed up forward rates, closing March US exchange at 6.8125 yuan and April US exchange at 6.875 yuan with foreign banks. Therefore, the process stabilized the market. By the evening close, British gold was at 4/1/875, and the US exchange rate was at 6.90625 yuan, both the same as the higher prices of the current month. Next-month British gold was at 4/1/40625, and the US exchange rate was at 6.8125 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British was stable, American was up 0.03125, forward British gold was down 0.015625, and the US exchange rate was up 0.03125.

### Sluggish Gold Market

Yesterday's cash gold bar gray market continued its meandering trend, generally fluctuating around 48 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 18 yuan. This was due to weak buying from Hong Kong banks and continued selling by those with profitable floating long positions. The prospects for recovery are difficult. The market opened flat and weak, with a price of 4780 yuan, down about ten yuan. However, soon after, the exchange market reported tightening, and buying sentiment suddenly increased. A certain money exchange firm took the lead in frantically scooping up gold, and a certain gold firm also followed suit, pushing the price to a peak of 4820 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market turned from tight to stable, market sentiment frequently shifted. The gold firm took the lead in reversing from buying to selling, and securities firms, jewelry stores, and retail investors also competed to sell, pushing the price down to a low of 4755 yuan before the midday close. The market stabilized slightly at noon, at 4765 yuan. The afternoon market was quiet, with little change, fluctuating by only a few yuan. As a result, due to buying by a certain bank, the price rose by several yuan, closing at 4772 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was approximately two thousand several hundred taels. Jewelry stores quoted decorative gold down by five yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained stable.

Gold Bar Continues to Fall by Eighteen Yuan

From the start of the morning, the market opened flat and weak. A cash gold firm sold 50 taels to a money exchange firm at 4780 yuan, down ten yuan from the previous day. Shortly after, the foreign exchange market reported weakening, and buying interest followed suit. A certain money exchange firm took the lead in aggressive buying, and soon after, a certain gold firm also followed suit, causing the price to jump. Shortly thereafter, it surged forty yuan. Jewelry stores traded 20 taels with each other at 4820 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange market stabilized, the gold firm immediately reversed to selling, and the money exchange firm also sold, causing a pullback of twenty yuan. The gold firm sold 50 taels to securities firms at 4800 yuan. Later, a certain store, acting on behalf of a customer, aggressively bought, then raised the price by another ten yuan, buying a total of 50 taels from securities firms, etc., for 4810 yuan. Soon, as the exchange market strengthened, retail investors frequently came to sell off their positions, and jewelry stores and securities firms also competed to sell, causing a gradual decrease of thirty-five yuan. The gold firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm at 4775 yuan. At that time, a certain bank came to scoop up gold, raising the price by ten yuan. Ultimately, because sellers came one after another, and securities firms and retail investors continued to sell, the price fell again by twenty yuan. Securities firms did 20 taels of offsetting trades for 4755 yuan. Near the close, jewelry stores took advantage of the low price to pull in gold, raising the price by ten yuan. Jewelry stores traded 20 taels with each other at 4765 yuan for the midday close price. In the early afternoon, the market opened up by five yuan. Jewelry stores initially bought 20 taels from gold firms for 4770 yuan. Shortly after, jewelry stores and money exchange firms sold off, pressing down the price by ten yuan. Jewelry stores traded 30 taels with each other at 4760 yuan. Later, a certain bank and securities firms bought, raising the price by fifteen yuan. Securities firms bought 10 taels from money exchange firms for 4775 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange market strengthened slightly, and money exchange firms sold off, and cash gold firms also came to sell, pressing down the price by sixteen yuan. Money exchange firms sold 20 taels to jewelry stores for 4759 yuan. Afterwards, another money exchange firm suddenly came to scoop up gold, and the exchange market reported a return to stability, raising the price by eleven yuan. Money exchange firms traded 50 taels with each other at 4772 yuan for the evening close price. As a result, the price continued to fall by eighteen yuan compared to the previous day, fluctuating by sixty-five yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold firms' own-brand gold was five yuan higher than the gold bar price and ten yuan lower for buying in. Cash gold was sold at over forty yuan lower than the listed gold price.

Jewelry Gold Quoted Down by Five Yuan

The exchange price for jewelry gold at jewelry stores was initially 485 yuan at Da Tong Hang, but it was quoted down by five yuan at noon. As a result, Da Tong Hang changed its quote to 480 yuan. The new firms quoted the same as the higher price, and the buying price was reduced by about fifteen yuan.

### Discount Rates Rise Sharply

—Slight Retreat in the Afternoon—

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts rose sharply and then retreated slightly. The discount rate per thousand yuan had jumped to over fifty yuan. In the morning, due to a sudden increase in demand for cash for stock settlements by Western merchants, the rate rose from fifty yuan to fifty-nine yuan, then retreated to fifty-three yuan. In the afternoon, after the settlements were completed and funds became more readily available, the rate fell to 51.5 yuan, two and a half yuan higher than the previous day. The money industry association's interbank lending rate remained at 12 cents for both the morning and afternoon sessions.

### British Gold Notes Rise Alone

### Securities Foreign Stocks Still High; Domestic Debt Sold Off in Large Quantities; Impartial Observer Offers Impartial Commentary

Since this newspaper successively disclosed the manuscripts of Mr. Xin Wei Jian Ying and Mr. Xin An, it has aroused the interest of readers in the industry. Yesterday, a letter was received from Mr. Chi Ping, whose words were quite reasonable. Therefore, the original letter will be disclosed, and readers will wonder what their thoughts are. The original letter from Mr. Chi Ping reads:

"The organization of a modern nation, to sum up its outline, consists of people, administration, land, and currency. Among the four, currency is the major artery. There has never been a nation that could stand and last with an unsound currency. Our country, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, has long planned for the overall currency situation, so in the first year or two, it always stood within the legal price. This is enough to prove that the legal tender has a great power that cannot be shaken, and there is no doubt about it. Later, the war shifted westward, the ports were closed, and customs authority was destroyed. 'Joint Notes' and 'Hua Xing' were successively established, and those who plotted against us used currency to exchange currency and arbitrage foreign exchange, thus launching the initial stage of the bilateral economic war. The decline in the value of the currency against foreign currencies was a necessary measure. People, unaware of the decline in the value of the currency, became frightened and competed to hoard goods, buy gold, purchase drafts, and hide foreign stocks and real estate to escape the calculation of funds. They do not know that this kind of foolish action is both laughable and pitiful. Looking at the gold pound and the US dollar, before the war, every five US dollars could be exchanged for one gold pound. Now it is four dollars and two cents in London and three dollars and eighty-nine cents in New York, a considerable difference. However, this difference is not because the United Kingdom is unable to maintain it, but because maintaining it would benefit international investors. Therefore, for the sake of the United States, it is necessary to proceed cautiously. Our country's current currency policy has the same intention, and it is not that it is unable to maintain it at seven or eight pence or one shilling, because it is afraid of the Japanese's clever plundering, which would prolong their economic collapse. All Chinese people should recognize this point and engage in mass production to enrich national power during the European war. This is the only way. Now, before the end of the lunar year, speculators in Shanghai are hoarding goods, gold, foreign stocks, and drafts in large quantities, fearing that they will not be able to make a profit. They are creating groundless rumors to make the second batch of wealthy merchants continue to follow suit, causing the prices of everything to soar and people to panic, as if a great disaster is about to come. They do not know that the first batch of big speculators have already slowly withdrawn, making a great profit, while those who follow suit are still dreaming. Taking foreign stocks as an example, except for Kai Ping, Electricity, Tramway, Waterworks, and International Trust, which are on track and can be invested in, the most unconscious are Public Utility stocks, Rubber stocks, and Shipbuilding stocks. Public Utility stocks have a contract relationship with the Municipal Council and do not have generous interest. There is no reason for them to exceed the face value by more than one cent, so exceeding the face value by two or three times is unreasonable. The rise and fall of the company's assets should be calculated for silver company stocks, and the face value should not be forgotten and interest should be used for conversion. The value of shipbuilding stocks should be calculated according to the profit standard of the previous year. If it rises to four times, even if there is profit, it is self-inflicted. When settling accounts for rubber stocks, they are also calculated according to the face value in Chinese currency and not calculated according to the current value and market price because of exchange rate changes. The cheapest cost per pound is more than 13 cents (due to increased wages and income tax), and the most expensive is more than 25 cents. The current market price is the best, which is 38 cents as reported in the daily telegram, and the second best is only worth about 30 cents, and there is a fixed limit on shipments, which are sold by a general company. If the average sales proceeds of last year are calculated with the current market price, small rubber stocks can yield 2% interest, medium rubber stocks can yield 4% interest, and large rubber stocks can yield 6% or 7% interest. Only two months remain this year, and there is a very long time to go. The changes in the situation are just beginning. If Willkie's trip to Europe is successful, then peace is in sight, and it is not impossible for the price of rubber to fall to 30 cents upon entry. The Japanese are actively advancing south, and the defense of the Far East is weak. If they are occupied, the danger at that time should also be considered. Looking at the market prices of six months ago and the current market prices, I know that those who are slightly clear about the economic situation must be surprised and sigh at how rare this is. In short, compared to the financial situation of the last European war, it was as high as nine shillings during the war and immediately dropped to about two shillings after the war. Once the war in the Far East ends, the legal price can undoubtedly be established immediately. If you want to exchange back the currency at that time, I know that the difference will be considerable. The wealthy merchants and those who follow suit now have to consider this carefully."

Yesterday's stock market at the Chamber of Commerce was very bullish again. Jardine Matheson, Union Wharf, and Steelworks shares saw new highs, and trading volume was huge. Although there was profit-taking, the selling pressure was not significant. Jardine Spinning shares rose to 39.5 yuan, and rubber shares remained strong.

Stock transactions: 200 shares of China International Trust Company were traded at 9.5 yuan, and another 200 shares were traded at 96 yuan, up more than 30 cents from before.

London, 21st—Today, the listed prices of British companies in the Far East were generally stable. Only HSBC shares continued to rise, with shares registered in the UK rising by 1.5 pounds to 87 pounds and shares registered in Hong Kong rising by 2 pounds to 90 pounds.

London, 21st—Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable, and there were no changes in the bonds across the board.

Gray market for securities: Yesterday's market situation suddenly changed. Because Deutfraco sold enthusiastically, about 700,000 to 800,000 shares, the market price suddenly felt unsustainable and fell sharply without any recovery. It was rumored that it was due to the expiration of bank loan periods and the calling in of goods, which shows that the economic situation is not as significant as political changes. Trading therefore suddenly increased, and funds therefore suddenly loosened. This kind of decline entirely belonged to the relationship between supply and demand and was not of great importance. Initially, domestic types led the way, and Deutfraco first sold off. Due to the buying of Tong Kang Shun Kang, a high price was opened. However, as Deutfraco's selling pressure became increasingly strong, even with the buying of Jiu Feng Lian He Tai Feng, the supply still exceeded demand besides Deutfraco's continuous sales, and Tian Sheng Shun Li Da Tong Yong Feng successively sold off. Type D fell the most severely, reaching slightly over 1.05 yuan, and the rest also fell by 30 to 65 cents uniformly. The total number of transactions was approximately 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

### Food Foreign Rice Retreats Slightly Rumors Pass, Market Stabilizes Large Consignments of Foreign Rice About to Arrive

After the rumors caused rice prices to soar the day before yesterday, they retreated yesterday, because foreign exchange was up, and the rumors of a maritime embargo were difficult to confirm. Speculative profiteers lost their opportunity to make mischief. In addition, local shops had limited capacity, so those holding goods had to sell them off at discounted prices. However, as the market weakened, visitors no longer wanted to buy. After the foreign rice market opened, wholesalers and retailers sold off, but the new wholesalers watched the small market and did not buy, and the countryside destinations also planned to wait and see before buying. Therefore, the prices of various types of rice gradually trended downward after they were quoted, and Saigon, Siamese, large and small grained, high and low grades of Tokyo rice all declined step by step, one and a half to two yuan less than the day before yesterday. However, in the afternoon, the suppliers did not sell at the low prices, and the wholesalers took the opportunity to buy, stabilizing the market. The early market for small-grained rice retreated slightly to 55.2 yuan. The afternoon market added 30 cents, but little was sold. No. 2 Saigon initially returned to 55.8 yuan and reached 56.2 yuan in the afternoon. No. 2 Siamese rice was 56 yuan, but no further sales were reported.

The national and foreign merchants had broader sales channels and no significant price fluctuations. The prices were as follows: Danyang 44 yuan, Liyang Special 45 yuan, Hong Kong White 45 yuan. In the gray market, the prices of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice were reported to have been slightly reduced, with no significant price fluctuations.

Yesterday, another 13,900 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai on the Tai Koo Company's Chongqing vessel from Hong Kong. It was rumored that a large batch of foreign rice would arrive in Shanghai, carried by five vessels dispatched by the German-Chinese Shipping Company specifically to Saigon and Rangoon. The first vessel, the Chibisa, was expected to arrive in Shanghai around Sunday of this week. The quantity was very large, and the exact number would be reported after the ship arrived.

### Flour Only Should Be Sold at Flat Prices Customer Sales Dependent on Returned Goods

The flour market was very quiet. According to investigations on this street, except for 7,500 bags of flat-price flour, the factories were unwilling to make many sacrifices. Customer sales were even less abundant, so those who needed goods still depended on returned goods. Therefore, the market for warehouse receipt flour, after weakening once the day before yesterday, reported firmness again. It was rumored that green cannon carriage export goods still required a high price of 16 yuan, and old carriage brands also required 14.67 yuan. Transactions were estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 bags, and the market was temporarily quiet.

The wheat market also reported calmness. The Chinese factories had not made any purchases for many days, and the Japanese factories and exporters also took a cautious approach, but the suppliers remained firm, unwilling to compromise. It was rumored that one or two truckloads of Su-Chang wheat were continuing to open, which this street still had to take care of. It was also rumored that the factories had also made a few transactions, and the market temporarily had no major changes.

### Yarn and Cotton Cotton Yarn Arbitrage Trading Suddenly Booms

The yarn market continued to rise, and the underlying trend felt increasingly stable. This was because the price of raw materials not only did not loosen but rose, and the factories had difficulty opening sales. Therefore, funds were insufficient to be distributed, and thoughts of going long became more concentrated. General arbitrage trading was unusually prosperous, but real demand remained depressed and had not developed. Once spot sales came, the market trended upward.

The opening price for spot yarn in the morning was 841 yuan for 20-count Double Horse yarn, down two or three yuan, because the overseas cotton market was flat and there was not much change in foreign exchange. The atmosphere inside the market was gentle. Once this price was opened, there were not many sellers, and those who were scalping instead came to pull in, and at the same time, many people hoped for higher prices. Therefore, the market price advanced step by step, all the way to 856 yuan. The statistics for transactions in half a day were 2,380 bales. The market for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 11 yuan. The amount of yarn purchased by each group is listed on the left:

Counterparts 2,320 Hong Kong 15

Wenzhou 20 Mainland 25

Total 2,380

### Japanese Yarn and Cloth Exports Increase Sharply

According to the latest customs report, the amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth exported from this port has suddenly increased sharply. The goods are mostly Japanese yarn and Japanese cloth. Cotton yarn is 80-count, 60-count, 42-count, and 40-count, with fine yarn accounting for more than 70% and coarse yarn accounting for 25%. The cotton cloth is 12-pound fine cloth and printed satin. The above yarn and cloth transactions were all ordered from Japanese trading companies and Japanese factories in Shanghai by India. The prices were all settled according to the gold pound market price of the day. The quantity of yarn is estimated at approximately 30,000 bales, and the quantity of cotton cloth is estimated at approximately 20,000 to 30,000 bales. The time limit is from December of the 28th year to January, February, March, and April of the 29th year, with shipments made in batches to India. It is inferred that the amount of yarn and cloth exported later will continue to increase.

### Factory Purchases Active Cotton Prices Difficult to Loosen

The cotton market remained strong, and the selling prices were very firm. Factory purchases were gradually active. The mentality in the industry was generally bullish. The supply from northern Jiangsu remained sporadic. 757 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock. Here is a list of spot cotton transactions:

Another report: overseas cotton market prices—the New York cotton market has been very sluggish and unusually quiet in recent days. Later, there were some Southern groups selling in the market and speculators active, and the market was weak. As a result, closing prices were slightly down one or two pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by more than one rupee. Egyptian cotton rose by seven or eight pounds. There was not much change in Liverpool.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market sentiment was quite good, and transactions were very quiet, but selling prices never loosened. Traders continued to buy cheaper cotton, but the factories were more subdued. Combining opinions from all parties, cotton prices are not expected to retreat at the moment. The factory prices converted at the US exchange rate of 6.875 yuan yesterday are as follows:

### Piece Goods Eastern Piece Goods Transactions Over a Thousand Pieces

The eastern cloth market continued to rise, because the mentality of the industry on this street was unusually bullish, short covering was strong, and new trading was strong. The current and futures transactions of fine cloth and fine twill in the market were over a thousand pieces. The current spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached a high of 27 yuan per piece and closed at 26.85 yuan. The futures for next month were trading at 27.85 yuan, and the market price required 28.25 yuan. The highest price of next month's futures for Four Gentlemen Serge also reached 8.25 cents per yard.

### Woolen Fabric Cargo Splitters Begin to Release New Styles

Yesterday's standard wool market remained high, resulting in a lack of actual sales. Most sellers in the industry adhered to the principle of selling out their existing inventory first, because although the current prices were rising frequently, the settlement price for new goods was still less than half of the cost, which shows the difficulty of doing business in the future. Cargo splitters were releasing new samples, distributing them to various tailoring groups. Because the foreign samples were collected very early, the release was also early. The prices per yard mostly increased by 20% to 30%. For example, Allied and Shepherd textiles were sold for 59.5 yuan per yard, 14.5 yuan more expensive per yard than last year.

### Oil Market Soybean Oil Fails to Rise in Actual Sales Peanut Oil Also Weak

Yesterday's soybean oil market: due to the failure of actual sales for the past two days, warehouse owners saw the situation was not good and abandoned manipulation, causing market sentiment to collapse. The market price fell by two or three yuan compared to the previous day. Only 90 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded in the overall market at prices of 116.5 yuan and 117 yuan. 60 barrels of Hankou oil were traded at a price of 115 yuan. 50 barrels of Jiangbei oil were traded at a price of 114.5 yuan. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 83 yuan. Peanut oil exporters were also watching, so the trend was also weak, and the market price turned down. Only 500 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 89 yuan, and 200 pieces of road freight were traded at a price of 90 yuan.

### Sugar Market Green Sugar Rises by 1.5 Yuan

Yesterday's report from the source said that Dutch coarse white sugar was 9.80 guilders according to the C.I.F.K.G. rate. The Shanghai Association's market price loosened slightly. The current spot price of 24 coarse white was a little over 50. The warehouse price was 62 yuan, the newly arrived warehouse price was 62.20 to 62.22 yuan, the old price was 61.80 to 61.85 yuan, and the transit price was still 49 yuan. Tai Koo's car white sugar was a little over 20 or 30, West Warehouse B mark was 60.80 to 61.30 yuan, East Warehouse was 62 yuan, and H mark car red sugar was a little over 50, from 45 yuan to 44.5 yuan. Dutch red sugar, local cotton white sugar, and local rock sugar were unchanged. China Sugar: A Jian group opened 130 bags of Green Sugar at 46.5 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. Shantou group opened 40 bags of Ice Flower White sugar at 54.5 yuan.

### Silk and Tea Arrival of Green Tea Increases Sharply

Since the start of the war in eastern Zhejiang, the military authorities in Zhejiang Province, to reduce unnecessary sacrifices by merchants and civilians, have approved the settlement and release of most of the raw tea that had accumulated in Wenzhou and Ningbo. Therefore, the arrival of goods has been very strong this week. According to general estimates, the number is no less than 19,000 pieces. Tea factories have been opening for business recently to meet the needs of foreign firms.

### North-South Goods: Raw Peanuts Prices Rise Again

According to Qingdao reports yesterday, raw peanut prices have risen again due to foreign firms' purchasing activities. Over 13,000 bags were traded, with the spot price at 38 yuan. Peanut transactions also reached 3,000 bags, with Wangtai peanuts at 25 yuan and Gaomi peanuts at 27 yuan. Furthermore, reports from Xuzhou indicate a price increase of 3-4 yuan.

### Metals: All New Iron Products are Expensive

Due to the tightening of foreign exchange, various metal goods are increasing in price. Local merchants find it difficult to avoid significant impacts. Current market asking prices are half to one and two tenths higher than the "red plate" prices. For example, new pan yuan is sold at 55 yuan per dan, Xin Guangyang yuan is sold at 92 yuan per dan, new triangular iron is 52 yuan, foreign yuan head is 42 yuan, foreign square head is 42 yuan, and new steel plates are sold as follows: 2.5 li at 95 yuan per dan, 5 li at 67 yuan, 7.5 li at 62 yuan, 1 to 1.5 fen at 57 yuan, and 2 fen and thicker at 52 yuan.

### Sundries: Xiamen Oranges Continue to Arrive, but Prices Remain High

Oranges are most edible. Orange peel, dried tangerine peel, orange pith, and orange albedo are all suitable for consumption. Moreover, orange pulp is rich in Vitamin C, and orange juice is sweet and delicious. Now, to increase resistance to toxins, it is common to use Vitamin C, which is similarly found in orange juice. However, this year's orange pith is very expensive, as reported previously. But arrivals are very strong. Yesterday, another 8,642 boxes of Xiamen oranges arrived, so market prices are expected to fall.

Commentary

### No Need to Follow

— Fu Yong

According to various sources, gambling dens in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Road area have received notices to close by the end of this month. This is the first step in the formal implementation of the "Western District Agreement." While it may not be "overwhelmingly popular," at least the Shanghai West area, which has been "bad" for nearly two years, will no longer see "paradise" or "entertainment venue"-style scams.

Of course, the "special individuals" who "make a living from this" will definitely not give up. Under their diligent "activities" and "maneuvering," the Nanshi area will succeed Shanghai West as the "second bad place." All harmful, sinister dens are busily preparing and arranging to take advantage of an even more powerful backing to "grandly open for business" once again.

If it doesn't come from the west, it comes from the south. It's the same old thing for the gambling den bosses. But what about the patrons who "pay tribute" with the price of their hard-earned money? Are they also thinking of gambling in the south if they can't gamble in the west, and creating more moving and tragic stories for the social news pages?

We don't need to bring up many stories of embezzlement or suicide by hanging, because every patron's motto is "everyone knows how to gamble, but each has different skills." They believe they won't end up like those people, driven to desperation. However, "relocating" requires fees, "protection" requires salaries, car service costs money, fruit and cigarettes aren't free, and the ultimate "backer" requires huge commissions. Under such enormous expenses, "skill" is already someone else's magic weapon.

Don't gamble! No need to follow!

### Can't Buy Coal Briquettes, Let Alone "Fair Price" Coal Briquettes

— A certain person

Since the price of coal briquettes rose to seven yuan per dan, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association specially entrusted 18 coal briquette factories, including Yitaixing, to sell at a fair price. Although the selling price was still 5.80 yuan per dan, it was still an exciting piece of news.

However, this fair-price sale method does not reduce the suffering of citizens, but instead adds many troubles. Most families of the salaried class buy one dan to burn one dan, and they all get it from nearby coal shops. This time, the fair-price sale was limited to 18 coal briquette factories, and coal shops did not receive any of the fair-price coal briquettes, so all the large and small coal shops were unable to supply the market. Even if they had inventory, most of them could not sell at the fair price of 5.80 yuan due to cost considerations, cutting off their customers. The 18 coal briquette factories, although stipulated to be open from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM, most of them were already out of stock by noon.

Therefore, in addition to "group coal purchases" and "strict punishment of hoarding" being promptly implemented and strictly enforced, during this period of transition, the method of selling coal briquettes at a fair price should be improved. Otherwise, the Coal Briquette Trade Association will not only waste its efforts, but will also appear to be deliberately using "fair-price sales" as a means of gaining fame and reputation.

We believe that in addition to the 18 coal briquette factories, perhaps due to procedural issues, not every coal shop can be assigned fair-price goods. At least, based on the concentration of residences, divide them into several districts, and assign several fair-price coal briquettes to several coal shops in each district, because with the daily demand for coal briquettes in the city, 18 coal briquette factories will definitely not be able to cope. Secondly, increase the quantity as much as possible, and secretly send people to investigate whether each factory is underreporting its production or whether there are still hidden deals to raise prices.

In short, like selling flour at a fair price, dealing with things superficially is of no help in practice, but instead creates more malpractices. Please everyone put in a little effort to do things, and also please everyone have a conscience when doing business.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 21: Blending Economics with Fiber, Using Machinery to Aid Writing

Let's talk about Ye Jinfen's father, who came up with this idea to help Jiang Jingrong. Originally, the Ye family were from Hangzhou, and they were a capitalist class. They opened a silk shop in Hangzhou, and later opened another silk shop in Shanghai. In the past, silk fabrics in China were mainly produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and among Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the silk fabrics produced in Suzhou in Jiangsu province and Hangzhou in Zhejiang province were the most famous and valuable. Those silk satin and gauze have always been woven with wooden looms. The patterns are indeed being updated, but the weaving methods are still the same old ones. They never opened any factories, but simply distributed the raw materials to each weaving household, who took them home to weave and then sent them back. These weaving households were often distributed inside and outside the cities of Suzhou and Hangzhou. However, as world transportation became increasingly frequent, all foreign products gradually sold in China. Silk fabrics were also like this. Products from England, France, Germany, Italy, and even Japan and India were all dumped in China. Because China has a large population and a large market, and Chinese people like novelty and showing off, they rush to buy those imported goods, which are bright in color and novel in pattern. This human love of novelty and curiosity cannot be stopped, unless you don't allow them to be imported, but that can't be done either. However, China's inherent silk fabrics have been greatly affected by it. The ancient sage said that when you are poor, you change; when you change, you get through. This is an unchanging principle. So you have to improve your inherent silk fabrics. You must cater to current tastes and no longer stick to old methods. Therefore, wooden looms are gradually being changed to iron looms; what used to be distributed to each weaving household is now concentrated in one place; those who never set up factories in the past are now setting up factories. Ye Songfen's father was an improver of silk fabrics. He first set up a silk weaving factory in Hangzhou, improved many silk fabrics, and achieved great results. Later, he set up another silk weaving factory in Shanghai, and is currently expanding it, wanting to set up a branch factory, so he had to train some talents in the textile industry. Ye Songfen is like Jiang Jingrong, he is an only son, but Jiang Jingrong has two younger sisters, while he has two older sisters. His eldest sister is already married, and his second sister is still studying at a girls' school. And like Jiang Jingrong, he is also thirteen years old this year, but Jiang Jingrong's birthday is in the first half of the year, while his is in the second half of the year. The next day, Ye Songfen discussed his father's idea with Jiang Jingrong. Jiang Jingrong said, "Then don't I have to live in your factory? Originally, when I came back from selling newspapers, I could still help Mom do things, and I could also teach my younger sisters to read. Wouldn't this all be unsuccessful?" (241)

### The Problem of Elementary School Students Eating Snacks

— Xin Liang

Every elementary school student, I can say here very definitely and certainly, there is not one who does not like to eat snacks. The money they ask their parents for is probably used to buy things like coffee candy, bubble gum, chicken cakes, heart-piercing biscuits, etc. And no matter what time, whether it is a good time to go to school in the morning, a good time to finish lunch at noon, or a good time to get out of school in the evening, as long as they have money with them, as long as their mouths are empty, they are happy to crowd into the "vending department" attached to the school, or go to those sugar stalls outside the school gate to buy food to eat.

The result of eating snacks, needless to say, is of course not beneficial at all. First, it is wasteful, and third, eating snacks can also cause children to develop a kind of gastrointestinal disease. Children often have stomachaches, and most of the reason is probably because they eat too many snacks.

For the sake of saving money, for the sake of protecting the studies and health of our children, I think the problem of elementary school students eating snacks is indeed worth discussing here.

My personal opinion is that in order to prohibit elementary school students from eating snacks, the school authorities and parents should bear joint responsibility. Below are a few scattered articles. Dear readers, please feel free to discuss them.

(1) On the school side:

A: The "vending department" can only sell books and other school supplies, and absolutely not sell snacks such as candy and biscuits.

B: Students who bring snacks to school to eat should be punished by the school, such as being fined for copying books, writing characters, etc.

C: Teachers should often tell students about the harms of eating snacks.

(2) On the parents' side:

A: As parents, you absolutely should not give money to your children to eat snacks. You must know that this kind of giving money cannot be considered love. Protecting your children's studies and health is even more important.

B: As parents, you should prepare a piggy bank or "saving box" to cultivate a habit of thrift in your children.

### Managers and Junior Staff

— Simon

According to reports: The deputy manager of ×× company, usually looks down on junior staff, is very arrogant, and often loses his temper. As a result, the staff in his department have very bad relations with him. When they could no longer bear it, they jointly sent a letter to the board of directors, listing six major offenses. But it aroused the manager's dissatisfaction, who considered it an insult and hired a lawyer to sue in court.

Let's put aside for the moment the question of who is right and who is wrong in this matter, and how the court will rule. But in fact, managers, with a few exceptions, are often arrogant, bad-tempered, and look down on junior staff, scolding them when they want to. People who have been junior staff have probably all tasted this flavor, right? In fact, managers do less work every day than junior staff and get paid more. Junior staff, on the other hand, work non-stop all day long and get only a small amount of salary. Their year-round labor is for the manager's benefit. If there were no junior staff, the manager probably wouldn't be able to do all the work, and their high salary would have nowhere to come from.

As the saying goes: No matter how good the peony is, it needs the support of the leaves. Although managers have extraordinary talent, without junior staff to serve him and do his work, I'm afraid no business can develop. There is indeed a distinction between managers and junior staff in terms of position, but in terms of occupation, managers and junior staff have the same contribution to social undertakings.

Therefore, for any business to succeed, managers should understand that junior staff also have a share of the credit, and it is not something they have achieved single-handedly. If they understand this point, then not only should they not look down on junior staff, but they should also sympathize with them for their heavy workload and meager salaries, and often provide comfort in spirit, and never put on airs as managers. If they can do this, even if junior staff have a difficult life, they will no longer discriminate against the manager, and their work efficiency will increase instead.

### Textbooks: Reduced Size

— Ji Fufang

I heard that major bookstores are preparing to reduce the size of elementary school textbooks by half starting next semester to save paper and prevent book prices from becoming too expensive. As for middle school textbooks, there are no longer any high-quality editions using Daolin paper. They are all printed on newspaper. I don't know if this can reduce the selling price.

### Movie Stars in Shadow City are Eager to Learn

— Hua Zhi

Hollywood movie stars who aspire to advance are studying hard while filming, and are very self-disciplined.

For example, Jimmy Cagney, he was originally a medical school student and wanted to be a doctor, but because his family was poor, he dropped out of school and went into movies. He is currently saving money to continue his studies.

Miss Olivia de Havilland, she graduated from a music school with honors. Although she is good at performing tragedies on the screen, she continues to study music and is preparing to become a professional pianist soon.

Spencer Tracy, who won the Academy Award for Film Arts last year, studied at Marquette University and hoped to become a lawyer after graduation. As a result, he entered the film industry due to economic pressure. Now he is still studying law on his own.

Betty Davis, the master of tragedy, was originally a top student at Garrison Professional School, specializing in history. Once, because her romance with a male classmate broke down, she angrily entered the screen. Now she feels that life is very monotonous and is also reviewing ancient books.

There are also the beautiful Priscilla Lane and her two sisters. They are all college students and take a study abroad approach. Before entering Hollywood, they traveled around with dance troupes and audited courses at various universities when they had time, regretting that they could not complete a full degree program. Now she is also tutoring in her spare time.

The luckiest one can be said to be child star Shirley Temple, who is still of school age. Fox Company hired many teachers to teach her. Among the teachers, there are those who are knowledgeable and those who are knowledgeable about current affairs, artists, and writers, all kinds of people. I'm just afraid she doesn't have time to study. Compared to others who dropped out of school, she is truly a darling of heaven.

### Pinocchio Goes to the Bottom of the Sea to Find His Father

Movie Story

### The Adventures of Pinocchio

— Translated by Ivan

Searching for His Father at the Bottom of the Sea

Pinocchio Goes to the Bottom of the Sea to Find His Father

In the midst of the wind and clouds, they flew all night long. When the sun returned to the earth, they came to a cliff. The sea roared below, and the surging waves were like a busy giant. Here they said goodbye to the pigeons. Pinocchio tied a piece of yellow stone to the donkey's tail, and he and Jiminy jumped down and sank straight to the bottom of the sea. The sea kingdom is really a wonderful place, with all kinds of fish and all kinds of seaweed and coral. But Pinocchio was determined to find his father and had no intention of looking at this spectacle. He bumped east, asked west, and searched the bottom of the sea, but he couldn't find the sea monster whale. He shouted loudly, "Father! Father!" But the only answer was his own echo.

Not far from here, a deserted island was floating on the surface of the sea. This is the sea monster who is dozing off. In the depths of his throat lives a poor old man, the pitiful old Geppetto. He and the kitten Figaro and the goldfish Cleo have been without food for several days. They all hope that the whale king will wake up and swallow some fish so that they can continue their dark days for a few more days. Pinocchio's loud shouts woke up the sea monster, who opened his mouth wide and sucked a Sally-like wooden idol into his mouth. But he left the cricket still floating on the sea. (9)

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Amusing Story of a Certain Prince Performing a Show to Raise Money (Part 2)

It happened to be the end of the year and the creditors were pressing on the prince's door. The prince could only sigh and block them out. A certain righteous actor heard about this and said to his colleagues, "The prince used to spend money and see money, and he was very close to our Pear Garden line. He didn't put on any princely airs at all. Moreover, no matter what kind of performance was held in the prince's mansion, (he always spoke well for us in front of his family. Therefore, we earned a lot of money from him (the prince often served as the director of the show), so we can't ignore him in this difficult situation. Why don't we all put on a show to raise money and invite the prince to join in the performance? On the surface, we're helping others, but in reality, all the money we earn will go to him." Everyone agreed when they heard this. That day, the theater was full. Logically, after deducting the expenses for the front stage and the band, there could be a surplus of several hundred yuan, which could be used to tide over the New Year comfortably. Who knew that although the prince was poor, his style when he went out was still about the same as before. Moreover, he had good relationships with people, and people in the backstage had always received benefits from him. When he stepped into the backstage, he was still dressed neatly, with a servant carrying his white flag costume bag behind him, without any sign of poverty. So, bowing and greeting were still as warm as before. After the prince finished his performance, the backstage crew was busy taking off his makeup, taking off his boots, and serving him attentively. Of course, it was the same as before, and the words of hard work and compliments were even more lively than before. He was so happy in his heart that he committed the extravagant habit of a young master again and forgot all about his family's poverty. So he distributed all the money he had earned as rewards. The supporting actors got thirty or fifty yuan, and the box managers and servants got ten or eight yuan. In a short while, all the money was used up. When he came out of the backstage, he saw a group of creditors coming up to him. These people came with great hope, but they didn't expect to get a single penny. The prince could only cough and sigh as he walked, and the creditors followed dejectedly. The show to raise money that they had pinned their hopes on was sung in vain. (185)

### "A Sky Full of Stars" Completed Filming

— Nan Lin

"China Electric" Location Shooting Team Leaves Kunming for Chongqing

(Kunming Airline News) The "China Electric" location shooting team of thirty-eight people, led by the business section chief Li Gongge, left Chongqing for Kunming in October last year and immediately began shooting location scenes. Apart from a few days when the work was suspended due to illness, they were working hard every day. The main task of the team in Kunming this time was to shoot location scenes for "A Sky Full of Stars," followed by the "China Electric" troupe's public performance. This was the first time the troupe had performed in Kunming. On December 12 last year, the troupe gave its first public performance of the four-act play "Frontier Storm," written by Yang Hansheng and directed by Shen Xida, at the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Street. It was performed every night at 7:30 PM for several days, and the box office was quite successful. Then they performed "Demons Run Wild," written by Chen Baichen and directed by Sun Yu. The performance of this play was very good, full of tragicomic humor and satire, and was very popular with the audience. The troupe also donated all the proceeds from one day's ticket sales, after deducting expenses, to the Air Defense Command to cover air defense expenses.

In addition to shooting location scenes for "A Sky Full of Stars" and performing plays, the team also filmed a newsreel of the Yunnan Army's expedition on the spot. The content was quite magnificent. The team stayed in Kunming for three and a half months, and all the personnel left Kunming for Chongqing on July 30. The location shooting for "A Sky Full of Stars" was also completed.

### Wu Mei at Meilongzhen

— Hua

The Shanghai Drama Society is going to revive "Women's Apartment." Wu Mei plays the landlady of the women's apartment in "Women's Apartment," and she is successful. In later performances of "Women's Apartment," she always played the landlady. When Yihua Company adapted "Women's Apartment" into a movie, director Chen Yunran also asked someone to ask her to play the landlady as a guest star, but she was busy with other things at the time and did not agree. But the nickname of landlady has been added to her head, and it is "old brand."

Recently, she and a few friends have jointly opened the Meilongzhen Restaurant on Weihai Road. She personally goes to the Xiaocai Market on Sima Road at 5:00 in the morning every day to buy food, and she takes care of the affairs in the store in the afternoon. When friends from the drama troupe come to the town for a short stay, she always asks for their opinions on snacks and dishes, just like she asks for criticism when she is acting.

Wu Mei is really practicing being a landlady, but she still hasn't forgotten the drama she loves. Now she is busy rehearsing "Guilian" every night. The Drama Society's revival of "Women's Apartment" may also take time to play the landlady again.
