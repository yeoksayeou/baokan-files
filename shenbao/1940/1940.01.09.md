Editorial

### The Significance of the United States Building a Large Navy

During the US Congressional session, a noteworthy piece of news is that key members of the Naval Affairs Committee have requested Congress to allocate US$2 billion to strengthen the US Atlantic Fleet. It is said that this opinion represents the view of the majority in Congress, and the reasons for this request are: (1) The world crisis is becoming increasingly serious, and in order to ensure the security of the Latin American republics and avoid possible foreign aggression, the United States needs to strengthen its national defense. (2) If the United States wants to avoid a world war, it must have sufficient strength to ensure the security of the New World. Whether in the Pacific or the Atlantic, it needs a fleet with sufficient defense capabilities. The United States already has a naval strength of 2 million tons in the Pacific, so it needs at least two-thirds of that strength in the Atlantic to be able to undertake defense. (3) In the past, there was an "unwritten" understanding between Britain and the United States, that is, Britain's strong naval strength was the first line of defense in the Atlantic, while the United States' strong navy was the first line of defense in the Pacific. But because Britain is currently preoccupied with affairs in Europe, it is naturally impossible for Britain to fulfill its past mission in the Atlantic, and the future changes in the situation are even more unpredictable. Another factor that makes it necessary for the United States to increase its Atlantic Fleet is the threat of a European naval power joining forces with an Asian naval power against the United States. It is impossible to speculate which country is being referred to as the European naval power, but the so-called Asian naval power is undoubtedly Japan.

Since this massive naval construction program was initiated by the US Congress, whether it can be decided by the committee and then passed in Congress remains to be seen. Judging from the current policy of the US administrative authorities, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt was already prominent during his tenure as Under Secretary of the Navy. He has always advocated a large naval policy and wants to make the US Navy the strongest force in the world whenever he has the opportunity. Since he took office as president, there have already been several naval expansion plans. In 1933, he allocated an emergency fund of US$238,000,000 to build 32 warships, the last batch of which was completed in 1938. In the Vinson-Trammell Act of 1934, the US Congress passed legislation allowing the US to build ships to the maximum limit allowed by the Washington Naval Treaty. Under this act, the US planned to build 94 warships, of which 45 have been completed and are in service, while the other 45 are under construction. The 1938 naval expansion act also provided for the construction of 34 warships, but they will not be completed until at least 1944. Therefore, since Roosevelt took office in 1933, a total of 179 warships are scheduled to be built, of which only 89 have been completed, and 90 are still under construction.

Now, if the United States wants to further expand its Atlantic Fleet, and its standard is to achieve that its navy in the two oceans can operate independently and overwhelm other countries in the world, then it is estimated that this US$2 billion naval expansion military expenditure can build 12 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 17 heavy cruisers, 18 light cruisers, 36 destroyers and submarines each, and 53 auxiliary fleets. Taking the average annual output rate of 15 ships from the US shipbuilding industry, it will take at least ten years to complete the construction of the Atlantic's vast naval fleet. The main enemy of the United States is enough to threaten the safety of the United States; judging from what the key members of the Naval Affairs Committee said, it can be said that it is not a European, but an Asian naval power. This Asian naval power has long been carrying out aggression against China. If this aggression does not stop, and the United States continues to supply this naval power with raw materials and fuel its arrogance, or even worse, as one US newspaper pointed out, "Japan may use China as a large arsenal and manpower reserve in the future, which will be harmful to Western civilization," then by that time, even if the United States has a large navy that looks down on everything, it may not be able to cope with the threat that this aggressive country has added to the United States itself.

It will take ten years to complete this naval expansion case. Although it does not have the feeling of quenching a thirst with distant water for the recent threat, its necessity and value will certainly not be reduced due to ten years. But at the same time, we are grateful to the current United States for its material and moral strength, which, as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui said, has a decisive impact on the fate of the Far East. And now is also the most appropriate time to unleash such a great weapon. Looking back since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Japan has purchased from the United States US$326 million worth of major combat materials, such as gasoline, scrap iron, copper, automobiles, and airplanes. Japanese goods imported into the United States, just in the eight months before the European war last year, averaged US$39.4 million a month. After the European war, the increase was even greater, averaging US$79 million per month. Japan's international balance of payments relies on trade with the United States for funding, which is not small. In an instant, the US-Japan Commercial Treaty will expire. If the US congressmen in session carefully consider how to use this new weapon, prohibit the export of all military supplies, and do not grant preferential treatment to trade after the non-renewal of the treaty, then the effect of stopping the aggression and the future security of the United States will not be less than the construction of a huge warship. Saving a large amount of naval expenses is just the rest!

### More Than Half of the Japanese House of Representatives Members; Participate in the Movement to Overthrow the Cabinet; Prime Minister Abe Is Extremely Anxious; Seeks Understanding from the Leaders of the Five Parties; The Cabinet Approves the Basic Policy of the Puppet Regime

Tokyo: The Nichinichi Shimbun reported today that, according to the Anti-Government Movement Committee, 276 of the 448 members of the House of Representatives have signed the anti-government resolution. Therefore, the Prime Minister is now taking a cautious attitude towards the political situation, especially since the Diet will be reconvened on January 21. However, judging from the situation in all aspects, the Prime Minister seems to have the determination to proceed with resolving the China Incident, because he has declared that this is the mission entrusted to his cabinet. The newspaper also said that Prime Minister Abe proposed to invite the leaders of the five political parties to his official residence on January 10 to explain his plan to resolve the China Incident and the basic conditions for establishing a "New Central Government" in order to seek their cooperation.

Tokyo: The Japanese government is scheduled to hold a temporary cabinet meeting today to formally decide on the basic policy for the new government in China in order to complete domestic procedures. Before the temporary cabinet meeting is held, the government intends to convene a temporary Privy Council to explain the contents of the basic policy, and explain it to the leaders of the five political parties to seek understanding. Prime Minister Abe will actively strive to resolve the anti-government movement of the members of the House of Representatives from various factions in order to sweep away the uneasy atmosphere in the political situation. There is an extreme opinion in the cabinet that when the government convenes a five-party summit to explain the countermeasures for the new government in China, it should take this opportunity to carry out work on political parties. The Prime Minister is afraid that this move will not be without the danger of provoking political parties. On the 7th, he discussed with Internal Affairs Minister Ohara and sent Secretary-General Endo to the private residence of Navy Minister Yoshida to seek his opinion. In short, it is noteworthy whether the five-party summit, which will be held on the afternoon of the 10th with the purpose of explaining the basic policy for the new government in China, can serve as an opportunity to transform the political situation.

### US Demands on Japan; No Retreat; US Army and Navy Daily; Comments on US-Japan Commercial Treaty Negotiations

Even if there is a change, it is only a nominal change. Regarding the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the reporters believed it was clear in the Konoe Declaration, but the spokesman actually said that the Konoe Declaration was nothing more than a political trick (Eighth United Press Dispatch)

Beijing: The Japanese spokesman here claimed today that even if the New Central Regime to be established is established, the status of the North China regime will remain the same as it is now. The Japanese troops in North China now feel that they must assist in the formation of the new regime. The possibility of the withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in China is at least not possible at present. The Mongolian regime and the North China regime will both formulate a special status under the new regime. Jingwei is now trying to make the Chinese people understand that he can handle the overall situation alone, so I, such as refuting it, and saying that Jingwei cannot survive without the Japanese army, then it is close to interference.

In the past, the reasons for the replacement of some important cabinet members, such as former Foreign Secretary Eden, former Naval Secretary Duff Cooper, and even former Foreign Secretary Hoare, were well known to the public. Only this time, Hore-Belisha's departure is mysterious. It is only known that the Prime Minister once asked Hore-Belisha to change to the post of Minister of Commerce, but Hore-Belisha replied that he would rather retire. Political figures all said that Hore-Belisha had already made many contributions to the reorganization of the army during his tenure as Secretary of War, and was therefore deeply loved by the people. It is difficult to understand why the Prime Minister wanted to transfer him to another position. It is said that the Prime Minister once told Hore-Belisha that there were "certain prejudices" about his continued appointment as Secretary of War. Although I don't think so, I also think it is better to try to adapt to the environment. Up to this day, Hore-Belisha has already resigned, and it is said that the Prime Minister still hopes that after careful consideration, he can still take the post of Minister of Commerce. In addition, it is also said that the Prime Minister plans to consult with the leaders of the opposition parties this week on the change of cabinet members. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

London - The newly appointed Minister of Commerce Sir Duncan and Minister of Information Sir Lease took office this morning. In addition, Osborne, the director of the News Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information, is a retired naval lieutenant general, who was recently entrusted by the Admiralty to supervise the construction of special warships, so he resigned from his post today in order to devote himself to shipbuilding. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

London - A Reuters correspondent in the National Assembly stated that political figures in London now believe that Hore-Belisha, who resigned as Secretary of War last Friday, will return to a government position in a short period of time. It is said that Belisha has decided to speak in person when the National Assembly reopens on January 16, following National Assembly conventions, at the end of the questioning period. The various reforms implemented by Belisha during his tenure, and the harmony of political views between Belisha and Prime Minister Chamberlain, can be seen from the already published correspondence between the two, which has led newspapers to conclude that the change of Secretary of War is not a harbinger of a change in policy. The comments of The Times on this matter on Sunday can represent the general interest of the English people. It said, "The authorities do not intend to change the policy, and Belisha's achievements deserve the recognition of the general public, and no one has given more recognition and support than the Prime Minister. His greatest achievement is the entire difficult problem of army expansion, which is now proceeding smoothly and being resolved in accordance with a consensus-approved plan. The adoption of a compulsory military service system, the systematic conscription of soldiers, the arrangement of supplies, and large-scale training, all of these plans, like the reforms we have already mentioned, are definite victories that the successor Secretary of War cannot lose." (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Berlin - This morning, German newspapers unanimously believed that Belisha was a Jew and was therefore excluded from the British cabinet, but there is no doubt that his latent power will still be active behind the scenes of the political stage. The People's Observer stated, "The operational burden borne by the United Kingdom is becoming heavier and heavier. (Omission) British Jews believe that Belisha should retire." The German "One Week One Newspaper" stated, "Belisha's resignation will not change the British political system, only the strategy will change. After Belisha withdraws from the British cabinet, he can continue to carry out anti-German policies in secret." (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

London - Mr. Belisha, who resigned as Secretary of War last week, bid farewell to his colleagues in the War Office today. A Reuters correspondent in the National Assembly learned that the Prime Minister has no intention of convening the National Assembly early to discuss the resignation of the Secretary of War. The leader of the Labor Party is very worried that the resignation of Belisha will interrupt several of the reforms he initiated during his tenure. However, the resolutions on these reforms were approved by the entire government, not just by individuals, so there will be no major changes. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

However, after the government authorities consoled them, they have now returned to peace and tranquility. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 7th)

### Internal Strife Occurs in Indian National Congress; Gandhi Announces the Split of the Two Factions

Bombay - Gandhi published an article in his Harijan newspaper today, saying that the National Congress now has signs of disintegration.

The situation in Bencherby is also not good. He continued, "I hope that they can correct themselves. Otherwise, I cannot lead an undisciplined army to victory." New elections are currently underway. The choices of National Congress members are unrestricted. They can allow young people to come forward and take over everything.

### No Developments on the Finnish-Soviet Front; Fighting Trending Toward Salla; Artillery Battles Unceasing in Areas Like Käkisalmi and the Karelian Isthmus; Finland Broadcasts an Appeal, Vowing Never to Cease Resistance

Helsinki: The Finnish government announced in a communiqué last night that 300 Soviet snow reconnaissance troops attempted to break through Finnish lines near Salla on Saturday and were all killed. Twelve Soviet aircraft were also shot down. Near Lake Hatchenlahti, Soviet forces fiercely attacked Finnish positions for two days, but the Finns resisted staunchly, and the Soviets have retreated to their original positions. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Helsinki: The battle on the Salla front has been stalemated for 11 days. Today, the weather is severely cold, with temperatures dropping to minus 40 degrees Celsius, but the situation has not eased. Heavy artillery battles continue, even more intense than the fighting near Suomussalmi. Reports from various sources indicate that many Finnish and Soviet soldiers are freezing to death. It is estimated that more are dying from the cold than from bullets. It is difficult to transport the wounded to safety, and the dead must be retrieved from the front lines after several days due to the thick snow. Finnish 5-ton and 7-ton tanks have been withdrawn to the rear, while Soviet tanks are better suited to sub-zero temperatures and can serve as the spearhead of the Soviet offensive. (Haitong Press dispatch, 8th)

Helsinki: Finland broadcast an appeal last night, stating, "We may be defeated by force, but unless we are all annihilated, our resistance will never cease." (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Helsinki: General Headquarters issued a war report: (1) On the Karelian Isthmus, artillery batteries from both sides continue to bombard each other. One infantry supply column from the Red Army was ambushed and routed by our forces. Currently, Red Army soldiers on the front lines are digging trenches and laying barbed wire and obstacles, suggesting they intend to wait until the weather warms before launching a major offensive. (2) On the eastern front, northeast of Lake Tuutajärvi, our forces have further consolidated their original positions. The Red Army attacked the town of Ilomantsi at noon yesterday but was repulsed by our forces, losing one tank. In the Suomussalmi area, fighting continues. The war is now trending towards the Salla area in the north. (3) At the northern port of Petsamo, a large-scale Red Army attack was repulsed. Our patrol units are very active. (4) Soviet warships were not very active yesterday, only attempting to prevent our merchant ships from leaving various ports and protecting Soviet maritime communication lines. Our coastal artillery at the port of Koivisto and along Lake Ladoga was quite active. (5) Soviet aircraft flew to Lahti, Kouvola, and other cities yesterday, dropping bombs. Material damage was minimal. Our air force flew to the front lines and bombed enemy positions. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

Stockholm: A report received yesterday afternoon from Petsamo stated that several large Soviet units have been surrounded by Finnish forces. There is a possibility that the Soviet forces in the northeastern corner of the battle lines will be annihilated. Another report from Suomussalmi stated that although the weather is cold, the fighting has not slackened. As of yesterday afternoon, the outcome was still undecided. Finnish forces hope to achieve victory in the Salla area, but fierce fighting continues due to the arrival of Soviet reinforcements. It has been confirmed that the Finnish commander who defeated the Soviet 163rd Division is General Tuompo. Tuompo directly receives orders from the Finnish Commander-in-Chief. The Soviet offensive in the Salla area clearly aims to directly threaten Rovaniemi, a key railway hub. (Haitong Press dispatch, 8th)

Helsinki: According to news from here today, the sky over the Karelian Isthmus is filled with thick clouds and fog, with sleet falling, and temperatures are extremely low. Therefore, apart from artillery battles, there is no other activity. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Residents of Helsinki Returning in Droves

Helsinki: Since the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet conflict, many residents who evacuated from the Finnish capital of Helsinki are now returning. Finnish authorities are greatly concerned. According to reports from here yesterday, the number of people who have already returned to Helsinki is approximately 45,000. Helsinki's current population is between 65,000 and 70,000. It is said that there are two reasons for residents returning to Helsinki: (1) Since the outbreak of the war, Soviet aircraft have only conducted bombing raids on Helsinki in formation in early December, and have been less active since then. (2) People who evacuated to the suburbs are suffering from the severe cold and are eager to return home. The Finnish authorities are concerned about the air raid danger and the problems of water, electricity, and fuel supply after the population increase. (Haitong Press dispatch, 8th)

Finnish Aircraft Fly to Soviet Union, Dropping Bibles

Stockholm: Finnish sources here claim that, according to Finnish pilots, they have repeatedly flown over Leningrad and dropped many abridged versions of the Bible. The Finns are also distributing the Bible in other ways, as they believe the Bible has a significant moral influence on the Red Army. The Finns are currently more optimistic, for three reasons: (1) It is now proven that Finnish air defenses are increasingly effective and are rapidly strengthening. (2) The entire eastern front, from the Arctic Ocean to Lake Ladoga, is defended by a smaller but highly mobile Finnish force against 360,000 Soviet troops. (3) The short southern line of the Karelian Isthmus is the most critical point, but despite the Soviet concentration of large forces in front of the Mannerheim Line, there is no hope of a successful advance.

### Three British Ships Lost; Captain of Marseille City Injured

London: The British ship Marseille City (8,317 tons) struck a mine off the coast of Scotland yesterday, causing a hole in the middle of the ship. One sailor died and 13 Indian sailors were injured. The ship carried 165 crew members. Minutes before the incident, a pilot from a pilot boat had boarded the ship for guidance. Just as the pilot boat had moved about 50 yards away from the ship, the ship struck a mine. Lifeboats were immediately lowered, but two capsized, causing about 14 people to fall into the water. Three of them climbed onto the rudder, while the rest were rescued by the pilot boat. The pilot boat later towed four lifeboats from the Marseille City, carrying about 40 crew members, into the harbor. A British aircraft, seeing the Marseille City in distress, immediately summoned a rescue ship to save people. The Marseille City was towed into the harbor last night. Apart from the two destroyed lifeboats, there was no significant damage on the surface, but the interior was heavily damaged. Captain Arlsen was injured in the mine explosion.

### Göring Wants to Make Germany a "Factory, Barracks, and Kitchen"—Slogan of German Wartime Economy

The Hague: The German wartime economy was recently placed entirely under the control of Hermann Göring, the dictator of the country's Four-Year Economic Plan. According to news from Berlin, Göring has decided to take various strict measures in a short period of time to further exploit resources. The slogan is to make Germany a "factory, barracks, and kitchen" and to use "iron and fire" to break through all obstacles. The important measures under consideration are as follows: (1) Department stores are gradually running out of stock, and since there is no way to replenish them in the future, it has been decided to order them to close. (2) Cash stored in banks by these stores will be confiscated by the state and exchanged for short-term or medium-term treasury bills, which is effectively a forced loan. (3) "Informally" prohibiting people from withdrawing more than 500 marks at a time from banks. (4) Issuing small-denomination treasury bills with a face value of 10 marks and 20 marks to be used as part of workers' wages. (5) Public canteens and the "People's Meal" system will be promoted as much as possible. Factories will provide food and accommodation for all employees. (6) Factories that manufacture various daily necessities will be strictly monitored by the state. Any surplus factories will be ordered to close. (7) Conducting a door-to-door inventory of clothing and shoes throughout the country to collect a large amount of old clothing and footwear for military use. (8) Reorganizing redundant agencies. (9) The party, government, and military must be thoroughly reorganized and redundant personnel eliminated. According to Göring's aides, the above measures will be implemented in a short period of time. This is the last card in Germany's domestic policy. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

### Churchill Arrives in France to Inspect British Troops; French Communiqué States Western Front Quiet

### Sun Ke Returns to China, Arrives in Chongqing, Discusses Impressions of Europe During Wartime; Public Opinion in Various Countries Expresses Sympathy for China, Praising the Resistance as Representing the Highest Human Civilization

Chongqing Airmail: Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, who was ordered to go to the Soviet Union in January of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) and visited various countries in Europe, returned to China from France after ten months. He recently arrived safely here by plane via Kunming and immediately visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for discussions. Yesterday morning, he attended the joint memorial service of the Central Government and the National Government to report on his impressions of the trip. A reporter recently interviewed President Sun at a certain place, and he shared his observations on various situations in Europe, many of which are favorable to the future of China's resistance. A brief record is as follows:

Among the European newspapers, the Soviet Union paid the most attention to China's resistance. Major and minor newspapers in the Soviet Union devoted many pages daily to reporting news of China's resistance, and always placed it in a prominent position. For example, when news of the great victory in northern Hunan reached the Soviet Union, all major newspapers published it in the most prominent position the next day. The previous speech by President Chiang Kai-shek at the People's Political Council was also published in full. However, there were fewer reports on China's news on September 16, 17, and 18, because the entire Soviet press was filled with news of the invasion of Poland on those days. Afterwards, it returned to the original state. The Soviet Union is very concerned about China's resistance. It is hoped that China's media will pay special attention to this point. The Soviet Union's sympathy and assistance to China's resistance should be cherished. The Soviet Union's view of the European situation is very clear. The Soviet Union's Far Eastern policy will not change.

The current situation in Britain and France after the start of the European war has many points that we can use as a reference. In cities in Britain and France, pedestrians gradually thin out on the streets after 5:00 PM. Blackouts are strictly enforced. Not only do shops not open or light up, but even street lights are all extinguished. When lighting is necessary indoors, thick curtains must be used for cover. After Britain declared war, a total of 150,000 soldiers were transported to the front in France. The transportation arrangements were very thorough, and no one was injured during the transport. However, in the early days of air defense, the number of people killed by cars on the roads at night reached more than 3,500 in a month nationwide. On the day Britain declared war on Germany, the Parliament was in session when an air raid siren sounded. All the members hastily took refuge in the air raid shelter. Who knew that half an hour later, it turned out to be a false alarm. According to the air defense headquarters, an aircraft of unknown nationality was initially discovered in the sky, but it was later determined to be a domestic aircraft. At the same time, because underground shelters were difficult to build in London, ordinary people had to hide in underground subway tunnels. However, sandbags had been piled up in front of the glass windows and doors of large shops.

The air defense situation in Paris is slightly different from that in London. Sandbags were not seen piled up in front of shops, only a large number were piled up around the Arc de Triomphe, intending to protect the sculptures and art. The streets of Paris are much quieter, and the number of customers in cafes has also decreased significantly compared to peacetime. Since there are no lights or pedestrians on the streets of London and Paris at night, the situation is not as good as that in Nanjing when the war first started.

At the beginning of the war, many measures in France showed considerable panic. The London Municipal Government ordered the requisition of more than 3,000 rooms in hotels throughout the city and evicted all the guests. After more than a month of war, many of the requisitioned rooms were left empty and unused, causing public outcry. However, the municipal government explained that its initial intention was that as soon as the war started, German aircraft would launch a major bombing raid, and London had to prepare 300,000 beds for rescue. Fortunately, Germany did not follow this plan. Once, German aircraft bombed a seaport near Edinburgh. Local residents saw a large number of British aircraft taking off and thought it was a British aircraft exercise, so the crowd gathered to watch. After a while, machine guns and bombs fell, and they realized that German aircraft were attacking, but the air defense department did not issue a warning, causing citizens to accuse them. The evacuation of people from London this time was very swift. More than one million children were evacuated in a few days. In the rural families near London, each family was seen fostering children separately, registering them with numbers. However, since the children fostered in other people's homes were not managed and could not study, the children fostered in each village formed groups and became an uncontrolled world of little angels. After the parents raised objections, the primary schools followed and dispersed to the countryside, and teachers went to and fro, grabbing three or five children to attend class and teaching them in turn. When the parents went to see the children on Sundays, the children cried and refused to stay in the countryside. The parents had no choice but to lead them back to the city. Therefore, all the people evacuated from London returned to the city after a month.

British public opinion's attitude towards this great war seems to be quite similar to the meaning of China's resistance. Once, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill made a broadcast speech, the wording of which was quite similar to the arguments made by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek since the start of the resistance. Afterwards, Sun Ke talked to Churchill, and Sun Ke said to him bluntly, "The wording of your broadcast a few days ago is exactly the same as what China has said and what Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has said in the past two years." Churchill replied, "Originally, the nature of our war this time is the same as yours, both resisting aggression." Lloyd George is now 78 years old. When he talked about the European situation, he was very dissatisfied with the British authorities in recent years, saying that this war was the result of the weakness of the authorities in recent years. He and Churchill both suggested to the government several years ago that Britain should actively help China's resistance. British public opinion and the backbone of society all admired China's resistance. They praised in unison, "China has fought for two and a half years, and Japan cannot swallow China. China has already won." The British feel that China is the only glorious and hopeful place in the world. Britain's continued maintenance of its Far Eastern policy is a creed shared by the government and society. Lloyd George also said, "China's resistance not only represents the forces of justice, but also represents the highest human civilization." Once, Sun Ke had dinner with a young noble. The young man, drunk, said that it was extremely boring to be British and that he would rather come to China to live and work. He had some skills: he had studied forest management and could also do carpentry. A third party valued our resistance to the victorious future so much. We should strengthen our confidence and strive to achieve its goal as soon as possible.

The wartime organization of European countries is not as perfect as most people imagine. Europeans are extremely tired of war. There is an old lady in France who is over 80 years old. She has personally witnessed three wars in her life. Her husband participated in the Franco-Prussian War, her son participated in the last Great War, and now her grandson is participating. An American reporter recently wrote a book advocating a world federal system. The main point is that if ten democratic countries in the world are united, they will not be afraid of violent aggression. Intellectual circles in European countries are very interested in this kind of speech. Europeans are afraid of war, saying that the source of war is that moral progress cannot keep up with the progress of material and scientific killing instruments. The European war has just begun, and the general public's thinking is already similar to that at the end of the last European war, especially the neutral small countries are in the most difficult situation. Their lives are really at stake and they are helpless.

### Japanese Troops Beaten in Jiangyin Southern Suburb;

Raids and Conflicts Occur in Houteng

According to a dispatch from Jiangyin, Japanese troops in this city, taking advantage of the New Year's holiday, engaged in widespread harassment. A few Japanese soldiers, at the Fukangxiang Hotel on Shizi Street in the southern suburb, had a misunderstanding with the hotel staff due to language barriers. Unexpectedly, local guerilla forces learned of the incident and promptly killed the Japanese soldiers. Furthermore, some Japanese soldiers went to nearby villages to seize chickens, causing disturbances. Simultaneously, within the city, a puppet police officer named Zhang Jiming fired his gun for no reason, causing great panic among the Japanese garrison. They closed the city gates for three days, cutting off the supply of firewood, rice, and vegetables. After the puppet county chief He Peixuan appealed to the Japanese side, they agreed to reopen the gates. However, people entering and leaving the city are now subject to stricter controls than before, and residents are not allowed to accommodate outsiders. If discovered, their houses will be confiscated. All hotels in the southern suburb are permanently banned from selling alcohol for drinking. Japanese soldiers have been stationed at the Bazhi Bridge, and residents avoid it by taking detours. In Houteng Town in Dongxiang, Japanese soldiers also went to the countryside, ostensibly for searching, and encountered plainclothes guerilla forces, resulting in minor conflicts. Three innocent people were killed. The Japanese troops did not dare to linger in Houteng and returned to the city on the same day.

### Overview of the Promotion of Free Education in China (V)

(3) Regarding the Improvement of Private Schools and Itinerant Teachers: It has been found that the number of private schools originally existing in various provinces is quite large. Therefore, it is stipulated in the free education plan that they should be utilized as much as possible and improved to supplement the inadequacy of primary schools. However, few provinces and cities have implemented this, so there is no statistical report. As for the pilot implementation of the itinerant teaching groups, some provinces and cities have promoted them, but their number is very small. According to reports from various provinces and cities, there were 200 groups in the 24th year and 735 groups in the 25th year.

C. Regarding the Raising of Funds for Free Education: According to the outline of the regulations, the funding for free education should be raised locally as a principle. However, for remote and impoverished provinces and cities with special circumstances, the central government may provide appropriate subsidies. The central government's subsidies to various provinces and cities for free education over the years totaled 3.2 million yuan in the 24th year, including 2.4 million yuan from the national treasury, 500,000 yuan for border education, and 300,000 yuan from the Sino-British, Sino-American, and Sino-French Boxer Indemnity funds. In the 25th year, it totaled 4.575 million yuan, including 3.9 million yuan from the educational construction funds, 500,000 yuan for border education, and 175,000 yuan from the Sino-American and Sino-French Boxer Indemnity funds. In the 26th year, it totaled 6.665 million yuan, including 5.9 million yuan from the educational construction funds, 500,000 yuan for border education, and 265,000 yuan from the Sino-British, Sino-American, Sino-French, and Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity funds. However, due to the war of resistance, the educational construction funds in the 26th year were reduced to 70% from September onwards, and 10,000 yuan from the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity was not allocated. Furthermore, the subsidies for the provinces and cities in various war zones were adjusted and suspended by order, so the actual amount could not be fully distributed. In the 27th year, it totaled 1.741 million yuan, including 1.407 million yuan from the educational construction funds, 224,000 yuan for border education, and 110,000 yuan from the Sino-British and Sino-American Boxer Indemnity funds. In the 28th year, considering that the reduced distribution of this subsidy would have a considerable impact on the promotion of free education, it was changed to a full distribution. The subsidy amount included 448,000 yuan for border education and 4.3 million yuan for free education. As for the free education funds raised by various provinces and cities over the years, in the 24th year, the increased free education funds raised by various provinces and cities, according to the reported figures, totaled approximately 10.707 million yuan, exceeding the total amount of central subsidies by three times. In the 25th year, according to the reported estimated figures, it totaled approximately 14.733831 million yuan, also exceeding the total amount of central subsidies by three times. In the 26th, 27th, and 28th years, due to the war of resistance, it was difficult for the provinces and cities in the war zones to raise additional funds. However, the provinces in the rear were still able to make efforts to raise funds.

### Foreign Nationals Hold Serious Views After the Philippe Case; Expect Thorough Investigation; The Three Assailants Remain at Large; Increased Police Presence in Western Shanghai

Following the assassination attempt on Mr. Philippe, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, on the morning of the 6th of this month, the authorities of the International Settlement have greatly increased police presence in the area of extra-settlement roads since the 7th. In the Italian military defense zone, near the extra-settlement roads, the number of patrols, which used to be only two or three, has been increased to seven or more since the previous day. To apprehend the assailants, the authorities of the International Settlement increased the number of Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives after the incident. In addition to patrolling and guarding the areas near the extra-settlement roads, they also checked pedestrians one by one within the settlement. The authorities of the International Settlement are continuing to demand the surrender of the assailants. It is reported that the three men who attacked Mr. Philippe have been apprehended in a village near the Haig Road shooting location in the western district. However, the Japanese military police authorities have reportedly strongly denied the protests of British Military Commander Major General Simmons, claiming that no assailants have been captured. According to another report, the shooting incident occurred between Haig Road and Avenue Foch of the French Concession. As many as ten shots were fired in quick succession that morning, eight of which hit Mr. Philippe's car. One bullet even hit the right side of the back of the seat in Mr. Philippe's car. Mr. Philippe's escape was considered fortunate. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department of the International Settlement is now taking special precautions at Mr. Philippe's private residence and has dispatched Chinese and Western detectives under Mr. Philippe's command for protection.

The Three Assailants Have Not Been Handed Over

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that although the "enemy-occupied territory" authorities acknowledged to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department of the International Settlement on Saturday that they had captured three assailants who attempted to assassinate Philippe, they have not released any information about the whereabouts of the three assailants and even claim that they have not captured the assailants. The British Military Authorities of the Municipal Police Department and the British Consulate General have requested cooperation in apprehending the assailants, but to no avail. It is understood that the three arrested men are now at the headquarters of the Japanese military police at 94 Jessfield Road. Police officers from the Municipal Police Department went to the "Avenue" Police Station on Saturday to request the chief of police to hand over the three men. The chief of police first claimed that he was unaware of the arrests, then made three phone calls and informed the Municipal Police Department officers that three men holding Mauser pistols had been captured but could not be handed over because they were not arrested by the "Avenue" police. Subsequently, the Municipal Police Department's attempts to detain the three men were unsuccessful.

Foreign Nationals Consider It Serious

The "Shanghai Times" reported that, according to reliable sources, the Municipal Council will submit a detailed report to the Consular Body and other responsible authorities regarding the assassination attempt on Secretary-General and President Philippe on Saturday morning. Senior foreign nationals in the city consider the case very serious and expect that it will not be allowed to be shelved and will only be resolved after the assailants are apprehended and the case is clarified.

Negotiations Expected Soon

There is much speculation among the general public about the motives behind the case. Although the Municipal Police Department claims that the three assailants were captured by bodyguards from a gambling den on Haig Road and handed over to the police station, which transferred them to the headquarters of the Japanese military police at 94 Jessfield Road, they are still being held there. However, the Japanese side claims to be completely unaware of the matter. It is expected that the authorities will discuss the case soon.

The Assassination Attempt Was Carefully Planned

It has been found that the assailants carefully planned the assassination attempt. About ten accomplices intercepted three rickshaw pullers on Brenan Road early Saturday morning, robbed their clothes and vehicles, and detained the rickshaw pullers. The rickshaw pullers were released after the incident and went to the Jing'an Temple police station to report what had happened.

Strict Security in the "Enemy-Occupied Territory"

The "Continental Daily News" also reported that security was tight in the "enemy-occupied territory" yesterday. The Italian military defense zone occupies part of the extra-settlement road area, so the number of Italian soldiers on patrol in the area has been doubled. These patrol teams, which previously had only three soldiers per team, have been increased to five to seven soldiers per team. The two sentries stationed daily on Edinburgh Road and Avenue Road have been increased to four. In addition, armored vehicles and Indian mounted police from the Municipal Police Department were on standby in the area throughout the day, and the number of patrol officers at each intersection has also been increased.

### Japanese Warships Patrolling North of the Yangtze River Reportedly Sailed to Guangdong

No Japanese Warships Follow Foreign Ships to Various Ports

Navigation along the North Bank line of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been greatly affected in recent months due to Japanese obstruction of foreign ships loading passengers and cargo. According to shipping industry sources, the Japanese have recently tightened their control over cargo transport to ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. German and Italian commercial ships sailing to ports such as Hutong, Qinglong, and Xingang are unable to load cargo, resulting in large quantities of goods piled up in various places. The Japanese are particularly attentive to British Jardine Matheson and Taikoo ships sailing in the area, sending patrol boats to accompany and obstruct them. Other German and Italian ships also feel inconvenienced. According to a British ship crew member who returned to Shanghai the other day, it is said that the Japanese warships patrolling the Yangtze River near the North Bank have gone to Guangdong. Therefore, no Japanese warships follow ships sailing to ports such as Qinglong and Hutong, and loading and unloading cargo has become more convenient, but it is unknown how long this will last.

### The Puppet "Reformed Government" Sends Out Strange Invitations; Inviting People to a Banquet at the Repulse Bay Hotel in Hong Kong and Claiming "Recovery of Hong Kong and Signing of Treaty"

Newspapers such as the "Shanghai Times" and the English-language "North China Daily News" reported that they had received English invitations from a person claiming to be Gan, a specialist for the "Reformed Government of the Republic of China" for the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement, Hong Kong, Kowloon, etc. The invitation was to attend a banquet to be held at the Repulse Bay Hotel in Hong Kong to "celebrate the signing of a treaty between China and the UK on the return of Hong Kong." However, the date of the banquet was not specified, only stating that "the exact date of the signing of the treaty will be announced later." The invitation was sent from 8 Gulou New Village, Nanjing, on January 1st and asked recipients to reply whether they could attend. It also stated that "when the Sino-British agreement is formally signed, the return of Hong Kong to China will become a reality. The encroachment on China's territorial sovereignty by foreign concessions in various places is now a thing of the past."

### Joint Charity Association to Begin Distributing Steamed Buns Tonight – Distributing near Longmen Road Each Evening – Still Hopeful for Donations from All Sectors

The Shanghai Charity Association Federation, in order to relieve the poor people of this city, in addition to opening cold shelters as usual, has also decided to distribute steamed buns every evening starting today (the 9th). Our reporter from Datong News Agency has investigated and recorded the details as follows:

Measures for Distributing Wheat Flour Steamed Buns

The Shanghai Charity Association Federation, in view of the fact that the number of refugees and beggars dying of hunger and cold this winter is greater than in previous years, has decided to start distributing steamed buns earlier, starting today (the 9th). The location has been selected as the Renji Infant Nursery area on Longmen Road, south of the Race Course. The distribution time is set for 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM every evening. In terms of order, the Chengdu Road police station will send officers to maintain it. The association plans to prepare five to six thousand wheat flour steamed buns each evening, each weighing four taels. Depending on the number of people, each person will be given two to four buns. Regarding the care on the road, the association has appointed Mr. Lu Deshen and Mr. Cheng Tongsheng to be specifically responsible for handling it. This charitable act of distributing steamed buns will be limited to one month, ending at the end of the old lunar year. In order to help these poor people receiving steamed buns to resist the cold, the association will distribute a cup of hot ginger soup to each person. The thoughtfulness of providing benevolent drinks and righteous grains can be described as thorough. In addition to the 5,000 yuan generously donated by Mr. Wang Junsheng of Pushan Villa, the above-mentioned distribution expenses are still hoped to be subsidized by all sectors.

Cold Shelters Being Organized

In addition to distributing steamed buns, the association is also very concerned about the problem of cold protection for the poor people. In addition to the first cold shelter that has been opened at No. 330 North Fujian Road, which has already taken in more than 700 poor people, the second cold shelter will also be opened within days. The location is planned to be at the Xujiahui Catholic Church and negotiations are in progress.

Secret Relief for Hidden Poor

The association is also aware that prices are soaring in Shanghai, and the prices of firewood and rice are particularly expensive. Many middle- and lower-class families find it difficult to make ends meet. However, in order to save face, they do not hesitate to borrow and pawn, cutting flesh to heal sores. The mental distress of these hidden poor people is even greater than that of the extremely poor. According to the reporter from Datong News Agency, the association is currently planning relief measures. The method will also start secretly, either by friends and relatives reporting on their behalf, or by the person directly writing to the association for a statement, and they can use a pseudonym. The association will absolutely keep the above-mentioned relief matters confidential.

### Decision on Stabilizing Rice Prices – Six and a Half Catties of Broken Rice per Yuan, Limited to One Yuan Purchase – One Hundred Designated Rice Shops Responsible for Handling

### Local Russians Celebrate Christmas

The North China Daily News reported that the Russian Christmas Day, which is traditionally celebrated on January 7, is thirteen days later than the Christmas Day celebrated by Christians in other countries. The approximately 20,000 White Russian expatriates in this city are mostly devout believers and went to church to participate in the service on Christmas Eve last Saturday night. In terms of family, according to the old Russian custom, one must absolutely fast before the first star appears in the sky that night. However, for those who live in large cities abroad, such as Shanghai, it is very inconvenient to strictly abstain from food, so they reduce their food intake. However, Russian Christmas is the same as Easter. The housewife must always prepare special seasonal dishes to decorate the auspicious day. As for the celebrations outside the family, Russian community groups have been severely hit by the economy, and the grand occasion is far less than in previous years. Only White Russian schools and charitable organizations hold Christmas tree banquets to entertain children. Russian newspapers have published Christmas special issues to show their celebrations.

### Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong – Property Rights Falling into Foreign Hands – Japanese "Hengchan Company" Designates "Construction Zone" – Enclosing Vast Areas, Property Owners Unable to Intervene

Since its establishment last year, the Japanese-invested "Shanghai Hengchan Company" has been actively seizing private land to build houses for profit. Recently, it has hired dozens of Japanese supervisors to oversee a large number of ignorant Chinese laborers to dismantle graves, causing corpses and bones to be scattered everywhere, a tragic sight to behold. The details are recorded as follows:

"Construction Zone" Forcibly Seizes Private Land

The so-called "Shanghai Hengchan Company" is a Japanese semi-official profit-making organization. Last year, it obtained the consent of the Japanese special service agency and designated a vast area of land in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong as a "construction zone." The property in the designated area, regardless of who owns it, will be seized. Because most people fled abroad after the war, the company was able to do whatever it wanted and could not be dealt with. Even a few poor people who had no choice but to return to their hometown saw that their houses and properties had been enclosed and could not live there. If they tried to entrust powerful people to mediate, the "company" would arbitrarily estimate the lowest land price and give them a paper voucher that could not be cashed, without getting a penny. If no one helps, their property will be lost.

Puppet Land Bureau Unable to Intervene

The puppet "Land Bureau" believes that the above-mentioned situation of arbitrarily and forcibly confiscating people's land is also inappropriate, and the "Hengchan Company" did not notify the puppet "bureau" or puppet "government" when enclosing private land, regardless of them. The puppet "Land Bureau" believed that it was infringing on its rights, so it repeatedly sent people to the "Hengchan Company" to negotiate politely last year, requesting that the puppet bureau agree to the procedures before the company encloses private land. However, the Hengchan Company ignored this request, so the puppet bureau could not intervene in the company's actions.

Laborers Greedy for Profit, Digging Graves and Dismantling Coffins

After a year of operation, Hengchan Company has selected originally bustling urban areas in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong to build houses first in order to rent them out for profit. In addition, it has also been tidying up the more remote enclosed land recently, and has sent dozens of Japanese "supervisors" to oversee hundreds of ignorant Chinese laborers to dig up graves, move floating coffins, and move coffins from all over every day. These workers are even more ruthless and believe that there are often metal objects left in the coffins by the dead relatives, so they collude with the "supervisors" to arbitrarily open the coffins to search for better coffins, causing the coffins to be messy, or even scattered all over the ground. The harm is particularly severe in the countryside around Jiangwan Town.

Yunzaobang Properties Enclosed

Also, it is reported that the Japanese have designated Yunzaobang in Wusong as a "commercial port" and plan to build a "new city." The preliminary plan has been implemented. Starting from Yizhou Pond Yunzaobang Estuary, all the way west to Jiaqiao, the most private land has been enclosed, with the most being in Tuier Shiyi, Tuier Shier, and Gang Sanshier. This procedure is entrusted by the Japanese "Hengchan Company" to the puppet municipal government land bureau for valuation and handling "registration" within a limited time. Those who do not go within the time limit will have their land confiscated. It is now known that the private land purchased is sold for more than one thousand yuan, all issued with Hua Xing public bonds that have no guarantee, and no cash is available. There are even local ruffians who act as accomplices, using intimidation to force the villagers to sell the land they cultivate for a living at the lowest price and must move to live elsewhere.

### Japanese Censor Suppresses Reuters Telegrams – News of the Burning of a British Hospital by the Japanese Army – Detained Twice, Arriving After a Long Delay

Reuters Shanghai, January 8 – It was learned here today that a Reuters telegram from Qingdao about the burning of the British Managed Hospital near Wudingfu in Shandong Province on Christmas Day by Japanese soldiers had been suppressed, presumably by Japanese censors. The first telegram, sent from Qingdao at 6:15 PM on January 4, did not reach Shanghai until after 7:00 PM on January 6, taking as long as 48 hours. The second telegram, reporting that the Japanese authorities admitted that the hospital had been burned, was sent from Qingdao at 6:00 PM on January 5 and did not arrive until 2:15 PM on January 6, also detained for a long time. According to the only telegraphic communication from Qingdao to Shanghai, the wireless company managed by the Japanese, the usual time required for a normal Qingdao-Shanghai communication is about three hours. The Shanghai branch of the wireless company said that everything was as usual in the past few days.

### Farmers Bank Handles – Agricultural Product Storage Pledge

Grains, Wheat, Cotton, Miscellaneous Grains, and Native Cloth – Priority Right to Purchase with License

### Group Rice Purchase and Price Stabilization – Price Stabilization Measures Can Only Provide Temporary Relief, but Group Rice Ordering Has Self-Defense Significance

— Kui Yanfang

Since the rice price in this city soared, it has had a great impact on social order and the security of the concessions. Those who are frozen and starved are not afraid of the law and take risks. Robbing rice and looting on the road occur from time to time. Salary earners are also greatly threatened in their lives. Therefore, employees of shops, companies, and factories demand wage increases to solve their lives and go on strike. Labor and management are at odds, disputes arise one after another, people are frightened, and society is uneasy. At present, when there is a bumper harvest everywhere and new grains have just been harvested, such a serious situation has been brewed. If the time comes when the old and new grains are not connected, the four million citizens of this city may be in danger of running out of food, and the danger is even more unbearable to imagine. Yanfang believes that in this period, if we do not recognize the goal, work together, and plan measures, we will not be able to solve this serious problem. Therefore, in December of last year, I asked Yu Qiao Lao and leaders of the industrial and commercial circles to organize the Shanghai Civil Food Adjustment Association. At the same time, Yanfang published a tentative proposal on adjusting the Shanghai civil food plan in various newspapers, detailing the ordering methods. Fortunately, this proposal was approved by all sectors. Therefore, the association raised a fund of one million yuan and determined that its purpose was to purchase foreign rice to adjust the market. When the association is dissolved, the fund will be returned according to the ratio of losses suffered from purchasing rice to stabilize the market. It is a good method for the United States, France, and Italy, which is the most effective method for adjusting civil food. Within ten days, group rice purchasers from all walks of life flocked to register with the association, and the Shanghai rice market also stabilized slightly.

Recently, some people have advocated price stabilization for relief. If we can take care of both and proceed together, it is also feasible. However, group rice purchase is the key strategy for adjusting civil food at present, and it cannot be abandoned. It should be actively promoted to achieve complete success. Group rice purchase is a fundamental solution, while price stabilization is a temporary solution. The nature is different, and the effectiveness is different.

1. The purpose of group rice purchase is to plan ahead and prevent rice shortages. Shops, factories, schools, etc., should purchase foreign rice in advance according to the amount of rice they need, and store another 100,000 bags of foreign rice in a safe warehouse. In case the rice price soars again, this 100,000 bags of rice will be sold to flatten the market, and speculators will have no use for their skills. In this way, the rice price will naturally fall, and the manipulation of speculators will be useless. In this way, the rice price will naturally fall. However, once the 100,000 bags of stored rice are sold, they must be immediately replenished in sufficient quantities to ensure that the warehouse has storage and is not afraid of anything. In any case, with this 100,000 bags of stored grain, there is no need to worry about rice shortages, and flattening the market price is another matter. This is considering the consumers themselves and contains the meaning of economic self-defense.

2. Price stabilization is also a method for adjusting civil food. At present, there are 4 million residents in Shanghai, of which at least 3 million are working poor. If 1 million yuan is raised for price stabilization, the average person will get only the food rice worth 30 cents in national currency. This small amount is of no help. It is not easy to raise a huge sum of 10 million yuan. Moreover, price stabilization is a charitable matter, not a fundamental solution. As for the procedure for handling price stabilization, if it is not strict, there will be many malpractices. If it is too strict, the benefits will not be widespread. I still remember that in September of last year, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held price stabilization events in the public concession and the French concession. There were many rice purchasers, and it was very crowded. Injuries and loss of items were often heard. Women and the elderly stood all day long, and often did not get a single grain of rice. The strong took the lead and often gained more than their share. It is said that this time the price stabilization has set up 50 price stabilization points in the two concessions. Although crowding can be avoided, it is worth noting whether it can be universally beneficial and make the majority of the poor not feel left out.

3. The fund for group ordering of foreign rice was originally set at 1 million yuan. Now, due to the enthusiastic participation of various industries, it has increased to 2 million yuan. It can be seen that this matter is closely related to the livelihood of the general public, so it can be supported by the public. Moreover, the use of this fund is endless, circulating to purchase rice, which can flatten the market price for a long time and prevent manipulators from having the opportunity to hoard. The solution to the Shanghai food problem depends on this. Its benefits are universal and benefit both the rich and the poor. It is not just a passive measure like price stabilization, where the beneficiaries are limited to a local group of people, and it is only temporary.

4. The fund for group ordering of foreign rice will be fully returned to the original payers after the rice price falls and returns to normal, and after the association is dissolved, except for the unavoidable losses. Compared with the fund raised for price stabilization, it is just a charitable donation, which is very different. Moreover, group rice purchase and flattening the market price are aimed at ensuring the livelihood of the majority of citizens. If we do not prepare for it now, when the rice is exhausted in the future, we will not be able to purchase it even if we increase its value. In the future, whether the livelihood of Shanghai citizens and the peace of society can be maintained in the long term is even more difficult to predict. As for price stabilization, although it can provide temporary relief, its relationship with the entire city is not as deep and close as this.

In short, for social public welfare undertakings, we should sacrifice the private interests of the minority and seek the welfare of the majority. Some say that the purpose of holding price stabilization and group rice purchase this time is to adjust civil food, and the goals are the same, so things can be done in parallel without being contradictory. In fact, no matter what, there is a distinction between the order of priority and importance, which cannot be regarded as the same. Although price stabilization can adjust civil food, its effect is minimal, and the benefits it provides are also small. As for group rice purchase, it is a guarantee for the future life of citizens. All industrial, commercial, academic, and economic citizens who are able to support themselves should be responsible for actively ordering. Or perhaps the general public is dazzled by the good name of price stabilization and forgets the benefits of group rice purchase and is lazy in promoting it. In the future, they will suffer the consequences themselves and regret it too late. Therefore, Yanfang does not hesitate to spend words to tell the social figures of this city.

### Domestic Goods Organizations Appeal for – Free Transportation

Should Be Differentiated Clearly – Shanghai's Production and Sales Need to Be Developed Urgently

In order to increase wartime production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has repeatedly conducted in-depth research with relevant agencies on the export of non-prohibited local goods and the import of completely domestic goods, and formulated measures. After being approved by the Military Affairs Committee, domestic goods products in various guerrilla areas are prohibited from being imported into the interior. However, for the products of Chinese factories within the Shanghai Concession, those that are verified to be actual domestic goods are allowed to be imported. For goods that have been manufactured, they are not allowed to be imported. The ministry has already telegraphed the municipal governments of various cities to inform them and ordered the Ministry of Finance to notify all customs offices across the country to comply with it. At this critical time, some domestic goods factories in this city, although named domestic goods, mostly use raw materials from foreign countries. However, most factories still try their best to use domestic raw materials. In addition, at a time when all industries and businesses are feeling distressed and various places are suffering from invisible blockades, it is not easy to sell domestic goods internally. If the transportation of domestic goods to the interior is prohibited again, Shanghai's domestic goods industry will suffer a serious blow. Therefore, after repeated consultations between domestic goods organizations in this city, it was decided to submit a report to the authorities detailing their difficult situation, and to call for a clear distinction to be made and for the order to be revoked, allowing domestic goods to be transported freely for domestic sales, in order to maintain the entire domestic goods market. Moreover, at a time when the war of resistance has not yet ended, production should be increased and developed both domestically and internationally.

### Coal Price Soars – Affecting Industry

National Products Manufacturers Association Expresses Support for Implementing Group Purchase and Transportation

The China National Products Manufacturers Association sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special Zone Citizens Association yesterday, saying that it had read in the newspaper that Committee Member Zhang Yizhai and others jointly suggested group coal purchase, and the various branches of the association responded enthusiastically, requesting to discuss and implement it as soon as possible to relieve the people's difficulties. It is indeed the most urgent task in Shanghai at present. Coal is a necessity for people's livelihood. The prosperity of factories, the smoothness of public utilities, and the level of commodity prices are all closely related to it. All civilized countries in the world regard it as the mother of industry and the source of science. Recently, the price of coal in Shanghai has soared, which is due to the smooth flow of sources and the manipulation of a small number of large coal merchants. As Committee Member Zhang and others said, the original price of Kailuan coal is still only about 40 yuan per ton. Once these people transfer it, it will double or more. And the various industries, in view of the soaring coal price, have raised costs and sold at higher prices. This echoes each other and has a great impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. The association is a group of domestic goods factories and deeply feels that the soaring coal price affects the production of member factories and is also greatly related to social security. Therefore, it expresses its great approval of the suggestions of your committee members and others. It is specially sending a letter to request that you discuss and implement it as soon as possible to stabilize people's livelihood and benefit domestic goods. It is hoped.

### Rectifying Wind School Staff Member, Wang Daonan, Stabbed - Walking Alone, Suddenly Surrounded by Three Men, Suffering Six or Seven Knife Wounds, Life Not Yet in Danger

Yesterday at around 1:00 PM, a man was walking alone at the intersection of Hart Road and Annam Road in the Public Concession when suddenly three men in short clothes blocked his path. One of them pulled out a triangular bayonet and stabbed the man violently six or seven times. The man was caught off guard and was stabbed in the head, hands, and other parts, causing blood to flow profusely. He cried out for help. The assailants, seeing their objective achieved, fled. Afterwards, patrol officers took the injured man to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. It was later learned that the injured man was named Wang Daonan, 30 years old, from Jiujiang, Jiangxi. He had been working as the Dean of Students at the Rectifying Wind School at 60 Rue Amiral Bayle in the French Concession since August of last year and is still employed at the school. At the time of the incident, he was out and about on behalf of the school.

The cause of the case is currently under investigation by the police.

### Sister and Brother, Kidnapping a Girl, Sentenced and Given Probation

Guihong, the 11-year-old daughter of Mrs. Meng Zhang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 39, Lane 847, Tiantong Road, suddenly disappeared at around 5:00 PM on the 6th of this month. She asked people to search everywhere, but to no avail. She did not return that evening. Mrs. Meng Zhang, knowing that the neighbor’s maidservant, Chen Zhou, from the same hometown, often went out to play with her daughter, questioned her, but her answers were evasive. She reported the situation to the Mixed Court of the Public Concession. Detective Shen Dehui took Chen Zhou to the police station. Under strict questioning, she finally confessed that she had lured Guihong out and sent her to her younger brother, Zhou Dexing, intending to take her back to their hometown and sell her to a wealthy family to spend the money. Detective Shen then apprehended her younger brother, Zhou Dexing, and detained him as well. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Mr. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, explained the case and requested prosecution, stating that when the police pursued Chen Zhou, her brother, knowing the matter was improper, had someone send the girl back. Subsequently, the Meng girl and her mother testified about the incident. Questioned about the accusations, the two defendants confessed that they were confused and resorted to this desperate measure, begging for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi sentenced Chen Zhou and Zhou Dexing to six months imprisonment each, but granted a three-year probation considering their ignorance and first offense.

### Avenue Road Incident: Bandits Resist Arrest

Yesterday at around 4:00 PM, four bandits broke into the residence of Wu Jinsheng, a foreign goods broker, at No. 3, Lane 102, Zhangjiazhai Road, Avenue Road in the Public Concession. Two bandits brandished pistols, threatening and rummaging through boxes and chests, arbitrarily looting for about 20 minutes. They stole clothing, ornaments, and approximately two thousand yuan in legal tender. While the bandits were looting, two maids in the house sneaked out through the back door and reported the incident to Chinese Constable No. 1394. The Chinese Constable immediately telephoned the relevant police station. The head of the police station, upon receiving the report, dispatched a large number of armed detectives, who surrounded the house. However, the bandits were unaware that detectives were stationed outside. They carried the stolen goods and rushed out of the door to escape. The detectives bravely stepped forward to arrest them. Seeing a large number of detectives, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives also returned fire. The bandits fired while fleeing. The detectives pursued closely. Two bandits fled to the intersection of Avenue Road and Carter Road, where Western Constable No. 126 shot them down.

Yesterday morning, the police sent the defendant to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, charging him with assault and obstructing official duties. First, the plaintiff, Sun Jiyi, filed a report, stating, "Tonight, I pulled a foreigner from Jin Shenfu Road to the Garden Bridge. He gave me a thirty-cent gambling token, which cannot be used in the market. I asked him to exchange it for cash. At this time, the defendant passed by and, without asking why, ran up and hit me on the back of the head with a hammer." The court verified the testimony and questioned the defendant, who confessed that he acted under the influence of alcohol and requested leniency. The court concluded the trial and sentenced Paul Liumsong to 30 days of detention for causing bodily harm, and the hammer was confiscated.

Mediation by the court failed

The Bao Tai Pawnshop, located at the intersection of Rue de la Mairie and Ba Li Bridge Street in the French Concession, accidentally caught fire around midnight on August 16th of last year, near curfew time, burning a corner of the building. It was insured against fire. Afterwards, the insurance company paid out 60,000 yuan in insurance. However, the pawnshop refused to compensate the customers for their pawned goods. Therefore, 119 customers with 448 pawn tickets elected Yin Shilin, Wang Zengji, and Fang Xiangtai to hire lawyer Ji Chao to represent them and negotiate with Xia Deyang, the owner of Bao Tai Pawnshop, demanding compensation. However, he refused to listen. Lawyer Ji, acting on their behalf, filed a lawsuit against Xia Deyang in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, demanding compensation for damages based on 50% of the pawned value, amounting to 9,265 yuan and 10 cents, and requested legal aid. Judge Yu Changzi ruled to reject the legal aid request and ordered them to pay the court fees within ten days. Now, the customer representatives Yin Wang and Fang have hired lawyer Ji to file a request for mediation of compensation with the Second Special District Court. The court accepted the request, and Judge Shen held a hearing for mediation yesterday afternoon. The customers and the three representatives, along with lawyer Ji, appeared in court. However, the opposing party, Xia Deyang, did not appear, preventing mediation from proceeding. The court declared the mediation unsuccessful.

Sexual Health

### Women with Strong Emotions Should Not Practice Celibacy Without Authorization

— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Everyone knows the harm of indulgence, but they do not know that celibacy also has its harms. For women with weak sexual desire, celibacy is not difficult. Therefore, they can maintain their single life, pure and flawless, throughout their lives. They also have no physical or mental illnesses. The opposite is true: if the body is very healthy and sexual desire is often aroused, if there is no contact with the opposite sex, celibacy can still be enforced, and diseases will not occur. If, in their youth, they like socializing, read obscene books, or have had contact with the opposite sex, the result of celibacy will inevitably lead to neurosis. Most people suffering from hysteria are caused by this. If they are forced to practice celibacy, they will often do anything, taking an active role to solicit men. All of this is a reaction to celibacy, and it is not surprising. Therefore, women with strong emotions should never practice celibacy without authorization.

Also, when a woman suddenly encounters misfortune, or loses the love of her husband, or her husband travels far away and does not return, she becomes worried and depressed, causing all kinds of illnesses. Therefore, these women are the most tragic.

The above reasons for women to be forced to practice celibacy are often seen in society. But there is something even more tragic that causes women to lose the pleasure of sex, which is the husband's kidney deficiency and illness, and inability to perform sexually, often suffering from premature ejaculation and impotence. Therefore, the love between husband and wife is poor, and there are often quarrels. In severe cases, the wife cannot bear the loneliness and commits adultery, spreading scandalous names everywhere. This not only deprives the woman of the pleasure of marriage, but the man himself also feels that there is no pleasure at all. This is truly an important family problem.

According to a survey by German medical experts, men who are sexually weak account for half of every ten men. Now, to treat this kind of disease, in addition to preventing self-pollution before marriage, one should also practice abstinence after marriage. The function of the sexual mechanism cannot be abandoned or indulged. After indulgence, kidney deficiency is inevitable, and it is difficult to generate love during bed pleasure. Therefore, in order to seek the happiness of both parties, men with kidney deficiency should be treated quickly. If they do not follow the doctor's guidance and abuse aphrodisiacs on the market and supplements similar to aphrodisiacs, not only will they have no effect, but they will increase the disease. Therefore, only the genuine male "Bu Ti Kang" made from male animal testicular essence taken internally can increase sperm and replenish blood, strengthen the brain and consolidate the kidneys, so that symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and spermatorrhea can be cured in a short period of time. This has long been achieved in our clinical experiments and we are happy to introduce it to patients, so that affectionate women will not cause family unhappiness due to their husband's kidney deficiency. This is why "Bu Ti Kang" is highly respected by both the medical and pharmaceutical industries, and is far from comparable to inferior drugs. The female version has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting conception, and is sold in pharmacies.

Gonorrhea Annals

### Proving with Ironclad Facts That Leukorrhea Is Easy to Cure

Many old-fashioned gonorrhea internal medicines and therapies have been proven ineffective by modern expert physicians and patients. Therefore, the research on new therapies is in full swing. Scholars bury themselves in their work and exhaust countless efforts and brainpower, and finally discover a truth about gonorrhea treatment in a test tube, which temporarily shook the medical world and was recognized as the greatest achievement in the treatment of gonorrhea. At that time, I was studying medicine in the United States. I was determined to study it and read all the medical journals published in various countries. I learned that it was a new method based on the latest science, which combines refined pure pigments and proteomes with other pure and powerful bactericidal chemical drugs to make a solution, which is used to soak gonococci, and the gonococci are seen to die quickly.

Many scholars are university professors or gonorrhea specialists. They have also repeatedly tested the agent and proved that it has great efficacy. The gonococci in the test tube's slanted culture medium are usually very active and lively. If this liquid medicine is injected into the test tube, the gonococci will die immediately. Later, Dr. Peter, a German master of gonorrhea, took it a step further and made "Klinong" from pure yellow pigment and specially made proteome. From then on, the treatment of gonorrhea opened a new world. All acute and chronic gonorrhea, such as balanitis, prostatitis, cystitis, orchitis in men, and gonorrheal leucorrhea, uterine inflammation, and vaginal gonorrhea in women, can be quickly and fundamentally cured by taking "Klinong", which has long been praised by word of mouth. In venereal disease hospitals in various countries, it is used as a living medicine in gonorrhea internal medicines, and its value is evident. Men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Carl's Snow Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories. It is even better to treat yourself at home according to the instructions and the instructions ("Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is sold in both Sino-Western Taihe drugstores) - Written by Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine

### Self-Treatment Before Becoming Consumptive

— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang

Coughing is a precursor to becoming consumptive, so in order to avoid lung disease, it is necessary to treat coughing first. To cure coughing, it is not necessary to consult a doctor. Using effective medicines for self-treatment at home can be as effective as treatment at the doctor's office. Moreover, treatment at home is more convenient than staying in the hospital. Based on my experience of more than 20 years, I have come into contact with countless patients, and the only medicine that can relieve coughs in a short period of time is the sacred medicine for lung disease "Bu Fei Na Yu". The effect of this medicine in relieving coughs is completely based on the cause of the cough, and it is by no means comparable to ordinary and violent anesthetics.

### Cured Case of Spermatorrhea, Spermatorrhea After Abstinence

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

Patient Wang Yiqin, from Jiangwan, 25 years old, (self-reported) - When I was young, I was very healthy and liked to read erotic books and paintings, and I liked to talk about the trivial matters between men and women. At the age of 18, I was seduced by my colleagues and went whoring several times, which was excessive. At the age of 23, I suddenly contracted syphilis. After seeking medical treatment, I had more than 6068 injections, and the syphilis was finally cured. Since then, I dared not try whoring again. Even when sexual desire was aroused, I had to try my best to suppress it. Unexpectedly, after a year, spermatorrhea occurred. At first, it was only two or three times a month, but then it gradually increased, and it even occurred two or three times a week. My body gradually weakened, I felt very tired, my brain was weak and forgetful, and I suffered from insomnia at night. I had taken six bottles of tonics and ten injections, but they were not effective. Now that the wedding is imminent, I am writing to you for help from all the doctors. (Cure process) - I was told to take care of myself and take "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" and the German testicular essence preparation for men "Bu Ti Kang". Mr. Wang followed the advice, and after a month, he was full of energy, and there was no more spermatorrhea. After taking it for another month, he gained weight and his health improved day by day.

### Methods for Treating Stubborn Old Leukorrhea

— Written by Physician Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

Leukorrhea transitioning from acute to chronic, and further from chronic becoming stubbornly entrenched, once it turns into stubborn old leukorrhea, the gonorrhea patient will undoubtedly find passing these long years to be an exceedingly difficult matter. Therefore, gonorrhea patients, upon hearing of the difficulty in treating stubborn old leukorrhea, feel as if suddenly struck by an electric current, and pronounce their own death sentence. However, with the rapid advancement of medical science today, it is almost progressing at a rate of a thousand miles a day. What was once considered difficult to treat, stubborn old leukorrhea, now has methods to be completely cured! For example, arthritis, which is difficult to cure in gonorrhea, according to my twenty years of research, is not as difficult to treat as generally imagined. I also use the latest scientific methods to first make a detailed diagnosis, to know the extent of this gonorrheal arthritis, and then apply appropriate treatment. Gonorrheal arthritis has a very wide range of involvement, and its onset is different from suppurated arthritis, and different again from arthritis after suppuration. And the most appropriate, comprehensive treatment is to use German anti-gonorrhea serum for intravenous injection. At the same time, use the gonorrhea panacea "Kelinong" as an internal medicine, to make the body produce a general bactericidal effect. In terms of electrotherapy, German Static Electrotherapy and Wettere X-ray therapy can always cure it in a short period of time. Now, I will try to explain the reason as follows: First, because in gonorrheal arthritis, the gonococci travel irregularly, often appearing in one place and then another! They wander aimlessly. However, the swelling and pain at the major joints are greater. Second, "Kelinong" has the power to resist gonococcal bacteriophages. This anti-gonococcal toxin is dispersed throughout the blood, traveling back and forth to destroy the gonococci. The use of static electricity and X-ray electrotherapy, as well as anti-gonorrhea serum, not only have a bactericidal effect, but also decompose the adhered arthritis. Therefore, even if gonorrheal arthritis is about to become a disability, it can be quickly cured. Twenty appointment tickets are given out each day, with each ticket costing only five jiao, and a free book on venereal disease is given away. Also treating syphilis, chancroid, and buboes.

### Finance 香港資金流滬日巨 外匯多頭紛紛轉賣

### Hong Kong Funds Flow to Shanghai Daily in Huge Amounts, Forex Bulls Sell Off

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. The OTC market for British and American currencies was quite tense in the morning, as operators have been paying close attention to Hong Kong's activities in recent days. Yesterday morning, Hong Kong telegraphs had not yet started selling, but around 9:30 AM, there was a sudden wave of selling. Most speculators holding long positions, seeing that Hong Kong funds were flowing to Shanghai in huge amounts daily, felt uneasy. Therefore, to avoid the expansion of short positions, they quickly followed suit and sold, causing the market price to tighten, but eventually reversed and eased. The situation that day: the opening was flat. Subsequently, China Merchants Bank and speculators took the lead in buying, and soon Sassoon also bought. Moreover, foreign banks' willingness to supply was not strong, so the tightening trend was quite rapid at one point. In less than half an hour, the British gold rate shrank to 4 shillings and 6.875 pence, and the US exchange rate fell to 7.625 yuan. Fortunately, a certain American bank strongly sold off February US exchange rates at 7.4375 and 7.5 yuan, in quite large quantities. Later, it relied on Hong Kong telegraphs' continuous selling, and those who initially held long positions, seeing the unfavorable situation, turned to selling, so the positions were suddenly filled, and the market trend eased. By the afternoon, the British gold rate had actually hardened to 4 shillings and 9.375 pence, and the US exchange rate had also risen to 8.09375 yuan. After entering, HSBC saw the cheap price and absorbed, and the situation was slightly calmed. By the evening close, the British gold rate was still at 4 shillings and 9.0625 pence, and the US exchange rate was still at 8.03125 yuan. As a result, compared to last weekend, the British rate eased by 125, and the American rate hardened by 21875. Futures were slightly tight, trending the same as the spot market.

The trend was tight first, then loose.

In the early morning, because London's major lines and the Bank of America's rates were closed for business and there were no telegrams, London's gold price was fixed. The exchange rates of British against American and against French currencies were flat, while against Shanghai, it shrank by 0625. American against British and against French currencies were all flat, while against Shanghai, it was down by 15 cents. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 4 shillings and 7.8125 pence for the British rate and 7.8125 yuan for the US exchange rate, with no change compared to last weekend. After opening, speculators and China Merchants Bank took the lead in buying, and Sassoon also had a strong buying interest. Moreover, foreign banks' willingness to supply was weak, so the market immediately tightened. By 9:20 AM, the British gold rate had eased to 4 shillings and 6.875 pence, and the US exchange rate had tightened to 7.625 yuan. Fortunately, a certain American bank was still willing to supply, selling February US exchange rates at 7.4375 and 7.5 yuan to Chinese merchants, so the situation was slightly stabilized. HSBC's listed prices were announced and unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced and also showed no increase or decrease. Unexpectedly, Hong Kong telegraphs suddenly started selling, causing people's hearts to change rapidly. Chinese banks and speculators immediately followed suit and sold, and those who had initially entered were also hesitant to move forward. Furthermore, the willingness to sell also increased due to profits, so the market trend immediately eased. By 10:45 AM, the British gold rate had hardened to 4 shillings and 8.75 pence, and the US exchange rate had also risen to 7.9375 yuan. Later, foreign firms made some settlements, and the selling wind gradually subsided, so the situation gradually returned to normal. By the noon close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 8.4375 pence for the British rate and 7.90625 yuan for the US exchange rate, compared to the morning opening, the British rate eased by 0625, and the American rate hardened by 09375.

The US dollar again exceeded 8 yuan.

The market weakened further because Hong Kong telegraphs again sent telegrams to sell, and Chinese banks such as Jin Cheng and Mainland, as well as general speculators, also continued to sell, so it continued to loosen. The US exchange rate actually went beyond the 8-yuan mark. At that time, Hong Kong telegraphs sold a large amount of January's forward rate at 4 shillings and 9.0625 pence, which were all absorbed by foreign banks such as HSBC and Yuli. At that time, the spot price of the British gold rate eased to 4 shillings and 9.375 pence, and the US exchange rate also hardened to 8.09375 yuan. After entering, HSBC again absorbed China Merchants Bank's spot US exchange rate at 8.0625 yuan, so the situation gradually calmed down. By the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 9.0625 pence for the British gold rate and 8.03125 yuan for the US exchange rate. The British rate for the rest of this month was 4 shillings and 8.90625 pence, and the US exchange rate was 8 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the spot British gold rate tightened by 125, and the US exchange rate eased by 21875. Futures British hardened by 140625, and American rates depreciated by 25.

### 短景不長 金市下疲 回入四千一百元關

### Short-Lived Prosperity, Gold Market Weakens, Falls Back Below 4,100 Yuan

Yesterday's spot gold OTC market situation: the good times were hard to maintain for long and it relapsed into a selling frenzy. Although a certain major player commissioned a money exchange to bring in more than a thousand taels, due to sluggish real demand from the Hong Kong consortium and the sudden shift from tight to loose foreign exchange, the price ultimately fell by as much as 40 yuan. The morning opened flat at 4,115 yuan, down 7 yuan. Subsequently, due to tight foreign exchange and gold shops buying on behalf of customers, while a certain jewelry store also bought in on behalf of its own group, it once reached a new high for the year of 4,155 yuan. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange market suddenly reversed, and the loose situation immediately appeared. There was selling and outflow, with a certain gold shop and money exchange/securities group competing the most fiercely. Although a certain jewelry store and a certain major player made a concerted effort to absorb a certain amount, the positions eventually felt abundant. By the afternoon, it had shrunk to a low price of 4,078 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange stabilized slightly, the securities group profited by covering short positions, and it rose back by more than ten yuan, but because the gold shop sold again, the evening close was only 4,082 yuan. The trading volume was brisk throughout the day, with about 2,000 taels changing hands. The result for jewelry gold was unchanged, and the customs and others remained flat.

Spot Gold Falls 40 Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened flat. First, a money exchange bought 50 taels from a gold shop for 4,115 yuan, which was down 7 yuan from last Saturday's noon close, but still several yuan higher than the previous day's off-exchange price. Shortly after, the foreign exchange market was quite tight, and buying became strong. The order number was that a certain jewelry store bought on behalf of customers, and for a time there were few sellers, so it jumped by 40 yuan. The money exchange bought 10 taels of spot gold from a gold shop for 4,155 yuan. Then, as foreign exchange loosened, the market turned downwards. A certain money exchange tried hard to sell for the long side, and it immediately fell by 35 yuan. The money exchange sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,120 yuan. At this time, a certain number in the securities group suddenly came to buy in, and at the same time a certain money exchange also brought in some, so it once again rose to 4,135 yuan. After that, because the foreign exchange market hardened, there was an endless stream of sales. Jewelry groups, gold shops, and securities groups all scrambled to sell, and for a time there was no support, so it plummeted by 45 yuan. The money exchange sold 30 taels to the securities group for 4,090 yuan. At that time, the gold shop took advantage of the low price to profit and cover short positions, and it immediately rose by 20 yuan. The securities group bought 10 taels from the money exchange for 4,110 yuan. Later, a certain number in the securities group came again to sell heavily, and it was pressed down again to 4,090 yuan. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market stopped loosening and stabilized slightly, and buying gradually became stronger. A certain securities group and a certain jewelry store and others came to bring in the gold, and it soon rose back by 27 yuan. The securities group bought 10 taels from the gold shop for 4,117 yuan. Later, the jewelry group, a certain number in the securities group, and others came again to sell, and because those bringing in gold were not strong, it gradually fell by 14 yuan. The securities group sold 20 taels to the money exchange for 4,103 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because the foreign exchange market continued to harden, the situation became increasingly weak, and the price opened down by 13 yuan under the selling pressure from the gold shop. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the securities group for 4,090 yuan. Later, it fell another 2 yuan, and money exchanges did 30 taels among themselves for 4,088 yuan. Afterwards, because a certain money exchange bought on behalf of the Hong Kong side, it was pulled up by 17 yuan for a time. The money exchange bought 20 taels from the securities group for 4,105 yuan. After that, the Hong Kong group was satisfied with its fill, and the foreign exchange market continued to loosen, and gold shops and money exchanges came again to sell, and it could no longer be supported and fell. Money exchanges did 20 taels among themselves for 4,078 yuan. Then, as the securities group profited by covering short positions, and the foreign exchange market stopped loosening and stabilized slightly, it rose back by a small 7 yuan. The jewelry group sold 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,095 yuan. Later, because a certain gold shop saw the high price and sold again, it fell again by 13 yuan. The gold shop sold 10 taels to the securities group for 4,082 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell 40 yuan compared to last weekend, with a fluctuation of 77 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold number's own brand gold was several yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold First Rises, Then Falls

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael: initially, the major dealers still hung at 415 yuan. By 9:35 AM, it was raised by 5 yuan, but in less than half an hour it fell back by 5 yuan. After that, there was no change. As a result, the major dealers still hung at 415 yuan. The new dealers had the same price as above, and the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Supply Exceeds Demand, Foreign Currencies Loosen

Yesterday, foreign currencies were initially flat, then loosened. The supply of British and American gold pounds increased, and the market situation tended to loosen. The American gold note was 13.03 yuan in the morning, but due to the strong supply, the market price fell frequently, and the evening market dropped to 12.53 yuan. The supply of Hong Kong notes was also smooth, and the market situation was weak. Singapore notes and Dutch notes were rarely needed, and the market price fell. Canadian notes also fell due to the frequent drop in the American gold note. The demand for Japanese gold notes was slightly strong, and the market situation was slightly firm, with the evening market at 1.27 yuan. Korean notes were weak, with the evening market at 1.075 yuan. Yesterday's market price: British and American gold pounds both fell by 1 yuan, British gold notes fell by 20 cents, American gold notes fell by 30 cents, Hong Kong notes fell by 2 cents, Singapore notes and Dutch notes both fell by 10 cents, Canadian notes fell by 20 cents, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Discount Rate Rises

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange rose slightly. The rate immediately rose to 35 yuan per thousand yuan in the early morning, and then rose further to 37 yuan. (But it soon fell back to 34.5 yuan, and stood firm at 35 yuan in the afternoon, which was up 1 yuan compared to last Saturday. The money industry association's interbank lending rate was still hung at 15 cents in the morning and afternoon.

### Securities 外股創造 新紀錄日 堅昂竟成白熱化

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Create a New Record Day, Firm and High Prices Turn White-Hot

Yesterday's OTC securities market situation was slightly volatile. Because there was quite a bit of profit-taking, the market price was under pressure and the rising wind was slightly frustrated. It was heard that the Nanjing rumors were a tactic to pressure for peace talks, and that the real purpose was to seek peace and a ceasefire. In the morning, buying sentiment was initially very strong and the market price was firm. Later, Xinfu and No. 14 selling off slightly caused some weakness. The afternoon situation was roughly the same as the morning. Xinfu still had some selling, and Dafeng and Tongkang also sold off. However, Lemao, Lianyi, Lianhe, and others were still constantly absorbing, and the market situation was slightly firmer again. The future may go through a short period of volatility before rising again. As a result, apart from Dingzhong, which was down by a small 2 cents, the rest were good by about 1 or 2 cents. The transaction volume was about more than 1 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock trading: 20 shares of Ningbo Shaoxing Shipping Company were traded at a price of 8.2 yuan.

Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Industry Association opened firmly and tensely, reaching a boiling point. As time went on, it became more and more intense, and the emotions of the crowd turned white-hot. All the stocks on the board were scrambling to be taken, so it would not be an exaggeration to call it "New Record Day" since trading began. As noon approached, a reaction suddenly arose. It was a very natural action for lucky longs to settle all their positions in order to obtain the profits they had already earned. The pullback extended in the afternoon. At that time, those most affected were also those who had risen the most during the rising period. The ratios of various high-priced stocks were relatively stable. The trading volume of various stocks was very common, so it is not easy and unnecessary to list the stocks that benefited the most for comparison.

### Food 常幫高粳 始售限價 碎米平價出售

### Food: Chang Gang High-Quality Japonica Rice Begins Sales with Price Limits, Broken Rice Sold at Discounted Prices

Yesterday's inland sources, transferred out of Hongkou, suddenly became sparse, with only three to five hundred bags. The amount of foreign rice arriving was also not large. In the early morning, people's hearts were still floating, and most remained in a wait-and-see attitude, with few inquiring. The merchants also did not lightly sell due to their own capital constraints. The price did not rise or fall under the insistence of the sellers. Near noon, it was heard that foreign exchange continued to shorten, and the cost of foreign rice became heavier, so those who owned foreign rice became firmer in their thinking and were unwilling to sell. Customers also successively made offers, and at this point the market rose. However, because the stock in the warehouses was abundant, it was difficult to fully raise the prices of various goods. If Japonica and National rice only improved by 20 or 30 cents, Chang Gang high-quality Japonica rice began to limit sales to 40 yuan. Various types of foreign rice depended on the transfer of foreign exchange, increasing by 30 to 50 cents compared to the previous market. Only glutinous rice had a large amount of stock in the warehouses and sluggish sales, so it continued to be dumped for more than one yuan.

There was also foreign rice arriving in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's New Beijing ship transported 450 bags from Hong Kong the day before yesterday (the 7th), and the Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship loaded 4,322 bags from Hong Kong. The unloading of both ships was completed yesterday. (Zu)

Also, foreign rice orders are still difficult to reconcile. Wholesale spot goods still need to wait a little longer, but inland rural customers are asking about them, so Saigon No. 1 rice and others have already been raised by 20 or 30 cents. No. 1 rice opens at 36.2 yuan, and original bags for return are still opened at 43.75 yuan. However, there are more orders for broken rice, and the inventory is sufficient. Moreover, the sale of discounted rice has been decided to start on the tenth day of the lunar December according to the old calendar. Several rice shops in the French Concession are selling discounted broken rice (156 catties) for 28 yuan. It is heard that high-quality broken rice in the market is also only sold for 32 yuan, and the price of inferior goods is the same as the discounted price, down by 50 or 60 cents compared to the day before.

### Flour and Wheat Remain Firm

The current flour market is trending firm. Although the price of No. 2 flour mill remains at the original price of 9 yuan, there is a significant difference from the customer price, so the mill is only willing to supply small quantities, and larger quantities are restricted. The total market turnover is less than 10,000 bags. The customer sales price of various brands such as Green Cannon and Tianzhu remains at 9.45 to 9.5 yuan. There is little supply and demand for returned goods, and the price is also similar. The market situation for Japanese flour has improved slightly. The price of Phoenix brand in January reached 9.056 yuan last weekend, and has now returned to around 9.2 yuan. Today, 2,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Hong Kong.

The source of wheat is slightly sporadic. Because the producers' prices are not loose, transportation is very difficult, and most are unwilling to lightly sell. Also, according to foreign firm news, the Australian government is planning to restrict wheat production, and the exchange rate fluctuates greatly, so it is feared that it will be difficult to start ordering wheat in the future, so people's hearts are still firm and the selling price is difficult to lower. Changxi wheat is still standing at the original price of 15.5 yuan, with 2,000 bags taken by Fufeng Factory and 300 bags taken by Fuxin Factory. It is heard that there was also a transaction of a tube of warehouse receipts in the market, with the Changzhou wheat price opened at 14.7 yuan.

### Coarse Grains Yellow Soybeans Continue to Rise by More Than One Corner

The yellow soybean market situation: due to transportation difficulties and high costs, the source of high-quality goods is scarce, and most are mid-to-low-quality goods, so the landed price is firm and the market price rises more and falls less. Yesterday's market continued to rise by more than one corner, with over 1,600 bags of Dingjiazhou beans opened at a price of 18 to 18.5 yuan, 2 cars of Nanjing beans at a price of 17 to 17.15 yuan, 300 bags of Wuhu beans at a price of 18.1 yuan, over 100 bags of Taicang beans at a price of 18.2 yuan, and 37 bags of Chongming sand yellow at a price of 18.4 yuan, 50 bags of Pinghu Doudou at a price of 20.9 yuan.

Imported raw oil: 1,690 cans arrived from Qingdao yesterday. Today (the 9th), 1,600 bags of beans, 400 bags of peanuts, 5,090 bags of raw kernels, 4,500 cans of raw oil, and 70 items are being transported to Hong Kong.

### Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Uninspired, Cotton Sales Quiet

The transaction of native cotton has turned quiet. Factories need to lower prices and cannot bear it, which is really due to the lack of yarn sales and the uninspired market price. As a result, the buying interest is not healthy. Only Qingdao's Japanese factories have some purchases and shipments, so the market situation is still stable. Currently, the cotton market is restricted because the yarn price has a tendency to decrease, and the raw cotton, which is related to it, is of course restricted. From the source in northern Jiangsu, 4,068 bags of Tonghua and 942 bags of Changyinsha arrived in two days. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.

Fire Machine Flower 162.00 Transactions among merchants 150 bags

Fire Machine Flower 163.00 Also 160 bags

Fire Machine Wooden Frame 164.00 Also 150 bags

Fire Machine 163.50 Also 140 bags

Chong Tong 166.25 150 bags

Fire Machine Wooden Frame 162.00 Also 150 bags

American Cotton 177.00 Also 100 bags

Tongzhou 172.00 Also 1,000 bags

Also 171.50 Also 300 bags

American 176.00 Also 200 bags

In addition, the market price of foreign cotton: the New York cotton market opened firm yesterday morning, first due to purchases by speculators, then due to enthusiastic purchases by the industry and some short covering. As a result, the closing price increased by 20 points for the near term and more than 10 points for the long term. The Indian market, including forecasts, increased by 2 rupees, and the Egyptian market increased by more than 20 points. Liverpool was closed.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai is still extremely quiet. They are deeply afraid that there will be changes in the exchange rate. However, various opinions are unanimously optimistic about the overseas cotton market, and the intention for American cotton is especially firm. Therefore, trading New York American cotton New York futures among peers is very prosperous. The Japanese factory also has a high opinion on American cotton. The price of yesterday's cotton market converted to a factory delivery price using the American exchange rate of 8 yuan is as follows.

20 counts American Metlin 238.20

Also Lower Grade 233.95

32 counts Also 245.05

Also Lower Grade 239.05

42 counts Also 248.45

Also Lower Grade 240.75

### Sellers Congregated, Yarn Market Wanted to Rise but Fell

The yarn market first rose and then fell, and the trend is weakening. Because customer sales have stagnated, and the stock in the hands of hoarders has increased. As for the foreign exchange situation, there is also a kind of fluctuating situation. In this short period of time, there will not be a new posture found. However, although the thinking of the general industry is strong, time in and time out, it is all January and February futures, and the trading of 20-count Shuangma is very lively. The transaction of current yarn has almost completely stopped. It is found that the Hong Kong gang only took care of 10 bags of cotton yarn, and the industry's skin ball transaction was said to be outside of 1,200 bags.

The current yarn morning opening continued the firm gas of the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 740 yuan. However, as soon as this price opened, sellers gathered, and the general flow of scalpers, seeing that the chips in the market were abundant, the public were shorting the heads. The market price turned downwards again. It was heard that the foreign exchange was shortening and lengthening again, and people's hearts were even more empty, and real sales were even more sluggish. It fell directly to 727 yuan at the close. The transaction statistics for half a day were 1,385 bags. The market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 1 yuan, Tiannv fell by 2 yuan, and Shuangdiqiu fell by 2 yuan. Today, 10 pieces of yarn are being transported to Hong Kong. The amount of each gang that bought is divided as follows.

Industry 1,210 Mainland 70

Tianjin 75 Hong Kong 10

Statistics 1,385

### Textiles 实销仍佳

### Textiles: Actual Sales of Cotton Cloth Still Good

Cotton cloth: the market mentality and business are not prosperous due to the unstable exchange rate, but the actual sales situation is very good, so the market situation is first weak and then firm. White cloth and coarse cloth of heavy weight increased by 10 to 20 cents per bolt, and light weight was flat. Scattered lots of ready-made fine cloth were sold cheaply at 10 to 25 cents per bolt. The increase and decrease of fine twill were mixed. The prices of bleached, dyed, and printed cloths were all firm due to the continued increase in processing fees. The North Road Tianjin and Yantai gangs took care of more than 200 pieces of blue cloth and fine cloth, and the Nanyang gang took care of more than 10,000 bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth. In this street, more than 500 pieces of fine twill, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, fine cord, and printed cloth were transacted. The Sichuan and Yunnan gangs took care of more than 5,000 bolts of colored cloth, line flannel, and colored twill, and the Zhejiang and Jiangxi gangs took care of 70 to 80 pieces of bleached cloth, fine cloth, and twill. On the 9th, 47 pieces of textiles were transported to Hong Kong.

Dongbu cloth rose in the morning and weakened at noon. When the market closed, fine cloth rebounded, resembling the sales situation of the previous week. Fine twill decreased slightly by 5 to 10 cents per bolt. The spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached a peak of 22.25 yuan in the morning, and once fell to 21.8 yuan in the afternoon. The closing price rose back to 22.05 yuan. More than 700 pieces of fine cloth were transacted in this street. The opening price of Four Gentlemen Serge was 67.5 cents per yard in the morning, and also fell to around 67 cents afterwards, because customer sales were not prosperous and transactions were few.

### 平厚呢下檔見俏

### Smooth Thick Wool Fabric Lower Grades Are Popular

Smooth thick wool fabric sales are still good, and the lower grades, from 7 to 8 yuan up to less than 10 yuan, are even more popular. Yuan color is especially good, because uniform manufacturers are coming one after another. The price of overcoat wool fabric is high, so this is the only choice. Although the need for thick smooth wool fabric is lively, it is not as popular as the lower grades.

### Silk and Tea 絲市前途 關係微妙

### Silk and Tea: The Future of the Silk Market is Subtly Related

After the opening of customs, the silk market in Japan and the United States once showed a decline. At the same time, according to the New York silk statistics for last month, it was felt that the New York silk market in December, regardless of imports, sales, or stocks, had shrunk compared to the previous month and the same month of the previous year, so some people generally believed that the foundation of the recent high silk price was very fragile, and therefore predicted that the silk price would gradually return. However, yesterday the Yokohama silk market rose sharply again, with spot at 2,320 yuan, up 40 yuan, near-term at 2,320 yuan up 90 yuan, and long-term at 2,360 yuan up 61 yuan. At present, the rise and fall of the silk price cannot be regarded as a single cause or phenomenon. Because war has caused production to shrink, and at the same time caused prices to soar, raw silk is no exception, and will follow this trend to become deeper and deeper. Moreover, silk is especially subtly related to the commercial treaties of Japan and the United States, and the changes are very complicated. The local silk market is in a firm and stable state, with the price of European sales of white factory at 6,300 yuan, with only 5 piculs transacted. Qianjin Silk, printed and sold by White Head Foreign Firm, opened yesterday at 80 piculs, with the price up 20 yuan, and the selling price was 1,820 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Shows Slight Easing

Yesterday, foreign sugar saw an increase due to foreign exchange rates, showing a slight decrease. The association's price was fixed at $58.50 for spot coarse white sugar from domestic warehouses, $58 for newly arrived sugar from foreign warehouses, $57.80 to $57.70, and a small amount at $0.50 for old stock, $47 for re-export sugar, a small amount at $1. The Swire Crystal White B mark was $59 at the eastern warehouse and $59.50 at the western warehouse, up $0.20, with the remainder subject to rebate. The H mark was slightly tight, $43.80 at the western warehouse and $43.50 at the eastern warehouse. Dutch Red was a small amount at $0.50, MP mark at $45.50, WA mark at $45. Native cotton white No. 1 was $57.50, No. 2 was $57, a small amount at $0.50. Native ice sugar prices remained the same, No. 1 at $68, No. 2 at $67.50, crystal clear ice at $69.50. According to customer telegrams, native brown sugar should be temporarily held and not exchanged, so the market is tightening again. Yesterday, several dozen bags of Swire ship cargo were released, rising again to $45. Ordinary Huizhou White was $53.80. Five thousand bags of sugar arrived from the Netherlands on the 8th, and 570 bags from Hong Kong.

### Dried Goods: Spring Round Logans Face Renewed Obstruction

Due to the obstruction of ships going to Quanzhou, the source of assorted longans has been cut off again. Now only Zhangzhou has a small amount of goods arriving. However, because the production price is not very suitable, the arrival of goods is extremely scarce. It was found that the number of Xinjiang wheel shipments last Friday was less than ten boxes. The price is still expected to continue to tighten.

### Coal: Vietnamese Coal Rises Another Seven Dollars

Since the beginning of the year, each type of bituminous coal has been affected by Kai Ping, and high-grade goods have been above $100, making it difficult for shops and stores to start. Secondary goods took the opportunity to rise and sell very well. Yesterday, Vietnamese coal was unpacked by the trade, rising another $7 per ton. According to the warehouse, Vietnamese general coal is $75 per ton from the car, with additional handling fees for delivery.

### Hardware: Tinplate Market Sluggish

The tinplate market was previously prosperous in trading, and prices rose. Recently, however, yarn factories and rolling mills have not had much interest, causing the market to become sluggish. Currently, 24-gauge goods sell for $800 per box, and 26-gauge goods sell for $320 per box, both of which are more than $100 lower than before.

Short Talks

### How to Talk?

— Huang Jiayin

What to talk about in the Free Talk section was roughly mentioned last time. Now, it's time to discuss how to talk.

More than three years ago, Mr. Lin Yutang introduced the term "Western magazine article" to the Chinese publishing industry. This term was quite unfamiliar in China at the time, almost with a sense of mystery. Later, some translated articles of Western magazine articles were often published in magazines, and everyone gradually understood what Western magazine articles were, and also expressed warm welcome to them.

Western magazine articles represent a free style of writing, with no fixed style as the style. Precisely because there is no fixed writing style, it reveals a lively and natural writing style.

The good thing about Western magazine articles is that the content is rich, the words are meaningful, not perfunctory, not irresponsible, and the style is as lively as close friends talking heart to heart, full of fun.

This forms an interesting contrast with the attitude of some magazines and newspapers in China, which put on a serious face to teach. The stereotyped articles are boring and make people厭厭, writing them is equivalent to not writing.

Foreign authors often spend a lot of time writing an article, doing on-the-spot investigation, looking through reference books, and interviewing relevant people, and then organizing the materials obtained, so they can write rich feature articles. It is not to say that every Western magazine article is so good, but we think this point is what we should humbly learn.

In this regard, we hope that Free Talk can be a pioneer and take this path. We hope that every article, no matter how long or short, will be meaningful. We hope that every author will practice the words "Free Talk" when writing articles.

How to talk? Free Talk, but please don't talk nonsense!

Science

### Scientists Mobilize

— Mo Ming

In a well-organized country, every citizen has the opportunity to dedicate himself to serving the country during wartime, especially scientists, who can be said to be an extremely important force in the nation's entire war effort. After the outbreak of this European war, many British scientists rose up and voluntarily requested the government to assign wartime service work. It is said that the number of registered people recently has reached more than 10,000, all waiting for the government to allocate research topics according to their respective specialties.

War can sometimes be the best stimulant for science, and many scientific inventions are not easily successful in peacetime. The most urgently needed invention in this war is a luminescent substance for use in basements during blackouts. There is also a "light filter" to prevent light from leaking out of the room, which are all necessary equipment for air defense. In addition, due to the shortage of gasoline sources, the increase in the efficiency of aircraft and automobile engines and the improvement of fuel are also extremely important issues. The invention of an extremely light metal can greatly expand the power of aircraft; the invention of an extremely violent explosive, of course, is more practical for war. There are many other important studies that are being actively carried out by specialized scientists.

In case too many people are mobilized and there is not enough research work to allocate, the government is determined not to repeat the mistakes of 1914, allowing groups of talented and outstanding young scientists to join the army out of righteous indignation, only to be tragically destroyed by the ruthless artillery fire and bullets. The most famous victim in the First World War was physicist Moseley, who was only twenty-eight years old and had a brilliant and promising future in X-ray research. Even now, the scientific community still feels deeply sorry for this matter.

There is also a magnificent potential force in the British "scientist army," which is the many Jewish refugees who have been exiled from Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. They are all specialized talents with unusually rich knowledge and experience, and they will surely make great contributions to the countries fighting for justice.

In Germany, the situation is just the opposite. During the First World War, a "non-Aryan" scientist named Fritz Haber invented the great nitrogen synthesis method, which solved Germany's explosive panic, allowing her to continue to support herself on the battlefield for a long time. However, this great contributor was later inevitably subjected to the cruel treatment of the Nazi rulers, so that he suffered from wandering in a foreign land in his later years and died in Switzerland in 1934. Now, the extent of Germany's wartime resource depletion is no less than it was during the last World War, but many Habers have long been voluntarily sent away by Hitler.

Professor J. C. Philip, chairman of the industrial chemistry department of the Scientists' Central Registration Office, expressed optimism about the war, believing that Britain also has a great advantage in terms of the strength of the scientific army. Someone asked him what amazing performances scientists would have in this war. He smiled and replied: "The last World War was when chemists invented poison gas, which caused a sensation for a while. Now, I'm afraid it's time for physicists to show their skills!"

Essays

### Gifts

— Lei Xing

Without the red candles of New Year's Eve to render a lively atmosphere, the quiet night becomes the interval between years.

In the early morning, faint sunlight shines on the table. The empty calendar rack is full of thick piles again. It quietly tells me a message: "1940 is here." "Another year." Casting back with an inquiring gaze, I muttered to myself blankly.

A friend sent a gift: a half-inch long glass camel. It was like a oar brushing across the lake of my memory, rippling a circle of childhood ripples. I smiled knowingly.

There is also a short note: "The camel is a product of the sandy land. It carries heavy loads and trudges, enduring hunger and thirst to rush to a distant journey. That perseverance is what we should remember. Now, a new string of days is placed in front of you. Are you welcoming it with joy or sighing? You know, living is difficult. And living in this cold world requires even more courage and perseverance to fight. Be a camel, go to the desert and I will find your oasis. If you put this little thing on your desk, will you remember the kind camel bell sound? A sound can carry nearly an inch of return journey."

What makes me dazed is the seemingly irrelevant tail. Ah, the sound of camel bells. I miss the days in the north. I am already tired of the life in this city, which lacks the essential elements to make life happy: a kind of mood or a little flavor.

But good dreams have gone with the flowing water, and I can't go home. The ancient city has suffocated. Silently, the sun climbed one step past. How will I grasp these flying days?

Anecdotes

### The Qualification to Be Killed

— Kong Siwen

British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has been traveling between Shanghai and Chongqing recently, with great haste. He is probably one of the busiest people in the world.

Someone asked Ambassador Kerr how he came to China in the first place. He said that Eden, the then British Foreign Secretary, was a good friend of his. He was originally a minister in Iraq, where his official duties were very leisurely. He asked Eden to send him to a place where there was more to do. Unexpectedly, Eden listened to him and sent him to China. Being a diplomat in China can be said to have no free time. Ambassador Kerr said here, saying: "I really got it! I really got it!" There is a great sense of "being fooled! Being fooled!"

Kerr is a talkative and humorous person. After the outbreak of this European war, several British youths volunteered to return home to serve as reservists, preparing to participate in the European war. A friend smiled and asked Kerr: "Are you going?" He replied half-seriously and half-jokingly: "They are just the right age to be killed. I am too old and do not have the qualification to be killed." The humor is mixed with great pain.

### Northern Kunling Decides to Review (Part 1)

— Shao

Prelude

Kunling is now as "popular" as famous actors. This trend started in Jiangnan, but recently it is also the case in the north. There is a great half of the world of Kunling.

Talk about the past first

Before Chen Delin and Yang Xiaolou died, although they were in their sixties, they still relied on their old age to sell their seniority, and they could make money by relying on the word "old" precisely because they were male actors. Kun actors, on the other hand, change slightly every five years and greatly every ten years. Their reputation and status change infinitely with age. Speaking of the Kun actors in the north, Jin Shaomei, Qin Xuefang, and Bi Yunxia were an era; after Shaomei and Xuefang, it was Zhang Eyun, Xin Yanqiu, Hua Huilin, and Du Liyun. Among these four people, Eyun and Yanqiu's art is more than twice as good as Huilin and Liyun. Now Liyun has long been named and Huilin has lived in Jiangnan for a long time and does not often appear on stage. Among the Kun actors in the north, in terms of qualifications, it can be said that each has its own merits. Eyun is better at martial arts actresses and flower actresses, and Yanqiu is good at acting in Tsing Yi plays. However, Eyun has good luck, so for several years, Zhang Eyun seems to be more popular than Xin Yanqiu. In recent years, Xin Yanqiu has not often performed, and Eyun has come to the south several times, and Eyun's limelight has become stronger than hers invisibly. After them, Lu Sujuan is the only popular person who has risen. Sujuan has the reputation of "the first beauty", and she became popular because of her beauty. Her art cannot be compared with Zhang Wang. From 1933 to 1937, it was Lu Sujuan's golden age. Now she has been taken in by a banker in a golden house. Outside of Sujuan, there is also Liang Xiujuan, who was also popular for a while. Now Xiujuan is also a wife. These have become figures of the past era.

Talk about the present again

The Kun actors who are popular in the north now can be divided into two factions, one is to make money with real art, and the other is to call for money with social skills; those who make money with real art include Wang Yurong and Zhao Xiaolan. Yurong and Xiaolan both rely on a good voice and use singing as a gimmick. Yurong is a disciple of Wang Yaoqing, and Xiaolan is a disciple of Shang Xiaoyun. Xiaolan learns Xiaoyun too much. Although she can sing, her accent is too vulgar and her words are not very pleasant to the ear. Yurong, on the other hand, was personally taught by Yaoqing. Yaoqing really used her brains to teach her plays, and she also worked hard to learn the plays. In the past five years, she has achieved some achievements in art. Moreover, she has several dozen well-costumed plays in her stomach. She has good supporting actors and good fans. In addition, Yurong is versatile and good at socializing; therefore, she has become the most popular Kun actor in the north. As for those who call for money with social skills, they are Wu Suqiu and Zhao Jinrong. Wu and Zhao are both leading actors in the north. Wu Suqiu is indeed a smart child, but her acting path is too mixed. She is equipped with plays by Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, and she also performs plays such as "Baluo and", "Spinning Cotton", and "Human Face Peach Blossom" that the four famous actors do not perform, making the audience confused. However, her appearance is quite good and she is good at acting. This is her good point. Zhao Jinrong's art is actually better than Suqiu's. In the drama school, she was originally the only female actor talent, but after leaving school, she was not as good as she was in school. The biggest problem is that her voice cannot be guaranteed. However, Jinrong's foundation is good, and if she can do well, there is still hope for the future. Unfortunately, she is now more focused on socializing than on reality.

Listening to Guan Dayuan sing "Scolding Cao" on New Year's Day

It is not pleasant to listen to the play of Drum Scolding Cao on New Year's Day! That night, I listened to her singing very well, especially unexpectedly happy. Guan Dayuan is a rather old actor. She has not come to Shanghai to perform for more than ten years. She has been on stage at the renewal for more than half a month now. I heard that the reputation is still good. I watched her fight Taiping the other day. Her posture with the halberd has its merits, but I was not satisfied with the singing. Now, I listened to her Drum Scolding Cao, which is based on the Tan school and does not deviate from the general score. However, there are slight differences in the wording, and it does not contain the sad and sad tone of the current trend. It can be proved that her foundation is very deep, she is upright and does not bother to imitate others to please the times. I have tried to test that Mi Zhengping died at the hands of Huang Zu at the age of only twenty-four. He was only twenty-three years old when he saw Cao Cao. He was energetic and arrogant. When the current so-called Tan school famous actors sing this, they deliberately make a sound of dying autumn, without any vigor. It is straight as an old man who is about to decay, how can it be Mi Zhengping who scolds Cao at the risk of his life? The singer has never dreamed of Mi Zheng's shadow, which is a great disease of opera. In the early years of the Republic of China, I watched Tan Xinpei sing this play in Ping. At that time, Tan was already more than seventy years old. Although the drum skills were good, I still felt that the singing was not satisfactory. Later, I saw Luo Xiaobao perform this at the Gong Wu Stage. His power was still strong enough to watch. Now, I see Dayuan's play, which can be compared with Xiaobao. It is not perfect, but it is better than others who are weak and use crying as scolding. If he has a good voice, then his achievements will be more than this. Listening to the "xiang" character of "丞相" and the "kaixiao" two characters of "怎開消" are very satisfactory. The "er" character of "駡賊名兒" is a single cavity, not very exquisite. Watching him beat the drums, his right wrist is very active, and his left wrist does not match. The tao dianzi of the three drum passes and the jiejiegao of the night deep are not boutiques. This is the general idea.

### European Situation

— Qi Hua

Since the opening of the European war, the production policies of Hollywood film companies have been quite hesitant: on the one hand, they are unwilling to give up lighthearted love comedies, and at the same time, they are also concerned about the needs of the market. "Entertainment Circle" published a translation last year, and the Hollywood producers with "business eyes" are very clever to take both approaches. At the same time, these two types of films are being produced. "European Situation" was the earliest to be completed.

Under such circumstances, the "European Situation" produced naturally did not directly touch on the internal causes of the war, nor did it make an accurate perspective. Like other "spy films," it only narrates the struggle of spies from the belligerent countries.

However, the director's handling skills are very clever. After the first new machine crashed, it unfolded intricately, Scottish Detective Han Meng engaged in the investigation of secrets; driver Tony's suspicion; and the enemy assassinated the spy because there was no new discovery on the plane; at the same time, it was also interspersed with a romance between a female reporter and Tony. Under the cross development of these several aspects, the director was able to handle them in a layered manner without the disadvantages of attending to one thing and losing sight of the other, and also tightly grasped the upsurge of the climax. At the same time, in order to adjust the dryness, he poured a very strong interest into the role of Han Meng.

Laurence Voss's Allie Tony is only competent. Ralph Richardson's Han Meng, reversing the style of "Four Feathers", can be said to be very brilliant in playing such a humorous role.
