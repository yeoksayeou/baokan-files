Chongqing: Today, the Chinese military spokesperson strongly refuted the Japanese claim of voluntarily withdrawing from Nanning, saying that the Japanese army's position in Nanning was already untenable after the Chinese counter-offensive. The spokesperson expressed the opinion that the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning might suggest a Japanese plan to concentrate efforts on their southward advance. (30th Reuters dispatch)

After being besieged by the Chinese army day and night, most of them have already dispersed, and some have retreated into Qinzhou and other places in Guangdong Province. Their destination seems to be Hainan Island. From then on, the position of the Japanese army in southwestern Guangxi and Guangdong provinces will be quite difficult. (30th Havas dispatch)

Washington: The Washington Evening Star newspaper published a commentary yesterday, stating that the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning indicates that China is strong enough to drive the Japanese out of important strongholds. According to Japanese claims, the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning was purely voluntary because the occupation of Nanning had become meaningless after the Japanese army entered Vietnam. The Evening Star reported that the Japanese army occupied this important town in Guangxi on November 24, 1939. The Evening Star stated that the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning and the Chinese army's reoccupation of the city have aroused great interest in the United States this week. The occurrence of this event indicates that the Chinese side, having obtained continued credit loans from the United States and military supplies transported in via the Burma Road, has been able to prolong the war, causing Japan to abandon its risky war due to economic exhaustion. Undoubtedly, if China lives the life of islanders in central Asia for one day, Japan will not be able to fulfill its threatening ability to the Western interests in the Far East for one day.

Editorial

### Sino-Japanese War Situation and the Far East Situation

The flames of the European War are spreading towards the Balkan Peninsula. The conditions stipulated in Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact, that each signatory country must assist each other under new circumstances, will first be tested here. Although Japan already has a tendency to evade its obligations, in any case, the expansion of the European War and unrest on the western border of the Soviet Union are things that the Japanese side cannot wish for today, because that is precisely a favorable opportunity for it to engage in new speculation and adventures in the Far East. Therefore, the battle results of the Chinese army in recovering famous cities in the southeast and two battlefields have great significance for the increasingly turbulent Far East crisis.

Japan's southward attempt is, of course, to remedy the failure of the invasion of China, and at the same time, it is sufficient to make its attention and strength on the invasion of China more dispersed. A certain Japanese political theorist previously criticized the Japanese for their fickle-mindedness, talking about going south before the invasion of China had any results. Because Japan's current resources and strength do not allow it to carry out the invasion of China and the south at the same time. And if the southward advance succeeds, it will reduce the Japanese interest in invading China. If it suffers setbacks, it will inevitably increase the downturn in the intention to fight China. The situation shown in the recent Sino-Japanese war situation is sufficient to prove the accuracy of the latter assumption, because the Japanese army's encounters on the Chinese battlefield are following the setbacks in its southward activities.

Judging from the war situation over the past six months, since the central Hubei campaign in the spring and summer, there have been relatively few large-scale strategic battles. The Japanese claim to invade Sichuan and Yunnan are nothing more than empty words. The so-called autumn offensive is only a strategic embellishment for the so-called mopping-up operations in southern Anhui and western Zhejiang. The Chinese army's counterattack has achieved significant results at this time. The eastern battlefield has recovered Jingxian, Lin'an, Zhuji, and even Shaoxing, an important town in eastern Zhejiang. The southern battlefield has recovered Nanning and Longzhou Mingjiang Suilu and other places, the inland invasion bases that the Japanese army has held for years. The nature of these two battles is different, the former is the contest between "mopping up" and "counter-mopping up", the latter is the competition for strategic strongholds, but they are both major achievements of the Chinese army's strategy and tactics. It proves that the Japanese army is not only unable to defend the newly occupied cities, which is very different from the previous attack, that is, immediately build fortifications, engage in a desperate defense, and even the important bases that have been operated for a long time cannot be guaranteed. It opens a new era in which the Chinese army recovered important towns in the past three years. The ratio of strength between the two armies, the situation of attack and defense, should all be estimated with new scales from now on. The effectiveness of the Chinese counterattack, especially in southern Guangxi, is also a major blow to the Japanese southward attempt.

The Japanese invasion of southern Guangxi last winter was originally a manifestation of a two-pronged policy. On the one hand, they wanted to use the Qinfang Yongning stronghold to prepare to invade the southwest hinterland. On the other hand, they just used it as a pretext to look south into Vietnam. At that time, China repeatedly urged the countries concerned to pay attention, but the French-Vietnamese authorities remained ignorant, procrastinated, and made mistakes, and never prepared for it before the defeat in Europe. Eventually, French-Vietnamese rights and interests suffered significant damage not long ago, and this crisis is still continuing to grow. After Japan advanced into northern Vietnam, the Yonglong stronghold had already reduced its role in invading Vietnam, but whether the Japanese continued to advance south or invade west, the Guangxi area of Yonglong was a very valuable rear, enough to be a strategic point with the Haiphong-Hanoi line, and it has significant strategic and transportation significance. Therefore, if it is said that the Japanese army may as well abandon Yonglong because the Vietnam negotiations have been resolved, it is obviously just a rhetoric to cover up the defeat, just like the previous battles in northern Hunan and northern Hubei. After Yonglong returns to Chinese control, not only can Yunnan be spared the danger of being attacked on both sides, but the Chinese army's position in southern Guangxi is also sufficient to pose a new threat. Although the Japanese Navy is still intact and the results of its secret shipbuilding over the past three years and the performance of its new ships that have been launched are not known to outsiders, there is indeed reason to believe that the fact that the invading Japanese army has shown a shortage of military power and has suffered repeated defeats shows that even if the Japanese Navy is well equipped, its actual combat power may not be very different from its troops in China, because it is equally subject to economic resources. The reserves and supplements of manpower and material resources it needs have exceeded the actual capabilities of Japan, which is nearing exhaustion. If it is said that after the invading Chinese army has suffered repeated defeats, it can only rely on its naval strength to complete the southern dream by taking advantage of the opportunity of the expansion of the European War, it is difficult to believe.

The recent victory of the Chinese army's counterattack has indeed proved that China's war of resistance against aggression and the tough policies of Britain and the United States are the basic elements for stabilizing the Far East, and the more successful China is militarily, the more the Far East crisis will decrease. Recently, Japan has encountered setbacks in all aspects. Whether it will combine new military offensives and political offensives to seek a solution to the "China Incident," or turn to use the new international situation to expand its adventures, although it can be asserted that it will be difficult for it to succeed easily, it is something that all relevant parties at home and abroad should pay close attention to.

Two of the Passengers Were Journalists

Chongqing: American pilot Kent of China Airlines, jointly operated by China and the United States, was shot down by Japanese aircraft while flying the Chongqing plane from Chongqing to Kunming yesterday, resulting in his death. There were twelve people on board, including nine passengers, the co-pilot, and a female cadre each. It is feared that many of the others also died. Among them were two famous young Chinese journalists, one was Fan Changjiang, who is currently affiliated with Dagongbao, and the other was Lu Yijun (transliteration), a local correspondent for Xinhua Daily, which is run by the Communist Party of China. Kent was known for his calmness. After Kunming issued an air raid alert, Kent decided to fly the plane back to a temporary landing field in Sichuan Province, but because the field was not suitable for landing, he flew back to Kunming. After entering Kunming, he was attacked by Japanese aircraft in northern Kunming. Kent sent a radio message saying, "The plane is under attack by Japanese aircraft, and he is trying to land." This was Kent's last message. Later, China Airlines learned that the plane had been destroyed and Kent had died. A total of two people survived. As of this morning, Chongqing has not yet received a detailed report. It is found that on the 26th of this month, a Eurasia Airlines aircraft was shot down by Japanese aircraft near Kunming, so two passenger planes have been attacked in one week. (30th Reuters dispatch)

### Solid Foundation for China's Wartime Finance

Moscow: The latest issue of the "World Politics and Economy" magazine published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences contains an article by Luo Guofu, former TASS correspondent in China, entitled "China's Wartime Finance." The author stated that the expenses required for the Japanese war are several times greater than those of China. It is generally recognized that Japan is in financial difficulty, and that China's financial situation is relatively stable is due to several purely "Chinese mysteries." The author explained that this situation is due to the fact that every financial measure of the National Government is supported by the people of the whole country. Therefore, it is able to overcome all the difficulties that arise during the war. The abundant resources and large savings owned by the government and the people enable China under the rule of the National Government to extend its cooperation in the war. It is further said that China's savings are several times greater than those of Japan. According to the expectations of Chinese and foreign experts, China's silver reserves are sufficient to maintain three or five years of war. Regarding the various financial measures adopted by the Chinese government, the author pointed out that these measures are sufficient to stabilize China's legal tender and make Japan's attempt to circulate banknotes issued by illegal banks fail. The author concluded that the firm and lasting nature of China's national liberation war and the strengthening of national unity enable China's vast resources to be fully and advantageously used, thereby strengthening the economic foundation of the national liberation struggle.

### Bravely Resisting a Formidable Enemy: Greek Forces Firmly Defend Original Positions; Italian Mechanized Units Find No Purchase; British Navy Lays Mines in Greek Territorial Waters

Reliable sources in Athens report that Greek mountain troops today repulsed modern Italian mechanized units. Covert units, mimicking Chinese guerrilla tactics, are inflicting significant hardship on retreating Italian forces. Despite relentless bombing by Italian aircraft, Greek forces maintain their entire original front line, indicating the failure of Italian attempts to breach Greek resistance. Furthermore, Greek General Headquarters officials state they deeply assess that the main Italian force has yet to advance, instead seeking the weakest point in the Greek defense. Currently, Greek forces are holding off the Italians on land. The British fleet, reportedly steaming north from its Mediterranean base, is poised to engage the Italian navy. (United Press dispatch, 30th)

An Athens Greek General Headquarters communiqué states that small Italian units attacked Greek positions on Monday evening. On Tuesday, heavy and light artillery continued the assault. Greek forces are operating according to prearranged plans. There have been no changes on the West Macedonian front. There was minimal air activity on Tuesday evening. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

London: According to Athens radio reports, British naval vessels have approached. The Admiralty has declared that strategically important Greek territorial waters, such as the Gulfs of Patras, Corinth, and Aegina, have been mined. Military sources here report that the main Italian offensive in Greece is developing along the coastal area of Konispol. The currently ascertainable Italian force numbers two infantry divisions. Greek coastal outposts have been attacked. As of noon yesterday, Italian forces were reported to have penetrated eight kilometers into Greek territory at Filasteonistra.

There is no confirmation of reports that Italian forces have landed on various Greek islands. No British forces are stationed there. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Athens: Greek frontline defenders are reportedly retreating along the entire Albanian border. Yesterday, Britain urgently dispatched naval aircraft to provide support, heavily bombing the Italian-held island of Matzaro, part of the Dodecanese archipelago. This island serves as the closest Italian air base to Athens and a springboard for yesterday's Italian air raids on Greece. The British formally declared that the bombing of the island by British naval aircraft constitutes an act of British aid to Greece. This announcement marks the first such instance. Athenian morale is high. However, reliable sources report that the Greek frontline along the Albanian border is buckling under the intense assault of Italian mechanized units. The advancing Italian force of 200,000 has penetrated an average of six miles into Greek territory. It is also reported that Italian vehicles have advanced ten miles at one point. The Italian vanguard is advancing towards Mörsiah, Petra, and Ioannina. Italian Alpine troops, attacking Florina, engaged in fierce fighting with Greek soldiers in kilts. Florina, an important railway junction, is clearly a prime Italian target. Since Monday, Florina has been subjected to artillery and air bombardment, with Italian bombers leading the way, followed by long-range artillery support. Although the first line of Greek defense has begun to collapse, Greek High Command remains satisfied with the progress of military operations in the north. Official reports yesterday stated that the country is "determined to fully aid Greece." Athens was not attacked today. (International News Service dispatch, 30th)

Rome: According to information from Tirana, Italian forces breached the Greek defensive line in southeastern Albania yesterday afternoon.

Following behind are packs of mules transporting mountain guns and ammunition to the front. It is also reported that Italian forces have landed on various islands near the Greek coast. While detailed information is lacking, it is widely believed that Italian forces are attacking other Greek islands, the names of which are being withheld due to military secrecy. (United Press dispatch, 30th)

### British Naval Aircraft Heavily Attack the Dodecanese Islands

(International News Service dispatch, 30th)

Athens: This morning, Greek army sources stated that several British warships had arrived in Greek territorial waters, but did not disclose which units of the British Mediterranean Fleet had been mobilized in the Near East.

### Greek Military Targets Bombed by Italian Air Force

Rome: The first official Italian communiqué regarding the war with Greece was released at noon yesterday. The communiqué stated, "At dawn on Monday, our forces concentrated in Albania crossed the Greek border and penetrated several key points in enemy territory. They are continuing to advance. Despite the adverse weather, our air force has been ordered to repeatedly bomb military targets, hitting dockyards, harbors, and railway facilities. Multiple fires broke out in the port of Patras.

### Difficult Terrain in Greece Hinders Italian Advance

Vichy: Political circles here are keenly interested in the developments of the Italian-Greek war. They note that for two thousand years, Roman armies have attempted to cross the mountainous Adriatic coastline and invade the Macedonian plains to control the Aegean Sea. This is their second attempt. The Italian-Greek border, stretching over a hundred miles from the Adriatic Sea to the Yugoslav border, is entirely mountainous. The Italian army can only launch an offensive along two routes: (1) along the northeastern route of the Greek Pindus Mountains, directly towards Thessaloniki. In this way, the Albanian cities of Vlorë and Argyrokastro, and the entire province, would form a straight line, allowing entry into the Macedonian plains via the Vistritsa River valley; (2) along the coastal road through Ioannina and the Epirus province, directly towards the Gulf of Corinth. There are no other accessible routes. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

It is claimed that Hitler was unaware of the Italian invasion of Greece beforehand and does not particularly want to see Greece occupied by Italy. The *New York Times*' correspondent in the Yugoslav capital reports that Berlin believes the Italian-Greek conflict is premature and is concerned about Greece's courageous resistance and Turkey's eventual intervention.

### Greek Morale High; Nation Committed to Defending Territory

Athens: Yesterday, Athens was abuzz with war preparations as the people expressed their determination to defend their country. Anti-Italian sentiment was extremely high after the Security Department announced that Italian aircraft had bombed the port of Patras on Sunday, killing over five thousand and injuring more than one hundred. As Greece entered its second day of war yesterday, Athenians filled the streets of the capital, cheering government and military officials. Residents of Athens were awakened at dawn yesterday, not by air raid sirens as on Monday, but by the cheers of crowds gathered in the squares around the Royal Palace, celebrating the arrival of officers and government officials in Athens. King George II, wearing the uniform of the Greek army's commander-in-chief, was greeted enthusiastically by the people. Another group of people gathered outside the British Embassy. Hundreds of citizens, waving British, Greek, and Thai flags, chanted and sang to express their fervent support for the government's resolve to resist aggression. Twenty British pilots, released from a detention camp due to Greece's wartime needs, were spotted by the crowd, who placed them on their shoulders and paraded them through the streets. Unofficial sources suggested that Britain should bomb Rome in retaliation for the Italian bombing of Athens, believing it to be the most effective way to aid Greece. Greek citizens of British and American descent of military age should organize an international unit to participate in the war. Furthermore, former "Evzones" officers, considered the best troops in the Greek army but dismissed for participating in the 1935 rebellion, have petitioned the King and Prime Minister to join the army. Prime Minister Metaxas has approved their reinstatement. The entire city of Athens is now engaged in defense preparations. Shopkeepers are covering their windows with glass to prevent air raid damage, and air raid wardens are patrolling in steel helmets, appearing quite valiant. Fully armed troops in khaki uniforms constantly pass through the streets of the capital, heading towards the front lines. (United Press dispatch, 30th)

### Turkey Sympathetic to Greece's Resistance to Aggression; Turkey to Maintain Neutrality if Bulgaria Does Not Join the War

Athens: Greece's efforts to obtain support from the Balkan Peninsula have achieved some success. Responsible sources here report that Turkey is positioning itself to "neutralize" Bulgaria, enabling Greece to concentrate its army against Italy. Athens has reportedly received assurances from Bulgaria that it intends to remain neutral. Should Bulgaria abandon its neutrality under external pressure, Turkey will provide active assistance to Greece. At the same time, it is widely believed that Turkey is prepared to provide Greece with any material assistance within its power. Press reports also indicate that the Yugoslav people fully support Greece, further reinforcing the Greek belief in their ability to resist the war. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Istanbul: Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu, in a meeting with Turkish journalists, declared that Turkey will maintain a neutral stance regarding the Italian-Greek dispute. He affirmed that Turkey needs peace and security. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 30th)

Ankara: Following a telephone conversation between the Greek Prime Minister and the Turkish President, the Turkish cabinet convened on the 28th. The results of the meeting have not yet been announced. According to well-informed sources in Ankara, no firm decisions have been made at present. The Turkish government will adopt a wait-and-see policy. While Turkish newspapers took a reserved approach towards the Italian-Greek war yesterday, most expressed sympathy towards Greece. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 30th)

### Soviet Authorities Maintain Silence; Diplomatic Envoys Active in Moscow

Moscow: Yesterday, Soviet officials remained silent regarding the Italian-Greek war. Soviet newspapers offered no commentary on the matter, simply publishing reports from Rome, Athens, and London. (Haitong dispatch, 30th) ○Moscow: Yesterday, the rapid movements of cars in the foreign quarter of the city indicated intense diplomatic activity concerning the developments in the Balkans. Greek Minister Theophilatopoulos visited British Ambassador Sir Stafford Cripps. It is also reported that the Greek Ambassador met with German Ambassador Count von der Schulenburg. Soviet newspapers report the course of events in the Italian-Greek conflict without offering comment. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Moscow: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinsky met with the Greek Minister to the Soviet Union, Theophilatopoulos, last night. The content of their discussions was not disclosed, but it is believed that the Italian-Greek dispute was the main topic. (Haitong dispatch, 30th)

Moscow: Spokesmen for both the Soviet and Turkish embassies today firmly denied rumors circulating here last night that the Soviet Union had provided Turkey with military guarantees, only to be effective in the event of a German attack on Turkey. British authorities also indicated that the rumors contradicted reliable information. A year ago, the Soviet Union and Turkey discussed forging a military alliance, but the negotiations completely failed because the Moscow government insisted that the alliance must be effective against Germany. Well-informed diplomats here believe that the Soviet Union's future policy will tend towards avoiding any commitment that could provoke war with Germany. (United Press dispatch, 30th)

### Japan Unwilling to Be Drawn into the European War; Disregards Assistance Obligations Despite the Tripartite Pact

Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, when meeting with reporters today, addressed the Italian-Greek war, stating that the overall situation remained unclear. Japan does not wish to take immediate action. The Japanese government is currently only observing the actual developments of the Italian-Greek hostilities. When asked whether the Tripartite Pact stipulates mutual assistance among the signatories, the spokesman did not answer, instead repeatedly stating that Japan is watching the situation. When further questioned regarding the reports that Italy did not consult its allies before commencing hostilities, the spokesman said, "Many things are currently underway and cannot all be disclosed to the public." He added that the Japanese government considers a formal declaration of its opinion unnecessary and therefore does not wish to issue a statement. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Tokyo: Today's *Miyako Shimbun* declares that, geographically speaking, Japan has no need to assist Italy in its war against Greece. It is stated that while Japan is obligated to assist Italy under the Tripartite Pact, Japan's assistance to Italy seems unnecessary, given the geographical relationship between Japan and Greece. (United Press dispatch, 30th)

London: A Reuters correspondent states that the slow pace of the Italian advance into Greece has raised doubts in some quarters as to whether the real purpose of Italian actions is to test Japan's commitment to its obligations under the Tripartite Pact. Japan had agreed to provide full assistance should any signatory be at war with a country that was not already at war. Greece has now been attacked by Italy, so this condition is now in effect. However, there is credible reason to believe that the pact contains certain secret clauses that explicitly define "countries not already at war" as referring only to certain designated major powers. In any case, it is likely that Japan would not act automatically on behalf of the Axis powers even under the most favorable circumstances. Japan has surely reserved the right to interpret the terms in its own interest, and is unlikely to be drawn into belligerent status by an attack on a small European nation. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### Spain Does Not Plan to Participate in the War

Madrid: It is the view of well-informed sources here that Franco's well-known desire to keep Spain out of the war is unlikely to be disappointed. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### France and the Axis Powers in Contract Negotiations; French Military Bases for Use by Germany and Italy; Vichy Government Firmly Denies It

Washington: The French Embassy in the United States yesterday issued a statement declaring that rumors of the French government negotiating a peace treaty with Germany and Italy, or ceding French territory to Germany and Italy, are completely unfounded. Claims that the Axis powers will use French military bases, or that France will relinquish part of its sovereignty in mainland France or French territories, are also groundless. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Dublin: The French Legation here states that the French Minister has been instructed to deny reports that important French or French colonial bases have been placed under the control of Italy or Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

London: According to information received by Reuters from Stockholm and Zurich, Switzerland, the French fleet may be made available to the Axis powers. Reuters has received two important dispatches from Sweden and Switzerland regarding the Hitler-Laval talks. Although the sources are different, the reports largely agree, seemingly confirming the veracity of the conditions presented by Germany to France. The dispatch from Stockholm states that, according to reliable sources, Hitler presented Laval with the following conditions during the talks: (1) France will cede Alsace and Lorraine to Germany; (2) The Axis powers will use the air and naval bases in the unoccupied zone of France until the end of the war; (3) France will transfer its fleet to the Axis powers for their use; (4) France will cede Vietnam to Japan; (5) France will cede most of French Morocco to Spain; (6) Italy will receive Tunisia and a large part of Algeria, as well as other coastal lands; (7) French colonies will be placed under the joint control of Germany, Italy, and France, with this system to be reviewed when the war ends. Meanwhile, the dispatch from Zurich also states that, according to reliable sources, Hitler has presented France with the following conditions: (1) Morocco will be ceded to Spain; (2) Vietnam will be ceded to Japan; (3) Italy will take Tunisia and part of Algeria, as well as part of the Maritime Alps; (4) Germany takes Alsace-Lorraine and the area from Switzerland to the North Sea; (5) French air and naval bases will be made available to the Axis powers until the end of the war; (6) French colonies will be placed under joint control until the end of the war, at which point the control arrangements will be determined. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Zurich: According to observers here, Hitler urged Mussolini to curb Italian desires for French territory at their meeting in Florence. As a result, a Franco-German agreement was reached. Italy originally wanted to seize French Corsica, Savoy, and Tunisia. However, under the new agreement, France may retain Corsica and Savoy, and possibly even Nice. As for Tunisia, nothing has been heard. Italy may not have abandoned its original desire for Tunisia. It is widely believed that Italy may have proposed conditions to be met by taking claims in Greece. Other German concessions to France reportedly include: (1) France retaining Lorraine, but not Alsace; (2) The Vichy government returning to Paris; and (3) The border between the occupied and unoccupied zones moving north. In return, France will undertake economic and political cooperation under German leadership to establish a new European order aimed at defeating Britain. As for military cooperation, France may offer its naval bases along the Mediterranean coast and in French North Africa to the Axis powers. It is widely believed that the French colonial army will not fight against Britain unless attacked by British forces. However, French naval involvement in the war remains a possibility. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Rome: As Italian forces continue their advance into Greece, reliable sources tell reporters that Head of State Hitler and Premier Mussolini have reached a consensus on the terms of a separate peace with France. It is also stated that the two leaders reached a final decision at their important meeting in Florence on Monday and intend to hold another direct Franco-German and Franco-Italian meeting before taking the final steps and signing the separate peace. Considering the Italian offensive against Greece, informed sources here believe that Italy will revise its demands on France and instead seek to seize a large part of the French fleet to be able to confront the British fleet in the Mediterranean. Political circles here believe that French Vice-Premier Laval will soon arrive in Italy to sign "a most important document." This document will include modifications to the armistice terms, allowing Italy to use French warships and naval and air bases. (International News Service dispatch, 30th)

### Ambassador Kennedy Broadcasts Speech Endorsing Roosevelt's Re-election; Urges Rapid Rearmament

New York: Joseph P. Kennedy, the current U.S. Ambassador to Britain, broadcast a speech today in New York, vigorously endorsing President Roosevelt's re-election. He insisted that merely relying on the ocean as a barrier against reactionary forces threatening civilization is insufficient. If the United States can rapidly rearm, it can avoid being drawn into the war. From a British perspective, the most unfortunate step would be American participation, as all raw materials would inevitably remain in the United States and the strength of assistance to Britain would be greatly limited. He also denied that the United States has any secret commitments to Britain that could place the United States at war, as what Britain seeks from the United States is not manpower, but machinery. He concluded by urging voters to support President Roosevelt, an experienced leader, and reject his untested opponent. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

The spokesperson also said that Mr. Metaxas's hope that the three armies will give their all, reviving the achievements of 1921, will certainly not be in vain. (Reuters, 30th)

Turkish Army Minister Ali Rıza Artunkal also declared to the press that the Turkish army would defend the homeland, honor, and rights of the Turkish nation when needed. The special express train from Istanbul to the southern capital on Monday was unable to pass through Greek territory due to Greece's refusal, but yesterday's train was allowed to pass.

Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau drew the second ballot, and Attorney General Jackson drew the third. The remaining ballots were drawn by other officials.

(Haitong, 30th)

New York: The American conscription lottery began yesterday. President Roosevelt personally drew the number of the first New York area resident to be conscripted from a historically significant fishbowl. This first conscript was a Chinese American youth named Yuan Changzhang. When the youth learned that his name had been recorded in history, as reporters gathered at his doorstep, he was greatly surprised. He then answered the reporters simply, "I will certainly go."

### Major Fire at U.S. Department of War: Rumors of Sabotage; Military Secrets Nearly Burned

Washington: An outbuilding of the Department of War, where several coded telegrams were stored, caught fire accidentally on Tuesday. The building is currently guarded by troops, as some sources are saying the fire was caused by saboteurs. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Washington: A major fire broke out at the U.S. Department of War at 10:00 AM today, endangering military secrets and important codes. The majority of the Department of War's offices, including the Secretary of War's office, were threatened. The fire originated in an outbuilding of the War Department building, in which were located the offices of Secretary of War Stimson and most of the staff. Three rooms in the outbuilding and countless documents and files were destroyed. For a time after the fire broke out, it appeared that the entire War Department building would be consumed, and extremely important military secrets and codes would be burned. However, the fire was brought under control by the strenuous efforts of the fire brigades and all available fire-extinguishing equipment, and these important secrets and codes, as well as other important items, were preserved. Chief of Staff Marshall arrived thirty minutes after the fire broke out and said that the cause of the fire should be immediately investigated. It is widely believed that the fire originated near the code room, but the code room itself was not damaged.

The firefighters used all their strength to control the fire. At 4:50 PM, Chief of Staff Marshall arrived and ordered 500 soldiers to assist in the firefighting efforts. (United Press, 30th)

### The French Concession Courts Remain Quiet and Stable: Trials Proceed as Usual, No Anomalies; All External Rumors Are Untrue

Rumors that the High Court and the Second Special Court within the French Concession had been taken over have been investigated from multiple sources and found to be untrue. Yesterday, all civil and criminal divisions of both courts continued to hear cases as usual, with no changes. The so-called takeover news reportedly originated in a Western newspaper report, the details of which seemed quite sensational at first glance. However, according to those close to the courts, facts speak louder than words. Everything at the courts is proceeding as usual, and the normal acceptance of lawsuits is a visible fact. Those who lightly believe baseless rumors and think that an irresistible force is coming are simply too nervous.

French Consul General Expresses Cooperation

According to reliable sources, the newly appointed French Consul General Magre has paid a visit to Yang Peng, President of the High Court, after arriving in Shanghai. While this was a courtesy visit that diplomatic officials make at the beginning of their tenure, it is said that Mr. Magre expressed that the Vichy government and the Chinese government have very close ties, and the French side will continue to sincerely cooperate with legitimate Chinese institutions within the French Concession. In light of this, the rumors that there is already a rift between the French Concession authorities and the courts are self-defeating and do not need to be refuted further.

Court Authorities Deny Everything

A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited the High Court on Avenue Petain yesterday afternoon to inquire about the supposed takeover of the courts. The authorities solemnly denied this news, stating that these rumors likely originated about a week ago, when the new Japanese Consul General Kunei Kanshiro made an informal request to the French Concession authorities' legal advisor, Du Ge, to hand over the two courts in the French Concession. Du did not agree at the time but only said that he would relay this request to the new French Consul General Magre, who was about to arrive in Shanghai. When Consul General Magre arrived in Shanghai, he rejected this request and stated that the status quo must be maintained. Three or four days later, French Ambassador to China Cosme sent a telegram from Chongqing to the new Consul General Magre, stating that the issue of the courts must be absolutely maintained in its current state. However, outsiders did not understand the truth, and rumors spread. The truth is that nothing like that has happened. Furthermore, officials from the First Special Court stated that the reports in foreign newspapers were completely false. The reporter then inspected the court and the Second Special District Court for a week and found that both courts were operating as usual, with armored guard vehicles dispatched by the police to provide strict protection, and no other unusual circumstances were present.

### All Circles Prepare to Celebrate the Birthday of the Founding Father: Deadline for Donations for Winter Clothing Extended to the End of November

The anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father, on November 12th is approaching. Due to the special circumstances in Shanghai, various circles in Shanghai, in addition to various schools holding simple commemorative gatherings to elaborate on the Founding Father's revolutionary achievements, will not host any extravagant commemorative ceremonies. However, various agencies, public organizations, and schools will still take a holiday as usual to express their celebration. In order to emulate the Founding Father's revolutionary spirit, support national policies, and accelerate the completion of the great task of resistance and reconstruction, all circles, in addition to unanimously emphasizing spiritual encouragement and working hard in their respective positions, will also take advantage of the anniversary of the founding of the National Patriotic Construction Savings Movement Committee to intensify the promotion of the savings movement to promote national construction. In addition, the collection of 500,000 yuan for winter clothing in Shanghai, which began in August, has been very successful due to the enthusiastic participation of all circles. According to the regulations of the National Fundraising Association, the original deadline was today. However, due to the special circumstances in Shanghai and in order to achieve the goal of double presentation, the relevant parties have decided to extend the deadline for fundraising for winter clothing by one month, to November 30th. All circles, motivated by patriotic fervor, have decided to continue to donate enthusiastically.

### After the Outbreak of the Italian-Greek War, the Greek Consul States: The Whole Country Is United to Resist Aggression; We Will Certainly Be Able to Maintain the Glory of Athens

A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited the Greek Consulate General at 9 Bund in the French Concession yesterday to inquire about the situation of the Italian-Greek war. According to Consul General Yu Ne Lates, he had only received a brief communiqué from his country stating that Italian troops had invaded his country, and he had nothing else to report. Although Mr. Yu's attitude was extremely silent, he was very optimistic about the war. He firmly believed that his countrymen would be united to resist foreign aggression in order to maintain the "glory of Athens." Since the outbreak of the Italian-Greek war, Greeks and concerned parties in this port have flocked to the Consulate General to inquire about news, causing what was usually a quiet and peaceful place to suddenly appear more tense and busy.

### Zhou Zhenyan and Others in Pudong Lead Their Troops in Revolt: Since There Is Absolutely No Room for Survival by Compromise, Restoring the Han Territory Should Not Be the Responsibility of Others

The various units of the so-called "Peacebuilding National Salvation Army" stationed in Pudong have recently been deployed by the Japanese to the front lines in Western Zhejiang to fight. It was stated that they would return to defense in ten days, but unexpectedly, a month has passed, and there has been no news, and there has been a second batch of deployment orders. The general "Peace Army" has suddenly shown signs of wavering. Furthermore, given that all of the weapons of the Qi Yu Yan unit have been confiscated and the Xu Hongfa unit is under surveillance, it is felt that the situation is precarious and unbearable. Therefore, they have revolted one after another. On the evening of the 25th of this month, Zhou Zhenting, the company commander of the Special Service Company of the Sixth Regiment of the "Peacebuilding National Salvation Army," Wang Yongquan, the company commander of the Seventh Company, Jin Fangchu, the company commander of the Eighth Company, Su Jinwen, the company commander of the Ninth Company, and Yang Jingyun, the company commander of the Tenth Company, led their five or six hundred men in a complete revolt. They have already established contact with the Central Government and have begun guerrilla warfare. It is said that the cadres of this unit are all sound and enthusiastic patriots, so they took the lead in launching the revolt. The telegram of revolt from Zhou Zhenting and others has been obtained and is transcribed below (titles abbreviated): Your Excellency, We, Zhenting and others, previously endured humiliation for a time because of the difficult circumstances and precarious situation, but we never ceased to encourage our subordinates and bide our time. Now, the Japanese forces are stretched thin and sinking deeper and deeper. They are deploying thousands of troops from Pudong to fight in Western Zhejiang, driving Chinese people to kill each other. Anyone with a conscience cannot bear to do this. We, Zhenting and others, are heartbroken by what we have witnessed and know that there is absolutely no room for survival by compromise, and we will forever be sinners to the nation and the race. Therefore, we have personally led our troops in revolt and are now under the leadership of personnel sent by the Central Government, who have promised us a chance to start anew. We hope that all the armies accepted into the organization will be able to rise up and return together to restore the Han territory. May the task not be the responsibility of others. We send this telegram from afar, full of emotion. Zhou Zhenting, Wang Yongquan, Jin Fangchu, Su Jinwen, Yang Jingyun, and their subordinates respectfully send this message west.

### Estonian Consulate Documents Transferred to Soviet Representatives: Ministry of Justice Directs Courts to Comply

Since Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union as a member state in September of this year, all Estonian rights and interests in China are protected by the Soviet Union. Previously, personnel sent by the Soviet Embassy in Japan came to Shanghai to collect the Estonian Consulate's files but were unsuccessful. A petition was then filed with the court to seize them, which was carried out by the court on the 18th of this month, as reported in this newspaper on several occasions. According to reliable sources, the Ministry of Justice of the National Government recently sent a telegram to the Second High Court, ordering it to hand over all documents of the Estonian Consulate to Soviet representatives for collection. Upon receiving the order, the court has notified the First Special Court to comply.

### Important Statement from the French Embassy: Denies Rumors of French-German Negotiations

Shanghai (Havas): The French Embassy in China issued a statement here today stating: "Regarding the news carried in local newspapers about negotiations being conducted between France and Germany, its nature is invariably manipulative. This embassy wishes to reiterate the formal denial issued by responsible French authorities. All rumors concerning (1) the preliminary conclusion of peace between France and Germany, (2) the transfer of French territory, (3) the lending of French military bases to Germany or Italy, or (4) the exploitation of sovereignty in any part of mainland France or its territories are purely fabrications and have no basis."

### American Evacuation Transports Pre-booked Berths: Nearly 4,000 People; U.S. Government Does Not Subsidize Travel Expenses; American Organizations Plan Remediation

Regarding the evacuation of American expatriates in China, the American government has already sent four ships east. The "President McKinley" and "Mariposa" have scheduled itineraries, arriving in Shanghai on the 2nd and 10th of next month respectively, as previously reported. Now, a third ship, the "Washington," has also been confirmed to arrive on the 17th of next month to transport American evacuees and depart for Manila on the 21st, arriving on the 23rd. It will depart directly from Manila to Los Angeles on the 25th, arriving around December 8th. As for

Although the price of tickets has been reduced, it is still not affordable for all American expatriates in China, as most American expatriates are employed in China and their salaries are calculated in legal tender, while tickets are sold in US dollars. The exchange rate between Chinese and American currencies differs greatly, so it is still necessary to reduce them further. The employment problem faced by American expatriates upon returning to the United States is also one of the difficulties, as they will have to seek new employment once they leave China. The above two points are difficulties in the evacuation, and although the American side in this port has appealed to Washington, requesting consideration of remedial measures, it is heard that the U.S. State Department has announced that the government does not have sufficient funds to subsidize. Although the American side feels slightly troubled, nearly 4,000 American expatriates in this port have applied to reserve berths, and there is no impact from the State Department's notice, as they have already found ways to purchase tickets. According to the authorities of the American President Lines, responding to the State Department's advice,

About 4,000 American expatriates are preparing to evacuate and return to the United States, and the situation has not changed due to Washington's announcement. However, the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Association of this port are considering this matter. The biggest difficulty lies in the exchange rate, as the income of the salaried class of American expatriates in this port is calculated in legal tender, while travel expenses to return to the United States require US dollars. The difference between the legal tender they have and the US dollars converted is quite large.

### Chinese and Foreign Police of the Public Concession to Be Inspected Tomorrow: At the Drill Hall of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps

The Chinese and foreign police of the Public Concession will hold their annual inspection at 2:15 PM tomorrow at the Drill Hall of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps on Fuzhou Road. This year's inspection ceremony is of an informal nature, so members of the public will not be admitted except for Municipal Council members and journalists.

### The Shanghai-Vietnam Shipping Route Remains Important; Additional Vessels are Deployed; Ships Have Been Temporarily Chartered

Despite the opening of the Burma Road and the diminishing importance of Vietnam to mainland China, the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping route remains significant due to Vietnam's rice and coal exports, which need to be sold in Shanghai, and Shanghai's manufactured goods, which Vietnam requires.

French Merchants Increase Shipments; Sailing Between Shanghai and Vietnam

Since the Japanese army landed in Haiphong, British merchant ships have abandoned the Shanghai-Vietnam route upon orders from the Ministry of the Navy. British ships from this port have been rerouted to Hong Kong, Roro, Singapore and other locations. French merchant ships have seized this opportunity, with French vessels sailing to Vietnam, including the already operating Kim Dinh and Rose. In addition to these, the French Postal Shipping Company has temporarily chartered ships to meet demand, sailing between Shanghai, Haiphong, and Saigon. Today, the freighter Song Thai has arrived in Shanghai, and the company's manager, Bengmingke, will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Both ships will sail from Vietnam to Shanghai, carrying tribute rice and Zhenzhu rice. After unloading, they will continue to sail to Vietnam. When the Shanghai-Haiphong route reopened last month, British merchant ships made two voyages per week. Currently, French merchant ships make a total of only five voyages per week, so there may be an increase in the future.

Dat De Nan Wheel; Sailing New Routes

The French Postal Shipping Company's Dat De Nan Wheel has been out of service in Saigon for a long time. The company has opened new routes in the Far East, as has been repeatedly recorded in the local newspaper. It is now known that the ship departed from Saigon, passed through Little Luzon, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, docking at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. There were also seventy or eighty passengers. The ship will depart from Shanghai for Kobe on the 4th of next month and return to Shanghai on the 11th or 12th of the month. After a one-day layover, it will go to Little Luzon and return to Saigon. Subsequently, the ship will depart from Saigon for Little Luzon, from Little Luzon to Shanghai to Japan, from Japan to Shanghai, from Shanghai to Little Luzon and return to Saigon, without calling at Hong Kong either way.

Hoping for Group Rice Purchases; To be Organized Automatically

It is learned that around the beginning of next month, about 150,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon will arrive in Shanghai. The transaction price of the rice is said to be 79 yuan per bag. At the same time, various rice merchants have taken advantage of the relaxed foreign exchange rate and the low price of foreign rice to entrust foreign firms to negotiate the transaction of a large quantity of tribute rice. Zhu Zixiang, the standing committee member of the Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee, suggested to the committee yesterday that the source of foreign rice in the future is not without problems. At the same time, the price of rice in domestic rice-producing areas is different, and transportation is difficult. It seems that there is little certainty of transporting a large quantity of rice to Shanghai. Although there are rumors that the ban may be lifted, it is hoped that all sectors of society will actively participate in group rice purchases, or automatically initiate group rice purchases, so as not to rely on rice shops for the daily rice supply. The principle of evaluating foreign rice is to give a 5% legitimate profit. Although it has been approved by the authorities of the two concessions, the Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting the day before yesterday to negotiate at length. Everyone believed that the current market price of foreign rice in the rice market is about 5 yuan lower than the production price. If the principle of evaluating foreign rice is implemented on time, the market price will increase by more than 5 yuan per dan. Not only will it not be possible to lower the rice price, but it will also increase the market price, which is not a good policy in the end. Therefore, this principle will be implemented when the market price of foreign rice is high, so as to have some restrictions. The effect will be greater at that time. Therefore, the committee has started to investigate the production price of foreign rice and will immediately send a letter to the authorities of the two concessions for record. At the same time, it will be published in the newspapers so that all sectors of society will know about it. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, it continued to fall. It is said that this is purely due to the abundance of sources and the weakness of people's hearts.

### Church of Our Savior Holds All Saints' Day Evening Worship

The Shanghai Church of Our Savior will hold its first All Saints' Day worship service at the new church on Zhao Zhujiao Road at 7:30 p.m. on November 1st, dedicated to commemorating the saints and believers who have passed away. The worship service that evening will be very solemn, dignified and unique, with special memorial texts. It is a rare ritual in the entire church at sea. Dr. Zhu Baoyuan, the pastor of the district, will give a speech, and more than 60 members of the male and female liturgical societies will assist with the latest anthems. Those who wish to see this worship service are welcome to visit the church at that time.

### Shaoxing Agencies Return; Telegraph Service to be Restored Soon; Japanese Retreating Towards Keqiao Leaving Piles of Corpses; Zhejiang Province Collects 10 Million in Air Defense Funds

The Japanese troops who infiltrated the urban area of Shaoxing, after being strongly attacked by the powerful Chinese troops, have broken through and retreated towards the Keqiao and Qianqing area. More than 200 Japanese troops from Zhoushan have been transferred elsewhere, and the Japanese troops in Dinghai are showing signs of retreating.

Recapture of the City

The Japanese troops who fled east from Gaishan Sanjiangkou crossed Keqiao from Lizhe on the 25th and infiltrated the suburbs of Shaodian City, causing fierce battles. The fierce battle lasted until the afternoon of the 26th, when a small group of more than 100 Japanese troops infiltrated the urban area and a street battle broke out. The garrison troops immediately moved to favorable terrain and began to besiege the urban area. The newly formed troops also arrived one after another. Starting at dawn on the 28th, the Chinese army launched a thunderous counterattack, repeatedly charging and killing. First, Donghu was recovered, and the attack continued towards Wuyunmen. The Japanese were exhausted and set fire to the south of the city to cover their retreat. The Chinese army bravely rushed into the city. The Japanese still stubbornly resisted in the streets. The fierce battle lasted until 4 p.m. The Japanese were unable to support themselves and broke through the Xiguo Gate in a group, retreating towards the Keqiao and Qianqing area. The Chinese army immediately recovered all the strongholds in the city and searched for the remaining Japanese, and sent teams to follow and pursue them to the west. The Japanese army was extremely embarrassed, abandoning military supplies and many corpses along the way.

Agencies Return

The Shaoxing Commissioner's Office, the County Government, the County Party Headquarters, the Police Bureau, and other agencies have returned to the city to work since the 29th. However, the city has been looted, and more than half of the houses have been burned down. Many refugees have been displaced and have no homes to return to, and urgently need relief and rehabilitation. The telegraph between Shanghai and Shaoxing has not been restored, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with the American News Agency. This is because the telegraph equipment in the urban area of Shaoxing was removed from the urban area and has not been reinstalled. It can be restored in one or two days. When the people of Zhejiang in Shanghai heard this good news, they were all delighted and encouraged.

Air Defense Fund

The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that Japanese aircraft have been rampant everywhere recently, and the people feel increasingly threatened. This is because defensive equipment and firefighting equipment, such as anti-aircraft guns and fire trucks, are not fully available for purchase. It has been found that the 20 million people in Zhejiang can raise a fund of 10 million yuan by donating 50 cents per person (those who cannot afford to pay will be paid by those who can afford to pay). This fund can be used to enrich air defense equipment, which can not only passively reduce losses, but also actively strike back. A detailed plan has been drafted. The Provincial Government believes that the air defense funds collected by various counties at present, such as protection equipment fees, membership fees, fines for violating air defense laws, and rent collected over the years, are not uniform in name, and there is no special person to manage them. It is difficult to audit and disburse. It has been decided to organize an Air Defense Fund Management Committee, which is directly subordinate to the Provincial Basic Protection Committee. All kinds of funds related to protection shall be managed and disbursed by the committee.

### Savings for National Construction; Expand the Publicity Week; Scheduled for One Week Starting November 10th; Savings Target Already Reached Three-Quarters

The National Government sent a telegram to its subordinates, stating that the National Savings for National Construction Movement Committee has telegraphed that, in order to actively promote the savings movement, it plans to launch a nationwide expansion of the publicity week from November 10th to 16th. Please inform your subordinates to assist earnestly, etc. In addition to sending a telegram separately, this telegram is sent to you specially, hoping that you will assist earnestly and closely cooperate with the local Savings for National Construction Sub-Committee to facilitate the progress.

Subscription Amount

The Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau have stipulated the outline of promoting the business of savings for national construction. The total amount of savings for national construction to be increased by various banks and bureaus in the 29th year is set at 200 million yuan, which is divided into 150 million yuan for the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Central Trust Bureau, and 50 million yuan for the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The predetermined amount must be reached before the end of this year. It is specially approved to exempt the income tax on savings interest for national construction to encourage people to actively save. Yesterday, it was learned from the banking sector that the savings for national construction have already received more than 150 million yuan. Therefore, it is expected that the predetermined amount of 200 million yuan will be exceeded this year. Savings sub-committees have also been established in various overseas regions.

### A Visitor from Vietnam Talks; Japanese Army Cannot Invade Yunnan; Local French Oppose Humiliating Agreement; Japan Has Economic Ambitions in Vietnam

After the government completely succumbed to Japan's demands, although French people in Vietnam are still governed by French people, and the French tricolor flag is still flying high, the streets are full of Japanese soldiers, and Japanese military aircraft are also soaring in the sky. Japan is now stationing troops in the Jing District of Vietnam and has taken over three airports to consolidate its position. At the same time, it is trying its best to win over the local people. More than half of the Japanese soldiers stationed in Haiphong and the airports are Japanese.

Despondent About Capitulation

French people in Vietnam are quite despondent about the humiliating agreement signed between the Vichy government and Japan, and they hold a pessimistic attitude of inevitable defeat. The hope of external assistance has already been abandoned. The battle of Lang Son was caused by internal strife between the French and Japanese sides. The agreement was signed at 3 p.m. on the 23rd of March, but at 10 p.m., a Japanese army suddenly acted on its own and attacked Lang Son, causing a battle that lasted three days. However, the orders issued by the French side were contradictory, resulting in increased resistance in only a few locations. Later, the Japanese army landed in Haiphong without encountering resistance.

Dissatisfied with the Status Quo; Sympathetic to the Resistance

Many French people in Vietnam are sympathetic to General Trigo Lan, who continues the resistance war, and are very dissatisfied with the current situation. However, their position does not allow them to unite to oppose the Vichy policy of the French authorities in Vietnam. There are fewer than 40,000 French and foreign residents in Vietnam, while the total population reaches 2 to 300 million. The natives are not concerned about the political situation.

Japan Hopes to Seize Resources

Japan also has economic ambitions in Vietnam and has sent an economic mission, which is expected to negotiate major wars with Vietnam. The demands made by Thailand were originally quite harsh, but they have now been revised. They hope to obtain the land they want without using force. It is expected that there will not be a serious war between Vietnam and Thailand.

Chinese Troops Cut Off Roads to Consolidate Border Defenses

As far as China is concerned, it has cut off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and blown it up to consolidate border defenses. However, the Vietnamese army has no intention of invading, and only sends aircraft from its base in northern Vietnam to wreak havoc in China. Due to the terrain, it is very difficult for the Japanese army to invade China from Vietnam.

### Rice, Coal, and Firewood Dealers Raise Prices; French Authorities Impose Fines

On October 30th, representatives from the Price Evaluation Committee, the Police Department, and the Health Department jointly inspected several rice shops, firewood shops, and coal shops in the French Concession. All merchants whose prices did not meet the price limits stipulated by the committee were fined.

### Damp Weather Leads to Flu Outbreak; Dense Fog This Morning

After the cold snap, the weather in this port has gradually warmed up. This morning, there was a thin mist. The fog in the Huangpu River was dense, and ferries and transports were driving slowly with their lights on to avoid accidents. It did not dissipate until noon. However, due to the influence of the low pressure passing through Shanghai, the sky was overcast and rainy throughout the day, and the weather was very bad. The minimum temperature has risen to 54.3 degrees, and the weather is exceptionally humid, leading to a flu outbreak. There are still about 30 corpses found on the streets every day.

### Case of Xu Shuliang's Kidnapping; Two Masterminds Arrested; To Be Tried Together with the Remaining Bandits

Xu Shuliang, the owner of the Shanghai Woolen Mill on Father Lao Road and a native of Ningbo, whose home is located at No. 77 Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai, was suddenly kidnapped by several armed bandits at the door of his residence on the 18th of this month, who sent a letter demanding 200,000 yuan. Subsequently, Hua detectives Tang Jian, Yao Yuanlong, detectives Ni Jia Yan, and Zhu Chiqing of the Jing'an Police Station arrested five bandits including Li Ruitang at the Nanjing Hotel on Huagen Road, and rescued the hostage at No. 18 Fahua Town, along with Li Guangtai, who was watching the hostage. They were all taken to the First Special Court for interrogation and custody. During the investigation, detectives found that the case was actually conceived by Xu Chuanshi, a native of Ningbo who had previously worked in Xu's factory, in collusion with Yang Xiande, an employee of the Jinlong Woolen Mill at No. 24, Lane 207, Qipu Road. Xu and Yang were arrested and sent to the First Special Court yesterday morning, requesting to be detained and tried together in the case.

### Two Million Dollar Embezzlement Case; Still Under Investigation; Japanese Military Court to Investigate; Municipal Council Denies Such a Suggestion

According to well-informed sources, regarding the embezzlement of copper ingots worth two million yuan in the warehouse of the American Ruifeng Transport Company, the Japanese authorities suggested that the case be handed over to the Japanese military court to resolve the issue of privilege. It is said that Nelson, the legal advisor of Jardine Matheson, testified in court. It is heard that the Japanese military headquarters intends to submit documents to "prove" that the copper ingots are not owned by Jardine Matheson. However, senior officials of the Municipal Council denied yesterday that the Japanese side had made this suggestion to the Municipal Council and the Police Department. They pointed out that the Shanghai Municipal Police can only attend courts that are recognized as legal. Therefore, if the Police Department is to attend this court, the Municipal Council must consider this principle. At the same time, Swiss Consul Fontanel told reporters that he would never revoke Hurt's arrest warrant. According to Western detectives of the Police Department, Peng Te, an accomplice, is still under investigation. The First Special Court is scheduled to hear the case for the second time on November 7.

### Puyi Cemetery; Economic Burial Plots Established

The ordinary cemetery was established by the Shanghai Pushan Villa many years ago. It has long been praised by Shanghai residents for its low fees. However, it was once suspended due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War. It has now been tidied up. In view of the fact that the colonies in Shanghai are temporary, and the cost of finding land for burial is very high, in order to adapt to the economic capabilities of general burial households, economic burial plots have been added, with A and B types of fees. Type A is 80 yuan, and Type B is 40 yuan, including the base, transportation costs, ash and soil burial costs. The procedures are simple and the handling is perfect. The cemetery is located on Zhen Da Road and Nan Da Road in Da Chang. The office is located in Pushan Villa on No. 6 Ma Road.

### Female Shanghai Opera Singer; Appeals Theft Charge; Yang Binghua Abandons Her; Ding Wan'e Dissatisfied with the Sentence

Ding Wan'e, a female Shanghai opera singer (36 years old this year, living at No. 21 Xinshou'an Lane, Mintiniyin Road), has been living with Yang Binghua, a native of Hangzhou (37 years old, nicknamed "Little Yang"), since she divorced her husband Ding Shaolan. It has been eight years, and the relationship between the two parties is still harmonious. Unexpectedly, in the spring of this year, Ding discovered that her lover had another lover outside, which caused jealousy. Since then, there have been disputes in the family. Subsequently, the two parties published a notice in the newspaper to sever their cohabitation relationship. Recently, Yang accused Ding Wan'e of stealing his privately placed mahogany bed, dressing table, five-drawer cabinet, and wardrobe, under the pretext of entrusting the mahogany shop to repair them, and hiding them at No. 21 Lafayette Road. He repeatedly pursued Ding, who firmly denied it. Yang hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Ding of theft. The first instance sentenced Ding Wan'e to 40 days of detention for theft, suspended for two years. After Ding was sentenced, she immediately declared her dissatisfaction in court. The plaintiff also believed that the sentence was too light to serve as a punishment. Therefore, both parties appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court at the same time. The case was heard yesterday by Presiding Judge Wu and Assessors Gu and Wu in a joint court. First, the defendant Ding Wan'e and her lawyer Jin Yu appeared in court and stated that the plaintiff Yang Binghua came from a background of cases and relied entirely on the defendant to maintain his life. The mahogany furniture was originally owned by herself, so there was no theft. Please approve the revocation of the original judgment and declare her not guilty. The plaintiff Yang Binghua also hired a lawyer to appear in court. The court reviewed the testimony and announced the end of the debate, scheduling another verdict on the 31st of this month.

### Goods Stored in Vietnam Return to Shanghai; Suddenly Stopped by Japanese Troops; Vietnamese Authorities Originally Approved Shipment; First Batch of Goods Forced to be Unloaded

Since the fall of Guangzhou, Haiphong, Vietnam has become the main hub connecting inland China. Therefore, the shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong has suddenly flourished. However, due to the lack of vehicles to transport goods from Haiphong to the mainland, the goods piled up in Haiphong like mountains, no less than 20,000 tons. Unexpectedly, this summer, the Japanese army instigated the Vietnamese authorities to block the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway transportation, and the Japanese army landed in Haiphong, causing the transportation from Vietnam to the mainland to be interrupted. The goods stored in Haiphong could not be transported, and merchants suffered huge losses. Recently, it was planned to transport the goods stored in Vietnam back to Hong Kong and Shanghai in an attempt to reduce losses. Representatives were sent to Vietnam to negotiate, and approval was obtained from the Vietnamese authorities. Therefore, it was planned to start the shipment immediately. The first batch was said to be loaded on the Norwegian ship Essl, managed by the Zhongtong Shipping Company, to Lianhu. Unexpectedly, it was obstructed by the Japanese army stationed in Vietnam, and the goods that had been loaded on the ship were unloaded again. Merchants were extremely disappointed when they heard the news, believing that the Japanese army stationed in Vietnam was interfering in commercial transport, which was illegal. They are now continuing to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities.

### Young Girl Shen Xuezhen; Almost Tricked Into Being Sold; Four Criminals Arrested Pending Investigation

Shen Xuezhen, a 17-year-old girl from Beiping who lives in East Fahua Town, was recently lured out of her home by Wan woman Zhang Xue, in collusion with her husband Zhang Qifa, and friends Dai Jinsheng from Zhenjiang and Zhang Baosheng from Changzhou. They planned to sell Shen to Qingdao to work as a prostitute. The case occurred on October 20, when Chinese and Western detectives from the Huisi Police Station arrested Zhang Xue and her husband Zhang Qifa, as well as Dai Zhang, at the Shanghai Ning Guild Hall on Kenenghai Road and No. 54 Lloyd Road. Together with Shen, they were all sent to the First Special District Court. Shen was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng opened the Third Criminal Court for review. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them for the crime of abducting young girls for sale and profit, requesting strict investigation. According to Shen, the defendant Zhang Xue told me that a yarn factory in Caogao Town is recruiting female workers, who can get excellent wages. I was tricked by her. Unexpectedly, these people are not good people. They want to sell me to Qingdao and force me to work as a dancer. I don't want to. I quarreled with Zhang Xue at the Shanghai Ning Guild Hall, and police detectives came to rescue me. When questioned, the four defendants gave evasive answers. The court ordered them to be returned to custody separately, pending sentencing. Shen was led back by her mother, Shen Jin.

### South China Middle School Teacher; Extorts Money by Submitting Articles; Sentence Approved for Probation

Luo Jiahua, a teacher at South China Middle School on Nanjing Road from Wuxi, and Xue Hequn, an accountant at Lihe Foreign Firm at No. 670 Sichuan Road from Suzhou, learned that Zhang Guoquan (home address No. 490 Lane 26 Lianyi Road, French Concession), the host of the Poor Children's Relief Association in Room 519 of the Puxi Building on Aiduya Road, used the name of the charity organization to solicit donations on various telegrams and broadcasts. The huge amount of donations received, only three-tenths of it was recorded in the account, and seven-tenths of it was embezzled and used to purchase private cars and prostitutes. Xue and Luo wrote an article about philanthropists and art, which was published in the local newspapers. Then, they cut and pasted the published article and sent it to Zhang Guoquan, asking him to set a date to subsidize the road expenses of 1,000 yuan for working in the mainland. After receiving the letter, Zhang had no choice but to invite Xue and Luo to wait for payment at the Meihua Wine Shop in Xieqiao Lane. Unexpectedly, the Chengdu Road Police Station learned about it and sent detectives to the Meihua Wine Shop to arrest Xue and Luo. They were prosecuted in the First Special Court for the crime of intimidation. The trial has been concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing sentenced Xue Hequn and Luo Jiahua to eight months of imprisonment each for jointly intimidating others to hand over property, with a three-year probation. The seized criminal evidence was confiscated.

### Stolen Car Discovered; Driver and Passerby Bound; Escape After Untying Themselves

At 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Meihua Automobile Company's car (No. 17820) that was stolen by bandits was discovered near Danyang Road on Qitepu Road, Hongkou at 3 p.m. yesterday. A car from another automobile company passed by the area and recognized that the car belonged to Meihua. The company was notified by telephone, and the company reported to the police station and went to retrieve it. When the driver of the car, Zhang Baosheng, was driven off the car by the bandits, he was dragged to Hongzhen by two bandits, who tied Zhang Baosheng to a pole with a rope. When he was being tied up, a passerby passed by the area. Fearing that he would report them, the bandits dragged him to the electric pole and tied him to the electric pole with a rope, regardless of the situation. The two bandits then fled. After the sea person managed to untie himself, he went to the police station to report the case.

### College Student Begins and Abandons, Kneels and Apologizes, Assaults Mother-in-Law and Sister-in-Law, Sentenced to Fine, Divorce Lawsuit Parties Attempt Reconciliation

Zhao Juzhang, a local resident of 287 Binlang Road in the Public Concession, 22 years old, a student at Guanghua University, allegedly fell in love last year with a female classmate, Wang Weizhen (also 22 years old this year, from Wuxi, 583 Xinbei Shansilu). Before it developed, they had a physical relationship. After several intimate encounters, Wang became pregnant. Wang's parents discovered the pregnancy and she

was repeatedly rebuked. Until January 17th of this year, Wang obtained her parents' consent and formally married Zhao Juzhang. After the marriage, the couple's feelings were still good, but the parents-in-law often used unbearable words to insult Wang, saying that Wang was pregnant before marriage, which was clearly improper. On February 22nd of the lunar calendar, Wang went to her maternal grandmother's house for entertainment. Late at night when she returned home, her parents-in-law refused to let her into the room. Wang, feeling expelled, returned to her mother's house. On the 27th, Zhao Juzhang rushed to Wang's house, claiming that he had also been

driven out by his parents and had nowhere to live. Wang discussed it with her parents, and they opened a room in her parents' home for them to live together. On the second day of the seventh lunar month, Zhao quarreled with his mother-in-law and kicked Wang out. That night, they stayed in a business hotel, and the room fee was paid by Wang pawning her watch. At that time, Wang was heavily pregnant, but Zhao suddenly ignored Wang's life. Wang left her mother's house for several days and went to the Sino-German Hospital to give birth, producing a child. Zhao did not pay for medical expenses, so Wang had no choice but to ask her parents to pay the medical expenses and take the mother and son

back to recuperate. After Wang brought the baby, the crystallization of their love, to her mother's house, Zhao still treated his wife as a stranger. Unexpectedly, on August 4th, Zhao quarreled with Wang because his request for over ten yuan in tuition was not granted. Wang's mother and sister, Weihua, came out to mediate, but Zhao actually invited his brother, Zhao Jianhong, and injured both his mother-in-law and sister-in-law, resulting in him being prosecuted in the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhao Xingzhong were both sentenced to fines. Therefore, Wang, feeling that Zhao no longer had marital affection, recently hired lawyer Lin Tong to file a petition with the Civil Division of the First Special Court

seeking a divorce. Zhao, on the other hand, requested cohabitation and declared on the phone that if Wang insisted on a divorce, he would not agree unless he received 20,000 yuan. Regarding the divorce lawsuit, the court, according to the petition, summoned Zhao Juzhang to the Civil Division One court presided over by Judge Tao yesterday. The defendant, Zhao Juzhang, did not arrive, and the plaintiff, Wang Weizhen, also did not arrive, but their attorney, Zheng, arrived and stated that after the case occurred, the defendant had been accompanied by relatives and friends to the plaintiff's home a few days ago, lit candles, knelt and kowtowed to the plaintiff's mother to apologize. This case may be reconciled, and he requested an extension. The court approved the request.

Weather Report

A few places will be cloudy, with strong, turning gentle, northwest to northeast winds. Localized fog.

### Thousand Cup Charity Basketball, To Be Held This Sunday Afternoon, Fang Li Battles Paramount, Battles Shanghai Stars, Tickets Will Be Pre-Sold Starting Tomorrow

The charity basketball competition initiated by the Daqian Boxing Club to commemorate its second anniversary has been progressing very smoothly since it started preparations. It has been decided to hold it at the former site of the Daqian World on Notre Dame Road this Sunday (3rd) afternoon. The Paramount, the Shanghai champion of the All-Shanghai League, and the newly emerging strong team, the Shanghai Star Team, have been invited to participate in the main battle. Since accepting the invitation, they have been working hard and preparing for the battle. The Shanghai Star Team has also telegraphed Cai Jingxiong, a national player far away in the south, to come to Shanghai to help. Mr. Cai has left Yunnan at the beginning of the month, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai within one or two days. At that time, he may be able to catch up and participate in the battle. As for Paramount, there are also arrangements to strengthen the excitement of the competition. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Difficult Teachers College, in order to change the labor, has set a banquet for the players of both sides at the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Sima Road at 7:00 tonight. However, the opposing team participating in the women's performance still needs to be decided tonight, so it has been decided to hold another strict banquet on the night of the grand meeting to comfort them. At that time, the sports news media will be invited to participate again to celebrate together. As for the tickets, in addition to the provision that ordinary tickets are uniformly priced at five yuan per ticket, which has been enthusiastically promoted by the backbone members of the Daqian Boxing Club to all parties, there are also ten special honorary seats, each priced at one hundred yuan, for the competition of major philanthropists. It is scheduled to start selling tomorrow, and the sales location will be disclosed in major newspapers tomorrow. However, the number of ordinary tickets is tentatively set at one thousand, and the current sales have exceeded the number of checkpoints. The number of tickets available for public sale tomorrow will inevitably be small, and those who want to buy must be quick to preempt the opportunity.

The committee members are Gu Songling, Li Xiangxu, Li Shansheng, Liu Weilun, Shen Lantian, Xun Li, Pan Hongding, Cheng Zhiliang and other nine people, and Yuan Ludeng is invited to serve as the chairman of the conference.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Spot Market Unchanged

The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices showed no fluctuations. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates fluctuated, but the appetite of outside banks did not weaken. Although speculators continued to sell, they seemed to accept all comers. The morning started with a slightly firm tone, with the US dollar reaching 6.09375 yuan. However, at noon, news suddenly spread of the opening of the "New Central Bank." Although this statement was not credible, the market was already in a daze. Moreover, Sassoon and others were buying strongly at the same time, so the price returned to par. Futures were tight and more prominent. As a result, at closing, the British gold was still 3 shillings, 9.0625 pence, the US dollar was 6.03125 yuan, the US dollar futures were slightly softer at 0.03125 yuan, and the British gold was unchanged.

US Dollar Futures Slightly Tighter

After opening, speculators continued to sell, and the market was slightly loose. It is estimated that outside banks, such as Yuli and China Eastern Asia, were buying US dollars for this month at a price of 6.0615 to 0.09375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices did not move. The announcement of the silver balance tax also showed no increase or decrease. After this, China's appetite remained good. It is estimated that the outside banks were buying US dollars for this month at 6.60625 yuan, while speculators were selling US dollars for next month to outside banks at 6.0625 yuan. After 11:00 AM, news suddenly spread of the opening of the so-called "New Central Bank." Although it was not small, people's hearts were slightly weakened. In addition, Sassoon and others were buying fiercely, and the outside banks were all scraping, and the market returned to par. Futures were slightly softened. It is estimated that Sassoon entered the outside banks with US dollars for this month at 6.0225 and 0.0325 yuan, and the Japanese banks Mitsui also entered the same month with US dollars at 6.03125 yuan. The closing price for British gold for both spot and futures was 3 shillings, 9.0625 pence, and the US dollar spot was 6.03125 yuan. Next month was quoted at 6.00 yuan.

### Gold Market Wants to Fall But Stops

Yesterday, the cooked gold market's view was that because the US dollar turned from loose to tight, the market first fell and then rose. The 5,500 yuan mark was decisively broken and then pulled back. The morning opened low at 5,495 yuan. It was difficult to sell and close at 6.9375 yuan for this month's US dollar, and the selling momentum was even more surging. Securities firms sold as low as 5,450 yuan, and there was more favorable air. Moreover, with the US dollar being absorbed by various Chinese and foreign banks and Sassoon, it softened to 6 yuan, and the market was agitated. Silver and gold shops were adding to their long positions, and the price rose to 5,550 yuan. The market closed at 5,535 yuan, continuing to rise by 15 yuan. The half-day transaction totaled about 3,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. It was reported that the spot price was still more than 20 yuan higher than the futures price, and the prices of jewelry gold and customs gold were both flat.

Half-Day Fluctuation of 100 Yuan

The morning started with the exchange market reporting a rise, and buyers were not forthcoming. Silver shops first sold 10 taels to gold shops, opening at 5,495 yuan, which was already 25 yuan less than the previous day. Continuing, silver shops and securities firms dumped and fell to 5,450 yuan, but the foreign exchange turned stable, and people's hearts returned to high. Gold shops and other large households competed to buy, and the price immediately returned to a straight line. It is estimated that silver shops did 20 taels, at 5,530 yuan. Afterwards, it slightly fell by tens of yuan. It is estimated that silver shops sold 20 taels to gold shops, at 5,480 yuan. Suddenly, buyers surged, and they were allowed to force the gold and silver shops to go long. Before long, the gold and silver shops entered the silver shops with 20 taels, rising to a high price of 5,550 yuan. As a result, the silver shops did another 10 taels, closing at 5,535 yuan, which was 15 yuan higher than the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. There was a fluctuation of 100 yuan in half a day. The current price of gold at the cash shop is more than ten yuan higher than the cooked red price, and the purchase price is thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold is lower than the listed gold by fifty-six yuan, and there are few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Has Not Moved From Beginning to End

The exchange price per tael of silver building jewelry gold has not changed from beginning to end. It is estimated that the Tai Tong Hang still hangs at 570 yuan, and the new counterpart is similar to the above price, with a purchase price of about 30 lower.

### Foreign Currency Market Outlook Is Good

Yesterday's foreign currency market, only the cooked red market price first fell and then rose, British and American gold pounds rose slightly by 5 jiao, British gold notes were still rarely traded, and the market price was flat. US gold notes had initially fallen to 15 yuan, 6 jiao, and 8 fen, but later, due to rumors that "a certain bank" would soon be established, the public's demand was strong, and the market price gradually rose, and the evening market was as high as 15 yuan, 9 jiao, and 1 fen, which was 1 jiao and 1 fen higher than the previous day. Hong Kong notes rebounded by 4 fen, Japanese gold notes are still in demand, and the market price continued to rise, and the evening market was as high as 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 9 fen, which was 3 fen higher than the previous day. Korean notes were evenly supplied and demanded, and the market price was flat, and the evening market was still 1 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 fen.

### Silver Standard Committee Acts as Agent for Exchange of Checks Payable in Central China

The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House Committee yesterday sent a circular to all clearing banks stating that, starting November 1, 1940, the committee would act as an agent for the exchange of checks payable at the Central China Commercial Savings Bank, and the assigned agency number is (50 Wei), it was said.

### Securities: Good News Arrives, Domestic Bonds See Renewed Buying Interest, Foreign Stocks Also Show Good Potential

The over-the-counter market for unified government bonds yesterday saw a sudden calming of the downward trend. This was due to favorable domestic news and frequent reports of victories. The outflow of spot goods from a certain major player decreased, and bullish forces gradually emerged. Buying interest was revived, and the market sentiment slowly improved as short covering occurred one after another. It is evident that although the supply and demand of various bonds on the surface were mixed, prices ultimately rebounded. At the opening this morning, the trend was firm with a hint of flatness because Hongda, Chengkang, and retail investors were dumping shares. Afterwards, the supply became scarce, and many buyers were interested, so Lemao, Shunchang, Tongkang, and others aggressively pushed up prices. The market price turned firm and rose by about half a yuan. Grade C bonds reappeared above 59 yuan. The afternoon saw a slight stabilization of fluctuations, and trading was also quieter. Sellers included Hongda, Tongshun, Chengkang, and Jiufu who successively sold off, while Shunchang, Tongkang, Maotai, and Lianyi were buying in. As a result of the day's price fluctuations, Grade D bonds, except for a small decrease of 5 jiao because there was no trading on the previous day, all rebounded by 3.5 to 7 jiao. The transaction volume was over 1.5 million yuan.

Stock transactions included 22 shares of National Debt Bank, priced at 58.5 yuan.

Yesterday, the stock market for various industries saw little transaction volume but good potential. Jardine Matheson rose after the previous day's correction and once showed signs of hitting a new high, but it was stopped by short sellers and those taking profits. Other stocks, such as British American Tobacco, Jardine, and Jardine Brewery, were very stable. Ziang Tai Timber Company's shares rose to 42 yuan at the closing. Rubber stocks were quiet.

London, November 29 (Tuesday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British companies' stocks remain flat. The market has not changed.

### Wheelock and Others Pay Dividends

British firm Zung Foong and Co., Ltd. is scheduled to distribute an interim dividend of 2.5 yuan per share of common stock for the year 1940 on November 12.

British firm Wheelock and Co., Ltd. is scheduled to distribute an interim dividend of 5 yuan per share for the year ending March 1940 on December 5. In addition, British firm Maotai Co., Ltd., managed by the same company, is scheduled to distribute an interim dividend of 4 yuan per share for the year 1940 on December 4. Shanghai Tug & Lighter Co., Ltd. is also scheduled to distribute an interim dividend of 40 yuan per share of common stock for the year 1940 on December 4, and a semi-annual dividend for preferred stock at an annual interest rate of 3.5%, equivalent to 1 tael and 7 qian and 5 fen per standard tael.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Price Breaks the 200 Yuan Mark, Falling More Than 30 Yuan in One Day

The yarn market continues to be weak, and the downward trend is gradually emerging. This is because sales to customers are sluggish, and at the same time, there are some rumors that are favorable to short sellers. As a result, the market is weak, and short selling is active. Currently, both the long and short sides of the yarn market have considerable strength. It has been rising for a long time, and perhaps there will be a period of consolidation, which is also unknown. It is found that 1,980 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.

The opening atmosphere of the spot yarn market this morning was still good. 20-count Shuangma brand was 1,232 yuan. Soon it rose to 1,232 yuan. Subsequently, due to the lengthening of foreign exchange and the lack of actual demand, it fell back to 1,220 yuan. However, short selling activities covered the positions, and it rose again to 1,255 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange market was not good, and floating longs came to close out their positions. The market was loose, and the market price fell straight to 1,207 yuan. It is found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 5,930 bales. The market price for 20-count Shuangma fell by 17 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchases is listed separately as follows:

Fellow traders 5,700 (illegible character) Hong Kong 120

Wenzhou 20 Statistics 5,930

In the afternoon, cotton yarn and cloth continued to decline, and the downward trend was particularly strong. It is said that the exchange market fell, so short sellers were very active. 20-count Shuangma initially traded at 1,207 yuan, then broke through the 200 yuan mark to 1,195 yuan, and finally traded at 1,197 yuan. Someone wants to buy in, it is said.

### Batch of Brazilian Cotton Ordered

The current cotton situation is slightly flat and tired. Because the yarn market has fallen back, the atmosphere is slightly relaxed, and a batch of Brazilian cotton has been ordered, so the factory's demand is not strong. The fellow traders' purchases are also stagnant, it is said.

The market price of foreign cotton in New York's cotton market was slightly active (illegible character), and then, due to the firmness of stock prices on Wall Street and the covering of some short positions, the closing price was up two or three pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by one rupee.

The transaction of Shanghai's foreign cotton has been extremely quiet in recent days. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude because of the instability of exchange rates. However, due to the lack of inventory of raw cotton in the market, cotton prices will not fall. The current situation is only a temporary stagnation.

### Miscellaneous Grains: People Like Cream Flavored Five Spice Beans, Broad Beans Have Good Luck, Soybeans Remain Sluggish

Recently, cream-flavored five-spice beans have been quite popular, so the late-season broad beans have unexpectedly had good luck. The market atmosphere is firm and abnormal. In addition, the source is scarce, and the bottom is thin (about only seven or eight thousand bags of large and small green and white broad beans). The sales market has exports, and the local street is searching for them, so they are quite tight. Yesterday, 50 bags of Wujiang selected green broad beans were traded at a price of 26.5 yuan, 300 bags of ordinary goods were traded at 23 yuan, more than 350 bags of Nanxiang green broad beans were traded at 21.1 to 21.8 yuan, 100 plus bags of Chongming green broad beans were traded at 20.065 yuan, 200 bags of sand broad beans were traded at 24 to 24.5 yuan, more than 300 bags of Jiading white broad beans were traded at 24.6 yuan, and 400 bags of small-grain Wuhu white broad beans were traded at 22.3 yuan. Recently, the soybean market has been quite sluggish, sales are not smooth, and the source is continuous, so the declining trend still exists. Yesterday, only 240 bags of Tianjin beans were traded at 40 to 39.5 yuan, and 50 bags of Qingdao beans were traded at 34.5 yuan.

### Food: 8,000 Tons of Rice Arrive, Corn Accounts for Over 5,000 Tons, General Rice Prices Are Still Stable

Yesterday, a large batch of foreign rice was directly shipped from Saigon on the French vessel "Dada De Nam," as was previously announced in the newspaper. It is now learned that the ship arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, carrying 8,000 tons of foreign rice, including 5,067 tons of corn (i.e., pearl rice) and 2,324 tons of foreign rice, which were unloaded at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. It is also learned that the French company's cargo ship "Songtai" may also arrive today, bringing a large amount of foreign rice and corn from Saigon, totaling 9,000 tons. The exact amount of rice will be reported after the ship arrives. (From "Zu")

The supply of foreign rice has recently arrived in a continuous stream, and the inventory in the city has gradually increased. However, the sales, except for a slight embellishment by the local shops, have long been halted by the customer stockpiles. Even speculative floating buyers have stopped because there is no profit to be made in the declining market prices. The market is taking a natural trend and gradually declining. Foreign orders for the No. 2 Saigon shipment are only 71 yuan. However, due to the recent shortage of ship space, 500 tons negotiated by Duoyang Bank yesterday may have to be postponed. British American Tobacco's re-boxed goods were still being shouted at 71 yuan in the morning, but because the fixed price was low, 150 tons were sold off at 70.05 yuan. High-level stores took advantage of the low price in the early market decline, so the final decline was only 4 or 5 jiao. The transaction volume was 7 or 8 thousand bags.

More than 1,500 piculs of new japonica rice, sharp rice, and kiln-seed wild rice have arrived. Among them, there are only 60 or 70 piculs of kiln-seed rice. The goods were scarce and fragrant for a time, and the price was increased by 5 jiao to 1 yuan in an instant. However, the supply and demand of new japonica and wild rice are similar, and only a stable situation is presented. The same is true for Du Sheep sharp rice. The opening prices were 75 yuan and 74.5 yuan for Qingjiao kiln-seed rice, 71.5 yuan to 70 yuan for Kunshan new japonica rice, 77 yuan to 73 yuan for original bags, 79 yuan to 77 yuan for Sijing wild rice, 66.5 yuan to 64 yuan per picul for Du sharp rice, 71 yuan for factory special, 66 yuan for Sheep sharp rice, and there was no change in broken rice. Changbang high-quality broken rice was sold for 85 yuan, and South Port early broken rice was sold for 78 yuan per original bag and 77 yuan to 70 yuan per picul. The route for glutinous rice wholesale is still sluggish, and there is a lot of foreign glutinous rice in the market. The owners all have the intention of selling off, so the domestic glutinous rice is fatigued and falls by 5 or 6 jiao to 1 yuan. Kaiyi Liyang white rice opened at 75 yuan, Changdan at 74.5 yuan to 73 yuan, and Hong Kong special rice fell from 72 yuan to 68 yuan.

### Flour Mill Supply Increases

Yesterday, the flour market did not escape the sluggish situation. Since the factory supply has increased recently, the local demand is quite abundant, and even ordinary foreign flour is being sold in the market, so the market has made little progress. The returned goods from the Old Military Barracks are only 18.78 yuan, and there is only a little activity in the local street. The people's hearts are also weak because foreign flour is expected to arrive soon, and the market, except for the Huachang factory selling 8 or 9 thousand bags in batches, has very little other trading. The market is still watching for softening.

Wheat: Yesterday's market remained unchanged. The supply from inland China has been scarce for a long time, and the foreign supply is also quiet. In the recent fatigue of the flour market, it is difficult for the market to recover. The purchase prices of the factories are mostly limited to the original level, and there are few suppliers. Except for a few sporadic deliveries of nearby wheat to Japanese factories, there are no other formal transactions.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Futures Trading Accounts for Only a Small Number... Mostly Spot Payment

Yesterday, the factory cloth market was stable. In recent trades among the businesses, the majority are paid spot. Because only small amounts are future trades, when the month ends, there is little turbulence. The coarse cloths, colored cloths, and bleached cloths are mostly not sold in bulk. For smaller purchases of cloth, each piece will only be offered at discount of 2.5 jiao. The Zhejiang gang had more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill fabric. The Kuagang gang had more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth. The North Road Yantai gang had more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and twill flannelette. The local street had more than 400 pieces total. The Nanyang gang had more than 5,000 piece of colored and bleached fabric. On the 31st, 380 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

The East cloth was caused by the exchange prices of yarn decreasing, and so the floating buyers were eager to sell. The best Longtou brands are 7.5 jiao cheaper, up to 36 yuan and 4.5 jiao. The closing prices for middle cloths and middle twills are only down 4 to 5 jiao. The actual demand in this market has not decreased. Fellow traders are still buying while it is cheap. Trading is still robust. The closing price for Sijunzi broadcloth is 1 yuan 1.35 jiao per yard.

### Coal: Dalian Coal Takes Advantage

The market for fuel-wood and coal has been nearly completely stagnant since the Wenzhou coal supply was exhausted. Although rumors say the Dasheng vessel has entered the Ou River to seal the wrinkles, because this is the first voyage the fuel and rough good are hard to transport. But yesterday a foreign company was selling a Dalian grass-packed coal in the city for the price of 14 Japanese gold (converted to 21.01 legal tender), because the cost is high, trading is rare.

### Silk and Tea: China Tea Begins Buying Tea

Since the management of red and green teas in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces was transferred to China Tea Company, it is said that the red and green teas in Tunxi have begun to be purchased since the 15th of this month.

General tea merchants are said to be satisfied with this. On the 31st, 342 pieces of tea leaves were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Unfinished Masterpiece

— Shui Rong

"Why, did you just walk past so quietly? Won't you flip through this? Won't you write something with us?

"'The Unfinished Masterpiece' - what a great epic it is! Full of continuous, fiery struggles: man against nature, man against man! Struggles between good and evil, light and darkness, justice and power!

'Strife of flesh and blood! Joy of life! Sorrow of death!

'Our ancestors tirelessly created it. But there were also those who tried to destroy it, namely some pages praising violence and eulogizing dictators.

'But we have ultimately progressed from barbarism to civilization!

'Just flip through it! Just imagine: this "Unfinished Masterpiece" has gone through the creation, arrangement, alteration, and obliteration of how many hands! How much effort of how many people has been consumed!

'Now is the time for us to create and arrange it. We have ready-made, excellent themes: "Struggles between groups! Group struggles against nature!"

'Some people, some groups, want to alter and obliterate it. Attack them! Overthrow them! This era no longer tolerates praise of violence and eulogies of dictators!

'If bloodshed is needed, let it flow, let it flow, to enrich and perfect this "Unfinished Masterpiece."

"Why, are you afraid? Please flip through it. Or write something with us. This is not just about 'leaving your name'!"

'We must strive to make it better before handing it over to our descendants, just as our ancestors handed it to us.'"

Family

### Remembering My Eldest Brother

— Liu Yun

When my mind is blurred, the shadow of my eldest brother often appears before my eyes, still as haggard and humorous as before. The loud singing of "Graduation Song," which my eldest brother loved to sing, also spreads in my ears. This is because the impression my eldest brother gave me was too deep, so the shadow of my eldest brother is always engraved in my memory, never to be erased.

Brave, promising, and dear eldest brother, he actually broke the joy of family reunion, painfully left the person he most respected and was devoted to - our mother, separated from his most beloved younger brother and sister, and threw himself into the embrace of the motherland! This was something that happened on a dim moonlight night on September 3, 1939. To this day, I have not received good news from him from afar. I don't know where he is wandering now.

In my hometown, one early summer morning, the blood-red sun slowly rose from the eastern mountain, and everything on the earth showed vitality. The fish swam freely on the clear water surface. My eldest brother's thin hand rested on my shoulder. I carried two novels, took a bag of biscuits, and walked closely with my eldest brother. My second sister took three fishing rods, sang "Fisherman's Song," and followed behind us. We walked to the pond behind the house, put down the fishing rods, and sat on the Taihu stones under the shade of the tree. My eldest brother stroked the top of my head with his right hand, held my second sister's hand with his left hand, and said with an encouraging tone: "Second sister, younger brother Yun, your talents are much smarter than mine, and you have not suffered from the huge feudal invasion, because when you became sensible, the feudal ideas of the family had almost been overcome by me, so your thoughts are very pure. I want to help you embark on the right path so that you will become useful people in the future." This happened three years ago. Now, when I occasionally think about it, this scene is as if it were before my eyes.

Indeed, my eldest brother helped us with our academic achievements, introduced us to proper books, led us to live in groups, and participated in concerts and sports meets. At that time, there was not a moment in my heart that was not filled with innocent happiness. A naive smile appeared on my face.

When I parted with my eldest brother, he held my hand very earnestly and said, "I hope you will follow in my footsteps and embark on the bright road." My second sister is very ambitious. She really followed in my eldest brother's footsteps a week ago. All that remains is their lonely and pitiful younger brother - me. I don't know whether my eldest brother is alive or dead. I can't see his gaunt face, so I can only take his photo and cry loudly on the ground!

I don't know what year and month, my eldest brother's right hand will be able to stroke the top of my head again, and his left hand will hold my second sister's hand, sitting on the big Taihu stone under the tree.

The Hawthorne Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 10: The Shoe Problem

Hawthorne said, "What clothes was he wearing?" Old Mao said, "Of course, a suit." I thought to myself that the word "of course" was inevitably a bit suspicious. Zhao Boxiong was wearing Chinese clothing when he was arrested in the morning. However, after he was released, he might have changed into a suit.

I said to Hawthorne, "If it's him, that's even more troublesome. Do you think Chief Cui's guarantee is reliable?"

Hawthorne looked at Li Laotou on the ground and said slowly, "I don't want to rely on his guarantee. I want to catch this guy with my own hands. But the prerequisite is whether he did this thing, which remains to be studied." He pointed his finger at Li Zhiban on the ground. "The bullet is still in his chest, not penetrated - I don't think he will die, maybe he can still talk."

I replied, "If he can talk, that would be great. But that guy surnamed Zhao, in any case, it is necessary to find him. You said you want to catch him yourself, are you confident?"

Hawthorne said, "I didn't have it before, but now it's different."

At this moment, with a burst of "bo-ba, bo-ba" sounds, the police station's ambulance had arrived. Ni Jinshou jumped down from the car. He first looked at Li Zhiban on the ground in panic, and then spoke to Hawthorne. "It's terrible! Another bloody case! What should I do?" "Hawthorne replied: "Don't panic. Now send him to the hospital first, maybe there is still a chance of rescue."

Ni Jinshou waved to several people in white uniforms on the car. Two people carried the stretcher down as before and walked to Li Zhiban's side. In less than three minutes, the car had taken Li Zhiban to the hospital.

Hawthorne first waved to Old Mao to call him into the house, and then said to Jinshou, "According to Old Mao, when he heard the gunshot and ran out, he also saw Zhao Boxiong's back."

Ni Jinshou exclaimed, "What! He did it again? This person has a certain , it's really unbearable."

Hawthorne said, "It's hard to say whether it was him. But we always need to see Mr. Zhao again."

Ni Jinshou looked to the left and right of the street. "Where are Songquan and Hesheng? They should have seen it." (152)

Women

### Participate in Social Activities as Much as Possible

— Ren Wei

We are not extremists who say that women must step into society only after the entire society is liberated, and abandon the possible, partial improvements at present; I believe that even mobilizing one or two women to participate in social activities is an aid to the entire women's liberation movement. Based on this principle, then Mrs. Chen Mingjun, who is "full of organizational skills," should do something for society as much as possible. "It is difficult to start making ropes with chaff," now that the iron gate for women to participate in social activities has been slightly opened, are you still standing still?

So my conclusion is this: young women who have studied in school or not, and are now waiting at home "to be matched," quickly run out of the family and go to society to do what you can do. Intellectual women who have servants at home should also do things outside the home as much as possible. This is not only to train yourselves, but also to open a path for your daughters!

Suppose life is a floating cloud,

I will also condense into raindrops and fall to the earth!

### A Tourist's Account of Hollywood (Part 1)

— Sent by Cheng Zhizheng from Los Angeles

In order to tour the film capital renowned worldwide, the reporter made a special detour to the city of Los Angeles in southwestern America on his way home.

In most people's minds, Hollywood is imagined to be a large, decadent city, but in reality, it is just a small town near Los Angeles. One early autumn morning, after breakfast at the hotel, the reporter excitedly inquired about the route to Hollywood. It turned out that Hollywood was only about ten miles from Los Angeles, and could be reached directly by streetcar or bus. After a twenty-minute bus ride, the reporter saw several lush and beautiful mountain peaks in the distance, with a row of neon letters standing among the sparse trees. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be the large letters of "Hollywoodland."

If we interpret it literally, then Hollywood means "holly forest." It turns out that Hollywood's climate is spring-like all year round, somewhat like Singapore. The mountains are winding, and the trees are lush, making it a place of great scenic beauty. Calling it "holly forest" is perfectly fitting. The road from Los Angeles to Hollywood is lined with coconut trees, swaying in the breeze, adding endless poetic and picturesque charm.

Soon, our car arrived at Hollywood Boulevard, the center of Hollywood. As I strolled along the street, I seemed to feel a strange sensation, sensing that there might be a chance of discovering a few glittering stars in the bustling crowd. So, as I walked, I paid close attention to the endless stream of pedestrians. Although I didn't encounter any stars, I did see many beautiful women, probably starlets in the making.

The prosperity of Hollywood is self-evident. The sparkling jewels in the stores fully demonstrate the characteristics of this film capital! As the reporter walked along Hollywood Street for a while, he suddenly saw a "Chinese Theatre" (Grauman's Chinese). This is the most elaborate cinema in Hollywood, but it is not owned by Chinese people. I didn't inquire in detail why the word "Chinese" was used in the name. The architecture of the cinema is indeed Chinese in style, and the female ticket clerks each wear a set of Chinese-style silk clothing with the "double dragons playing with a pearl" design. The most interesting thing is that the cement in front of the cinema is imprinted with the footprints and handprints of many big stars. Each person signed their name below the prints and wrote a word or two, all to the owner of the theatre. John Barrymore, who has been married four times and is now going through a divorce, not only left his handprints and footprints but also personally imprinted the contours of his face. I took a close look, and some of the stars were no longer alive, and some of the old stars were no longer on the screen. The former included Douglas Fairbanks, and the latter included Gish. Shirley Temple recently retired, and her little hands and feet are particularly worthy of remembrance.

### On Ru Fulan (Part 1)

— Weiwei

Speaking of Northern Wusheng (martial male roles), since Yang Xiaolou and Yu Zhenting passed away one after the other, and Shang Heyu retired due to old age, in today's terms, they can be divided into two generations. The older generation includes Zhou Ruian, Sun Yukun, and Ru Fulan, while the younger generation includes Li Wanchun, Wu Yanheng, Liu Zongyang, Yang Shengchun, Li Shengbin, Gao Shenglin, Wang Jinlu, and Chuan Dewei, among others. If we are to make an absolute judgment in terms of artistry, as it stands now, none of the younger generation can compare to the older generation. As for the three of the older generation, Zhou Ruian's acting is excessive, so he is inferior to Sun and Ru. Comparing Sun and Ru, each has their own strengths, and it is difficult to determine who is better. Recently, Ru Fulan was hired to come to Shanghai, and people both inside and outside the profession have praised him unanimously. His popularity is greater than that of all the Wusheng who have come here in the past, which shows that "it is appreciated by all." Therefore, I will analyze Fulan's art in detail.

Foundation: Ru Fulan is the grandson of Ru Laiqing and the son of Ru Xijiu. Laiqing studied at the Xiao Rongchun opera school and received the true teachings of Yang Rongshou. Rongshou was the foremost Wusheng of the last thirty years. Therefore, Fulan has a rich family heritage, different from the common. Fulan studied at the Fu Liancheng opera school, originally learning Xiaosheng (young male roles), and later changed to Wusheng. While at the school, he was personally taught by Xiao Changhua and Dong Fengnian. As a Xiaosheng, he was proficient in both civilian and military roles. After Cheng Lianxi left, Fulan and Lianxi became the leading Xiaosheng of Fu Liancheng, performing Xiaosheng operas such as "Qi Shuang Hui" (The Amazing Double Meeting), "Qun Ying Hui" (The Gathering of Heroes), and "Zhan Puyang" (The Battle of Puyang). He was already famous at the school. After changing to Wusheng, he started with the two operas "Jin Suo Zhen" (Golden Lock Array) and "Jin Lan Hui" (Golden Orchid Meeting). He then learned Yang (Rongshou)'s masterpieces such as "Tan Zhuang" (Exploring the Village), "Ye Ben" (Night Flight), "Wugong Ling" (Centipede Ridge), as well as "Zhuangyuan Yin" (The Scholar's Seal), "Tiao Hua Che" (Picking the Sliding Cart), and "Qilin Ge" (The Qilin Pavilion), all of which were taught by Laiqing. Therefore, although Fulan came from Fu Liancheng, what he gained from Fu Liancheng were Xiaosheng operas, and his Wusheng operas were all family-taught, which is to say, he indirectly followed the artistic lineage of Yang Rongshou.

Advantages: Today's general up-and-coming Wusheng do not have the same foundation as the older generation.

### A Tourist's Account of Hollywood (Part 1)

— Sent by Cheng Zhizheng from Los Angeles

In order to tour the film capital renowned worldwide, the reporter made a special detour to the city of Los Angeles in southwestern America on his way home.

In most people's minds, Hollywood is imagined to be a large, decadent city, but in reality, it is just a small town near Los Angeles. One early autumn morning, after breakfast at the hotel, the reporter excitedly inquired about the route to Hollywood. It turned out that Hollywood was only about ten miles from Los Angeles, and could be reached directly by streetcar or bus. After a twenty-minute bus ride, the reporter saw several lush and beautiful mountain peaks in the distance, with a row of neon letters standing among the sparse trees. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be the large letters of "Hollywoodland."

If we interpret it literally, then Hollywood means "holly forest." It turns out that Hollywood's climate is spring-like all year round, somewhat like Singapore. The mountains are winding, and the trees are lush, making it a place of great scenic beauty. Calling it "holly forest" is perfectly fitting. The road from Los Angeles to Hollywood is lined with coconut trees, swaying in the breeze, adding endless poetic and picturesque charm.

Soon, our car arrived at Hollywood Boulevard, the center of Hollywood. As I strolled along the street, I seemed to feel a strange sensation, sensing that there might be a chance of discovering a few glittering stars in the bustling crowd. So, as I walked, I paid close attention to the endless stream of pedestrians. Although I didn't encounter any stars, I did see many beautiful women, probably starlets in the making.

The prosperity of Hollywood is self-evident. The sparkling jewels in the stores fully demonstrate the characteristics of this film capital! As the reporter walked along Hollywood Street for a while, he suddenly saw a "Chinese Theatre" (Grauman's Chinese). This is the most elaborate cinema in Hollywood, but it is not owned by Chinese people. I didn't inquire in detail why the word "Chinese" was used in the name. The architecture of the cinema is indeed Chinese in style, and the female ticket clerks each wear a set of Chinese-style silk clothing with the "double dragons playing with a pearl" design. The most interesting thing is that the cement in front of the cinema is imprinted with the footprints and handprints of many big stars. Each person signed their name below the prints and wrote a word or two, all to the owner of the theatre. John Barrymore, who has been married four times and is now going through a divorce, not only left his handprints and footprints but also personally imprinted the contours of his face. I took a close look, and some of the stars were no longer alive, and some of the old stars were no longer on the screen. The former included Douglas Fairbanks, and the latter included Gish. Shirley Temple recently retired, and her little hands and feet are particularly worthy of remembrance.

### On Ru Fulan (Part 1)

— Weiwei

Speaking of Northern Wusheng (martial male roles), since Yang Xiaolou and Yu Zhenting passed away one after the other, and Shang Heyu retired due to old age, in today's terms, they can be divided into two generations. The older generation includes Zhou Ruian, Sun Yukun, and Ru Fulan, while the younger generation includes Li Wanchun, Wu Yanheng, Liu Zongyang, Yang Shengchun, Li Shengbin, Gao Shenglin, Wang Jinlu, and Chuan Dewei, among others. If we are to make an absolute judgment in terms of artistry, as it stands now, none of the younger generation can compare to the older generation. As for the three of the older generation, Zhou Ruian's acting is excessive, so he is inferior to Sun and Ru. Comparing Sun and Ru, each has their own strengths, and it is difficult to determine who is better. Recently, Ru Fulan was hired to come to Shanghai, and people both inside and outside the profession have praised him unanimously. His popularity is greater than that of all the Wusheng who have come here in the past, which shows that "it is appreciated by all." Therefore, I will analyze Fulan's art in detail.

Foundation: Ru Fulan is the grandson of Ru Laiqing and the son of Ru Xijiu. Laiqing studied at the Xiao Rongchun opera school and received the true teachings of Yang Rongshou. Rongshou was the foremost Wusheng of the last thirty years. Therefore, Fulan has a rich family heritage, different from the common. Fulan studied at the Fu Liancheng opera school, originally learning Xiaosheng (young male roles), and later changed to Wusheng. While at the school, he was personally taught by Xiao Changhua and Dong Fengnian. As a Xiaosheng, he was proficient in both civilian and military roles. After Cheng Lianxi left, Fulan and Lianxi became the leading Xiaosheng of Fu Liancheng, performing Xiaosheng operas such as "Qi Shuang Hui" (The Amazing Double Meeting), "Qun Ying Hui" (The Gathering of Heroes), and "Zhan Puyang" (The Battle of Puyang). He was already famous at the school. After changing to Wusheng, he started with the two operas "Jin Suo Zhen" (Golden Lock Array) and "Jin Lan Hui" (Golden Orchid Meeting). He then learned Yang (Rongshou)'s masterpieces such as "Tan Zhuang" (Exploring the Village), "Ye Ben" (Night Flight), "Wugong Ling" (Centipede Ridge), as well as "Zhuangyuan Yin" (The Scholar's Seal), "Tiao Hua Che" (Picking the Sliding Cart), and "Qilin Ge" (The Qilin Pavilion), all of which were taught by Laiqing. Therefore, although Fulan came from Fu Liancheng, what he gained from Fu Liancheng were Xiaosheng operas, and his Wusheng operas were all family-taught, which is to say, he indirectly followed the artistic lineage of Yang Rongshou.

Advantages: Today's general up-and-coming Wusheng do not have the same foundation as the older generation. This is not necessarily because things are getting worse, but the biggest reason is that today's teachers are no match for the old masters of the past. At the same time, also due to the influence of the times, today's opera schools are not as strict as they used to be, and the up-and-coming figures are having difficulty laying a good foundation precisely because they lack strict discipline.

Brief News (1) The Xinle Palace Yue Opera Theatre, located in the New Inn on Er Ma Lu (Second Avenue) and Daxin Street, has perfect internal facilities and comfortable seats. It is scheduled to open tonight, with star performers including Xiao Hehua, Ma Yiqin, Pang Tianhong, and Ye Xiangting, among others. (2) After the premiere of "Qin Huai Shijia" (The Families of Qin Huai River), viewers unanimously praised it. A single-volume edition is now available for fifty cents, and is sold by all newspaper vendors.
