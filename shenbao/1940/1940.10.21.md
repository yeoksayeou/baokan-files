### U.S. Establishes New Naval Policy: Preparing to Deal with Incidents Alone; Maintaining the Status Quo in the Far East with Full Strength; U.S.-Canada Understanding and Cooperation to be Expanded

Washington, D.C. It seems that the United States has made a decision today to achieve naval leadership in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in order to protect the Western Hemisphere and the interests of major powers in the Pacific. The Navy Department is establishing a new naval policy based on the "Two-Ocean Navy Act" passed by Congress and the lease of British air and naval bases in Newfoundland. It is reported that the purpose of this new policy is to maintain sufficient naval strength so that it "can conduct large-scale battles in both oceans simultaneously." Military strategists with access to naval information here believe that this policy is sufficient to deal with the current chaotic new world situation. These experts say that the United States traditionally relied on cooperation with the British Navy to protect its Monroe Doctrine and maintain the "status quo" in the Far East. However, today, Britain's strength has been constrained by the European war and is no longer reliable. Therefore, the United States must prepare to deal with incidents alone. According to their opinion, the policy of the U.S. Army and Navy Department is based on the following three possibilities: (1) Britain may be able to defeat the German attacks and continue to maintain the naval balance of power in the world. If this can become a reality, then the combined naval strength of Britain and the United States will be sufficient to remove the threat of omnipotent countries. (2) If the British Isles are conquered by Germany, the British fleet will inevitably flee to Canada and Australia and cooperate with the U.S. Navy. If so, the U.S. Navy will be the main force in protecting the English-speaking peoples from being conquered by Germany. (3) If the British fleet is seized or destroyed by Germany, the United States must take Britain's place and replace it, striving to build the largest navy and be the "lord of the sea." It is said that, according to the new naval program, the United States has the strength to deal with any naval threat from Japan or from the combined forces of Germany and Italy. Military leaders generally believe that the first or second option is likely to be realized, because they have repeatedly received assurances from British Prime Minister Churchill that the British fleet will never surrender or scuttle itself. However, they admit that, in fact, Britain is constrained by the European war and can no longer take any action in the Far East. Therefore, the United States must shoulder the responsibility of maintaining the "status quo" in the East alone. These military leaders are very clear about Japan's "ambitions in Greater East Asia." Therefore, they believe that if the United States wants to protect the Philippines, which will become independent in 1946, and other U.S. interests in the Pacific, the United States must have a reliable naval guarantee so that it can speak with authority. They also feel that once Japan controls the Dutch East Indies and other parts of the Far East, the position of the Hawaiian Islands will no longer be as important as it is today. The new naval policy states the following principle for U.S. naval policy toward U.S. overseas territories: "Maintain naval strength and be ready at all times to maintain national policy and domestic and foreign interests." The new policy will also be fully developed to establish three major bases, two on the American continent and one in Hawaii. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)

### Pro-German Slogans Found at U.S. Recruitment Office

New York. U.S. Army authorities recently found Axis propaganda slogans at an army recruiting office a few days ago, which they believe to be the work of pranksters. Papers printed with Nazi swastikas were posted all over the walls of the office, and other places were plastered with slogans such as "Heil Hitler," "Long Live the Nazis," and "Long Live the Fascists." Also, many people in New York recently received various types of small coins in the mail, all engraved with swastikas. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)

Washington, D.C. The State Department declined to comment on reports that German Consul in New York, Trangue, was directing Nazi activities in the United States. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)

It will arrive in Shanghai on November 9. It is said that the ship can carry 1,100 passengers. In addition, the "Monterey" will also go to Qinhuangdao to pick up American expatriates there, and then return to the United States via Kobe. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)

The ship carried 135 officers and soldiers of the Second Marine Division to serve in the Panama Canal. This is the first batch of naval reservists to be called up for service. The "Washington" will also transport a large quantity of military supplies in San Pedro to supply the U.S. Army and Navy in the Far East. The person in charge of the "Washington's" speedy voyage to the Far East is shipowner Manning. After adding 2,000 hammocks to the ship, it can evacuate 3,100 American expatriates from the Far East.

What is known is that most of the women and children will go to Shanghai first this month in order to wait for ships to return home. (Havas dispatch from the 19th)

### Britain Intensifies Blockade Against Japan in the Far East; Buys Up All Aircraft Fuel in the Dutch East Indies; Netherlands Denies Agreement with Japan

London. The British government announced today that a new competition for economic footholds in the Far East has begun, and stated that the British Empire has bought up all the aircraft gasoline produced in the East Indies. Just as Japanese bombers are attempting to cut off the Burma Road and Japanese envoys are trying to buy oil in the East Indies, the British side revealed that all high-grade gasoline in the East Indies has now been "branded" and is ready to be shipped to Britain. At the same time, London officials expressed skepticism about the reports in Tokyo newspapers that the Batavia-Japan-Netherlands negotiations had reached a consensus, but stated that the export of low-grade gasoline and oil from the East Indies to Japan would not be prevented. It is generally known that the Japanese had requested the East Indies to sell them 14,000,000 barrels of gasoline and kerosene annually, but the British side stated that it was "very remote" that this request would be agreed to. It is said that London is "closely watching" the Batavia negotiations, but the general impression is that "the United States has more to do with this matter than Britain." From the information obtained here, the general impression is that unless Japan uses force, the blockade of high-grade aircraft gasoline in the East Indies is already in effect. (International News Service dispatch from the 20th)

New York. Washington officials are very interested in Britain's purchase of all aircraft gasoline stocks in the Dutch East Indies. It is emphasized here that this new measure by Britain will have a significant impact on Japan, because since the United States implemented a fuel embargo, it has forced Japan to seek gasoline from "elsewhere." According to reports from Batavia, oil rights negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies are also at an impasse. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 20th)

Washington, D.C. The Dutch delegation here stated yesterday that, to their knowledge, the talks currently being held between Japan and the Dutch East Indies authorities in Batavia are only to find ways to ensure that the Dutch East Indies can continue to supply gasoline to Japan. They denied the rumors that Japan has reached an agreement with the Dutch East Indies, and that 40% of the gasoline needed by Japan in the next six months should be supplied by the Dutch East Indies. (United Press dispatch from the 10th)

### British Cabinet Member Greenwood Warns Japan: Rashly Participating in the War Will Lead to Unfortunate Consequences

London. Greenwood, a cabinet member without portfolio, said in a speech in Wakefield last night that although Britain has scars on its face, its spirit remains unchanged and cannot be subdued. No one can predict at this time who will join the war and who will stay out of it before the war ends. I hope that Japan will not be so foolish as to participate in the war. However, neutral countries now know that Britain cannot be threatened, humiliated, or defeated, as they imagined a few months ago, and they know that Britain is now stronger than it was at the beginning of the war. We can now speak to Japan in a way that we considered dangerous four months ago. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)

### Australian Prime Minister Calls Out: The War Crisis is Approaching

Canberra. Australian Prime Minister Menzies said in a broadcast last night that if anyone believes that the war danger in Australia is not as serious as what Britain is currently experiencing, then that person is currently living in a fool's paradise, and this paradise will turn into a fool's hell in a few days. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)

Melbourne. The Australian Minister for the Army announced that British recruitment matters in Australia will be carried out again early next year. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)

### U.S.-Soviet Talks Progress; Japan Feels Anxious; Kensuke Horiuchi Departs Washington to Return Home; Ishii Says Japan Will Avoid Conflict with U.S.

Tokyo. Asahi Shimbun's comments on the U.S.-Soviet talks reflect Japan's anxiety, stating that the Soviet Union does not seem to fully support the alliance between Japan and the Axis powers. The Japanese people should pay close attention to future developments. The United States is now trying its best to bring the Soviet Union into the Anglo-American bloc. The United States' permission for the Soviet Union to charter ships to transport goods to Vladivostok and allow the export of machinery shows that there has been progress in U.S.-Soviet negotiations. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)

Washington, D.C. Kensuke Horiuchi, the recently recalled Japanese Ambassador to Washington, will return to Tokyo today. He will sail back to Japan from San Francisco. Horiuchi visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday for a brief farewell. According to the Japanese Ambassador, a successor has not yet been decided, but he solemnly stated that the position will definitely be filled and there is no doubt about it. (Taiwan Public News Agency dispatch from the 20th)

San Francisco. Ishii, the new Japanese Ambassador to Chile, said here yesterday that war between the United States and Japan is impossible, because Japan joined the Axis alliance to avoid conflict. Ishii arrived here aboard the Asama Maru to take up his new post. Ishii said that Japan believes that if it joins the Axis powers, a war with the United States will be impossible. Therefore, Japan concluded this public agreement to avoid conflict. He further stated that there are still many ways for U.S.-Japan cooperation to be pursued, and sufficient time to seek and improve all current difficulties. He continued that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka instructed him to make this statement upon arriving in the United States. Ishii declined to discuss rumors that Japan is negotiating a non-aggression pact. (United Press dispatch from the 10th)

### Roman Pope Broadcasts to the U.S., Urging Prayers for Peace

Vatican City. Pope Pius XII broadcast to the American people yesterday on the eve of "Missionary Sunday," urging prayers for peace. The Pope said that "world peace is part of the Church's missionary goals," and denounced the war as hindering the work of the clergy. The Pope said, "Missionaries are heroes of Christ. They suffer and labor, fighting in danger, poverty, and destruction." He hoped that through the prayers of believers, "peace based on equal treatment and order among people and countries will be realized." The Pope also gave his blessing to the Catholics in the United States. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)

Editorial

### The U.S.-Soviet Talks in Progress

In recent days, the Soviet Union's TASS news agency has been authorized by the Soviet authorities to refute rumors almost every day. Upon investigation, half of the sources of these rumors are from democratic countries and Allied countries, and although there are also reports from neutral countries, they each originate from one side of the belligerent countries' positions. This is naturally due to the subtle attitude and complicated situation of the Soviet Union itself, but it also shows that in the recent international competition, the Soviet Union is the most pivotal and has become the main object of contention for both sides of the international power camp. Further investigation of the effect of these bizarre and diverse rumors reveals that they not only fail to influence the Soviet Union's external position, but also, under another consciousness, very likely increase the Soviet Union's restraint and prudence, and increasingly believe that it is wise to remain aloof from all international disputes.

Since the Tripartite Pact, this newspaper has repeatedly made detailed comments on the Soviet Union's attitude. Yesterday, it analyzed the British-German diplomacy towards the Soviet Union and asserted that in the future, the key to the development of the Balkan situation lies in the rise and fall of British-German diplomacy towards the Soviet Union. At the same time, parallel to this competition, there is a race between the U.S. and Japan for negotiations with the Soviet Union. And the safety of the Pacific situation in the future will undoubtedly depend on the future of this negotiation. Although the international division is now much clearer than before, the wars being waged on both sides of Asia and Europe are also trending closer. However, the Allied countries have implied that the pact will not create new constraints, and the Soviet Union may not fail to deal with individual Allied countries differently due to the different relationships between urgency and importance. If the situation in the Balkans and the Black Sea becomes tense again, then, considering the Soviet authorities' consistent view of the western border over the eastern border, it will have a significant impact on the negotiations being conducted by the U.S. and Japan with the Soviet Union at the same time: either temporarily approaching Japan for strategic reasons, so that the醞釀 of a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact gains unexpected success; or the fundamental contradictions will sharpen the confrontation with Japan, so that the international mixed and chaotic situation will not continue; these two trends are diametrically opposed, but today, to calmly discuss their possibilities, each occupies half and half. In recent days, American public opinion seems to have shown impatience and even resentment due to the U.S.-Soviet relationship remaining stagnant and unimproved: from this deduction, of course, changes cannot be foreseen. To say that the Soviet Union will inevitably be pro-Japanese and anti-American is certainly arbitrary and exaggerated; but to say that the situation of a U.S.-Soviet joint containment of Japan will inevitably be realized is also overly optimistic; in short, the future is unknown.

In terms of the recent international situation, the foreign policy of any country must not allow emotional likes and dislikes to be mixed with actual interests without distinguishing them; the one who knows this best and uses it most precisely is Germany, which is obviously beyond the reach of democratic countries. The Nazi Party's basic ambition to oppose communism and oppose the Soviet Union does not hinder its conclusion of a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union; Japanese right-wing politicians and soldiers are now trying their best to follow suit. In democratic countries, however, the anti-communist instincts of the big capitalists often hinder the implementation of beneficial foreign policies, which is the most distressing phenomenon in recent years. As of today, it is necessary to urge them to thoroughly reflect on this. At this moment, the U.S. and Japan towards the Soviet Union are quite similar to the diplomatic competition between Britain, France and Germany towards the Soviet Union before August last year. At that time, the British-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement failed to achieve anything for a long time, while the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact had the appearance of water flowing to a ditch. The Soviet Union once incurred the aversion of international anti-aggression elements because of this, but in all fairness, this was not because the Soviet Union was biased between the two hostile camps of Britain, France and Germany, but because of the essential differences between the two proposals. The mutual assistance agreement is active, and the result is inevitably that obligations will be more than rights; the non-aggression agreement is passive and sufficient to ensure one's own safety for a period of time; if any country only considers its own temporary interests and does not consider others, there is no doubt that the non-aggression agreement is easier to accept than the mutual assistance agreement. At present, in the U.S. and Japanese negotiations with the Soviet Union, the U.S. government does not lack sincerity as the British authorities did at that time, and has given the Soviet Union considerable economic benefits, but what the U.S. demands from the Soviet Union is more advanced than Japan's mere request for mutual non-aggression (if the Japanese side's request goes beyond the scope of mutual non-aggression, it is expected that there will be absolutely no chance of success), then the ease or difficulty of negotiations between the two will inevitably affect the future of this triangular relationship. But this is also not that the Soviet Union's affinity for the U.S. and Japan is contrary to the world's ideas, but precisely the natural result of a "neutral and peaceful policy" and avoiding taking chestnuts out of the fire.

If the Soviet authorities' considerations are in line with the above speculation, then the Soviet Union's subjective "neutral peace" will inevitably lead to the consequences of aggression and disturbance in another area in an objective sense; because this guarantee of "non-aggression" is precisely a signal for those with great desires to reduce their worries and carry out aggression arbitrarily. Therefore, the world's hope that the Soviet authorities will be particularly cautious in handling matters is no different from expecting a certain part of the United States to correct its anti-Soviet instincts.

In our view, the so-called joint problem with Japan should only occupy a part of the U.S.-Soviet negotiations. What should be known is that the more important central task should be the closely coordinated joint aid to China. Because between the Soviet Union and the United States, only on the point of aid to China can absolute consistency be achieved, and the result of aid to China is directly beneficial to oneself on the one hand, and indirectly restrains Japan on the other. Even if the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact is truly established, as long as the Soviet Union does not change its consistent and firm declaration of aid to China, then the actual benefits that this empty paper agreement can give to Japan will ultimately be limited and cannot be compared with the effect of joint Soviet-American aid to China; and the restraining effect that the Soviet Union shares in the Pacific will also be exerted more effectively by China. This is what both sides must have realized in the current U.S.-Soviet talks.

### China Adopts Special Precautions to Maintain the Traffic of the Yunnan-Burma Road; Important Bridges are Equipped with Anti-Aircraft Guns; Road Repair Teams are Ready to Work at Any Time

Chongqing. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has decided to maintain the traffic of the Burma Road at any cost, and has adopted special precautionary measures to eliminate the impact of Japanese air raids. Anti-aircraft guns have been installed, and a large number of road construction materials have been stockpiled at key points. Road repair teams are stationed along the way, ready to work at any time. Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Chiang Ting-fu broadcast yesterday that the Burma Road will always exist. This is not only a physical link among democratic countries, but also a spiritual bond. Chinese military and transportation authorities recently told a Reuters visitor that the Japanese bombing of the Burma Road does not seem to hinder the passage of the road. Emergency construction materials have been prepared along the way, and important bridges are protected by anti-aircraft gun teams. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)

New York. According to radio broadcasts obtained here, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun declared today that Japan has the right to bomb the Burma Road in Burma. According to the broadcast by the Domei News Agency, since Britain has recognized that a state of war exists between China and Japan, its reopening of the Burma Road proves that Britain has made itself Japan's enemy. Therefore, Japan can have the same right to bomb the section of the highway in Burma as it does in China. (Taiwan Public News Agency dispatch from the 10th)

The following is a summary of the combat operations:

Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Border Area: The Japanese troops in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area launched a large-scale offensive this week. The Japanese army invading western Zhejiang advanced along the northern and southern routes of Tianmu Mountain. The Japanese army that invaded Xiaofeng and Anji from Wukang in the north of the mountain was repelled by our forces. The Japanese troops who invaded Guangde from Si'an were also surrounded and severely attacked by our forces, suffering heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese troops retreated towards Langxi in southern Anhui and were intercepted by our forces along the way, resulting in many casualties. The Japanese troops south of the mountain repeatedly attacked Lin'an and Xindeng but were defeated by our forces. The county seat was lost and regained. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and attempted to cross the Fuchun River to attack Zhuji. They were intercepted by our forces midway, suffering significant losses. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. The Japanese troops invading from Jurong and Jintan in southern Jiangsu attempted to join the Japanese forces invading Xiyang in western Zhejiang but were attacked by our forces. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. The important Japanese stronghold of Huangjin Town west of Jintan has been recaptured by our forces, who seized a large amount of spoils of war. The Japanese troops invading Yicheng from southern Anhui once entered the city but were surrounded and severely attacked by our forces, with nearly all of them annihilated. The remaining Japanese troops were defeated and retreated, and there are now no Japanese troops in the area. Another unit of our forces captured Yinjiahui and several nearby high grounds west of Guichi on the 15th, posing a significant threat to Japanese shipping on the Yangtze River.

Hubei-Jiangxi Area: Our forces in Hubei Province have launched continuous attacks in Qianjiang, Mianyang, Jingzhou, Shashi, and areas east of Dangyang and Yichang.

Our forces in northern Jiangxi successively captured Wangjiaguan, Xiao'ao, Shuangsong Bridge, Guantou, and other strongholds along the Ruiwu Road, boosting morale. On the night of the 11th, they recaptured Madang, a key strategic point and the throat of the Yangtze River, effectively cutting off Japanese shipping on the Yangtze River. Subsequently, the Dajiao River and Henggang in the Ruiwu area were also successively recaptured. The Japanese troops who invaded Xin'gan have been repelled by our forces.

Guangdong-Guangxi Area: Our forces in eastern Guangdong continuously attacked Bijia Mountain, an important Japanese stronghold in Chao'an County, completely destroying the Japanese construction works and inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese.

Japanese Lieutenant General Otsuka Takeo, who was severely wounded during our forces' mopping-up operation against the Japanese troops near Taiyuan last month, has died. The Japanese troops in Xinyang Liulin in southern Henan once launched an attack on Zhanqiao. Our forces met them head-on and defeated them one by one. The Japanese troops who invaded western Mianyang in northern Henan have been repeatedly defeated by our forces. Our forces have advanced to the outskirts of Qinyang City and are currently surrounding and fiercely attacking them.

Other Areas: The Japanese troops who branched out from Yishui in southern Shandong to provide reinforcements, the Japanese troops in Xintai and Laiwu who colluded to attack Lucun, and the Japanese troops in Laiwu and Tai'an who colluded to attack Miaoshanji and Chayekou have all been defeated by our forces. On the 13th, our forces also recaptured Yuanhe, Meiguanzhuang Gushan, Shuangyan, and other strongholds northeast of Juxian County. Our forces in Deping, northern Shandong, killed Japanese officer Kiyama during a mopping-up operation, seizing a large amount of military supplies.

Its construction plans are divided into wartime and postwar periods. During wartime, the main focus will be on reclaiming wasteland, cultivating special products, and establishing more factories. The company plans to raise 50 million in overseas Chinese shares. Zheng Yushu and Hu Wenhu also held a meeting in Hong Kong in mid-last month and decided to actively collect share capital. Fujian Chairman Chen Yi hopes that Hu will return to Fujian for a visit to conduct preliminary investigations to facilitate investment by overseas Chinese.

### Shuangpo River Resumes Navigation; Yellow River Breaches in Henan Province Closed

Zhengzhou: After the Yellow River changed its course southward in the summer of 1938, the Shuangpo River in central Henan was affected, becoming silted up and halting navigation. The entire river, from Xinzheng to Fugou, flows into the Jialu River for forty kilometers. The Yellow River Commission, in order to restore navigation, has been renovating it since April of this year. First, the accumulated water in Weimou territory was drained, and the Hongmao ditch and the tail of the Shuangpo River were dredged. Then, hard beaches were excavated and bridges were renovated in counties such as Dunling and Weichuan, and over 4,000 trees obstructing navigation were cut down. The two breaches in Weishi Gaomiao and Weichuan Nanguan have also been blocked. Now that river transportation has resumed, the residents on both banks are delighted. (20th Dispatch)

Zheng County: The new Yellow River flood control embankment was completed last autumn. From Zheng County to Shouji in Anhui Province, it is over 500 li long. Due to the large amount of work and limited funds during construction, the height of the embankment is only about 1.1 meters, and there is no revetment engineering, so the flood control capacity is relatively weak. The most dangerous section is in the Weishi area. During this year's major flood, the Yellow River water rose sharply, with a flow rate of over 10,000 cubic meters per second. The water overflowed the top of the embankment. During the spring, a sub-levee of high width and meters was urgently built to resist the water. However, due to the excessive water force and wind and waves, the sub-levee could not withstand it, and four breaches occurred successively at Shilipu, Shaojiuhuang, Siqian Zhangkou, and Zhang Tie (all in Weishi territory). The Shaojiuhuang opening is 97 meters long, the various Qiankou gates are 734 meters long, and the Siqian Zhangkou opening is 2,605 meters long. Subsequently, after day and night emergency blocking by Yellow River Commission stationed personnel, the Shaojiuhuang and Shilipu two openings have been closed. The Siqian Zhangkou and Zhang Tie two departments can be completed by the end of this month, not only will farming continue uninterrupted, but the river defense will also be further consolidated.

### Residents of Xiangyang and Fancheng Enjoy Increasing Stability; Abundant Autumn Harvest and Low Prices; Various Businesses Flourish

Fancheng: I have worked in the Xiangyang and Fancheng area for over two years and have witnessed all the wartime dynamics of a city. Although it has been repeatedly shaken, it can still stand firm, support the remnant situation in Henan and Hubei, and ensure the southeast gateway of the great northwest. The staunch spirit is admirable. I will briefly describe the past situation and current situation of Xiangyang and Fancheng. For more than a year, Xiangyang and Fancheng have been located on the front line of the war, and have been subjected to fierce bombings by Japanese aircraft from time to time, and property and life have inevitably been slightly damaged. However, the general residents are eager to return to their homeland, and their determination to defend is firm. Under the guidance of the authorities, they work together to resist the war. Houses are repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, and the market becomes more prosperous. Various businesses have never been shaken by the ravages of Japanese aircraft or the presence of Japanese troops. During this summer's war in Henan and Hubei, Xiangyang was briefly entered by Japanese troops on the afternoon of June 1st, but it was recaptured by our forces the next morning. However, tens of thousands of houses inside and outside the city were almost reduced to ashes, with only about 2-3% remaining. Fancheng and Xiangyang are across the river from each other. Since the Japanese army could not occupy it, they first bombed it with aircraft and artillery. Thick smoke rose, and the fire shone for ten miles at once. Although the Chinese soldiers and civilians were a hundred times braver, and did not avoid the rain of bullets, they drove away the Japanese while putting out the fire. Half of the houses in the city were destroyed by artillery fire. As a result, Xiangyang, a city famous in history, became a rubble yard, with broken bricks and broken machinery scattered in the alleys, and sheer walls and ruined walls standing on the streets. More than 100,000 people were displaced and homeless. Later, after being comforted and relieved by the authorities, they first ate and slept in the open air and ran hundreds of businesses in the mounds and alleys, and then, with the assistance of the engineering troops of various units, built new houses and rectified the shops. They received enthusiastic relief from all parties, including: (1) 200,000 yuan from the Central Government, (2) 100,000 yuan from Chiang Kai-shek's wife for the rescue of women and children, (3) 10,000 yuan from the Hubei Provincial Government, and (4) several tens of thousands of yuan from a certain group army stationed there. Life has gradually stabilized. In addition, this autumn is a year of good harvests, and prices are low. Top rice costs five yuan per dou, and the market is very active. All kinds of businesses are showing a thriving trend. The people have suffered this painful lesson and have universally participated in various organizations such as transportation and rescue teams, and are very enthusiastic about national construction savings and winter clothing fundraising. Recently, a certain group army has used 10,000 yuan from the fines for handling private goods to purchase 100 mu of land in the Guangchang Square of Fancheng's Four Officials' Store, and during the slack season, they use military engineering to provide relief and use the abandoned bricks from the city walls to build a park for the military and civilians to enjoy after work. From now on, the scenery on the banks of the Xiangjiang River will be renewed, the military and civilians will be invigorated, and the construction force will be so great that it is a proof of the inevitable victory of the Chinese army.

### Yu Hongqi and Zhang Shanzi Pass Away in Sichuan

Chongqing: Yu Hongqi, Supervisor of the Control Yuan of the National Government, courtesy name Fanting, was a native of Louxia, Shandong. He joined the Tongmenghui at the end of the Qing Dynasty and engaged in revolutionary work. After the founding of the Republic, he served as a member of parliament. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and the Control Yuan was established, he was immediately appointed as a member of the first session, serving until now. He was loyal, honest, and dedicated to his duties. He died of accumulated overwork on the 18th of this month in the Beibei residence, at the age of 64. President Yu and all his friends deeply mourned his passing. Yesterday, Central Committee Member Ding Weifen and Zhang Youlun, a member of President Yu's advisory staff, went to Beibei to pay their respects.

### German and Italian Actions in the Balkans Increase Tension

Hungarian Capital: Tension in the Balkans is increasing daily as news reaching here indicates that over 500,000 troops have been amassed along the Bulgarian-Greek border. A direct telephone line is reportedly in operation between Salonica and Istanbul. It is also said that Soviet-Axis military talks are underway at a port on the Adriatic Sea, though this has not been confirmed. The semi-official newspaper "Slovo" stated today that Turkey "may encounter the same tragedy as Holland and Belgium" and that the Soviet Union is unwilling to aid Turkey. (20th International News Agency Dispatch)

Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini departed last night for Fiume (Finme) on Italy's southern border. There are signs that the Axis powers are eager to consolidate their control over Southeastern Europe, and Mussolini's trip is one of them. Rome Radio stated that the Italian Prime Minister arrived in Forli and explained that "the Premier will inspect troops along the eastern border tomorrow." It is unknown whether Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has also left Rome. News from the Hungarian capital indicates that the Axis powers are threatening Greece and Turkey with military action, demanding that they leave Britain and join the Axis group. The Italian Foreign Ministry's organ, International Relations, stated that all Balkan issues must be resolved immediately. The newspaper also said, "The shadows in the Balkans must be resolutely removed by Italy with the firmest means. Italy's influence in the Balkans must not be curbed, hesitation is unreasonable, and delay is illegal." (10th International News Agency Dispatch)

Rome: Italian Prime Minister's mouthpiece Gayda published an article warning Greece and Turkey against falling into Eden's trap and stating that if Britain interferes in Greece and Turkey, it will be retaliated against. (20th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

Turkey Concentrates Large Army, Determined to Resist Aggression

Istanbul: It was indicated here last night that Turkey is currently planning to mobilize all reserve officers who have not yet reached the expiration of their term, those aged between twenty and forty, who have special proof of having completed university courses, have been ordered to report before the end of this month to complete one year of service. (20th United Press Dispatch)

Rome's "People's Daily" carried an article today stating that Turkish troops are now concentrated along the Çaatalca line, estimated to number between 400,000 and 500,000. It is also reported that the Turkish General Staff has set up a headquarters in Adrianople. The report goes on to say that the Greek capital attaches great importance to the British Minister of War, Eden, visiting Istanbul or the capitals of Turkey and Greece, believing that the strength of the British fleet in the Mediterranean will be enhanced as a result. In short, the attitude of Turkey and Greece is now gradually becoming firmer. (20th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

Cairo: A Reuters correspondent recently traveled 1,300 miles from Istanbul via Syria and Palestine to Cairo and gained two major impressions: one is Turkey's determination to resist foreign aggression, and the other is the treacherous and difficult terrain of Anatolia in winter. Former Turkish President Kemal, knowing that the Turkish army is weaker than the Western powers in terms of mechanized units, has laid out dangerous roads and stopped building some roads that could benefit invading troops. If German troops enter Turkey, they will feel a lack of oil, food, and munitions because the Danube River freezes for many months and cannot transport these essential items. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Berlin Denies Ultimatum to Greece

Athens: Last night, the Greek government denied reports that the Axis powers had issued a three-part ultimatum to the Greek government. Senior government officials here stated that the report was pure mythology and denied rumors that Greek King George had abdicated. (20th United Press Dispatch)

Berlin: Yesterday, responsible authorities here denied rumors spread abroad that the Axis powers were putting pressure on the Balkans to join the Axis bloc. When receiving reporters yesterday, the German spokesman said that Germany had not made a final request to Greece, and the English claims that the relationship between Germany, Greece and Turkey was strained were also completely unfounded. The new Europe must be based on the political system of the Axis powers, which is inevitable, so there is no need for pressure from Berlin. If there are still people in Europe who believe in democracy, they can follow the policies they adopt, but for the newly created Europe, they will miss the opportunity. Regarding this level, there seems to be no need for the German government to formally notify the governments of various countries. The war against England has now progressed to the fourth act, and if ignorant amateur diplomats still believe that it is in the first act, we cannot care. The meeting of English diplomats in Istanbul must be in preparation for retreat, and the Axis powers will undoubtedly be able to take the lead in Southeastern Europe. (20th Huitong Electric)

German Troops Enter Romanian Territory; Soviet Union Protests to Germany

Bucharest: According to unconfirmed reports circulating in Viennese political circles, the Soviet Union has sent two dispatches to Germany regarding the entry of German troops into Romanian territory. The first dispatch urged Germany to note that Southeast Europe is regarded as Germany's economic hinterland, but not its political hinterland. It is said that Germany replied that there are signs that Britain is preparing to attack Southeast Europe, and Germany has therefore had to adopt a military plan to ensure the fulfillment of Southeast Europe's economic obligations to Germany. The Soviet Union's second dispatch inquired as to the purpose of the German troops' deep penetration into Romanian territory, and whether Germany was aware that some Romanian and Hungarian elements harbored the idea of assisting Germany in attacking the Soviet Union. Germany reportedly replied that Germany's mission was to create a defensive structure in Romania, not an offensive one. According to people in Bucharest, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will soon go to Moscow in an attempt to persuade the Soviet Union to join the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. Nazi propaganda in the area is now trying to promote the idea that German-Soviet relations will be closer in the future and will not be alienated by Britain. However, military authorities are still receiving reports that the Soviet Union is engaged in large-scale defense plans in Bessarabia, and it is rumored that the railroad there is now dedicated to military transport. However, the Romanian Communist Party does not believe that there will be a rapid conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union, because, according to telegrams from Moscow, the Soviet Union will not suddenly change its attitude toward Germany, because the Soviet Union does not want to conflict with Germany at this time.

Romania's Situation Deteriorates Daily; People Filled with Sadness and Indignation

Vienna: The entry of German troops into Romania is still more a matter of moving troops to find food than a military occupation. German staff members and soldiers seem to be focusing on finding the best restaurants, rather than finding strategic gun emplacements. Political circles here believe that Germany's flaunting of its mechanized forces is intended to protect the Iron Guard, to avoid internal political opposition or the disloyalty of soldiers, and not only to defend the borders. German soldiers are now systematically sending food packages home every week. German officers have begun to make dissatisfied criticisms of entering and leaving the streets, so they have changed into civilian clothes to avoid people's attention. There is now evidence to show that even members of the Iron Guard do not fully welcome the deep penetration of German troops. The Iron Guard members in outer Transylvania are said to be extremely resentful that Germany not only transferred most of outer Transylvania to Hungary, but also sent troops directly into Romania, and they have destroyed their blue shirts and accused their Iron Guard comrades of not agreeing to the Vienna territorial cession to Hungary, and have asked them to join the Aid to Outer Transylvania Association led by former Romanian Prime Minister Maniu, which aims to recover lost territory. Secret short-wave wireless broadcasts have recently been heard throughout Romania, warning Iron Guard leader and acting Prime Minister Sima that if he does not want to die, he should quickly go to the mountains. These wireless broadcasts are definitely being sent out by dissatisfied members of the Iron Guard. At the same time, the Romanian newspapers are also crying out about the rapid rise in the cost of living, with the price of bread and other goods doubling, and the people's food is gradually becoming scarce. In order to comfort the people, the government has announced measures to improve stores, selling food only to registered customers. (20th Reuters Electric)

### Turkey Investigates the National Population

Istanbul. Today, Turkey is conducting a national population census. All 18 million Turkish people and all foreigners residing in Turkey must stay at home for ten hours and are not allowed to go out until a cannon is fired to indicate that the census is complete. This is the third national population census since the establishment of the Turkish Republic. It was never conducted in the past during the imperial era. Except for the 16,000 officials investigating the population, there are no pedestrians on the streets of Istanbul. Residents who disobey the order to go out will be fined or imprisoned.

Antries also said that Yugoslavia will not export any goods without surplus to Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Hungarian Miners Brew Strike with Political Background

Budapest. The strike wave involving 40,000 miners and thousands of other workers has now reached its extreme. The Sakota mine was restless last week. The miners demanded a 50% wage increase. The Hungarian government immediately prepared to make concessions to compensate for the sharp rise in living costs, but the labor unrest gradually spread, and other mines followed suit, which was obviously related to the activities of the fifth column of the Hungarian Arrow Cross Party, which was instructed by the Nazi Party. The radical elements of the party are suspected of inciting the miners. This labor unrest coincided with Major General Czelassy's visit to Vienna to meet with senior Nazi Party members. The beggar government is now handling the labor unrest with vigilance and gentle means to prevent it from turning into a major political event. Observers regard this entire event as extremely meaningful. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Only two of them flew to the outskirts of London and dropped five bombs before leaving. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

London. German bombers caused significant damage to London again today. Two pubs and the air-raid shelter of a hospital were directly hit. The attack started on Saturday night and, after a long pause, London lifted the air-raid alert. However, less than an hour after the alert was lifted, the raiders returned to the British capital, launching a horrific attack from midnight until Sunday morning. Countless customers who were feasting in the pubs were killed after the two pubs were hit. A club and a cafe were also destroyed. Incendiary bombs started fires in several areas, but the situation was quickly brought under control.

London. Before dawn this morning, German planes, in two batches, bombarded London with the most violent high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. The bombs dropped by the German planes in the chaos were all effective. A large hotel, two clubhouses, a hospital, and a public air-raid shelter were all hit by bombs. In addition, several other houses and residences were also bombed. German planes used the bright moon and clear weather to bomb the British capital for several hours without ceasing. The British's fierce anti-aircraft fire immediately rose to deal with it. The dense anti-aircraft fire throughout the city forced most German planes to stay at high altitudes. At the same time, it was also heard that Liverpool encountered the longest air raid. Many residences were destroyed and damaged, including an uninhabited nursery. The Nazi night hawks spread throughout the three islands of Central England last night and concentrated their fierce attacks on London. In the city center and surrounding areas of London, bombs fell like rain, and the losses were heavy. This was a night raid, and many women and children in London died, which can be called an unprecedented disaster. In a certain area, a row of houses was completely turned into ruins by a huge bomb. A nearby hospital was directly hit by a bomb. It is believed that the number of casualties in this area must be high. (International dispatch, 20th)

The Kiel naval base was also fiercely bombed. British planes also attacked the shipyards of Hamburg, Emden, and Lubeck separately. Due to the dense ground fog and low clouds, it was impossible to accurately see the results of the attack, but it is believed that the Hamburg Germania shipyard has also been severely damaged. The weather encountered by British bombers operating in the Ruhr area was quite favorable for the attack. Taking advantage of the bright moonlight, they quickly found the important aluminum plant in Ruhr, braved the fierce and accurate anti-aircraft fire, and dropped tons of high-explosive bombs and a large number of incendiary bombs on the target. According to the pilots, the factory area was bombed, causing violent explosions and flames, similar to large Chinese firecrackers. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### U.S. Presidential Election Intensifies; Key Figures Deliver Speeches

Washington – With the U.S. presidential election just weeks away, the Democratic and Republican parties have entered the final decisive stage of a large-scale political battle. Political observers here believe that the Democratic Party has recently shown signs of unease, while the Republican Party has become more optimistic. However, neither party is entirely confident about the election outcome. The competition between President Roosevelt and Willkie appears to be decided by a toss of a coin, but based on opinions from various quarters, Roosevelt seems to have a slight advantage. (20th International News Service)

Washington – Political speeches in the U.S. presidential campaign intensified this week. President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver five major speeches starting Wednesday in Philadelphia. Republican presidential candidate Willkie's speech in Minneapolis, which garnered approval from some quarters, and the speech by New York District Attorney Dewey, who was defeated by Willkie in the Republican primary, were noteworthy. In political talks across the country on Friday evening, California Republican Senator Johnson's keynote address expressed support for Willkie. Willkie is still residing in his special train and will travel to Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan to deliver speeches. Democratic vice-presidential candidate and Secretary of Agriculture Wallace also delivered a speech in Canton, Ohio, on Friday evening, accusing Wall Street financiers of attempting to incite the people against the government. Furthermore, Secretary of the Interior Ickes delivered a speech in St. Louis on Friday evening, accusing the public utility industry led by Willkie of attempting to control the federal government. Senator Donner, a colleague of Senator Johnson, advocated for Roosevelt's third term in a speech in Los Angeles. Minnesota Governor Stassen, in a speech in St. Joseph, Missouri, even claimed that the New Deal could not increase national defense production. On the other hand, supporters of the New Deal, such as Federal Security Administrator McNutt, delivered a speech in Rock Island, Illinois, and New York Mayor La Guardia also spoke in Boston, condemning Willkie.

European War Anecdotes (20) (1)

### New Position for the Duke of Windsor

The Duke of Windsor, who "gave up his kingdom for love," formerly King Edward VIII of England, has been inseparable from his American wife, Mrs. Simpson, ever since their marriage. They truly deserve to be the most affectionate couple in the world. They were originally living in France as residents, and after the outbreak of the European war, they returned to their country to serve. He initially served as a liaison officer for the Anglo-French Allied Forces, and later his brother, George VI, appointed him as the Governor of the Bahamas, which was also a significant "goodwill mission" to the United States. The Duke of Windsor gladly accepted the appointment and left Europe for Bermuda in early August, then transferred to the Bahamas. On the 17th, he took his official oath in the capital, Nassau. To have such a former King who abandoned his crown as if it were worn-out shoes and once caused a sensation around the world, come to this small island in the Atlantic Ocean to serve as a civil governor and commander-in-chief of the army and navy is already a great appeal in terms of personality alone. With the American newspapers adding to the hype, people with strong curiosity and Americans who sympathized with the Duke of Windsor took advantage of the excitement to visit the Bahamas. The saying "outstanding people make a place outstanding" is certainly true. The following is a translation based on reports from "The New York Times," "The Christian Science Monitor," and "Time":

Compared to the position of King of Great Britain, the position of Governor of the Bahamas is truly insignificant. The Bahamian archipelago is northeast of Cuba and includes 18 small islands, 661 reefs, and more than 2,000 reef chains scattered in the Atlantic Ocean, in addition to the island of "New Providence," where the capital, Nassau, is located. The British territory formerly ruled by King Edward VIII of England covered more than 13.32 million square miles, with a population of 495 million. Now, the area of the Bahamas Islands is 4,666 square miles, with a total population of 67,000, three-quarters of whom live in "New Providence."

The disparity in importance between the throne relinquished by the Duke of Windsor and the governorship he now holds is immeasurable, so let's not dwell on it. Another strange thing is that the object to whom he swore allegiance and obedience is his own brother, George VI. Extraordinary people do extraordinary things, and the Duke of Windsor can be said to deserve the title.

On the day of their departure from Europe for Bermuda, they boarded the 9,359-ton passenger-cargo ship "Excalibur." The entire voyage across the Atlantic takes eight days. Although this ship is a freighter, this particular voyage was indeed carrying some distinguished guests. The passenger list was headed by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, followed by U.S. Ambassador to Italy Philip and his daughter, U.S. Ambassador to Poland Biddle and his wife, U.S. Minister to the Netherlands Gordon and his wife, and other dignitaries.

The Duchess of Windsor boarded in Lisbon and brought with her three beagles, 52 pieces of luggage, a hand-cranked sewing machine, golf clubs, four wicker baskets filled with fine vintage wines, a 1940s-style car, and a family-style trailer. As for the Duke of Windsor, he lingered at a reception at the home of the Portuguese tycoon Sherva and arrived at the dock late. The "Excalibur" had to wait and not set sail for the time being. Several dignitaries, such as British Ambassador to Portugal Sir Campbell and his wife, were also waiting there to see him off. The first rule of the British royal family states: "Punctuality is the politeness of kings," but the Duke of Windsor was unrestrained and delayed for a full forty minutes before he and his host Sherva and others arrived leisurely. Three of his subordinates, all old schoolmates from Eton, also boarded the ship with him.

The Duke himself would have preferred to cross the Atlantic by "clipper" flying boat, but his wife often insisted, "I don't want to fly." It is undeniable that Windsor did not want to go against his wife's wishes, but there was another reason on the Duchess's side. It turned out that one of Mrs. Simpson's three ex-husbands had been a U.S. Navy pilot, and she was not only familiar with aircraft accidents but had also witnessed them. As a result, she hated airplanes as much as she "didn't want to see cats." She often said, "I pray that trains never have a breakdown."

After leaving Lisbon, the weather was calm, the waves were quiet, and the sea was smooth. The ship sailed on the ocean like the train in Mrs. Windsor's dreams. Before long, a "clipper" flying boat flew overhead, roaring in the air. The Duke of Windsor went up to the bridge, waved to the flying boat, and exchanged greetings with the captain of the flying boat by wireless. There was also a distinguished guest on the flying boat, but he was resting at the time and did not notice the Duke of Windsor waving on the ship. He was the French financier Baron Rothschild, who had gone abroad to take refuge. After Edward abdicated and before marrying Mrs. Simpson, he had once lived in his villa for a period of retirement.

The Windsors lived in a suite on the ship, which also had a private balcony. They hosted private banquets for the American diplomat couples on board, but they also occasionally took their dogs for walks on the public deck. The Duchess of Windsor and Mrs. Gordon, the wife of the U.S. Minister to the Netherlands, were old friends who had met in Washington. Mrs. Gordon, Alice, was the daughter of a wealthy family. In the past, every time she returned to the United States from Europe, she would bring back many fashionable clothes from Paris. Mrs. Simpson did not have much money at the time and could not afford the latest Parisian fashions, but Alice often asked her to call a female tailor to "copy" those fashions as much as possible. As a result, the two hit it off and became more than just casual acquaintances.

On August 8th, they arrived in Bermuda. The Windsors disembarked, and their 50-plus pieces of luggage were also landed. However, these boxes and bags were only personal necessities. Just the uniforms, badges, and ribbons in the "official" luggage filled several boxes. The Duke of Windsor had left these items in France and had not taken them out of the country.

On August 14th, the Windsors boarded the Canadian Steamship Company's "Lady Somers" and set off from Bermuda for the Bahamas to take up their new posts. A reporter from the New York Times traveled on the same ship and had the opportunity to meet the Windsors during the two-and-a-half-day voyage. His observations are roughly as follows:

The 780 miles from Bermuda to the Bahamas were patrolled by a British light cruiser, which sailed east and west, scouting everywhere. The "Lady Somers" set sail at 2:00 PM on Wednesday, and the journey proceeded without incident. In the afternoon of the 16th, a plume of smoke was suddenly spotted on the eastern horizon, and the cruiser sailed east to investigate. It was later discovered that the smoke was coming from the chimney of an American oil tanker. At this time, the Duke and Duchess were sitting in chairs on the deck, and when they saw the crew members looking east with binoculars, they asked, "Are they going to open fire?"

Every night, the entire ship was blacked out, and smoking on the deck was prohibited. There were not many passengers on board, and everyone was quite relaxed. The Windsors were quite amiable. (To be continued)

### Preliminary Discussion on China's Post-War Balance of Payments

— Yu Chongxian

A Miracle? Or Inevitability?

China's war of resistance has now reached forty months: but the external exchange rate of Chinese legal tender, despite being unarmed and surrounded by enemies, is still calm and composed. Observers both within and outside the country cannot but recognize this as a miracle in the history of war finance. Purely from an economic point of view, there is no reason for the external exchange rate of Chinese legal tender (referring to the Shanghai black market exchange rate) to remain at its current level for a long time. Considering only Shanghai's foreign trade, the monthly trade deficit has recently often exceeded three million pounds. And the national trade deficit has often exceeded six million pounds per month in recent months. Shanghai's own trade deficit should of course be paid for by seeking funds from Shanghai's foreign exchange market; as for the trade deficits in other places, a part of them is also realized through foreign payments in Shanghai's foreign exchange market through remittances from various places to Shanghai. Shanghai's foreign exchange supply cannot be inexhaustible, so from this point of view, almost everyone believes that there is no reason for the external exchange rate of Chinese currency not to collapse. However, in fact, the exchange rate of legal tender in the Shanghai black market can still show its strong resistance force; and can even rise sharply in favorable opportunities; this is the miracle in the history of wartime finance.

How can such a scene be possible? At present, there is no satisfactory explanation, or it is believed that the firmness of the exchange rate in the past few months is due to the unpredictable changes in the domestic and international situation, and the sudden occurrence of negative facts, and the spread of rumors of heavy losses. However, although adverse events continue to occur and rumors of adverse events are endless, their effect is only like the use of stimulants on the human body, which is temporary in nature; the exchange rate of legal tender can never be supported by rumors for a long time. In the long run, empty rumors cannot resist economic pressure; therefore, the stability of the legal tender exchange rate must be due to other reasons.

In any case, tangible trade deficits should be paid for with intangible income. Maintaining a stable exchange rate is equivalent to saying that our balance of payments can support the existing exchange rate level. In fact, our tangible trade imports and exports have such a huge deficit, so our intangible trade receipts and payments must have a surplus of the same amount; otherwise, the exchange rate will not be maintained. The current research should focus on: what are the items that constitute this intangible income? What is the elasticity of its contraction, and what is the direction of its change? If we can have a thorough understanding of this, it will greatly contribute to the understanding of the trend of China's wartime foreign exchange rate. However, this is very difficult to carry out, because the complexity of the issues involved, and the fact that some prerequisite issues are not easily resolved without a very long investigation time. Therefore, it is impossible to conduct a thorough study at present. Now, based on my personal views, I will briefly state this issue.

Comparison of Tangible Receipts and Payments During Wartime

China's tangible trade has always been in deficit, but China's balance of payments cannot be in deficit for a long time; therefore, there must be a method to balance it. The current research should focus on whether this balancing method still exists? Has the amount changed? At the same time, observe the current amount of the deficit and compare it with the amount of the deficit in the past. Is it increasing or decreasing? Can it be offset by the existing balance of payments method? Such indirect evidence seems to be able to clarify its general situation. Now I will explain it separately.

First, please measure our ability to support the deficit over the years. The study of this issue should use historical data as a reference. According to my rough calculation, from 1920 to 1929, in the ten years, China's average annual deficit was 200 million yuan. According to the average exchange rate in these ten years, it was 20 million pounds per year; and 1.8 million pounds per month. However, after 1930, the deficit increased rapidly. From 1930 to 1936, in the seven years, the average annual deficit was 500 million yuan; according to the average exchange rate in these seven years, it was 36 million pounds per year, and 3 million pounds per month. If these seventeen years are combined into one period, the average annual deficit is 27 million pounds, and the monthly average is 2.25 million pounds. Our balance of payments cannot be in deficit for a long time, and there must be a method to balance it. Therefore, in these seventeen years, the receipts and payments of other items must have a surplus roughly equal to this amount. Otherwise, trade and exchange will not be able to proceed smoothly.

Since the tangible trade deficit must be offset by the intangible trade surplus, then in these seventeen years, my country's foreign intangible trade must have an annual surplus of nearly 27 million pounds; the monthly average intangible balance of payments should be around 2.2 million pounds. If we only calculate the situation after 1930, the average annual intangible balance of payments should be 36 million pounds, and the monthly average should be 3 million pounds. The balance of payments over a long period of time must be balanced, which is a fixed rule in international receipts. In this way, we can assume that the above-mentioned average is my country's ability to tolerate commodity import surplus during normal times. (Ability to foartd import surplus of commodityrradfng items) If our tangible trade deficit exceeds the above-mentioned average figure, our balance of payments will have a deficit; foreign exchange reserves will be eroded. If our country's monetary authorities are unwilling to sell foreign exchange reserves to balance this deficit; then our foreign exchange rate will be lowered. On the contrary, if our tangible trade deficit is lower than the above-mentioned figure; then my country's balance of payments will have a surplus; foreign exchange reserves will be more abundant; if the monetary authorities refuse to absorb foreign exchange at a fixed price, then my country's foreign exchange rate will be squeezed higher. Based on the calculation of the above-mentioned historical data, we can proceed to discuss the post-war issue.

General Trend of International Balance of Payments Before the War

There are two issues worth noting here: how does the post-war tangible deficit compare with the pre-war period? One is what is the content of our intangible income, and has there been any change in the post-war period? And what is the possible limit of its change? Estimating these two variables, and then observing the profit and loss situation, we can understand the general situation of the post-war balance of payments. Now I will explain them separately as follows.

First, let's talk about the tangible trade deficit: from the beginning of the war in 1937 to the present, the average annual deficit, converted into pounds, is 45 million pounds, and the average monthly deficit is slightly less than 3.8 million pounds. Comparing this number with the average figure of 17 years before the war, the annual deficit has increased by 18 million pounds, and the monthly average has increased by 1.5 million pounds. If we compare it with the average figure of 7 years before the war, the annual deficit has increased by 9 million pounds, and the monthly average has increased by 800,000 pounds. The earlier the era, the less reliable it is. Therefore, it seems more reliable to base the argument on the latter calculation. In summary, we know that my country's post-war tangible deficit is indeed higher than before the war, and slightly exceeds the strength of the human overspending that we calculated earlier that we could tolerate during normal times; the annual excess is 9 million pounds, and the annual average excess is slightly less than 800,000 pounds. This is from the expenditure side.

Comparison of Intangible Receipts and Payments During Wartime

Please analyze the content of my country's intangible income, and the possible changes in the post-war period. First, explain the changes in the original income items, and then explain the newly added items in the post-war period.

According to the main items of China's intangible income, there are two: one is remittances from overseas Chinese, and the other is the expenses of foreigners in China. The former was estimated at between 300 million and 500 million yuan per year before the war, and the latter was generally estimated at more than 100 million yuan. According to the legal exchange rate of legal tender against foreign currency before the war, remittances from overseas Chinese were between 22 million and 30 million pounds per year; and the expenses of foreigners in China were 8-9 million pounds. Because the estimates of each company vary slightly, we now adopt a moderate and more general statement, assuming that the income from these two items before the war was 35 million pounds per year, which can roughly offset the annual tangible trade deficit in the seven years before the war.

What we want to study now is how has this income increased or decreased in the post-war period? First, let's talk about remittances from overseas Chinese: although most of the coastal cities of Fujian and Guangdong have fallen, the remittance channels have not been interrupted, but the difficulty has increased slightly. After the war, due to the rise in prices and the increase in relocation costs, the remittances from overseas Chinese to provide for their families must increase their amount. However, this factor should be offset by the appreciation of foreign currency; because the same amount of foreign currency can be remitted for more legal tender. In addition, some overseas Chinese families have moved to Hong Kong or overseas, so the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese after the war has greatly increased in terms of legal tender; if calculated in foreign currency, it may be reduced instead. But there is another point worth noting here, that is, overseas Chinese are very patriotic, and the amount of donations to the government after the war is quite considerable. It is estimated that the government's foreign currency income from this source totaled more than 50 million yuan in the three years after the war. This amount seems to be more than enough to offset the reduction in private remittances. Therefore, the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese after the war seems to have not decreased but increased slightly; at least it can be assumed that it has not decreased.

Regarding the expenses of foreigners in China, it seems to have decreased after the war; the reason is the withdrawal of foreigners from various places and the reduction and withdrawal of troops. However, the number of reductions should not be large, because there are many foreigners who come to China for special purposes after the war; the newly added expenses can offset a part of the reduction in the original foreign expenses. And after the war, foreigners donated a lot to my country for medical relief, etc.; the total of this cumulative calculation, the expenses of foreigners in China after the war may have increased instead.

In summary, it can be seen that the surplus of my country's intangible income to offset the tangible deficit seems to have not weakened compared with the pre-war period. If the tangible deficit after the war still maintains the pre-war level, the balance of payments after the war may not be difficult. However, as mentioned above, our tangible deficit after the war has indeed increased compared with the pre-war period. The cumulative increase in the past three years has been more than 30 million pounds. How is this number balanced? At the same time, there is still a huge amount of foreign exchange held by the people, how should this be explained? All of this is what I want to explain finally.

Regarding this point, we should study the newly added income items in the post-war period. What are these newly added income items? Now I will list them as follows:

The government's disposition of a portion of foreign exchange reserves. According to the statistics, from the beginning of the war to the implementation of the foreign exchange examination system in March of the following year, the government sold foreign exchange to stabilize the exchange market, which is estimated to be about 20 million pounds. After that, during the period of implementation of the foreign exchange examination system, another 5 million pounds were disposed of successively; since the attempt to stabilize the exchange market in August of the previous year, to the period of activity of the Sino-British Equalization Fund, the foreign exchange sold but not bought back is also estimated to be about 5 million pounds. The foreign exchange positions released by the government in these three is also between 30 million pounds. This number is enough to balance the total expenditure difference after adding the tangible and intangible receipts and payments after the war.

Based on the above estimation, plus the foreign exchange disposed of by the government, in the three years after the war. My country's total receipts and payments seem to be balanced. But why is there still a part of the foreign exchange held by the people in Shanghai? This can be regarded as the accumulated surplus of receipts and payments in the past three years, because it has not been used for foreign payments. But why must there still be other income, so that this part of the foreign exchange can not be used? Regarding this point, I have the following opinions:

(1) After the war, a considerable amount of legal tender flowed overseas for price changes; this should be one of the newly added income for us. It is estimated that the legal tender flowing to Hong Kong, excluding the government's, is 400 million yuan, which is equivalent to 10 million pounds.

(2) Funds from the Nanyang area (including Hong Kong) have flowed inward in the past year. Although a reliable estimate cannot be made for this amount now, the total amount must be quite considerable. The above two factors seem to be very important for the question of why we have a foreign surplus in the past three years? (That is, some foreign exchange in Shanghai's private sector has not been used)

The above is my tentative explanation of China's balance of payments in the past three years. From this, we can know that the intangible income that we can use to offset the tangible deficit has not decreased compared with the pre-war period. However, our tangible deficit is slightly higher than the average level before the war; but it has not decreased to the point where it cannot be supported. This is probably an intrinsic great force for why the external exchange rate of my country's legal tender can still maintain a relatively stable level after a long war of three years.

Editor's note: The fluctuations in the Shanghai black market exchange market cannot be fully explained by the international balance of payments situation; and the changes in the exchange market can in turn affect the international balance of payments. Mr. Yu pointed out that the stability of the exchange market before the foreign exchange control was due to the government's full supply, which is very true. However, the amount of the deficit at that time was not as large as it is today, and the amount of foreign donations and offerings was indeed large. It is a pity that the capital flight before and after the war was also extremely large. However, the two offset each other, and even if there was still a deficit, it would probably not be large. Therefore, the so-called loss suffered by the government due to maintenance may not be very large. However, after the implementation of the exchange control and even the occurrence of the black market exchange market, the situation changed greatly. Because the greater the distance between the black exchange and the legal price, the higher the degree of capital flight and speculation; the driving force of capital flight, in addition to the economic point of view, must also come from the political point of view. And the advancement of speculative fever, if there is effective crackdown, it will definitely not be like this; therefore, it can also be said that it is related to politics. The increase in capital flight and speculation has greatly affected the international balance of payments; and further reflects its impact on the black market exchange market, and finally creates the current phenomenon. Today, the situation is different again, because the phenomenon of capital flight induced from a political point of view has decreased, even disappearing; and most of it flows back. The decline in capital flight has shaken the foreign exchange bullish speculative front; and the return of fleeing capital has further strengthened the short speculative front. And the international war clouds are dense, and the war is approaching; the feasibility of international trade is becoming smaller, and the need for foreign exchange is even more affected. These facts, psychologically, are even more sufficient to promote the short-selling force. Therefore, according to Yu's view, the change in the black exchange price is not the result of the international balance of payments; and the current situation of the international balance of payments is affected by the black exchange price; and the black market exchange market is mainly composed of speculators; and the views of these speculators are mostly pessimistic. Therefore, it is more approximate to explain the purchasing power of legal tender expressed on the black market exchange market from a political point of view than to analyze it from an economic point of view. However, under the influence of the black market exchange market, what is the situation of my country's international balance of payments? Mr. Yu's article has contributed many unique insights.

### Our Wartime Finance (Continued Completion)

— Yu Xielin

Appropriate Wartime Public Debt Policy

According to the established practice of wartime finance in various countries, the expenditure to pay for war expenses is less taken from increased taxes, and more taken from raising debts. Because raising debts conforms to the principles of agility and convenience, it can raise huge sums of money in a short period of time to cope with sudden changes in extraordinary times, or the huge expenditure of war expenses, which taxes cannot match. However, if all war expenses are relied on public debt, the issuance of excess amounts will inevitably lead to vicious inflation. The repeated mistakes of Germany and France during the last war are still vivid. Therefore, the wartime public debt policy, if not handled properly, will inevitably leave endless harm. Therefore, our country's financial authorities have always adopted a prudent attitude towards the public debt policy, and have never had a huge amount of issuance from beginning to end, so that the national economy has suffered greatly. Since the beginning of the war, our country has successively issued the 26th Year National Salvation Public Debt of 500 million yuan; the 27th Year National Defense Public Debt of 500 million yuan; the 27th Year Gold Public Debt includes 100 million units of customs gold, 10 million pounds of British gold, and 50 million yuan of US gold. According to the price set by the government, it is equivalent to more than 550 million yuan of national currency; the 27th Year Relief Public Debt of 100 million yuan, the first phase of 30 million yuan; the 28th Year Construction Public Debt of 600 million yuan; the 28th Year Military Public Debt of 600 million yuan; the 29th Year Construction Gold Public Debt includes 10 million pounds of British gold and 50 million yuan of US gold. According to the price set by the government, it is equivalent to more than 700 million yuan of national currency; the 29th Year Military Public Debt of 1.2 billion yuan. The total is only 1.7-1.8 billion yuan, and a part of it has not actually been issued yet, such as the 29th Year Construction Gold Public Debt, which is issued in two phases, and the second phase must be issued on November 1 this year. This quantity is very small compared with Japan. The following characteristics can be obtained from the above. (1) From the Anti-Japanese War to last year, that is, the second period, the government attaches equal importance to the Anti-Japanese War and national construction, so it issued military public debt to pay for war expenses, and construction public debt to engage in national construction. (2) The issuance of gold public debt is to absorb the foreign exchange or foreign currency owned by the people in the country, and to facilitate the purchase of overseas Chinese, so as to replenish the legal tender reserve and enhance my country's wartime foreign purchasing power. (3) During this wartime, the government did not forget the natural disasters suffered by the localities, so it issued relief public debt to relieve the people who suffered from the Yellow River flood. Observing the issuance regulations of our country's wartime public debt, the following characteristics can also be obtained: (1) The interest rate is lower, such as the National Salvation Public Debt of 2%, which can be called the first in the history of our domestic debt. The gold public debt in the 17th year is 4%, and the construction gold public debt in the 29th year is 5%, and the rest are still 6%. (2) The discount is reduced. The wartime public debt was only issued at 98 for the relief public debt in the 27th year, and 94 for the military public debt in the 29th year, and the rest were all issued at full value, which is indeed a major reform of our country's public debt system. The issuance of our country's wartime public debt can reduce the interest and discount compared with peacetime public debt. This phenomenon is rare in Chinese and foreign history. This is because our country's finances are gradually becoming sound, and the people are enthusiastically subscribing.

As the saying goes: "Those who gain the Tao get more help." Our country is fighting for world justice, so British and American people have expressed sympathy for our country's Anti-Japanese War and have given us financial assistance. For example, the railway loan in the 17th year and October was 150 million French francs and 140,000 pounds; the Soviet Union's two-way barter loan of 100 million US dollars in the same year; the US loan of 25 million yuan in November of the same year; the British currency loan of 5 million pounds in January of the 28th year. There are many others that have been established but have not been officially announced. The rest are mostly used for barter in the form of gold to repay principal and interest. The utilization of foreign capital in this way will surely be of great help to the promotion of our country's construction. And at the time of repayment of principal and interest, it is not enough to increase the financial burden, and can improve the balance of payments.

Sound Wartime Issuance System

In addition to increasing taxes and raising debts, there is also issuing banknotes to raise war expenses. If we rely on issuing banknotes to pay for huge war expenses, although it is the most convenient, it is also the most dangerous. It is most likely to cause vicious inflation, making finance collapse and unable to extricate itself. Therefore, our country's wartime issuance still adopts the prudent policy of the past. At the end of June in the 26th year—before the outbreak of the war—the total amount of issuance by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank was 1.40720234 billion yuan, and the cash reserve at that time was 916.518353 million yuan, and the ratio was more than 65%. By the end of June of the 27th year, the total amount of issuance was 1.726997835 billion yuan, and the cash reserve was only 1.132811067 billion yuan, and the ratio was still more than 65%. By the end of June of the 18th year, the total amount of issuance was 2.6269292 billion yuan, and the cash reserve was 1.156088974 billion yuan, and the ratio was 44%. At the end of June this year, the total amount of issuance was 3.961144205 billion yuan, and the cash reserve was 1.917526050 billion yuan, and the ratio was more than 48%. From the surface, in the past three years, the amount of legal tender issued has increased by two times. However, because the circulation area of legal tender is increasingly expanding, and the demand for currency in various places is increasingly urgent, the amount of issuance should naturally increase. Before the war, the amount of issuance was too small, and all provinces in the interior felt that the chips were insufficient. Although the current amount of issuance has increased sharply, there is still a feeling of currency contraction in various places from time to time. It can be seen that the amount of issuance in our country is not only not excessive. As for the percentage of cash reserve, although it has been reduced, it is still more than 48% to this day, which is more than that of advanced countries. As for the redemption of silver deposits, the increase in gold production, and the fact that the gold and silver collected are all used to replenish the issuance reserve, the cash reserve can also increase rapidly with the total amount of issuance, so that the foundation of legal tender is becoming more solid.

Conclusion

Our country, which is economically backward and financially poor, has been able to fight for three years, and has been able to cope with the huge war expenses with ease and without difficulty. This is really beyond everyone's expectations. From this, we can see the greatness of our country's potential power. Our country's financial authorities have been able to bury themselves in hard work, improve the tax system, raise public debt extensively, and use the issuance of banknotes to cope with the vast war expenses in the midst of great difficulties. So that our financial system is becoming sounder day by day, and the financial foundation is becoming more and more solid. The beginning has just been opened, and continued efforts are still needed.

### Soviet Trade Capital

— Mr. Wu Yugan's Answer

Shen Chengzhao: Thank you for your questions. In addition to the Soviet-German financial system, which was answered in the previous issue of this magazine, the Soviet-German trade system was answered by Professor Wu Yugan, an international trade expert, a long time ago. The part about Germany has been published in the previous issue. The Soviet part will be published as follows:

How is the Soviet international trade method different from that of the United States and Britain?

The difference between Soviet international trade and that of the United States and Britain is that Soviet foreign trade is completely operated by the state, and is monopolized by the state; while the United States and Britain are freely operated by the private sector. Soviet international trade is to handle all matters related to trade guidance, organization, planning, and operation by the state. The central organ of her trade (People's Committee for Foreign Trade) and other important organs such as foreign commercial representatives guide everything, and also form many companies. The import and export business is distributed to these import and export trading companies. These companies handle all matters related to foreign orders and sales. However, foreign orders must be licensed by the People's Committee for Trade, and exports only need to be reported. It has also been authorized by the government to sign trade agreements with foreign experts. These companies mostly operate different types of special commodities, such as machinery imports, which are completely entrusted to the "Mlachinoimporc" import company, and oil exports are completely handed over to the "Soyusneftoxport" export company; occasionally, the import and export trade of a certain region is completely operated by one company. They are all managed by the People's Committee for Trade. The result of the Soviet Union's use of this state-run trade method is that it is particularly sufficient to meet the needs of its own economy, and at the same time it is easy to promote international political and diplomatic relations, which is beyond the reach of the trade method freely operated by the private sector in the United States and Britain.

### Financial Review —October 19th—

— By Sheng Kaiqiong

The joint office of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank has resolved to implement six measures for broadly establishing simple savings offices, aiming to promote savings services not only in major cities but also extensively in smaller counties, towns, and various industrial and commercial centers. The Central Trust Bureau and the Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank will actively prepare for this.

Since its reorganization in September of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the joint office of the four banks has already decided to implement the wartime financial and economic plans it formulated. This includes promoting rediscounting operations, establishing a financial network, publicly inspecting the reserve funds issued by the four banks, and broadly promoting the work of gold and silver purchase. The current focus is on concentrating capital and promoting special savings. The most concrete measure for concentrating capital is the requirement in the management regulations for banks that the four banks receive 20% of the reserve funds from the deposits of other banks. The method for promoting special savings is the establishment of a National Savings Promotion Committee for Saving the Nation. On September 6th of this year, it jointly organized a National Savings Movement Committee for Saving the Nation, together with the national committee, and directed the Central Trust Bureau and the Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank to actively prepare for the establishment of simple savings offices.

After carefully reading the measures for establishing simple savings offices, I believe there are three characteristics that must be pointed out: First, the economic environment for establishing simple savings offices differs from the economic environment where the financial network is deployed. This includes places that (1) have a population of over 30,000 but no financial institutions; (2) mining areas with a large number of workers, or concentrated sections and stations along railway and highway lines; (3) cultural areas with a concentration of schools; (4) production and distribution centers for major special products; (5) inland ports with flourishing commerce and a large circulation of banknotes; and (6) large factories with over 500 workers. Second, although simple savings offices can handle all savings businesses like general savings banks, their main focus is on attracting deposits, such as paying special attention to attracting small deposits, promoting national savings bonds for saving the nation, and prize-linked savings bonds. Remittances and loans are only auxiliary, such as small remittances and small loans, which can be handled concurrently when necessary. Third, the interest rate for attracting savings in simple savings offices is higher than the interest rate for attracting savings in general savings banks. The principle is a 5% annual interest rate for demand deposits and a 10% annual interest rate for time deposits, and adjustments can be made based on local conditions, without being restricted by general savings regulations.

From the three points analyzed above, it can be seen that the function of simple savings offices in China's wartime finance is the same as the temporary measures for managing banks and has three major effects: (1) It can increase deposits in national banks, which can be used to develop resources and all production undertakings. Therefore, simple savings offices focus on receiving deposits so that national banks can centrally manage funds after they are concentrated. (2) It can reduce social circulation of money by saving consumption and stabilize rising prices. Therefore, simple savings offices set interest rates higher than general banks' demand deposit rates. (3) It can reduce the amount of legal tender in circulation and return it to the issuing bank to curb inflation. Therefore, the economic environment for establishing simple savings offices should be smaller counties and towns and various industrial and commercial centers.

Simple savings offices not only have the function of managing banks but also have the function of saving the nation through national savings. Furthermore, they have the function of remedying the shortcomings of both managing banks and saving the nation through national savings. Regarding the management of banks, the funds that can be concentrated are only 20% of what banks can concentrate. There are still funds scattered among the people that banks cannot absorb, and government banks cannot absorb 20% of the reserve funds. Now, by universally establishing simple savings offices with the reputation of the four banks, although it is a complex matter, the results will far exceed the level of only being able to transfer and absorb 20%. As for national savings bonds for saving the nation, whether they are type A or type B, they are all time-bound, with the shortest deposit period being six months. This is convenient for those who prefer time deposits, but inconvenient for those who only want demand deposits. Now, simple savings offices use a 5% annual interest rate to attract demand deposits. Depositors enjoy preferential interest, the convenience of depositing and withdrawing at any time, and the guarantee of capital security. The simple savings offices do not operate their private silver vaults, and as a result, they will be able to concentrate funds on a large scale and exert the three major effects discussed earlier.

Therefore, the widespread establishment of simple savings offices by the four banks is indeed the expansion of the national savings network. It is hoped that it can be established quickly in various places to adapt to the great development of the national savings movement for saving the nation personally led by Generalissimo Chiang.

Is Zha Chi Specializing in Futures?

Yesterday's newspaper published a news item stating that Zha Chi's trading is limited to spot goods. Although there is also buying and selling short, all are prepared with real goods. Recently, due to the abundance of floating capital in this port, the wealthy and general merchants are all buying gold for storage, and some are secretly buying large amounts, leading to a shortage of funds. The industry cannot close positions, and the market authorities will reform and plan to specialize in futures, with settlement at maturity.

The Shanghai Gold Standard Market was suspended after the war, and general brokers formed the Zha Chi trading market in a certain bank. In the past, the market price of Zha Chi fluctuated with foreign exchange, so since the black market of foreign exchange has seen repeated ups and downs, the market price of Zha Chi has also seen high prices, with a record high of 7,200. However, during that time, because the pound price fell in the European war, although foreign exchange was controlled, the free pound price in the New York market was difficult to stabilize. As a result, the fluctuations of Zha Chi turned to depend on the fluctuations of the US dollar.

However, although it has generally followed the US dollar this week, due to the short squeeze, the fluctuations of Zha Chi are no longer restricted by the US dollar. The degree of its rise and fall no longer coincides with the US dollar. For example, this week, the closing price of the US dollar in the foreign exchange market increased from 5.78125 to 5.84375, while Zha Chi increased from 5,658 yuan to 5,830 yuan.

The reason for this short squeeze is that the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly dangerous, and foreign exchange is being held long. Those who generally preserve US dollars believe that if the United States and Japan have a war in the Pacific, the US dollar will inevitably fall in price. Therefore, storing gold is a great way to preserve wealth. However, read the announcement issued by the joint office of the four banks: "Some say that buying and storing gold bars is the most reliable because it is real goods. However, it is not known that gold has long been nationalized. The environment in Shanghai is special, and government laws and regulations cannot be implemented in time, so a black market for gold has emerged, and the value is soaring... In the future, when the war of resistance is completed, even if the government does not confiscate it, it will collect it at the legal price, and those who buy and store it will suffer a great loss." Therefore, those who buy gold in Shanghai today and think that storing gold is a great way to preserve wealth are truly mistaken.

### Sugar Market Trading Is Quiet

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable, and trading was quiet. The spot price of No. 24 raw white sugar at the outer warehouse was 74.2 yuan, and the price of transshipment goods was 59 yuan, both slightly lower. The price of Taikoo refined white sugar DY mark was slightly soft, 68.7 yuan at the east warehouse, slightly lower, and 69.1 yuan at the west warehouse. The spot price of Dutch red sugar continued to soften, at 56.35 yuan, slightly lower.

### Charcoal Sales Are Limited, Shortage of Wen Charcoal Is Not Important

Although the source of charcoal is hopeless because the Hana round ship on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line was forced to turn back, charcoal merchants are taking this opportunity to raise prices. Wenzhou grade A charcoal is already shouting for 18 yuan per bundle. However, the spot goods are exhausted, and drawing cakes to satisfy hunger is in vain. Other charcoals, such as Haimen flat-cap charcoal, are sold for 15 yuan per load, and small basket Huangyan charcoal also requires about 13 yuan. Although there are some spot goods on the market, they are also collected at high prices by large households and concentrated for hoarding. In fact, since the manufacture of briquettes as fuel, the sales of charcoal are limited to households for cooking and kindling fire. The market is limited, so the shortage is not a problem for people's livelihood. However, most of the firewood and charcoal shops in this street have no goods to sell. Only a few who have stocks in storage live as rare goods, and some even sell for 5 jiao per catty, asking for prices from the sky, which is astonishing.

### Maintaining the Status Quo in the South Pacific, the United States Has the Determination to Aid China, the Evacuation of Overseas Chinese Proves This Fact, the United States Was Deceived by Japan's Temperance, and in Europe, it Is Extremely Helpful to Britain

A certain American observer in this port had a long conversation with a visitor yesterday about the international situation. According to him, the current policy of the United States is to actively assist Britain in Europe and actively assist China in Asia. President Roosevelt recently gave a speech stating that the United States has decided to continue its assistance to Britain, because the country's heroic war prevents aggressors from approaching the American coast. It is true that Britain's decision to fight against Germany is not only to defend Britain's own interests.

The United States Will Deliver Flying Fortresses

According to the gentleman, British mainland and colonial arsenals are now rushing to build various new types of tanks, automatic cannons, light anti-aircraft guns, flat-shooting guns, and tractors. It is expected that Britain will have the upper hand in future battles. As for the news in the New York Herald that the United States has delivered 36 "Flying Fortresses" to Britain, although the British War Office has not explicitly admitted it, according to the observer, there is a great possibility.

Evacuation of Overseas Chinese Indicates Determination to Aid China

As for the Far East, the United States not only has the determination to aid China, but also has a major determination to maintain the status quo in the South Pacific. This can be proved by the US government's active evacuation of overseas Chinese. The US government's evacuation of overseas Chinese in the Far East has not been suspended due to Japan's temporary moderation. The Americans know Japan's diplomatic skills very well. When the general situation is favorable to Japan, they will become tough again.

Not Deceived, Expanding the Embargo

Recently, Japanese spokespersons have repeatedly explained that the Tripartite Pact is not aimed at the United States, but to ease the general anti-Japanese sentiment of the American people. Now, the US authorities have clearly stated that they will not be deceived and will plan to expand the scope of the embargo and impose economic sanctions on Japan. On the other hand, they are considering huge loans to China and, if necessary, sending aircraft to China to protect the reopened Yunnan-Burma Road. All these measures will slightly adjust and stabilize the world order.

American Overseas Chinese in Pingjin Prepare to Come to Shanghai

Since Pingjin was occupied by the Japanese army, American commercial firms have been squeezed out and cannot stand. Even the Mobil Oil Company, which used to be very prosperous, has seen its business exceptionally depressed due to the Japanese merchants' seizure of the market for kerosene. Japan is not an oil-producing country. Japanese oil is purchased from the United States, Iran, the Dutch East Indies, Mexico, and other places. It is purchased and transported to China by the Japanese and is completely monopolized. The profits of American merchants are seized by the Japanese, and the people in the interior are also exploited by the monopoly. In recent months, Japanese oil has accounted for two-thirds of the imported kerosene in North China, while companies such as Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco account for only one-third. It is said that the monopoly system in North China has also been extended to Central China. The Tianjin Mobil Oil Company has decided to close down due to business difficulties and the current situation. Chinese employees have been dismissed, and American employees are also preparing to leave Tianjin for Shanghai and take a boat back home. As for the American commercial banks in Pingjin, due to the unstable local situation and unstable currency, deposits have increased and business is still good. The Citibank in the British Concession of Tianjin, which is the leading foreign bank in Tianjin, is said to be preparing to close down.

Evacuation Ships Continuously Sail West

Yesterday, according to news from the American overseas Chinese, the ships sent by the US government to the Far East to carry back evacuated overseas Chinese are now continuously sailing west. The Washington has already set sail the day before yesterday, and the Montclair also sailed from Los Angeles on the 16th and will arrive in Yokohama on the 29th. 425 American overseas Chinese in this port have decided to take the ship back to their country. It is also said that the ship may go to Qinhuangdao to pick up the American overseas Chinese there. The Mariposa is scheduled to depart from Honolulu on the 30th of this month and will also arrive in Shanghai on the 9th of next month.

All Four American Mail Ships Are Fully Booked

Currently, the passenger seats on the scheduled President ships of the American Mail Steamship Company in this port to the United States are fully booked. These four scheduled American mail ships are: (1) the President Pierce, which will depart on the 31st of this month; (2) the President Harrison, which will depart on the 3rd of next month; (3) the President Coolidge, which will depart next month; and (4) the President Garfield, which will depart in the middle of next month. Although the above four mail ships are fully booked.

### Taking Action Against Illegal Activities of Industrial and Commercial Groups, Two Ministries Approve Punishment Measures

Since the winter of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], many employees of industrial and commercial groups have understood the righteousness and worked hard for the war of resistance, but there are also some who abuse the name of the group and engage in illegal activities. Now, the National Government has approved three draft measures for punishing illegal activities of employees of industrial and commercial groups. These measures have been slightly revised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and have been reviewed by the Central Social Affairs Ministry and found to be no different. They have been promulgated to the provincial governments and ordered to inform their subordinates.

### Lin'an and Zhuji Are Recaptured One After Another

Since the Japanese army secretly crossed the Qiantang River last year, they have been entrenched in Xiaoshan. The troops who attempted to invade Linpu were blocked and repelled by the Chinese army, and there was no major deployment, so the battle situation was relatively stable. Unexpectedly, starting on the 11th of this month, the Japanese army suddenly moved in several directions. Lin'an and Zhuji were once lost, but were recovered after a fierce counterattack by the defending army. The Datong News Agency reporter recently investigated the situation from Zhejiang groups in Shanghai, as follows.

The Chinese army counterattacked the Japanese army in Xiaoshan County. On the 11th of this month, the Japanese army suddenly advanced from Puyang to Zhuji. The Japanese army along the Fuchun River also secretly crossed the river and infiltrated Tonglu, Xindeng, and Lin'an in several directions. On the 14th, Xindeng and Lin'an were lost. The commander-in-chief of the × Army Group of the Eastern War Zone personally led reinforcements to launch a fierce counterattack, and finally recovered Lin'an. The Japanese army invading Tonglu also burned civilian houses along the way and retreated.

The battle was fierce, but the Japanese army constantly reinforced from Xiaoshan to Zhuji and sent aircraft to cover the Japanese army's ground operations. The fighting was very intense. The battle spread from the northwest of Zhuji to the suburbs. On the afternoon of the 17th, the Chinese army's reinforcements lost contact, and the county seat was finally lost. At that time, the troops that had recovered Lin'an had already crossed the river and arrived, and the elite troops in the rear also arrived one after another, so they surrounded Zhuji City on three sides, west, south, and north, and attacked fiercely. The Japanese army could not hold on and broke through on the dawn of the 18th. The Chinese army recovered Zhuji County on the morning of the 19th.

The Japanese bombed Zhejiang Province. Zhejiang groups in Shanghai received the following telegram from eastern Zhejiang: (1) At 3:24 PM on the 19th, a Japanese ship sailing from the northwest in the Chuanshan waters fired five shells at Jintang Mountain. The shells fell on the sandy beach and there was no loss to the Chinese side. It then sailed east. (2) At 3:25 PM on the 19th, a Japanese ship sailing from the north in the Shipu waters fired two shells at the Shipu coast. After firing the shells, the ship and the previously anchored Japanese ship left to the north. (3) On the 19th, it was drizzling and foggy in Ningbo, and the weather was bad. Japanese aircraft disappeared and did not dare to move. Also, yesterday (20th) at 9:30 AM, although it was also drizzling and foggy, the air pressure was higher. A Japanese aircraft invaded Fengqiao from Zhuji and dropped four bombs. The bombs fell in the wilderness and there was no loss. After the Japanese aircraft ravaged, it fled to the southwest. Ningbo did not issue an alarm.

### Pingmei Increased Prices

It is learned that the Kailuan Mining Bureau has notified the coal industry that it plans to increase the price of Pingmei by 20 yuan per ton. Therefore, the cooked water industry has prepared to file a protest and will appeal to the city Chamber of Commerce and other public organizations to uphold justice. It is hoped that the Kailuan Mining Bureau will consider the difficulties of the people and withdraw the agreement.

### The Shanghai-Ningbo Train Was Again Hit by a Chinese Army Landmine, Destroying Four Cars and Killing More Than Ten Japanese Soldiers, No Casualties Among Passengers Due to the Absence of Passenger Cars

Recently, the Chinese army on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines has become very active, taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese army has been almost completely withdrawn. The Shanghai-Ningbo line is the worst. Since the beginning of this month, there have been three incidents of overturned trains due to landmines. The Japanese army is extremely panicked. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, the track near Qishuyan in Changzhou was again laid with landmines by the Chinese army, causing an uptown train to overturn after hitting the landmine. According to investigations, a row of uptown freight cars drove from Shanghai to Nanjing at 11:00 PM the night before. Around 1:00 AM, when driving near Changzhou, to the east of Qishuyan and the west of Henglin, it hit a landmine planted by the Chinese army. The locomotive and three freight cars were destroyed on the spot, and the rest overturned. The driver and more than ten Japanese soldiers escorting the cars were killed. Fortunately, the train was not attached with passenger cars, so there were no passenger casualties. Traffic on the Shanghai-Ningbo road was interrupted, and the track was destroyed for more than a dozen feet. It has not yet been repaired. Yesterday morning, although the Shanghai-Ningbo train still operated as usual, it only drove to Henglin Station. Passengers had to get off the bus and walk to Qishuyan before changing buses to Ningbo. Passengers all felt apprehensive.

### Goods Transported Inland Along the Yunnan-Burma Road are Loaded onto Ships to Singapore, and Then Transferred to Rangoon for Unloading and Loading onto Trains

The Zi Lin Report said that it was learned from reliable sources that after the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, the first ship from Shanghai to Singapore would arrive at its destination. The second ship, Guonan (transliteration), is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on Thursday. The ship carries thousands of tons of goods manufactured in Shanghai, which will also be transported inland along the Yunnan-Burma Road.

Investigating the Shipping Situation of Goods

According to information from the shipping industry, another ship, Shenguang (transliteration), which was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for Singapore yesterday (the 19th), will be delayed for a few days. It is said that Shanghai transportation companies have sent representatives to Rangoon to investigate the transportation situation, so that goods manufactured in Shanghai can be transported to Sichuan and Yunnan.

Difficulty in Landing in Singapore

Datong News Agency said that passengers traveling from Shanghai to the interior by boat to Singapore need to have a passport, which must be approved by the British Consulate before they can buy a ticket. The procedure for signing the passport to enter Singapore is very complicated. The Consulate must investigate the guarantor of the passport applicant with the Singapore Immigration Bureau before it agrees to sign. It takes more than a month, and the signing fee is one pound and six pence. The procedure for signing a passport to Rangoon is simpler, and only a guarantee from a solid group shop is required. Therefore, for those who travel from Shanghai to Rangoon by boat and do not land in Singapore, the passport signing procedure is still convenient.

### The French Concession Replaces Rickshaw Puller Licenses

From November 4th of this year, the public rickshaw puller licenses will be replaced at the Vehicle Office of the French Police Station at 28 Xuehuali Road. The office hours are from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day except Sunday. Armbands will be issued. License holders can go to replace their licenses according to the following dates. License numbers 1 to 10,000, replacement dates November 4th to 9th, 10,001 to 20,000, November 11th to 16th, 20,001 to 30,000, November 18th to 23rd, 30,001 to 40,000, November 25th to 30th, December 2nd to 7th, is the period for delayed replacements. Those who are overdue will no longer be replaced, and all licenses that have not been replaced before December 7th of this year will be invalidated.

### British Sportsman Hunter Suddenly Dies on the Golf Course, Suddenly Falling to the Ground While Playing Golf, His Companions Rushed to See That He Had Already Died

The Zi Lin Report said that a British sportsman in this city, Hunter, participated in the first day of the Chinese Amateur Golf Championship on the golf course in Sijingqiao yesterday (the 19th). His activities were as usual and there were no signs of illness. At 10:30 AM, when Mr. Hunter and his ball partner Kenmins were playing the fourth round, he suddenly fell to the ground and did not get up. Other participants rushed forward to see and help. Dr. Uhara was also among them. After examining Mr. Hunter, he had already died and there was no way to save him. Therefore, the body was carried into the golf course building, and the flag of the Shanghai Golf Association was lowered to half-mast in mourning. Mr. Hunter came to Shanghai 20 years ago and worked for Deji Foreign Company for many years. Later, he established Hunter Foreign Company, which operated wool goods and was also the deputy agent of the United Motorcycle Insurance Company. Mr. Hunter is survived by his wife and a daughter.

### Five Societies Jointly Discuss the Sutras: On the Precepts of Confucianism and Buddhism; Buddhist Scriptures and Treatises Speak of Four Items

Last week, the Five Societies Jointly Discussed the Sutras held its second lecture. Among the guests were some who had not attended the previous one. The lecturers were Yang Zhongyi and Yao Taiping. Mr. Shen Daling had prepared a topic that was common to all five teachings, but because it was late, there was no time to discuss it. The main points of Mr. Yang's lecture are recorded below:

Six similarities between Confucianism and Buddhism: One of the Paramitas is Shila Paramita. Shila, in Chinese, means "holding precepts," which means being able to uphold the precepts without destroying them. It is the self-governing mind that observes rules and is not tainted by habits. Someone may ask, "Do Buddhists have precepts, and do Confucians also have precepts?" I say, "Yes, it is seen in the Analects 'The gentleman has three cautions' and the History of Yuan, Biography of Lian Xixian, 'Your subject has received the precepts of Confucius.'" Summarizing what the Buddhist scriptures and treatises say, there are four definite items:

The Categories of Precepts Received

The Great Expansive Buddha Repaying Kindness Sutra says, "Precepts have superior, middle, and inferior categories. The Five Precepts are the inferior category, the Ten Precepts are the middle category, and the Complete Precepts are the superior category." The Five Precepts are: not killing, not stealing, not engaging in sexual misconduct, not lying, and not drinking alcohol. "The gentleman keeps away from the kitchen" is the heart of not killing. "Not taking what is unrighteous" is cultivating the heart of not stealing. "Thinking no evil" is cultivating the heart of not engaging in sexual misconduct. "Speaking with trustworthiness" is cultivating the heart of not lying. "Yu banished Yi Di, and Wei Wu made the alcohol prohibition" is cultivating the heart of not drinking alcohol. The Ten Precepts, in addition to the Five Precepts, add not wearing garlands, fine fragrances, or smearing the body with them, which means not wearing extravagant clothes, and those who hold this precept dare not be coquettish. Not singing, dancing, or acting, nor going to watch or listen, which means engaging in wicked and荒亡 (wasteful) acts, and those who hold this precept dare not go on pleasure trips. Not sitting on high, wide, and large beds, which means being disrespectful and lazy, and those who hold this precept dare not be at ease. Not eating at improper times, so as to restrain the desires of the mouth and stomach. Not grasping or treading on gold, silver, or precious objects, so as to cherish the use of wealth. A scholar who is devoted to the Dao but is ashamed of wearing bad clothes and eating bad food is not worth discussing. Confucius did not criticize Yu for wearing coarse clothes and eating poor food. He praised Yu for wearing a worn-out cotton robe without shame. The chapter on "The Village Party" records the Sage's clothing, food, dwelling, and travels in great detail, and it is truly a model for scholars. The Complete Precepts are 250 precepts for monks and 500 precepts for nuns, actually 348 precepts. The Eight Schools Outline says, "When receiving the Complete Precepts, one obtains such boundless precepts, which are as vast as space and encompass the entire Dharma realm, all perfectly complete, hence the name Complete Precepts." Why are there as many as 500 Complete Precepts? It is said that the Five Precepts are not too few, and the Five Hundred Precepts are not too many. Can the word "forgiveness" be practiced for a lifetime? The word "forgiveness" can be practiced for a lifetime without exhausting it, so it is not too few. The three hundred rules of etiquette and the three thousand rules of deportment are not too many.

The Fruits Obtained

The Buddhist Kindness Sutra also says, "Among the Five Precepts, there are also three categories. If one receives the precepts with an inferior mind, one obtains the inferior category of precepts. If one receives the precepts with a middle mind, one obtains the middle category of precepts. If one receives the precepts with a superior mind, one obtains the superior category of precepts. The Ten Precepts and the Complete Precepts also each have three categories, as said of the Five Precepts. If one obtains the Five Precepts with a superior mind, they are the superior category of precepts. If one obtains the Ten Precepts with a middle mind, they are the middle category of precepts. If one obtains the Complete Precepts with an inferior mind, they are the inferior category of precepts. Therefore, depending on the mind, there are superior, middle, and inferior categories, and the precepts obtained are different, without a fixed limit." Receiving precepts in form is not as good as receiving precepts in mind. Receiving precepts in form can be seen and heard. Receiving precepts in mind is seeing in the formless and hearing in the soundless. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "Be cautious of what you do not see, and be fearful of what you do not hear." The Great Learning says, "What ten eyes see and what ten hands point to." "Therefore, the gentleman must be cautious when he is alone." The caution of the Doctrine of the Mean and the Great Learning is receiving precepts in the mind.

The Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says, "Those who uphold precepts in an inferior way are born in the human realm. Those who uphold precepts in a middle way are born in the six desire heavens. Those who uphold precepts and also practice the four dhyanas and the four formless trances are born in the form and formless realms. Those who uphold precepts in a superior way have three types. Those who uphold precepts purely in an inferior way attain Arhatship. Those who uphold precepts purely in a middle way attain Pratyekabuddhahood. Those who uphold precepts purely in a superior way attain Buddhahood." According to this, those who uphold precepts in an inferior way are still reborn in the human realm, and they are fortunate enough not to fall into the three evil paths. Those who uphold precepts in a middle way are born in the six desire heavens, which means escaping the human realm and ascending to heaven. The desire realm has six heavens: (1) the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings, (2) the Heaven of the Thirty-three, (3) the Yama Heaven, (4) the Tushita Heaven, (5) the Nirmanarati Heaven, and (6) the Paranirmita-vasavartin Heaven. Of these six heavens, the Heaven of the Thirty-three and below are called earth-dwelling heavens, and the Tushita Heaven and above are called air-dwelling heavens. If one upholds precepts and also practices the four dhyanas, one escapes the desire realm and is born in the form realm heavens. If one also practices the formless trances, one transcends the form realm and is born in the formless realm heavens, which are divided into four levels: (1) the Plane of Infinite Space, (2) the Plane of Infinite Consciousness, (3) the Plane of No-thingness, and (4) the Plane of Neither Perception nor Non-perception. Those who uphold precepts in a middle way can transcend the human realm but cannot transcend the three realms, so their ultimate attainment lies in upholding precepts in a superior way. Among those who uphold precepts purely in a superior way, those who uphold precepts in an inferior way attain the fourth Arhatship. Those who uphold precepts purely in a middle way attain Pratyekabuddhahood, which is also called a Self-Realized One. Only those who uphold precepts purely in a superior way can attain the ultimate supreme vehicle, the Buddha's path of the Bodhisattva. This is because the categories of precepts received are different, and the fruits obtained are thus different.

The Analects records that Confucius's answers to Yan Yuan, Zhong Gong, Sima Niu, and Fan Chi when they asked about ren (benevolence) were different. It also records that Confucius's answers to Meng Yizi, Meng Wubo, Ziyou, and Zixia when they asked about filial piety were different. When Zigong asked about the qualities of a shi (gentleman), Confucius first told him to act with a sense of shame and to fulfill his mission without disgrace. When asked about the next level, he said, "The clan praises him for being filial, and the village praises him for being fraternal." When asked about the next level, he said, "He is trustworthy in his words and decisive in his actions. He is a stubborn and petty man, but he can still be considered next in line." This is because the categories of precepts received are different, and the fruits obtained are thus superior or inferior. Therefore, Mencius, in his discussion of Le Zhengzi's determining what is beneath the center, says, "What is desirable is called good. Having it within oneself is called trustworthiness. Filling it up is called beauty. Filling it up and having radiance is called greatness. Being great and transforming it is called sageliness. Being sagely and unknowable is called divinity." Although they are all sages, Boyi is the pure sage, Yi Yin is the responsible sage, Liu Xiahui is the harmonious sage, and Confucius is the timely sage.

The Precepts Held

The Brahma Net Sutra, Mind-Ground Chapter, says, "The Buddha told all the Buddha-sons, 'There are ten heavy Pratimokshas. If one receives the Bodhisattva precepts but does not recite these precepts, he is not a Bodhisattva and not a Buddha-seed.'" Pratimoksha in Chinese means liberation, which means liberation in all places or following liberation. The precepts received by the seven assemblies liberate the seven branches of the body and mouth from evil. The seven branches are the three of the body and the four of the mouth, which are the seven branches of karma. It also says, "The Buddha told the Buddha-sons, 'If one commits suicide, teaches others to kill, facilitates killing, praises killing, casually agrees to killing, or even uses spells to kill, causes of killing, conditions of killing, methods of killing, or karma of killing, even all beings with life, one must not intentionally kill them.'" The same applies to stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, harsh speech, and divisive speech, hence the name Ten Heavy Pratimokshas. It also says, "Bodhisattvas should have a compassionate heart to protect and rescue, but if they kill willfully, it is a Parajika offense." Parajika means "severing the head," which means there is no possibility of repentance. Therefore, a Bodhisattva's compassion lies in protecting good people and not shielding evil people. If one breaks the precepts and commits evil to the point of being beyond repentance, even a Bodhisattva cannot forcibly indulge them. This is why one incurs guilt from Heaven and has nowhere to pray. When one incurs guilt to the point of having nowhere to pray, even the sages can do nothing about it but have compassion and not rejoice.

The Items Prohibited

The Sutra of Forty-two Sections Spoken by the Buddha says, "The Buddha said, 'Sentient beings consider ten things to be good and ten things to be evil. What are the ten? The three of the body, the four of the mouth, and the three of the mind. The three of the body are killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. The four of the mouth are divisive speech, harsh speech, lying, and frivolous speech. The three of the mind are jealousy, anger, and delusion. These ten things are not in accordance with the holy path and are called the ten evil deeds. If these evils are stopped, they are each the ten good deeds.'" The Thus Come One's teachings are nothing more than wanting people to turn from evil and do good, holding these precepts of the three karmas of body, mouth, and mind.

The body is the practice of ordinary virtue, the mouth is the caution of ordinary speech, and the mind is introspection without guilt. Speech and action are the pivot of a gentleman. The Great Dai Ritual says, "Speech does not go far away." The body is the master of speech. Action does not go far from the body, which is the root of action. Therefore, the four subjects of virtue, conduct, speech, and language in the sage's gate are valued above politics and literature. This emphasizes that speech and action must be verifiable.

Mr. Yao's lecture on the Classic of Filial Piety covered "The root of the people is exhausted in life, and the meaning of death and life is fully prepared" in great detail, moving the listeners. Then, he spoke of the similarities of the five teachings in the meaning of death and life.

### The Central Trust Bureau Organizes Insurance for Inventory in Stores Against Military Disasters; The Total Amount for Each Store is Limited to 5,000 Yuan; Each Store Must Report Inventory After Business Hours Every Day

After the Central Trust Bureau was ordered to organize military disaster insurance, the military disaster insurance policies issued have reached 86.5 million yuan, of which transportation insurance accounts for 60 million yuan, and the rest are bombing insurance, etc. The insurance premiums charged are lower than any foreign military disaster insurance. The insurance premium does not exceed 1% of the total amount of insurance. Special discounts are also given to long-term insurance and industrial insurance related to construction. Recently, the bureau has handled the method of individual insurance for inventory in business stores during extraordinary times: (1) Stores approved for insurance by the Social Bureau may also insure their inventory at the same time, but the total amount for each store shall not exceed 5,000 yuan. (2) Each store shall fill out three copies of the daily inventory report after business hours. In addition to keeping one copy for their own record, the other two copies shall be delivered to the trade association and the Social Bureau before 8:00 a.m. the next day. (3) The figures filled in the daily inventory report must be consistent with the actual situation and shall not be falsely reported. (4) All books and documents related to the quantity of goods must be properly preserved for verification at any time.

### Various Banks Strive to Shift Fluid Capital Inland; The Exact Number Cannot Be Investigated, But the Results Are Already Evident

Although there is no definite figure to investigate how much fluid capital has flowed into the interior from Shanghai, it is estimated that the total amount of investment in Chongqing and other inland areas by the Shanghai banking community and its customers is no less than 150 million yuan. In the first half of this year, another 100 million yuan flowed into the interior, most of which was remitted by private businesses and individuals to develop enterprises. This point is indeed impressive. The outflow of fluid capital from Shanghai to the interior is generally agreed upon because, on the one hand, it can enable funds to be used properly and develop the southwest, and on the other hand, it can reduce the speculative trend in Shanghai. Shanghai speculators often create trouble in the market, with the exchange market and important stores as their speculative targets, which is very harmful to society. The transfer of Shanghai funds to the interior is the result of the joint efforts of the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, together with various commercial banks. In the future, if the government rewards the successful transfer of funds to the interior, wartime finance and economic construction will naturally become more optimistic.

### Settlement of Un-dispatched Refugees; Arrangement Methods; Continued Care; Shared Responsibility

The Refugee Relief Association issued a public notice yesterday stating that the association has been working with various charitable organizations to carry out relief work for two years. After repeated meetings of the board of directors, all Chinese and foreign directors unanimously decided to divide the refugees in the reception centers into four categories: the elderly, disabled, orphans, women, children, and school-age refugee children, and continue to provide care for them separately. Those who are adults and able to support themselves will be transferred to the dispatch center, and each person will be given funds and dispatched step by step, etc. This proposal was agreed upon unanimously after convening a meeting of various charitable organizations. It is now found that the total number of refugees in the reception centers is still more than 16,000, and the refugees who should continue to receive care account for three-quarters of the total. Four centers, "Elderly, Disabled, Women, Children, Orphans, and Refugee Children," have been established, and the Cilian General Association, the Cilian Branch Association, and this association are responsible for them respectively. They have been handed over to the sub-committee for implementation and adjusted according to the above methods. For the sake of the long-term safety of the refugees who cannot support themselves, the purpose of relief is to be thoroughly implemented. We are sincerely afraid that there are rumors outside that all the reception centers have been disbanded due to a lack of understanding of the truth, so we have truthfully narrated the association's decision-making methods as above to avoid misunderstandings. However, after this, the time for caring for the refugees who remain will be longer, and the cost will be higher. The responsibility of this association and various charitable organizations will be heavier. Although the number of people has decreased, even if we take the item of rice as an example, it has increased more than four times, and a large amount of funding is still needed to maintain it. We deeply hope that all people in Shanghai will continue to support the relief effort with the same spirit as in the past so that the relief work can be carried out from beginning to end. We cannot help but offer our most sincere prayers and hereby issue this public notice.

### Unseasonal Weather; High Fever Epidemic

Since the beginning of autumn in this city, the weather has been cool, and the seasonal epidemics have gradually subsided. However, recently, due to the unseasonal weather, influenza and another type of high fever, one of Shanghai's diseases, are extremely prevalent. Many hospitals in the two concessions have admitted many patients. The health department is now paying attention to it and hopes that residents will take proper precautions.

### Case of Mother and Daughter Eloping; Paramour Accuses of Theft; Old Paramour Steals from Daughter and Paramour Runs Away; Also Sends Letter to Bank Prohibiting Reporting Loss

Yang Haifeng, a native of Shandong who resides at 434 Jiujiang Road and runs the Haifeng Plaster Shop, had a case of his wife and daughter eloping a few days ago. The newspapers have reported on the matter in detail. It is now learned that the mother and daughter are Yang Haifeng's paramour and stepdaughter. Yang began cohabitating with a woman named Zang twelve years ago. At that time, the paramour brought her stepdaughter, Zang Mingfeng, who was only six years old. In the past twelve years, Yang not only treated the paramour

As if she were his wife,

But also regarded the stepdaughter as his own, cherishing her as the apple of his eye. Zang Jinfeng is now twenty-nine years old and has fallen in love with a certain young man. Yang often advised Jinfeng with words to guard against gigolos. However, Jinfeng actually eloped on the morning of the ninth of last month. The woman surnamed Zang, although she had lived with Yang for twelve years, was just a temporary partner. Therefore, while Yang was sound asleep, she took the passbooks, seals, dozens of silk and satin clothes, many gold ornaments, and hundreds of yuan in cash from Yang's deposits in various banks.

All of which were taken away

And eloped tracelessly with her biological daughter, Zang Jinfeng. Yang urgently commissioned lawyer Zhang Danping to file a complaint with the First Court, accusing the paramour and stepdaughter of colluding to steal. The Zang Jinfeng mother and daughter did not appear in court, and they even sent a letter to the Bank of Communications requesting a prohibition on reporting the loss. Yang was even more infuriated that his paramour had stolen his deposits, covered them with seals, and prohibited reporting the loss. Now, the father has commissioned lawyer Zhang to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court to confirm the loss.

### Owner of Underwear Company Flees After Defrauding Goods; Court Discusses Issuing Arrest Warrant

Xue Fengxiang, a local Shanghai resident, is sixty years old and lives at 77 Hengmao Lane, Min Ti Ni Yin Road. Recently, he hired lawyer Fang Junjie to file a complaint with the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court, accusing Mo Baiqing of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. His complaint stated that the defendant is the owner of the Meiguang Underwear Company on Caizhong Road. From the 20th of last month, he went to the Wuzhou Wool Fabric Factory and the Luye Cosmetics Company, which were opened by the plaintiff, to

Purchase towels

One hundred and fifty dozen, worth 885 yuan, and twenty-three dozen of cosmetics worth 221 yuan and 40 cents. The defendant instructed them to be packed in two batches and delivered to Room 24, 3rd Floor, Taian Trading House, Zhubaosan Road. The plaintiff complied and ordered people to deliver the purchased goods to the address that day. After the goods were inspected and accepted by the defendant, he paid with a

Check

From the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, dated September 21, for 900 yuan in national currency. He also said that he was short 140 yuan and asked them to come back the next day to collect the balance. The plaintiff believed him and transferred the check to the Ankang Money Exchange in Xingren Lane, Henan Road, the next day. The money exchange went to the

Bank to cash it, but it was rejected due to insufficient funds. The original check was returned. The plaintiff was shocked and horrified when he heard the news. He immediately went to the defendant's factory to negotiate, but he did not expect to find that the factory had already closed down and the defendant had also

Fled far away

In this situation, the defendant had the intention to defraud goods by fraud. Please, Your Honor, punish him with the crime he deserves. The court, based on the complaint, opened the Second Criminal Division for trial by Judge Tang yesterday morning. The defendant did not appear in court after being summoned. The court immediately ordered the issuance of an arrest warrant and adjourned the hearing indefinitely.

### Peddler of Old Bottles Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping; Two Kidnappers Arrested on the Spot

Shi Tiannai, a native of Huzhou, is thirty-one years old and currently resides on the third floor of the Zhang Dexing Board Box Shop opposite the Dahua Hotel on Zhili Road. He owns a small property in his hometown. After the war broke out and the countryside was occupied, he came to Shanghai with his fellow villager Shen Yilin (fifty-three years old, residing at No. 8, Lane 173, Tangjia Lane, engaged in the used goods business). Shi rented a place to live and made a living by collecting old glass bottles. However, Shen recently learned that Shi had some savings and suddenly had evil intentions. He colluded with his fellow villager Shi Zhangdu (twenty-eight years old, residing at No. 190, Laian Lane, Xinmin Road) and invited a certain foreigner to go to Shi's residence at 7:20 yesterday morning to threaten Shi and drag him to Beijing Road, intending to kidnap him onto a rickshaw. However, at that time, all the rickshaw pullers refused. Shen and Shi then forcibly dragged Shi to the southern end of the Zhabei Bridge on Fujian Road when they were spotted by a Chinese constable from No. 79, who stopped them from proceeding. The foreigner took the opportunity to escape north, while Shen and Shi were arrested and taken to the Zhabei Police Station along with Shi Tiannai for interrogation.

### Owner of Zhengxiang Trading Company Accused of Breach of Trust and Embezzlement; Court Orders Bail and Further Verification

Zhang Xiangqing of Zhengxiang Trading Company, No. 25 Zhubaosan Road, was entrusted by Yu Debao (local Shanghainese, twenty-eight years old) in November of the 27th year to build five residences on Amoy Road and add a small house inside the residence on Gaoteng Road. After the completion in September of the 28th year, Yu discovered that there was a suspicion of forgery and alteration of accounts, so he asked accountant Li Wenjie to check the accounts. It was found that Zhang did have many dishonest points. Yu then commissioned lawyer Lan Xuzhang to file a complaint with the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court, accusing Zhang Xiangqing of breach of trust and forgery. The court, based on the complaint, opened the Second Criminal Division for trial by Judge Li on the afternoon of the 17th. After interrogating the defendant and inquiring in detail about the witness Zou Guozhu, it was confirmed that there was indeed alteration of accounts and other circumstances. He was ordered to post bail of 1,000 yuan and reschedule the trial.

### Abolition of Transit Tax on Eggs and Vegetables

Since prices have soared, the lives of the poor have become increasingly difficult. It is now learned that the Customs has abolished the land transit tax on fresh eggs and vegetables from the 15th of this month. From now on, the prices of eggs and vegetables are expected to drop.

### Improved Treatment for Paint Workers Resolved; Labor and Management Agreed on Methods; Implementation on November 11

There are about four or five thousand paint workers in this city. Recently, due to the increasing cost of living, the union representatives have requested the employers to increase wages and food allowances to maintain their livelihoods. On the 28th of last month, representatives of the paint workers' union and the trade association conducted negotiations on the sixth floor of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association. The employers also expressed sympathy for the workers' difficult lives at this time. After two meetings, representatives of both sides agreed on the afternoon of the 19th to increase the wage by 50 cents per worker, that is, the wage per worker is 1 yuan and 25 cents, and the food allowance per worker is 1 yuan and 25 cents, for a total of 2 yuan and 50 cents per worker. The opinions of both sides were harmonious, and a satisfactory solution has been reached. It is scheduled to be implemented on November 11.

### News from the Publishing Industry

Since the "Children's News" was first published during the National Day holiday, subscriptions from schools in this city have been very enthusiastic, and the sales volume has increased sharply. The second issue will be published on Tuesday, the 21st. The content is even more substantial. Each copy is still sold for 5 cents in national currency. In addition to the sales points in various schools, all newspaper stands in the city also sell it.

The 19th issue of the Shanghai Monthly, Volume 2, has been published. There are many rumors about the issue of the Soviet-Japanese treaty. Li Bian's article "A Brief Discussion on Soviet-Japanese Relations" provides a concise analysis.

The "Human World Monthly" aims to describe various forms of the human world, translating, creating, compiling, and editing. The eleventh issue has now been published, including picture periodicals, international anecdotes, modern trends, battlefield communications, tactical trivia, character scenery, and essays.

### Strict Alert by Japanese Soldiers in West Shanghai; Tense Situation; Increased Posts, Arrangement of Barbed Wire; Mobile Searches of Pedestrians and Vehicles

Since Warrant Officer Sato Seiichi of the Japanese military police platoon in West Shanghai was shot and killed near Qianjia Lane, Pingyuan Road on the afternoon of the 18th, the Japanese soldiers have immediately implemented emergency alert measures in the vicinity, and the situation is tense. According to a reporter from Daguan News Agency who drove to inspect yesterday, armed Japanese military police and "municipal police" patrolled back and forth on foot or by motorcycle on the sections of the outer boundary roads Yuyuan Road, Jessfield Road, and Connaught Road, frequently throughout the day. There were also five or six Japanese officers and soldiers taking turns checking pedestrians and vehicles at the corner of Dibang Road and Eddington Road, Jessfield Road, and Kangjiaqiao. The No. 1 Road bus and the No. 20 tram passing through the area were also stopped several times. The Japanese military police headquarters on Jessfield Road, the Benham Road detachment, and the gate of the Xihu Police Station at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII were all heavily guarded by armed sentries and placed with barbed wire obstacles. All vehicles and pedestrians deemed suspicious were forced to stop and subjected to harsh inspections.

### French Company Water and Electricity Workers' Strike; No Negotiations Yesterday; Both Sides Will Continue to Negotiate; Restore Traffic at Any Time

Since the French Tram Company went on strike on the 25th of last month, more than 20 days have passed. Initially, with the efforts and cooperation of the French authorities and the company, necessary traffic was still maintained as usual. Later, due to the addition of coppersmith workers to the strike, all traffic was completely suspended. However, since labor and management have held direct negotiations in the past few days, there is hope for a resumption of work. On the mornings and afternoons of the previous day, the company's manager, Favreau, and eight worker representatives, including four representatives from the vehicle department and a representative from the mechanical department, held two long direct negotiations. There are no longer any problems with increasing wages. The only thing that has not been settled is that the workers insist that all 45 dismissed workers must be reinstated. It is rumored that negotiations will continue yesterday morning, but this is not accurate. However, the negotiations between the two sides have not broken down and will continue to conduct direct negotiations to seek a solution. However, the time for the next negotiation has not been agreed upon. The company can wait for the worker representatives to come to negotiate at any time. As for the company's preparations for restoring traffic, they are making preparations every day.

### Swindling Jewelry and Ornaments; Japanese Swindler Caught; Many Cases; Finally Arrested by Police

The Shanghai Times reported that for the past few weeks, a Japanese man in the central district of the Public Concession has repeatedly defrauded jewelry and fled without a trace. The Shanghai Municipal Police has been searching for the suspect vigorously. Just after noon yesterday (the 19th), the Japanese man went to the Huamao Jewelry Store on Jiangxi Road again to carry out his old tricks and was finally arrested by detectives from the Central Police Station. The method used by the suspect to swindle jewelry and other items is much the same. The targets of the swindle are mostly Chinese jewelry stores. He claims to represent a large Japanese trading company on the Bund and wants to purchase jewelry on behalf of the principal. The jewelry store owners do not suspect anything and take out exquisite ornaments for him to choose from. The Japanese man selects several items and asks the store owner to order someone to go to the office on the Bund to collect the money. After arriving at the office, the Japanese man asks the person collecting the money to wait outside while he goes to get the money. In reality, he takes the ornaments and seizes the opportunity to escape. For the past few weeks, the suspect has defrauded jewelry and ornaments worth no less than several thousand yuan. After receiving the report, the police dispatched detectives everywhere. Yesterday, when the suspect went to the Huamao Jewelry Store to try his old tricks, he was caught by the detectives who were tracking him. It is believed that the Japanese man previously committed many crimes in Hongkou before coming to the central district to swindle jewelry. He has finally been caught.

### Yan Liu Shi Comes to Shanghai from Peiping to Accuse Son-in-Law of Obstructing Morality; Ma Ziren Guilty of Adultery and Intimidation of Younger Sister-in-Law, Already Convicted, Case Re-Opened for Further Inquiry

Ma Ziren, a graduate of Northeast University from Peiping, was instructed by his mother-in-law, Yan Liu Shi, two years ago in winter, to take travel expenses of seven hundred yuan and accompany her younger daughter Yan Jing (also known as Jingbo, 20 years old this year) to Kunming for studies. Unexpectedly, when Ma and Jing passed through Shanghai from their hometown, he raped Jingbo in the Hui Jin Hotel on Sanma Road. When the travel expenses ran out, Ma forced the girl to the

Great Eastern Ballroom

to work as a dance hostess.

Before long, Jingbo met a dancer from Ningbo, Chen Dingming (43 years old, residing at No. 25, Lane 42, Bei Di Aolong Road, employed at Leli Foreign Firm, No. 91 Beijing Road). A relationship developed from friendship. Chen then told the girl to quit dancing and they lived together at Chen's house. Ma also went along, but Ma secretly strongly opposed this matter. Chen paid 300 yuan and told Ma to leave Chen's house. Ma held a grudge and threatened Chen and Yan with a kitchen knife. Chen had no choice but to report to the police and have Ma detained and sent to the Second Branch of the Court, according to the

obstructing freedom

crime, sentenced to nine months in prison. Recently, Yan's mother, Yan Liu Shi (Ma Ziren's mother-in-law), came to Shanghai and, in her capacity as a legal representative, commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court Criminal Division, accusing Ma of obstructing morality. The court approved the lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Jiang issued an official letter to the authorities of the Second Special Prison, stating the cause of the case, and brought Ma Ziren up for trial. According to the plaintiff Yan Liu Shi's

Confession

Last winter, my daughter Jingbo's uncle sent a letter from Chongqing, instructing Jingbo to study in Chongqing. At that time, my eldest son-in-law (referring to the defendant Ma Ziren) voluntarily requested me and was willing to accompany my younger daughter to Chongqing, and swore to heaven that he had no ulterior motives. I thought he was my son-in-law and did not suspect anything else. I immediately raised 700 yuan for travel expenses and handed them to the defendant to accompany my daughter south. Who knew he was actually

A beast in human form

two-faced, destroyed my younger daughter's chastity, and forced her to work as a dance hostess. Therefore, I request the court to sentence the defendant to the punishment he deserves, etc. The court then cross-examined the defendant Ma Ziren, who confessed that because the plaintiff's eldest daughter did not abide by the way of women and ruined my reputation, I deliberately raped my younger sister-in-law in order to ruin the reputation of her Yan family ancestors. Judge Jiang examined the situation and ordered the defendant to be detained and await another hearing at a later date.

### Precautionary Measures in Both Concessions Continue

According to the report of the Public Concession Police Department, since the precautionary measures were taken in the territory on August 9, the security achievements have improved day by day. The number of criminal cases occurring within the boundaries in the past week has been reduced to 417. As for the ordinary precautionary facilities within the boundaries, the authorities have not considered removing them at present, as they have been quite effective in maintaining security, and public transportation has not been hindered in any way. The French Concession has also continued to extend the measures indefinitely.

### After the Consecration of the Panchen Lama Statue, the Grandeur of the Thousand Lamps Ceremony; The Footprints of Esoteric Buddhist Images in Jiangnan Begin with the Panchen Lama Master

The Panchen Lama statue consecrated in Jueyuan was cast solely by Rongzeng Kanbu. Its cost reached 30,000 gold due to the high price of copper. It is noted that before the war, the Shanghai Buddhist community cast a copper bell weighing 10,000 jin at Jiuhua Mountain, named Youming Bell, and hung it on the mountain. The casting of this Panchen Lama statue is a major event in the Buddhist community that shines before and after.

Ascending the Platform to Preach

Since the consecration of the Panchen Lama statue the day before yesterday, the Dharma Assembly was held as usual yesterday. Rongzeng Kanbu presided over the altar and preached, with ten lamps set up inside the altar, shining like stars. Buddhist celebrities Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Zhao Yunshao, Shen Binhan, Zhao Puchu, etc., all personally attended the altar to take care of the ceremony. Hundreds of Buddhist men and women listened to Rongzeng's preaching. The altar was packed.

This Thousand Lamps Offering Dharma Assembly must be held continuously for ten days before the altar is removed. The Panchen Lama statue will be temporarily placed in Jueyuan, and then sent to Putuo Mountain in the future when the situation is peaceful, to build temples for worship. The footprints of esoteric Buddhist images in southern China begin with the Panchen Lama statue, which is a unique highlight in the history of Jiangnan Buddhism.

### Registration of Trademarks for Domestic Goods; No More Delays or Evasions

Previously, in order to prevent privately produced goods from changing their appearance, being sold in the interior, and disrupting the wartime financial foundation, there were strict measures for the registration and certification of goods from various countries. However, over time, the regulations have been played with. A relevant authority has submitted a petition to the Ministry of Economy, suggesting that trademarks for all domestic goods must be registered with the Ministry of Economy. The Ministry of Economy has replied to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that merchants have the freedom and sovereignty to register trademarks for goods and cannot be forced to do so. However, for the sake of their own interests and business reputation, merchants will also be happy to register and will never want to bring trouble on themselves. It is hoped that all domestic goods organizations will be notified to instruct their employees, factories, and shops to voluntarily register with the Ministry of Economy, no longer delay the registration of trademarks, eliminate the flow of privately produced goods into the interior, and strengthen the wartime economic foundation.

### Machine-Made Noodles; Revised Price; Thirty-Six Cents Per Jin; Implemented from Tomorrow

All members of the Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association have been repeatedly subjected to panic over flour. They have been operating reluctantly with the efforts of the concession authorities to mediate. This time, they have resumed negotiations with the flour mills and agreed to supply 2,030 bags per day at a limited price of 16.5 yuan per bag, plus a handling fee of 0.3 yuan. Compared with the current market price of cut noodles, the losses are quite large. Therefore, with the consent of the concession authorities, from the 22nd of this month, the retail price of cut noodles will be changed to 36 cents per jin. All businesses must not exceed the limit.

### Hunan Provincial Government Holds Educational Symposium; Discussing Production in Various Schools; Producing to Achieve Self-Sufficiency

(Laiyang Correspondent) Chairman Xue (Yue) of the Hunan Provincial Government attaches great importance to school education. All public and private schools in the province should be thoroughly inspected. Those with outstanding achievements will be rewarded, and those with poor management and poor performance will be punished or banned depending on the severity of the circumstances. Secretary-General Li (Yangjing) followed the discussion and conducted a thorough investigation. On the afternoon of September 24, he sent letters to Speaker Zhao of the Provisional Council, Deputy Speaker Chen, and heads of various agencies, inviting them to attend the Educational Symposium in the Provincial Government Auditorium to discuss matters related to the rectification of private secondary schools. A total of more than ten people attended, including Secretary Li (Yangjing) of the Provincial Government, Speaker Zhao (Hengti) and Deputy Speaker Chen (Runlin) of the Provisional Council, Secretary Xiang (Yujie) of the Council, as well as council members Chang (Bucheng) and Fang (Zhenggang), Secretary-General Liao (Weifan) and Committee Members Chen (Diguang), He (Chuqiang), and Xiao (Xun) of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Committee Members Tan (Yiru) and Wang (Guanghai) of the Provincial Government, and the heads of various departments, Deputy Commander Liao (Mingou), Acting Chief Committee Member Qiu (Ao), Li Zhongren, Shusen), Accounting Director Zhou (Sen), Director Yong (Jiayuan), and Manager Qiu (Guowei).

The government had not enforced the regulations to order them to close down. He hoped that everyone would provide guidance on this difficult situation so that a satisfactory solution could be obtained. Then, various proposals were discussed. First, regarding unapproved private secondary schools, the Hunan Province's regulations on banning unapproved private secondary schools have been promulgated, but there are many difficulties in enforcement. How should this be resolved? Second, regarding approved private secondary schools, (1) Is the draft plan for assessing the subsidy standards for each school appropriate? (2) Implement a production movement in each school so that they can be self-sufficient. The period for receiving school subsidies is proposed to be limited to a maximum of ten years from the 30th year of the Republic. The progress of production in each school should be reported to the department for record. Is this approved? (3) How should the location of approved private secondary schools be distributed in the future? Acting Chief Committee Member Qiu (Ao), Secretary-General Liao (Weifan), Committee Members Chen (Diguang), He (Chuqiang), and Fang (Zhenggang) all expressed important opinions on the above two conditions. Except for the first item, they all unanimously advocated that the government should conduct a thorough investigation, grant a generous time limit, and strictly follow the official orders. For the first item of the second case, the participants will submit their written opinions to the Education Department within one week for further processing. The second and third items were also discussed and satisfactory resolutions were reached. The meeting resulted in a very satisfactory outcome.

### Cold Outcome in Western League First Division Soccer; Portugal Unexpectedly Loses to Western Patrol; Results in a Miserable 5-4 Defeat by One Goal; Portuguese Trailed 4-1 in the First Half

In the Western League First Division soccer match, Portugal and Western Patrol met at Yiyuan yesterday, resulting in an unexpected cold outcome where Portugal was defeated by Western Patrol with a score of 5-4. Western Patrol took the lead with a score of 4-1 in the first half, leaving Portugal helpless. Despite their efforts to attack in the second half, they still lost by one goal. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Western Patrol

Hutelai Weiketai

Lueliezitefei Jibosheng

Que Lunzifu Fangsaiga Feihuate Beida Shitengqie

Portugal

Western Patrol's Victory

Western Patrol's mid-line was exceptionally good yesterday, causing the Portuguese to retreat in fear, which was one of the key factors for their victory. With the help of the former St. Francis star Shitengqie and the sprinting star Fangxuejia, they were majestic and made the Portuguese merchants bow their heads. When the score was 3-5, the Portuguese merchants chased to 4-5, with only one goal difference, the Portuguese merchants' offensive was unstoppable. Unfortunately, they failed in the end.

Policeman's Majesty

In addition to the two heroes Shitengqie and Fangxuejia, the rest of the Western Patrol team are all veterans. Goalkeeper Bo'erbin was a member of the B team last year, but he is also quite skilled. After the two teams were ready in the morning, the police took a flanking offensive and raided the Portuguese merchants' position. The Portuguese merchants are all veterans, but the front line lacks the Luo Chailiao brothers and the central defender lacks Xue Erfo, so their movements were hindered. In addition, they have been away from the battlefield for a long time. Once they entered the arena, the Portuguese merchants' inner room had been searched once by Santou Bao, and one city was confiscated. Before long, Shitengqie, a former member of St. Francis who had just donned the tiger skin, performed a "hat trick," scoring three goals in a row, causing the Portuguese merchants to lose four times. The morale of the army was shaken, and the audience was also stunned. After a long time, the Portuguese merchants finally hit Bo'erbin once in a difficult resistance, and the first half ended with a score of 4-1.

A Pity to Lose

After eating the lemons, the fire continued. Shitengqie was particularly energetic and added another arrow to the Portuguese merchants in an instant. Although the Portuguese were hit once by Leimidi, they still lacked vitality, and the police veterans' arrogance was still fierce. But a strange peak suddenly rose, and after Fafanfan broke through the center, Gain hit the red heart again. Thus, from an absolute downward trend of 0-4, they closely chased to a close situation of 4-5, and a glimmer of light had been revealed for the future, and hope was even stronger. The Portuguese soldiers were a hundred times more courageous, and launched a melee battle in the last ten minutes. Unfortunately, the Portuguese merchants were unlucky. When Fafanxiao succeeded and tied the score at 5-5, the judge Wu Shouheng judged it as offside and invalidated it. All the hopes were suddenly wiped out. One minute later, the final whistle blew, and the Portuguese merchants were finally defeated by Western Patrol with a score of 4-5.

### Qibu Table Tennis Association Launches Table Tennis Hard Ball Competition; Chen Linsheng Donates a Large Silver Cup; Meeting to Discuss Matters at Da Sanxing Today

Since table tennis in Shanghai has been enthusiastically promoted by all sectors of society, it has sprung up like mushrooms. However, table tennis balls are divided into two types: soft and hard. European and American countries use hard balls, while China adheres to the old rules and still uses soft balls. However, in order to seek progress in technology and step onto the world table tennis stage, it is necessary to quickly reform and practice hard balls more. It is learned that Chen Linsheng, chairman of the Qibu Table Tennis Association, has spared no effort in promoting hard balls and has repeatedly launched appeals over the years, requesting all sectors of society to promote them. However, due to a lack of response, it has been delayed until now, making it difficult for China's table tennis level to reach its peak. Mr. Chen is now donating a large silver cup in order to improve table tennis standards, promote international glory, and cultivate talents, to hold a hard ball table tennis individual championship to promote it. However, due to limited capacity, participants are temporarily limited to members. If the trial run achieves excellent results, a full Shanghai public group league will be launched. The association is scheduled to hold a staff meeting at 2:00 pm today (the 21st) on the third floor of the Da Sanxing Restaurant to discuss all the proceedings of the cup competition and to determine the opening date and competition rules. According to the table tennis cup competitions launched by all sectors of society in Shanghai for more than ten years, none have been held with hard balls. The association has taken this into consideration and has taken the lead in launching it. Its contribution to the table tennis community is very great. It is expected that various groups will promote it one after another in the future. Not only will China's table tennis level be improved from now on, but also, if we plan ahead, we will be able to compete on the world stage and definitely promote and earn international glory. The following members are requested to attend on time:

Chen Linsheng, Chuan Guiqing, Cheng Shuming, Mao Yong, Yang Kaiyun, Hu Yiping, Feng Chanchu, Weng Zhichao, Fan Hanqing, Xiao Fei, Hu Zhongfa, Cheng Zhichun, Jiang Zongdi, Xu Junyan, Xia Guisheng.

### Dismissal. Theft. Rewards for Arrest, etc. Yu Huo

Yesterday, a familiar classmate from my hometown rushed to my place early in the morning, his face showing rare panic. I hurriedly asked him what trouble he was in.

"I'm unemployed too!" This was his mournful voice.

I was stunned and confused. Because as far as I knew, he was not only a cautious and lovable young man, but also a diligent and upright clerk in the sock factory where he worked, and had always been trusted by his manager. This sudden announcement of unemployment was bound to make people wonder!

According to his account, I learned that the reason for his dismissal for being considered irregular was that the manager said he was "not dedicated to his work!" The so-called "not dedicated" was because my classmate, taking advantage of his social activities, took on some business outside of his duties—selling small pieces of clothing. Unfortunately, one day a friend ran into his shop and loudly contacted him about that transaction, which was discovered by the manager. That evening, he was called to the manager's room and, under questioning, my classmate honestly admitted it. Thereupon, the manager immediately issued his order:

"Oh, in that case, please seek employment elsewhere!..."

He felt unable to laugh or cry. Yesterday, he had to leave the shop with his bedding on his shoulder. Although he only had his own burden, his job was, after all, the source of his livelihood today. Therefore, he looked distressed and asked me to find him a place to eat.

I felt inexplicably uneasy! Although I looked at his personal experience, I couldn't help but shed tears of sympathy for him, but because of my humble position and lack of influence, I only had the intention but couldn't find a way to help.

However, the sudden dismissal of my classmate made me recall the incident a few days ago, reported in the local news section of this newspaper, about the four employees of Sincere Company who were arrested and executed for theft. At the same time, the advertisements "Reward for the Arrest of Fugitive Partner ×××" that can be found from time to time in the advertisement section, like these cases and the situation encountered by my classmate, although they are two different things, the hardships in the lives of industrial and commercial workers during this period have more or less some common ground.

Since the surge in prices in this isolated city has become increasingly fierce, thousands of industrial and commercial workers, living in a state of expensive rice and firewood, are mostly facing their line of starvation and cold. Under the desire for "survival," who doesn't try to find other profitable "outlets" besides their existing low-paying jobs? Therefore, my classmate's additional side business was really not an unexpected attempt, and it did not have a great impact on his work, because his diversified activities were entirely done in his spare time. How could it be considered a crime of "not being dedicated to his work"? At the same time, some, unable to "find a way out" and unable to make a living, and with weak wills, have created the tragedy of suicide. Those with a strong desire to live, either abuse their power for personal gain or commit various acts of theft and embezzlement of public funds and property. Can we say that this is a personal crime, a shameless scum? (Of course, there are also some who steal to compensate for their infatuation with theaters and dance halls, but they are not the majority.)

This is a social disease. As long as one is not oblivious to reality, everyone can see the threat of death that the demons (including speculators who hoard and manipulate) around this isolated city are imposing on the people of the city, creating countless pain and sin!

In this great era, I have always believed in the importance of unity between the upper and lower classes, neighbors and relatives. Only mutual harmony can prevent us from being taken advantage of by the demons of the times and seek common safety to tide over this difficult stage. From my classmate's unemployment and some social news such as "reward for arrest" and "suicide by poison," I sincerely hope that the authorities in the industrial and commercial sectors can show more understanding and help for the living conditions of workers, directly relieve the suffering of colleagues, and indirectly reduce the occurrence of crime in society.

### On "Dengue Fever" Ke Deqiong

"Dengue" is the internationally used name for this disease. The word "dengue" is not a personal name, but means "decoration" in Spanish, probably referring to the red rash that covers the whole body. In English, it is also called Dendy Fever, meaning "dandy fever," probably because those who suffer from it mostly have flushed faces, like richly decorated dandies. It is also called breakbone fever, because the limbs and bones are so painful that it feels like a fracture. Our country used to call it "gan zheng," which means "sore pain," also named for its characteristic of soreness and pain.

This disease is mostly prevalent in autumn and summer, in low-lying areas near rivers and seas, and is rare in highlands, so it has a close relationship with mosquitoes. The speed and scope of the spread of this disease are the giants of various infectious diseases, and no other disease can surpass its high infection rate. It was first discovered in Egypt and Java in 1779. In 1872, Xiamen, Fujian, and in 1902, Shantou and Chaozhou, Guangdong, there were severe epidemics, with up to 80% of residents being infected. The current epidemic originated in the Songjiang area. In July and August, nine out of ten people in Songjiang were ill. At that time, some thought it was paratyphoid, and some thought it was the flu. In the past month, Shanghai has also been affected and is spreading rapidly. Shanghai has an extremely dense population. Although there are fewer mosquitoes than in the interior, bedbugs are everywhere and suck human blood, so they may also be a medium for transmission. According to the infection rate of previous years, the number of victims will reach at least one million, which is truly alarming. Fortunately, although there is no specific treatment for this disease, nor is there any way to prevent it, it is rarely dangerous if it goes well, and the epidemic period is not long, at most two months, so it will soon disappear on its own.

### Mass Obligatory Night School

### Speaking of Eating Crabs Bo Wenyan

"This year's crabs are really expensive, and it's a small year!" I've heard this lament more than once.

For the rich, rice, which is even more expensive than crabs, is piled up in warehouses in thousands of bags. A few dollars for a crab might not even be enough to whet their appetites. Those who are poor and squeezed in line to buy cheap rice probably won't have the mood to compose poems in front of the crab stalls, right? So, what does "really expensive" and "small year" have to do with it?

But I have heard this lament more than once.

Who is lamenting?

Expensive rice and firewood seem to have already bent their backs, but those with a "love of good food," such as seasonal delicacies like crabs, still have the desire to "try" them, so they feel it's too expensive; and, it's a small year!

Merely lamenting, of course, is bound to be a bit "mouthwatering." After looking at the rice in the rice jar, they still choose to buy a few smaller ones. Only after eating them do they feel like they've fulfilled their responsibility as a person; however, they might still reluctantly add, "In previous years, you could buy a bunch of crabs like this for one dollar!" Then, they calculate how many dollars this feast cost in total, and then convert it into how many liters of rice could be bought with that amount. At this time, they can't help but lament again; this lament is the sorrow of lamenting one's lack of money.

There are not a few people like this. Eating crabs is like this, how can other things be any different!

### The Hawthorne Case: The Dancer's Fate Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 9 Amazing News

I couldn't help but be surprised to see him like this. "What? Tell me. What did you remember?"

Old Mao stammered, "These—these leather shoes—belong to Manager Lu. He gave them to me when they were old."

I thought to myself, if Old Mao's explanation is not false, it can indeed dispel a suspicion. Otherwise, it would be too coincidental that the nail print on the floor is the same as the shoes of both Lu Jiansheng and Old Mao. I asked, "Oh, Manager Lu gave you these leather shoes? When did he give them to you?"

Old Mao thought for a moment and replied, "That was still at the end of last year—Sir, you don't have to be suspicious, this isn't fake. Manager Lu didn't give me these leather shoes directly, Miss Wang gave them to me. Jinmei saw it when she gave it to me, you can ask her—Sir, I think—" He paused again.

I urged, "Why don't you say it? What do you think?"

Old Mao licked his lips and replied, "I think since the footprint on the floor is the same size as these leather shoes, maybe Manager Lu went in last night."

I lowered my head and thought for a moment, not answering, and asked again, "You really didn't go in last night?"

Old Mao looked straight at my face and said confidently, "I really didn't. There's not a word of falsehood in what I'm saying, I can swear to it."

I felt that his words seemed true and not false. For a moment, I couldn't think of any other questions that could prove it, so I nodded and said, "Okay, is Jinmei inside now? I want to talk to her."

Old Mao replied, "She's upstairs, I'll go call her." He turned around and walked out of the guardhouse, stood on the steps again, turned his head, "Should I call her here?"

I shook my head and said, "To the drawing-room."

Old Mao walked down the cement steps, passed through the short privet hedge, and walked along the already dry cement path towards the main house. I stood in the guardhouse for a while and looked around the small room. In addition to a wooden-framed bed, a small square table, and two Western-style straight-backed chairs, there was also a wicker box under the bed. (142)

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Edison Special Issue

### A Brief Biography of Edison

The American humorist Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: "The true measure of cultural progress is not in the census, nor in the size of cities, nor in the harvest in the fields, but in the talents produced by the country." This is true, so everything about Edison is what every American considers to be a source of pride.

Edison can represent a typical American. He has a sense of humor, he loves his family, he has patience and courage, and he is kind and humane. He is basically the same as anyone on the street. He always thinks of others and rarely considers himself. Therefore, Will Rogers said that even if Edison had not invented anything, he would still be great.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Edison's invention of motion pictures, Hollywood's MGM Pictures has made his life into two films, "Young Edison" and "The Great Edison."

October 21st is the anniversary of his invention of the electric light bulb. This newspaper is publishing a special issue to express our utmost admiration for him. At the same time, the list of winners of the primary school students' summer homework competition, which was originally scheduled to be announced yesterday by this newspaper, will be announced in today's special issue. We hope that the children will learn from him, imitate him, and be as great as him in the future. Then the publication of this special issue will be even more meaningful. —Editor's Note

Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, USA, on February 11, 1847. His ancestors were Dutch. His grandfather was a royalist, so after the revolution, he was exiled to Canada. His father was a revolutionary, so he moved from Canada to the United States. His mother was a teacher, originally from Scotland and a combination of the Quaker religion. His family was not well-off in his childhood, but his nature of diligent study was revealed very early on. For example, seeing geese sitting on eggs and hatching goslings after a long time, he would sit on chicken eggs, hoping to hatch chicks.

He went to school, but the teacher thought he was foolish, so he only attended school for three months before being sent home. At the age of eleven, he began to experiment with various chemicals in a small house at home. He had twenty large bottles, all labeled "Poisonous" to prevent family members from playing with them. He also bought other chemicals from pharmacies in the countryside and mixed them himself. This asset gradually increased, and by the age of fifteen, he already had many important books on chemistry and physics.

At that time, his family moved to Port Huron. He sold candy and newspapers on the train, and used the extra money to buy chemicals and experiment in the baggage car, and published a weekly newspaper. But unfortunately, one day the phosphorus powder spilled and immediately caught fire. The conductor immediately put it out with water, but the conductor's anger did not subside. When the train stopped, he expelled him and severely hit his ear, making him deaf. His printing press and chemicals were scattered all over the ground, causing him to cry bitterly.

He collected the chemicals and printing press and published a small newspaper, commenting on the people of the town, which aroused public anger, and he was thrown into the small river. The small newspaper was forced to cease publication.

At that time, he had a strong desire to read, but he had no opportunity to attend school, so he had to read in the library in his spare time, and he gained a rough understanding of various sciences.

When he was selling newspapers on the train, the stationmaster's son was in distress one day. Fortunately, he rescued him. The stationmaster was very grateful, so he taught him telegraphy. Four months later, he had practiced very well, so he joined the railway service.

In 1868, he went to Boston and joined Western Union Telegraph Company. He was one of the fastest telegraphers there. At the same time, he invented the election recording machine there. At that time, he was only twenty-one years old. In 1869, he went to New York, and in 1870, he made a stock ticker, which he got a reward of four yuan for. In 1873, he married Miss Mary Stilwell.

He used that income to build a laboratory, which he later moved to Menlo Park in 1876.

With the joint efforts of many comrades, after many failures, and numerous times of approaching the number two-five-five.

In 1884, Miss Mary Stilwell passed away. In 1886, he remarried Miss Nina Miller. On October 18, 1931, this great scientist passed away, but the happiness he gave to people will always be praised by mankind.

There are many things in Edison's life that are worthy of young people to emulate. The first is his spirit of hard work. When he invented the electric light, he invented the electric light bulb on October 11, 1879. This was his greatest invention in his life. He has patented a total of one thousand one hundred and fifty inventions.

On December 21, 1879, the New York Herald published a full page of news detailing his invention of the light bulb, and a public trial was held on Christmas of that year. More than 3,000 people visited.

In 1880, he founded a power plant, which was established in New York's Pearl Street. Even for the filament alone, he tested it 9,000 times before succeeding.

He often worked day and night, without sufficient rest time. When he first arrived in New York, he really didn't have the money to rent a house, so he rested in the factory for four hours. Because he worked sixteen hours a day, his life was actually twice as long as others. He once said that time is the most precious thing in the world because it cannot be bought with money.

He worked hard throughout his life to invent, but the things he invented were all needed by mankind. He was unwilling to invent anything that mankind did not need.

He worked hard and didn't care about his clothing. He spent all his money on books and equipment. He never went to hotels to waste his time.

He had a habit of taking notes at any time. All his books were full of annotations. Books were his best companion. Once, when he invented something, he studied it for six weeks, eating and sleeping at the workplace, and did 2,000 trials before succeeding.

### A Summary of the Evolution of Electric Light Bulbs

· Edison invented the electric light bulb.

· Dr. Coolidge invented the tungsten filament vacuum bulb.

· Dr. Langmuir invented the argon gas bulb.

· Mr. Peake invented the frosted bulb.

· The latest modern coiled filament bulb.

Several people in the world have worked hard to invent the electric light bulb. Before Edison's invention, several British people also had the same intentions, but they did not succeed.

After Edison installed the stock ticker in New York, he received a reward of 40,000 yuan. He used this money to build a laboratory. With the joint efforts of many comrades, he invented many things.

He thought that the arc lamp that was used at that time needed to be transformed, so he was determined to invent the electric light. He wanted to use electric current to heat a certain object without breaking it, because heat and light cannot be separated. The higher the temperature, the greater the light. According to the records in many books, he decided to use carbon first. Although it can burn in the air, it will eventually burn out, so the air must be removed.

He put a paper strip in a glass bottle, and it burned out after eight minutes. Carbon seemed unreliable, but after trying other metals such as platinum alloy, he still used carbon, but after the current passed, the carbon tended to melt. His exhaust fan was not sophisticated, so the light bulbs he made could only burn for fifteen minutes at most.

In 1879, he got a perfect exhaust fan that could remove all the air, so he used carbon again. At that time, he first made an object like a hair from ordinary cotton thread, then put it in the stove to burn, and then put it in a nickel model and put it into a glass bulb. On the evening of October 21, 1879, the first light bulb was successfully created and continued to burn for forty hours.

Edison once said: We sat and watched the electric light continue to burn. The longer it burned, the more surprised and happy we were.

However, the light bulbs made at that time were not ideal, so they have been improved many times. Because the first electric light bulb was created by Edison, Edison is the ancestor of modern light bulbs.

After his first invention, he and engineers from various countries continued to improve them. In 1905, German Dr. Aner Von Wklsb

### Edison's Weekly Newspaper

When Edison went to the train to work as a newspaper and candy vendor, in addition to sending part of the money he earned back home, he successively added his property to the baggage car. Once he bought a hand-cranked printing press and published a weekly newspaper Weekly Herald. Using his experience in telegraphy, he also inquired about news from the telegraph offices at each station, so the news he published was the latest.

Although Edison was only fifteen years old when he ran the newspaper, he was very amazing in terms of management methods. He understood the true meaning of journalism, and he also understood the proper way to run a newspaper.

In that weekly newspaper, there was the following announcement:

"To the managers of the Grand Trunk Line: Please give the subscription form to the newsboy T. Edison at the Drew Combined Station. We will be very grateful. Please attach the newspaper fee of eight cents per month, absolutely paid in advance."

In that weekly newspaper, it was divided into several columns. Each column has its own characteristics. In the "Hope" column, the following passage was published: According to the recently announced law, all the pubs in Port Huron are restricted to opening until this Sunday. This kind of move is really necessary, because this kind of pub is really disgusting.

From the newspaper he edited, interviewed, published, and distributed, it can also be seen that he had a talent for poetry, because he often published several poems.

Although the size of his newspaper was not large, the content can be said to be all-encompassing. International news was also given considerable importance, so in one issue, there was a piece of news saying: According to news from Paris, the Chinese emperor will send a special ambassador to be permanently stationed in Britain and France.

The "Prices" column can also be said to be one of the characteristics of the weekly newspaper. From this column, we can see that the prices at that time were:

Eggs 12 cents per dozen.

Chickens 10 to 20 cents per piece.

Turkeys 50 to 60 cents per piece.

Ducks 30 cents per pair.

### Things Invented by Edison

The things invented by Edison are too numerous to count. Here are some of the more important ones.

Election Recording Machine: This was his first patented invention, but it was rejected by the authorities at the time.

Telephone Transmitter: Alexander Bell's invention of the telephone would not have been successful without Edison's invention of the carbon transmitter.

Stock Ticker: He received a reward of $40,000 from this invention. He did not trust banks, so he brought the cash to the factory.

Telegraph Repeater: From this invention, four telegrams could be sent simultaneously on the same transmitter. He earned a net profit of $30,000, but attempts to invent more complex transceivers failed.

Megaphone: This invention could transmit a person's voice over a mile away and was actually the predecessor of the long-distance telephone.

Motion Pictures: He invented the famous Kinetoscope.

Phonograph: Many inventors thought this was the simplest invention.

Electric Light: This was Edison's most important invention. Before its success, he experienced countless failures.

Mining Machine: In Edison, New Jersey, there were many inventions for mining engineering.

Submarine: He made many contributions to the submarine.

Wireless Telegraph: After this invention, telegrams could be sent at any time from vehicles in motion.

Other Inventions: Address printing machine, document copier, glass plate, real-piercing fruit packaging method, phonograph, electric train, improved typewriter, storage battery, etc.

, invented the Osmium Lamp. Later, because osmium was scarce and expensive, it was not practical. In the same year, Dr. Whitney, an engineer at the American General Electric Company, invented the Gem Lamp, which still used carbon filaments but subjected them to high heat, making them more energy-efficient and brighter than previous carbon filament lamps.

In 1906, Dr. Werner V on Bolton of Germany invented the Tantalum Lamp, but it was still easy to burn out. It was not until 1907 that two Austrian youths, Alexander Just and Franz Hanaman, used a metal called tungsten to make filaments and sold the patent rights to General Electric Company. Dr. W. D. Collidge of the company improved it in 1911, and the filaments of current light bulbs are all made of tungsten.

Since then, there have been several more progressive steps: In 1929, Dr. Irving Langmuir invented the nitrogen-filled bulb, which was later improved to become the argon-filled bulb (commonly known as the "half bulb").

In 1924, Louis E. Mitchell and Arthur J. White invented the method of removing the tip of the bulb. Soon after, Mr. Marvin Pipkin, an engineer at General Electric Company, invented a type of bulb with a frosted interior.

The improvement of electric lights is endless. The latest is the coiled coil filament, which doubles the coiling of the filament, coiling it three thousand two hundred times in a space of two centimeters, making the light brighter. Shanghai General Electric Edison Factory, based on the various new inventions of the US headquarters, manufactures General Electric Edison light bulbs, which can produce ten times the light of Edison's invented light bulbs using the same amount of electricity. The factory is constantly continuing its efforts and striving for improvement. An interesting thing is that the factory director, Mr. J. S. King, was a colleague of Edison at the time. Mr. J. Mokerjs, the general manager of China and Bulb Company, which is responsible for the distribution of General Electric Edison light bulbs, and Mr. Fu Yaocheng, the director of the Shanghai business department, have also served at General Electric Company in the United States for a long time.
