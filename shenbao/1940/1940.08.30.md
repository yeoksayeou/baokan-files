### Operational History of the Chinese Army in the Dabie Mountains

A certain place in the Dabie Mountains: The Chinese army, active in the Dabie Mountains, has completely shattered the Japanese's dream of sweeping the area twice through the tenacious struggle of officers and soldiers. During this summer's Henan-Hubei Campaign, it utilized the complex terrain with extreme bravery, cutting off the Japanese supply lines everywhere on the Zhongzao Road. This caused the Japanese, who had deeply penetrated the Tangbai River area, to collapse due to the exhaustion of ammunition and food. This led to an unprecedented victory in the Henan-Hubei Campaign. Afterwards, in more than fifty days of continuous fighting, Chinese officers and soldiers were able to fight with unwavering spirit and increasing bravery, defeating all the invading Japanese forces, ensuring the safety of Xiangfan, and posing a great threat to Wuhan. According to a certain commander in the Dabie Mountains, "During the journey of resistance and nation-building, we can only shorten the time of resistance and nation-building by fully contributing all our strength to the government and obeying the leader. I instruct my subordinates based on this belief. Fortunately, in every battle, we are able to move forward bravely regardless of sacrifice. When this summer's campaign was launched, all the officers and soldiers deeply understood the strategic importance of the Dabie Mountains and were willing to coexist and die with the Dabie Mountains. Therefore, at the beginning of the Japanese offensive on May 7th, they fought fiercely with more than ten thousand Japanese troops, combined with infantry, cavalry, artillery and air force, in the Wangjiadian Changling Zhangjiaji (north of Zhongxiang) area for three days and nights. Finally, on the morning of the 7th, the Japanese were defeated and retreated towards Tianjiaji. Currently, the Japanese on the southeastern foothills of the Dabie Mountains only firmly defend the transportation strongholds along the highway and dare not come to invade and harass again. Looking back on the battles of the past fifty days, although the Chinese army's equipment is indeed inferior to the Japanese, everyone holds the determination to die, and morale is extremely high. The Japanese's dream of sweeping the Dabie Mountains three times has once again been shattered by the Chinese. (Dispatch from the 28th)

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Chinese army recently discussed the situation in Vietnam with foreign reporters.

There has been no increase in the number of Japanese troops stationed in southern Guangxi, remaining at around two divisions. The spokesman also said that he believes that if Japan invades Vietnam, the Japanese may attempt to land in Tokyo Bay rather than advance through Guangxi. This can be inferred from the fact that the number of Japanese troops stationed in Guangxi has not increased.

Regarding the banning of arms shipments to China via the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma Roads, the attitude taken by the Chinese military and civilians can be gleaned from the recent declaration of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee and Generalissimo Chiang's encouragement to the people on the third anniversary of the Anti-Japanese War. In other words, the Chinese military and civilians are determined to continue the war at all costs to achieve victory. The newspaper further stated that the military actions of the Chinese army in Shanxi have become increasingly active. The Chinese army near Shandong Province and Beiping is also more active than before.

Editorial

### The Early Stage of China's Fourth Year of Resistance is Victorious

The recent situation of the Sino-Japanese war should not be deliberately ignored by the general public! However, there are indeed various reasons that have diverted general attention and focused on multiple aspects simultaneously. For example, the situation in the Pacific has suddenly become tense due to the coveting of French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies; American policy has become more steadfast and increasingly clear, gradually developing into effective concrete actions; Great Britain and the United States have eliminated their differences and are gradually cooperating in a practical manner; the extremely fierce progress of the war between Great Britain and Germany in the North Sea and between Great Britain and Italy in Northeast Africa, with opportunities for decisive battles between the main forces, seems to be approaching maturity; all these factors, directly and indirectly, have a great impact on the future of the Sino-Japanese war, so it is no wonder that the general public is dazzled by them. Under this dazzling influence, it seems that there have been no large-scale clashes or major issues of great significance recently in the Sino-Japanese war; in fact, even recently, there has been an unintentional oversight!

The Chinese army recently fought a great victory in Shanxi Province, breaking through the important pass of Niangziguan and recovering the provincial capital of Taiyuan, all of which have been officially confirmed. It has also been very active on the Zhengtai, Pinghan, and Tongpu railway lines, destroying several sections of both the Pinghan and Tongpu lines; capturing four cannons, twenty-three machine guns, and more than three hundred rifles; capturing fourteen Japanese soldiers and killing more than a thousand. Examining these results, it is undoubtedly a great victory; however, it was by no means an unexpected, unprepared, unintentional gain; nor was it an achievement of preserving strength, planning and then acting; it was a victory of counterattack in response to the Japanese army's so-called "major offensive"; such a fierce battle is evidenced by Japanese telegrams. According to Japanese propaganda, since the 21st and 22nd, in order to sweep the Chinese army along the Zhengtai and Tongpu lines, the Japanese army's various units departed from various places along the line, roughly dividing into three routes and launching offensives simultaneously; one route advanced east along the Zhengtai line, one route advanced north along the southern Tongpu line, and one route advanced south along the northern Tongpu line; as of the 25th, it is said that the Chinese army casualties reached a total of three thousand, etc.; this was the telegram of the 26th, and the war situation after the 25th was not mentioned; while the Chinese official confirmation of the recovery of Niangziguan and Taiyuan occurred on the 28th.

Japan is determined to annex all of China and regards North China as the inner circle of its power. Shanxi is geographically a province within the North China circle that it idealizes. Since the Japanese army successively captured Taiyuan and Linfen in March of the year before last, it was satisfied that the aggressive military operations in Shanxi had come to an end, just as it fantasized that hitting Nanjing meant conquering China. It believed that only a light sweep would achieve success; unexpectedly, the facts did not allow this. Not only did the Chinese army firmly defend the important areas in the two corners of southeastern and northwestern Shanxi, but the entire mountainous area and plains outside the points and lines remained under the control of the Chinese army. The Japanese army repeatedly carried out so-called sweeps, each time only consuming resources and only securing the points and lines. In June and July of last year, it first used the most courageous posture, centering on Zhongtiao Mountain, to carry out a so-called large-scale sweep, and finally achieved nothing and retreated in the face of difficulty; then it used a large-scale strategy, targeting the Taihang Mountains and the Qin River as its scope, launching a so-called nine-route offensive, and finally being largely annihilated and ending the operation: this is the past, and the recent three-route sweep was followed by the Chinese army's recovery of Niangziguan and Taiyuan, which is exactly the anniversary of the Japanese army's failure in the nine-route offensive last year!

Every time the Japanese army launches a large-scale sweep, the Chinese army is bound to give it a head-on blow, but the recovery of important places such as Niangziguan and Taiyuan should be greatly written about in the history of the victory of the war of resistance. The significance of this, of course, is not to regard it as a decisive victory: but in terms of this battle alone, it at least proves that China's perseverance in the fourth year of resistance can reap war results that were unprecedented in the previous three years, showing the prospects of the resistance; at the same time, it also proves that the Japanese army, in its fourth year of invasion, is unable to maintain its already acquired points and lines. In terms of the overall situation, (1) Shanxi is geographically the central hub of the north, commanding a high position and able to control North China if it can control Shanxi. (2) Shanxi is also the outer defense of China's northwest hinterland, and the other party cannot control Shanxi, then it is even more impossible to get involved in the northwest. (3) Shanxi's southeastern sides are adjacent to Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces. Outside the points and lines of the occupied areas of the three provinces, all administrative veins and the use of guerrilla warfare are based on Shanxi as the hub. (4) China's commands regarding Suiyuan, Chahar, and Jehol, as well as the area further northeast of the river, everything related to the military and civilians, are all based on Shanxi as the most convenient terminal. Therefore, for all these reasons, the recent major victory of the Chinese army in Shanxi is not to say that the general public should receive good stimulation, but the general public should accurately recognize its significance.

### US President Signs National Defense Force Mobilization Bill. Conscription Bill Passed by Senate Vote. Over Ten Million Draftees to Register Soon.

Washington: US President Roosevelt yesterday signed the National Defense Force Mobilization Bill. The bill authorizes the President to call up 408,000 National Guard and Army Reserve officers and soldiers for one year of service. The President's powers extend to June 30, 1942. (Dispatch from the 29th, United Press)

Washington: The Conscription Bill was passed in the Senate yesterday by a vote of 58 to 31. Before the bill was passed, the Senate had proposed an amendment authorizing the government to establish privately owned industrial plants when necessary to ensure the production of national defense materials. The bill has now been returned to the House to obtain its consent on the Senate amendments. The House has already approved most of the bill. After this, the conscription bill stipulates that men aged 21 to 31 should be subject to one year of compulsory military service. The training scope includes the Western Hemisphere, US overseas territories, and the Philippines. According to the provisions of this bill, more than 12 million American men will need to register, of which 4 million will be selected for dispatch. The passage of the Senate Conscription Bill occurred within 24 hours after President Roosevelt signed the National Defense Force Mobilization Bill. As for the amended Conscription Bill, it may face a fierce battle in the House this week. At that time, the members who support the Conscription Bill will propose that the age of military service be from 20 to 45 and double the number of reservists. The Conscription Bill specifically states that anyone who evades military service shall be sentenced to five years of imprisonment and a fine of US$10,000. The training period is limited to one year, but it can be extended if the United States participates in the war or Congress declares a national emergency. (Dispatch from the 29th, United Press)

Washington: The Burke-Wadsworth Conscription Bill was formally passed by the US Senate late yesterday after two weeks of debate due to the mutual integration of the Republican and Democratic parties. The Postmaster General of the country will soon begin to implement registration affairs. All men within the age of military service must register. The passage of this bill by the Senate was not unexpected, because a majority of members had already guaranteed it in advance. Although some Democrats did not support it, reducing the government's power, it was fully supplemented by the Republican Party. (Dispatch from the 29th, International News Service)

House in Heated Debate on Conscription

Washington: After the Conscription Bill passed by the Senate was transferred to the House, it caused heated debate in the House, delaying the bill's quick passage.

Washington: The Conscription Bill passed by the Senate has been sent to the House for debate next week. The Senate also passed an amendment extending the government's regulations limiting profits from building ships and airplanes to military supplies, military equipment, and weapons. Although the bill will become law in at least two weeks, it is heard that the Army Department plans to spend a long time drafting all plans so that this measure can achieve practical results. (Dispatch from the 29th, Reuters)

Washington: The rapid development of the Western Hemisphere's defenses was further strengthened yesterday by the approval of the bill authorizing the President to mobilize 400,800 members of the National Guard and Reserves for training and service in various parts of the Western Hemisphere, as well as Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. This National Guard Bill, which was once fiercely opposed by members of Congress before it was passed, was signed into law by President Roosevelt yesterday and can be implemented immediately. President Roosevelt and congressional leaders have stated that the President will not exercise his power to send the National Guard and Reserves outside of US territory unless an emergency arises or a Latin American government requests assistance. However, congressional officials have recognized that this plan is concrete evidence of the United States' decision to take action in the event that any non-American country threatens the security of Western Hemisphere countries and their territories. New York Democratic Congressman Bloom expressed his satisfaction with the approval of the bill, saying that this is concrete proof that the United States intends to fulfill its responsibility to help defend the Western Hemisphere against any aggression. He also said, "I am very gratified that the development of the Western Hemisphere defense program is so rapid and so satisfactory." The President's power to implement the bill has been extended to June 30, 1942. According to the established plan, mobilization will begin within two weeks, and some people are expected to be mobilized soon. (Dispatch from the 29th, United Press)

### Quezon Severely Criticizes the Party System. The Philippine Islands Begin to Implement "New Democracy Politics"

Manila: Philippine President Quezon has begun today to educate the people with his "New Democracy Politics." Quezon's New Democracy Politics completely abolishes political parties and replaces them with a government led by public opinion. The core of his political plan is to convince the people that the selection of civil servants should be based on the past performance of each civil servant, not on political relations. In this way, partisan friction can be eliminated. A democracy without political parties is a more genuine democracy. Under true democracy, public affairs are not manipulated by parties, and people's opinions are freely expressed by the people. Quezon also said that political parties are fundamentally a bad phenomenon and are only suitable for bad purposes. Political parties are not produced by democracy, but by the desire for power. Political parties only recognize their own interests and will even sacrifice national happiness to achieve their goals. Quezon also distinguishes democracy into two types: one is democracy based on "free discussion," and the other is democracy based on "partisan debate." The former has constructive effects, while the latter makes people have good and evil hearts, and its effect is destructive. (Dispatch from the 29th, United Press)

### Township Offices in Various Counties and Villages Authorized to Handle Violations of Police Regulations - Internal Regulations Submitted to and Approved by the Executive Yuan - Effectively Strengthens the Implementation of the New County System

Chongqing: Regarding the exercise of the power to punish violations of police regulations, in the past, it was legally limited to police bureaus and their branches at all levels. Since the implementation of the new county system, the police organizations below the county level have also undergone many changes. In order to adapt to practical needs and strengthen the implementation of the new county system, the Ministry of Interior has submitted to and obtained approval from the Executive Yuan for three regulations: (1) Township offices are authorized to handle violations. Whether it be fines, detention, or labor service, the director of the security section of the township office will propose it to the township head for approval and shall immediately report it in writing to the police station for review. In areas without police stations or those closer to the county government or police bureau, they may directly report to the county government or police bureau for review. However, warnings and sentences of one day or less of detention or labor service may be handled directly by the township office without review, but they should still be compiled into a list at the end of each month for record-keeping. (2) Township offices shall compile a list of cases of violations of police regulations handled each month and post it publicly. (3) Once the rural police system is established, this authority of the township offices will naturally be lifted. The regulations have been promulgated and implemented by order of the Ministry.

Residents of London, exhausted from being confined in air raid shelters, emerged only when the all-clear siren sounded this morning (i.e., 12:00 noon Shanghai summer time). (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

London: Five hundred German bombers and fighter planes were active over southeastern England yesterday. The intensity of the German air blitz on England does not appear to have diminished. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

London: The duration and extent of the air raids on the two capitals, London and Berlin, last night and early today were unprecedented. In addition, several other centers in both countries were also subjected to heavy bombing. Approximately one thousand German aircraft were detected in the skies over England yesterday, of which at least forty-nine are reported to have been destroyed. The British lost fourteen aircraft, seven pilots, and three gunners, who are reported to have been killed or missing. German aircraft circled over the London area for no less than seven hours and ten minutes last night, dropping tons of incendiary and high-explosive bombs. However, only a few small fires were started in the capital area, and property damage was slight. Meanwhile, between 00:24 and 01:00 this morning, British aircraft dropped bombs on Berlin for approximately three hours. It is reported that several fires broke out in the center of Berlin, and a large fire broke out in southeastern Berlin. German wireless broadcasts claimed that several British aircraft flew over Berlin and dropped incendiary and high-explosive bombs in residential areas, but no military targets were hit, resulting in ten deaths and forty injuries. According to sources here, German authorities guided neutral reporters to inspect the bombed areas to convince them that the British air raids on Berlin were not aimed at military targets. However, reporters were not allowed to visit the northern and northwestern parts of Berlin, where British military activities are most concentrated. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

London: From dusk until dawn yesterday, hundreds of German aircraft carried out a fierce night-time air raid on England. During the seven hours, the German aircraft dropped thousands of bombs on ten locations in England and South Wales. It is widely believed that the German night raids are the result of Hitler's having changed his plans for daytime air raids to avoid serious air force losses. Although the German bombing was extremely heavy, the British Air Ministry announced that the casualties were still few. However, the incessant air raids have forced eight million London residents to remain confined indoors all night, unable to sleep soundly. The majority of the bombs dropped by German aircraft were small incendiary bombs, and the fires caused were quickly extinguished. There were only two major fires in the London area, which were extinguished one hour after the all-clear siren sounded at 4:00 AM (12:00 noon Shanghai summer time on Thursday). Flames and red firelight reaching the sky were visible even from the Associated Press office here. However, the fires were quickly brought under control by firefighters. The raiders relied on the diffuse cloud cover for protection, avoiding the gaze of searchlights and flying extremely high, beyond the range of anti-aircraft guns. At the same time, they also tried to avoid contact with barrage balloons. Therefore, although the sound of aircraft could be heard in the sky during the air raids, searchlights only occasionally caught sight of some German aircraft. Searchlights illuminated the skies over the outskirts of London, revealing a German aircraft. However, anti-aircraft guns did not fire at the German aircraft. Observers believe that there were perhaps twelve or fewer German aircraft over the London area. A town on the northeastern coast of England was hit by six bombs, destroying two churches and damaging several shops and civilian residences, killing one woman and injuring several others. Four bombs fell on a town in northwestern England, damaging a hospital and several residences. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

Fierce Air Combat in the Canterbury Area

London: Officials say that enemy aircraft were very active yesterday afternoon over the Canterbury coast and the Thames Estuary, as German aircraft launched a major attack. However, the overall situation is still unknown. A major air battle occurred from central Canterbury to the Thames Estuary, lasting half an hour. Enemy aircraft first flew to the south coast of Canterbury, and soon another squadron of enemy aircraft, even larger in number, flew to the north coast of Canterbury. They were met head-on by British fighter planes and dispersed and retreated. According to one account, a Messerschmitt fighter plane near a town in the southeast was shot down by a Hurricane fighter plane and crashed in an orchard and burned. The pilot parachuted down, and soldiers were already waiting on the ground, so he was captured as soon as his feet touched the ground. Before this air battle, several German aircraft flew in and released smoke to form a swastika, to guide the German aircraft that followed. However, when they crossed the coastline, they were heavily shelled by ground fire. Two pilots parachuted out and fell into the sea.

In an other attack it was reported, it was said that a Mauser-Schmitt fighter plane was shot down and crashed in an orchard and burned. The pilot parachuted down. Two paratroopers were injured during the initial attack, and they retreated to the sea. Another fourth attack happened during the afternoon where the German fighter and other allied aircrafts went down. A fighter parachuted and was unable to detach the parashoot due to damage and caused him to fall and die.

The coastal defenses that were activated in this area showed the German fighters and bombers with the most dangerous areas known by the enemy, and the German forces were met with great resistance. Seven of the enemies fell after the attack, 5 landing while two made it into the water. (Reuters)

London: The Air Ministry said that yesterday afternoon, a large squadron of German aircraft attempted to penetrate the British fighter defense line, dropping few bombs. Only slight damage to property and loss of life occurred in a town on the Thames Estuary. To date, it is known that 24 German aircraft were shot down by British fighter planes, and the British lost 12 aircraft. However, four British pilots were rescued. On the night of the 27th, the King and Queen visited the north and encountered an air raid alert shortly after leaving Buckingham Palace. However, they continued to travel slowly in the royal carriage until the all-clear siren sounded. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

London: According to incomplete reports received as of 9:00 PM last night (5:00 AM this morning Shanghai time), at least 24 German aircraft were shot down during the German attack on England on the 28th. An air raid alert was issued in the London area last night, and the German aircraft attacked earlier than on Monday and Tuesday, lasting three hours before midnight (9:00 AM this morning Shanghai time). The air raid is still in progress, and reports of bombs being dropped in this area have now been received. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

British Aircraft Bomb Various Locations in Germany and Italy

London: An Air Ministry communiqué stated that on August 27th, the British Air Force bombed military targets in Germany and Italy and in occupied France. Targets in Germany included power substations in Kiel and Wilhelmshaven, the Mauser-Schmidt factory in Augsburg, oil tanks and ammunition depots in Mannheim, and several airfields. In Italy, the Fiat factory in Turin and the Magneti Marelli factory in Sesto San Giovanni were also attacked. In occupied France, oil tanks in Pauillac and Châteaubourg near Bordeaux on the Gironde Estuary were also bombed. One British aircraft is missing. According to the Air Force Intelligence Office, most of the British aircraft flew through adverse weather, crossing France and the Alsace Mountains, with very low air currents and icing on the wings, resulting in one bomber being forced to return before completing its mission. British aircraft encountered increased difficulty due to fog when flying over Sesto San Giovanni, but still located the Magneti Marelli factory and dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs. As for the results of the attack, details are unknown due to cloud cover. Initially, a major building was hit and caught fire, and British aircraft were able to use the firelight to locate the factory, immediately dropping two batches of high-explosive bombs, hitting the main factory building. British aircraft also scattered over fifty incendiary bombs over the target area, and soon a large fire blazed into the sky, clearly visible from 15,000 feet. On Tuesday night, British heavy bombers swiftly attacked Germany, bombing the Kiel naval shipyard from a height of only 800 feet, dropping massive bombs that exploded with a roar, followed by a large fire, indicating that oil tanks had caught fire. According to a report from a British aircraft, five major fires broke out in the bombed area. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

Rome: An Italian military communiqué yesterday stated that British aircraft bombed the province of Pavia, collapsing two farmhouses and killing one farmer. It is now learned that British aircraft dropped seventeen bombs and eleven incendiary bombs in Casalnuovo. In recent nights, British aircraft attacking Italy have often flown from Switzerland, violating Swiss neutrality and disregarding Swiss protests. Political figures here have expressed to the Swiss government that they can no longer tolerate British aircraft violating neutrality and have expressed their welcome. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)

Berlin Air Raid Lasts Three Hours

Berlin: An air raid alert was issued in Berlin this morning, lasting three hours, from 00:24 to 03:17. British aircraft intermittently flew over the city of Greater Berlin, dropping numerous bombs and incendiary bombs in residential areas. Military targets suffered no damage, and other losses were minor. Ten people were killed, and twenty-eight were injured. Many houses were hit and caught fire, but they were quickly extinguished by firefighters. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)

New York: Berlin radio stations stopped broadcasting for nearly an hour tonight (New York time). Radio operators here say the stations were off the air from 8:26 AM (Shanghai Daylight Saving Time) to 9:04 AM. Observers here believe that British planes were in the area of Berlin at the time, so Berlin radio broadcasters stopped work to prevent the British from finding the location. (International News Service dispatch, 29th)

Berlin: For the first time since the start of the war, reporters today saw the damage caused by air raids in the heart of Berlin. This damage was the result of this morning's air raid. After the air raid, the Propaganda Ministry organized a tour of the bombed area, allowing foreign reporters to inspect it and investigate the damage. The area the reporters saw, according to the police, was hit by two 50-kilogram bombs, killing six people and injuring sixteen. The area is named Merckesbusch, in southeast Berlin, 1,000 meters from Grellezeal Station. The place where the bombs fell was a pit four feet deep. There were at least two unexploded time bombs nearby. According to residents of the bombed area, the bombs began to fall only ten minutes after the air raid alarm sounded. One air raid warden's leg was blown off because he was standing in front of his house door when the bomb hit. Four men and two women, who had not sought shelter after the alarm sounded and were still standing in front of their doors, were killed. The doorways of the bombed houses were stained with blood, which had not yet been removed. The streets were piled high with debris. Windows in all buildings within a mile were shattered. Firefighters were still fighting the fire. An apartment was burned by an incendiary bomb. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

German Side Announces Naval and Air War Results

Berlin: The German military headquarters issued a battle report yesterday stating that while conducting armed reconnaissance in England yesterday, they attacked Gausport. In addition, the installations of the ports from Wanlingsby on the northeast coast of England to Berwick on the Scottish border were heavily bombed. Major fires and explosions in Hereto and Show Shire were clearly visible. On the night of the 27th, German aircraft bombed military targets in Hull and Dunri and Aberin, achieving great results. In the Midlands of England, the armaments factory in Leeds, the aircraft factories in Birmingham and Derby, the arsenals and docks in Chatham were all bombed and caught fire. The Felton air base and many inland air force bases were also bombed. During the air battle, three British aircraft were shot down, and one German aircraft did not return. In addition, a German aircraft squadron attacked a convoy of merchant ships outside Firth, four of which were hit and seriously damaged. A German submarine sank two merchant ships totaling 28,600 tons. Another German warship sank two British submarines and a British oil tanker off the north coast of France. Another British oil tanker was sunk in the Indian Ocean. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)

Berlin: According to the German High Command, German aircraft bombed airfields in the Thames Estuary and the port of Lazers on the south coast of England yesterday with considerable success, and last night bombed the seaports of Liverpool, Cardiff, and Thames Haven, and the munitions factories in Sheffield and Coventry. German aircraft continued to lay mines in British seaports. In air combat, thirty-eight British aircraft were shot down, and twelve German aircraft were shot down. British aircraft attacked residential areas of Berlin last night, dropping multiple incendiary and explosive bombs, causing heavy civilian casualties and destroying several houses. One British aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire and failed to reach Berlin. The Luana factory was significantly damaged by bombing. The air raid losses in western and central Germany were also not severe. In total, Britain lost forty aircraft and one barrage balloon yesterday, and Germany lost fifteen aircraft. German submarines sank seven British armed merchant ships. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 29th)

### Germany to Send Troops to Reinforce Italian Forces in the Mediterranean - British Forces Adopt Flexible Defense Strategy - Italian Air Force Again Bombs Haifa Port

London: It was learned here yesterday that Hitler, encountering numerous difficulties in his offensive against Britain, has recently decided to shift the war to the Mediterranean. Within days, he will send a large army to the Mediterranean to reinforce the Italian forces, in order to defeat the main British forces in the waters off Alexandria and on land in Egypt. Hitler has recently become deeply concerned about the shortage of oil, believing that if the Axis powers can achieve hegemony in the Mediterranean, Britain will no longer be able to obtain oil supplies from Iraq and Iran. This move would also prevent the Soviet Union, Turkey, and the small Balkan countries from attacking the Axis powers under unfavorable circumstances. Those familiar with the situation here believe that if Britain can maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean and North Sea, Britain will be in a favorable position this winter because Britain's control of the Mediterranean means that Germany can only obtain oil from Romania via the Danube River. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

London: A Reuters military reporter stated that the British forces in the Mediterranean have once again demonstrated their combat strength and will be the decisive factor in the Middle East campaign. The Italians wished that the troops under Lieutenant General Wavell, commander of the British forces in the Middle East, would engage the Italian forces in Libya, which were in absolute superiority, in a land battle under unfavorable circumstances. However, the British did not do so, but instead used small armored vehicle units to harass the Italian outposts, preventing them from being at peace. Currently, the British fleet is conducting effective bombing of the Port of Bardia and the main Italian seaplane base in Bomba. This move was quite unexpected by the Italian military when it joined the war, especially after the collapse of the French resistance in North Africa. Because a large number of Italian troops were originally stationed on the Tunisian border, they can now be transferred to deal with the British forces in Libya. The British strategy is one of flexible defense, with a small garrison in Solum as the vanguard. The British bombing of Bardia shows that the Italian military has now increased its troops to the Solum area. A month ago, there were only two divisions of Italian vehicles, 40,000 men, in the area. The area has difficulty with supplies, very little water, and is a desert, with only one road through it. Therefore, if the Italian military attempts to advance, it will encounter great difficulties. The area is sandy with many rocks, so although large-scale operations can be carried out, there must be a road for heavy vehicles to travel on. The Italian vehicles now know that maintaining a large air force in this area, without concealment, is more harmful than beneficial. The known airfield has become a good target for British air force bombing. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

Milan: The Serra newspaper here stated this morning that several Italian aircraft dropped four and a half tons of bombs on the new oil refinery and railway tracks in Haifa port. British anti-aircraft fire was quite fierce. This new facility was recently built by the British to supply their fleet, air force, and motorized troops, and it stores a large amount of oil to prevent the Mesopotamia oil pipeline from being bombed.

Vienna District Leader Schirach, Commander of the 17th Military District General Studentzkil, and other party, government, and military representatives welcomed them at Aspern Airport.

Hungarian Planes Bomb Romanian Airfield

Bucharest: Last night, the official announcement here stated, "Recently, Hungarian planes have repeatedly flown into Romanian territory. Although protests have been lodged several times, they have not been effective. Hungarian airmen have dropped leaflets opposing Romania in places such as Kronstadt. The Romanian military authorities have had no choice but to use force to stop these flights. At 12:15 PM yesterday, one or two Hungarian planes appeared at Cadar, but Romanian planes drove them back. At 10:15 AM today, Hungarian plane number 225 dropped six bombs on the Mar airfield, destroying one hangar. The Hungarian plane was forced to land. Captain Kiss and Lieutenant Fours were arrested." (Hai Tong Telegram, 29th)

The Task of the Vienna Conference

Rome: The intelligence conference here yesterday released a statement to foreign journalists regarding Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Germany and his talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, stating that although the Severin talks have encountered difficulties, the door to reopening negotiations has not been closed. Therefore, the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy are traveling together to Vienna to discuss the outstanding issues between Romania and Hungary. Germany and Italy have repeatedly made it clear that they hope Romania and Hungary will engage in direct negotiations to discuss the issue of Hungarian minorities in order to conclude an agreement and maintain peace in the Balkans. During the Severin talks, Germany and Italy did not exert pressure on either side, but Germany and Italy could not ignore the actions of the enemy. It should be stated that the Vienna Conference held by the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy demonstrates the goodwill of the Axis powers, hoping to promote the conclusion of an agreement between Romania and Hungary. The attitude of the democratic countries is to obstruct Germany and Italy from peacefully revising the post-war treaties. This is a consistent policy of the democratic countries. Although this is the case, the Axis powers are still striving to revise the Danube region. This proves the constructive spirit of the Axis powers' policies. Italian Minister to Hungary Vitetti and Italian Minister to Romania Guicci accompanied Foreign Minister Ciano on this trip. In addition, there were two secretaries and consuls.

Hungarian Government Accuses Romania of Provocation

Budapest: The Hungarian government's communiqué declared that the Romanian Air Force has taken "organized provocative actions," repeatedly violating Hungarian borders and attempting to lure Hungarian fighter planes into Romanian airspace. (Hai Tong News Agency Telegram, 29th)

German Newspaper Observes Hungarian-Romanian Issue

Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry mouthpiece, "German Foreign Policy Correspondence," published an article today commenting on the conference held in Vienna by the foreign ministers of Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Romania, declaring that the territorial dispute between Romania and Bulgaria was resolved after a short period of time, while the Romanian-Hungarian issue has been delayed until now. The Axis powers, with a policy of appeasement as a prerequisite, cannot sit idly by and watch the increasingly tense relationship between Romania and Hungary, and must seek a solution to the outstanding issue. The newspaper emphasized that in order to maintain the so-called "balance of power," Britain and France often did not hesitate to stir up hatred and jealousy among small countries, but Germany and Italy want to sweep away this system. Therefore, they convened meetings in Salzburg, Rome, and Munich, the purpose of which is none other than to allow Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and other countries to resolve their old grievances and jointly plan for progress. (Hai Tong News Agency Telegram, 29th)

Bucharest: It is expected that the conference of the diplomatic authorities of Italy, Germany, Romania, and Hungary in Vienna today will produce results soon. The German view here is that although the Axis powers do not intend to arbitrate between Romania and Hungary, they want Romania and Hungary to resolve their disputes as soon as possible. The German-language daily newspaper in Bucharest published authorized texts, stating that the so-called justice is order, not this or that opinion. Anyone who still does not understand the spirit of European structure should know that the Axis powers have the tools to implement their plans. Romania's attitude is still that negotiations with Hungary must be based on the principle of exchanging populations. The official Romanian newspaper stated that this principle was expressed by the Axis powers to Romania. Regarding the rumor that Romanian fighter planes shot down a Hungarian plane, the newspapers here did not report the battle. Romanian officials said that a Hungarian plane had flown into Romanian territory. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)

### There is No Serious Conflict Between the Soviet Union and Romania

Bucharest: Hai Tong News Agency interviewer Henry Chu learned yesterday that the report in foreign newspapers on the 27th about a serious conflict between Soviet and Romanian troops, with hundreds of casualties on both sides, was completely exaggerated. This exaggerated record was apparently caused by a small border incident, because some places on the Soviet-Romanian border have not been clearly delineated, and both sides do not overemphasize small border incidents. Well-informed sources say that it will not cause serious consequences. (Hai Tong Telegram, 29th)

Rome: The Romanian Minister to Rome has formally announced that the reports in American news agencies and foreign newspapers about conflicts on the Soviet-Romanian border are completely fabricated. The border there is in good order. (Hai Tong Telegram, 29th)

### British Cabinet Members Work Tensely

London: Although British Prime Minister Churchill is planning the war effort and is very busy, according to his friends, Churchill is in good spirits and is prepared to deal with the various problems that arise every day. The two-week parliamentary recess does provide an opportunity for the members of parliament to rest, but this is not necessarily the case for the cabinet members. Because there is no need to attend parliament, they can make orderly arrangements for their time, so they are even busier than before. Most cabinet members work at least fourteen hours a day in the office, and many return home to continue working. In fact, most cabinet members now live in the office, and the members of the wartime cabinet can be found at any time when they need to meet. The cabinet often meets two or three times a day. In addition, each cabinet member has his own special duties. For example, Prime Minister Churchill, in addition to his own responsibilities, also serves as Minister of Defence, and meets with his subordinate ministers every day to discuss the decisions of the war cabinet and implement them when necessary. The various aspects of the war situation are reviewed by the cabinet members almost every day. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)

### France Points Out British Hostility

Vichy: The French Pétain government yesterday instructed its foreign envoys to provide instructions on France's attitude towards Britain, and stated that France's attitude is the result of various anti-French actions by Britain. The so-called anti-French actions can be listed as follows:

(1) The British government maintains formal relations with General de Gaulle, who has rebelled against the French Pétain government.

(2) British diplomatic and consular officials in French colonies encourage colonial people to rebel.

(3) British planes escape to France without military necessity.

(4) Illegal detention of French people, troops, and ships.

(5) Insist on blockading the French people, regardless of the guarantees of France and Germany.

(6) British official propaganda openly criticizes the Pétain government. (Hai Tong Telegram, 29th)

### Partial Reorganization of the Portuguese Cabinet

Lisbon: After the Portuguese government signed a religious treaty with the Vatican, it appointed the current Minister of Education, Paquito, as the Ambassador to the Vatican in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, and obtained the consent of the Vatican.

### National Currency 1,000 Yuan to Inquire About Three Secrets: Reward for "New Lede Neng"

To gonorrhea, exposing the Asian fruit that hides illness;

To patients, breaking the misconception of shameful secrets;

The new drug for gonorrhea, "New Lede Neng," has recently published a huge reward of 1,000 yuan, and depicts five pairs of newly married men and women, one of whom is physically healthy. One pair gave birth to a noble son after marriage, and one suffered from gonorrhea, which they considered a secret. The public can guess at will. If the guess completely matches the original file, they will receive a reward of 1,000 yuan in national currency. The file is sealed by the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and displayed in the window of the Li Ji Pharmacy on Nanjing Road. On September 29, Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mr. Li Wenjie are invited to testify, and members of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association will be sent to open the seal in public. Since the publication of this reward, due to its strong interest, people have flocked to nearby pharmacies to obtain the "Secret Form" and participate in the disclosure, causing a sensation. This reward is intended to be profound. Originally, those who suffer from leukorrhea often mistakenly believe that it is an infamous secret disease, hiding the illness and avoiding medical treatment, or letting it progress and being helpless, or mistakenly taking inferior medicine, adding fuel to the fire, making mistakes again and again, and causing tragic consequences such as madness and blindness, are everywhere. Therefore, this huge reward is set up to break the misconception of patients' shameful secrets, firmly take "New Lede Neng," kill all gonococci in the body within 72 hours, and completely eradicate the disease in three days, and have normal fertility.

As the saying goes; "Wealth should be hidden, illness should be spoken," this is indeed an experienced saying. Because if you publicly talk about the pain of gonorrhea, when relatives and friends hear about it, they will definitely tell you the treatment method, or advise you to take "New Lede Neng," because there are many people everywhere who have completely eradicated gonorrhea by taking "New Lede Neng." They must have personal experience and will honestly tell you.

### Contributed the Most to China's Military; Sino-German Friendship is Becoming More Intimate; The Battle of Taierzhuang Showed Great Achievements; Trade Between the Two Countries is Expected to Return to Brightness; German Commissioner Cordes Expresses His Sentiments Yesterday

"The friendship between China and Germany will definitely make great progress in the future." With this sentence as the center of the conversation, the German Embassy in China's information commissioner answered questions from visitors. The conversation lasted one hour. During this long conversation, we had a cordial discussion on various issues such as politics, military affairs, economy, and even sports education. Commissioner Cordes' words were eloquent and admirable. Mr. Cordes is most concerned about promoting Sino-German cultural relations. The following is a record of Mr. Cordes's conversation:

Sending National Affairs Advisors to China

The relationship between Germany and China has always been very harmonious. For example, sending the highest military advisors to China, five of the advisors who were sent are outstanding talents in today's German military technology field. Mr. Cordes then pointed out that the first person was General Wetzell, who is now considered one of the "important cadres in the German military" and is currently the editor-in-chief of the German military journal "Militär-Wochenblatt." The first person, Lieutenant Colonel Kreipe, is also an important military talent and is currently a senior official in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The third person was von Seeckt, who has passed away due to illness, but his achievements in organizing the German army after the First World War will be immortalized in German history. The fourth person was von Reichenau, who enjoys a worldwide reputation and is one of Germany's bravest military leaders. His rank has recently been promoted from major general to general. The fifth person was Falkenhausen, a famous strategist. It is said that the Chinese army was able to win the Battle of Taierzhuang in 1938 thanks to this German advisor. He held an important military position in the Netherlands in this Western Front war.

Trade Between the Two Countries Sees Prosperity Again

Later, talking about the situation of Sino-German economic relations, Mr. Cordes said that from 1932 to 1937, Germany jumped from seventh to second place in China's foreign trade. This is a well-known fact recorded in the Chinese customs statistics. However, recently, due to the war in Europe and the suspension of German ships to the Far East, Germany's trade with China has declined. Mr. Cordes believes that in the near future, Sino-German trade will reach pre-war figures again. How the Chinese people value and cherish the fair trade of the German industrial sector can be seen in the recent commemoration of the deceased German businessman Dorf. The German businessman was called "one of the first foreign business leaders to trade fairly with the Chinese and treat each other equally."

Cultural Communication Needs Time to Develop

Regarding Sino-German cultural relations, Mr. Cordes emphasized that although there is a war today, Germany's propaganda is not limited to stating Germany's views on this war. In terms of cultural relations, it also repeatedly considers future development. The outbreak of the European war has reduced the number of Chinese students studying in Germany, but Mr. Cordes believes that after the end of the war in Europe and Asia, the number of exchange students between China and Germany will greatly increase. Finally, Mr. Cordes mentioned the news reported in Chinese newspapers that Germany was recruiting Chinese workers in France to facilitate Germany's war against Britain. Mr. Cordes said that the German Embassy believes that this news is baseless. Moreover, according to previous news, the Chinese in France have already been forced to leave France.

### Fujian and Zhejiang Coastal Vessels Sunk in Large Numbers; Japanese Ships Patrol the "Blockade Line" and Bomb Chinese Ships Upon Seeing Them

The North-China Daily News reported that, according to an announcement yesterday (28th), in the past few days, several Chinese ships on the coast of Central China have attempted to cross the blockade line imposed by the Japanese and were sunk by Japanese patrol ships. (1) On the 25th, when a Japanese ship was patrolling outside Zhenhai, it saw a Chinese medium-sized ship attempting to enter the port and sank it with artillery fire. On the same day, several medium-sized ships near Yuhuan and Kanmen in southern Zhejiang were severely damaged by Japanese shelling. (2) On the 26th, there were three medium-sized cargo ships carrying war supplies in Taizhou Bay that were shelled by Japanese ships. (3) On the 7th, Japanese ships sank three ships near Xiangshan Port that were attempting to cross the blockade line and shelled Chinese ships concentrated in Wenzhou Bay. Two of them attempted to escape and were pursued and sunk by Japanese ships.

### Shanghai Remits Money to Chongqing to Relieve Bombing Victims; Entrusted to the Chongqing Municipal Government to Oversee the Distribution

Chongqing, 29th: The Shanghai Da Mei Evening News recently entrusted the Central Bank to remit more than 2,800 yuan in national currency to the Chongqing Municipal Government as a donation to relieve bombing victims. It is heard that the Municipal Government has replied to handle it accordingly. In this time of national crisis, the sympathy and righteous acts of both Chinese and foreigners are truly admirable.

### Foreign and Chinese Organizations Farewell An Li De

On the 9th, organizations such as the American University Alumni Association of this city, the Children's Nutrition Promotion Association, the Chinese Fine Arts Society, the Shanghai Returned Students Association, the Shanghai YMCA, and the Shanghai Sino-Western Friendship Association held a farewell party at the American Club for Mr. An Li De, the American Commercial Counselor in China, and his wife. Members of the six organizations who wish to attend should contact Mr. Xiao Wu'en of the Baxianqiao YMCA.

### Radio Materials Case: Ministry Lodges Protest

According to well-informed sources, the old radio materials of the Ministry of Communications stored at two locations on Avenue Albert and Rue Tenant de la Tour in this city were reportedly handed over to the French Concession authorities for safekeeping when the Chinese army retreated from western Shanghai. Important components among them were secretly transported and used before the handover. The components recently transported by the Japanese side seem to consist mostly of large sets and incomplete scrap materials, and the loss is not very significant. It is reported that the Chongqing Ministry of Communications has lodged a serious protest with the French Embassy.

### Ningbo Compatriots Schedule Rehearsal for Fundraising

Ningbo natives in Shanghai, including gentlemen and merchants Yuan Ludeng, Huang Lianfang, Huang Zhenshi, etc., have launched a fundraising performance due to the repeated air raids in Ningbo. Yesterday, they issued a notice to all sectors, stating, "We hereby inform you that our Ningbo has suffered severe grain shortages and has been ravaged by war. The entire town of Zhenhai is almost in ruins, with devastation everywhere, families torn apart, wives and children scattered, and mourning everywhere. The situation is too tragic to bear. We, out of deep affection for our hometown, cannot stand idly by. We have specially invited Ningbo opera troupes and famous amateur and professional performers in Shanghai to hold a rehearsal at the Ningbo Association on September 8th this year to raise funds to help the refugees. Considering the severity of the disaster, we rely on the collective efforts of everyone. We sincerely hope that charitable individuals in Shanghai will generously contribute to this cause."

### Termination of British Gold Note Exchange: Aggregated and Shipped to London, But British Currency Not Absolutely Unusable Thereafter; Money Exchange Businesses May Depress Prices for Profits

The British Embassy announced that after the ban on the import of Bank of England banknotes into the UK, the exchange by British banks in China and the Bank of China was terminated last night after a two-day extension. Today, the money exchange market will suspend quotations. Various money exchange firms secretly depress prices or continue to buy. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from foreign banks yesterday that the measures announced by the British Embassy on the 22nd of this month were a remedial measure for remittances to China after the ban on banknotes entering the UK, so that this ban would not affect the normal remittances of British gold handled by banks. In the future, except for banks duly recognized and sent to their managers in the UK, banknotes sent by private individuals or any institutions will not be credited to the account when they arrive in the UK.

Aggregated and Shipped to England

The Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China was ordered to take into account the interests of Chinese people holding the British gold notes. The Foreign Exchange Department of the bank exchanged them at the official exchange rate without limitation, which ended yesterday. From today, it has been decided to stop exchanging British currency, and the British currency received will be transferred to the head office for aggregation and shipment to London. The number of exchanges in Shanghai is not large, but the British currency received in various places is more. Yesterday was the last day, and more people went to exchange for legal tender.

Bank of England Exchange

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from HSBC and Chartered Bank yesterday that the two banks' exchange of pound notes would be closed last night and would not be extended. The exchange rate yesterday was 54.08 yuan per pound in Chinese legal tender, and it was not limited to customers. All note holders could apply for exchange, and there was no distinction between large and small notes.

Stop Quotations

Although the trading of British gold notes was not much in the money exchange market yesterday, the price has rebounded. The quotation for buying was 54.20 yuan. From today, the quotation for British currency notes will be suspended. However, foreign currencies such as British gold pounds and US dollar notes will be traded and quoted as usual. In the future, British gold notes in Shanghai are not absolutely unusable, only they cannot be imported into the UK for accounting, and they are still the common currency of the UK. Therefore, money exchange firms intend to depress prices and secretly buy them, depending on the market situation at that time and whether there is a general need, because there are thick profits to be made. Because all travelers from China to the UK can carry 10 pounds of British gold notes into the country.

### Millard's Review Discusses America's Distant Containment Policy

According to Millard's Review published today: Today's Far East is really nothing more than a picture of crisis and a country in motion. Even in a single day, no one knows what events will happen. Since Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931, which was tolerated by the great powers, the entire world has had no peace.

Japan Implements a Policy of Plunder

The original status quo in the Far East was overturned by Japan, and the original order was replaced by turmoil. Therefore, Japan is a disruptive force in the Far East. Although Tokyo uses all kinds of lofty principles as a "banner," the world will soon understand that what Japan is pursuing is nothing more than a policy of plunder. This is true of China, and it is also true of the interests of the great powers in the Far East, as well as commercial interests.

Japan's Greed is Endless

The Sino-Japanese war has lasted for three years, and Japan is no closer to its dream of conquering and enslaving China than it was at the beginning of the war. At the same time, World War II is underway. Britain is fighting a desperate battle against Nazi Germany for its own survival, and the United States has to pay most of its attention to the European war, because Germany's victory over Britain will immediately endanger the Western Hemisphere. This situation makes the Japanese believe that if they can quickly end the war of aggression against China, it will be a good time to implement the southward policy. In order to implement this goal, Japan threatened Britain and France, as well as their Far Eastern colonies, to close China's most important international routes, so as to intensify the blockade against China. However, the concessions of Britain and France were enough to make the Japanese militarists even more greedy. French Vietnam has been under direct threat from Japan, and may soon become the food of "Greater Japan" and will soon be used as a new base for invading China. Hong Kong is also uneasy under the supervision of the Japanese navy, as is the case with the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Thailand (Siam). As for the fate of the concessions of the great powers in China, it is even more precarious.

Hawks Soar and Wait for Opportunities

Japan's decisive actions in the Far East are now based on the outcome or prospects of the "Battle of Britain." Japan's desire to satisfy its territorial greed will never be worth facing a victorious Britain. It is expected that Britain will then urgently liquidate the aggressors in the Far East. On the contrary, it is just like Italy waiting for the collapse of France before helping Germany to fight. Japan is also waiting for the collapse of Britain's resistance to Germany. President Roosevelt once compared Italy to an assassin, saying that it stabbed people in the back with a sharp knife. The Japanese militarists are like hawks soaring over the battlefield, waiting to tear the bodies of those who are unfortunately killed into pieces.

The Battle of Britain Affects the Far East

Therefore, the future of the Battle of Britain has a decisive effect on the future situation in the Far East. The Nazi war machine has not yet shown any signs of defeating Britain, but now that the war has entered its second year, this battle is likely to form a long-term stalemate. Under this situation, there is little hope for the future of the Far East to restore true peace and security.

It is Impossible for the US and Japan to Make Peace

Britain's appeasement policy toward Japan has been fiercely attacked, but in the United States, some people also believe that the United States' main concern is in the Atlantic. This view is tantamount to the United States also pursuing an appeasement policy in the Far East, just as former Chief of Naval Operations Naval Admiral Stirling (YalerStirling) stated this week that the United States needs "naval and air bases in Central and South America, and cooperation with Latin American countries, in order to prevent the establishment of enemy (German) bases in this area. Skilled naval experts to promote the progress of the large naval construction program, as well as Liu Ri's friendly relations with the Soviet Union in the Pacific. At the very least, this move is necessary before the completion of the large naval fleet." Judging from Japan's past actions, how can the United States develop friendship with Japan without actually stabbing China in the back and without sacrificing the commercial and other interests of the United States in China and neighboring areas? These interests are the result of more than a century of hard work. If they are really sacrificed, it will definitely make the American expatriates in China feel troubled.

The US Authorities Know What to Choose

The argument for making concessions to Japan may be that the losses at this time, even if serious, can be recovered once a strong fleet is built. However, it must be known that once rights and interests are sacrificed, it is not easy to return the jade, and if it can be recovered again, the price will be extraordinarily high. If the United States also follows the example of Britain and France and implements an appeasement policy toward Japan, the ultimate price will be the outbreak of a major war in the Pacific. Even if Britain can defeat the Nazis, it will take considerable years. This period of time is enough for Japan to strengthen its position on the Far Eastern mainland and in the entire Far East. It will be impossible to overthrow it again, or it will be extremely difficult. The US concessions to Japan, if implemented, will inevitably allow Japan to achieve its dream of monopolizing the Far East. The above views should undoubtedly be deeply considered by the US authorities, and they should hesitate before preparing to make concessions to Japan.

### Emergency Measures Taken in the Rice Market: Rice Prices Suddenly Rise Again; Market Management Committee Closed Early Yesterday; No. 2 Saigon Rice Exceeded the Price Limit

Rice Grain Evaluation Committee held an emergency meeting, and the resolutions were reported to the authorities of the two concessions for record, and the rice shops, tea houses, and markets will be announced today. According to market reports, the prices of various imported rice have gradually increased recently, and there is a trend of exceeding the assessed prices. Therefore, this committee convened an urgent meeting on the 29th of this month and put forward discussions. Everyone agreed that although the production price of imported rice has increased, the stock in Shanghai is still abundant, and the prices announced on the 16th of last month should still be maintained. If there are any hidden transaction prices, once the report is verified, it should be reported to the authorities of the two concessions for severe punishment, etc. It is specially recorded as a public announcement, and it is hoped that everyone will abide by it, which is most important."

Exceeding the Price Limit and Closing Early

After the foreign ships sailing from Haiphong were changed to sail to Hong Kong temporarily, the general speculative rice merchants took the opportunity to stir up trouble, taking advantage of the interruption of the source of foreign rice. They raised the prices of stored rice and released them into the market. On the one hand, they spread rumors in the market, causing people's hearts to be disturbed and the market situation to be volatile. The rice shop tea house market opened as usual at 7:30 yesterday morning. Speculators were very active, and there were many people for a while. Hidden transactions were rampant again, and market prices rose frequently. No. 1 Saigon and Huojiao rice both rose to the price limit, and No. 2 Saigon even exceeded the price limit. The market management committee, in view of the fact that the industry did not comply with the regulations, rang the bell at 1:30 to close early. If the rice prices of each stall exceed the price limit, the evaluation committee should be responsible.

### After the Haiphong Line Was Suspended: Foreign Ships Sail to Hong Kong; Mingsheng Left Yesterday

The navigation between this port and Haiphong has been interrupted, and there is no hope of restoring the shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong for a while. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship left Shanghai early yesterday morning (the 20th) and sailed to Hong Kong as its final destination. As for Swire's Qingyuan, Jinan, Hunan, and Haikou ships, they have also been scheduled to be exported and all go to Hong Kong. There is also Swire's Qiongzhou ship, which sails to Haiphong, scheduled to be exported on the 4th of next month and sail to Little Luzon. The Anhui ship will sail to Singapore via Hong Kong. Regarding the shipping affairs between Shanghai and Saigon, various shipping companies have not yet scheduled the schedule as of yesterday. According to shipping industry sources, this is affected by the interruption of navigation between Hong Kong and Vietnam. However, according to the passenger ticket office of the French Post Office in this port, there are very few ships sailing to Haiphong and Saigon, because there are trains between Haiphong and Saigon, which is more convenient than water transportation. In addition, the French Post's Xijiang ship should arrive in Haiphong today. After arriving in Haiphong, it will transfer to Saigon. However, whether it will return to Shanghai via Japan along the original route after arriving in Saigon has not yet been decided.

### British Authorities Telegraph Gratitude for Donation to Purchase Aircraft

The North China Daily News stated that Lord Beaverbrook, the British Minister of Aircraft Production, telegraphed the British Consulate General in Shanghai the day before yesterday (28th) to convey to all British expatriates in Shanghai the British government's thanks for the first batch of wartime funds donated by the British expatriates in this port. The British expatriates in this port have remitted the first batch of wartime funds, £52,000 in British currency, to London for the purchase of aircraft. Lord Beaverbrook's telegram is as follows: "The donations sent by the British expatriates in China have filled us with deep gratitude. Please convey to the generous donors the gratitude of our people for their loyalty and enthusiasm during this national crisis. They have strengthened the strength of the Royal Air Force to defend the bastion of Britain, which is to strengthen the doctrine of freedom in all continents of the world."

### High Tides Expected Early Next Month

The Huangpu River will have high tides again starting on the 2nd of next month. The quantity will be around two English feet above normal. As the Yangtze River is in flood season, the discharge of water is rapid, so it is extremely important. If it meets with a hurricane, it will develop into a serious flood. The Customs is closely monitoring its development, and the wharves along the river should pay more attention to flood control measures and not neglect them.

### British Troops Withdrawing from Shanghai Have Left Wusong and Are Sailing South: Destination Not Disclosed by Officials

It is reported that they left Wusong on the 27th. Shanghai has left 50 members of the East Surrey Regiment to protect the British Embassy in Shanghai. It is said that the destination of the withdrawing British troops is Hong Kong and Singapore, but the official destination of the withdrawing British troops has not been announced.

### Nanyang Tobacco Factory Engineer Kuang Zhaoqi Kidnapped Yesterday: Bandits Robbed Yunfei Automobile in Advance, Kidnapped from Residence on Wenlin Road Without a Trace

Yesterday morning, Kuang Zhaoqi, who lived at No. 19 Wenlin Road in the French Concession, was suddenly invaded by two kidnappers who kidnapped him into a Yunfei car parked in front of the door, and sped away without knowing where he was going. The details of the kidnapping case are recorded below. Kuang Zhaoqi, a Cantonese man, is 45 years old and lives at No. 19 Wenlin Road in the French Concession. Kuang has been an engineer at the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's main factory in Hong Kong and was transferred to Shanghai last year to work at the company on Avenue Edward VII, with a monthly salary of only 200 yuan. Kuang initially lived at No. 123, Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, and only moved to the current address in May of this year. Unexpectedly, at 9:05 yesterday morning, Kuang was still sleeping soundly in the upstairs bedroom. Unexpectedly, at this time, a Yunfei car suddenly drove to the back door of the building and stopped. Two kidnappers jumped out of the car, one wearing a white silk short shirt and pants, and the other wearing a striped silk shirt and pants, wearing straw hats. They entered through the back door along the road, took out a gun, went straight upstairs, and helped Kuang up from the bed and bound him into the car. The kidnappers were very agile in tying up, and it only took a few minutes before they sped south. Afterwards, Kuang's wife reported the information to the French Concession Police for assistance. Before the case occurred, the Yunfei Automobile Company in this port had two cars robbed by bandits yesterday morning, one was No. 12339 and the other was No. 12284. It was later found that No. 12339 was the one used by the kidnappers to kidnap Kuang. Afterwards, at about 11:00, the car was found by French Concession Police officers in the territory. As for No. 12284, it was also found on Yidingpan Road on Daxilu, and it is unknown what it was used for.

### Portuguese Ship Robbed in Nan Huangpu: Five Thieves Board Ship to Loot; Grab Cash and Clothes

The North China Daily News stated that the Portuguese merchant ship Zhengde Gong Shantai, which berthed at the No. 11 pontoon on the Huangpu River in Nanshi on the 24th of this month, was robbed by armed bandits on board at night. It was not until the 26th that the crew reported the robbery to the company, and the Water Police learned about it and began to investigate. The Shantai used to sail between Shanghai and various ports in eastern Zhejiang. After the Japanese naval authorities banned coastal navigation, the ship unloaded all its cargo and was idle on the Bund of the Public Concession. It has recently been berthed in the Huangpu River in Nanshi. At about 10:00 pm on the 24th, five thieves, three of whom were armed with guns, sailed to the side of the ship in a sampan and boarded the ship together. Six Chinese crew members on the ship, four of whom were playing cards on the right deck, had already boarded the ship. They took out their guns and threatened the six crew members separately, forcing them into a corner, guarded by one thief. The remaining thieves broke into the cabin through the window and calmly searched one by one. However, they only got 300 yuan in cash from the comprador's room and some clothes from the crew members. They escaped after half an hour. At that time, Captain Aquino was ashore. When he boarded the ship the next day, he learned about it. According to Mr. Ya's statement yesterday (28th), there were several other ships moored near the ship. It is surprising that the bandits were able to rob at will without being noticed by other ships. Only his own room was not searched, which was fortunate, he said. According to the police, the bandits had been spying on the ship for days and seized the opportunity to strike.

### Naughty Children Cause Trouble: Parents Enter the Scene to Commit Assault; Result: Mutual Lawsuits for Injuries

Youth students Zhang Zequn (22 years old, from Wujiang, studied at Datong High School), Chen Xihuai (20 years old, from Tianjin, studied at Shanghai Provincial High School), Sun Jiadong (10 years old, from Yangzhou, studied at St. John's University), and Sun Jiamo (18 years old, brother of Sun Jiadong, studied at the Shanghai Municipal Council Yucai Middle School), etc., reside next to each other in Wenyuanfang on Avenue Emerey in the French Concession. At 5 pm on the 25th of this month, Zhang and others were sitting in the lane, enjoying the cool and chatting when a child from Ouyang Rong's family at No. 208 in the same lane, who was more than ten years old, was annoying in the lane and insulted and scolded Zhang Zequn for no reason, causing a verbal argument. Later, the child went home to complain to his father. Ouyang Borong, together with his wife, two concubines, and more than ten male and female servants from home, rushed out and twisted Zhang without asking about the situation and beat him violently. After Chen and the two Suns and neighbors in the same lane persuaded him to disperse, Zhang was seriously injured. He went to the hospital for treatment and requested the prosecutor's office of the Special No. 2 Court to send someone to examine the injuries. He filed a criminal lawsuit against Ouyang and his wife and concubines for the crime of injury in the Special No. 2 Court. Ouyang learned that Zhang had filed a lawsuit, so he reported to the French Concession Police on the day that Zhang and the two Suns had committed the crime of injury and that he was being treated in the hospital, requesting investigation. The detective, according to the report, sent detectives to investigate. Because Zhang was injured in the hospital, he summoned Chen and the two Suns for questioning and sent them to the Criminal Division 8 of the Special No. 2 Court yesterday. The police lawyer Yuan Jiahong stated the case and filed a lawsuit according to law. The plaintiff Ouyang Borong was represented by the woman Gao Xiuying, who stated the process of being beaten and injured and commissioned a lawyer to file an incidental civil lawsuit, seeking compensation for medical expenses and losses. When Chen Xihuai and the Sun Jiadong and Jiamo brothers were questioned, they pleaded not guilty of being accomplices and were present to dissuade them. Zhang Zequn commissioned a lawyer to state that he was beaten and injured and treated in the hospital, and also requested the court to examine the injuries, etc. After examination by Judge Yuan Xiaogen, he ordered that the trial be adjourned to September 7.

The total donation has now reached 11,648.5 yuan.

### Xinda Xiang Building Increases Rent by 80 Percent: All Tenants Send Representatives to Court and Public Groups to Request Assistance

Tens of tenants in Shanghai that include Meiduo, Jinling, Far East, Hua, Huanqiu, etc., at Xinda Xiang Building, No. 614 Nanjing Road, oppose the landlord Xinda Xiang's proposal to increase the rent by 80 percent, setting the highest rent increase record in Shanghai's history. Not only is it difficult to bear, but it is also enough to cause various serious social problems with rent. They sent representatives to the landlord Xinda Xiang to negotiate and plead, and to consider the difficult times and avoid the rent increase, but it was not approved, and the original rent was refused to be collected. The tenants had no choice but to deposit all the rent in the court. Now the tenant representatives suddenly received a summons from the court, only to learn that the landlord Xinda Xiang had filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court to increase the rent separately. In addition to continuing to ask the landlord to consider the difficult times and not to go too far, the tenants also sent representatives to the court, the Chinese Taxpayers Association, and various public groups to request assistance and uphold justice.

### The Hengmao Lane Gold Bar Robbery Case: Translation by Police Leads to Plot, Handgun Transported by Dismissed Chinese Constable, Key Suspects All Arrested and Detained for Investigation

On July 17th, Wang Zhiren, a Shandong native residing at No. 35 Hengmao Lane, Mintiniyin Road, was robbed of twenty-eight gold bars worth over 140,000 yuan. After the incident, the French police station was informed and notified all jewelry stores to be vigilant. Subsequently, the police station learned that the Lao Tian Bao Silver Shop on Robert Sheng Road had purchased the stolen goods. The shop's manager, Wang Binggen, was arrested and confessed. He was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Judge Li Weishen postponed the trial. During the postponement, the police:

### Visiting Mr. Huang Jue Si's Painting Exhibition

— (Lao)

In today's era and environment, everyone inevitably experiences deep emotions in their life. For example, when singing loudly, one feels that the inner meaning is not enough to express oneself to the world. When pondering over the past, one wonders whether life is a dream or a fleeting cloud. I believe that in the process of life, the contemplation of beautiful environments and the feeling of withering and hardships are like a rose, or like a scene of flowing water and high mountains. I am afraid that only artists can capture and discover them, and even discover the essence of beauty hidden in the world.

I went to see Mr. Huang Jue Si's solo exhibition held in the painting hall of the Great China Company for a long time. I deeply feel that Mr. Huang's works have the power to capture and discover, and even discover the essence of beauty hidden in the world.

There are a total of 158 works, with realistic depictions of "movement" and "stillness," the perfection of color and lines, and the recollection of endless processes, such as "Autumn in Luxembourg," "Streets of Paris," and "Lingyin Road," "Fallen Leaves on Wujiang River," which make people contemplate and feel emotional. Moreover, works like "Journey of Ten Thousand Miles," "Fruit Thief," and "Face of a Girl," each scene's lyricism has its own profound and wonderful artistic meaning.

I believe that Mr. Huang must also have a profound understanding of literary and artistic cultivation. How can I achieve this? Therefore, I record it.

### Finance: Speculators Advance on Foreign Exchange Again, All Due to the Abundance of Floating Capital: Long Quiet, Yet Again Thinking of Stirring

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, there was a violent rally. Throughout the day, a huge bullish trend suddenly appeared. In the midst of public anxiety, general speculators took the opportunity to move. Due to the abundance of floating capital in this city, if there is no appropriate use, the future foreign exchange market may be difficult to return to tranquility. The morning was still calm, but later, foreign firms suddenly came to settle accounts. Rumors spread that the Japanese army had landed on the coast, and speculators turned from selling to buying, so the price softened. The noon close for American exchange was 5.40625 yuan. In the afternoon, speculators continued to buy. Sellers decreased. With supply and demand unequal, the upward trend became more pronounced. As a result, British gold closed at 3 shillings 59375, and American exchange closed at 5.34375 yuan, compared with yesterday, British exchange rose .03125, and American exchange fell .125. The softening trend of American exchange futures slowed down slightly, so there was a slight short squeeze.

Frequent Settlement of Accounts by Foreign Firms

In the early morning, due to the sharp drop of 0.615 in both near-term and far-term London major strips, the price of silver in New York remained flat, the price of gold in London was fixed, the exchange rate of British pounds to American dollars did not move, and the exchange rate to Shanghai was also flat. The exchange rates of American dollars to British pounds and Shanghai dollars did not change, and there was no market for French currency. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the morning opening, the bank's spot selling price for British gold was 3 shillings and .625, and the American exchange rate was 5.46875 yuan, which was flat for both British and American exchange rates compared to the closing price of the previous day. After opening, Chinese banks and Chinese merchant speculators sold unanimously, so the market was slightly hardened in the stillness. It is estimated that American banks and HSBC and other Chinese banks entered the market to sell American exchange at 5.5 yuan, and HSBC absorbed the first ling for 2 shillings 62222, from Chinese merchant speculators. The silver balance tax announced by HSBC remained low at 0.50%. After this, it was difficult to see the rise and fall in the market during the fluctuation. Around 11 o'clock, rumors of positive factors such as the landing of the Japanese army on the coast spread in the market. At that time, there were many settlements of accounts by foreign firms, which caused the potential to soften. The Chinese merchant speculators first bought August American exchange at 5.46875 yuan. Subsequently, foreign firms absorbed August American exchange from foreign exchange at 5.46875 yuan, making it reach 4375, and continued to buy August American exchange from foreign exchange, even softening to 5.40625 yuan. Before the noon close, speculators and British foreign exchange were favorable to eat and enter August American exchange, all at 5.40625 yuan. The closing price of British gold was 3 shillings and 59375, and the American exchange rate was 5.40625 yuan, which was 03125 and 0625 tighter than the morning opening of British and American currencies.

Renewed Efforts in the Afternoon

In the afternoon, the upward trend continued, and speculators rushed to buy a very large amount of American exchange, planning to enter the September American exchange at a price of 5.75 yuan, and August American exchange from 5.40625 yuan, reaching 375 yuan. There were surprisingly few sellers in the market, but it was still quiet before the closing. The evening closing price for British gold was 3 shillings and 59375, and the American exchange rate was 5.34375 yuan. The September British gold was 3 shillings and 578125, and the American exchange rate was 5.3125 yuan, which was 03125 less than the previous day's British gold spot and futures, the American exchange spot tightened .125, and the futures softened .0625.

### Hong Kong Funds Move to Shanghai, Gold Market’s Momentum is Aggressive, Surging Straight Through the 6,000 Yuan Barrier

Yesterday, the cash gold open market situation saw sharp gains, exceeding the 6,000 yuan mark. With strong upward sentiment and speculators eagerly pursuing gold, a gold rush is inevitable, creating a trend of easy rise and difficult fall. This is due to: (1) Rumors of Japanese troops landing on the coast, leading to warfare; (2) A considerable amount of Hong Kong capital moving here, with Hong Kong interests secretly buying in advance, followed by gold and silver firms and bullish companies, further boosted by retail investors aggressively pushing up prices; (3) Foreign exchange rates closely following, supporting the market price, leading to a unified upward sentiment. The market started relatively calm in the morning, opening at 5,830 yuan. After briefly seeing 5,825 yuan, market sentiment suddenly improved, sparking buying interest due to favorable rumors for the bullish side. Foreign exchange rates tightened, causing the price to soar past 5,900 yuan. In the afternoon, securities firms also stopped selling and started buying, jumping past 6,000 yuan and rising to a closing price of 6,045 yuan, a further increase of 207 yuan. Based on the US dollar exchange rate of 5.34375, the price was 6,520 yuan, a premium of over 500 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was around 5,000 taels. Ornamental gold rose by 20 yuan, reaching 620 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained stable.

Gold Price Surges Over 200 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) started calmly. Securities firms initially offered silver firms ten taels at 5,830 yuan, down slightly by eight yuan from the previous close. It then dropped another five yuan as gold firms offered money exchangers twenty taels at a lower price of 5,825 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms and money exchangers bought in. Although a certain silver firm tried to sell in the middle, bullish sentiment among retail investors was strong, causing a rise of over twenty yuan. Money exchangers bought from silver firms ten taels at 5,850 yuan. Later, with fewer buyers and a certain silver firm continuing to sell, the price retreated to 5,835 yuan. The trend shifted upwards again due to gold firms returning to search for purchases, hovering at 5,8670 yuan. Suddenly, there were rumors of a tense situation in Vietnam, and the foreign exchange market also weakened. This intensified buying interest, with silver and gold firms aggressively buying, breaking through the 5,900 yuan barrier. Gold firms bought thirty taels from silver firms at a high price of 5,930 yuan. At that time, retail investors took profits, and money exchangers also sold, leading to a temporary setback to 5,905 yuan. However, because sentiment remained strong and buyers saw the price dip, they resumed activity, while a certain silver firm was forced to cover a large number of short positions, leading to a high of 5,955 yuan before closing. The closing price retreated slightly, reaching 5,943 yuan. In the afternoon, due to tight foreign exchange rates, the market opened with a jump of 27 yuan, with silver firms buying twenty taels from securities firms at 5,970 yuan. Subsequently, due to strong buying interest from gold firms and some buying from securities firms, the price rose another 25 yuan, with securities firms buying thirty taels from money exchangers at 5,995 yuan. Afterward, silver firms took profits on their bullish positions, causing a temporary reversal, falling to 5,945 yuan. However, as the bullish positions were cleared and the tight foreign exchange situation persisted, buying interest revived soon after. Securities and silver firms competed to buy, breaking through the 6,000 yuan barrier. Old short sellers also painfully closed their positions, causing the price to soar to 6,040 yuan. Later, money exchangers sold, causing a pullback of 30 yuan. However, because gold firms continued to search for purchases, the market closed at a high of 6,045 yuan, a gain of 207 yuan from the previous day. The market has risen for four consecutive days, for a total increase of 365 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 220 yuan. After the close, the market retreated slightly, with the late evening price falling by ten yuan. There were no buyers. The selling price of cash gold by gold firms is higher by a dozen yuan compared to the open market, while the buying price is lower by 30 yuan. Current margin gold is over 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with little activity.

Silver Shops List Ornamental Gold at High Prices

The initial selling price of ornamental gold per tael at silver shops remained at 600 yuan at the major shops. At 11:30 AM, it was raised by ten yuan. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, it was raised another ten yuan. As a result, the major shops revised the price to 620 yuan. New shops listed the same price. The buying price was lowered by about 30 yuan.

### US Dollar Notes Sharply Rise by Forty Cents

Yesterday, in the foreign currency market, after Hong Kong interests and a certain Chinese bank searched for US dollar notes, the market price broke through the 6,000 yuan barrier. Supported by this, the prices of British and American gold pounds surged by five yuan. British gold notes were still being traded, with the price rising by fifty cents. US dollar notes rose to a high of 18.56 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 18.52 yuan, up forty cents from the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose slightly by one cent. Demand for Japanese gold notes increased, reaching 1.05 yuan in the evening market. Demand for Korean notes suddenly appeared, reaching 1.10 yuan in the evening market.

### Grains: Ample Rice Reserves, New Rice Arriving, Vietnam Rumors Stir the Rice Market, Speculation Manipulates Prices Above Evaluation, Temporary Market Closure Still Allows Price Increases and Hoarding

Since the rumor of the suspension of rice shipments from Hong Kong and Vietnam to Shanghai arose, due to the alleged closure of Vietnamese ports, speculative merchants saw an opportunity and engaged in major manipulation. This caused chaos in the market, with prices exceeding evaluation. The Market Management Committee, witnessing the situation, was unable to control it and immediately rang the bell to halt trading. This occurred at only 10:00 AM. A meeting was convened in the afternoon to discuss solutions. The market will reopen today. The prices for Number One Saigon and Number One Siam remain at 59.5 yuan, Number Two Saigon at 57 yuan, Siam Wei at 56 yuan, Fire Grain at 59 yuan, Small Grain at 56 yuan, and Tokyo Sharp Tip at 52 yuan. Although the market is temporarily closed, sentiment remains upward. Original package English-Chinese Company Number Two Saigon is quoted at 66 yuan, then rising to 66.5 to 67 yuan, up three yuan from the previous week. Number Two Siam is quoted from 65.5 yuan to 66 yuan, with a difference of two to three yuan. This is because sellers are seizing the opportunity to hoard goods, while many speculators compete to raise prices and absorb supplies. In reality, the city has enough rice reserves to last for three months, and new rice from various regions will be launched on the market soon. There should be no unexpected problems with food for the people. Due to active hoarding, nearly 10,000 bags of present foreign rice were traded throughout the day, with prices secretly increasing by one to two yuan. There were also 300 to 400 tons of original packages.

The arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice has been disrupted, and the foreign rice market is in disarray. Most sellers have strong sentiment, causing prices to rise sharply by one to one and a half yuan. Changbang fresh clear japonica rice has returned to the 70 yuan mark. Changzhou Su Kun japonica rice is at 67 to 68 yuan, down to 64 to 65 yuan. Nanhang original package early rice is at 65 to 66 yuan, down to 62 yuan. Glutinous rice Jin Li special grade is at 64 yuan, Chang Dan goods at 62 to 63 yuan, Hong Kong special grade at 63 to 64 yuan, and general market at 61 to 62 yuan.

### Little Progress in Flour and Wheat

There has been little progress in the flour market. Retail sales of Hua Factory Flour Old Car and Fuxin Brand are still decent, but wholesale sales have been stagnant for a long time, with no bulk shipments. This is due to transportation obstacles and the dumping of domestic and foreign flour. It is difficult to expect market development. Therefore, factory prices have been stable at the original price of 15 yuan, with retail prices also around 15.1 yuan. The Japanese factory flour Green Phoenix, which had previously risen once, is now relatively quiet due to the approaching end of the month and sufficient supply. Prices for this month are 14.5 yuan, September 14.7 yuan, and October 14.9 yuan, down five cents to one cent from the previous day. Total flour sales throughout the city were no more than 6,000 to 7,000 bags.

The wheat market remains quiet. For Hua Factory, formal transactions have been suspended for a long time due to difficulties in transporting goods into the concession. For Japanese factories, both foreign and domestic wheat have been purchased. Therefore, they are not greedy for more purchases, and daily trading has decreased to 2,000 to 3,000 bags, mostly priced after delivery to the factory. The market situation continues to be flat.

### Securities: Strong Demand for Domestic Bonds, Foreign Stocks Rise Again, Loose Credit is One Reason

The over-the-counter securities market saw stronger gains yesterday afternoon. The strong market sentiment and eager absorption by large investors were increasingly exciting, pushing prices to new highs since the dividend payment. The prices are almost on par with the highest price of the July 16th and 17th linked dividend payment. The rapid gains triggered profit-taking in the afternoon, causing a slight pullback. This is a normal fluctuation in the upward trend, and a decline in the future is unlikely. Yesterday, numbers 14 and 16 saw extremely strong buying interest in the morning. There was demand for Hongda, Jiufeng, Lianyi, Yichang, and Hengfu. Although Shunchang, Lianhe, Lemao, Yitai, and Zhongxin provided supplies, they could not satisfy the demand. Class C reached a high of 52.3 yuan, setting a new high after the dividend payment. The price slightly softened in the afternoon as profit-taking occurred. Shunchang, Jiufeng, Tiansheng, Zhongxin, Yichang, Tongxing, and Xie Da sold, and prices gradually declined. However, numbers 14 and 16 continued to absorb, Lianyi and Hengfu increased their positions, and Xinchang and Shengda also bought in. However, prices had already fallen slightly by three to four cents. The final price was still up by one to three cents. The total transaction volume was over 1.3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock trading: 30 shares of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory stock were traded at a price of 16.5 yuan.

The stock market at the Public Companies Association opened firm and progressed steadily. Although many took profits, it had no impact on the upward trend. The buying sentiment was exceptionally strong at the close. Apart from high prices, there were few sellers for each stock. All industrial stocks and rubber stocks rose amid the bullish market. Trust company stocks were particularly active. Xiangtai Lumber and Wheelock stocks rose the most sharply. The former rose from an opening price of 42.25 yuan to 46.5 yuan, while the latter closed at 72 yuan with buyers. "Loose credit" is likely the main reason for the rising market. If so, prices in the coming days should be even higher.

London, 28th (Wednesday) Telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks saw slight fluctuations in paper pound stocks. Mercantile Bank stocks rose by one shilling and three pence, to a price of six pounds and five shillings. Kurau Rubber stocks fell by three pence, to a price of thirteen shillings and nine pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Coarse Yarn Sales to Guangdong are Still Good

The yarn market started weak but then rose. However, actual sales, except for some demand from Hong Kong interests, were sluggish due to transportation obstacles affecting other regions. Only the Guangdong interests had a strong demand for 2-3 count and 10-count coarse yarn. Other 20-count yarn, such as Jincheng and Tiannv, were only purchased in small quantities. Therefore, sentiment varies. The current yarn market is in a situation of selling on the rise and buying on the fall, which is relatively cheaper.

The spot yarn market opened this morning continuing the floating atmosphere of the previous day. In addition, with reports that the Saigon-Haiphong-Shanghai shipping route has been suspended, sentiment was depressed. 20-count Double Horse was quoted at 963 yuan. As soon as this price was announced, sellers flocked. It soon dropped to 950 yuan, hovering at this price for a long time. Later, short sellers took profits and covered their positions, and the price rose back to 961 yuan at the close. But as the price rose, there were fewer new buyers. After the close, news of rising gold prices spread, driving sentiment and the price rose another seven to eight yuan. It is estimated that 2,190 bales were traded during the half-day. The 20-count Double Horse price fell by nine yuan. The amount purchased by each region is listed below: Local: 1,780, Hong Kong: 420, Wenzhou: 10. Total: 2,190.

### Manufacturers Wait and See, Cotton Sales Remain Difficult to Develop

Due to the continued contraction of foreign exchange rates, sentiment in the cotton market has improved slightly, but actual consumption remains normal. Chinese factories, due to sufficient purchases and storage in the past, have slow consumption. Therefore, there is no capacity for significant development in the short term. However, transactions between local traders are more active.

Regarding foreign cotton prices, the New York cotton market was active from the morning. Later, due to the strong performance of Wall Street stock prices and purchases by some speculators, the closing price was up five to six points from the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by three rupees yesterday.

The trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been lively recently, but it has all been by Japanese factories. Chinese factories still hold a wait-and-see attitude, fearing further changes in the situation. However, the market inventory is decreasing daily, especially for long-fiber cotton. Therefore, sentiment among traders is generally high.

### Piece Goods: "Removal Permits" Cause Problems, Shipping on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line is Halted

The cloth market first fell and then rose. Initially, prices were soft due to the carryover of the previous day's weakness and falling yarn prices. Transactions were also slow. However, gold prices rose later, rumors spread in the afternoon, and the gold rally intensified, driving sentiment among traders and triggering covering transactions. However, transactions were not strong due to sellers raising prices. A total of about 300 pieces were traded. Customers from Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong only added small quantities. Hong Kong buyers were more active, trading over 200 pieces of twill and colored cloth. Local wholesalers saw a sharp decline in purchases due to problems with "removal permits" on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, which led to the suspension of freight.

Yesterday, the Eastern Cloth market saw speculators and sentiment traders buying in again due to the tight foreign exchange rates and rising gold prices. The market gradually rose. White goods, led by fine cloth, opened at 31.75 yuan in the morning, rising to 32.4 yuan by noon. Fellow traders covered positions in the afternoon, intensifying buying interest and the price continued to rise by four to five cents. The closing price was 32.9 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge was at nine cents and four points. This is because the exchange opened a large amount of futures for the next month, and the prices were quite cheap. Therefore, the surge market in serge was not as strong as the surge in fine cloth.

### Oil Cakes: Floating Hoards Dumped, Futures Oil Fell Back

Yesterday's raw soybean oil market saw a unanimous surge at the start due to the tight situation of the previous day. But prices were high and buying interest was flat. The sentiment of the general floating hoarders wavered. The spot market was not significantly affected. The market price was temporarily stable and the overall trend did not deviate from rotation. But futures chips were abundant. The market had a tendency to fall instead of rise. Floating households inevitably fought for their positions. The overall situation will follow this downward trend, which is not surprising. Total transactions included 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at a price of 65 yuan original package. 150 pieces of September upper delivery at 62 to 63 yuan, 250 pieces of September lower delivery at 62.5 to 61.5 yuan, 550 pieces of October upper delivery at 63 to 61.5 yuan, 100 pieces of October lower delivery at 61.5 yuan, and 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at 91 yuan original package. Soybean oil opening for trade: 80 barrels of Dalian oil at 100.05 yuan, up half a yuan from the previous day, 50 barrels of Jiangbei oil at 96.5 yuan, and 300 dan of Dayou factory oil at 77.5 to 77 yuan, the old station order was 76 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Icing Sugar and Green Sugar Rose by Half a Yuan

Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable with little fluctuation. The Association's listed spot price for Grade 24 coarse white at the station was 77 yuan for new goods, 75.7 yuan for March old goods, 60.09 yuan for July customs station goods for transshipment, Dutch cotton white TML mark 74.6 yuan, up one cent. Dutch red 　mark spot 64 yuan, September 6 delivery 62.8 yuan, up three cents. Domestic sugar remains tight. Dongxiang red oil package 57 yuan, icing sugar green 73.5 yuan, both up half a yuan. 100 bags were traded. The Jianbang opened 500 bags of diao green at 64.5 yuan, settling at 63.8 yuan.

### Coal: Indian Coal Sold for 200 Yuan

The bituminous coal market was still flat. Traders in the street adopted a wait-and-see attitude, lacking wholesale transactions. Coal traders were also unwilling to lower prices for loose sales due to high costs. The situation was held steady. Indian bituminous coal was quoted at 200 yuan per ton for traders in cars, and 170 yuan for coal fines, with a handling fee added for delivery to customers.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: New Daylily from Daxing

Due to difficulties in obtaining supplies, ten pieces of Daxing daylily, transported by civilian ships, arrived only recently. Samples were already seen yesterday. The strips are relatively thick, and the color is good. Because it was the first time new goods were seen, Guangdong and Hong Kong traders immediately purchased them, and the price was over ten yuan higher than ordinary goods.

### Officially New Dried Lily Bulbs Arrive in Shanghai

Previous arrivals of dried lily bulbs were still considered freshly harvested goods. Yesterday marked the arrival of the first officially new stock, totaling twenty-nine packages. According to the client, this year's production is not abundant, leading to higher costs. They will wait for samples to be opened and inspected to determine an accurate market price.

Old News Re-copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (491) (See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)

### Western Scholars on the Book of Documents

The Four Books and Five Classics of China were translated into Western languages by Western scholars decades ago, with thorough attention to every detail. Some who doubted it argued that Yao and Shun lived more than 2,300 years before Jesus, making it over 4,200 years ago, thus the Canon of Yao and the Canon of Shun might be forgeries by later generations. This claim was taken as true by many who lacked understanding. However, astronomical experts who could predict the paths of the sun and moon, even thousands of years into the future, and could draw charts, took the records of the solstices and equinoxes in the Canon of Yao and compared them to the degrees of the stars in recent years, and also verified the degrees of the sun and moon in recent years to determine how much they differed over four thousand years. They discovered that the records in the Canon of Yao were indeed degrees from four thousand years ago. At that time, the Chinese had not yet understood the method of prediction, so even if they wanted to forge it, they could not have matched it so perfectly. Once this argument was made, everyone agreed!

Switching to Kerosene

Foreign kerosene sold in China is cheaper and of better quality than Chinese oil. Therefore, in addition to sales by foreign trading firms, there are also specialized shops established in various alleys, with a foreign lamp hanging at the entrance, emitting bright light at night. However, kerosene lamps have not yet become widely popular. Those who use them often make candle-like devices out of tin, hollowing them out to use instead, almost making their own lamps. However, the smell of the oil is unpleasant, so there are still many who continue to use Chinese oil.

Life Report

### "Shanghai Guest"

— By Zi Xin

We are specialized representatives dispatched from department stores in other provinces, coming to Shanghai from thousands of miles away, residing within customs brokerages, specializing in handling goods produced in various regions, and sending them to the stores for sale. This is what is known as a "Shanghai Guest."

Since we are "guests" here, the place where we live naturally cannot be spacious, especially within a customs brokerage. At most, there is one room, one for bookkeeping, and one for a bedroom. At the entrance hangs a signboard with the name and number of a certain place, so people know at a glance that this is a "representative office" from another province. We call this "representative office" a "Shanghai Office" or a "Shen Office." An ordinary "Shanghai Office" has only one person, but those with more work have two or three people.

Generally, those who work as "Shanghai Guests" here can enjoy special treatment. For example, for clothing, there is an "clothing allowance" every year. Entertaining guests, watching movies, eating at restaurants, etc., these are legitimate expenses and are naturally "company expenses." Even improper "socializing" can be taken from public funds. However, if such terms were written directly in the accounts, it would seem too unrefined, so we have a traditional practice of giving it the euphemistic name "rouge expenses," which looks better in the accounts. Other expenses such as "cigarette account" and "car fare" can be filled out at will. Sir, do not think that we are tampering with the accounts. In fact, they are all "company expenses" related to socializing, but the wording used must be slightly more elegant. The main store is, of course, well aware of these situations, but mostly adopts a "don't ask about small matters if there are no big problems" attitude. As long as you do not engage in any other out-of-bounds behavior, it can be easily explained away. Shanghai is, after all, a special place, and "guests" who come to stay naturally have some special socializing, and this expense is unavoidable for any "Shanghai Office." Especially since the talent of a "Shanghai Guest" seems to be a mantle passed down from a single master, and the way things are done is invariably the same.

Speaking of our work, it is very comfortable. When buying goods, just say a word to the runners. Minor matters can be handed over to the tea servant we bring with us, so we don't have to worry. However, we have one very important job, which is writing "numbered letters." Whether there is something to say or not, we must send them on the due dates. It is best to write lengthy "numbered letters," and if there is nothing to say, we must still think of something to say, because this way, the store will say that you are diligent in your work, that you write letters in great detail, and that it can prove that this "Shanghai Guest" is a capable and virtuous person. Even if there are some errors elsewhere, it will not be a problem.

Besides our work, the only thing we do is play mahjong. Whether it is day or night, the sound of banging tiles is endless. If we are not in the mood to play mahjong, we can just go outside and roam around, doing whatever we please. In short, we are very carefree and comfortable, not like businessmen at all, simply living like carefree kings. However, it is precisely because we are too free and too casual that some "Shanghai Guests" among us lose control, and unknowingly fall into depravity, ending up either contracting "foreign diseases" or embezzling large amounts of public funds. In the end, they can only pack their bags and go home, waiting for investigation. Therefore, someone gave us the slogan: "Ten out of ten 'Shanghai Guests' end up ruined." Indeed, "Shanghai Guests" seem to be a very enjoyable and lucrative job on the surface, but in reality, it is very dangerous, with pitfalls everywhere. If your will is not firm, you are sure to fall into the quicksand one day and never be able to recover.

The above "Shanghai Guest" refers entirely to the general situation of our "local group." As for how things are for the "other groups," that is unknown.

### Madman

— Zhou Tianlu

It was just past eight in the morning, time to go to the office as usual, when the old nanny from the parlor suddenly came into my bedroom and whispered in my ear mysteriously, "Do you know? The big woman next door's husband has turned into a madman. If you don't believe me, go and take a look. His clothes are as filthy as a bum on the street, and his face is dark. Compared to before…" As she said this, she heard the children arguing and making noise in the parlor and hurriedly left. As she left, she gestured, meaning I should go and see for myself and not miss the opportunity.

Knowing full well that it was getting late and I couldn't linger any longer, I was nonetheless driven by curiosity and went to take a look.

The madman—the big woman's husband—was sitting on a long bench by the door, muttering something, but no one could understand what he was saying. Suddenly, he widened his pitiful, vacant eyes and glared at me, then began to sob as if weeping, and then he shouted, "Why was I born to be a man! Why was I born to be a man!" Just as I was about to turn back inside, the old nanny appeared before me again, indicating that she hadn't deceived me. She took her youngest grandson and followed behind me, scolding the big woman harshly for being conscienceless and openly having affairs, staying out for several nights.

With heavy steps, I walked down the street towards the office, my head feeling slightly swollen. The appearance and behavior of the madman I had just seen replayed in my mind, reminding me of almost forgotten past events.

The big woman and her husband, though our neighbors, had never greeted each other. All I knew was that the husband had recently lost his job and was staying at home, and the woman had previously worked as a worker in a cotton mill in Hongxi, and was now also at home. The woman's appearance wasn't particularly beautiful; the neighbors called her "Big Woman" to describe her robust physique. She looked to be about forty-four or forty-five years old, while the man was shorter but quite sturdy. This was known to all the neighbors.

A week ago, one evening, we were all enjoying the cool air at the back door when a commotion broke out in front. The noise quickly entered the ears of those sitting at the back door, but everyone remained seated as if they hadn't heard anything. Marital quarrels, or arguments over trivial matters, were considered commonplace, so few people paid attention. Just then, the daughter of the second landlord next door came out, and we realized: it was the Big Woman arguing with her husband again. Next door lived a young couple. The man never sought employment and relied entirely on the woman's earnings from a tourist agency to cover expenses, eating well, dressing well, and having plenty of money. The Big Woman, seeing this, couldn't help but feel envious, so she pleaded and lobbied in various ways, eventually getting her wish. However, the husband consistently objected, telling the neighbors that he would never allow his wife to become a tourist guide, preferring to starve to death. The next day, someone told me that the Big Woman's husband was now a fruit vendor, and I felt pleased to hear it. Three days later, someone else said that the Big Woman's husband had really bad luck and had lost all the five yuan he borrowed for capital! Now, the Big Woman was determined to join the tourist agency, but the husband still refused to agree…

### Quick Sketch of British Troops Embarking

— Lao Wang

The British garrison in Shanghai has withdrawn in four batches since it began. Newspapers have detailed the enthusiastic welcome from Chinese and foreign residents lining Nanjing Road as each batch passed through on their way to the ship. However, few know what happens at the Gonghexiang Wharf, firstly because the wharf is in a "restricted area" and secondly because the gate is immediately closed after the British troops enter. Only those with special passes are allowed inside. I was able to enter for work and will share what I saw with the readers.

I arrived at the wharf around 1:15 PM. Three lines of Western and Indian police officers and many Japanese police officers stood at the entrance. Chinese and foreign residents stood on both sides of the road, mostly White Russian girls, probably meeting their foreign lovers for the last time. When I entered, I showed my company pass, and the gatekeeper readily let me in. At the wharf, I saw the Jardine Matheson's Hao Sheng Lun docked, smoke billowing, getting ready to depart. Military equipment, baggage, blankets, cages, boxes, etc., were piled on both sides of the wharf. An officer directed soldiers to move the luggage. Several British soldiers stood guard around the wharf, armed to the teeth, preventing anyone from approaching. Around 1:45 PM, the sound of military music gradually grew louder, and in an instant, the spirited British troops marched into the wharf in neat formation, numbering six hundred, divided into five platoons, each led by an officer. Upon reaching the wharf, the officer gave some brief instructions, probably regarding preparations for boarding, what clothes to wear, etc., and then called out a rest order. The soldiers stacked their rifles in a triangle, removed the bullets, took off their skirts and changed into shorts, then took out tags, wrote their names, numbers, and platoon numbers on them, and attached them to their rifles and knapsacks. Helmets and ammunition clips were placed to the right of their feet, and knapsacks and skirts behind their feet. They had a fixed position for each item, all uniform across the platoon. After everyone was ready, the officer ordered them to hand in their rifles. Rifles were handed from the first person in each row to the second, then from the second to the third, and the last person stood at the middle hatch of the Hao Sheng Lun, which was the rifle storage. Two or three soldiers inside received the weapons, and all the rifles were handed in in less than a quarter of an hour. Then each person carried one piece of luggage onto the ship, then returned to carry the second, and finally took their helmet and skirt onto the ship. Once on board, they didn't come out again. They lived as a platoon, so one platoon carried this, and another platoon carried that, all in order and without confusion. In less than two hours, all the soldiers were on board, and around 4 PM, the ship gradually left the port to the sound of military music, bidding farewell to the isolated islanders.

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 6: A Dangerous Experience

"Now I'll tell you about the fact that you committed the crime: Wang Lilan was beaten to death at about 1:15 AM on the night of the 18th. On the morning of the 18th, you made a phone call to Wang Lilan, clearly denouncing her for going to the Yadong Hotel on the night of the 16th. You even expressed your intention to murder her at the time. Is that correct?"

Yu Gantang, as usual, didn't reply, but his body kept twitching, looking even more huddled and uneasy.

Ni Jinshou continued, "Yesterday—the 18th—around 7 PM in the evening, you went to her house again to ask the gatekeeper about her whereabouts. Wang Lilan had already gone out at that time. You probably waited until she came back in the middle of the night before you made your move. Because you returned to the dormitory close to 12:30 AM, and then went out again once. You certainly didn't sleep soundly that night. This morning—the 19th—early in the morning, you went to Qingpu Road again, clearly wanting to see if your actions last night had been successful. At that time, Wang Lilan's body was just being carried onto the hearse. You uncovered the sheet covering the body, took a look, knew that your purpose had been achieved, and hurriedly fled. As for you going to Yadong just now to look for Zhao Boxiong, you clearly intended to go all the way and kill your love rival. Is that correct?"

Yu Gantang's expression changed drastically! He slightly raised his head, his lips trembling slightly, as if he wanted to say something, but couldn't get it out. Then his head sank again, and his two hands supported the edges of the chair, as if he wanted to stand up, but couldn't stand up in the end.

Ni Jinshou looked at the young man's expression, and said with a cold smile, "Am I wronging you? Are these things all fabricated? Say something."

The young man seemed to muster his courage, straightened his spine, and propped up his heavy head. He glanced at Ni Jinshou, a look of surprise, anger, and resentment on his face, simply indescribable. In an instant, his head sank again, and he finally couldn't say a word. Seeing him in this state, I suddenly felt an inappropriate pity. A young man who was clearly intelligent and promising, why did he throw himself into this dark pit? Ni Jinshou sneered again, and said, "You still refuse to speak? Then—" (91)

### Announcement of the Fun Test Results

(1)

The Fun Test organized by this publication has received enthusiastic responses from readers since its publication on the 24th. The average number of letters received each day exceeded four thousand, with a total of 13,264 letters within three days. The film fans' love for movies is evident. At 9:00 AM on the 27th, the General Management Office of this newspaper handed over all the letters to the editor, instructing all colleagues in the Special Promotion Department to carry out the vote counting. It took two days of effort to complete all the procedures clearly. The post office reported that after the deadline of the 26th, letters continued to arrive like snowflakes, so they had to be excluded. We ask those who arrived late to forgive us.

(2)

According to the results of our vote counting, there were 6,472 people who correctly identified "Mei Lin," and 6,792 people who did not. Among them, the film stars who were identified totaled as many as 74. If readers study it carefully, they will definitely chuckle.

The original quota for those who guessed correctly was limited to 20 people, each receiving a one-month subscription to this newspaper. However, the number of people who guessed correctly exceeded expectations. This newspaper believes that this is an excellent phenomenon. If the quota is too small, it would be a disservice to the enthusiasm of most loyal readers. Therefore, it is specially approved to increase the prize quota to 100, using a one-month subscription to this newspaper as a reward. The method is to randomly draw 100 tickets from the 6,472 tickets, with one subscription for every 64 people. The remaining 6,372 unsuccessful people will be randomly selected, with 2,000 people (one in every 1-2 people winning a prize). Each person will receive two "Shen Bao Commemorative Pencils" as a special gift, delivered by special delivery. This is the final, preferential measure. Although the cost to this newspaper is substantial, I think it will provide readers with great spiritual comfort.

The reason why this publication chose Ms. Mei Lin as the test subject is twofold: First, Ms. Mei's face is similar to that of the late star Ruan Lingyu, in order to test the readers' "ability to recognize." Second, Ms. Mei has been away from the film industry for many years, separated from film fans for a long time, in order to test the readers' "memory." Third, in recent years, domestic films have become increasingly developed, which shows the "faith" of people who have always loved watching movies in domestic films. As a result of this test, we know that the general public's impression of each film star is already very deep, and of course, they love domestic films.

### Loretta Young Announces Marriage

— Hui Cun

Seventeen-Year-Old First Love

Loretta Young recently married New York advertising executive Tom Lewis again. This piece of good news doesn't make Hollywood people pay much attention, because she has married people too many times in the past. Loretta Young is only twenty-eight years old this year, however, she had a romance ten years ago, when she was seventeen years old. When she met her first man named Garunt Withers, she fell in love and got married. But after a year, they separated.

Most Painful Heartbreak

In the seven years after that, she had many romances, and met many handsome men, but none of them had happy endings. Either she abandoned him, or he forgot her. During that period, she seemed to treat love between men and women as child's play, and never had a dedicated will. Seven years later, she met William Buckner, and thought he was the only lover in her heart. Yes, she didn't feel much nostalgia for the men she had met in the past, but she was reluctant to leave Buckner. However, good times don't last long. Buckner soon fell in love with the socialite Addie Moffet. The two finally got married, leaving Loretta Young aside. This made her deeply feel the pain of being heartbroken. After being stimulated by this, she resented love. For a long time, she didn't think about love.

Satisfied Union

However, people are not made of wood or stone, who can forget their feelings? She finally couldn't suppress the desire for love in her heart, and couldn't care about the deep stimulation she had received, and the pain was still there, but she began to be active in the circle of love again. Soon, her wish came true, and she found a new target, he is the New York advertising executive Tom Lewis who married her this time. The reason why she loves him is mostly because she covets his wealthy assets. As for love, it is also very good at present.

The wedding was held at Good Shepherd Church in Beverly Hills. On the wedding day, Loretta Young was very happy. She thought this should be the most satisfactory union. However, Hollywood people can't imagine her future.

### Ms. Mei Lin's Film History

(Attached letter)

Dear Editor: I have been away from the film industry for many years, and now I am enjoying a happy family life. I didn't expect that the Shen Bao would publish my photos today as a fun test. I am very happy to receive the love of ladies from all walks of life. It is really an honor in my life! Thank you. Best regards, Mei Lin, 28th of August.

Ms. Mei Lin's Brief History Of course, more than 13,000 readers who responded this time have seen Ms. Mei Lin's graceful appearance on the screen many times. The editor adds it again to increase your interest, or it is not superfluous. Ms. Mei Lin's original name was Pan Zhaolin. She is from Wuxing, Zhejiang. She is twenty-six years old this year. She graduated from the junior high school of Wuxing Shanghai Public School, and then went to Moore Hall to specialize in Chinese and English, with deep attainments. Because she loved movies, she joined the former Lianhua Film Company. During the three years, she participated in famous films such as "Carefree Gentleman", "Mother's Love", "Family", and "Symphony". The lady's appearance is very similar to the late star Ruan Lingyu. The Lianhua Company stopped operating when the "August 13" War broke out. Xinhua Company had signed a three-year contract with her, but it failed to fulfill it due to the war. Soon, she married Yan Youling, a famous doctor in Shanghai, and had a daughter who was only two years old.

### Li Qinian Returns to Hong Kong in Mid-September

— Hai Xing

Li Qinian originally planned to star in one modern and one costume film during this visit to Shanghai, but now that "Liang Hongyu" and "Empress Wu" are both costume films, the Art China authorities plan to invite her to continue to star in a modern film due to the good relationship between the host and the guest. However, Li Qinian has two unfinished works in Hong Kong, so it is inconvenient for her to stay in Shanghai for a long time. She will return to the south next month, or come again next spring to cooperate with Art China.

Also: "Empress Wu" has been completed and will be released on the 11th of September.
