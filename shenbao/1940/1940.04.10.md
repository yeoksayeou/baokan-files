### 20,000 Danish Soldiers Not Enough to Mobilize, Norwegian Fleet Concentrates, Awaits Orders

London - Reuters has learned that when Germany began its invasion, Jutland housed Danish troops. The total number of troops throughout Denmark did not exceed 25,000. If the Danes had sufficient time to mobilize, they could have mustered 100,000 men, but Germany's "blitzkrieg strategy" gave them no chance. (Reuters, 9th)

London - According to reports from Rome, Italian radio stations have broadcast news stating that the Norwegian fleet has been ordered to concentrate in the port of Narvik and await orders. (Havas, 8th)

### All of Denmark Controlled by German Forces, Norwegian Government Declares War on Germany, Germany Uses Blitzkrieg Strategy to Occupy Key Ports of Oslo, Norwegian Government Relocates to Hamar, Resolves to Resist with All its Might

London - The "blitzkrieg strategy" that Germany has long awaited has been realized today. The first to bear the brunt are Denmark and Norway on the Scandinavian Peninsula. German forces have invaded the two countries with lightning speed. At dawn today, less than 24 hours after Britain announced it had laid mines in three areas of Norwegian territorial waters, German forces crossed the border from land and entered Schleswig in the Jutland Peninsula of Denmark. At the same time, German transport ships carrying troops landed on the island of Zealand, where the Danish capital Copenhagen is located. Other German forces landed on the Norwegian coast and occupied Copenhagen at 8:00 AM, meeting no resistance. According to reports from Amsterdam, all of Denmark was effectively under German control by noon. Upon receiving news of German forces landing on its southern coast in the early morning, the Norwegian government issued a general mobilization order. It is now believed that the Norwegian capital Oslo has fallen. The Norwegian government has declared war on Germany and is preparing to resist with all its might. German forces met with slight resistance from Norwegian land batteries in the Oslofjord but have landed on the mainland. It is also reported that Oslo was bombed by air. Several towns along the Norwegian coast have been occupied. The Norwegian government has hurriedly moved from Oslo to Hamar. The Danish government is less fortunate; it is reported that after the fall of Copenhagen, it is entirely under German control. The British and French governments have assured the Norwegian government that they will provide full assistance. Britain and France have not yet taken action against Denmark because the Danish government has lost its freedom, and the Danish ambassador in London has not received instructions to negotiate with the British Foreign Office. According to Swedish radio announcements, the Swedish government has issued a general mobilization order, which has since been denied. German broadcasts claim that German forces have laid mines in the Skagerrak off the major Swedish ports. Since the German attacks on Denmark and Norway, telephone communications between the Scandinavian Peninsula and the rest of Europe have been cut off, so details of this sudden development have not been available. Only fragments of information have been transmitted. (Reuters, 9th)

The stronger the combat power, the better. British naval correspondents believe that Germany can muster a maximum of 30 warships on the surface of the sea, but the British navy is more than capable of dealing with them and destroying them. (United Press, 9th)

Editorial

### Serious Development of the European War

The European war originally had two possible developments. Now, because the neutrality of Norway has become an issue, the flames will first spread to the Scandinavian Peninsula, marking the beginning of the second phase of the European war. This was the conclusion of this newspaper yesterday, but it was unexpected that it would materialize so quickly. At 5:30 AM yesterday, Germany, using a blitzkrieg strategy, dispatched naval, land, and air forces to suddenly attack Norway and Denmark. As of last night, it is known that in Norway, although German forces encountered some local resistance, they had already occupied the Norwegian capital and several key ports. In Denmark, due to the Danish government's decision not to resist, Germany has virtually occupied the entire country.

The offensive taken by Germany this time clearly demonstrates the soundness of German organization, the strength of its forces, the vigor of its command, and the agility of its actions. Although the overall outcome and the righteousness of this move are subject to further discussion, its advantages are evident and undeniable.

The fall of Denmark without resistance, happening virtually overnight, makes people directly recognize the value and necessity of resistance. There is no better comparison: Finland, outnumbered, resisted for over a hundred days and was ultimately able to negotiate peace with the Soviet Union on equal terms, preserving its national independence and freedom. China, weaker than its opponent, has resisted for over a thousand days and has finally laid the foundation for ultimate victory.

As for Norway, its capital has fallen, its key ports have been lost, and enemy forces have entered directly. However, it is not willing to surrender and be slaughtered. It is also fulfilling its inherent mission of defending the country and fighting for survival. It is relocating its capital and issuing a general mobilization order. Past events are often unbearable to recall! Since Britain, France, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Finland have successively engaged in war, Norway has cautiously sought what it believed to be the best course of action: it cannot be said that it was not cold towards Finland; it cannot be said that it was not accommodating towards Germany; it cannot be said that it was not serious towards Britain and France; it cannot be said that it was not sincere towards neutrality. However, it still cannot avoid falling into the furnace of war. We do not need to foolishly regret on its behalf, thinking that it should have acted differently in the past. It was united with Denmark from 1397 to 1814 and then separated; it was united with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 and then separated. As a fully independent nation, it has interacted with the international community for only thirty-five or six years. During that time, it experienced the historical lessons of the First World War, which led it to adopt the attitude it held until yesterday. What it began to experience yesterday is unprecedented in the history of Norwegian nationhood. In fact, Belgium in the First World War was a precedent for Norway.

Norway differs from Denmark in its determination to resist. The development and outcome of war differ from the cause-and-effect laws of natural science and are subject to endless changes. Germany is strong, Norway is weak; Germany has planned carefully and acted deliberately, while Norway is forced to respond hastily. However, unexpected miracles often occur. The Norwegian people, along with the Swedish and Finnish peoples, are recognized by other European nations as brave and fierce northerners. In the Middle Ages, they repeatedly moved south, attacking and conquering lands. As a result, the English and French had a historical prayer: "God, save us from the violent northerners!" This, combined with the courage and loyalty of Finland's recent resistance, shows that the northerners are still good at fighting. Moreover, Norway is full of towering mountains and ridges, so the outcome of the war is truly uncertain. However, being optimistic on its behalf would be too contrary to science. More to be observed is that the conflict between Germany and Norway is not an independent war but merely one aspect of the war between Germany and Britain and France. Germany has strong enemies in front of it and is also using troops in Norway. Besides military reasons for fighting against Britain and France, it is feared that economic reasons would outweigh the gains and not necessarily warrant such an expansion of the war. Since the reason is military strategy, it can be imagined that Britain and France will also act out of military necessity and will certainly not stand by and watch Norway bear the brunt alone. Therefore, it is a natural deduction that Britain and France, at least with their navy and air force, will do their best to cooperate with the Norwegian army on the ground.

The flames on the Scandinavian Peninsula only began in one corner of Norway yesterday, but the situation has already revealed to us: (1) the European war has indeed expanded and entered its second phase; (2) German military strategy lies in avoiding the strength of the Maginot Line and threatening the side of England itself; (3) the crisis in the Balkans is therefore ranked in a possible third round; (4) peace is remote; (5) intense fighting is imminent. We do not need to rush to make further inferences about this situation. What we should be concerned about in the next two or three days is how the news reports to us; how Britain and France will coordinate with Norway in military terms; how Sweden, which is a fraternal nation to Norway, will act; whether the Soviet Union, which has close ties with the Scandinavian Peninsula and the Baltic Sea, will stand by; whether the Netherlands and Belgium, of course, feel that their lips are cold because Denmark has died, will endure? At the same time, it is still necessary to pay attention to whether the countries centered on the Balkan issue, under this profound stimulus, will not quickly accelerate their "third round" of planning and circling.

### Chamberlain Announces in the House of Commons: Britain and France Assure Norway of Full Assistance; Powerful Naval Detachment Dispatched; Germany's Tyranny Will Surely Backfire

London – Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that Great Britain has resolved to provide Norway with full assistance. A powerful detachment of the British Navy has already been dispatched to sea. The entire House heard this and cheered loudly.

The Prime Minister spoke at length today, stating that as long as the land of the Scandinavian Peninsula was not attacked by Germany, the Allied nations never considered occupying any land on the peninsula. (Members of Parliament cheered again at this statement.) The opposite statements issued by Germany are purely fabrications and have no basis.

When the Prime Minister rose to speak, the atmosphere in the House was tense. There was not a single empty seat in the diplomatic gallery. The ambassadors of Spain, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Argentina, China, and the Norwegian Minister were all present as observers.

At the beginning of his speech, the Prime Minister announced that German troops had invaded Denmark and Norway today. He went on to say that since the outbreak of the war, Germany has been trying day and night to control Scandinavia and to direct the political and economic policies of the countries of the peninsula. The pressure exerted has been increasing daily. When the Soviet-Finnish War was in progress, Germany demanded the right to guide the policies of the countries of the peninsula toward Finland. When the Soviet-Finnish War ended, I said that the safety of Finland had been lost, but was the safety of Norway and Sweden preserved? Unexpectedly, the opposite happened, and the danger faced by the two countries became increasingly imminent, and today it has reached their doorstep. These countries have no way to protect themselves except to resolve to defend themselves and join the preparations to assist in resisting the enemy. At the time, many listeners thought that my words were exaggerated, but now we must see that the predictions made earlier have become facts, word for word. Since that day, the situation has continued to develop. The communique issued yesterday mentioned that the German government demanded the right to destroy Chinese ships, especially those of the Scandinavian countries, on the seas around Britain, while insisting that the countries strictly adhere to the rules of neutrality. The Allied nations decided that they could no longer tolerate this situation (the crowd cheered). They informed Norway that the British government reserved the right to implement necessary plans to remedy this imbalance. Britain has laid mines in Norwegian waters to prevent German ships from passing through, without interfering with Norway's normal trade in any way. As long as the land of the Scandinavian Peninsula was not attacked by Germany, the Allied nations never considered occupying any land on the peninsula. The opposite statements issued by Germany are purely fabrications and have no basis. The German government has now issued a statement saying that it has decided to take on the protection of Denmark and Norway (laughter erupted).

The Prime Minister then described the situation of the German invasion, saying that at dawn today, German mechanized units and armed forces crossed the Danish border and occupied a large area of Danish land. It is reported that German troops landed in Danzig this morning. The British government learned that the German Minister to Norway formally demanded Norway's surrender to Germany this morning, saying that if it refused, all resistance would be crushed. This demand was of course immediately rejected by the Norwegian government (the crowd cheered). We now hear that the war has begun, and it is also reported that Oslo and Kristiansand have been bombed, and German troops have landed in various parts of Norway. The German government claimed that the German troops' invasion of Norway was a retaliation for the Allied nations laying mines in Norwegian waters. This statement cannot deceive anyone (the crowd cheered). German troops landed simultaneously in several ports, aided by the Navy, which could not have been done hastily. This must have been planned long in advance before it could be launched. According to the information we have received, it clearly shows that this move was not only planned in advance, but was launched before the Allied nations laid the mines. What I said earlier, Germany has already proven by the fact of occupation. It is reported that the Norwegian port of Trondheim was attacked by German troops this morning, which is 700 miles from the closest German port of Cuxhaven. Even if German troops had immediately set out after the news of the Allied nations laying mines was announced, they would not have been able to arrive by now.

The British government immediately assured the Norwegian government that, in view of the German troops' invasion of Norway, the British government has resolved to provide full assistance immediately. British troops plan to cooperate with Norwegian troops in combat. At present, a powerful detachment of the British Navy has been dispatched to sea. The work that the British government is engaged in is for the public interest, and it is inconvenient to describe it in detail.

We are now cooperating very closely with the French government to deal with this new threat to the independence of free nations. I am confident that Germany's continued reckless and brutal acts of aggression will surely harm itself and contribute to its final defeat (the crowd cheered).

Labor Opposition Leader Attlee then rose to speak, expressing sympathy for the people of Denmark and Norway, and said that two of the most civilized countries in Europe are now being attacked by the most barbaric country. This invasion has clearly been prepared for a long time. This is another new incident of extreme barbaric aggression. I hope that the assistance given to Norway must be sufficient (the crowd cheered loudly) and must be rapid and effective (the crowd cheered). We must do everything in our power in time to prevent another five countries from being ravaged by the Nazi iron heel (the crowd cheered).

Liberal Opposition Leader Sinclair rose and declared that the Liberal Party was overwhelmed by the barbaric German attack on Denmark and Norway, and that Germany was trying to control them. The actions announced by the Prime Minister just now must be supported by the whole country. We hope that everything can be quick and effective. Liberal Party Member of Parliament Mandel mentioned immediately convening a meeting of the League of Nations and made some inquiries. The Prime Minister replied that he had heard that German troops had landed in Bergen, or were waiting for German troops to land in Narvik, but this statement was highly doubtful, because there was a place with the same name inside Norway. The Prime Minister continued that he dared to believe that the House of Commons would not rush to make a decision on the Navy's actions before we continued to receive news, and would not want to criticize the Navy's actions before the facts were clear. As for convening a meeting of the League of Nations, no one has yet proposed this matter. The first thing that should be done today is always the first thing to do, and there are many more effective actions than convening a meeting of the League of Nations. The Prime Minister also replied to another Member of Parliament's request to convene a meeting of the League of Nations, saying that he sincerely hoped that the member states of the League of Nations would fully recognize the obligations they owed to the invaded countries (Reuters News Agency, 9th).

### German Government's Note to Norway and Denmark Explains the Intention of the Invasion

Oslo – This morning, the German ministers to Norway and Denmark sent notes to the governments of the two countries, respectively. The contents of the notes are as follows: Britain and France have already declared war on the German people, and now they have begun to wage war on neutral countries. Britain and France disregard international law and regulations, initially planning to use blockade measures to make German women, children, and old people suffer from hunger, while the navigation and trade of neutral countries also suffer serious losses. The concept of neutrality has also been destroyed by Britain. Furthermore, although Germany has attempted to limit the area of naval warfare, Britain has attempted to shift the danger felt by the British Isles and gradually move the naval warfare into neutral territorial waters. In fact, Britain has repeatedly taken actions of a warlike nature in the territorial waters and airspace of Norway and Denmark, disregarding international law. Germany had anticipated this from the beginning of the war. Germany uses its economic policies to prevent Britain's various conspiracies from taking effect. The failure of Britain's blockade policy has been completely exposed in recent months. Britain's attack on Germany's fortresses has failed, while Germany has taken various counter-offensive measures against Britain and France at sea and in the air, causing Britain and France to suddenly have the intention of moving the battlefield to the territory of neutral countries. When the Soviet-Finnish War occurred, the British and French governments expressed their desire to intervene by force. Their purpose was to use the territory of the Nordic countries as a base for their activities, so as to cut off Germany's mineral resources. If Narvik were occupied by Britain and France, the northern minerals would be difficult to reach Germany. Unexpectedly, the Soviet-Finnish peace talks were very quick, and Britain and France's conspiracy failed to materialize. Britain has always had the ambition to use the people of the Nordic countries to fight for it. The German government has learned this thoroughly. After the Soviet-Finnish peace talks, the German government received information that Britain and France were attempting to achieve their goals under other pretexts. In the most recent week, the British and French governments publicly announced that this war may not allow the existence of neutrality, and that small countries should actively participate in the war against Germany. The German government has documents showing what Britain and France's intentions are to disregard the wishes of the Nordic countries and to force them to submit, and there is evidence that Britain and France plan to occupy the territory of the Nordic countries by surprise in the next few days. However, the Nordic countries have not taken measures to resist aggression. The German government has been watching very closely and is well aware that the military strength of Norway and Denmark is weak, and even if they want to resist, it will be of no avail. Now, at this critical moment, it cannot tolerate Britain and France realizing their conspiracy. Therefore, today it is taking military action and will occupy the military strongholds in the territory of Norway and Denmark. In this war, the German government will protect Norway and Denmark from British and French attacks.

The German government does not wish for things to develop in this way, but is forced to do so. The blame should be borne by the British. When German troops enter the territory of Norway and Denmark, they have no hostility towards the people of Norway and Denmark. Unless oppressed by British and French actions, the German military authorities do not intend to use the areas occupied by German troops as a base for operations.

The German government firmly believes that this move is also beneficial to Norway and Denmark. Therefore, it anticipates that the governments and people of Norway and Denmark will understand the purpose of Germany's actions and will not resist. If there is resistance, the German troops will take all measures to destroy it. The result will only be bloodshed and sacrifice, with no benefit. Therefore, it requests that the governments of Norway and Denmark take various measures as soon as possible, so that no friction or difficulties will occur when the German troops advance. The German government, based on the spirit of consistently harmonious diplomatic relations between the two sides, guarantees that Germany has no intention of infringing upon the territorial integrity and political independence of Norway and Denmark (Haitong News Agency, 9th).

### Violation of National Sovereignty: Norway Resolves Not to Yield

Oslo – This morning, the German Minister to Norway verbally and in writing requested that Norway not resist the German occupation. At 5 a.m., the German Minister said that Germany considered it necessary for Norway to be placed under German military protection. The Norwegian government then held a meeting to consider the situation and decided that it could not express submission to the German demands, as it violated Norway's sovereignty. According to Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht, the German Minister said that if Germany did not occupy Norway, the Allied nations would do so. Koht said that he had told the German Minister that he did not believe that the Allied nations had any such intention (Reuters News Agency, 9th).

### Norway's Note to Britain Protests the Violation of Neutrality

Oslo – The Norwegian government recently delivered a note to the ministers of Britain and France, stating that the governments of Britain and France have laid mines in three areas of the territorial sea of our country, in order to prevent free navigation, and several British warships are cruising in these areas. This action is clearly a public violation of international law and a violation of our country's sovereignty and neutrality by force. We hereby lodge a solemn protest. Since the outbreak of the war, our country has always strictly adhered to the various regulations of the allied neutral countries, without exceeding them in the slightest. Our government's permission for the legitimate commercial transport of various belligerent countries to freely pass through our country's territorial sea is fully in line with the generally accepted regulations. On the 12th of last month, the British government signed an agreement with our country, stipulating that our country's goods, including contraband, could still be sold and transported to Germany as usual. Now, Britain and France want to use force to stop this kind of transport, which is really beyond our country's expectations. In short, our country cannot accept the laying of mines by the belligerent countries in our country's territorial sea. Therefore, our government has to demand the removal of these mines and British warships, and reserves the right to take various appropriate measures to deal with them (Havas News Agency, 8th).

Oslo – Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht said in the Parliament last night that Norway's neutrality has been seriously violated today. He believed that the people of all neutral countries would be shocked when they heard this. The Allied nations' actions were right or wrong, and there was a public opinion on them. He did not need to criticize them harshly. He would now submit the Allied nations' documents to the Parliament, and the government would discuss with the Parliament the steps that Norway should take to safeguard its rights. Koht then reported on the notes delivered by Britain and France to Norway and Sweden on April 5, stating that the Allied governments understood the difficult position of the Norwegian and Swedish governments due to German threats and oppression, but had to come to a conclusion that in the current circumstances, the Norwegian and Swedish governments could not be regarded as free bodies in all circumstances. Germany could obtain important military supplies from Norway and Sweden. What was beneficial to Germany was harmful to the Allied nations. As things stood, the Allied governments could no longer tolerate it. Therefore, they felt that the time had come to clearly announce to the Norwegian and Swedish governments that the Allied governments would maintain certain necessary rights and defend these rights in various ways that they considered necessary. If the Norwegian and Swedish governments refused to give the Allied nations the commercial and shipping facilities that they considered necessary in wartime and that neutral countries could reasonably give, then the Allied governments would have to take appropriate steps to safeguard their interests. Although the Allied nations were fighting for themselves, they were also fighting for weak countries and could not allow their war effort to be hindered by the benefits that Germany obtained from Norway and Sweden. Therefore, the Allied nations reserved the right to take any steps they deemed necessary to prevent Germany from obtaining raw material supplies or conveniences from these two countries that were beneficial to Germany during the war and harmful to the Allied nations. The Allied nations' notes were worded like this. He then stated to the British and French ministers that the Allied nations had no reason to accuse the Norwegian government of being unfree and not independent. He believed that it was unfair to address the Norwegian government in this way. The Norwegian government had recently concluded agreements on commerce and shipping, and there was no reason to indicate that the Norwegian government did not respect these agreements. However, other than this, he could not and did not want to give an immediate reply, and the note did not mention the methods under consideration. He submitted the note to the government on Saturday and Sunday and made a phone call to the Swedish Foreign Minister to discuss and agree on drafting a reply according to this plan, but before the reply was issued, there was a development that created a completely new situation. Koht said after reporting on the Allied nations' note delivered to Norway yesterday, "I do not intend to say much about the meaning contained in the note. The Allied nations' actions of aggression were only because they had the power to do so. The Allied nations are now conducting the war within Norway's territorial sea, thinking that doing so will make it easier to win." Parliament Speaker Hambro spoke, expressing the hope that the government could eliminate the difficulties and that the inherent friendship would not be jeopardized too much. The Parliament unanimously agreed with Foreign Minister Koht's remarks (Reuters News Agency, 9th).

### Neutral Countries Are Anxious and Insecure

Amsterdam – The Netherlands has been deeply impressed by the actions of the Western European countries in laying mines in Norwegian territorial waters. It is generally expected that the position of small neutral countries will become increasingly difficult (Haitong News Agency, 9th).

Yugoslavia Capital – Regarding the British laying of mines in Norwegian territorial waters, South Slavic officials declared that the South will never succumb to any oppression and will defend its neutrality with all its strength (Haitong News Agency, 9th).

Rome – Regarding the British and French violation of Norwegian neutrality, political figures here believe that it is a major indication of the intensification of the international situation. It is said that when Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech in Ovieto the day before yesterday, he declared that Italy was actively preparing in all aspects to cope with any changes in the situation. Roman political figures pointed out that the British and French measures, no matter how they were interpreted, were acts of violating international law, and their purpose was to make neutral countries join the Allied countries in the war (Haitong News Agency, 9th).

Brussels – Defense Minister General Tenis visited Foreign Minister Spaak this morning to discuss the latest developments in the international situation (Havas News Agency, 9th).

Chongqing: The Fifth National Council of Political Participation held its eighth meeting at 3 PM today, continuing discussions on government reports reviewed by various review committees, government proposals, and council members' motions. It also elected resident committee members for the recess of the current assembly. Present were Speaker Chiang Kai-shek, Vice Speaker Zhang Boling, Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, Secretary Lei Zhen, Gu Xiwu, and council member Li Yongxin, totaling 123 individuals. Over ten heads of various agencies, including Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, and Ye Chucang, were also present. The meeting commenced at 3 PM, chaired by Speaker Chiang. After formal proceedings, each item was discussed. After a break, Speaker Chiang, due to pressing official matters, was replaced by Vice Speaker Zhang as chair. The council approved six reports on military affairs, foreign affairs, internal affairs, finance, economy, and transportation, along with numerous important motions. The key resolutions regarding the reports on foreign affairs, internal affairs, and transportation, as well as the important motions, are recorded as follows:

A. (1) Key resolutions regarding the foreign affairs report are as follows: (1) China's resistance war aims for the nation's and people's free survival, and the independence and integrity of territorial sovereignty. This established national policy shall never change. All proposals for resolving Sino-Japanese relations after the (September 18th) Incident cannot be universally applied due to the outbreak of war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should instruct envoys abroad to clarify this intent whenever possible. (2) Since the establishment of the puppet regime, our foreign affairs authorities have issued solemn statements, and many friendly nations have expressed their disdain. However, the Japanese puppet regime's schemes to undermine our nation know no bounds. The foreign affairs authorities should pay special attention and, when necessary, make more resolute and serious statements to correct international perceptions and promote national integrity. (3) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should seek to conduct treaty negotiations with Thailand to improve Sino-Thai relations and effectively protect overseas Chinese in Thailand. (4) Regarding foreign affairs administration, now that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expanded its organization, it should strive to enrich its work and enhance its effectiveness. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should strive for more systematic research on the situations in various countries to facilitate accurate judgments on the international situation, especially regarding the review of enemy intelligence. Greater attention should be paid to legal interpretation in the future.

(2) Key resolutions regarding the internal affairs report are as follows: (1) The improvement of personnel administration, encompassing assessment, continuation, rewards, and punishments, is of utmost importance. Thorough assessment is essential for effective supervision, and clear rewards and punishments are essential for incentivizing performance. The assessment, rewards, and punishments of administrative personnel at all levels of local government should be universally applied to ensure fairness. Past assessments have not extended to senior administrative personnel at the local level. In the future, the principle of starting punishment from the top and bestowing rewards on the lower levels should be followed, making assessment of senior officials essential. (2) Training for county-level cadres is an effective method for enhancing administrative efficiency and reforming local politics. In the future, the implementation of training should emphasize both spirit and technique. "Spirit" refers to the spirit of practical service, and "technique" refers to the techniques for solving problems encountered in practical service. (3) The promulgation of the new county system is an important measure for improving local administration and self-governance organizations in our country in recent years, and it is also a fundamental task for implementing constitutional government. The council members are extremely concerned and hope that the government will report to the council in detail on the recent implementation and any difficulties encountered. (4) Baojia (neighborhood watch) and household registration are important tasks for internal affairs. The government is requested to earnestly rectify Baojia and thoroughly investigate household registration to lay the foundation for self-governance. It is also necessary to strengthen local security and enhance the people's self-defense capabilities to benefit the future of the resistance war. (5) The deadline for banning opium is approaching. It is hoped that the government, without fear of difficulty, will use its greatest determination to ban cultivation, transportation, sale, storage, and smoking within the specified time limit to eliminate years of harm.

(3) Key resolutions regarding the transportation report are as follows: (1) Transportation is extremely important during the resistance war. It is hoped that the government, based on the principle of unified management, will continue to make reasonable adjustments to the transportation organization. (2) Efforts should be made to effectively link transportation in various provinces to achieve cooperation. (3) Drivers frequently cause accidents, and discipline is lax, making it necessary to intensify rectification. In the future, in addition to paying attention to training, attention should also be paid to strict management and the execution of discipline. (4) The testing of coal-fueled vehicles has proven effective and should be promoted as much as possible. If there are difficulties in application, they should be researched and resolved with all efforts to achieve universal implementation. (5) In the past six months, postal remittances have been effective in attracting remittances from overseas Chinese and promoting savings deposits, but the amount is still considered small. Greater efforts should be made in the future to achieve significant results. (6) The management of navigation on the Sichuan River and the operation of highway passenger vehicles should be actively improved in the future to facilitate transportation.

B. Important motions are as follows: (1) The government is actively promoting the production of rear area materials. How should funds and operational capabilities be concentrated to achieve significant results? The key resolution is as follows: The purpose of this motion is to encourage people to engage in production undertakings, which is commendable. The various regulations mentioned in the motion have been promulgated for a long time, and the government's intention to encourage production undertakings is evident. To further expand upon this, efforts should be made in the following areas: 1. The government must formulate various practical and feasible enterprise plans for people to choose to invest in. 2. The government must promulgate a reliable guarantee method, increasing the interest rates on existing industrial interest protection and subsidy regulations, and reducing excessive profit taxes on industrial and mining enterprises with greater risk, to further achieve universal effectiveness. Especially in these extraordinary times, unexpected losses are constantly feared. All mines and factories should be allowed to insure against land war disasters as a priority. 3. Regarding technology, in this extraordinary period, technical personnel are often in greater demand than supply and are not easy to recruit. The government should be responsible for assisting and training to enable factories to recruit more personnel. 4. Establish a design organization to handle design and investigation work on behalf of industrial, commercial, and mining enterprises, thereby encouraging them. 5. Transfer government-run enterprises that have achieved success, except those that should remain state-owned, to society and allow the people to take over their operation. 6. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs should designate reliable guarantees and issue industrial bonds to absorb idle funds for exclusive storage and use in industrial and mining undertakings. 7. The government should pay close attention to the raw materials, machinery, tools, and fuel required by private industrial and mining enterprises at all times and provide them with convenience to ensure a continuous supply for their maintenance.

(2) The government motion (Draft Outline for a Five-Year National Education Implementation Plan) was resolved and passed as follows: (1) The funds required for this plan are enormous. It is hoped that the government will consider the people's ability to bear the burden when raising funds and will not hinder the needs of the resistance war. (2) The implementation of this plan is complex. It is hoped that the government will plan carefully and implement it step by step. (3) Teacher training should be prepared before starting national schools. (4) Teachers should first be recruited from existing primary school teachers, two per school, and should be divided into teachers and substitute teachers according to their educational level. (5) When the Baojia head serves concurrently as the school principal, he must possess the legal qualifications of a primary school principal. (6) The education funds of each county and city, in addition to the central and provincial subsidies and the original funds, should be统筹handled by the province and city. (7) When the central government subsidizes local funds, it should provide more subsidies to poor provinces. (3) Council member Jiang Hengyuan and 23 others proposed to expedite the popularization of national education. It is requested that the central government allocate substantial funds and organize a committee to plan its affairs to complete the five-year implementation plan. The resolution was amended and passed. (4) Council member Jiang Hengyuan and 23 others proposed to aid in the popularization of national education and specially drafted measures for a school establishment and production movement. It is submitted for public resolution. The resolution was amended and passed and submitted to the government for adoption and implementation. (5) Council member Chen Qiye and 23 others proposed to establish a Central Institute of National Studies to promote our country's inherent culture and promote national rejuvenation. The resolution was: The purpose of this motion is to promote national studies, which is commendable. It is submitted to the government for reference. (9th dispatch)

### Western Front: Fierce Battles Between British and German Air Forces; German Single-Engine Aircraft Active; One Crashes Within French Defense Line

London – A Reuters special correspondent with the British Air Force in France reports that 18 or 20 German Messerschmitt fighters engaged in fierce combat yesterday with a smaller number of British Hurricane aircraft. The German planes were all single-engine Type 109s. One was shot down near Polaimoselle, within 12 miles of the Maginot Line, and its wreckage has been found. Another German aircraft was visibly damaged and seen crashing within the Allied lines, but its wreckage has not been located. It has been observed that in recent air battles, the Germans have been experimenting with their twin-engine cannon-equipped Messerschmitt 110s. The return to using the smaller Messerschmitt 109s suggests the Type 110 aircraft suffered heavy losses. In the current stage of the war, German Aviation Minister Goering is willing to sacrifice large quantities of the numerous Type 109s rather than lose the fewer and harder-to-replace Type 110 heavy aircraft. This shift may be temporary, but if it continues, what will the elite squadrons of Type 110 aircraft think? The specific purpose of deploying these aircraft to the Western Front was to create excitement and boost the morale of other German fighter squadrons, which are being depleted. The Germans undoubtedly hoped this squadron would intimidate British single-engine Hurricane pilots and French fighter pilots, but if so, their expectations have been thwarted.

### Australia Intensifies National Defense Preparations

Walpole – Australian Prime Minister Menzies delivered a speech on the fourth, addressing Australia's military efforts. He stated that Australia's national defense is not limited to Australia itself. If the British army is defeated in Europe, Australia will be in a dangerous situation, just as if enemy troops landed in Australia. If Britain and France are defeated, everything will be lost. Therefore, Australia's sending troops overseas is for the sake of defending Australia itself. The Military Cabinet recently decided to form a corps and is considering the status of the national defense forces. By June of this year, Australia will have 307,500 soldiers who have received three to four months of training, which will form a large defense force. Australia will continue to conscript one or two more batches of people for training, the number depending on temporary needs. These recruits will reside in camps for ten weeks of training. The situation today is different from that during the last war. Last time, it was only necessary to concentrate on recruiting and sending troops overseas to participate in the war. Today, it is necessary to consider both internal defense and external warfare. Before the war, the internal defense force consisted of 4,000 people. Now, it is necessary to have a standing force of 12,000 people. In addition to participating in the Imperial air defense plan, Australia's domestic air defense personnel will increase from 2,800 a year ago to 5,400. The navy will increase from 5,400 to 11,600 people. Australia can be proud of its use of national manpower, as industry also requires a great deal of manpower in addition to the military. In 1918, Australia had 2,500 workers manufacturing munitions. According to the current program, the Ministry of Supply will employ 17,000 people by June 1942, and there will be tens of thousands more building aircraft and defense projects.

### Breaches on the Puyang and Other Rivers; Flooding Disaster in Southern Hebei; Fertile Fields of the Past Now a Watery Land; Millions of Victims, Losses of 300 Million

Zhengzhou Correspondence: The area south of Taishan Mountain, east of the Taihang Mountains, and south of the Cangshi Road in southern Hebei Province is known as Southern Hebei. It is a vast plain with fertile fields and abundant products. Not long after the incident, the area fell into enemy hands.

Victims of Disaster Suffer Again from Floods

Last spring, Southern Hebei lacked rainfall, and autumn planting was delayed, resulting in signs of drought. However, starting on July 9, there were three days of heavy rain, and mountain torrents erupted. Consequently, the rivers of Southern Hebei reversed their past drought conditions, and accumulated water was difficult to discharge for a time. The water levels of the Puyang River, the 　 River, and the Grand Canal rose seven or eight feet to more than ten feet in a single day. The danger of flooding was imminent. The reasons for this unprecedented disaster of flooding, floating fields and houses, and displaced people are not simple. In this flood, all the rivers in Southern Hebei had breaches, with more than twenty in the Puyang River and North Grand Canal area being the most severe. Currently, 51 counties and 3 cities out of the 56 counties and cities in Southern Hebei have been turned into a watery land. The area affected totals 5,924,823 acres. The depth of the water ranges from one or two feet to thirty feet, and the width ranges from one or two rods to sixty li. Large boats can travel on the land. The total number of victims is three million, and the total property loss is as high as 300 million yuan. The heartbreaking and tragic disaster is evident.

Selling Children, Refugees on the Roads

Escaping for one's life and selling one's own flesh and blood are the only two options for the disaster victims at this time. Large numbers of refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, men and women carrying baskets and pushing carts, are fleeing outwards. According to investigations, two-thirds of the population of Qinghe County has fled. In Zhanghou Village, Hengshui County, only five households remain out of more than fifty households. In order to save their own lives and prolong the lives of their beloved children, they had no choice but to painfully sell their own children to others. Even worse, some were unable to sell their children and abandoned them by the roadside, enduring the pain and allowing their children to cry until they died. There is no greater human tragedy than this. Secondly, when it comes to the problem of food, due to a lack of grain, prices have risen. Families with grain dare not sell it, so the price of grain on the market continues to rise, and the amount of grain decreases. Currently, tree roots, bark, melon vines, bean stalks, and sweet potato stems and leaves have become food. The human hell is truly unbearable.

The curriculum and teaching hours shall be in accordance with the revised regulations on adult schools. 8. The expenses of the national school shall be raised by the bao itself in principle. The methods for raising funds shall be determined separately. 9. The elementary school department of the national school shall not charge tuition. The necessary student supplies may be sold to children at low prices by the school in conjunction with local cooperative organizations. The adult education department shall not charge fees. The textbooks used shall be requested by the school from the county and city governments. 10. The national school shall have one principal who shall be responsible for all school affairs. In economically and educationally developed areas, the county government shall select qualified personnel who meet the qualifications prescribed in Article 64 of the Revised Elementary School Regulations or who have passed the examination to be full-time principals.

### Finance: European War Escalates; US Dollar Suddenly Approaches 6 Yuan Mark; HSBC Still Maintains British Gold

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. The grey market for British and American exchange rates, after several days of fluctuation, suddenly experienced turbulence yesterday, with a surprisingly tight underlying trend. The expansion of the European situation has become a reality, causing anxiety. The market generally expected the US dollar to decline. Initially, the US dollar exchange rate fell by 0.0275, opening with a weak British pound and soft US dollar at 0.0625, reaching 6.09375 yuan. Speculators then entered, but US banks maintained a steady supply, and the market price was not significantly affected. After 10:30 AM, US banks gradually reduced their supply, benefiting foreign banks who entered the market to collect. The situation became tight. The afternoon saw increased speculative buying due to news reports that Germany had invaded Denmark and Norway had declared war on Germany. The disturbances in Europe were beyond repair. People considered a continued decline in exchange rates to be inevitable in the future. At that time, Chinese merchants frantically bought, and the supply could not meet the demand. The US dollar exchange rate broke through the 6 yuan mark, closing at 5.96875 yuan. The British gold price remained at 4 pence 0.125 (equivalent to a US-British exchange rate of 3.4725 yuan). This was due to the strong support of HSBC. The futures market for the US dollar was extremely tight, while the British gold price showed a slight decline. The gap between the futures and spot markets widened. It is said that the future foreign exchange situation will depend on whether the US-British exchange rate can break through 3.5 yuan (because there was a secret agreement between the US and Britain for a minimum exchange rate of 3.5 yuan before the outbreak of the European war). If it is difficult to break through, it will trigger a flurry of intervention.

Hong Kong Banks Buy US Dollars and Sell British Pounds

In the morning, London's large and small contracts were flat, New York's silver price remained at half, and London's gold price was stable. The exchange rates of British pound against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were flat. The US dollar fell by 0.0275 against the British pound, was unchanged against the Shanghai currency, and fell slightly by 0.015 against the French currency. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning with British gold at 4 pence 0.125 and the US dollar at 6.09375 yuan, with the British currency flat and the US dollar tighter by 0.0625 compared to the previous close due to the decline in the exchange rate. Although speculators came to buy forward US dollars after the opening, US commercial banks still had a supply at that time, so the market situation was stable. This included trading the current month's US dollar at 6.0625 and 0.03125, and the May US dollar at 5.875 yuan. HSBC's listed price was unchanged. The balanced tax on silver was also unchanged. Afterwards, US banks sold US dollars and bought British pounds, hedging the May exchange rate at 3.525 yuan. At the same time, Hong Kong banks sold US dollars and bought British pounds, hedging the spot exchange rate at 3.5425 yuan. The situation was calm. After 10:30 AM, beneficial parties suddenly came to buy, and speculators resumed their activities, and US banks' willingness to supply weakened, so the market situation became tighter and softer. This included beneficial parties absorbing the current month's US dollars from other banks at 6.03125 yuan, and speculators buying May US dollars from foreign banks at 5.84375 yuan. At that time, the spot US dollar had shrunk to 6.0625 yuan, and the futures were even softer. At one point, the May US dollar could be settled at only 5.8125 yuan. However, foreign banks' willingness to sell forward contracts soon became stronger, and the situation gradually stabilized. By the close, the spot British gold price remained at 4 pence 0.125 and the US dollar at 6.0625 yuan, the current month's price at 4 pence 0.078125 and 6 yuan, and the May price at 3 pence 984375 and 5.84375 yuan, with the British currency flat and the US dollar tighter by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening.

Futures Buying Trend Even Stronger

The post-market initially opened with spot and futures being flat, but speculators came to buy again, settling the current month's US dollar from foreign banks at only 5.96875 yuan. At that time, the spot market was still stable. Around 3:00 PM, news suddenly came that the European war had expanded, so the people of this city were pessimistic about the exchange rate. The buying trend in the futures US dollar became even stronger, and Chinese banks also became active, and foreign banks' willingness to supply was weak. Spot and futures prices became tighter and softer step by step. Trading opened with the current month's US dollar at 5.9375 to 875 yuan, and the May US dollar at 5.78125 to 71875 yuan. By the close, the spot US dollar was only at 5.96875 yuan, but the British gold price remained firmly at 4 pence 0.125. The current month's British gold price was at 4 pence 0.0625, the US dollar at 5.875 yuan, the May British gold price at 3 pence 96875 yuan, and the US dollar at 5.6875 yuan. As a result, the spot British currency was flat and the US dollar tighter by 0.1875 compared to the previous day. The current month's British currency shrunk by 0.015625 and the US dollar softened by 0.21875. The May British currency was tighter by 0.015625 and the US dollar was higher by 0.15.

Hong Kong US Dollar Tightens

### Gold Reaches New High Price: Sees Peak of 5,660 Yuan

Yesterday's spot gold market experienced a sudden surge after six days of decline, reaching 5,660 yuan, breaking the previous high record of 5,590 yuan on March 31 and creating an unprecedented peak price. The reasons were the tightening of the exchange market and the deteriorating situation in Europe, with Germany invading Denmark and Norway declaring war on Germany, indicating an expansion of the war. The market was temporarily chaotic, and operators added to their holdings, leading to repeated high prices. The initial opening was 5,490 yuan, a significant increase of 93 yuan compared to the previous day, due to the reported contraction of the exchange rate and the softening of the US dollar. Subsequently, it was sold off by money changers, securities firms, and silver houses, falling slightly to a low of 5,455 yuan. However, after hearing that the foreign exchange was consistently tight around noon, buying interest gradually increased. Banks and silver houses took in large amounts, and gold and securities firms also increased their holdings, so it rose again to 5,540 yuan. In the afternoon, news from Europe spread, adding fuel to the fire, and buyers rushed to buy. Although there were not a few who took profits at high prices, there was ultimately a shortage of supply. The price jumped to the record high of 5,660 yuan. It was heard that gold and silver houses were the strongest buyers. The closing result was still 5,655 yuan, a surge of 258 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was brisk throughout the day, totaling about 5,000 taels. Jewelry stores immediately raised their gold prices by 25 yuan, creating a peak price of 570 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Jumps 258 Yuan

From the morning, the initial opening for each tael (10 liang) saw the exchange rate contract, the US dollar tighten, and confidence rise. G-chips were heard calling for purchases, and the market opened at an increased price of 93 yuan. Securities firms entered the gold market at 5,490 yuan per ten taels. Subsequently, a certain money changer agreed to supply, and gold and securities firms and silver houses also sold off, and many retail investors shorted. Although money changers and silver houses successively bought for their own firms, the positions were still felt to be abundant, and they soon fell back slightly by 35 yuan. Money changers sold 30 taels to securities firms for 5,455 yuan. Then, the sellers gradually decreased, and a certain money changer's buying interest remained strong, rising again by more than 20 yuan. Unexpectedly, at that time, the spot and futures US dollar exchange rates continued to be reported as tight and soft, so the buying trend was even stronger. Gold firms were searching to buy at increased prices, and securities firms were also switching from selling to buying, thus breaking through the 5,500 yuan mark. Money changers entered a total of 50 taels, actually at 5,525 yuan. However, at that time, floating longs took profits and sold off, briefly falling back to 5,505 yuan. But securities firms and money changers revived their buying interest, and a certain silver house came back to buy aggressively, leaping another 35 yuan. Gold firms entered 30 taels from silver houses for 5,540 yuan. Later, the silver house sold 50 taels to the gold firm for 5,535 yuan as the noon price. In the afternoon, the market was even stronger, jumping 25 yuan at the opening. Securities firms sold 20 taels to silver houses for 5,560 yuan. Later, the bullish securities firms slightly came to sell off again, falling back 10 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to money changers for 5,550 yuan. After this, money changers bought in, and at that time the exchange rate was reported to be soft, rising again by 30 yuan. For a long time, it fluctuated between 5,570 and 80 yuan. Unexpectedly, the rising trend started again around 3:00 PM. A certain silver house first came to release positions and bought aggressively, and the gold firms followed closely, and the buying trend expanded. And the exchange rate of foreign exchange continued to be reported as tight and soft. Although securities firms and money changers etc. came to sell off, they all took the opportunity to raise prices, soaring 70-80 yuan. Gold firms entered 50 taels from securities firms for 5,660 yuan. After entering, the buying trend slightly subsided, falling slightly by 5 yuan. Silver houses did 20 taels between each other, for 5,655 yuan as the closing price. As a result, it rose by 258 yuan compared to the previous day, with fluctuations of 205 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current gold of the gold shops is several yuan higher according to the spot gold, and the buying price is reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little trading.

Jewelry Gold Rises 25 Yuan Consecutively

At the beginning, the jewelry gold sold by the silver shops was still 545 yuan, but at 9:30, it was increased by 5 yuan, at 10:45, it was increased by another 5 yuan, at 12:05, it was increased by another 5 yuan, at 3:15 in the afternoon, it was increased by another 5 yuan, and at 4:00, it was increased by another 5 yuan. As a result, it was increased by a total of 25 yuan. The large peers changed to 570 yuan, and the new peers were similar to the previous price (the above is an unprecedented record since the market began). The buying price was reduced by around 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply

Yesterday's foreign currency market suddenly experienced a surprising surge. British and American gold pounds followed the sudden and rapid advance of spot gold. British gold notes remained stable. American gold notes closely followed the rise of the US exchange rate, initially trading at 16.20 yuan, then gradually rising to 16.38 yuan, then slightly falling back to 16.278 yuan. At noon, it rose again to 16.40 yuan. In the afternoon, news spread that German troops had actually entered Danish territory, causing the European war to expand further. The price of British pounds was bound to continue to decline, leading to increased buying interest and continued price increases. The market rose to 16.68 yuan in the evening. Hong Kong notes remained stable and in demand, with market prices continuing to rise. French franc notes and Dutch, Annamite, Rupee, Canadian, and Philippine notes all rose in tandem. Japanese gold notes initially fell and then rose, eventually seeing a 5% increase, reaching 1.1325 yuan in the evening. Korean notes recovered, reaching 1.1115 yuan in the evening. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds rise by 6 yuan each, American gold notes rise by 0.57 yuan, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.01 yuan, French franc notes rise by 0.001 yuan, Dutch notes rise by 0.10 yuan, Annamite notes and Rupee and Canadian notes all rise by 0.05 yuan, Philippine notes rise by 0.15 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Exchange and Discount Rates Rise Again

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and notes suddenly rose, from around 62 yuan per thousand yuan in the morning to 63 yuan, and then to 65.5 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 4.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association's overnight interest rate was unchanged at 0.20 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: Political Instability: How Can Securities Alone Be Stable?

Yesterday's spot securities market saw a slight setback in the rising trend, but the foundation remained firm. In the afternoon, the spot prices for domestic varieties, excluding those drawn in the lottery, were only slightly lower by 0.5 yuan. The spot prices failed to rise immediately due to tight credit and restrictions on multiple parties. The situation in the city was unstable, and people were worried, so the trend was slightly discouraged. Gold was rising, the European war was expanding, and the future was full of changes, so public bonds would also be unstable. Yesterday's buyers were still mainly Xinfu and No. 20, who were the most enthusiastic. Lianhe No. 38 also bought consistently. Other buyers included No. 16, No. 41, Taifeng, Renchang, Shuntai, and Tongkang. Runyi, Yichang, Yuankang consistently sold. Lianyi, Shengda, Zhenkang, and Mada also sold, causing the spot prices to be slightly weak. As a result, Class C shares, excluding the lottery shares, were 0.7 yuan lower, and the rest were only about 0.1-0.2 yuan lower. The total number of transactions was more than 800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

In stock trading, 35 shares of China Bank were transacted at a price of 14 yuan.

The opening of the public stock market was robust, and a firm trend, unseen for a long time, was observed again yesterday. The market was even more active in the early afternoon. Although many people took profits, the buying interest was unusually strong, and all stocks were able to maintain their rising prices. Suddenly, news came that German troops had invaded Denmark, and the market was immediately affected. Sellers rushed to sell, and prices plummeted instantly. British Union shares opened at 42 yuan and fluctuated for a long time. The number of transactions was large. The closing price was 42.25 yuan for buying and 42.5 yuan for selling. China Reclamation shares saw a high price record of 20 yuan again yesterday. The situation was lively and enthusiastic, no different from the previous few days. 110,000 shares were traded, and the closing price was softer, with 19.2 yuan for buying and 19.4 yuan for selling. The trading volume of Yangtze Silver Company, Shanghai Silver Company, and Jardine shares was extremely large. They closed at lower prices of 17 yuan, 27.5 yuan, and 46.5 yuan, respectively.

Rubber shares were very active yesterday, and prices soared at one point, but the closing price also softened.

London, 8th (Monday) telegram: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British companies' Far East stocks were stable today, with no increase or decrease in prices.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Sales Improve; Yarn Prices Soar

Shuangma is close to the 1,200 yuan mark, and the market is rising again. The current yarn sales are smooth, and demand from Hong Kong is strong, greatly boosting confidence. Buying interest is very high, so the market is soaring, creating new high prices. The current yarn price of 20-count Shuangma has reached 1,198 yuan.

The morning opening for the current yarn was due to the contraction of the British and American exchange rates and the rise in gold, resulting in a strong buying interest. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma current yarn was 1,175 yuan, rising directly to 1,198 yuan. Profits were taken along the way, slightly reducing the price, but the active sales of current goods caused it to rise again. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,515 bales were traded. In addition to the 50 yuan increase in the spot price of 20-count Shuangma, the factory opened 550 bales of 20-count special Jincheng yarn at 1,130-1,135 yuan current price from the Yongnu Factory. 700 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each trading group is listed below:

Hong Kong 1,175, Peer 1,260

Fuzhou 10, Inland 80

Total 2,525

### Cotton Also Rises by 3 Yuan

The current cotton trading slightly improved due to the rising gold price and the contracting exchange rate, which boosted confidence. Market sentiment also rose by more than 3 yuan along with the yarn market. Some people believed that if the European war expanded and the overseas shipping was lacking, it would be good in the future. However, at present, the cotton arriving in Shanghai is huge. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left. For foreign cotton market prices, see the New York cotton market.

Mitlin 276.50 Fellow Entered 200 pieces

Also 268.00

Tongzhou Packaged 34.50 Also 200 pieces

Tongzhou White Package 208.10 Also 70 bales

Also 208.50 Also 85 bales

Also 20.75 Also 250 bales

Pingguo Er 176.00 Also 500 pieces

Duli La 207.75 Also 100 pieces

Mitlin 270.00 Domestic and Foreign Entry 100 pieces

Another message regarding the foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market, which initially fell due to the selling of overseas cotton merchants, and subsequently rose due to the purchase of spot merchants and the purchase on the market by the same industry, ultimately closed at a price that was 5-6 decimals higher than the previous day. The Indian market situation was quite firm. Yesterday, the forecast rose again by 5 points. The Egyptian market rose by more than 10 British pounds.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading was also active yesterday due to the brisk yarn sales of the Guangdong merchants, coupled with the rise of the overseas cotton market, and the news from overseas in the afternoon that the situation in Europe was tense and conflicts had occurred in Norway. The mentality of the local industry turned exciting again, and the current goods were vigorously searched in the market, but there was no supply to meet the demand. The general opinion is that both yarn and cotton will be high in the market. The prices of yesterday's cotton market converted to the factory price at an exchange rate of 6 yuan per US dollar are as follows:

20 count US Mitlin 290.70

Also, Also Lower Grade 280.50

30 count Also 306.75

Also, Also Lower Grade 298.50

42 count Also 310.25

Also, Also Lower Grade 300.00

### Medicinal Materials: New Gardenia Arrives

Jielong Bank, Quan Zhou packed new Gardenia transported by the Xiangtai Wheel, 43 bags arrived in Shanghai, and all were contracted and distributed by Xin Kaihe Jiuxingli Longmao Bank. The supply of this medicine has been scarce for a long time, and the amount is limited, so the market has not yet opened, it is said.

### Food: Local Rice Arrives, Slightly Stronger; Rice Prices Frequently Reported to Be Falling

Domestic sources are gradually becoming clearer, and arrivals are increasing day by day. Yesterday, the morning saw even more severe price drops than before. Both domestic and foreign rice experienced a sudden plunge of more than 2 yuan. By the noon market, activity had picked up and prices rebounded. As a result, the final decline was only about half a yuan. The first domestic rice merchants that listed the samples for the market were even more crowded. South Port offered early and late rice varieties, continuing to sell cheaply, opening at only 37-38 yuan. The general Zhongguan Fenjing variety from Jiangsu and Tongzhou also followed suit, falling below the limit price, selling at 39 yuan. It was heard that in the black market, only some high-end goods and special orders were sold. Special Changbang Jing was sold for only 42 yuan, the mid-range variety for 41 yuan, Kun Jing for 41.5 yuan and 40 yuan, Qingsi Te Yuan rice for 41 yuan, and then dropped to 40 yuan for retail. Jiangbei Jian was around 37-38 yuan. The Hongkou Dachang Company imported more than 5,000 bags of Jing and glutinous rice, causing the sentiment to unanimously decline, creating a sharp drop. The most miserable was the glutinous rice, as the previous bottom price was already cheap, and now it continues to depreciate, to be sold alongside broken rice. At the lowest, high-quality goods were sold for only 34.5 yuan, and the lower grades were only 33-34 yuan, and even 32.78 yuan. This is because the sales of wine are stagnant, and relying solely on pastries etc. is ultimately limited.

Foreign rice was suddenly affected by a sharp drop. No. 1 Saigon fell to 40 yuan and 39 yuan in the central market, No. 2 to 36.5 yuan and 36 yuan, Huojiao to 38.5 yuan and 37.8 yuan, Xiaojiao to 35.2 yuan and 35 yuan, mixed broken to 31.9 yuan, and rice gruel to 27 yuan. After this low price, it was able to attract searches from inland rural customers and replenishment from shops. The situation in the noon market turned tight, and all prices rose again by 1.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon was 40.05 yuan, Chen No. 2 was 38 yuan and 37.5 yuan, Huojiao was 39.5 yuan, No. 2 Siam was 37.5 yuan, Xiaojiao was 36.8 yuan and 36.5 yuan, mixed broken was 33.2 yuan and 32.8 yuan, rice gruel was 28.5 yuan and 28 yuan, and Tokyo broken was 37.5 yuan and 37 yuan. The market was still weak, the foundation was unstable, and one move immediately led to relaxation. By the time of the close, the market for each product had become weak again.

More than 6,000 bags of foreign rice arrived again, transported from Haiphong by the Yihua Foreign Company's Taisheng Wheel with 5,062 bags, and 1,320 bags transported from Hong Kong. The wheel arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 8th) and docked at Roosevelt for unloading. (Zu)

### Flour Loses Its Basis; A Large Batch of Foreign Wheat Is About to Arrive

Flour continued to be weak yesterday, as sales in this street remained normal after the decline of the base price. The Japanese ordered export licenses for flour, and flour exports were invisibly hindered. The price of rice plummeted, and the old Chepai goods only opened at 14.34 yuan, and the price of the warship warehouse list was only 13 yuan. The price of flour in Changshu and inland areas was also invisibly lower. After the No. 2 flour mill's prices were changed to 13.5 yuan, the customer prices could also be lowered by 0.3-0.4 yuan, but in reality there were almost no new transactions.

Wheat was also sluggish yesterday, as it was heard that a total of 5-6 ships of foreign wheat contracted by each factory will arrive in this month. Although Chinese factories are purchasing, they are all choosing the cheapest ones. It was heard that Changshu wheat could no longer stand at the 23 yuan mark, and the prices of medium-grade goods were even cheaper. The price of Wuhu Zhongguan wheat was only 22.34 yuan, and the price of the wet medium-grade goods was only 20.05 yuan. About 1,000+ bags of sales.

### Scarcity of Soybean Development

Recently, the soybean market conditions have remained externally strong but internally weak. In general, the position is ample, making it difficult to stimulate sentiment. Although there was a period of tightness, it softened in an instant. Yesterday, the market saw inquiries from oil mills and Xiamenese traders, but with only ordinary demand, the overall situation remained loose.

### Piece Goods - Cloth Prices Rise Directly - Hoarding Becomes More Common

Due to the expansion of the European war and the sharp rise in gold prices, the concept of hoarding both within and outside the industry has become increasingly prevalent. In addition, customer sales remain strong, so cloth prices are rising steadily. The morning market rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt compared to the previous day. The afternoon situation was even tighter, with prices rising by about 5 jiao per bolt. Da Peng, Fugui, fine cloth twill, and Lun Chang Ewo goods were the most sought after. Spot goods and grey cloth for April and May delivery totaling more than 100,000 bolts were traded in this street. There were also more than two hundred bolts of bleached cloth, fine cloth, foreign yarn, and colored cloth. Traders from Zhejiang, Fujian, Yunnan, and Guangdong provinces also made purchases. However, due to the drastic changes in cloth prices in the Shanghai market, both buyers and fellow traders held a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a sluggish sales volume. 270 bolts of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 10th.

New York Stocks

New York Telegraph on the 8th: Today's stock market saw steel stocks turn uneven after steel mill operations were reduced. Automobile stocks took the lead. Oil stocks gradually attracted attention because reports indicated that the industry's profits were much larger than last year. Otherwise, there were no important news.

Rubber

New York Telegraph on the 8th: The demand for physical rubber remains good, and incoming shipments are expensive. This is the characteristic of today's market amidst silence. The earlier gains were reduced by a large trader who exerted pressure in the afternoon. The total amount of rubber imported from outside Malaya in March was 17,565 tons, compared to 16,059 tons last month.

### Eye-Catching Domestic and Foreign News: Municipal Council Elections Commence This Morning – Voting Until 3 PM Tomorrow – Increased British and American Votes Suggest Promising Victory

The Municipal Council election, entering its decisive phase over these two days starting today, will hold voting sessions at the Wan Guoshang Tuan (Shanghai Volunteer Corps) drill hall on Fuzhou Road and the Hongkou Xiaocai Chang (Hongkou Small Vegetable Market), respectively, starting at 10 AM this morning. Given the large-scale activities undertaken by the British-American united front and the Japanese side in recent days, it is anticipated that over 9,500 taxpayers will participate in the voting. Regarding the respective strengths of the two sides, according to Mr. Judd, chairman of the American Election Committee, the number of British and American taxpayers has increased significantly. The Japanese side also claims that with 400-500 votes from third-country electors leaning towards the Japanese side, they can exceed 4,000 votes. As for the number of votes the British and American candidates may obtain, it is believed to be comparable to the Japanese side. This tense situation is unprecedented since the public concession began holding council elections. Even in 1936, when the Japanese first requested an increase in candidates, it was not comparable. Whether the administrative power of the concession will be guaranteed intact, whether the status quo can be maintained, or whether it will be controlled by the Japanese side, are all matters of great concern. Taxpayers must make a careful decision about which path to take. The list of British, American, and Japanese candidates is as follows: (1) Arlemann, (2) Canner, (3) Tashiro, (4) Hayle, (5) Hanawa Yutaro, (6) Cadiz, (7) Kuroda Keitaro, (8) Abbot Lick McDonald, (9) Renoir McDonald, (10) Mitchell, (11) Okamoto Kazuhira, (12) Okomoto Otsuji, (13) Powell, totaling thirteen individuals.

British and American Campaign: Meticulous Arrangements

In recent days, the British-American and Japanese Election Committees have made their utmost efforts to get every taxpayer to participate in the voting. Taxpayers who are unclear about voting matters can inquire with the election committees and receive assistance. Each election committee has hired a large number of cars to provide dedicated transportation, making it convenient for taxpayers to go to the polls. The British-American Election Committee also issued a large number of slogans yesterday, urging taxpayers to pay attention, stating: "Vote for five British candidates and two American candidates," "Do not allow Japanese candidates to obtain an absolute majority to change the status quo of the concession," "If you are unclear about voting procedures, the Election Committee can provide as much assistance as possible," "The public concession should be absolutely internationalized for the benefit of the public, but this requires your full support."

Universally Optimistic: Victory is Hopeful

The mentality of the general British taxpayer has greatly changed from the past. They had previously held a skeptical attitude, but since yesterday, they have become optimistic and firm, believing that the British side can secure victory. Therefore, predictions about the outcome of this election have become the goal of general predictions. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps added a prediction yesterday, saying that the results of this election would be roughly visible after the polls close at 3 PM tomorrow. Another opinion is that this matter may not be revealed until Friday morning. However, the British and American candidates seem to have an absolutely optimistic attitude about securing victory, as it was learned yesterday from reliable sources that British and American candidates can obtain at least 4,000 votes. A week ago, when the Japanese side put forward as many as five candidates, the Japanese side actually believed that their candidates could obtain at least 3,700 votes, which was enough to exceed the 3,500 votes obtained by the British and American side. Observing the situation where all parties are criticizing the Municipal Council daily, it seems to be favorable to the Japanese side. However, although the British and Americans and people from all walks of life have shown dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council, they all attach more importance to the existence of the Yangjingbang land charter and should still take those with the widest range of rights and interests in Shanghai as the standard. Based on this point of view, it is believed that they can definitely defeat the Japanese side, as the property owned by the Japanese in Shanghai is not comparable to that of the British and Americans.

Jewish Confusion: Short-Sighted Vision

In terms of publicity, the British and Americans paid particular attention to Jews and Russian expatriates, because their number of electoral votes, in addition to British, American, and Japanese votes, is more than any other expatriates, and has a significant impact. British and American propaganda organs have specially alerted the Jews, saying, "If the Japanese win, the Jews will be expelled from Shanghai. Given the anti-Jewish claims in Japan, this kind of event will be re-enacted in Shanghai, which is indeed possible." As far as the current situation is concerned, some Jewish refugees are indeed forced by power and deceived by sweet words, and will help the Japanese side at that time. However, there are also many who understand the great righteousness and know that if the Japanese win in this election, the rights and interests of the concession will gradually be monopolized by them. Some have politely refused, and some are ready to abstain.

Russians Understand Japan Thoroughly

Although there are only more than two hundred Russian taxpayers, they also have the potential to sway the overall situation, so the Japanese side has used great enticement, even if they cannot help the Japanese candidates, they have advised them to abstain and not support the British and Americans. However, according to reliable sources yesterday, although the Russians in this port have always been suspected of being pro-Japanese, only a small number are willing to vote for them in this election, and the majority have expressed their willingness to vote for the British and American candidates. Although the Japanese side publicized heavily a few days ago that they had received a response from the Russians, judging from the situation, this propaganda has obviously failed. According to a Russian expatriate living in the area south of the Suzhou River yesterday, the Russians are aware that the Russian propaganda seen on Avenue Joffre is done by the Japanese, and they have long understood the Japanese face. Taking the treatment of Russian expatriates in Harbin as an example, it is clear. According to reports, most of the Russian expatriates in Harbin have been expelled by the Japanese, and most of the areas where Russian expatriates live have also been seized by the Japanese. In addition, the situation in Dalian, Beiping, and Shenyang is also the same. Most of the Russians living in these three places have suffered tremendous losses under the slogan of "East Asian New Order" established by the Japanese, and have no place to stand, so they fled to Shanghai. They believe that Shanghai is the largest free world for Russian expatriates. Unexpectedly, not long after the Russian expatriates lived in Shanghai, the Japanese forces expanded again, and there was even the possibility of the Russian expatriates encountering the same fate as Harbin. Therefore, after much thought, the Russian expatriates decided not to let the Japanese win in this election and help them seize the administrative power of the Municipal Council, because they are all afraid of the past, such as the censorship of newspapers and the frequent disappearances of relatives and friends, which may be re-enacted in Shanghai. Therefore, what the Russian expatriates are worried about is actually different from other foreign expatriates. Other foreign expatriates are deeply afraid that if the Japanese gain power, the economy will suffer a fatal blow, while the Russian expatriates are afraid that their daily lives will not be stable.

Japanese Candidates Hold Tea Party

In view of the increasingly precarious situation in recent days, the Japanese side was very worried, so they came up with a whimsical idea. Candidate Hanawa Yutaro invited celebrities and diplomatic officials from various countries in Shanghai to a tea party at his residence on Rue Cardinal Fesch on the afternoon of the 8th, under the pretext of viewing cherry blossoms, hoping to get help.

Annual Meeting Scheduled for the 17th

The foreign taxpayer's annual meeting will also be held on the 17th of this month. The agenda is as follows: (1) Elect Mr. Mosso as the chairman of the meeting, (2) Elect Mr. Nasi as the secretary of the meeting, (3) The rules of procedure adopted at the previous meeting shall still apply to this meeting, (4) Nominate Mr. Klon as a real estate committee member for the following year, (5) Elect four hospital managers for the following year, (6) Report on the report and accounts up to December 31 of last year, (7) Support and pass the new budget proposal for 1940 submitted by the outgoing board of directors, (8) New rules of procedure recognized as valid and adopted by this meeting, shall remain valid until the next meeting during the valid period.

Chen Tingrui Supplements the Chinese Committee

The Chinese taxpayer's association of the public concession should elect five Chinese directors, five committee members, and one land committee member of the Municipal Council this year. In addition to the previous proposal of 51 representatives by the majority vote, it is still requested that Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and others continue to be re-elected. There is also one committee member who should be nominated. Yesterday, the former committee member Chen Tingrui Zuren was nominated and was immediately formally informed to the Municipal Council for verification.

### Strengthen Defenses on Both Sides of the Suzhou River – Iron Gate on the South Bank of the Xin Zha Bridge is Only Open on the East Side

In recent days, the situation in Zhabei along the concession has suddenly become tense. At each entrance and exit, such as the two bridges of Xin Zha and Wuzhen Road, the sentries of the Japanese Navy Marine Corps and the Chinese police are inspecting pedestrians and vehicles with extreme strictness. No matter male or female pedestrians passing by, they must be carefully inspected by Japanese soldiers. If they carry objects, the inspection is even stricter. When vehicles pass, passengers must get out of the vehicle one by one for inspection. If there is any suspicion, they will be taken to the headquarters for interrogation. On the concession side, on the west side of Hainan Road, at the intersection of Gansu Road facing west, from Rehe Road to the intersection of Xizang Road, British soldiers have thickened the original barbed wire mesh frame and raised it by five or six feet. The iron gate on the west side of the south bank of the Xin Zha Bridge has been closed for three days, so only the east side is currently open.

### After the Japanese Opened Nanshi, They Plan to Continue Opening Various Iron Gates

Since the Japanese announced the opening of Nanshi, in addition to the iron gates of Xin Kaihe, Xin Qiaojie, Nanyang Bridge, and Xie Bridge that have already been opened, the Japanese also plan to continue opening the iron gates in the French Concession Kunlian Nanshi area along the 16th Wharf.

### The Case of US Radio Interference: A Written Protest Will Be Filed – Miura's Investigation and Reply are Indefinite – The US Consulate Has Reported to the US State Department in Washington

The Continental Daily reports that the US Consul General in this port, Mr. Heile, visited the Japanese Consul General Miura yesterday morning (the 8th) and verbally protested about the disturbance of the wavelength of the US commercial radio station (call sign XMHA). Miura especially promised to "investigate this matter," but the date of the Japanese reply has not been stipulated. However, if the Japanese continue to disturb the wavelength, it is expected that the US Acting Consul General Bertolik will file a written protest to the Japanese Consul General. According to well-informed sources yesterday, the US authorities have telegraphed the details of this matter to the State Department in Washington.

### French Concession Promulgates Weights and Measures Standards – Using Meters, Liters, and Kilograms as Standards – Weighing Instruments Must Be Inspected and the British System is Generally Used

The English-language China Press reports that the French Concession Municipal Council has promulgated precise standards and regulations for the measuring and weighing instruments used in stores, controlling measurement and curbing illegal profiteering by food vendors, which is another step forward. According to the regulations in the Municipal Council Gazette, no one may manufacture, sell, or repair measuring instruments in the French Concession without a special license. All sellers and repairers must have a mark registered with the Municipal Council on each instrument, and the number of sales or repairs must be recorded. Shops or workshops that have not obtained the permission of the Municipal Council are not allowed to sell or repair weighing instruments, and must purchase accurate instruments approved by the Municipal Council to verify whether the weighing instruments they manufacture are accurate. The standard unit of length adopted in the French Concession is the meter, the unit of capacity is the liter, and the unit of weight is the kilogram. As for the weighing instruments calculated in pounds, feet, and gallons used in the UK, they can also be used if they are marked with equivalent calculations in kilograms, meters, and liters.

### US Embassy Counselor Transferred to Shanghai Consul General – Lockhart Has Long Been Reputable in Diplomatic Circles – Before His Arrival, Butterick Will Temporarily Act as Agent

United Press International, Washington, 9th – The US State Department announced yesterday that Lockhart, Counselor of the US Embassy in Peiping, has been appointed as US Consul General in Shanghai, replacing Gauss, who left Shanghai last week to take up the post of first US Minister to the Commonwealth of Australia. Lockhart served as Acting Consul General two years ago when Gauss returned to the US on leave. The date when the new Consul General will take office has not yet been decided. Before Lockhart's arrival, Consul Butterick will remain in office as Acting Consul General.

Still Holds Original Post

The English-language China Press reported that Lockhart, Counselor of the US Embassy in China and concurrently Consul General in Tianjin, has been transferred to Consul General in Shanghai, but when he will come to take up his new post has not been announced. It is rumored that after taking up his new post, Lockhart will continue to serve as Counselor of the Embassy.

Lockhart's Brief Biography

Lockhart was born in Beaserburg, Iowa, on April 8, 1881. He studied at Graceland University. From 1901 to 1902, he served as an assistant editor of a newspaper in Beaserburg. From 1902, he served as a secretary to a member of Congress until 1913. He served as a secretary to a senator. Later, he entered the officialdom and was appointed as the Deputy Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Section, and was quickly transferred to the position of Planner of the State Department until 1920. The next arms reduction conference was held in Washington, and Lockhart served as an assistant commissioner. In 1925, he was promoted to Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Section. In the same year, the China Customs Special Conference was held in Peiping, and Lockhart came to China as a member of the US delegation. After the meeting, Lockhart was appointed as Consul General in Hankou until 1931, when he was transferred to Consul General in Tianjin. In 1935, he was appointed as Counselor of the US Legation. This position was later changed to US Embassy Counselor. From February 14 to September 19, 1938, and from December last year to January this year, Lockhart came to Shanghai twice during Gauss's absence and temporarily served as Consul General. Lockhart's wife is also in China, and they have a son and a daughter. His son graduated from college in June this year, and his daughter married a US Navy officer in Hankou a few years ago.

### Reward and Punishment Measures for Railway Employees

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many railway employees have bravely resisted Japan and sacrificed themselves for the country, and a few have willingly surrendered to the enemy. After the Ministry of Communications formulated the "Temporary Reward and Punishment Measures for Railway Employees in Occupied Areas," it specially instructed the Shanghai-Nanjing-Ningbo Railway Special Party Department and other levels of Party departments to follow and conduct investigations on their personnel for verification. The original text reads: "Since the outbreak of the war, the railway employees under this road have been outraged and organized groups in the occupied areas to resist Japan at the risk of their lives, resulting in death. Their perseverance and determination to die for righteousness are commendable. Even those who temporarily stumbled and were trapped in false rebellion and forced to follow the Japanese often seized the opportunity to extricate themselves and abandon rebellion for righteousness, and their aspirations are also commendable. If rewards and condolences are not distinguished, how can loyalty and integrity be encouraged? Or a few of the traitors who were willing to surrender to the enemy and remained unrepentant, the country has permanent punishment, and the crime is unforgivable. It is also necessary to enforce the law strictly to show Jiong's warning. This special regulation of five 'Temporary Reward and Punishment Measures for Railway Employees in Occupied Areas' is used to highlight the performance. All our employees should encourage each other. (1) Those who participate in the Anti-Japanese War work in the occupied area, after being restored, with the certificate of the Party and Military Administration Office in the war zone, will be allowed to return to their original position, and those with special achievements may be promoted as appropriate. (2) Those who died or injured in the occupied area due to participating in the Anti-Japanese War work, after being restored, with the certificate of the Party and Military Administration Office in the war zone, the original service unit will check and settle the pension in accordance with the regulations on pension. (3) Those who are sent by the Party and Military Administration Office of the war zone to the occupied area to work under the Japanese puppet organization, after being certified, the reward and pension will be the same as the previous two items. (4) Employees who work for the Japanese puppet organization should be punished according to the severity of the circumstances after being restored. (5) Employees who have worked for the Japanese puppet organization, after repenting and surrendering themselves, or performing meritorious service while serving their sentences, with the certificate of the Party and Military Administration Office in the war zone, will be allowed to return to their positions after being restored, but may be downgraded and have their salaries reduced as appropriate."

### Pawnshops in West Shanghai – Ordered to Close Within a Time Limit – Each Pawnshop Stops Pawning and Waits for Redemption – The Poor are Extremely Anxious

The residents of West Shanghai are becoming increasingly poor, so the pawn industry has developed abnormally, with no less than 40 shops. There is no fixed capital, the redemption period is only one or two months, and the interest is extremely high. Now they are ordered to pay heavy donations, and the pawnshop industry is determined not to comply, so they have been ordered to close within a time limit by the pseudo "police station." Therefore, each pawnshop has posted notices in recent days, saying, "Customers must come to redeem their pawns before the 13th of this month, otherwise they will be deemed abandoned." The general poor people are unable to prepare funds for redemption on a temporary basis, and are all extremely anxious.

### Detailed Rules for Returning Police Power in the Northern District – Negotiations Have Not Yet Been Finalized – Reporters Raised Questions at the News Conference – The Japanese Side Claimed it Was Related to the Election

The Shanghai Times reported that Municipal Council President Facklering and Japanese Consul General Miura signed a basic agreement on March 1 regarding the return of full management of the Police Department in the public concession north of the Suzhou River. Yesterday morning (the 8th) starting at 10:00 AM, senior officials of the Police Department and officials from the Japanese Consulate, Army, Navy, and Gendarmerie, and the headquarters of the Japanese Navy Marine Corps discussed the details of returning the Northern District until 1:00 PM.

Continued Talks

The two sides will continue to talk, but the date has not been determined. Those who attended the talks yesterday included four representatives from the Japanese Consulate General: Sato, Consul Isono, etc.; four representatives from the Japanese Army and Gendarmerie: Lieutenant Colonel Utsunomiya, Mori, and Majors Hayashi; six representatives from the Navy: Lieutenant Colonels Kawa, Shikata, and Mifune; representatives from the Police Department: Police Chief Major Bowen, Deputy Chief Captain Schmoull, and Robertson, Assistant Office Superintendent Samson, Special Deputy Chief Akagi Chikashi, and Deputy Chief Uehara Ban.

Responsibility for Delay

The French-language Shanghai Daily reported yesterday that during a Japanese news conference on the issue of returning police power in the Northern District, a foreign reporter asked, "Regarding the return of the management of the districts north of the Suzhou River to the Municipal Council, an agreement was reached on March 1, why has it not been implemented yet? Should the Japanese side be held responsible for this delay?" At the same time, another reporter asked, "The Japanese side only convened a meeting to return the Northern District of the public concession now, is it because the Municipal Council election is approaching, so it is using it?" However, the Japanese spokesperson smiled and replied at the time, "This is a kind of counter-propaganda from the outside world regarding the Japanese election."

### Shanghai Merchants Leasing Hong Kong Ships – Restrictions on Tonnage

After a portion of British ships in Shanghai were ordered to be requisitioned, the Hong Kong authorities have specially processed applications from shipowners to lease ships in Hong Kong. According to shipping industry news, the Hong Kong authorities now stipulate that the leased ships are limited to small tonnage, and if the British Navy Department needs to requisition them after the lease, they must be sailed back to Hong Kong at any time.

### Tuberculosis Prevention Campaign – Last Week – More Than 2,000 People Examined by X-ray – Lung Disease Found in One-Quarter

The tuberculosis prevention campaign jointly launched by leaders from all walks of life in this city began on the 15th of last month and held a large-scale tuberculosis prevention examination at the Hongqiao Sanatorium. After the detection of lesions, free X-ray photography and sputum examination were provided. The method was unprecedented and created a new record in tuberculosis prevention in various countries. Citizens who went for examination were very enthusiastic. Up to yesterday, more than 2,000 people had been examined, and lung disease was found in more than 500 people, accounting for one-quarter of the total. One-sixth of the total number of patients was already beyond salvation. The detection and eradication of such latent tuberculosis and sources of tuberculosis bacteria is urgently needed by the isolated island public health. However, the association is limited by manpower and resources, and will announce its closure on the 15th of this month. It is heard that the free X-ray photos were donated by major philanthropists, and all the registration fees collected due to the limitation of the number of people will be allocated to the conference by the Hongqiao Sanatorium to be used for all the expenses of this tuberculosis prevention campaign, such as publicity. The enthusiasm for public welfare of the hospital is admirable. It is hoped that it will continue to contribute to this tuberculosis prevention work in the future and benefit the citizens.

### Municipal Council Chairman Facklering – Inspects the Shanghai Volunteer Corps – About 2,000 People Participated in the Inspection – The Program Includes Three Types of Arrangements, Formations, and Processions

### Evacuate Refugees in Shanghai – Planned – Reception Centers Economically Strained – Plan to Send Out of the Country in Batches

The North China Daily News reported that, according to reliable sources, the weather is getting warmer and fundraising is difficult, so the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association is planning to evacuate refugees to reduce the burden. Shanghai currently has approximately 40,000 Chinese refugees who rely entirely on relief for food and clothing, which requires

300,000 Yuan

per month to maintain. However, the association's funds are approximately 40,000 yuan short each month. According to a member of the association, the evacuation is just a plan and there is no definite action yet. Currently, Chinese refugees in Shanghai are taken care of by the association and its branches. Chairman Chu Qiaqing, in addition to fundraising to maintain directly affiliated refugees, must also provide food to other smaller reception centers. The association's branch cares for approximately 9,000 refugees in the reception centers, and the economy is also strained. Therefore, the association plans to

to the extent possible

evacuate the refugees and complete the work by the end of June. There are many refugees who voluntarily request to leave the center. Most of these people are from the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, who came to Shanghai with their families to escape the war, and now want to return home. The association plans to issue travel expenses if necessary. The first to be evacuated are the refugees who can support themselves, most of whom are peddlers and workers from the suburbs of Shanghai or nearby areas. The strong and strong will also be evacuated first, but the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphans will still be taken in. Relief workers in this city plan to focus on the education of orphans left behind by refugees after the relief of refugees is over.

### Japanese Soldiers Searched Northern District A of the Suzhou River Again Yesterday

Since the opening of Hongkou in Northern District A of the Suzhou River, the Japanese soldiers patrolling have decreased, and the residents have gradually calmed down. Suddenly, at 2:10 PM yesterday (9th), several armed Japanese soldiers in black uniforms holding rifles entered Dexingli on the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Wenjianshi Road to inspect and interrogate pedestrians. As a result, they gained nothing, and those who were inspected were all frightened.

### Pudong Public Transportation Industry Taken Over by Japanese

The "Central China Motor Bus Company," an investment organization of the Japanese side, is actively controlling transportation businesses in various places. In addition to other locations, the company has also operated several bus lines in the Hongkou, Jiangwan, and downtown areas of Shanghai, as well as the circular road in the Nanshi area. It is now learned that the company will further control the two bus lines in Pudong. The "Avenue Public Works Bureau" once operated three "bus" lines in Pudong: one from Dongchang Road to Shangnan Railway, one from Dongchang Road to Yangjing, and one from Gaoqiao Wharf to the seaside bathing beach. All vehicles were abandoned by the Municipal Public Works Bureau before the war. Later, the Dongchang Road to Shangnan Railway line was suspended due to a damaged body, leaving only two lines. Originally, the plan was to continue to profit from them, but the Central China Company, under the pretext of economic cooperation, took over all the "Pudong Bus Factory site vehicles, movable and immovable property" run by the "Avenue Public Works Bureau" the day before yesterday. From yesterday onwards, the business rights belong to Central China, and fares have also been increased uniformly. All "companies" opened by "Avenue" closed their doors yesterday, and all employees were dismissed.

### Aluminum Subsidiary Coins to Circulate in Shanghai Today Approved by the Shanghai Banking Association for Minting and Issuance; Issued by the Association and HSBC Bank

Since the subsidiary coin panic occurred in this city last year, although multiple batches of fractional notes have been issued to meet market needs, they are still in short supply. The Shanghai Banking Association, in view of this, has discussed minting one-cent and five-cent aluminum coins to supplement the issuance for regulation. It is heard that these subsidiary coins can be circulated in the market today, and it is learned that those belonging to foreign merchants will collect from HSBC Bank, while those belonging to silver firms will collect from the Banking Association. Both will be fully prepared with legal tender without discount, and will be used in the same way as one-cent and five-cent subsidiary notes. It is expected that the market will no longer feel the lack of subsidiary coins in the future.

Issued Today

A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the financial community yesterday that the Ministry of Finance has revised the Subsidiary Coin Regulations, and the central mint has started minting new one-cent, two-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent subsidiary coins. The one-cent and two-cent coins are made of copper-zinc alloy, and the five-cent and ten-cent coins are made of copper-nickel-zinc alloy. They have been issued and circulated in the market since January 1st. As for the aluminum one-cent and five-cent new subsidiary coins in Shanghai, they were proposed by the Shanghai Banking Association and approved by the Ministry of Finance for minting. They have been minted, shipped to Shanghai, and will be issued by the Banking Association and HSBC Bank from today.

Number of Transactions

It is heard that aluminum subsidiary coins are calculated decimally. The number of coins equivalent to one yuan of legal tender is as follows: (1) twenty five-cent subsidiary coins, one hundred one-cent subsidiary coins. The number of transactions is in accordance with the Subsidiary Coin Regulations. The maximum transaction for five-cent subsidiary coins is twenty yuan of legal tender each time, and the maximum transaction for one-cent subsidiary coins is five yuan of legal tender each time. However, the collection and exchange of taxes are not subject to this restriction. As for the preparation of aluminum subsidiary coins, it is a full amount of legal tender, without discount, and will be used in the same way as fractional notes. The one-cent and five-cent fractional notes issued by the Central Bank will be temporarily suspended from further issuance.

### Robbery of Huge Sum of Money on Qiujiang Road, Hongkou Yesterday, a Shipment from Changzhou Xiangfeng Exchange Was Robbed of 196,000 Yuan in Legal Tender

At around 0:40 PM yesterday, at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Sichuan Road in Hongkou, a business car was intercepted by bandits, and a huge sum of 196,000 yuan in legal tender was robbed. The details are as follows:

Shipment to Shanghai

Changzhou Xiangfeng Exchange does not have a branch in Shanghai, but has been in contact with Huiyuan Silver House at 94 Ranbo Road for many years. Yesterday morning around 9 AM, a large batch of cash, totaling 196,000 yuan in legal tender, was packed in leather suitcases and entrusted to two shop assistants to transport to Shanghai by train, to be deposited into Huiyuan Silver House. Around noon, when the train arrived at Wuxi Station, Manager Ji of Huiyuan Silver House in Shanghai happened to be on the same train and greeted them in the carriage.

Bandit Interception

At around 0:40 PM, the train arrived at the North Station. Ji and the two partners from Xiangfeng boarded the car and hired a business car from the station's Dada Car Company, instructing the driver to drive to Huiyuan Silver House on Ningbo Road. When passing the intersection of Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road in Zhabei, four bandits suddenly emerged from the side of the road. Three of them held handguns, blocked the road, and forced the car to stop. Three bandits crowded into the car, while another bandit held a gun and monitored the driver, forcing him to drive straight to Hongkou. When they arrived at the intersection of Yalu Road and Yuanfang Road, the bandits threatened the victims and the driver to get out of the car, and another bandit drove the car eastward.

Police Investigation

After Ji and the others were driven out of the car, they regained their composure and reported to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to the scene to investigate everything. The two partners from Xiangfeng Exchange were taken to the police station, and after the police chief's strict inquiry, due to the seriousness of the case, Chinese and foreign detectives were ordered to search for the bandits and bring them to justice. As of press time, the car driven away by the bandits had not been found.

### Schoolboy Killed by Car

Frenchman Pei Ai (transliteration), the head of the French Bicycle Company, left the company at 12:15 PM on the 9th, riding his own car No. 7200, driven by driver Peng Chaohua, back to his residence. When the car was driving on the Lvbans Road at the intersection of Ximen Road, heading north from the south, Zhou Zuomin (12 years old, from Shanghai, resident of No. 24 Xinmin Village, Malang Road), a male student of Fuchun Elementary School at No. 157 Lane 1, Lvbans Road, was going to school after lunch. He crossed the road from east to west and was unable to avoid the car, causing his head to be hit by the left fender of the car and injured. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died at 2:30 PM before he could be treated.

### Gu Huanzhang Kidnapped on Kang Nao Tuo Road the Night Before; Accountant Lu Guowei Also Kidnapped

A kidnapping case occurred on Kang Nao Tuo Road the night before. Whether it contains political implications is still unknown. Gu Huanzhang, a local, is 47 years old and resides in a foreign house at No. 1097 on that road. He usually runs Guchun Shoe Store and Gongyi Leather Factory on Hubei Road. He usually owns a private car No. 5147, driven by driver Shen Shu. At 10:30 PM the night before, Gu was invited by a friend to a brothel in Huile Lane on Fuzhou Road. After drinking and the party broke up, Gu and accountant Lu Guowei boarded the car to return home. At that time, three men in short clothes, ambushed in the Jin Situ Temple Lane near Gu's house, jumped out when they saw Gu's car and drove the driver out with guns, speeding away and disappearing. After reporting to the police station for investigation, it was heard that Gu had received threatening letters before the incident.

### Injury Doctor's Clinic Sued for Eviction; Appeal Hearing Concluded, Awaiting Judgment

Qin Meifang, an injury doctor, has his clinic located at No. 56 Ningbo Road. Recently, he was sued in the Civil Court of the First Special Court by Wei Dingpu, the small owner of the Weiqingji Construction Factory, his landlord, requesting eviction. The reason is that he wanted to take it back for his own use. The first instance ruled that Qin Meifang lost the case. Qin refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Yan Yin to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court, stating the reasons for the appeal and requesting that the original judgment be revoked and the plaintiff's request in the first instance be rejected. According to the lease in dispute between the two parties, it is an indefinite lease. In this extraordinary period, all courts carefully consider cases involving indefinite leases, because in Shanghai today, the demand for rental housing exceeds the supply, and tenants really have nowhere to find housing, while landlords deliberately fabricate reasons to sue in the name of taking back the property for their own use, hoping to replace it with a new tenant and absorb huge rents. The court sees through their tricks, and eviction suits are not easily granted, so the safety of citizens can be guaranteed. It is found that eviction incidents are often based on Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code. However, the second half of that paragraph clearly stipulates that habits favorable to the tenant must be taken into account. If they conflict with habits favorable to the tenant, there is no reason to grant eviction. Now, the plaintiff's claim to take it back for his own use is completely false, and it is actually due to a failed rent increase. It is found that the plaintiff's entire family consists of only six people, and they now live in seven large rooms upstairs, which means that each person occupies a room alone, which is more than enough. Why should he seek other arrangements? Moreover, in addition to the bedroom, the plaintiff also has a reception room and a storage room, and rents the three-bay main hall in the rear of the downstairs, the front and rear unified rooms of the west wing downstairs, and the two large rooms on the west side downstairs to Zhang Dongming's wine shop. Therefore, even if he wants to take it back for his own use, he should make a claim against Zhang Dongming, and there is no reason to order the appellant, who lives in the east wing downstairs, to evict. How can a judgment of eviction be in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code? Based on the above facts and reasons, he requested that the original judgment be revoked and that the plaintiff's request in the first instance be dismissed. The costs of litigation in both instances should be borne by the appellee. Yesterday morning, the civil court of the Second Branch of the High Court held a hearing on this case and concluded the hearing. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 15th.

### Kidnapping of a Young Actor Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months

Zhou Xisheng, a six-year-old boy named Wenzhao, who lived in Changzhou and ran a plank box shop on Robertsen Road, was abducted on the afternoon of the 10th of last month by Xu Ronghu, a former apprentice in Zhou Xisheng's copper shop, and Xu Genda, a fellow apprentice who was on the run. They were hidden in Changzhou and wrote a letter demanding a ransom of 50,000 yuan. The case was discovered, and they were arrested and sent to the First Special Court. Zhou's family sent someone to Changzhou to retrieve the child. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested strict punishment for Xu, the apprentice, for using kidnapping to extort money. The order was received to await sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang came to the Third Criminal Court to pronounce the verdict, sentencing Xu Ronghu to three years and six months in prison as a warning.

### Spring Returns to the Earth, Gentle Breeze Blowing, the Weather is Warm, and Parks are Crowded with Tourists

The spring has returned to the earth in this city recently, and the weather is gradually becoming warmer. According to the forecast of the Astronomical Observatory, it will become even warmer recently, and due to the change of wind direction, a gentle breeze will blow all day long. The temperature is always above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Residents have taken off their heavy fur coats and changed to single-layer clothes. The parks are crowded with tourists. However, due to the impact of the cross-border road construction this year, the number of tourists to Zhaofeng Park has decreased.

### The Case of Overdraft of US Optical Factory's Collateral Continued to be Heard Yesterday, Proving that the Appropriation Slip Was Indeed Claimed by US Optical

The case in which Xu Shihao and Zuo De, lawyers formerly employed by Zhejiang Industrial Bank, sued the US Optical Dyeing and Weaving Factory in the Civil Court of the First Special Court for collateral and overdraft, and demanded the recovery of 70,000 yuan in appropriation slips has been reported by this newspaper after two summonses by Judge Mo Jianhua. Yesterday afternoon, it was time for the hearing again. Ye Jingkui, the former general manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and lawyers Xu and Zuo appeared in court. Jiang Yanwu, the manager of the defendant US Optical, and the guarantor Tang Yanxiu did not appear and were represented by lawyer Qian Jialong. First, the plaintiff's lawyer Xu Shihao stated:

All the witnesses the plaintiff requested to be summoned were in court. Judge Mo then summoned witness Zhang Qidong to testify. He was an employee in the current deposit department of Zhejiang Industrial Bank. On June 29 last year, Tang Yanxiu, the deputy manager of US Optical Factory, came to collect the money with the 70,000 yuan check. At that time, due to a temporary mistake, I gave him a blank appropriation slip. Before long, I suddenly remembered that after the Ministry of Finance's Ma Dian restricted withdrawals, the manager's office had notified that customers with outstanding debts should use deposits to offset debts.

I realized my mistake

Because Tang was an old classmate, I rushed to Tang to ask him to return the appropriation slip. Because Tang insisted on not returning it, I had no choice but to report it to the manager's office, and the manager's office sent a letter to the check clearing house to stop payment. At this point, lawyer Xu Shihao stated that the appropriation slip not only proves that it was claimed by US Optical Factory, but also knows that the factory paid it to Zhejiang Industrial Bank for the German-character company's pigment collateral. This point can be proven by witness Jiang Yizhi. Then Jiang Yizhi testified that he was from Xingye Bank

Managing Director

The defendant Jiang Yanwu is my grand-nephew. Last July, I returned to Shanghai from Beiping and learned about this matter. According to the report, I knew that the appropriation slip was claimed by the US Optical Factory. We were all our own people, so I tried my best to mediate. Because the US Optical Factory paid the appropriation slip to Zhejiang Industrial Bank for the De Fuyuan pigment collateral, and it was stopped for payment, I thought it was a loss of face, so it was difficult to reach a settlement. Also, according to witnesses Yan Ouke, the supervisor of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhang Dusheng, the director, and Xu Jiluo, the managing director,

Further Proof

All said that the appropriation slip was claimed by the US Optical Factory itself, and Jiang also personally came to the bank to discuss and requested accommodation, etc. Finally, Ye Jingkui, the chairman and general manager, said that the appropriation slip was actually mistakenly paid by the staff in a hurry. Because after receiving the Ma Dian from the Ministry of Finance, all customers were required to use deposits to offset debts. The plaintiff had informed the defendant of the regulations. The defendant knew that the deposit had been used to offset the debt and actually signed a check for 70,000 yuan to withdraw from the bank. Although it was mistakenly paid by the bank clerk, this deposit had been used to offset the debt, and the bank

Naturally Stopped Payment

In order to clarify the truth, lawyer Xu Shihao requested the court to obtain the account books and vouchers related to the Shengji account from Zhejiang Industrial Bank to prove the relationship between US Optical and Shengji and the purpose of the 70,000 yuan appropriation slip. Whether Shengji and US Optical were one and the same, or two different entities. The defendant's lawyer Qian said that all those who attended the court today are directors and staff, and cannot be regarded as witnesses. It can only be said that the party asked the party to conclude, and there is no precedent for this. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing.

### Adulterer Injures His Wife and Her Husband Cui Sun's Self-Inflicted Injury, Also Injured in Several Places by Her Lover

Cui Dengjie, a native of Pudong, is 27 years old and works as a mason. He and his wife, Cui Sun (25 years old this year), live at No. 1783 Robertsen Road, Shanghai West. Cui is usually away working, so the relationship between husband and wife is not very satisfactory. Therefore, Sun has an affair. The night before, after Cui returned from Nanjing, Yang Rongde, his wife Sun's lover, suddenly became jealous. Suddenly, at 6:20 AM yesterday morning, while Cui and his wife were still in bed, he broke into the room with a knife and chopped Cui's head, and also injured Cui Sun's forehead and lips. The murderer Yang Rongde saw that his goal had been achieved and fled the scene. Later, the residents of the neighborhood reported to the police, and Cui and his wife were taken to the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road for treatment. At the same time, the police station sent detectives to arrest Yang. He was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer said that the victim was still in the hospital and could not appear in court, so he requested an adjournment. Judge Huang took the seat and interrogated the defendant, who admitted that he had injured him because of jealousy and anger. After verifying the words, the court ordered that the hearing be adjourned for seven days.

### Turtle Trademark Lawsuit Concluded on Appeal, Date Set for Verdict

The Hu Gui Xiong Lu kidney tonic pills (also known as Fugui Ronglu kidney tonic pills) issued by Chen Taiyan of Meiling Pharmacy were registered with the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and held Approval No. 28540, and were published in the Official Gazette. Moreover, after the issuance, they were repeatedly advertised in newspapers and were well known to the public. Last year, Han Longzhou of Liuzhou Pharmacy was sued because the kidney tonic pills produced by him had a picture of a large black turtle on the box, and the Hu Gui Xiong Lu tonic pills issued by Chen Taiyan also had a small turtle on the box, which was suspected of imitation. He filed a criminal self-prosecution with the First District Court. The first instance had already ruled that Chen Taiyan was not guilty. Han Longzhou refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal again. Yesterday, Zhou Han, the president of the Second Branch of the High Court, summoned both parties to court for a hearing. Chen Taiyan, the appellee, hired three lawyers, Qian Xingzhong, Zhu Qichao, and Huang Huancheng, to defend him. After Zhou, the president, carefully examined the documentary evidence, he ordered the debate to be concluded and set a date for the verdict.

Her family thought she had an epidemic disease and sent her to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Aiduya Road at 10 PM that night. Because the poisoning was too deep, she died despite treatment.

A fire broke out in a grass shed in Nanyaojiage, Zhaofeng Garden, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai West, at around 6 AM.

### Two Shareholders Found Not Guilty in Yongsheng Rice Store Fraud Case Xue Caizhang and Xu Runlin Still at Large

Yongsheng Rice Store at No. 7, Lane 466, Tianjin Road, had previously ordered a large quantity of rice from Qingfeng, Qingyuan, Xiemao, Rendashun, Yisheng, and Shunfeng rice stores. After taking delivery of the goods, the payment was not paid, and the store announced its closure and liquidation. In total, the rice defrauded from the above stores was worth approximately 50,000 yuan. Xue Caizhang, the manager of the store, and Xu Runlin, the assistant manager,

Escaped Without a Trace

Qingfeng and others commissioned lawyer Wu Linkun to report to the Laozha Police Station. Chinese detective Guo Ruiquan obtained a copy of the Yongsheng partnership agreement from the Rice Store Association and learned that the shareholders of the store, in addition to Xue Caizhang, also included Tong Shouchcheng and Wang Xingsheng. According to the complainants, Tong Shouchcheng is Tong Zongyao, the owner of Shenyangtai Rice Store at No. 278, Lafayette Road, and Wang Xingsheng is Wang Xingsen, the owner of Longsheng Rice Store at No. 565, Sichuan Road. The police then

Detained Tong and Wang

and sent them to the First Special Court, ordering each to pay 30,000 yuan for bail. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the Fourth Court for a continued hearing on this case. Wang Xingsen hired Wang Yaotang and Tao Wuzhi, and Tong Zongyao hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend them. Xu Yesun, the witness to the Yongsheng partnership agreement, also appeared in court accompanied by lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang. The police lawyer Peng Qiqi stated that the police are prosecuting under Article 237 of the Criminal Code for fraud. Today, the witnesses to the agreement, Fu Qiangeng and Xu Yesun,

Are in Court to Testify

etc. First, Fu Yuan Geng testified that before Xu Runlin and others organized Yongsheng, they had talked to me about it and then invited me to be a witness. When the agreement was signed, the so-called shareholders Tong Shouchcheng and Wang Xingsen did not come to the scene. Only Xu Runlin represented them and stamped the agreement and paid the shares. Therefore, neither of the two defendants came to the scene before or after the event. Xu Yesun's statement was the same as Fu's and stated that the participation of Tong and Wang in the Yongsheng organization was only hearsay and had not been witnessed. Wang Xingsen

Completely Denied

that he had ever negotiated or actually participated in any matters related to Yongsheng before or after the event. Moreover, Wang Xingsen in the agreement was different, and the seal was not consistent. This time, he was unjustly wronged. Tong Zongyao completely denied the name of Tong Shouchcheng and stated that he had never participated in the organization of Yongsheng. After Judge Liao verified the testimony, he ordered the debate to begin. After mutual debate by the lawyers on both sides, the court announced the conclusion and ruled that Wang Xingsen and Tong Zongyao were not guilty.

### Old Newspaper Excerpts Sixty-Seven Years Ago (350)

(From a copy of this newspaper from the twelfth year of the reign of Tongzhi of the late Qing Dynasty)

Returning the Calligraphy to its Origin

At Plum Blossom Ridge in Guangling, there was formerly the clothing and hat tomb of the Ming Dynasty official, Minister Shi Kefa. During the Qianlong reign, Vice Minister Peng Yuanrui obtained the public portrait of the official and respectfully presented it for the Emperor's inspection. He was posthumously awarded the title "Zhongzheng" (Loyal and Upright), and a shrine was built and repaired. The Emperor composed poems and essays, and the officials harmonized their rhymes. By imperial decree, these were engraved on stone tablets on the shrine walls to encourage loyalty among officials. Sacrifices were offered by officials every spring and autumn, a grand ceremony. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns, after the ravages of war, the shrine and the inscriptions were completely destroyed. Recently, it was learned that Shi Zhaolin, a descendant of the official, believing that the virtuous deeds of his ancestors should not be forgotten, specially requested the local officials to donate funds to repair the tomb and build the shrine, and to reprint his posthumous works. A traveler passing by saw that the plum trees and stones were gradually restored to their original appearance, but the Imperial Stele Pavilion had not yet been rebuilt. In front of the tomb is a cannon, made during the Chongzhen reign, cast by the Ministry of War's Grand Hall. It is thought to be a relic from the wartime. It was previously unearthed by a magistrate of a certain county when digging a moat. Now, Zhaolin has also requested its return, intending to preserve it in the shrine, a reminder of the touch of history. Furthermore, at a mounting shop in Shanghai, he obtained two texts: a reading of Minister Shi Kefa's essay from the year Wuzi, and the dedication and memorial oration drafted by his disciple Ge Ning, along with a thousand-word poem, in imitation of the Plum Blossom Ridge painting scroll. Also, he saw a small portrait in Zhu Yi (red official robe) of the Minister, admired by Mr. Gu Nanya when he was the head of the Plum Blossom Hospital, upon which was written the Imperial poems and annotations. Moreover, the shop owner presented a hundred pieces of the Minister's handwritten letters, seals, military documents, and reports, truly rare treasures. It is said that Zhaolin obtained all of these in Shanghai last winter, purchasing the memorial essays and small portraits back at a high price. The shrine map scroll had long been collected by Cai Jun Luqing of Ningbo, and Zhaolin obtained it through earnest entreaty. That these items could still return to the Shi family after two hundred years is due to the diligent searching of the descendants, but also to the silent protection of the gods, allowing them to survive the ravages of war unscathed. Furthermore, Zhaolin also purchased ten scrolls of the Minister's personally written family precepts. The instructions are sincere and the calligraphy is elegant. Connoisseurs of antiquities especially love to keep them.

Spring and Autumn

### Human Hell: A Quick Sketch of "Noodle" Addicts' Nest

— Lu Yu

When the earth is filled with the spirit of spring, and everything awakens from slumber, the group of people on the north bank of Suzhou Creek who regard inhaling "white noodles" (also known as heroin) as their second life will once again become active. In this narrow, filthy alley filled with garbage and excrement, constantly permeated with a suffocating, moldy odor, they have once again taken possession. Like a flock of swallows, when spring returns, they follow and return to their old nest where they once lingered for a time.

Thus, the yurt-like nests once again enter our field of vision. These simple structures, with one side facing the wall and the other three sides and the top covered with broken mats, are huddled together, totaling seven in number. About three feet high, they can generally accommodate three or four people. During the day, one can often see three or four people huddled around a candle stub, bending over and greedily inhaling the bloodless killer "white noodles" from tin foil through a thick paper rolled into a tube.

They are almost all equally thin and tattered, proving that their flesh and blood have been completely absorbed by this poison. Only a shell supported by a layer of skin and a few bones remains, tottering in and out busily.

Whenever they receive a small paper packet from the Korean dealer (seller of white noodles), it is as if they have obtained a rare treasure. A wave of joy sweeps across their thin and filthy faces. This means that their sole purpose in life is built upon this small packet of grace.

However, what is strange is that in these times of rising rice prices, when people cannot even manage to fill their stomachs, where do they get the money to maintain their "white noodle" habit? Moreover, it is not a small sum (according to them, each person has to consume two packets of white noodles a day, divided into three doses, at a price of two jiao per packet). This is something that everyone would be surprised by, right? But if you just ask the residents of our alley, they will tell you the source.

Originally, their main base is in the vegetable market by the Old Zhabei Bridge. Taking advantage of the busy trade, when people are bustling around and have no time to pay attention, they use their skilled and agile methods to snatch some vegetables or other food, and then sell it at a cheap price. Therefore, a humorous saying, "Old Zhabei Bridge is their savings bank," is popular in our alley.

However, when using this method, if they happen to be caught by the owner of the stolen goods, then a beating is hard to avoid. Fists and feet rain down on them, and they use words that are unbelievably humble to beg for mercy. But as soon as they turn around, they are doing the same thing again, perhaps receiving the same beating again. Heavens! What magic is driving them? It can be said that they have no soul, no flesh, and apart from "white noodles," they have nothing else to cherish in this world.

Besides the Old Zhabei Bridge, at other times, anything worth a few coins and easy to carry is liable to be stolen by them. Especially the residents of this alley, who must be constantly vigilant, otherwise, if you are not careful, you will quickly find something missing.

I once asked an older "white noodle" addict about the reason why he became addicted to "white noodles." I had been wondering for many days why so many people would approach "white noodles," which contains such deep poison. I thought that perhaps they had special difficulties. But this old man did not answer me according to my question. He just muttered that he used to be from a good family, but ever since he became addicted to "white noodles," he was reduced to ruin and his family was scattered. Now, it is too late to regret it. Finally, he said, "Ah! Sir, this is the debt we owed to the ×× people in our previous life, so we have to repay them piecemeal in this life. You don't know, it doesn't matter if you go hungry for a few days, but when the craving for "white noodles" comes, it is truly worse than death!"

Indeed, what we should not overlook here are the tall Korean men who stroll back and forth at the entrance of the alley every afternoon, two or three of them. They all wear pretty suits and carry a small cloth bag in their hands. When each trembling and filthy hand stretches out a few coins to them, what a triumphant look shines on their swarthy faces.

I remember that last year, there was one time when they were taken away by the "black car," but in a few days, they came back again, with an even more triumphant and arrogant smile on their faces, as if saying, "What? Do you think that would work? We're back!" Who doesn't know that they have even more powerful backers?

The old ones disappear, and new ones fill their place. In this small alley, this kind of metabolism is always taking place. Every day, there are always a few new faces swaying before my eyes. Some even wear relatively neat clothes when they first come, but in a few days, they are also reduced to the same state. What a terrible policy of poisoning! Will the will of our nation really sink so low? I wonder fearfully, although I also feel that this is superfluous.

Here, we can only earnestly hope that the security authorities can come up with an active and effective method to help those who are immersed in the sea of suffering to escape. At the same time, this is also of great relevance to the security of the concession.

### The Principles of Being a Person: An Early Sweep Through Examinations, Books, Vegetables, Fish, and Pigs

— Qiang Gong

Recently, during a public banquet given by the Chongqing authorities for national representatives of people's education, President Jiang, in his speech, mentioned the eight words Zeng Wenzhenggong taught his children: "Old, Treasure, Early, Sweep, Books, Vegetables, Fish, Pigs," urging today's students to put effort into these eight words, and that every school, according to this principle, should consider the environment and objective circumstances, and find ways to implement them, and so on. This is truly a principle of being a person that everyone should follow.

These eight words are very clear and need no explanation. In short, they mean "benevolence and cherishing things." The aim is to teach people to get close to everyday life, and to seek the principles of being a person in everyday life.

Every word in these eight words is achievable. In the past, everyone seemed to have overlooked these eight aspects. By overlooking these eight words, we can also say that they have not truly come into contact with everyday life. Without contact with everyday life, then perhaps they have not yet engaged in being a person, but seem to be acting like "supermen" (referring to those who have transcended the realm of humans). This is a point of meaning that we should repent and work hard to pay attention to in these eight words.

Many past facts tell us that students only knew how to study, and forgot the truth of "learning for application." They only knew how to live an empty life, and did not pay attention to practical life. It seemed as if the students studying at school were separate from the people outside the school. Therefore, as soon as students leave school, they are simply overwhelmed, feeling lost. After a round of applause of "great prospects" sends them out of the school gate, they are immediately left aside by society, with no way forward. Even if they are not rejected, they are quite frustrated on the road. Theory, righteousness, outline, oral records, quotations, definitions, laws, etc., without everyday life, how to handle the first step of entering society, how to melt the great principles from books into society, this has formed many informed people's deep feelings of "educational grounding."

The central idea here is not to tell students to despise knowledge, but to ask students to value practical knowledge, read a sentence of classics, read a few lines of text, read a few volumes of books, and not be empty. On the one hand, seek learning, on the other hand, investigate things. This is to make the country's intention of cultivating people useful to everyone. The eight words only urge people to pay attention to one aspect of everyday life, and from this to further enrich the principles of being a person and dealing with the world.

### After the Rain Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 22 News Takes Flight from Beyond the Horizon, Revered Opinions and Grand Arguments Are Human Beliefs

Jin Danyu did not want to take the seat, but Shao Huihua pulled her and pressed her into the seat. One should not underestimate Shao Huihua. She is not tall, but she has strength. Her father taught her some soft martial arts. Two or three strong men are nothing to her. If it were in the seven or eight years before the war in China, when martial arts novels were popular, Shao Huihua would have been portrayed as a chivalrous woman. However, Qu Wushuang's invitation today can be considered a "one thing, two purposes" affair. One is to welcome Jin Danyu and her new marriage; the other is that she is connecting with this group of progressive women. Besides Shao Huihua, who is from this newspaper office, the other women can also pick up a pen and write an article. For example, invite Zhu Airen to write some medical opinions, the He sisters to write some textile opinions, Wu Junsu to write some educational opinions, and Jin Danyu, with her extensive experience, can also express opinions on European and American society and social interactions. These are all needed for her "Women's Garden" column and the "Women's Life" magazine that she edits. In fact, these expenses are all paid by the newspaper office and do not require Miss Qu Wushuang to pay out of her own pocket. That is what is called entertainment expenses. A large newspaper office like this has entertainment expenses included in its legitimate expenses every year. Therefore, their large restaurant almost invites guests there every day. It is certainly not like the newspaper industry in China twenty years ago, where news reporters were often invited to other people's banquets, but news reporters rarely invited others. Let's say that Qu Wushuang invited them to eat Western food today, but the materials are all native to China. Even all the utensils are domestically made. Moreover, this newspaper office is even more particular. All the porcelain basins, knives and forks, napkins, etc. are custom-made and have the name of the newspaper office on them. Even the cigarettes and matchboxes given to guests have the name of the newspaper office printed on them. This restaurant has two kinds of dishes, one is Chinese and the other is Western, according to each person's preferences. However, most of the materials are domestic products, and only a very small amount are imported, which are just canned foods. During their banquet, they talked freely. Zhu Airen said, "I didn't expect our country's news industry to develop so quickly. When I was a child, I heard my grandfather talk about how Chinese newspapers were oppressed to the point of suffocation during the war, but they still have this day. At that time, I heard my grandfather say that three people ran a newspaper office. One person was in charge of editing, one person was in charge of printing, and one person was in charge of distribution. But their newspaper was run very well. Especially their newspaper office's assets, which when mentioned, would really make people laugh, were only one dan (a unit of weight), which could be carried on the shoulder." (261)

### The Lessons of Trees (Arbor Day) (2)

(3) Bearing Fruit. The standard value of a tree lies in bearing fruit, not in just growing tall and large. We look at people in the same way. We should not look at their height, appearance, education, status, and wealth, but at what they do. Their deeds are the fruits borne by their spirit. Although a tree may be large, in our view, it is not as good as a fruit-bearing tree, because the latter bears fruit while the former does not. (4) Implication. A father said to his son, "Take the fruit of a tree and cut it open to see what's inside." The son replied, "There's only a seed." The father said, "Cut open the seed to see what's inside." The son said, "There's nothing." The wise father said, "Son, you say there's nothing, but you're wrong. There's a big tree inside!" This lesson is to say that regardless of the size of the fruit, it contains life inside. This life is most precious. Speaking of our rich life, if we do not make progress and cannot bear fruit, we are just occupying the land in vain, which is a great shame to our enemies. (5) Obligation. When a tree grows into lumber, it is sent to a sawmill to be sawn into various materials. This is its original service to the people. It can be used to build mansions, bridges, utensils, and make all kinds of tools. The value of a tree lies in the fact that it does not exist for itself, but in serving others. People should also be like this. Why was Jesus crucified? In a nutshell, it was for the people. His death enabled the sins of the world to be forgiven, and he became one with God the Father. Therefore, we should not live solely for ourselves. We have obligations to the world. In short, trees are the most useful things, and we should learn from trees the lessons of being a person. Please pay attention, everyone. "He himself bore our sins" in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; "by his wounds you have been healed." (The end) (If you want to study the Gospel, please send your letter to No. 1227)

### Thoughts After Watching "The Peach Blossom Spring"

— Xiao Tian

Yu Sheng'an said that writing articles is like a lion playing with an embroidered ball. There is only one ball, but the lion exerts all its skills, circling left and right, right and left, never letting go, but not grabbing it either. However, the lion's rolling this way and that way is all for the ball (the general idea is like this). I say that playwriting and acting should also adopt this method.

"The Peach Blossom Spring" performed by the Great Bell Drama Society has a very thought-provoking theme that strengthens people's faith and can be considered a good allegory drama that awakens the world. Unfortunately, it makes the theme too real, not daring to relax at all, as if the lion has bitten the embroidered ball in its mouth, then what is there to roll? In the final scene of song and dance, several of the girls are quite good-looking, especially the one who plays the flower god, who has a kind of innocence and charm. However, in terms of art, they still feel not very skilled, and the dance poses still feel not beautified enough. The most important thing in acting is to be able to absorb the audience's tense emotions. Indeed, the writing and directing of allegory dramas is more difficult to handle than other types of dramas. In my observation, the members of the Great Bell Society may have more people with profound knowledge than other companies. I very much hope that people with profound knowledge can use the power of art to spread it deeply into the hearts of people at all levels. However, on that day, not only myself and my friends, but the faces of the audience in the theater all revealed a little dull and bored look. I hope that the Great Bell Drama Society can seek further improvement in art. I am confident that this is a well-intentioned and sincere suggestion.

### The Mystery of Bai Yang

— Hua

She hasn't come to Shanghai, but she may come to Hong Kong.

The news of Bai Yang's coming to Shanghai spread as early as last year when Xinhua Company invited them (and Gao Zhanfei) to make a film. However, on the one hand, the China Film Studio had new films waiting to be shot, and on the other hand, if Gao Zhanfei also returned to Shanghai, there would be a little conflict. Therefore, the rumors of Bai Yang and Gao Zhanfei coming to Shanghai, which were once widely spread, finally did not succeed even in the plan of Xinhua to allow them to shoot films in Hong Kong. However, recently, rumors of Bai Yang's return to Shanghai have been spreading again, and it is said that she has already returned (nothing was mentioned about Gao Zhanfei); moreover, that she has been in Shanghai for two or three weeks. This news is naturally unreliable. To speculate, Bai Yang is a famous movie star, and it may be possible for her to come to Shanghai secretly, but to have been in Shanghai for two or three weeks without any "follow-up," it is definitely impossible to "keep it a secret" to this extent. To prove it with facts, the Chongqing Xinshu Bao of March 16 published an advertisement for her and Gu Eryi performing "Frontier Storm," and on the 4th, she acted as a bridesmaid in Wei Heling's wedding, so her coming to Shanghai and Gu Eryi's death were both proven to be untrue.

However, another message has been received from Hong Kong. According to a friend who wrote a letter, "Recently, a certain company (the letter) is in consultation on Bai Yang and Gao Zhanfei coming here (Hong Kong) to shoot films. The extent of the negotiations is not known in detail; I will continue to inform you as soon as there is definite news..."

The so-called "certain company," smart readers may think of which company it is. However, "definite news" is of course in the unknowable realm. From this news, it can be further proven that Bai Yang has not come to Shanghai.

### Miscellaneous Comments on the Wenyi Society's Rehearsal

— Da Gui

The Wenyi Society was founded by Qiu Shouyi and Zhou Guiwen, a married couple. Its predecessor was the Fenghua National Drama Research Society. After the outbreak of the war, it moved to Shanghai and changed its name to the current name. The society held its first rehearsal at the Ningbo Fellow Association the other day. I was invited by a friend to attend and watch. The performances on that day, in addition to the old amateur performers who had been playing for a long time, the new amateur performers who took the stage for the first time also achieved remarkable results. For example, Miss Chen Aihua's performance in "Cosmic Madness," with her lively and skilled gestures and postures when pretending to be crazy, combined both. Miss Chen is very young and tried new sounds for the first time. With these results, it can be seen that she has worked hard. If she practices diligently, her future is very promising. Wang Bingheng and Guan Liping's "Fenhe Bay," Bingheng's Ren Gui is quite adequate. Miss Guan's Yingchun's acting has reached a perfect state, but it is a pity that her voice is not bright, which reduces the charm. Chen Kaitong, Huang Huanong, and Zhang Haishan's "Yellow Crane Tower," Kaitong's Zhou Lang, Huanong's Zilong, and Haishan's Zhang Fei, all seem to be taking the stage for the first time. Huanong's appearance is heroic and martial, and he usually practices a lot, so he is also a promising talent. Kaitong's young man and Haishan's painted face can be called stable. Shu Yanzhai and Lu Linyu's "Empty City Stratagem," Linyu's Sima Zhongda, is a very common pure sound, a copper hammer material among amateur performers. Yanzhai has been in the amateur world for a long time, so he has the courage to perform the entire "Empty City Stratagem." The whole play is performed, which can be considered steady and quiet, but there are a few points in it that I think are worthy of discussion. For example, the introductory song "The four-wheeled cart is as fast as wind and clouds" seems too fast, and the shaking board "Xiao Ma Su lost Jieting, which is hateful" seems too slow. In the Erliu "I am watching the mountain scenery on the city tower," the three words "watching the mountain scenery" seem too low. I asked Mr. Shu what he thought. Wang Yihong has been studying drama for many years, covering all aspects of male, female, painted face, and clown, and has taken the stage many times, so he has considerable experience in the stage. On this day, he performed two plays, one was "Golden Platform" and the other was "Yellow Crane Tower," and the results were above standard. Mr. Wang once said that amateur performers studying opera must study all the main and supporting roles in the play, and even be able to play them all, which is especially helpful for improving the entire drama. Taking this rehearsal as an example, he played Kong Ming in the previous performance of "Yellow Crane Tower," and this time he played Liu Bei. Although he played Tian Dan in "Golden Platform," he also knows all the singing lines and recitations of the Yili role very well. Therefore, for amateur performers learning opera, it is best to explore and practice in many ways to increase the splendor of the entire play, which is indeed one of the things that amateur performers must know.

### A New Art of Entrapment

Since the film "The Invisible Man" caused a sensation in the film world, Universal Pictures has had a plan to shoot "The New Invisible Man." It took a year and cost a lot of money, and finally succeeded. The story of this film is entirely based on "The Invisible Man," and includes things such as prison escape, revenge, and washing away grievances. The whole film is tense and exciting, and in terms of skills, whether it is acting or photography, it is better than "The Invisible Man." The scene of the Invisible Man's appearance at the end is even more valuable for medical physiology. "The New Invisible Man" stars Vincent Price and Nan Grey. The film has arrived in Shanghai and will be premiered at the Grand Shanghai Cinema on the 11th.
