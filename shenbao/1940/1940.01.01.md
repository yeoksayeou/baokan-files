### On New Year's Day, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Addressed and Encouraged the National Public, Determined to Complete the Great Task of National Revival with a Death-Defying Resolution, and Party, Government, and Military Personnel Should Lead by Example and Extend Their Influence to Others

Important News: Since the National Spiritual Mobilization was implemented nationwide, it has been eight months. Today is New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China. Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Spiritual Mobilization Committee, broadcasted encouragement to the nation. The main points are as follows: Everyone, today is New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China, the anniversary of the founding of our Republic of China, and also the first day of the year's work. Our nation's goals in striving together are victory in the war of resistance and success in national reconstruction. Everyone should be determined to dedicate all their strength to ensure the early victory of the war of resistance and the smooth completion of national reconstruction. I am taking this opportunity today to speak to my fellow countrymen about the most important thing related to the survival of the nation, the life and death of the people, and the success or failure of the war of resistance (National Spiritual Mobilization), which I have been advocating for the past year. Everyone knows that spirit is the mother of creating matter and the master of using matter. The power of spirit truly surpasses all material things. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said that weapons are material, but the ability to use weapons depends entirely on spirit. Comparing the two, the power of spirit accounts for nine parts, while the power of matter only accounts for one part. Dr. Sun Yat-sen single-handedly created the great cause of the Chinese Revolution, starting from scratch and building the great Republic of China and the Kuomintang of today. Later, he vowed to launch the Northern Expedition, eliminate warlord obstacles, and complete national unification. None of these achievements were achieved without the triumph of spirit. All of these historical facts are sufficient to prove this. Even in Western countries, it is the same. For example, Germany can be considered the most developed country in terms of material civilization, but Germans often say that Germany not only needs weapons but also the spirit to bear those weapons. Our Chinese material civilization is relatively backward, and we are in this difficult and arduous era. The great cause of the war of resistance and national reconstruction must be achieved during this period. It is truly an unprecedented and serious era in five thousand years of history. Moreover, as far as our war of resistance is concerned, it has already entered its third year. The longer the war lasts, the closer we get to the final victory. Our environment will inevitably become more difficult, more arduous, and more dangerous. We need our entire nation to raise the power of the spirit to overcome all difficulties, overcome all obstacles, and complete the final victory. Therefore, spiritual mobilization is even more important after the start of the new year. We should be even more active in promoting the work of spiritual mobilization in the future. Now, the first thing we need to review is that since the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline was issued on March 12 last year and began to be implemented nationwide on May 1, eight full months have passed. Have the personnel responsible for promoting the National Spiritual Mobilization and the comrades responsible for promoting this movement in various aspects made their best efforts and achieved the expected results? This is really worth studying. Originally, spiritual mobilization is not like material mobilization, which is subject to many conditions. Spirit is possessed by every citizen. As long as they change their minds, they can improve and enhance it. We have been implementing spiritual mobilization for eight months. Eight months cannot be said to be a short time. However, according to the report of the National Spiritual Mobilization Committee, most of the work in various aspects has not been done satisfactorily. For example, Chongqing, a city in the rear, has not achieved the expected results. Some supervisors and hosts of the committee are not responsible at all. Taking Sichuan Province as an example, 27 counties have not yet promoted it. As for spreading it to the countryside and the occupied areas, it has not been achieved at all. We must know that spiritual mobilization means concentrating all will, thought, wisdom, and spiritual strength in one aspect to improve and use it for individuals. For the entire nation, it means concentrating the spiritual strength of all citizens of different ages, occupations, thoughts, and lives on one goal, increasing and developing it, and improving its effectiveness. The focus is on consistency between appearance and reality, and unity from top to bottom, creating a national consensus so as to exert the effect of "utmost greatness and strength." Therefore, it must be universally and deeply rooted in the consciousness of every citizen. Now, the distance from this level is simply immeasurable. Therefore, we can say that the review of these eight months of work has only reached a starting point. In the future, all agencies and personnel responsible for carrying out this movement should quickly stand up and solemnly take on this responsibility. Secondly, I want to tell the people of the whole country that national spiritual mobilization is originally a spontaneous movement. The ancients said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." Today, at this critical moment of the rise and fall of the nation, everyone, with a sense of conscience and ability, should use it to be loyal to the country and to be filial to their ancestors. Everyone should, as the ancients said, "Be ready to die at any time and seek survival in every step." Let us give play to our strength of loyalty and filial piety, break through this life-and-death crisis, and complete the great task of national revival with a death-defying resolution. We should contribute all our time, spirit, intelligence, and even life to the country without reservation. Those with strength should contribute strength, those with money should contribute money. In addition to contributing strength, we should also contribute money. In addition to contributing money, we should also contribute strength. For example, we should universally and practically participate in the expansion of production and conservation movements, and promote the national savings movement from action, giving play to the power of our spirit. As the ancients said, "Where the spirit is, even metal and stone can be opened." Once we have the spirit, one part of matter can be used as ten parts of matter, and we can use the power of spirit to create many new materials. Naturally, we can infinitely strengthen our strength in the war of resistance and national reconstruction. However, everyone should reflect on themselves and ask whether we have established a consistent belief in the Three People's Principles, whether we have practiced the morality of saving the country, whether we have recognized that the country is supreme, the nation is supreme, military affairs are first, victory is first, whether our will is concentrated, our strength is concentrated, and whether we have reached the level of absolute unity between the top and bottom of the country, whether everyone's spiritual strength can be maximized, so that all difficulties and hardships can be overcome, whether we have made up our minds to sacrifice our lives for righteousness and are prepared to face difficulties without hesitation, and whether we can truly fulfill the twelve provisions of the National Covenant with corresponding hearts and consistent risks. Taking advantage of this new year, I ask all our fellow countrymen to deeply reflect on themselves. Thirdly, my fellow countrymen in the occupied areas have suffered all kinds of hardships. I am thinking of them all the time, and I am also urging the soldiers and civilians of the whole country to fight forward and strive to save you and complete our task of resisting the war and building the country. However, many inspiring examples in history were produced in the midst of the most difficult and dangerous environments. Therefore, among all the fellow countrymen, only your steadfast struggle can best demonstrate the great spiritual power of our nation. I can say that our struggle and sacrifice are no less effective than killing enemies and achieving results on the front lines. You especially need to take advantage of this period and this environment to continue the legacy of the martyrs, raise the power of the spirit, and fulfill the great wish of serving the country. Everyone must have a death-defying resolution, especially the fellow countrymen in the occupied areas, to rise up together and jointly complete this great cause. Finally, I want to tell the party, government, military personnel at all levels, and leaders in all aspects of society. You are superior to ordinary fellow countrymen in terms of status and intelligence. You can all play a role in promoting and leading spiritual mobilization, so your responsibility is particularly important. You should "lead by example and extend your influence to others," and strive to correct the bad habits of those who have status, power, and knowledge but are negligent, disrespectful, and despise spiritual work. From today onwards, everyone's personal life must be swept away with the realization of "today is right and yesterday is wrong, today is alive and yesterday is dead" all the past malpractices. If you still have shortcomings such as dishonesty, untruthfulness, lack of seriousness, and lack of tension, you should examine yourself without mercy and correct them immediately. Not only that, but you should further have more enthusiasm and confidence in the work of spiritual mobilization, set an example, and vigorously advocate it. No matter how busy your duties are, you must actively participate and take on the responsibilities you should. In short, spiritual mobilization is the most important thing related to the survival of the nation, the life and death of the people, and the success or failure of the war of resistance. The completion of this great task purely requires everyone to be realistic and lead by example to practice in order to achieve results. Now that the foundation of our victory has been established, the question is whether we can do the two words "certainty" and "action." On this anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, I would like to encourage my colleagues to complete this great task to commemorate the difficulty of creating the Republic of China, to comfort the spirits of the pioneers who created the Republic of China, as well as the soldiers and civilians who died in the war of resistance, and to commemorate our great leader who first created the Republic of China.

### The Chinese Army in Northern Henan Recaptured Wuji Town

Shaanzhou: After Shexian in northern Henan was recovered by the Chinese army, the remnants of the Japanese army collapsed eastward in embarrassment. The Chinese army intercepted them in sections along the way, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. Taking advantage of the victory, the Chinese army pursued and captured the two strongholds of Yetao and Paituo on the morning of the 26th. The Japanese army broke through and collapsed. In Wuji Town, the Chinese army advanced bravely. By the evening, it had recaptured Wuji Town. A part of the remnants of the Japanese army retreated to Wu'an, and another part collapsed towards Anyang. The Chinese army is currently pursuing them in separate ways. (31st report)

Editorial

### A Prospect for the New Year

Lividly before our eyes, and constantly in our thoughts, are a number of important issues that no one can casually dismiss. Some are devious and changeable, making it difficult to foresee a clear resolution. Others are developing vigorously, but only halfway through. There is nothing that we can use to embellish this New Year's Day and say that it has been completed perfectly and deserves to be celebrated. Take China's war of resistance as an example. Victory is within our grasp, and the future is bright, but at the moment, we still need to be vigilant, continue to endure hardships, and be willing to make painful sacrifices. There is nothing to celebrate. The day of celebration is not far away, but it is not today, New Year's Day. However, examining the situation in various aspects, there is still much to be gratified about. The signs are diverse, and the transformation of these signs into clear facts is very likely to be realized in the coming weeks, months, or within this year.

At the moment, the biggest issue is international affairs, and the most important issue in international affairs is war. There are currently three groups of wars: 1. China and Japan, 2. Britain, France, and Germany, 3. Finland and the Soviet Union. Everything about the Soviet Union is often seen as a great mystery by the world, so it is best not to make light judgments about the future of the Finnish-Soviet war. As for the two groups of China and Japan, and Britain, France, and Germany, the military wrangling and maneuvering have been fully exposed to the world from beginning to end. There is no need to repeat them here. However, the fundamental nature of these two groups of problems is far-reaching, subtle, complex, and the key is not limited to military affairs. In other words, military affairs cannot be regarded as their only center of gravity. If news of a battle were to come, saying that one group or another had engaged in a full-scale battle between the main forces of both sides, and the final outcome had been decided, then the fate of the entire problem would be determined by the success or failure of the military. The far-reaching, subtle, and complex problem would be simplified due to military affairs. If this were the case, the problem would be simplified. However, such battle news is currently difficult to imagine. Therefore, while we affirm that "resistance war first, resistance war first" is a golden rule during the current war, we also deeply feel that there are many things outside of the war that cannot be ignored.

Examining the various signs outside the war news, four points are particularly noteworthy: First, although each belligerent country regards the final military victory as the strongest guarantee of national fortune, and therefore spares no effort in military affairs, they are all making multifaceted efforts in the international arena besides striving for the final military victory. The significance of this lies in hoping to win through diplomacy and in hoping to absorb the power of other countries to increase their own combat power and facilitate victory. The various international activities recently reported in international news can all be regarded as the result of the separate efforts of each belligerent country. From this, we can see the fierceness of the efforts of Britain, France, and Germany in this regard. Especially Japan, after two and a half years of fighting, the facts prove that it is absolutely impossible to win militarily, so it makes international efforts its main effort. Recently, Japan's every move towards the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is aimed at coercing China, and it is also a military operation against China. In view of this sign, we can see that they no longer rely on military affairs as the only way to solve international problems. Although the effectiveness of the efforts is unknown, it has been proven that the international power outside the belligerent countries has the possibility of resolving the war from the sidelines. Second, although each neutral country has some degree of closeness, alienation, likes, and dislikes towards each belligerent country, and does not ignore the right and wrong of the causes and responsibilities of the war, recent news not only shows that each neutral country is afraid of falling into the vortex, but also prepares to resolve difficulties based on international morality, wartime trade, and postwar interests. For example, US President Roosevelt and Pope Pius XII have resumed formal diplomatic relations after a seventy-year interruption in China, and are making diligent efforts for peace. Also, the King of Italy held a grand event that has not been seen in thirty years, which is now being carried out a few days after the Pope condemned the aggression and prayed for peace. In view of this sign, it is possible to speculate that a large-scale peace movement is being formed directly and indirectly among the neutral countries. After further brewing, it will inevitably choose an appropriate time to launch a powerful offensive. The effectiveness of this is still difficult to predict, but all parties have not allowed the war to spread. If the international community no longer encounters unreasonable and unavoidable accidents, then it can be seen that the extent of their efforts will achieve considerable consequences. This is something that can be asserted. Third, looking beyond national borders to examine the crowd, in Japan, 245 members of the House of Representatives "personally witnessed the natural result of the correct situation in each constituency," and then broke down party prejudices and criticized their wartime prime minister. The Eastern News did not elaborate, and did not say what the "correct situation" was. However, it can be inferred from the rationale that it is by no means witnessing the excitement of the people supporting the aggression policy, but the desolation and suffering of the people due to the prolonged war and no success. In Europe, well-known figures from all walks of life in various countries have repeatedly published papers. Although the main purpose of the argument is to support their respective national policies, what can be obtained from the words is that between Britain, France, and Germany, because there has been no large-scale war and the people on both sides have not suffered severe artillery fire or made tragic sacrifices, they have not emphasized the common hatred of the enemy that they should have. In view of this sign, it can be seen that the psychology of war in Britain, France, and Germany has not been established at all, and in Japan it is very shaken. From this, we can also see the future of the war. Fourth, international justice, international order, etc., had the appearance of a lone palm difficult to clap at the beginning of China's war of resistance. Most European and American people failed to understand the pain, and only smiled at it. As the world changes became more urgent and dramatic, the value of international justice and order became more apparent. The United States possesses the power to turn the tide, and the more it is set off by various international crimes, the more its pure light shines. It has a consistent and firm national policy, but the objective evaluation has been close to ambiguity. Until recently, time has exposed the United States in a positive way. For example, the opposition party also advocates an arms embargo on Japan, which can be regarded as the dawn. The expiration of the US-Japan trade treaty on the 26th of this month can be regarded as the dawn of US national policy. The fact that the power is enough to turn the tide, and time makes it turn the tide, is the first program scheduled for 1940, which is attracting worldwide attention.

What has been stated above cannot be used as a basis for celebrating the New Year, but analyzing its trend and pursuing its consequences, there is no doubt that it is comforting!

### US to Impose Sanctions on Japan for Infringement of Interests in China, Pittman Prepares to Propose Embargo, Majority of Supporters in Congress

Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman announced last night that "at an appropriate time" he would ask the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to approve a proposal authorizing President Roosevelt to declare a ban on goods being shipped to Japan. However, he deeply hopes that the current negotiations in Tokyo will allow Congress to take no action on the embargo proposal. As to whether Congress will take action against Japan, it depends entirely on whether Japan can fulfill its promises. According to general observation, Pittman's official remarks last night showed that if Japan does not fulfill its promises, the United States will never reach an agreement with it. Pittman also said, "The reason why the Senate Foreign Relations Committee did not take immediate action on the embargo proposal in the last Congress was to wait for the abolition of the US-Japan trade treaty. As for the proposal to authorize the US President to ban goods from being shipped to Japan, I will definitely ask the committee to pass it at an appropriate time. I have not yet received a report on whether Japan has recently fulfilled its promises and stopped infringing on the rights of American citizens in China. Our government is currently negotiating with Japan, demanding that Japan stop discriminating against American citizens in China. I hope that Japan can fulfill its promises immediately so that Congress will not take action," and so on. (30th United Press report)

Washington: According to a brief survey conducted by a United Press reporter last night on various key members of Congress, during this congressional session, all members will discuss the issue of stopping trade with Japan with an open mind, sincerely, impartially, and without prejudice. This move by the United States is a kind of retaliation against Japan for infringing on the lives and interests of American citizens in the Far East. The discussion in this Congress will undoubtedly be affected by what the Japanese do in the next few weeks of the new year. Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Relations Committee have arrived in Washington to attend the congressional meeting. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman and Washington Democratic Senator Schwellenbach are the most ardent advocates of stopping trade with Japan. Isolationist leader Borah and Michigan Republican Senator Vandenberg are the most ardent advocates of continuing trade with Japan. Other senators from various states who have arrived in Washington have refused to publicly comment on this matter. According to observers, the faction supporting Pittman's proposal will have greater influence in Congress than the faction supporting Borah and Vandenberg. Republicans account for only seven seats on the Foreign Relations Committee, while Democrats account for sixteen seats. There is also an important and undecided factor, namely the opinions of the senators from the cotton-producing states. The amount of American cotton imported to Japan each year is very large. Some senators from the southern states believe that the development of the Japanese in China will allow them to obtain cotton in the Far East and reduce their purchases from the United States. The State Department has remained silent for the past few weeks and has not made any public comments. The State Department also maintained a silent attitude during the congressional session in September and October of this year, and won the final victory. Therefore, all sectors believe that the State Department is now confident and has decided to implement sanctions against Japan. (31st United Press report)

### Japanese Diet Members' Movement to Overthrow the Cabinet Becomes More Active

Tokyo: After the Japanese government adopted a method of observing the development of the situation with regard to the no-confidence movement of the representatives of the various factions in the House of Representatives, the attitudes of the meetings of the representatives of the various factions have gradually become more active, so there is a tough opinion to propose an early holding of the parliament. Therefore, the situation around the political situation is not optimistic. Secretary-General Endo visited Minister of the Army Sugiyama, Foreign Minister Nomura, and Minister of Colonial Affairs Kanemitsu on the 30th, and successively visited Prime Minister Abe's private residence in Nishiookubo, and discussed issues related to breaking the deadlock and implementing the political situation. Among them, Minister of the Army Sugiyama conveyed the intentions of the Army Ministry in detail, and frankly exchanged opinions with the Prime Minister. (31st Allied Press report)

### Soviet Union and Japan Establish Provisional Fisheries Agreement

Switzerland Jingcheng: The German semi-official agency, Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, recently issued a Moscow dispatch saying that Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov and Japanese Ambassador Tōgō Shigenori reached a provisional agreement on fisheries yesterday, extending the current agreement (until the 31st) until the official agreement comes into effect. Regarding this matter, the countries will continue to negotiate in order to conclude an official agreement as soon as possible. (31st Havas report)

### Finance Minister Kung Announces Article Expounding Wartime Finance, Expenditures Enormous After Two and a Half Years of War, Financial Institutions in No Unhealthy State

Chongqing: Executive Yuan Vice President and Finance Minister H.H. Kung today released his New Year's Day article, stating that the National Government is now implementing its wartime fiscal policy on a solid foundation, on the one hand adapting to the needs of wartime, and on the other hand laying a foundation for post-war construction. "Although the war has been extended to two and a half years, and the country's expenditures have been considerable, China's financial institutions still show no unhealthy signs, taxes have not been increased, and bonds have not been increased. All of this is not only surprising to the Japanese, but also to friendly countries who are watching with astonishment. China has been able to achieve the above successes for approximately the following six reasons: (1) a solid financial foundation was built before the war, (2) the effectiveness of various wartime facilities, (3) the bumper harvests in various agricultural areas, (4) the destruction of various cities, (5) the enthusiastic transfer of funds to the country by overseas Chinese, (6) the assistance of friendly countries. China is an agricultural country, different from industrial countries. It is not easy to suddenly demand huge sums of money to cope with the war. However, due to the stable financial policy before the war, the amount of banknotes issued was very small, so in order to meet the needs of storage, the government reissued banknotes. However, the difference from other countries is that China did not issue an order to control various banks, but only remained in a supervisory position. It is completely inaccurate to say that China is now experiencing inflation. As for tax revenue, although customs tax revenue was affected in the early stages of the war, the government did not attempt to increase other various taxes. It is common practice for Britain and the United States to increase taxes during wartime, but China has not done this. The Chinese people who live in the areas occupied by the Japanese army are all indignant at the enemy's cruelty, and also automatically pay taxes to the central government. The government has made every effort to reduce the suffering of the people since the beginning of the war, so the government not only does not increase taxes, but also slightly reduces them whenever possible. The government's third source of income is public bonds, which Germany and France have practiced during the Great War. The Chinese government also does this. Now, the wealthy people of the country are happy to buy government bonds, all because of the outstanding credit in the past. As for China's foreign exchange, there have been many changes this year, but this situation always occurs in every country that buys foreign exchange due to the existence of a black market. Furthermore, this phenomenon is particularly evident in the national speculation market in Shanghai, because Shanghai is now occupied by Japan. As for the soaring prices in the inland, it is due to the lack of transportation. The government is now making every effort to remedy this. At the end of the original article, Minister Kung did not mention Japan's wartime finances and make a comparison with China, so it can be seen that Japan's situation is far less than China's and has already surpassed the path of inflation.

### Italian Government and Vatican Prepare to Launch Peace Movement; Seek US Support to Maintain European Balance

London: Foreign policy observers here recently stated that the Italian government and the Vatican will launch a peace movement after the New Year, and will seek US support. Even if the US cannot provide material assistance, it can at least provide spiritual support. From Italy's perspective, the country deeply understands that regardless of whether Germany or Britain and France win the current war, Italy will no longer be treated as an equal, and will not be able to obtain various concessions. Therefore, for Italy's sake, maintaining the balance of these two major opposing blocs is essential. As for Germany, conservatives there also agree with this peace movement. The sudden retirement of German Aviation Minister General Göring is said to be intended to pave the way for future peace movements. Currently, there are efforts within Germany to make Britain and France feel the attitude of the conservatives and Göring faction, which is more moderate than that of other leaders of the Nazi Party. It is not difficult for Germany to make certain concessions, such as establishing a smaller Polish state and giving greater autonomy to the Czech and Slovak peoples, thereby restoring peace. Italy is said to be encouraging this activity. Therefore, Germany's military actions in the coming months will be limited to sporadic air raids and attacks on British warships and merchant ships at sea, rather than the large-scale offensives it has previously launched. This attitude contradicts the original intention of German leader Hitler. If it becomes a reality, it will prove that the conservatives have gained the upper hand, because they believe that it is better for Germany to exchange concessions for "cheap peace" in the short term than to "completely collapse."

Vatican City: The Vatican's various activities from December 1st of last year to the 15th of this month have been compiled into a book and published.

### US Secretary of State Hull's New Year's Message: Future Not Hopeless; Must Strive for Peace

Washington: US Secretary of State Hull recently issued a "New Year's Message," stating briefly that in the last few months of 1939, American public opinion was commendable for its farsightedness and calmness. Even now, although the international situation is overshadowed, there is still hope that it will not remain dark forever. The main condition is that the nations of the world should unanimously have a desire for peace. Conversely, if one of the major powers decides to use force to pursue a policy of aggression, and uses force or the threat of force to force other countries to accept its will, then other countries can only choose one of two tragic paths: either swallow their pride and declare surrender, or defend themselves by force. I believe that there are very few people in the world today who do not have their hearts intertwined with fear and hope. What they fear is that the shadow of war will continue to expand, and what they hope is that there will eventually be a day when war can be avoided. In fact, all countries in the world can achieve peace, but only if the people of the world unanimously follow the path of peace can it be achieved. According to the history of the evolution of world civilization, the forces of freedom and progress will ultimately achieve final victory. Therefore, the future is not hopeless. At this time when mankind is facing a serious crisis, this period of destruction of life and property thrown into a bottomless pit may just be beginning, but in 1940, it is not impossible for the countries of the world to draw sufficient strength from their conscience, reason, and awareness to reverse their past actions and re-establish friendly and peaceful international relations, thereby seeking the spiritual and material progress of mankind. In short, "Once peace is restored, our country, for its own benefit, must make spiritual and material efforts to establish a stable and lasting order in the world based on justice, so as to avoid future international economic contradictions, social unrest, and even military wars. I cannot help but expect it." (31st Joint Havas Dispatch)

### Edison Officially Appointed US Navy Secretary

### Balkan Countries' Diplomatic Activities: Hope for Understanding in Polish-Romanian Dispute

Sofia: Romanian Minister to Turkey Stojka, who is currently traveling from Ankara to Bucharest, passed through Sofia yesterday, made a brief stop, and met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov. The Yugoslav and Greek ministers to Bulgaria also visited Stojka. This diplomatic activity makes the rumor that Balkan countries will hold an important meeting more credible. However, officials in Bucharest deny the news that such a meeting will be held in the Yugoslav capital, and stated that after the developments of the past few weeks, Romania's position has not changed. Last night, Stojka told Bulgarian journalists that the problems between Poland and Romania could be resolved soon. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

### Turkey's Troubles Come in Pairs: Earthquake Followed by Flood; Millions of Victims Trapped in Hunger and Cold; Countries Offer Condolences and Donations

Istanbul: A new earthquake struck Turkey last night, causing traffic between Istanbul and Uzunköprü to be cut off again. As if troubles never come alone, the river channels in the Izmir and Bursa areas of Asia Minor have also flooded, and due to the speed of the water, 14 towns were submerged last night. It is estimated that the earthquake in Uzunköprü Province last week resulted in 75,000 deaths and injuries. The new earthquake was also extremely fierce, with over 30 villages and towns destroyed last night. (31st United Press Dispatch)

Ankara: After a major earthquake occurred in the Anatolian region of Turkey, the Turkish government, while frantically trying to provide disaster relief, was further troubled by the unusually cold weather and continuous heavy snow. The refugees in the disaster area, who had survived the catastrophe, could not withstand the cold and hunger, so the lives of 150,000 people were in danger of dying. The trains carrying relief supplies were blocked by heavy snow, and only a portion of the telephone and telegraph lines had been repaired.

### Hitler Declares Germany's Victory Will Be Determined in 1940; Issues Two Proclamations to Encourage Military and Civilians; Three Commanders-in-Chief Express Belief in Victory

Berlin: In addition to issuing a letter to the army, navy, and air force, Hitler wrote a long article to the Nazi Party stating that 1940 will be the year that determines German history. After recounting the various achievements he has made since taking office, Hitler stated that 1940 will produce a decision that will undoubtedly be a German victory. Even if individuals have to sacrifice now, it is by no means comparable to the fate imposed on the German people by those who created the Treaty of Versailles when they regained power. We are fighting not only against the injustice of the Treaty of Versailles, but also against the even greater injustice that will replace the Treaty of Versailles. We believe that the new era cannot be created by the corrupt world powers, and the work of transforming Europe must rely on countries and forces that can be considered young and productive. The world's Jewish capitalists cannot continue to exist in the 20th century. The first stage of the current war has shown two things: (1) the enemy does not dare to attack Germany's western border; (2) wherever German soldiers come into contact with the enemy, the reputation of German soldiers and their weapons is once again evident. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

Berlin: German leader and Supreme Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Hitler issued a proclamation to the soldiers, stating: "Soldiers, 1939 was a year of testing for the German army. You have used various weapons to fight in a war that was forced upon us, and in the short period of 18 days, you have secured Germany's eastern border and eradicated the unfair measures of the Treaty of Versailles. As this historically significant year passes, we express our gratitude to the soldiers who are loyal to the nation and the country. We pray to God to continue to bless us as He did last year, to complete our responsibilities. We are fighting for the survival of the German nation, and the entire nation has deep trust in you. With you as our soldiers, Germany will surely achieve final victory." (31st Haitong)

Berlin: German Army Commander-in-Chief General Walther von Brauchitsch issued a proclamation to the soldiers, stating: "Soldiers of the Army, the victories of the German army in the war against the enemy in 1939 in Poland and the achievements on the Western Front will be recorded in history as a clear demonstration of the German army's morale and strength. These achievements are enough to strengthen our belief in final victory. I express my gratitude to the soldiers who fought bravely, sacrificed themselves, and enhanced the honor of the German army. We greet wartime 1940 with an attitude of supporting Leader Hitler, believing in Germany's strength, understanding the war objectives, and adhering to the determination to win." (31st Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Berlin: German Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Erich Raeder issued a proclamation to the soldiers, stating: "Sailors, the German nation is fighting for the survival of Germany. The German Navy has proven that it can not only challenge the enemy, but also inflict heavy damage on the enemy. The German Navy will carry forward its traditional spirit, believe in God, obey the leader, and strive for final victory." (31st Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Berlin: General Göring issued a proclamation to the public on New Year's Day, stating: "The German people have been at war for four months. The achievements of the German army, navy, and air force have left indelible records in history. The German land in the east has been liberated, and the German army is currently fighting the enemy on the Western Front. The iron law of war determines the lives of the people, and economic life is also governed by this iron law. The rear is the source of strength for the front line. The factories in the cities and villages are all adapted to the needs of national defense. Labor and raw materials have been used in the most appropriate places. All sectors of economic life have achieved the greatest results, and the food base of the people is also stable. The material burden of wartime is distributed among the people according to the principles of social justice, so the peace-time economy has safely transformed into a wartime economy. I express my gratitude for the cooperative attitude of all parties. I know that they have all done their best to help farmers work hard in harvesting and planting. Factory managers and employers still maintain a creative spirit and a responsible attitude. Women are at ease in their housework and occupations, and all German people adhere to the belief in final victory, trust in Germany's strength, and the German people deeply understand their rights and obligations, maintain unified desires, emotions, and thoughts, and are loyal to the leader. Germany has become strong and unified because of the slogan "The leader orders, we obey." This slogan remains effective." (31st Haitong Dispatch)

Berlin: General Göring, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, issued the following notice today: "Comrades of the German Air Force, the past year can be described as the most glorious year in German history. What we did not want to happen, but what we did not fear, finally happened and became a reality. The peace policy advocated by Leader Hitler has always been unsuccessful, and we have had to resort to arms and punishment. Britain is determined to destroy, which is why this war arose. Our leader and commander, in order to defend the sacred and inviolable rights related to survival, issued the order to fight and win when the disaster of war came. In the first half of this year, Germany completed the work of liberating the Memel region and establishing the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Afterwards, in the war against Poland, we defeated the enemy and destroyed the enemy's air force in a matter of days. Not only do I admire the merits of my Air Force comrades, but the entire German people are also happy about it. The German army, navy, and air force cooperated extremely well, and were able to completely annihilate the enemy in a short period of time. Although the German-Polish campaign has ended, Germany's war has not ended. Britain and France do not want peace, as evidenced by current documents. Therefore, the heavy responsibility of prolonging the war should be borne by Britain and France. Since Britain and France want war, Germany can satisfy their desires. The German Air Force has carried out long-range expeditions, penetrated deep into enemy airspace, and carried out fierce bombings of British ships, repeatedly establishing miraculous feats. The enemy aircraft that invaded German airspace have been repeatedly defeated by the German Air Force. The bravery of our Air Force comrades and the heroic sacrifices of our martyred comrades have won the trust of the people of the country. On the occasion of the New Year, I would like to thank you all, and we all pay tribute to the martyrs. The soldiers of the German Air Force reaffirm their oath to be loyal to the leader and commander, and to fight for Germany's freedom. The entire German people, under the unity of National Socialism, will spare no sacrifice. One last word: In 1940, the slogan of the German Air Force is nothing more than the word victory. Signed by General Göring at the Air Force Headquarters on December 31, 1939." (31st Haitong Dispatch)

Amsterdam: Local newspapers report a Berlin dispatch stating that Hitler does not intend to hold a diplomatic corps reception on New Year's Day as usual, and will probably only place a book in the Führer's Office for diplomats to sign. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

### Soviet Far Eastern Army of 40,000 Deployed to Central Finland for Combat; Soviet Troops Briefly Attempted to Cross Lake Suanto; Some Finnish Troops Retreat into Norwegian Territory

Helsinki – The Soviet Far Eastern Army, 40,000 strong, under the command of General Stan, has already been deployed to the front lines of central Finland. Previously, the Soviet Far Eastern Army achieved victory in battles against Japanese forces on the "Manchuria"-"Mongolia" border. This time, they will take advantage of their remaining might to break through the Finnish Mannerheim Line. They are currently concentrating at the narrowest point of the entire Finnish island, attempting to divide Finland in two. Finnish high command announced last night that Soviet troops attempted to cross Lake Suanto yesterday morning but were repelled. The important industrial area of Tampere was bombed yesterday; the details of the damage are unknown. The Hanko Peninsula was also attacked from the air, with sixty bombs hitting the area, destroying one hospital and burning five houses, injuring ten people. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

Helsinki – The General Headquarters has just issued a battle report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet artillery was quite active. The Red Army attempted to cross Lake Suanto at dawn today and attack our positions, but they were ultimately repelled. Our troops also destroyed two Soviet tanks between the towns of Somajärvi and Muolaanjärvi. (2) On the Eastern Front, the Red Army launched an offensive in the Kitilä area, north of Lake Ladoga, but they were repelled. Furthermore, enemy and our troops engaged in day-long skirmishes yesterday between the towns of Honkasalmi and Säiskijärvi. Our troops have strengthened their existing positions. (3) Northeast of the town of Lieksa in the east, the Red Army, after retreating to the border line a few days ago, launched an offensive in the Kuumu area but were once again repelled to the border line by our troops. (4) Soviet warships were not active today. (5) Soviet aircraft were still very active today, flying to places such as Käkisalmi, Vaasa, and Järviseudun, carrying out large-scale bombings, causing many civilian casualties. As for our country's aircraft, they also conducted reconnaissance flights several times and shot down two enemy aircraft. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

Helsinki – It has been a full month since the Soviet Union invaded Finland. Military experts here have recently analyzed the state of the war, stating roughly that from Lake Ladoga in the south to the coastline of the Arctic Ocean in the north, the area remains under the control of Finnish troops. Although the Red Army has a large number of personnel and powerful weaponry, they have only managed to gain a foothold in the town of Salla, south of the port of Petsamo in the north. It has been verified that the Red Army originally planned to traverse the central part of Finland from the Soviet border, reaching the Gulf of Bothnia directly, attempting to cut Finland into two pieces, but this has completely failed. In addition, the Red Army has launched an offensive in northern Finland, but because the area is a frigid zone with ice and snow, the offensive has been quite difficult. Furthermore, Finnish troops have high morale and are full of combat power, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the invading enemy forces. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

Stockholm – According to news from the capital of Finland, the largest number of volunteers are from Italy, Spain, and various Latin American countries. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

Moscow – According to a communiqué issued by the Leningrad Military District, there were no major developments on the front lines before December 30th. (TASS dispatch, 31st)

Amsterdam – According to a report from the "Daily Mail" correspondent stationed in the Finnish capital, the Finnish Air Force currently has forty British aircraft. The correspondent continued, stating that Finland currently has 1,000 trained air force pilots, waiting for foreign aircraft to arrive before heading to the front lines to participate in the war. (Haitong dispatch, 31st)

Oslo – Sixty Finnish soldiers who crossed into Norwegian territory from Pasvikdalen yesterday have been disarmed and detained by Norwegian border guards. According to the Finnish soldiers, they were forced to cross the border to escape because they had been continuously fighting the Russian army for a day and night and had run out of ammunition and food. According to their estimates, the number of Soviet troops attacking Petsamo reaches 12,000. (Haitong dispatch, 31st)

Danzig – The local Nationalzeitung recently published a report from Riga stating that although the Soviet government recently convened an important military conference in Moscow to discuss the situation of the war against Finland, some people reportedly advocated accepting the conditions previously proposed by Finland and making peace with them. Others advocated waiting until next spring before launching an offensive again. However, the majority of people advocated launching a large-scale offensive immediately, without waiting for Finland to receive large amounts of aid from abroad. As a result, this faction's advocacy was victorious, and the war within Finland has recently become more active. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

Stockholm – The Dagens Nyheter recently published a cable from its Berlin correspondent stating that the German government has issued a statement saying that if the Scandinavian countries allow armaments to pass through their territory to Finland, Germany does not consider it a violation of neutrality. However, if Britain and France use this aid to pursue their own selfish goals, and if these countries are drawn into the sphere of influence of Britain and France, it will not be tolerated by Germany. In addition, the correspondent learned from reliable sources that the Soviet Union has not requested technical assistance from Germany in the war against Finland. Therefore, Germany may not send technicians to the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

Stockholm – The Svenska Dagbladet correspondent stationed in the Finnish capital recently reported that 20,000 Red Army soldiers were defeated by Finnish troops in the town of Suomussalmi in the Karelian region. On the other hand, Finnish troops had already invaded Soviet territory in two places in the eastern Kivivaara and Inari areas. Now, they have crossed the border line again in an area near Kuumu. The Finnish military authorities have not confirmed the news that the Murmansk railway line in the Soviet Union has been destroyed by Finnish troops, but they stated that ski troops from Finland are indeed operating behind Red Army lines in the town of Salmijärvi (in the Karelian Isthmus). In addition, four American youths recently came to Sweden together and will transfer to Finland to join the American ambulance service. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

London – According to a news report released by Radio Rome, General Stan, the former commander of the First Far Eastern Soviet Army, has now been appointed as the commander of the Soviet forces in Murmansk. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

### Wartime Financial Situation in Britain

London – Three-quarters of the British fiscal year has now passed. During this period, Britain's regular income was £944,474,000, and regular expenditure was £858,835,000. The shortfall has been made up by government borrowing approved by Parliament to meet war expenses. The amount paid by the Ministry of Supply has now reached £657,487,000. Due to the tax increases in the previous budget, this year's income has increased by £54,038,000 compared to the same period last year. However, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon will have the largest gain in the fourth quarter, as the surtax of £300,000,000 on income tax will be paid in full in the final quarter. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

London – According to reliable sources, based on figures from the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's December report, Britain has US$4,000,000,000 in deposits in the United States. At the beginning of the last Great War, Britain had between US$2,000,000,000 and US$3,000,000,000 deposited in the United States. France's deposits in the United States have increased from US$1,200,000,000 to US$3,580,000,000. And Germany's deposits in the United States have decreased from more than US$1,000,000,000 to less than US$200,000,000. One thing that cannot be forgotten is that the value of the U.S. dollar is now lower than before, and the cash-and-carry system has now been implemented. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### French Invention: Balloon Ship; Prevents Sinking from Mine Contact

London – The Sunday Chronicle reports that the Director of the French Naval Shipbuilding Bureau, Aubin-Villard (who designed the French ocean liner Normandie), has recently invented a "balloon ship." The part of the hull in the water is divided into several isolated compartments filled with high-pressure air. Even if the ship hits a mine or is hit by a torpedo, it will not sink. British shipyards are now building them in large quantities to cope with the threat of German submarines and mines. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

### German Oil Tanker to be Detained

Montevideo – The German oil tanker "Tacoma" is an auxiliary ship of the German Navy. If the ship does not leave Uruguayan territorial waters within the prescribed time, its crew and the crew of the "Graf Spee" will be detained. When the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee" scuttled itself, part of the crew was rescued by the "Tacoma". (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 31st)

### The European Situation and the Soviet Enigma

(Paris Airmail) Mr. Blum recently published an article stating that in recent weeks, the Soviet enigma has become increasingly mysterious and unfathomable. This poses a threat to Britain, France, and even the whole of Europe, like the pendulum with a sharp blade in Edgar Allan Poe's short story, suspended overhead, swinging back and forth, gradually descending, never knowing when it will stop swinging, nor where it will stop. Those beneath it are naturally uneasy. Extending this to the Soviet Union, it is difficult to speak of neutrality. Will it be able to adhere to it unswervingly in the future? Will it adopt the opposite policy when it comes to sending troops to help, and instead assist Britain and France? All of these questions have become increasingly important, but seeking a definite answer has also become increasingly difficult. When we study this issue, we are most easily blinded by preconceived notions. The attitude that the Soviet Union has taken towards German National Socialism in the past two and a half months is truly

unfathomable. The absurdity of the matter is something we cannot condone. But can Stalin really be a friend or ally of Hitler? Communism and racism are as incompatible as water and fire. Can the Soviet Union really forget about this? If Germany wins this European war, it will move its troops eastward and attack the Soviet Union. Is the Soviet Union unaware of this fact? I believe that all of these are impossible matters, and the current situation is unlikely to last. Therefore, we still have some hope for the Soviet Union, that before the end of the war, or in the next few weeks, this pendulum may shift its position and move from the heads of Britain and France to the head of Hitler. Although this hope is possible, to say that the signing of the German-Soviet pact was merely a trap set by Stalin for Hitler, that Stalin's intention was merely to lure Hitler into forming an alliance with him and to put a rope around Hitler's neck so that he could be more easily hanged in the future, is also wishful thinking. Judging from the attitude the Soviet Union has taken in the past six months, this

ambiguous, rude, unreasonable, hypocritical, and greedy attitude has prevented the continuation of the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and we cannot help but feel revulsion at its sophistry, denial of truth, and disregard for all of humanity. For example, after hearing the speech given by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the tripartite talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, we were left with a sense of bewilderment. However, we must remain impartial and maintain our composure. We must also not overemphasize the statements of the Soviet authorities. Only by adopting this kind of fair attitude can we then examine the facts. I believe that the most important fact is that if the Soviet Union truly desired peace, then war would not have broken out in Europe. This statement is almost a truth. If we think about it further, we can understand that its significance is very great. Soviet spokespersons can say that their country has peaceful intentions, and even repeatedly declare that their country is the most peace-loving country in the world. However, actions speak louder than words. In July and August of this year, Stalin held great power, like a god. The door to war was entirely at his discretion to open or close. If he had been willing to sign a tripartite treaty with Britain and France at that time, then the door to war could have been closed as a result. Hitler would not have dared to ignore it and invade Poland rashly. Conversely, if he was willing to sign a treaty with Germany, then the door to war would have been opened as a result. Germany's invasion of Poland was made easy as a result, and Hitler was thus able to relive his dream of triggering a total war to support his aggressive actions. In short, Stalin was the master of Europe's fate at that time, able to choose one of two treaties. Therefore, the door to war could also be opened or closed by him. Who knew that in the end, Stalin finally

colluded with Germany, signing a non-aggression pact with it, and the door to war was thus opened. If Stalin had truly hoped for peace, the European war would not have broken out. This fact is truly undeniable. Furthermore, the principle on which Soviet policy has been based in the past two months has been, on the one hand, to take advantage of the protracted nature of the European war to strive to seize concrete benefits through military victories in Poland, the Baltic coast, Finland, and other places, and on the other hand, to continue to maintain a neutral position towards the Allied powers of Britain and France. Up to this point, not a single Soviet plane, tank, warship, or battalion of soldiers has come into conflict with the Allied powers of Britain and France. This is clear evidence of this. Based on this, although Stalin, who held the key to peace and war at the time, was the "original author" of this European war, he himself wanted to stay out of the war so as to take advantage of the situation. This was the main characteristic of the Soviet attitude at the beginning of the European war. However, there is one point that we should pay attention to, namely, that the various actions taken by the Soviet Union in the past two and a half months have not exceeded the scope of neutrality, and have not publicly taken the behavior of a belligerent country. However, these actions have only served to facilitate Hitler, which is the actual situation. Regarding this, I can list several

facts as proof. For example: (1) When Hitler first launched a peace offensive, the Soviet Union formally endorsed it. (2) The Soviet Union again signed a commercial agreement with Germany, and provided assistance in a special way, thereby reducing the impact of the British and French blockade policies. (3) In principle, it opposed the blockade policies implemented by Britain and France (this can be seen in the Soviet Union's reply to the British memorandum). (4) It tried its best to sow discord between Turkey and Britain and France, attempting to win Turkey over to Hitler's group. (5) Molotov delivered a speech theoretically opposing the Allied powers of Britain and France continuing to wage war against Germany, while defending Hitler's aggressive actions and attempting to place the responsibility for the outbreak of this European war on Britain and France. In summary, Stalin, within the scope permitted by his neutral position, has actually done his best to help Hitler, without a doubt. If we can study all of these facts without any preconceived notions, we can reach a conclusion, namely, that Stalin and Hitler have reached a close understanding. The positions of these two giants in this European war may be different, but their goals are the same. This alone has aroused great revulsion in Britain and France. Although this revulsion seems very reasonable and of great value to us, Stalin and Hitler do not care. If we put ourselves in the position of the Soviet Union, it is not difficult to imagine that although Stalin is logically afraid of Hitler's victory, a victory for the Allied powers of Britain and France is still a crisis for the Soviet Union. Which of these two crises is Stalin most afraid of? It seems difficult to say at this time. In my opinion, the Soviet Union's so-called neutrality is

self-deception. The understanding reached between Stalin and Hitler is almost no different from an alliance treaty. Once these two dictators believe that it is beneficial to both sides, they will formally conclude a military alliance. I am not sure if there is anything wrong with my assessment. Although Stalin's attitude is ambiguous and unfathomable, it is actually very simple. All of his decisions are based on his material interests. As for the theory of world revolution advocated by the Communist Party twenty years ago, it is probably not within my so-called "material interests," because the interests that Stalin wants to seize are the interests of his personal rule, and the interests of the imperialism of the Tsarist era. However, it is also possible that Stalin's concept of these two kinds of interests will be completely changed after the current war is protracted. If so, then Stalin will treat Hitler no differently from how he treats the Allied powers of Britain and France, or even how he treats the Communist parties in European countries, and will act unscrupulously. In other words, he may again conduct dual negotiations at that time, as he did between March and August of this year, which is not necessarily the case. But as things stand now, Stalin's attitude is still very ambiguous. The reason for this is probably that Molotov is using a "policy of free action" to replace "neutrality," right? It would be unwise for the Allied powers of Britain and France to object in advance to the future changes in the Soviet Union, but it is also not a good idea to think that making concessions or flattering the Soviet Union can make it change its course.

### British Government Decides Hong Kong is Outside the Sterling Area; Singapore Restricts Imports of Hong Kong Products Accordingly; Hong Kong Manufacturers and Businesses Greatly Alarmed; Hong Kong Economic Experts Explain the Reasons for This Move

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Singapore government promulgated an ordinance in November 1939 prohibiting the import of more than 200 types of goods from non-British countries. Initially, Hong Kong manufacturers believed that since Hong Kong was a British territory and the Hong Kong dollar was supported by gold pound reserves, it should be included in the sterling area. Moreover, Hong Kong products, which used some British raw materials in accordance with regulations, enjoyed preferential tax treatment when shipped to Singapore. Therefore, they did not pay much attention to it. However, recent news has come that the Singapore government believes that the relationship between the Hong Kong dollar and the pound sterling is limited to the use of the Exchange Fund. As a result, Hong Kong has been listed as a non-sterling area, and the import ban ordinance has been applied to Hong Kong, causing great alarm among manufacturers. The Chinese Manufacturers' Association, as the leading group for manufacturers, should find ways to remedy the situation. Therefore, it sent personnel to consult with the Western Merchants' Association, and also scheduled to convene a general meeting of the industry on January 6 to discuss how to proceed. According to a statement by Mr. Yip Lan-chuen, chairman of the association, if Singapore lists Hong Kong as a non-sterling area and prohibits the import of Hong Kong goods, Hong Kong's industry and commerce will suffer a very serious blow. The Western merchants have paid close attention to this matter, and some import merchants have appealed to the Western Merchants' Association, which will soon petition the government for assistance. As for the Chinese Manufacturers' Association, it is more concerned about this matter than the Western merchants. The first step is to investigate the annual trade situation between all Hong Kong manufacturers and Singapore. When the investigation is completed, it can be submitted to the government. I personally visited Mr. Noel Croucher, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, on December 22 to discuss this matter in my private capacity. Mr. Croucher expressed great concern about this matter, and it is also a very proper way for merchants to petition the authorities. I will always do my best to help. However, this matter falls within the scope of the Colonial Secretary, and in the future, my petition will be forwarded to the Colonial Secretary by the Secretary for Chinese Affairs. As for the issue of Hong Kong being a non-sterling area, this was decided by the British government. As far as I know, although Canada is a British territory, it is also a non-sterling area. However, the reasons for our association's request in the future will not be limited to this point, because most of Hong Kong's products use British raw materials, and Hong Kong is a British territory, and Hong Kong's prosperity is also Britain's prosperity. Mr. Yip continued, saying that after the prohibition of Hong Kong goods is implemented, not only will Hong Kong manufacturers be affected, but Singapore's prosperity will also inevitably be affected. In recent years, the sale of Hong Kong goods in Singapore has been as vigorous as bamboo shoots after rain. The reason is that Hong Kong's labor costs are low, the cost of goods is low, and there is preferential tax treatment for shipping to Singapore. If Singapore prohibits the import of Hong Kong goods in the future, the Singapore market will naturally be replaced by British goods. It goes without saying whether the high price of British goods in today's war situation can be sold to the people of Malaya with weak purchasing power.

According to an economic expert who previously served on the Hong Kong Economic Committee and is currently a member of the Tax Commission, the British government's decision to list Hong Kong as a non-sterling country and treat the Hong Kong dollar as foreign currency is aimed at consolidating the British Empire's wartime financial and economic institutions. Originally, the monetary system adopted by Hong Kong was no different from that of Singapore. However, since Britain declared war on Germany, it has promulgated the National Defense Financial and Economic Ordinance. After Singapore implemented it, it restricted the purchase of foreign exchange, which was quite effective. However, Hong Kong is close to China's ports, and its currency circulates in the southern part of China. The situation is special, and the implementation of this ordinance is inevitably relaxed. For example, although the purchase of US dollars in Hong Kong is restricted, people can purchase Chinese legal tender and use it to purchase US dollars in Shanghai. In this way, it is inevitably affected. The British government's new ordinance listing Hong Kong as a non-sterling area will affect remittances from overseas Chinese in various British territories in the future.

### Shantou Puppet Organization Establishes Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau; Purpose is to Absorb Remittances from Overseas Chinese

Shantou Correspondence. The Japanese Southern Advance Plan, targeting the Chaozhou-Shantou and Zhangzhou-Xiamen area, where many people have gone abroad and hold the most influence in overseas Chinese societies in Southeast Asia. To implement the southern advance policy, it is necessary to first curry favor with the overseas Chinese. Therefore, the Japanese army is particularly implementing a pacification strategy in Chaozhou-Shantou. The puppet Shantou Local United Association, after being renamed the puppet Post-War Committee, appointed Zhou Zhizhen as the puppet director and organized three puppet bureaus: General Affairs, Finance, and Police Affairs. Shu Ji Nan was appointed as the puppet Director of General Affairs, Xiao Xiling as the puppet Director of Finance, and Shen Rongguang as the puppet Director of Police Affairs. Now, they plan to establish a puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau specifically to investigate the family situations of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, forcing them to write letters to compel overseas Chinese abroad to submit and obey. It has been learned that the president of the Bank of Taiwan, Mizusawa Yakichi, went to Guangzhou in early December to inspect the economy and finance. After leaving Guangzhou, he went to Shantou and Xiamen to inspect. It is said that he plans to implement control over remittances from overseas Chinese. There were originally more than 40 Yin-Xin [overseas Chinese remittance] shops in Shantou City specializing in overseas Chinese business. In August, the Shantou branch of the Bank of Taiwan was already under strict supervision, allowing various Yin-Xin shops to send silver letters to their hometowns to support the families of overseas Chinese. Therefore, the Yin-Xin shops that have resumed business include Wanxingchang, Hong ..., Tongzhuang, Liyuan, Yongan, Guangshunli, ..., Yiyi, Xufucheng, Guangyiyu, Hengji, Youxin, Maochang, and twelve others. It is said that the total remittances into the various shops in November and December amounted to 750,000 yuan. When the batch of letters sent from other ports by various batch [remittance] agencies are taken out of the original package, they must be registered one by one, with the intention that the various Yin-Xin shops receive them. Therefore, the addresses of overseas Chinese living abroad are mostly filled into the registers by the Japanese. It is said that the Japanese have newly established two methods, which will be implemented from January of the 29th year of the Republic [1940]: (A) When various batch agencies collect batch letters from the post office, if the total amount is 20,000 yuan, they must pay 20,000 yuan in national currency to the Bank of Taiwan to exchange for Japanese military scrip, which will be issued to the families of the overseas Chinese; (B) When various batch agencies receive silver letters from overseas Chinese at their affiliated shops in other ports, if they send them to Japanese banks in other ports for remittance, the Bank of Taiwan in Shantou can pay the batch agencies the equivalent amount in national currency to be issued to the families of overseas Chinese. The above methods are temporarily chosen by the various merchants themselves. It is also said that Kinkura Yoshino of the Taiwan Development Company has also sent his company employee Saburo Sugiyama to Chaozhou-Shantou to persuade Xu Xueyou, Zhu Shaoyan, Lin Yousong, and others from the Chaoan Chamber of Commerce to invite various batch agencies and Yin-Xin shops to organize an overseas Chinese bank, with capital equally shared between China and Japan, and managed by Taiwanese. The purpose is to absorb foreign exchange to purchase military supplies and promote the sale of Japanese military scrip without a reserve fund in order to destroy Chinese legal tender, or to take coercive measures to prohibit the circulation of legal tender in the market. Yoshino also sent his wife, Tokiko, to Shantou and Xiamen to lead women's groups and visit the families of overseas Chinese in the countryside. Therefore, the establishment of the puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau is driven by the Taiwan Development Company behind the scenes.

### Western Police Fight with Eight Men; Defeated by Donghua; Three to Zero, Donghua Declares Victory; Western Police Morale is Even Lower

The Donghua soccer team's lineup has been declining recently. Luo Doujiao has returned to Hong Kong, and Cai Shengmiao has been banned from playing. Dai Linjing, Zhuang Youren, and Jia Youliang were all absent yesterday due to bank closing accounts. Therefore, there were only two or three hundred spectators at Yiyuan for yesterday's Group A match against the Western Police. Unexpectedly, the Western Police, who had lost all eight previous matches, were even more demoralized yesterday. Only eight players appeared at the beginning yesterday. Therefore, in the face of a huge disparity in numbers, Wan Jinlu and Fang Hongguang succeeded with three arrows, securing the victory within sixteen minutes. Although the Western Police quickly brought in Willie Walter to guard the goal, it was of no avail. Later, Smith and Crook rushed to join the battle, but they failed to make an impact. The first half ended with a score of three to zero. After changing sides, things remained the same. Donghua ultimately secured the final victory with the initial three arrows.

### Celebrating the Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China; Shanghai Citizens Support National Policy; Municipal Party Headquarters Issues Proclamation to Console the People; Honesty and Shame Movement to be Expanded Today

Today is New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China, which is also the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. In addition to uniformly raising flags to express enthusiastic celebrations, all government agencies, public organizations, schools, and banks and money shops in the city will take a holiday as usual. All sectors believe that the founding of the Republic of China was the result of the martyrs' dedication to the revolution and their efforts to struggle. At this time of national crisis, we should unanimously support national policy, strengthen our beliefs, and promote the foundation of the martyrs' legacy. We should also take the auspicious occasion of the New Year, examine our actions and words, and deeply reflect on whether we have let down the martyrs and failed the nation and the people. This year's New Year's Day, all provinces and cities across the country are unanimously promoting the frugality and savings movement, concentrating financial resources to meet the needs of national construction. All sectors in the city are also unanimously promoting this movement, and transferring the savings to help the disaster victims.

Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters Issues a Proclamation to the People

The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters issued a proclamation to the citizens on New Year's Day of the 29th year, extending condolences to all citizens. The main points of the content are: (1) After more than two years of resistance, Japan is facing a dead end in military, internal affairs, and diplomacy, and is entering the path of collapse. (2) The proclamation thoroughly exposes and severely condemns the traitors who sell the country for personal gain, sacrifice the people, undermine the resistance, and seek humiliating peace. (3) The proclamation expresses deep gratitude to friendly countries for their sympathy and assistance. (4) The proclamation calls on citizens to persevere in the established national policy, regardless of any sacrifice: "If aggression does not stop, resistance will not stop," so as to achieve final victory and lay the foundation for genuine and lasting peace in East Asia and the world.

Honesty and Shame Movement to be Expanded

The Honesty and Shame Movement Committee, in celebration of New Year's Day, issued a proclamation to the citizens of Shanghai, recounting the founding of the Republic of China. It stated that because the national revolution has not yet succeeded, the Three People's Principles cannot be fully implemented, and because the Di people [barbarians] are insatiable in their aggression, the Chinese people have no choice but to unite and resist, defend against humiliation, and save the country. The proclamation vividly elaborated on these ideas. Finally, it encouraged the citizens of the isolated island [Shanghai] to unanimously promote the Honesty and Shame Movement, "reduce food and clothing, uphold integrity and practice frugality, strive for strength and be determined, and avenge humiliation." The proclamation was more than a thousand words long, with solemn language and righteous meaning, and it was truly thought-provoking.

Occupational Unions Issue Proclamation

The Joint Federation of Occupational Unions in the city issued a New Year's proclamation to all compatriots, saying, "Dear compatriots, today is New Year's Day of the 29th year. In addition to congratulating everyone's health, we must also congratulate you on your efforts to obtain a bright future. Now, although nominally it is the New Year with new door gods, our surroundings are full of shadows and there is no light. Our eyes are full of sores and phlegm, and thorns are everywhere. What assaults our eardrums are the cries of hunger. If we recall the scene three years ago, it is unbearable to look back. May I ask who created this difficult, embarrassing, deformed, and disordered social form? If the Japanese warlords did not invade our peaceful Chinese land, undoubtedly, we would not have such unprecedented encounters. (Omitted) Our peace is inseparable from resistance. We resist for the sake of peace. Three years of resistance have not only consolidated our national foundation, but have also revealed the phenomenon of the collapse of the Japanese national foundation. This is not empty talk. If you pay attention to the news reports every day, you will know. Resistance has now reached the third New Year. The results suggest that we are victorious. From now on, we must further consolidate our determination to resist. We must obtain freedom and equal peace from victory. From today on, for the sake of our own nation, for the sake of our own survival, we must complete the national revolution under the creed of resistance and national construction, and achieve the goal of freedom and equality."

All-Shanghai Church New Year Celebration

All the churches in Shanghai, in order to celebrate the New Year and for the sake of fellowship, are scheduled to hold a New Year's celebration at Moore Memorial Church on Chaqing Road, starting at 3:00 PM this afternoon. At that time, pastors and church members from all over Shanghai will participate. In addition to the usual programs such as music, hymns, etc., the conference will also invite Pastor Du Lihua, Dr. Wang Wanbai, and Pastor Tang Renxi, who previously attended the World Moral Rearmament Movement Conference in the United States, to speak on moral rearmament issues. There will definitely be a grand occasion.

New Year's One Yuan Disaster Relief Movement

The Shanghai Refugee Citizen Group Solicitation Committee, in order to thank all sectors for their support and promote the "New Year's One Yuan Disaster Relief Movement," issued a public notice, saying, "Time flies, and it is again New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China. Looking back on the first anniversary of the establishment of this committee, we have deeply appreciated the kindness and generous support of kind people from all walks of life. At the beginning of this year, we respectfully express our gratitude on behalf of all the refugees. We hope you will consider that this committee's 'New Year's One Yuan Disaster Relief Movement' aims to invite all sectors to save on New Year's entertainment expenses and transfer the savings to help the refugees, in order to accumulate sand into a tower and benefit the disaster victims. Those with extra strength are encouraged to donate several yuan, and even a few people combining to donate one yuan is welcome. We hope that you will consider the suffering of the refugees and actively participate, which would be greatly appreciated. The collection office is at Room 414, Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road, or you can call 18533 to notify us."

### American Consul General Gauss and His Wife Return to Shanghai Today

Important Mission During Their Stay in the Philippines; Have a Decisive Role on Far East Issues

American Consul General to Shanghai, Gauss, accompanied by Admiral Hart, took the flagship USS Augusta to Manila on November 21st of last year. Although the US Consulate stated that Gauss was going to the Philippines for a vacation and to meet his wife and eldest son, Charles, who arrived in the Philippines from San Francisco on the clipper ship, it is certain that Gauss had a mission. On December 2nd of last year, Gauss, Admiral Hart, and High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, held a special meeting in Baguio, lasting about three hours. They discussed general issues in the Far East and strengthened the US fleet in the Far East. The US's relationship with the Dutch East Indies and the US-Japan relationship were the focus of the important meeting. Among them, the decisive circumstances of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which will be abolished on January 26th of this year, were the main topic of the meeting. According to US officials, the meeting of the three giants in Manila at least indicated that the US has broad interests in the Far East, and these interests have been directly affected by the disturbances caused by the war situation. They also pointed out that Manila is the center of US interests in the Far East, including extensive military equipment. It is understood that the meeting between Gauss and Sayre and Admiral Hart in the Philippines was the first meeting after they took office.

All parties attach importance to Gauss's meeting in the Philippines. Gauss took the President Pierce, a ship, from Manila to the Far East on December 27th of last year. Before leaving, Commissioner Sayre and Philippine President Quezon hosted banquets to see him off. Gauss and his family set off and are scheduled to arrive here at 5:20 PM today. The President Pierce will berth at Pontoon 12 and 13. After spending the New Year, Gauss will return to work after his leave. Acting Consul Lockhart is scheduled to return to Ping in early this month.

### British Ambassador Departed for Chongqing Yesterday: Extra Security Increased Temporarily Along the Bund; British Consul General and Others Went to the Ship to See Him Off

Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, accompanied by the First Secretary, Mr. Broadmead, departed from his official residence on Tunsin Road at 9:00 AM yesterday, traveling in two cars directly to the Customs Wharf. They boarded a small British Steamship Company launch, which then transferred them to the "Mackendrew" steamer. The Ambassador shook hands with those seeing him off at the pier, bidding them farewell.

Before 9:00 AM yesterday, the Police Department temporarily increased the number of police officers patrolling along Nanjing Road and the Bund. The Xifuzi Highland Team and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were also ordered to be on alert at the Customs Wharf. Sir Herbert Phillips, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Sir George, and senior members of the Embassy all went to the wharf to see him off. The British Company's "Mackendrew" was berthed at the No. 11 and 12 pontoons in Yangshupu and set sail at 10:30 AM, leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong. It is reported that the ship is expected to arrive in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning this week. After arriving in Hong Kong, the Ambassador will

Fly to Chongqing by CNAC plane to meet with the central government authorities. It is estimated that the Ambassador will arrive in Chongqing on the 3rd of this month. According to sources in London, the Ambassador's trip to Chongqing is aimed at resolving the Tianjin issue between Britain and Japan, as well as the silver issue at various ports in North China. It is hoped that the eight-month-long dispute between Britain and Japan can be eased. The Ambassador will report to the Chinese government and perhaps discuss the matter. The Ambassador will stay in Chongqing for one month, while the First Secretary may be stationed in Chongqing for an extended period to facilitate communication with the National Government at any time. The British Ambassador will also raise other financial and economic issues for discussion. The general public attaches great importance to the Ambassador's trip to Chongqing, as it concerns Sino-British relations.

### 20,000 Bags of Foreign Rice to Be Sold at Government-Controlled Prices; Agreement Reached; Purchased from Shanghai Market; Flat-Price Method Not Yet Determined

In order to regulate the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai, the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association has purchased 500 tons (approximately 5,000 bags) of No. 2 Saigon rice and 1,500 tons (approximately 15,000 bags) of Saigon broken rice from the Shanghai market, totaling 20,000 bags, for flat-price sales. The association has entrusted Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, Wang Tianchou, Zhang Lizhong, and other four people from the rice industry to negotiate with various grain shops, and the prices are set at 35.83 yuan per bag for Saigon broken rice and 43.8 yuan per bag for No. 2 Saigon rice. As for the flat-price method, it is yet to be determined by the association.

Association to Discuss the Use of Funds. The People's Food Regulation Association invited representatives from various industries that have subscribed to the fund to a meeting at the Bank Club at 3:30 PM yesterday to discuss the use and distribution of the fund. Those present included Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yuqing, Zhang Nianxuan, Zheng Zenan, Chen Ziyi, Ma Shaoquan, Li Wenjie, and others. After Yu Qiaqing, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting, he gathered opinions from various industries for careful discussion. It was decided on the spot to invite representatives from various industries to continue the meeting on January 3 (Wednesday). The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.

New Year Holiday. The People's Food Regulation Association started accepting registrations for ordering foreign rice on December 27. So far, 170 families have applied for registration, and those who have paid to the Trust Department of the Jin Cheng Bank have deposited more than 100,000 yuan in national currency. As soon as a substantial amount has been accumulated, the Procurement Committee will cable overseas to order the rice for shipment to Shanghai to provide relief. Yesterday was the regular weekly holiday, and the 1st to 3rd are New Year holidays. The bank is closed. The association has temporarily suspended registration for four days because the receiving agency is closed. It has been decided to resume normal registration procedures from the 4th. In addition, the rice market will be closed for the New Year holiday for two days starting today and will resume normal trading on the 3rd.

### Japanese-Puppet Regime's Control of Vegetables Unlikely to Succeed

Local Goods Merchants Express Disapproval

According to a local goods merchant in this city yesterday, in order to manipulate the source of vegetables in the Public Concession and the French Concession, the Japanese have recently seized dozens of acres of private land behind the Sihang Warehouse and the Continental Bank Warehouse at the eastern end of Guangfu Road in Zhabei to build a unified vegetable market. In addition to repairing the bombed walls and roofs of the Sihang Warehouse, they are currently rushing to build two rows of corridors, which are expected to be completed in January or February. Judging from the situation, their plan is to monopolize not only vegetables from Pudong, West Shanghai, and Zhabei, but also fresh fruits and northern goods, such as preserved meats, eggs, etc., are also included in their control. They are now trying to attract local goods merchants to register and pay deposit money, hoping to start business in February or March. However, most of the local goods merchants are well aware of the righteousness and will not be deceived. Even if they cannot operate in the concession areas such as Laozha, Qiaoxin Zhaqiao in the future, they will have to change their business. In any case, they will not comply.

### Soviet Consulate in Shanghai Reportedly to Reopen; Sixty Soviet Diplomatic Personnel Have Set Off from Vladivostok for Shanghai

According to the Continental News, reliable sources stated last night (30th) that the staff of the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai, who suddenly left Shanghai in mid-October without issuing a notice or explanation, will return here next week. This statement has not been officially confirmed. It is noted that when the Soviet diplomats in Shanghai left in October, they entrusted the affairs of the consulate to the Norwegian Consulate to handle, leaving only a low-level

A diplomatic representative in the Norwegian Consulate. The Norwegian Consulate could not deny the saying that Soviet diplomats would return to Shanghai, but said that it had not been verified at all. Reliable sources also said that about 60 Soviet diplomats have set off from Vladivostok and are heading to Shanghai. It is expected that they will arrive here soon. It is not known whether these people will be stationed in Shanghai. According to

The resignation of Soviet consular staff in October was a mystery, causing rumors to spread. Some people believe that their departure to return home when the Soviet-Japanese announced the ceasefire in Nomonhan was a prelude to the Soviet-Japanese alliance at the expense of China. However, this evening, Chongqing ridiculed it. At the same time, other people said that this was the Soviet Union's

Friendly gesture, because China does not want the Soviet Union to maintain a consulate in the occupied area. According to the information obtained last night, the Soviet diplomats who are heading to Shanghai are all coming to China for the first time, and none of them are the ones who left in October.

### Southbound Sales of National Goods; Agreed on Methods

Improve Packaging, Negotiate Joint Transportation

Various national goods organizations in this city provide convenient certifications for national goods factories to transport goods for export and inland sales, in order to facilitate the expansion and development of national goods. However, since the Malayan colonial government promulgated foreign exchange controls, the southbound sales of national goods have suffered great obstacles. After repeated appeals from the national goods inspection representatives abroad, improvements have been made in: (1) increasing the foreign exchange control quota from 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan, (2) allowing transfer payments, such as when A buys from B, C can directly pay B, without going through A's hands, to save trouble, (3) if there is no bank in rural small ports to pay for the goods, the shipping company's certificate can also be effective. The above three methods have been approved by the British government. The national goods organizations in this city held a joint meeting a few days ago to discuss ways to actively promote the southbound sales of national goods. It is reported that it has been decided to: (1) continue to urge national goods factories to ship a large number of goods to the Nanyang territories for sales, (2) do their best to improve packaging to avoid moisture during transportation, (3) negotiate to handle joint transportation of national goods to transport a large number of goods to the mainland. The various groups have already handled them separately.

### Japanese Return of Northern District: Bureau's Attitude

According to the North China Daily News, when a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy answered questions from reporters yesterday (30th), he said that the issue of jurisdiction over the roads built by the Public Concession beyond the western district has been resolved, and the area north of the Suzhou River occupied by the Japanese army will be returned to the Shanghai Municipal Council. When the reporter inquired with a spokesman for the Municipal Council, the reply was that the Municipal Council was very satisfied to see the return of the area north of the Suzhou River. The negotiations between the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" are progressing smoothly. The bureau hopes that these negotiations will be successfully concluded.

### Britons Residing Outside the Boundaries Not to Pay Taxes to Puppet Government; British Consulate Notified British Nationals to Comply; Awaiting Results of Negotiations by the Municipal Council to Determine

According to the Continental News, Sir Herbert Phillips, the British Consul-General, stated yesterday (30th) that the British Consulate authorities have notified British residents on roads built beyond the boundary of the Public Concession to temporarily not pay taxes to the "Municipal Government". It is heard that the basis for this notice is that the tax issue on roads built beyond the boundary is still a pending issue in the negotiations between the Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government". Until it is agreed that the puppet authorities have the right to collect taxes, the puppet authorities have no right to do so. Because puppet tax collectors tried to collect taxes from several British residents on roads built beyond the boundary, the British expatriates asked the British Consulate authorities to make a decision. The British authorities then issued the above notice.

### Workers in the City's Woodworking Industry Demand Improved Treatment

Employers Express Sympathy

More than 4,000 workers in the woodworking industry in Shanghai recently felt that the cost of living has risen sharply, and even the minimum living standards are difficult to maintain. Therefore, yesterday, the workers in the industry sent nine representatives to meet with the heads of the Shanghai Woodworking Office to request a wage increase. The original letter said, "Respected sirs, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, prices have soared, rice is as expensive as pearls, firewood is as expensive as cassia, and the cost of living has increased. The original wages earned cannot support the family. Now, the workers in various industries have increased their wages one after another, but our industry has not yet implemented it. Workers are forced by livelihood to elect representatives to express their grievances in a letter. We implore you to plead with the employers to have compassion on the suffering of the workers and increase the original wages (regardless of grade) by 30% across the board and implement it quickly." It is heard that the heads of the office, Pan Ahai, Zhu Caigen, Xu Shuzhou, etc., expressed great sympathy and agreed to increase the original wages (regardless of grade) by 30% across the board starting from the 16th of this month. The representatives returned satisfied.

### Isolated Army Commander Xie's Letter to the Youth of the Isolated Island

1. Recognize the Times and Strive to Train, 2. Do Not Fall into a Decadent Life, 3. Strengthen Self-Confidence and Do Not Be Tempted

Xie Jinyuan, the commander of the Isolated Army Camp, published a letter to the youth of the isolated island during the Anti-Japanese War yesterday, saying, "New Year's Day in 1940 is the third New Year's Day since I and all my comrades were ordered to withdraw from the Four Banks Warehouse. It is also the third New Year's Day that the sacred anti-Japanese war of the motherland has experienced for two and a half years. Looking around at the changing international situation, the Second World War, which people were terrified of in the past, has finally unfolded a few months ago. And our protracted war of resistance is moving towards the smooth road to the final victory we expected. I am in the isolated island, and my heart cares about our youth and pays attention to the revival of the motherland, which is also deeply concerned. On this New Year's Day, I would like to sincerely tell the youth of the isolated island. The millions of youth in the isolated island should recognize the era we are in today as the most arduous, unprecedented, and great era in history. The youth in this great era must recognize that it is an excellent opportunity to train themselves, enrich themselves, and dedicate themselves to the country.

The Importance of Shanghai's Status During the Anti-Japanese War. Since the National Army moved west, the aspiring youth in Shanghai have rushed to the mainland to serve the country. At the same time, there are still countless young people living on the isolated island. Because of the importance of Shanghai's position and the large population, even though it is surrounded by wolves and dogs, it is still an important position in the Anti-Japanese War. Today's comprehensive anti-Japanese war has no distinction between the front and the rear. Therefore, the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, still remotely cares about the compatriots in Shanghai at all times. Therefore, the youth on the isolated island must not abandon themselves because they are in adversity and forget their mission to the country and the people. We must understand that the anti-construction must go through a difficult process, and it will increase with time. Today's isolated island is in a surrounding area full of evil atmosphere. Our youth should be more persevering and more fortitude. Under the principle of national supremacy and national supremacy, we must unite our will, take a unified step, move forward bravely, and strive for the arrival of the light.

An Excellent Opportunity to Serve the Country. It must be known that a very sacred work must be achieved in very difficult and dangerous situations. Therefore, the youth on the isolated island should think of serving the country, regardless of time and space, and devote themselves to the Anti-Japanese War. There is no concept of the size, importance, or weight of work. We must strive to grasp the reality, recognize the environment, and do our best to fulfill our national duties in our own positions. We must do one thing with one point of strength and establish a firm and unyielding belief. Today's youth are no longer in an era of high-level theories and slogans. We must strive to be down-to-earth, work hard, and strive to enrich ourselves and train our bodies to build a healthy national soul for the new China. This is what Jinyuan sincerely tells you one thing.

Encourage Each Other and Discipline the Body and Mind. At present, wolves and dogs are all over the isolated island, and the morbid material prosperity of reflection has reached its peak. Dance halls, song platforms, and dens of prostitution, gambling, tobacco, and alcohol are densely distributed on the isolated island. Some pure and weak-willed youths are tempted by them and fall into a chronic suicide hell without realizing it. The youth of the isolated island, this wine, red lights, and green venues, which tempt people to get drunk, are disguised execution grounds that put us to death. Our youth should have the ambition to establish themselves and help others, encourage each other, and never fall into a decadent life and be eliminated by the times. We must strive to be strict and self-disciplined. Thinking about the millions of soldiers and civilians in the front and rear, at this time, they are struggling harder and more resolutely for the freedom and independence of our descendants and the nation, throwing their heads and spilling fresh blood to fight to the death. How can the youth of the isolated island bear to harm themselves and be complacent? This is what Jinyuan sincerely tells you two things.

Life and Death Are Trivial Matters, Personality is Important. At present, there are indeed many people on the isolated island who have forgotten their ancestors and country, are helping the evildoers, are being used by others, and even speculate and disregard national disasters, manipulate people's food, monopolize the black market, and seek huge profits for themselves, willing to be the second Jew. All kinds of bad situations are endless. These people have become walking corpses and have cut themselves off from the Chinese people. The youth on the isolated island should have the ambition to be sober when others are turbid, and to think that life and death are trivial matters and that personality is important. Although the hearts of a small number of people are dead, the hearts of the youth on the isolated island and countless compatriots are not dead. We should strengthen our self-confidence, fight to the end, and not yield in the slightest to achieve the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country. This is what Jinyuan sincerely tells you three things. At the beginning of the New Year, I would like to encourage the youth and compatriots on the isolated island together.

### Embezzling Other People's Remittances; She Shuyun Was Detained; Total Amount is 14,000 Yuan; She Denies and the Trial Was Postponed

She Shuyun, a native of Anhui, who runs the Jiren Hospital at No. 87 Race Course Road, claims to be a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, but the Public Concession police authorities deny that he is a qualified doctor. When She was previously sued by the police for fraud to the First Special District Court at the beginning of winter, the profession section of the case file stated that Yu was an unqualified doctor. Later, the court investigated the case and found it to be true, and sentenced She Shuyun to a fine of 200 yuan. Unexpectedly,

Not long after being fined, Hu Yuzhong reported him to the Chengdu Road Police Station for embezzling 14,000 yuan of legal tender deposited, and the detectives were dispatched to arrest She at the Jiren Hospital on December 29. The reason is that Hu Yuzhong is now working at the Chongqing China Industrial Bank. He had a large amount of cash remitted to Shanghai. Because the National Government had clearly prohibited a large amount of legal tender from flowing into the occupied area, he and a colleague named Lv Dade came up with a solution. Lv's sister is She's wife, so Lv asked Hu to remit the money to Shanghai in batches and hand it over to She.

Entrusted with safekeeping. Hu remitted 14,000 yuan of legal tender from Yuanling, Hunan, to She on March 20 and April 6, asking him to transfer it to a certain bank. Unexpectedly, after receiving the money, She embezzled it all. Recently, the incident was discovered, and Hu negotiated with the introducer Lv Dade in Chongqing. It is heard that Lv has already set off from Chongqing and is heading to China to reason with Yu. He will arrive in Shanghai soon. On the one hand, Hu transferred to the manager of China Industrial Bank, Liu Ziyu, and reported the arrest nearby. So She was

Arrested again. On the morning of the 30th, the Chinese and Western detectives who handled the case escorted him to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special Court. Presiding Judge Fang Qinghuan recognized Yu because he was a recidivist. He immediately asked whether the fine for the fraud committed last month had been paid. Then, according to Yu's confession, he had complied with the judgment and paid the fine. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu began to state the circumstances of the case in which the plaintiff Hu Yuzhong remitted a large amount of money from Hunan, and presented two wooden name chops found at the defendant's residence, and other relevant evidence,

For verification. Liu Ziyu testified to the various facts that Hu remitted money to She. After being questioned by the court, although he admitted that he received 14,000 yuan, he denied that the money was deposited by Hu. He claimed that the money was his wife's property. His wife lived in Wuhu, and his brother-in-law Lv Dade originally worked for China Industrial in Wuhu. When the area was occupied, his wife gave the money to Lv to take to Chongqing, and now Lv remitted it back. Moreover, he did not know Hu at all. If Hu had money to remit to Shanghai, why not have the bank do it on his behalf, etc. Judge Fang asked if Lv had sent a letter as proof of the remittance. Yu initially claimed that he had a letter as proof, and then said that the letter had been lost. His tone was very ambiguous. Therefore, his defense lawyer requested that the defendant be allowed to post bail and wait for trial outside. The court rejected the request and ordered the trial to be postponed to January 8. She Shuyun was still taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station for detention by the detectives in the prisoner car.

### Jiangzhe Fellow Villagers Gathering

### Fraud Convict Escaped After Being Transferred; First Special Court Ordered Arrest and Return to Justice

Wang Xiang, a native of Hunan, is 33 years old. He usually specializes in using clever tricks to defraud valuable ornaments from various jewelry stores. On July 23 of this year, Wang selected two white full diamond rings and one gold diamond ring worth 1,250 yuan from a certain jewelry store at No. 308 Yuyuan Road. Wang handed over a package of banknotes at that time. After the store employee checked the amount and found it to be correct, Wang suddenly said that he did not want to buy them. The store employee took back the jewelry and returned the banknotes. Unexpectedly, Wang immediately wanted to buy them again and handed over the same package of banknotes in its original form, taking the items and leaving. However, in this quick change of hands, Wang had used tricks to replace the real banknotes with waste paper. When the store employee discovered it, he had already flown away and disappeared. He reported the information to the police station and asked them to arrest him. On November 26, Wang used the same trick again to defraud a diamond ring worth 350 yuan from the Ceylon Jewelry Store at No. 294 Jing'an Temple Road. The money he paid was 15 yuan in legal tender, and the rest was counterfeit money. Because Wang's whereabouts were secretive, it was impossible to arrest him. It was not until December 8 that Wang was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for committing a fraud case in the French Concession. After the trial, Wang Xiang was sentenced to eight years in prison. This matter was known to Ding Huaguo, the head of the Chinese detectives, and Sun Guihua, the detective, of the Xinzha Police Station. Because Wang had committed many cases in the Public Concession, he went to the French Police Station on the 27th and transferred Wang Xiang to the Xinzha Police Station. Unexpectedly, while they were investigating, Wang suddenly took the opportunity to escape without a trace. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the situation, and Judge Xiao Peishen of the First Special Court ordered that the trial should be suspended because the defendant's whereabouts were unknown, and approved the arrest for investigation.

### Large Amount of Opium Seized at Jinliyuan Wharf: Supplementary Notes

On the 29th of this month, at about 1:00 AM, a large amount of opium, totaling more than 160 catties, was seized at the Jinliyuan Wharf on Taiwan Road in the French Concession. This batch of opium was unloaded from the Taisheng ship and was seized by Chinese constables No. 85 and No. 239 of the French Police Station, as well as one Russian constable and one Vietnamese constable. The police authorities attached great importance to this case and are strictly investigating the main culprits and all accomplices in the case. However, the reports in the newspapers the day before yesterday that two Chinese constables and one Russian constable were involved in the case and had been detained by the French Police Station are not consistent with the facts.

### Lawsuit Regarding Leased Steamer: Tongsheng Company Accused of Breach of Contract; One Defendant Claims to Have Withdrawn from Partnership

Former shareholder and manager of Tongsheng Steamship Company, Hui Bingsen, around March of this year, subleased a Norwegian merchant ship, the "Landi," from Taichangxiang Steamship Company at No. 6 Jiqing Lane, Sanyangjing Bridge, at a monthly rent of 887 pounds and 10 shillings, for a term of twelve months starting from the date of delivery. After the lease agreement was signed, Taichangxiang delivered the ship. However, not long after, Tongsheng Company, claiming it had suffered significant losses, requested to terminate the lease. Taichangxiang, believing the company had breached the lease, appointed lawyer Han Jinhua, the legal representative of the company, and lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Civil Division against twelve shareholders of Tongsheng Company: Zeng Bingsen, Hui Pingyi, Huang Ru, Dai Wenlin, Chen Shaoji, Yao Rongwen, Hui Nianci, Liu Nianhua, Zeng Jizhi, Chen Xiaozeng, Liu Zirong, and Yao Shumin, alleging breach of the ship lease agreement and seeking damages totaling 940 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence, plus 75,365.01 yuan in national currency. The case was once heard by Judge Chen Can. Due to the whereabouts of defendant Chen Shaoji being unknown, the plaintiff's lawyer requested service by public notice. The hearing continued the other day. Only defendant Chen Shaoji, represented by lawyer Zhang Danping, appeared and argued that when Tongsheng Company was initially established, founder Zeng Bingsen invited defendant Chen Shaoji to join, and it was a limited liability company. Later, without approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, the company was transformed into a partnership. Defendant Chen Shaoji, in accordance with the law, then proposed his withdrawal to all partners, as evidenced by letters and postal receipts. Furthermore, the defendant has resided at No. 340 Heda Lane, Pu You Road, and has never moved. The plaintiff incorrectly stated the defendant's address as No. 303 Ga'en Road in the complaint, preventing the summons from being received. The plaintiff knowingly concealed this from the court and requested service by public notice, which is inconsistent with the procedures. Therefore, he requested that the plaintiff's claim be dismissed. The court, after reviewing the situation, decided to summon the remaining defendants and schedule a subsequent hearing.

### Eight Hundred Frozen Corpses in December Last Year; Eighteen Hundred Children's Corpses Collected and Buried; Statistics from Pushan Villa Alone

Since entering the depths of winter in Shanghai, many refugees and beggars exposed on the streets have frozen to death. Although the weather has slightly warmed recently, the corpses of those frozen to death have not disappeared entirely. According to reporters from Datong News Agency who inquired at Pushan Villa, the hall collected and buried three corpses of beggars who had frozen to death yesterday (31st), and twenty-eight children's corpses. The hall's burial vehicles are frequently dispatched all day long, and the wooden coffins prepared by the hall during the summer and autumn seasons have been used up. They are currently hiring craftsmen to rush to make more. Furthermore, according to the hall's statistics, last month (December of the 28th year), a total of eight hundred and fifty-eight adult corpses and one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight children's corpses were collected, totaling more than two thousand five hundred corpses. The situation is tragically appalling. However, observing the surface of Shanghai, one might not believe that in another corner, so many poor people are trapped in a living hell, freezing and starving to death.

### Chen Yongfu: Swindled Diamond Rings, Sentenced to Seven Months Imprisonment

Chen Yongfu, a native of Ningbo, is currently 25 years old. He previously worked at the Jingzu Office of Chongde Company at No. 15, Lane 466, Shanxi Road. He was on very familiar terms with Sheng Jingqing, the owner of Shengyixing Cotton Yarn Shop at No. 465 Beijing Road, a native of Shanghai. He often frequented major dance halls, seducing dance hostesses. (It is known that Sheng is the plaintiff in the recent dispute with Tang Ying, a dance hostess at the Paramount.) On November 16, Sheng's wife, Ms. Ren, entrusted Chen to pay the electricity bill of 46 yuan. Chen pocketed the money, causing the electricity to Sheng's home to be cut off. Ms. Ren, disregarding their previous friendship, reported it to the General Police Station. Chinese detective Wang Jinsheng arrested Chen at the Xin Xin billiard room. Under questioning, it was discovered that Chen had falsely used the name of Chongde Bianzu Office to defraud Li Longfu, a jade broker at No. 215, Room 33, Sichuan Road, out of three diamond rings worth 480 yuan on September 20 and 25, under the pretext of purchasing them. He gifted one of the rings to prostitute Jin Di at Yunfang Bookstore in Fuxiang Lane, and pawned the remaining two at Changsheng Pawnshop for spending money. The authorities ordered his detention and made efforts to retrieve the three original diamond rings. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit according to the law and described the case. Then Sheng Jingqing and Li Longfu presented their complaints. When questioned, Chen Yongfu's statements were evasive. The judge reviewed the evidence and sentenced Chen Yongfu to seven months of imprisonment in court as a warning.

### Yong'an Company Employees Demand Improved Treatment

Entire Staff Remains at Company; Has Not Dispersed as of This Morning

All employees of Yong'an Company, recently noting that prices are high and their salaries are insufficient to maintain their livelihood, intended to request improved treatment from the company's management. However, considering the approaching New Year's Day and the peak season, they deemed it inappropriate to make the request, fearing potential work slowdowns, which would be detrimental both publicly and privately. They therefore endured until the company closed yesterday on New Year's Eve, when they finally launched their demand. The specific content of the demands is unknown. All employees remained at the company and did not disperse. Upon receiving the news, the police station dispatched a patrol car carrying a large number of detectives to maintain order. As of 2:00 AM this morning (the 1st), the employees had not yet left. It is rumored that the company has historically maintained harmonious labor relations, and that the employees' current demands are reasonable. It is hoped that a satisfactory outcome can be achieved.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory predicted at 4:30 PM yesterday that the weather along the Chinese coast and in this area would be clear and cold, with unchanging winter monsoon conditions. Furthermore, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 6.2 degrees Celsius, and the lowest was 2.5 degrees Celsius. On the same day last year, the highest was 5.2 degrees Celsius, and the lowest was 2.5 degrees Celsius.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: Regarding the news published in your newspaper on November 24th about our company exploiting rickshaw pullers and overcharging rickshaw rents, resulting in a lawsuit filed by the Legal Department of the Public Works Department in the First Special District Court and a fine of 300 yuan, our company's rickshaws are contracted out to Zhang Baofa for subletting. The overcharging of rickshaw rents was indeed the work of the contractor. Our company notified the contractor on May 9th that the collection of rickshaw pullers' rents must comply with the Public Works Department's regulations, with 7.7 jiao as the standard and no overcharging allowed. Zhang Baofa personally signed an acknowledgment, assuming full responsibility. Therefore, our company sued the contractor in court for compensation. Yesterday, we received judgment No. 3039 of the Court's 28th Year, Yi Zi Division, ordering the defendant to compensate our company 300 yuan in national currency. Fearing confusion, we respectfully request that the editor of your newspaper publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column. We would be extremely grateful. Sincerely, Sanmin Rickshaw Company, 28th Year, 12th Month, 30th Day.

### National Reconstruction Savings Certificates and the War of Resistance Economy

— Shen Chunqi

The key to success or failure in modern warfare lies entirely in a country's ability to sustain its economy. In short-term wars, military strength is often the decisive factor, but in long-term wars, politics and economics are more important than military might, especially the latter, which is an essential factor in securing a country's final victory. During World War I, Germany fought bitterly for four years and eventually suffered defeat. This was not due to a lack of military strength compared to England and France, but rather to its economic inability to sustain the war effort.

Therefore, during wartime, cultivating a country's economic strength to support national needs is of paramount importance. Generally speaking, discussions about wartime finance revolve around methods of raising war funds, which include increasing taxes, issuing public bonds, inflating currency, obtaining foreign aid, and mobilizing resources. Among these methods, inflating currency is the fastest but also the most harmful. If adopted as a method of raising war funds in a long-term war, it can lead to detrimental effects on the national economy. Increasing taxes and issuing public bonds are relatively more stable. American financial scholar Macadoo had a "Fifty-Fifty Finance" theory, stating that war expenditures should be funded half by public bonds and half by taxes. Bogart also said that "the highest ideal of wartime finance should be primarily increasing taxes and secondarily issuing bonds." Therefore, increasing taxes and issuing bonds are necessary measures to cope with wartime finance. However, obtaining foreign aid whenever possible should not be overlooked. In addition to this, there is the mobilization of the nation's material and financial resources. Taxes and public bonds are borne by the nation's current and future resources, so increasing taxes and issuing bonds can be seen as a means of mobilizing national resources. In short, war funds are borne by the nation's resources; only the methods of mobilizing resources for national use differ!

Unrelated to Finance

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, China has also used the above methods to plan for war funds: increasing stamp tax and local liquor tax rates, revising transit taxes, levying excessive profit taxes, and preparing for the collection of inheritance taxes. It has issued 500 million yuan in National Salvation Bonds, 500 million yuan in National Defense Bonds, 100 million yuan in Relief Bonds, 600 million yuan in Military Supplies Bonds, 600 million yuan in Construction Bonds, and 100 million units in customs gold bonds, 10 million pounds in sterling bonds, and 50 million US dollars in dollar bonds. Although the amount of currency has increased by 13 billion yuan compared to before the war, this increase cannot be seen as being used to cope with war expenditures because of the rise of production enterprises in the southwest and the promotion of legal currency in the border provinces. As for foreign loans, friendly nations such as England, America, France, and the Soviet Union have helped China complete transportation construction, stabilize exchange rates, and purchase military supplies in the form of goods or currency. In terms of mobilizing resources, the state has purchased and exported four types of goods to foreign countries in exchange for military supplies: tea, tung oil, pig bristles, and minerals; and has nationalized gold to increase foreign exchange funds. However, there has been no concrete and effective method to absorb social idle funds and utilize them, which is regrettable. If social idle funds have no legitimate outlet, they will inevitably flow into speculative markets or be used for luxury consumption, weakening the strength of the War of Resistance. During wartime, all countries reward savings. For example, England issued War Savings Certificates in 1916 to absorb social idle funds, which can be seen as clear evidence. The National Government has now paid attention to this, promulgated the National Reconstruction Savings Certificate Regulations, and will organize a special publicity committee to be responsible for propaganda and promotion. The degree of importance attached can be imagined.

Content of Issuance Regulations

The National Reconstruction Savings Certificate Regulations were promulgated by the National Government on September 12 and consist of twelve articles. The main points are as follows:

Issuing Institutions: The Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau will issue them after approval by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the regulations.

Types of Issuance: Divided into two types, A and B, each divided into six classes: 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, and 1,000 yuan. Type A is registered and non-transferable and non-giftable; Type B is unregistered and freely transferable and giftable.

Interest Rate: Type A savings certificates earn 6% annual interest when held for six months, 7% annual interest when held for one year, 7.5% annual interest from the second year onwards, compounded every six months, plus a bonus of 5 cents per yuan at the end of the fifth year and a bonus of 10 cents per yuan at the end of the tenth year. Type B savings certificates have interest paid in advance, with an annual interest rate of 7% for one year, 7.5% for two years, 8% for three to five years, and 8.5% for more than five years.

Security: The assets invested by the savings are the first reserve, and the issuing bureau is directly responsible to the depositors. The government guarantees the safety of its principal and interest.

The security of the above savings certificates can be said to be extremely solid. The nature of Type A savings certificates is similar to ordinary current savings, but the interest rate is much higher than that of current savings. After being ordered to issue them, the Postal Savings Bureau actively prepared. The Chongqing, Kunming, and Guiyang branches, as well as more than 1,000 post offices in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces, issued them simultaneously around Double Ten Day. Hong Kong also issued them at the end of October. Shanghai was originally scheduled to issue them on November 1, but due to insufficient preparation, it was postponed. The Ministry of Finance has now decided to start an expanded publicity campaign today. It is expected that they will be sold out immediately upon issuance.

Beneficial to the War of Resistance Economy

It goes without saying that issuing National Reconstruction Savings Certificates will help the War of Resistance economy. The benefits are as follows:

1. This year, there have been good harvests in various regions. Farmers can earn profits when selling their products due to high prices. If this idle fund is not absorbed, it will inevitably flow into gambling or consumption. Now it can be accumulated little by little and used for profitable production investment.

2. Because of the attractive interest rates and reliable security, it stimulates people to save automatically, in line with the purpose of contributing strength if you have strength and contributing money if you have money, and completing the great cause of national reconstruction.

3. Although local financial conferences have resolved that local banks should improve the business of national reconstruction savings, the number of branches of banks is small, and they are often located in major cities, so they cannot absorb idle funds as deeply among the people as post offices. Moreover, Type B savings certificates can be transferred and gifted, so they are more convenient than bank savings and attract people to purchase them.

4. In the past, Shanghai's idle funds were abundant but lacked legitimate outlets, so people rushed to buy foreign exchange, foreign currency, or gold, and hoard goods, causing market chaos, raising prices, and weakening the strength of the War of Resistance. Although patriotic people wanted to invest in the southwest, they felt unable to achieve their goals because most financial institutions engaged in speculative transactions with the deposits they received instead of investing in production in the southwest. At a time when foreign exchange is becoming easier and discount rates are declining sharply, and large amounts of escaping funds are returning, issuing National Reconstruction Savings Certificates can move these funds from Shanghai to the southwest and curb speculation.

5. Savings represent a country's surplus funds. These funds can digest the issuance of public bonds and reduce the amount of currency issued. After people purchase savings certificates, the market can reduce the equivalent amount of currency, and the state can then use public bonds to absorb these funds and pay for war expenses. In this way, public bonds can be digested, and currency issuance can be avoided.

Moreover, savings often have a long-term nature. People will not withdraw them in the short term. The state can use these funds most safely, which is beneficial to the accumulation of people's wealth and the cultivation of economic strength.

The Duty to Serve

If National Reconstruction Savings Certificates can indeed help the War of Resistance economy as mentioned above, they can be regarded as the most ideal securities. The key lies in the people's enthusiastic purchase, saving on daily consumption, abandoning extravagant habits, and engaging in safe investment under reliable guarantees and favorable interest rates. Those who have engaged in speculative transactions in the past should also realize this and move these funds to purchase savings certificates.

From the perspective of wartime economics, the state's payment of large war expenses causes an increase in general purchasing power. Social idle funds represent this increase in purchasing power. If they can still be absorbed by the state through the issuance of National Reconstruction Savings Certificates, so that the currency in society can be reasonably balanced, it will not only benefit the national economy and people's livelihood, but also be the most ideal use of idle funds. It is hoped that the people of the country will understand the advantages and disadvantages and enthusiastically purchase them, so that both the country and individuals can benefit!

### Industrial Cooperation Movement in the Rear Area

— Zhao Dingyuan

Objective Environment

The term "industrial cooperative" is indeed a novel one in China. In the past, what China advocated and established were mostly credit cooperatives, which focused on finance. We only need to look at the statistics of past cooperatives to understand this.

Since the outbreak of the war, the battle line has been expanding and extending westward. Over time, the following problems have arisen:

1.  Relying solely on government funding to relieve millions of refugees is not a sustainable solution. The future is long, and how can supplies be maintained?

2.  As the war drags on, there will be more wounded and disabled soldiers. Those with minor injuries can indeed return to the front line to serve the country. How should the more seriously wounded and disabled, who still have the ability to work, be utilized?

3.  The interior has always been known for its poverty, but this is only a superficial view. Agricultural and mineral raw materials are abundant everywhere. On the other hand, among the millions of refugees who have fled westward from the southeastern provinces, there are no shortage of skilled workers and specialized talents. Then the question is: how can we use specialized skills and apply them to the readily available local raw materials, and further strengthen the economy of resistance?

4.  After two and a half years of hard fighting, the industrial centers in the coastal provinces have successively fallen into enemy hands. China's loss of industrial productivity is estimated to be three-quarters. In the past, industrial products, especially daily necessities, were transported from the industrial areas of Shandong to the inland provinces. From now on, the source will inevitably be cut off due to the continuation of the war and the military blockade. Then, how can we supplement the people's daily necessities and stabilize their daily lives from now on?

With so many objective circumstances, the industrial cooperative movement arose in response to the times.

Modest but Sharp

A year ago, China's first industrial cooperative for manufacturing candles and soap was established in southern Shaanxi. At that time, a group of unemployed workers timidly borrowed 2,000 yuan and started manufacturing. As a result, because these two kinds of things are widely needed by the general public, the business developed very well.

## Page 22

Soon, the principal and interest were cleared.

The basic principle of the organization of this industrial cooperative is to use the labor and skills of the members to process the raw materials produced locally. They only need simple tools and working capital. The timely emergence of these many products is due to the difficulties in transportation caused by the war, which has blocked the import of foreign goods. Even if they can be transported with great difficulty, the cost must be very expensive. Just imagine, a pair of socks in Kunming that cost at most four cents in Shanghai has to be sold for three yuan there. Therefore, the sales of products from locally manufactured industrial cooperatives are definitely not a problem.

Now, this kind of small-scale production organization is spreading widely in the interior. There are many kinds, all related to people's livelihood and resistance. Everything is available, such as spinning, making towels, weaving military blankets, making leather, making paper, and making straw sandals. There is also gold panning and coal mining and iron smelting (regarding iron smelting in the Northwest, there is a story. There was a steel smelting expert who studied in Europe and the United States. He originally worked in an enterprise under the administration of the Shanxi government. Unexpectedly, when the war broke out, he lost his job and fled to a broken temple in Shanxi alone. He was starving and cold and became a beggar. Later, he was discovered by cooperative organizers and invited him to organize the iron smelting cooperative in the Northwest. From this, we can see that there are many talented people in the refugee group). Shipbuilding, car manufacturing, and so on.

Now, the various industrial cooperatives distributed in western Sichuan, southern Hunan, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian, which are completely managed by the workers themselves, have reached more than 1,200 societies. The organization of these many cooperatives strictly follows the theory of cooperative organization. Regardless of how many shares each person participates in, each person has one vote in the election, which is completely democratic. Therefore, we say that this cooperative production form, in addition to effectively expanding production, stabilizing people's livelihood, and strengthening the economic foundation of resistance, also provides a general and effective political training to the general members in the daily work experience. This kind of training immediately has a great educational effect, which obviously has great help for the construction of democratic politics in the future.

Indusco

Now we want to talk about the Industrial Cooperative Association that promotes this industrial cooperative movement.

Let us imagine that the types of these many industrial cooperatives are so many; the distributed areas are so wide; and the complexity and dispersion of the members of the refugee groups who have fled to the interior are really to an unfathomable extent. Therefore, if you want to organize an industrial cooperative, you definitely need assistance in finance and technology. What is especially important is a kind of organizational and promotional power.

Premier Kong of the Executive Yuan, in view of this, specially allocated 500,000 yuan at the beginning of the movement, and hired Mr. Liu Qingpei, who had worked in the military, political, industrial, and commercial circles, as the general manager to be responsible for the actual planning and implementation. Under the association, there are organization, technology, publicity, finance, and general affairs levels, which are carried out separately. Because this new work, on the one hand, has objective and urgent needs, and the scope is extremely wide and the area is extremely large; on the other hand, this new work does not have enough regular rules to follow, and leaders need creative ability everywhere to open up new paths. Therefore, the success of this movement not only depends on the creative genius and the perseverance of the organizers, but also on the ability to call on a large number of enthusiastic intellectuals to participate together and exert a spirit of perseverance to jointly promote this production movement that is of great importance to China's survival.

Here, what we must first mention is our international friend, Mr. Rewi Alley. In order to enthusiastically respond to this great movement last year, he specially resigned from the position of director and supervisor of the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council and rushed to the interior to participate. He is the technical advisor of the association and regularly inspects and guides western Sichuan and northwestern regions.

In addition, overseas Chinese are also very concerned about this movement. Several young engineers who live in Canada have come to participate and directly provide assistance. In this new great movement, the young intellectuals have found the work they should do and the positions they should hold.

Training Work

Since the talents required for this movement are very many, the training work is constantly being carried out.

(1) Training for co-operators—This training period is very short, only one or two weeks, because they are eager to use it and can't wait. The training items include the use of new machines, cooperative theory, bookkeeping, and other political and moral training. Each class trains about 50 people. After the training, they return to their hometowns to work and teach other community friends at the same time.

(2) Training for cooperative organizers—There are now two training institutions: one in Shaanxi and one in Jiangxi. It is planned to set up another one in Guangdong in the future. This kind of training period is longer, lasting three months, with 40 people in each class. In the Northwest Training School in Shaanxi, two classes have graduated; in the school in the South, one class has graduated. This kind of school has a term of three months, costing 1,500 to 2,000 yuan, which includes all the expenses of teachers and students. Of course, in addition to their homework, students also have to do various daily life tasks, such as washing clothes, sweeping the floor, wiping tables, and wiping lamps. Sometimes there are not enough houses, so they have to build some simple houses themselves. In the month before graduation, they go to various cooperatives or shops to practice. When they graduate, they become a cooperative organizer and go to the countryside to organize cooperatives. This is indeed a powerful new force for promoting cooperation.

Three Types of Indusco

The industrial cooperatives that are booming in the interior are divided into three different forms according to the wartime environment and needs:

(1) Mobile cooperatives in the front-line war zone, which belong to the first economic defense line. The scale of this kind of cooperative is probably very small. The general production tools and machines are also very simple, advancing and retreating with the military. It is of great help to the lives of the people in the war zone. This economic defense line includes six provinces: Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui. The headquarters is located in Ji'an in southern Jiangxi, and later moved to Ganzhou. Mr. Rewi Alley is the director of the area, paying special attention to the development of ceramics, sugar, paper and other industries.

(2) Cooperatives located in the middle zone between the front and rear, forming the second economic defense line. The cooperatives here are responsible for communicating and connecting the first and third types of cooperatives. This is the southwest defense line, and the headquarters is located in Shaoyang, Hunan.

(3) Industrial cooperatives in relatively safe provinces, assisting the production of industries that have already been established in the area and serving as its affiliated agencies. This is the third economic defense line, also known as the northwest defense line. The headquarters is located in Shiji in southern Shaanxi, where industrial cooperation already has a good foundation and has been widely developed.

The general agency of the Cooperative Association, which is responsible for the overall implementation, is located in Chongqing, where the National Government is located, so as to obtain the guidance and supervision of the Executive Yuan at any time. This vast and brand-new industrial cooperative movement, with the enthusiastic support of the government and the public, will surely achieve great success. Conclusion

Originally, the poverty of Chinese villages was mostly due to insufficient productivity. According to Mr. Buck, a professor of rural economics at Jinling University, Chinese farmers only work on farms for more than 90 days a year. Therefore, it is said that Chinese farmers are already in a state of semi-unemployment. How can they become rich in a state of unemployment?

Therefore, in the current stage of China, it is advocated to promote the industrial cooperative movement, organize semi-unemployed farmers, and teach them knowledge and skills in the manufacturing of industrial products, so that they can apply some artificial skills to the raw materials produced locally, increase its effectiveness, and increase its value. Make use of the farmers' leisure time, and wealth will gradually increase, and life will gradually improve. Therefore, we hope that this vigorous industrial cooperative movement can—

(1) In today's war, exert its great power to support and strengthen this national resistance war of life and death and achieve the final victory. (2) In the peaceful future, assist and prosper the rural economy, and then promote the national construction movement. (End)

### Market Knowledge Consultant

Mr. Lu Xiuchuan asked: I would be grateful if you could answer the following questions:

(1) Is the Shanghai mark gold price calculated based on the British pure gold price? Is each ounce equal to 12 taels of the old system?

(2) Does the customs gold unit price (central listing price) refer to the legal tender converted into customs gold? Or customs gold converted into legal tender?

(3) Does the collection price of the silver equalization tax refer to the weight of silver? Is the tax rate price legal tender or foreign currency?

(4) What is the weight of the British gold pound and the US gold dollar? And their fineness ratio?

(5) For interbank exchange rates in various countries: is the British exchange rate calculated in the currency of the country (England)? Is the US exchange rate calculated by converting the currency of other countries into the currency of the country (US)?

(6) What is the unit of weight for overseas silver prices such as British, American and Indian?

(7) Where are shareholders bought and sold in Shanghai? How does it trade?

(8) Does the price of American, Indian and British cotton refer to the weight of cotton?

(9) Does the wheat market trading in the United States and Canada refer to the weight of wheat?

(10) What is the currency price of a pound tone (that is, what fraction)? Is it a subsidiary currency of the British currency system?

Mr. Pan Hengqin replied: There are too many questions, so I can only answer briefly as follows. (1) Yes, see this journal in the previous issue. Each ounce is equal to 0.6221 market jin, or 0.5217 old jin.

(2) It is the price of customs gold converted into legal tender. The formula is customs gold pure gold content 0.1935 multiplied by the London pure gold price, and then divided by the statutory price of the British exchange rate.

(3) The silver equalization tax announced by the Central Bank is a tax rate, not a tax amount. Paid in legal tender.

(4) The weight and fineness of major foreign currencies such as British and American are as follows:

The British gold ocean is worth four pounds, and the US gold ocean is worth twenty dollars; the half value is two pounds for British and ten dollars for American; the weight is calculated according to the above example, and the color is the same.

The market price of gold coins is slightly different from the spot price due to the relationship between supply and demand.

The price of gold coins is about 60% to 110% higher than the price of foreign exchange and gold notes.

(5) Yes, the British exchange rate is the number of the national currency of a foreign country equivalent to one pound. The US exchange rate is the number of US dollars equivalent to the national currency of a foreign country. For example, according to the telegram on the 29th of last month, the British exchange rate against the US was $4.02 and against the French was 176 francs, which is the number of US dollars and francs equivalent to one pound. On the same day, the US exchange rate against the British was $3.95625 and against the French was $2.245, which is $3.95625 equivalent to one pound and $2.245 equivalent to one hundred francs.

(6) British silver is calculated per standard ounce, American silver is calculated per troy ounce. Indian silver is calculated per 100 rupees, which is approximately 180 English points, or 1.1664 centimeters.

(7) The market of the Chinese Stock Exchange also has auctions, but they are mostly concentrated in the Public Industry Association. You can entrust a stockbroker. However, under the current speculative situation, the risk is very high. If you are interested in investing, it is better to buy government bonds or national construction savings bonds, which are stable and profitable, and also in line with national identity.

Items 8, 9, and 3 have been answered by a cotton expert in this journal in the next issue.

Mr. Cai Jidong: The principles of the calculation method of remittance and discounting you asked about will be published in a special article in this journal soon.

### Grain Prices - Year-End Closing - Only Shops Replenish Rice - No Major Fluctuations in Sales Prices

Recently, rice noodles from the inland areas arriving via the Hongkou District have been reaching the market daily. Yesterday, due to the year-end closing period and being a Sunday, there were no new arrivals, and imported rice was also completely out of stock. It is expected that supplies will steadily arrive after the holiday. As for market transactions, most rice merchants are planning to close their books. However, shops have slightly replenished their supplies to meet immediate needs, while others have remained inactive. At the same time, sellers are not planning to sell much more, and banks and warehouses have already closed, making it impossible to display samples. As a result, the market is lacking in goods. Total transactions throughout the city were only two to three thousand bags, so the market has not changed and remains stable. Prices are based on the original levels. For example, the price of early and late rice from Nangang is between 38 yuan and 122 jiao to 38 yuan. The price of high-quality Jing rice from Su, Tong, and Li Sheng is 40 yuan, and the price of medium-quality Jing rice is between 39 yuan and a half to 39 yuan. For other prices, see the market price section.

### Finance - Bank Reserve Committee Sets - December Remittance Deposit Interest

4.5 Yuan Per Thousand

The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee has set the interbank remittance deposit interest rate for December at 4.5 yuan per thousand (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 4.5%), and has already sent a circular to all banks for reference and implementation. The December interest rate for interbank borrowing, as decided by the Money Industry Association, is also 4.5 yuan, which is the same for both.

### Sugar Market - Coarse Granulated White Sugar Prices Rise Again

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be tight. The Public Zeng Exchange had its levels. The spot price for 24-type coarse white sugar from the local warehouse was 59 yuan, up 0.2 yuan. The price for newly arrived sugar from warehouses outside the port was 59.8 yuan, up 0.3 yuan. The price for old goods was 59.5 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. The price for re-exported goods remained unchanged. The price for Taikoo granulated white sugar rose by 0.3 yuan to 0.8 yuan. The price for B-mark East warehouse sugar was 59.2 yuan, and the price for West warehouse sugar was between 59.8 yuan and 5 yuan. The price for CX mark sugar was 59 yuan.

The price of local No. 1 rock sugar also rose by 0.5 yuan, to 70 yuan. The price for Jingming rock sugar was 71.5 yuan. The price for domestically produced Diaoqing sugar was relatively loose because some parties were also shipping it in. The market is expected to soften.

### North-South Goods - Orchid Bamboo Branches Open Up Two or Three Yuan

Due to the limited recent arrivals and thin market inventory of orchid bamboo branches, coupled with the limited stock held by brokers, the sales, although not particularly brisk, are still decent. Therefore, the asking price for high-quality goods has risen by two or three yuan. The asking price for selected orchid bamboo is 120 yuan. Glutinous rice branches are being shipped in from time to time, and the asking price is falling.

### Coal - Coal Dust Rises Clearly but Subtly

The trend in the coal market is to rise clearly but subtly. In particular, the arrival of coal dust is sporadic, and sales are brisk. Vendors are taking the opportunity to raise prices, and buyers have no choice but to accept higher prices due to their needs. Therefore, the gray market is particularly lively. Yesterday, 600 to 700 tons of Keelung coal dust were sold. The price for coal dust after screening and redistribution among the industry was 78 yuan per ton, with an additional 4 yuan for transportation to the customer.
