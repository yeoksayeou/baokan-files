Hong Kong: The U.S. State Department has ordered the American mail steamer President Coolidge to return to Hong Kong. The ship departed from Hong Kong for Manila only twelve hours ago. Next Friday, 4,000 British women and children will be evacuated to Manila. American sources here believe that the U.S. government's order for the President Coolidge to return to Hong Kong is to load American citizens for departure. However, the American Consul General here stated that the consulate has not received any instructions from Washington. The President Coolidge left Hong Kong for Manila at 6:00 AM this morning, carrying ninety first-class passengers and thirty-five tourist class passengers, most of whom had reserved tickets. Their purpose should not be regarded as refugees. After receiving the American order, the ship returned to Hong Kong at 6:00 PM, exactly twelve hours after its departure.

Guangzhou: The Japanese army in South China issued a statement this morning, saying that whenever the Hong Kong authorities were notified 24 hours in advance of Japanese military operations along the border, they would leak Japanese military secrets to Chongqing. This was said to be based on a written order issued by General Chiang Kai-shek for the Chinese army to withdraw from the border area, which mentioned information obtained from the British authorities. The statement also said that the Japanese would no longer provide information about their operations in the border areas, for which they expressed their regret. (Reuters, 30th dispatch)

### British and French Far East Policies Remain Unchanged; Vietnamese Nationalist Party Asks for Japanese Aggression to be Stopped

Chongqing: According to a Central News Agency dispatch, the British and French ambassadors recently decided here, as a result of talks, that the British and French authorities in China would continue to cooperate on Far Eastern affairs. The news agency continued, stating that even if the Japanese exerted pressure on Hong Kong and Vietnam, British and French Far Eastern policies would remain unchanged. Furthermore, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party has issued a petition requesting the Chongqing National Government to quickly take effective measures to stop the Japanese from seizing Vietnam. The petition stated, "If France does not want to forfeit its historical honor and does not want to see the French Empire reduced to a state of eternal ruin, then it is not too late to salvage the current situation. Indochina, with its abundant resources and large population, can provide all the resources for France's revival. France's acceptance of Japanese demands is absolutely unforgivable. Our party, representing the people of Indochina, expresses our desire, hoping that the French government will immediately restore the freedoms of speech, publication, assembly, and armament to the people of Indochina. Under these conditions, we are willing to cooperate with France and will not hesitate to engage in war to resist the aggressors of Asia. If France ignores the needs of its people, we will not sit idly by and watch our future destiny. France has an obligation to protect Indochina, but no right to sell it. We request that the Chinese National Government quickly take effective measures to prevent changes to the sovereignty of Vietnam and provide our party with the highest assistance. We are willing to fulfill the obligation to protect Vietnam under the cooperation of the Chinese, French, and Vietnamese governments." (United Press, 30th dispatch)

Hong Kong has already declared martial law.

Stockholm: A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated to foreign reporters yesterday that the world's attention has now shifted from Romania to the Far East. London received official reports yesterday morning confirming that Hong Kong has declared martial law. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Hong Kong only declared martial law once, on June 12, 1937. This time, it is because Japanese warships will declare a blockade of the entire Chinese coast starting next Wednesday (July 3), which will completely isolate Hong Kong, hence the need to take martial law measures. The British Governor has instructed British women and children to evacuate first, indicating that the situation is very critical. Within the next two days, 600 women and children will be sent to Manila. According to a London radio report, the Australian government has announced its willingness to receive the evacuees from Hong Kong, so British citizens will be transferred to Australia after arriving in Manila. Regarding this matter, the United Kingdom is consulting with the U.S. government, with Ambassador Lord Lothian discussing solutions with U.S. Secretary of State Hull. Australian representatives also participated in the meeting yesterday, with very detailed discussions on protecting the Far Eastern interests of the United Kingdom and the United States. London acknowledges that Japan's attitude towards the United Kingdom has become more assertive in recent days. Although the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin has just been lifted, Foreign Minister Arita's notification to British Ambassador Craig has made the situation suddenly serious. Arita declared that in the future, Japan would not tolerate any assistance from Western countries to the Chinese Central Government under any circumstances. According to Arita's interpretation, "assistance" includes (1) military supplies, (2) military equipment, (3) raw materials, and (4) economic assistance. Arita emphasized that Far Eastern countries have direct and natural relationships in terms of geography, history, race, and economy, and must help each other. Any third country engaging in anti-Japanese activities in the Far East will not be tolerated by Japan. (Haitong News Agency, 30th dispatch)

The Eastern Henan Puppet Army: Three Divisions Revolt

Luoyang: Zhou Lanyi, the puppet pacification director of eastern Henan, commands three divisions of puppet troops, the strongest force among the puppet armies in eastern Henan. Previously, under environmental pressure, he had no choice but to temporarily submit to the Japanese.

### Weekly Battle Situation: June 23rd to 29th

The Chinese army is using magnet tactics, attracting the enemy step by step to achieve the goal of gradual annihilation. The Japanese, who were plotting in Guangdong and Guangxi, have not succeeded under the fierce attacks of the Chinese army. The Chinese army on the other fronts has also inflicted great defeats on the stubborn Japanese, repeatedly winning victories. The progress of the battle is summarized as follows:

On the west bank of the Xiang River in Hubei Province, the main force of the Japanese army is still in Dangyang and its eastern region. In addition, in the Jingmen, Yichang, and Jiangling areas, the Japanese also have considerable forces stubbornly defending. In Shenjiaji, Shayang, and Shilipu, there are a small number of Japanese troops hiding in the towns, not daring to move rashly. Since last week, the Chinese defending army has completed a strong encirclement of the Japanese in each location and continued to carry out the most violent attacks. Seeing the dangerous situation, the Japanese strengthened their fortifications and stubbornly held out. However, after the Chinese army's planned separate encirclement and suppression, the remaining peripheral units of the Japanese army in each location have been wiped out, and the goal of attracting the Japanese and annihilating them gradually has been successfully achieved. At the same time, the Chinese elite troops in the rear launched brave attacks in Hubei, capturing various crossings of the Xiang River and encircling Zhongshen and Yangzi. In southern Hubei, they fiercely attacked Chongyang, Tongcheng, and Xianning, recovering Zhaoliqiao and cutting off the Japanese army's transportation on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway. In eastern Hubei, they rushed into Donglousi, Huayuan, and other places, and attacked Wushengguan, forcing the Japanese. The traffic on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway was also completely controlled by the Chinese army. Where the large army arrived, they repeatedly defeated the stubborn Japanese, causing the Japanese who ventured blindly in the western Xiang River area to have their rear lines cut off, falling into a state of panic and despair.

Since being defeated by the Chinese army last week, the Japanese army invading Shangsi, Suilu, Funan, and other places in southern Guangxi, taking advantage of the changes in the European situation, resumed their westward offensive in two routes. The main force moved along Mingjiang and Tutu towards Ningming, and a part crossed the Zuojiang River and invaded Chongshan, aiming to threaten Annam by joining forces to attack Longzhou. The Chinese army launched fierce attacks separately, capturing thousands of enemy troops. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. Since the beginning of the month, the Japanese army in southern Guangdong has invaded the area north of Conghua and was severely defeated and retreated. Last week, the

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that the fighting this week was still more intense west of the Xiang River. The main force of the invading Japanese army landed at Nantou, which belongs to Bao'an County, and invaded Shenzhen, Shatoujiao, Shayuchong, Longgang, Pingshan, and other places to the east, forming a large encirclement around Kowloon, attempting to control Dapeng Bay and threaten British Hong Kong. They are now being fiercely countered by the Chinese.

The Chinese army in northern Hunan and Jiangxi launched rapid and skillful actions to attack Japanese strongholds, making rapid and smooth progress. They successively captured many strongholds near Yanglousi, and recovered the important strategic location of Huxingshan on the outskirts of Yueyang, annihilating many Japanese troops. The Chinese army attacking Nanchang fiercely in northern Jiangxi took advantage of the victory to advance, successively capturing important strongholds such as Cimu, Wanchu, Chazan on the southeast side of Nanchang, and Shengmi Street on the southwest side. The Japanese repeatedly decided to reinforce and counterattack, but were defeated each time, killing more than 2,000 Japanese troops, destroying many tanks, capturing more than 20 heavy and light machine guns, and capturing more than 70 Japanese officers and soldiers. The Chinese mobile units also moved towards the rear of the Japanese, destroying major road bridges and attacking the Japanese airfield east of Nanchang, capturing many enemy troops and destroying many Japanese vehicles. In addition, after the Chinese army captured Songbu and other places, they are currently besieging Anyi. Many strongholds near Wuning have also been captured. The Japanese have repeatedly attempted to counterattack, but have not succeeded. They are still closely encircling and attacking the Japanese. (To be continued, 30th dispatch)

### Southeast of Nanchang: The Chinese Army Captures Many Strongholds; Part of the Surprise Troops Advance to the Eastern Suburbs of the City

Fengcheng: The fighting southeast of Nanchang is actively unfolding. Zhuhe Bridge, Chenzhuang, Xunshang, and Qinluojiaji have all been captured. Part of the Chinese surprise troops advanced to Taozhutong in the eastern suburbs of Nanchang, attacking Nanchang. (30th dispatch)

### The Japanese Army in Northwestern Shanxi: The Invasion Fails

Xi'an: The Japanese and puppet forces in northwestern Shanxi recently launched a large-scale invasion in three routes. One route advanced from Sanchabao to Shaqquan Town, and another route sneaked into Ta'ershe (south of Baode) from Xingxian at noon on the 22nd. They were all defeated separately by the Chinese army.

### Triplets Born from One Pregnancy: All Three Simultaneously Request to Enlist

Ningxia: Xu Rang, the civil affairs officer of the first district of Tongxin County, has three younger brothers who were born from one pregnancy to his mother. This year, they are all sixteen years old. Because Xu Rang repeatedly heard Chairman Ma's earnest talks on the significance of the war of resistance and the obligation of the people to serve in the military when he came to the province for training two months ago, he was deeply moved. After returning to the county, he discussed with his mother, expressing his willingness to send his three younger brothers into the army to serve the country. His mother also understood the importance of the matter and expressed her strong support. Thus, a few days ago, she personally sent the three sons born from one pregnancy to the province, requesting that Chairman Ma inspect and accept them. Chairman Ma, because the three sons of the Xu family had not yet reached the age of conscription, immediately sent them to the junior cadre training class established by the Provisional × Division for training and gave them generous rewards. It has been found that it is rare in ancient and modern times for triplets to be born from one pregnancy and all have grown up, and it is especially commendable that the common woman Xu sent three sons to join the army at the same time.

Editorial

### How to Rebuild the World Order

The various events that have occurred one after another recently have plunged the world almost entirely into an abyss of turmoil, causing the vast majority of nations and peoples to experience unparalleled suffering in life and spirit. Only a few who are engaged in conquest and domination are smug. Although similar experiences are not difficult to find in history, the scope and impact of these current events are vastly different from any previous precedents.

The vast majority of people are deeply saddened by the formation of this situation, but those who are engaged in conquest and domination also have their arguments: for example, saying "This is a struggle between 'haves' and 'have-nots,'" "This is to ensure regional security," "This is to promote world order and peace," "This is to implement a plan to transform the world." Opposed to this kind of argument is power, not theory; moreover, at the juncture when all means have failed and one finally has no choice but to resort to war, theoretical disputes are even less of a question. Although the abyss of turmoil is only a temporary abnormal phenomenon, the normal demands of mankind are not turmoil but lasting peace and stability; therefore, how a world order can be truly established has become an issue that must be seriously considered.

An order that hopes to maintain lasting peace and stability must be built on a foundation of absolute equality to be effective; and its participants must also be out of a voluntary desire, not forced and out of helplessness. If it is entirely due to the oppression of force, or is only to carry out the will of the dominators, then even if a superficial order is created with difficulty, it will be difficult to achieve stability and durability; the existence of internal contradictions, even if temporarily at peace, will eventually lead to the outbreak of new conflicts or disturbances. Looking at the current example, did the Treaty of Versailles not once bring order and peace? However, on the other hand, it was precisely because of the lack of the above-mentioned basic considerations that it became the fuse for the European War and the recent disputes. There are truly countless examples of this kind in history; it is a pity that the effect of its lessons has not been deeply developed, and instead, some people have intensified their efforts, saying that order and peace can be established under conquest and domination, which is fundamentally a logic of domination.

Between people, there was also a stage in the past where the phenomenon of the strong bullying the weak and the many bullying the few existed. But finally, with the progress of human civilization, in today's society, generally speaking, everyone has the same right to survival and freedom. But between countries, the traditions of the barbaric era still remain to this day. Small and weak countries still cannot obtain the guarantee of survival and freedom. Sometimes they are subjected to horizontal oppression, sometimes they are tragically sacrificed, and sometimes their survival is even threatened; but they cannot find a place to accept their complaints and provide strong and effective support. This is one of the most unreasonable situations in the international community today, and at the same time, it is the main reason for some wars. A small and weak country under the control of a strong country not only is not enough to guarantee the safety of the weak, but instead promotes the danger of another kind of war—a war for hegemony. To re-divide the world is nothing more than to divide the opposing forces in the international community more sharply and clearly, so the future disasters of war are even more terrible. Therefore, if one wants to re-establish world order, one must first ensure that the weak and the strong have the same right to survival, realize absolute equality and freedom, and completely eliminate all phenomena of conquest and domination. These are the most basic conditions, and to talk about order without this basic premise is either ignorance or deception.

In today's world, where violence is rampant and justice is hidden, mankind's calamity is unknown when it will end. Therefore, only using strength to fight against the darkness is the only way to solve all problems; but the above is a basic belief that is worth adhering to at all times. As long as this world does not perish due to the arrival of brute force, the reconstruction of the future international order must take the struggle of the weak to obtain free and equal survival as the beginning of light.

### Axis Powers Exert Pressure on Hungary and Bulgaria to Prevent the European War from Spreading to the Balkans; Bidding Them to Fully Focus on Dealing with the War Against Britain; Romanian King Carol Seeks Aid in Rome

Rome: Roman sources share the same perspective as Berlin regarding a peaceful resolution to the Soviet-Romanian issue. Well-informed Italian sources claim that one of the main objectives of the Axis powers is to maintain peace in the Balkans and prevent the expansion of the European war. Regarding the Hungarian-Bulgarian issue, Italian figures believe it can be addressed after the most pressing European problems are resolved. (Haitong Telegram, 30th)

Budapest: The atmosphere here greatly eased yesterday, as authoritative sources reported that Italy has advised Hungary and Bulgaria to exercise patience. They were told to wait until Britain is defeated before making demands on Romania. Official circles believe Berlin has informed Rome that demands on the Danube should be temporarily postponed until Britain surrenders, to avoid conflict with Romania or the Soviet Union. (United Press Telegram, 30th)

Bucharest: Two million Romanian soldiers are now prepared to resist any threats to partition the country's territory. However, officials state there is no immediate danger of war. According to unconfirmed but reliable reports last night, King Carol of Romania is currently in Rome, hoping Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will prevent actions by Hungary and Bulgaria. Last night, authoritative sources told United Press reporters that Germany and Italy have not given Romania guarantees regarding the Soviet Union's entry into Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. This is because Romania has accepted the Soviet Union's promise to fully respect Romania's borders, and the Axis powers see no need to provide Romania with guarantees. Romanian troops have now arrived at their new borders. (United Press Telegram, 30th)

Bucharest: Official circles here deny foreign reports that the Soviet Union is demanding bases on the Danube and the Black Sea, and refute rumors of border clashes between Romania and Hungary, and Romania and Bulgaria. Romanian newspapers consider the loss of Bessarabia and Bukovina an unavoidable matter. The pro-German "Current Affairs" newspaper hopes that what Romania has lost now can soon be restored with German assistance. Political figures fear that Soviet demands will extend to the Black Sea and the Tartar Strait. According to some opinions, Romania will temporarily comply with Soviet demands while rapidly strengthening its political, economic, and military cooperation with Germany. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)

Sofia: Bulgaria remained calm yesterday in response to Romania's mobilization. Authoritative sources also told United Press reporters that Bulgaria has not mobilized. The official number of armed forces in Bulgaria is not disclosed, but unofficial estimates range from one million to two million. The Bulgarian government appears to still be adopting peaceful means to achieve its territorial demands. According to a person close to the government, "We not only cannot reclaim Dobruja by force, but we have absolutely no intention of using force to achieve our wishes. However, we believe that if we are patient, we can peacefully reclaim the area. Moreover, we firmly believe that our demands are just. Our main goal now is to avoid war."

Red Army Continues to Advance in Romanian Territory, Occupying All Ceded Areas

Bucharest: The Romanian General Staff issued a communiqué, stating that after Romania accepted the Soviet government's ultimatum, Soviet troops entered Bessarabia on the morning of June 28th. On the same day, Romanian troops began to withdraw, handing over the towns of Chernivtsi in Bukovina and Chisinau and Alba Iulia in Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. By noon on June 29th, the ceded areas had been handed over one after another. Romanian troops and civilians are still withdrawing according to the predetermined plan. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)

Moscow: Yesterday, Soviet troops continued to advance in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina according to the original plan. Today, Soviet troops entered Storozhynets and Kitsman in Northern Bukovina, and occupied Novoselytsia and Lipcani station (south of Radauti) on the Prut River. Mechanized units have approached the Prut River, 55 kilometers southwest of Marculesti. They also reached Beltsy (80 kilometers northwest of Chisinau). Soviet paratroopers have occupied Bolgrad in southern Bessarabia, only a few kilometers from Reni, where the Danube and Prut rivers meet. (TASS Telegram, 30th)

Bucharest: The Propaganda Department announced that the new Soviet-Romanian border is the same as Romania's pre-World War I northern boundary, from the Soviet-Polish border along the Sasiva River to the pre-World War I boundary, and then south along the Prut River to the Danube and into the Black Sea. (United Press Telegram, 30th)

Romania Endures Painful Cession of Territory, Justice Will Surely Prevail One Day

Bucharest: Romania's new Minister of Propaganda, Alexandru Rădulescu, told the press yesterday that the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Bukovina was a "disaster" for Romania and an unjust act. However, he also believes that the Soviet action has averted a greater disaster in Southeastern Europe. Rădulescu said, "We endure this disaster to avoid a greater one. Although we have been treated extremely unfairly, we do not feel disappointed. We have suffered, and we will continue to endure hardship. Whether justice will be granted in the future, we will unite all our forces to pursue our sacred mission until this injustice is rectified." (United Press Telegram, 30th)

### London Times Comments on the Balkan Situation: Three Countries Watch Each Other with Suspicion, Soviet Action Took the Lead

London: The Sunday "Times" expressed doubts about whether the Soviet Union's recent occupation of Bessarabia was with German consent. In an article titled "The Soviet Action," the newspaper stated that since the collapse of France, one of Hitler's most likely actions has been to advance eastward. Stalin was eager to take the lead, so he decisively annexed Bessarabia and tightened his grip on the Baltic states. However, the Balkans are a more explosive region than the Baltic. The countries from Romania to Greece have formed an area where Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union each have separate and conflicting interests. So far, there is no sign that these three countries have reached a compromise under a partition plan. They may eventually reach such a compromise, but based on the current situation, Germany and Italy both appear surprised and unwelcome to the Soviet Union's actions. Now, three cats are standing around the food they have obtained, watching each other suspiciously. If one of them suddenly reaches out to grab it, the other two will inevitably follow. The repercussions of this matter will soon affect our allied country, Turkey. If that country had actively joined our side earlier, its position would be much stronger today. Calvinus also published an article on this matter in the Visiteur, stating that we are now witnessing the beginning, not the end, of the Romanian problem. The content of this drama is very complex and may have several acts and intermissions. The Soviet Union has no emotional attachments to the present and no illusions about the future. It will do what it should as soon as there is an opportunity. At the same time, the Soviet Union has a long-term vision and does not aim to fight the Axis powers, either now or in the future. If we think otherwise, we are neglecting the thoughts of the thoughtful. The more basic principles and the larger decisions in "Mein Kampf" can only be realized by reworking the "opening to the East" on the final scale. This is the great Teutonic expansion, from the Balkans to the Caucasus and Baku. The large-scale aggression Germany has carried out in Western and Northern Europe has gone too far in terms of Soviet interests. Therefore, it is necessary to limit Italy's activities in the Balkans. The collapse of France and the Soviet Union's advice have kept Turkey out of the war. However, from an obvious perspective, Turkey's defense will not be weakened in any way by the Axis powers. The Dardanelles and Bosporus straits must not be threatened directly or indirectly. Syria and Palestine must not fall into Italian hands. This situation is not without benefit to Britain. They are the guardians of the Eastern Mediterranean, preventing the spread of unrest. Russia, under the Soviet system, as it was under the imperial system, is now again the hope of all Slavs. This will be the fundamental instinct to resist Nazism, which seeks to degrade the Slavic race. The more Hitler seeks to change, the more he remains the same. He is now only changing his methods and the order of his procedures. Several formidable principles in "Mein Kampf" belong to the fixed foundation of his mind and purpose. Hitler will build a great empire unprecedented in history with power and racial superiority. This must be firmly established and maintain hegemony for many centuries to come, and cannot be broken. To achieve this goal, every possible strong enemy near it must be defeated and prevented from recovering. The oil and grain produced by Romania are not enough to achieve this. Unprecedented illusions and long-term hegemony require the fertile land of Ukraine and the oil fields of Baku. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)

### The Soviet Union Upholds a Policy of Peace; The Resolution of the Soviet-Romanian Issue Provides Clear Evidence

Moscow: Regarding the Soviet troops entering Romania, "Izvestia" commented: "At 2:00 PM yesterday, our heroic Red Army began crossing the Romanian border. This border was created by the conspiracies and instigations of Western imperialists, and the Soviet Union has never recognized it. The Red Army's entry into Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina is not as conquerors. They are by no means enemies of the people there; in fact, they are friends of those forced to leave their homeland. The Red Army's advance in Romanian territory has been warmly welcomed by the people. This is a direct result of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and the peaceful resolution of the Soviet-Romanian dispute. The Soviet-Romanian dispute over Bessarabia has lasted for 22 years. The secession of Bessarabia from the Soviet Union was directly involved in by the victors of Versailles. They took advantage of the weakness of the Soviet Union's military forces after the revolution and used various methods to weaken the Soviet Union's strength. At the same time, Soviet reactionaries also participated in this, as they only cared about the interests of their bankrupt class and disregarded the life and death of the motherland. Romania's seizure of Bessarabia was based on the decision of a certain group. This group, which called itself a group, actually had no relationship with the people of Bessarabia. The 'group' had a total of 162 members, but it decided to annex Bessarabia with only 38 votes. The Soviet Union has never recognized this injustice and destructive action. In the past 22 years, the Soviet Union has repeatedly mentioned the importance of resolving the Bessarabia issue. Most recently, at the sixth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Soviet People's Commissar Molotov also mentioned this issue. Although the Soviet Union has never mentioned using force to recover Bessarabia, it has also not recognized the area being seized by Romania. After Molotov delivered this speech, the Soviet Union sent an ambassador to Bucharest (the then Soviet ambassador to Romania had been vacant for two and a half years). The Soviet Union believes that the failure to resolve the issue is not the fault of Romania itself. Therefore, the Soviet Union intends to resolve it in a purely peaceful way. The resolution of the obvious dispute between the two neighboring countries is a great contribution to peace. The agreement recently concluded between the Soviet Union and Romania is especially valuable for maintaining peace, as the nature and duration of the dispute have hindered the friendly relations between the two countries. Moreover, the agreement was signed at a time when the international situation is most complex, so its value is even more precious. The flames of war have spread to various countries, and we have witnessed countless important historical changes. The knots of international contradictions caused by imperialism have been broken by swords and guns. In this environment, the Soviet Union continues its peaceful policy. Even for injustices such as the Bessarabia issue, the Soviet Union is unwilling to resort to force. Although the need to resolve the issue quickly is very clear, any dispute resolved by mutual agreement can consolidate the peace of all powers. The Soviet-Romanian agreement fully meets the above conditions. The agreement has not only resolved the Bessarabia issue but has also resolved the Northern Bukovina issue, which is related to the issue. Northern Bukovina has close ties to Soviet Ukraine in terms of language and structure. Since the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the workers and peasants of Bukovina have demanded that the province be incorporated into Soviet Ukraine. This demand was made by the National Assembly of the area at that time. In short, the incorporation of Bukovina into Romania was also instigated by the then omnipotent Little Entente. The so-called unanimous demand of Romanians to annex Bukovina is a fabrication. From this point of view, the resolution of the Soviet-Romanian dispute is also the resolution of another unjust historical event. Moreover, Romania's rule over Bessarabia for 22 years has caused great losses to the Soviet Union. The transfer of Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union can be used to compensate for the losses to the Soviet Union. Whether it is the Soviet Union or the people of Bessarabia, they oppose the province being ruled by Romania. They have suffered oppression and hardship under 22 years of rule. This can be proved by the repeated uprisings of the people of the province. The Soviet Union has now opened up a great socialist path for Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. They will move forward hand in hand with their Soviet brothers, protected by the Stalin Constitution and the great Red Army. Undoubtedly, the poverty of the past has disappeared, and from now on, the people of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina will enjoy a happy and comfortable life. In the bloody battlefield of capitalism, the great Soviet Union, in obedience to the will of the people and its leaders, remains aloof from the situation. The Soviet Union is now working hard to resolve all disputes in order to eliminate the hidden dangers. Although the Soviet Union resolves all disputes in its own way, the resolution of the Soviet-Romanian issue is clear evidence of this. In addition to congratulating the people of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, the Soviet working masses express their support for the wise and peaceful Stalin policy, for without such wise guidance, there would be no such good results."

### German Troops Take a Short Break, Preparing for a Large-Scale Attack on Britain, Commander of French Forces in the Near East Surrenders, London Feels Disappointed

Rome: Italian newspapers indicated yesterday that, although the situation in the Balkans is urgent, direct military action by the Axis powers against Britain is inevitable. Evening newspapers claimed that German policy is to take the shortest possible break between two decisive battles, and Germany is determined to fight a major battle with British forces soon. "We are now going through a preparation period. If the German High Command continues to adhere to the policy of taking the shortest possible break during consecutive battles, then a large-scale attack on Britain is not far off. The current battle has reached its peak." "The Literary Newspaper stated that it is difficult to be sure where and how Germany will attack Britain, but those along the English Channel firmly believe that an attack is inevitable. After France's surrender, Britain can no longer import iron ore, iron soil, and French military industrial products, while Germany, in addition to looting other spoils of war, has tens of millions of liters of volatile and flammable liquids." The Fascist newspaper declared, "Germany and Italy are determined to force British forces to fight immediately." (United Press Telegram, 30th)

### The United States' Attitude Towards the Far East Will Not Change, Believing Arita's Speech Was Intended for Domestic Consumption, American Interests in the Dutch East Indies Cannot Be Ignored

Washington: It appears that the United States does not agree with the Monroe Doctrine for the Far East announced by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. The US government has consistently opposed Japan's plan for a New Order in East Asia. Officials here stated today that, no matter what happens in the world, this attitude of the United States will not change. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)

Washington: The White House and the State Department refused to comment last night on the "Monroe Doctrine" announced by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita in Tokyo yesterday. However, unofficial sources said that they believed the speech would be received coldly here. Sources here said that Washington officials would not make a formal response, as the speech was intended for the general public in Japan, not for representatives of foreign governments. Non-political figures believe that the wording of the speech is still relatively moderate. However, they see that from the broad tone, Japan reserves the necessary unlimited actions to be taken in the Far East. There is also a new discovery in this speech, namely that Japan includes the East Indies in its mission of stability. Sources here pointed out that the United States has huge commercial interests in the Dutch East Indies, which cannot be ignored. Non-political circles believe that Japan has no immediate intention of encroaching on American interests. However, once its own interests are violated under Arita's policy, the United States will inevitably be affected, either directly or indirectly. Semi-official sources deny that Arita's policy is similar to the Pan-American policy. They claim that the United States' policy towards the Western Hemisphere is to avoid interfering in the internal affairs of other American countries, while sharing responsibilities with all countries on the principle of equality, just as it previously took action in the Far East based on the Nine-Power Treaty.

Chongqing Provisional Assembly Issues Circular Telegram

Chongqing – The Chongqing Provisional Assembly has issued a circular telegram regarding the atrocities committed by Japanese aircraft. It states that the Japanese warlords, relying on their military force, have dispatched large numbers of air force units to attack our rear cities. In the past two months, Japanese aircraft have attacked Chongqing more than nineteen times, causing the tragic sacrifice of our innocent citizens. Cultural institutions, such as schools, newspapers, and churches, have been devastated. Foreign embassies, such as the British, Soviet, German, and French embassies and consulates, foreign news agencies, such as TASS, Reuter, and Havas, and the lives and properties of other foreign nationals have been systematically destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The aim of the Japanese is to destroy our will to resist and to threaten diplomatic officials of third countries and their nationals, preventing them from residing in China, thereby realizing the Japanese dream of dominating East Asia. We must solemnly declare to the Japanese warlords that this attempt will absolutely fail. The citizens of Chongqing are enraged by the cruel atrocities of Japanese aircraft. This kind of brutal bombing will only arouse historical hatred that we will never be able to resolve. Our 700,000 citizens of Chongqing have long been prepared to accept Japanese bombing with the most tragic and solemn spirit. We firmly believe that the Japanese warlords will sooner or later have to repay the blood debt they owe. We will each stand firm in our positions, do our best to support the government's policy of prolonged resistance until final victory. We hope that our compatriots throughout the country will strive to this end, and that international friends will take effective action to assist our country. (Dispatch of the 30th)

### French Army's Defeat Result of Strategic Errors; 900,000 Captured in Battles Within France

London – Professor Soulaire, Director of the French Academy, recently stated in London that he had asked General de Gaulle, head of the French National Committee in London, to explain the reasons for France's defeat. According to General de Gaulle, the French army was defeated without being able to fight. It is estimated that only 30,000 French soldiers were killed, with approximately 300,000 wounded. Initially, 350,000 French soldiers were captured within France, followed by an additional 600,000. In short, the French army did not fight. This was not due to a lack of courage and determination, but because the French command attempted to use the methods of 1914 to fight against the new German strategy of 1940. A major lesson from the fighting in France is that civilians should not interfere with military operations. If the British public obeys the instructions of the authorities, regardless of what they see or hear, and remain indoors, the actual losses of civilians will be minimal, and the damage caused by enemy mechanized equipment will not be so great.

### Japanese Army Plots to Spy on Vietnam; Japanese Warships Gathered on the Coast of Fangcheng; Cargo Transportation in Vietnamese Ports Suddenly Interrupted

Hong Kong Correspondence: It has recently been repeatedly reported here that Japan is taking advantage of the turbulent situation in Europe to plot to spy on Vietnam. This is supported by reports from southern Guangdong and the Shantou-Amoy region regarding the movements of Japanese troops, which are also highly credible. However, it is difficult to predict whether the Japanese will succeed in their scheme. It is reported that along the coast of the islands of Qiongyai and Runzhou, and in the Gulf of Tonkin, before late May, the Japanese fleet had only one aircraft carrier and over twenty warships of various sizes, all belonging to the 11th Fleet.

Sudden Increase in Japanese Warships

Since early June, the number of Japanese warships has increased dramatically, reaching over ninety. They are distributed from the waters off Fangcheng to the southeast of Qiongyai Island. All of Duzhouling, Nanrongling, Sanzhou Island, Dongluo Island, and Xigu Island have been occupied, and large quantities of military supplies have been transported and stored in the ports and bays of Yulin, Sanya, Qinglan, and Yangpu. At the same time, Japanese boats are conducting construction, dredging, and other work in these ports and bays. Submarines have entered Yulin Port. As for the Japanese troops gathered on Qiongyai Island, their numbers have also been increasing, reaching over 30,000. Apart from a small force dealing with the local Chinese guerrilla units, most are engaged in training in mountain climbing tactics and practicing balloon ascensions. The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, Nishio Toshizo, arrived in Qiongyai on the 11th to inspect and give instructions on important facilities such as the expansion of airfields, military ports, and warehouses. This clearly shows that they are using Qiongyai Island as a military base and implementing their southward policy with Vietnam as their target.

Attempt to Invade

On the 16th, Japanese warships off the coast of Fangcheng loaded Japanese soldiers and concentrated on Maiwei Island, attempting to directly invade Dongxing along the Jiangping Market. However, they were met with a calm and resolute defense by the Chinese troops stationed there, preventing the Japanese from succeeding. On the 17th, another Japanese warship sailed to Bailongwei, attacking the Chinese troops, but was again repelled. Dongxing and Bailongwei are both located very close to Vietnam. The Japanese actions undoubtedly threaten Vietnam. Therefore, the Vietnamese authorities are closely monitoring the situation. Vietnamese troops have also gathered in the border town of Jietie in preparation. Furthermore, the Japanese troops in Qincheng, who increased by over ten thousand a month ago and were originally preparing to attack eastwards, flanking the Chinese forces on the West River Line, have now been withdrawn to the islands of Qiongyai and Runzhou, also in preparation for spying on Vietnam.

Transportation Between Ports and Vietnam

Amidst the Japanese spying on Vietnam, the French government suddenly accepted the Japanese demand that Chinese and foreign goods not be transported through Haiphong and Hanoi. The Vietnamese authorities then decided to comply strictly from the 20th, which directly affected the transportation industry between Vietnamese and Hong Kong ports, causing it to come to a standstill. After the outbreak of the Guangdong-Guangxi war, the export routes for Chinese products such as tung oil, silk, and bristles were mostly through the Yunnan-Vietnam railway to Vietnam, then transferred to Hong Kong for centralized export. European and American goods and Hong Kong products were also mostly transported to the mainland via Hong Kong and Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam had become an important channel for the import and export of Chinese and foreign goods, and the volume of freight was very large. Due to the suspension of transportation, the losses to various transportation companies are very significant. Among them, goods worth over two million Hong Kong dollars are stockpiled in Hong Kong awaiting transportation to the mainland. Goods stored in Vietnam that cannot be transported to Hong Kong are also similarly affected. Furthermore, Hong Kong's required food supplies, such as livestock, rice, and stone, have also relied on supplies from Vietnam and Kangzhou Bay, which are now in danger of being interrupted, causing prices to rise. As for ships sailing from Hong Kong to Vietnam, those belonging to British merchants are still operating as usual, while those belonging to French merchants have been completely suspended since the 22nd, presumably due to compliance with Japanese demands on France. Passengers traveling to Vietnam on that day who had already boarded French merchant ships were temporarily transferred to British merchant ships. Therefore, while cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Vietnam has been suspended, passenger traffic can still continue, relying only on the limited connections of a few British merchant ships.

### Fierce Battles in Northern Guangdong: Chinese Troops Recapture Conghua, Japanese Troops Retreat to Xinjie

Hong Kong dispatch: The war in northern Guangdong Province, which had been dormant for a long time, continued until mid-May. The Japanese army then successively gathered troops stationed in the Huaxian and Conghua areas, hoping to invade the Bajiang River. From May 21st to 25th, fierce battles occurred at Fenghuo Ridge northwest of Liang Kou. Battles also occurred at Shiling, Zhizhai, Tianxin Village, Jingkou, and other places along the Bajiang River. On the 27th, the Japanese army again used twelve aircraft as cover to break through the Chinese army's Shijing position. However, after a counterattack by the Chinese army, they were repelled and a batch of Japanese soldiers were captured and sent to northern Guangdong for custody. Since the beginning of this month, the war in that area has become increasingly fierce. On the morning of the 5th, the Chinese army captured Heishan and Jiekou in separate attacks. The Japanese army rushed to reinforce them from Hemu Jing and Shendao, totaling more than 3,000 men. Their unit number was the Matsuo Regiment. They encountered the Chinese army at noon on the 7th, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties.

Recapture of Conghua: On the morning of the 8th, the Japanese army in various parts of Conghua increased to 4,000 men. Using aircraft and artillery cover, they launched a three-pronged counterattack against the Chinese army with fierce momentum. The Chinese army retreated slightly to the north along the entire front, but continued to fight a back-and-forth battle in the Jilonggang area. On the 9th, the Chinese army finally recovered Jilonggang. More than 500 Japanese corpses were found in the area south of Jilonggang, including three Japanese officers: Major Miyazawa, battalion commander, and Lieutenants Fujishima and Ito. Since then, the Chinese army has advanced rapidly towards Conghua County. On the 12th, the father (referring to a military leader) recaptured the county seat, taking advantage of the Japanese army's exhaustion, and attacked the outskirts of Guangzhou. However, the main forces of both sides are still in the Shendao and Taipingchang areas.

Recapture of Longkou

On the afternoon of the 7th, the Japanese army in Huaxian, with more than 500 men, advanced from Longkou towards Pingshan. A certain unit of the Chinese army retreated slightly, luring the Japanese army deep into the area north of Pingshan. The Japanese army fell into their trap. The Chinese army then used a surprise force to cut off their retreat. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, and the Chinese army recaptured Longkou, reaching Shijiao directly. On the 9th, the two armies charged and fought each other fiercely at Shijiao. The Japanese army was defeated and retreated to Xinjie Sanyangdian and other places. The Chinese army has brought the Xinjie area under control. On the evening of the 13th, a certain unit of the Chinese army again attacked Longxiang in two directions, attacking into the market from the northwest suburbs. They engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops in Renhe and Yahu heard the news and rushed to reinforce, but the Chinese soldiers were not discouraged and continued to attack. On the 14th, the two sides were still in a stalemate in the suburbs of Longxiang.

Unrest in Guangzhou

Since the Chinese army in northern Guangdong recaptured Conghua County, the outskirts of Guangzhou have been threatened. Therefore, the Japanese army has reinforced its troops in Xicun, Baiyun, Sanyuanli, Henan Baogang, Simintu Factory, and other places on the outskirts of the city.哨 Posts have also been added to all major intersections, and armored vehicles patrol all roads at night. After 7 pm every night, pedestrians are prohibited from traveling. Japanese military police and puppet police search all inns and hotels every night, and the situation is extremely serious.

### European Radio Broadcasting War

Germans broadcast to England five times more than the BBC's propaganda to Germany each day, but the English are on target every time. The fact that any German is willing to sacrifice to listen to English broadcasts shows the maturity of the anti-Nazi movement. Regardless of the severity of the penalties - those who listen to foreign broadcasts face years in prison, and repeat offenders can be sentenced to death - the German people are willing to endure it. They use one radio to broadcast German programs loudly, while another is hidden to secretly receive foreign radio broadcasts.

The British Broadcasting Corporation often stimulates the Germans by telling them that they cannot listen to foreign broadcasts. "Himmler (head of the German political police) tells you that listening to foreign broadcasts will damage your nerves. In fact, Germans, what he fears is not your nerves, but your thoughts. You are being deceived. We in England can listen to German broadcasts freely, even if the police are standing outside the window."

British broadcasts to Germany have always been factual, striving to win the trust of the Germans with accuracy. They often start by playing a few sad songs from German military music, and then read out the names of the German prisoners recently captured from the army, navy and air force. This is extremely attractive to listeners, because Germany never announces such news at home. A woman in East Prussia received official notification that her son had died in a submarine accident. A memorial service was held regularly in the village church. The British radio station broadcast the boy's name, saying that he was still alive. A grocery merchant in the town secretly told the boy's mother the good news. Four other friends of the woman also risked their lives to inform her of the same message. The memorial service was held as scheduled, but afterwards there was a private banquet.

Broadcasts about food shortages are most upsetting to housewives. Sometimes British broadcasters have a "housewives' program," and matter-of-factly give a cooking method, saying "four chicken eggs, a quarter of a pound of butter, and two tablespoons of sugar." German wives can't help but ask themselves. The British also often rebroadcast programs from the "Free Germany" radio station, which is located in Germany and transported from place to place by truck. Radio engineers say that such a station would require five or six trucks to transport the equipment, and most of these stations broadcast on the French border. No matter where it is located, the Germans always consider this a headache.

The situation of French broadcasts to Germany is similar to that of Britain - often quoting Hitler's speeches and adding annotations, attacking him even harder where he has broken his promises. A French broadcaster said: "Hitler insists that he wants to save Europe from communism, but now he has thrown himself into Stalin's arms. Listen to what he says on page 346 of 'Mein Kampf'." The German director of broadcasts to England is Jiaertanbai, an Iwowan, who participated in the European War in 1918. He went to Germany four years ago, married a German woman, and joined the German propaganda machine. His propaganda is nothing more than boasting about Germany's military power and trying to divide Britain and the United States, but its momentum is not particularly fierce. The Germans often use radio broadcasting internally as a tool to inspire the people, using every possible means to stimulate German hatred of England. When an accident occurs in Germany, there must always be the following words: "A suspect with a British accent was found at the scene. The police department is currently investigating." The Germans broadcast reports from the front line to the public every day. As soon as a German plane returns from reconnaissance on the front line, or flies back from bombing the enemy, it borrows a pocket-sized speaker to broadcast to the public. Submarine captains also stick their heads out of the command tower to describe the scene of enemy ships being sunk. Germans who have worked in journalism receive special training in Potsdam and then come out to organize German "propaganda companies" to engage in the various broadcasts mentioned above. Their programs are very rich, and German families flock to them.

What is strange is that although countries are engaged in their own propaganda, carrying out a radio broadcasting war, none of them interfere with the other's radio waves in the air, making it impossible to broadcast at all. Perhaps the result of disrupting radio waves will inevitably deepen hatred, and both sides believe that radio broadcasting is a powerful weapon for both attack and defense.

### Charity Basketball United Cup Yesterday's Game: Shanghai Qing Fought Hard to Defeat Qunyi; Qunyi Showed Strength and Led in the First Half, Shanghai Qing Took the Lead in the Last Ten Minutes

The United Cup Charity Basketball game was the second day yesterday. The two Group A2 games were tense throughout. In the first game between Shangxing and Zhongyi, Shangxing was initially at a disadvantage, but later took the lead with 14-9 in the first half, and then won 31-25. In the second game between Xihua and Tongren, the strength was slightly different. Qiu Xiaoci and Gao Zhaolong of Xihua scored 41 points in total, causing Tongren to be controlled throughout, and they lost miserably with 40-63. Xihua also led in the first half with 33-16. The final game between Qunyi and Shanghai Qing was tense every second. Under great threat, Shanghai Qing reversed the defeat in the last ten minutes. The United Cup trophy silver cups for the two groups are on display at the Xiexing Sports Equipment Company's business department at No. 1000 Edward Road starting yesterday. The battle between Shanghai Qing and Qunyi is as follows:

Qunyi Takes the Lead

Qunyi is a transformed version of Xufang. Shen Yugong, Chen Xuechong, Ren Xiangcheng and others, who were pillars of the former Hualian team, have all joined Shanghai Qing. Yesterday, Qunyi continued Xufang's style and momentum was undiminished. Tao Shaosheng opened the scoring first. Before long, He Xiaoguang hit the bullseye. Shanghai Qing buried itself in hard work. Li Zude and Shen Yugong each scored 4 points, and then each scored 6 points. Qunyi, seeing the urgent situation, transferred Yan Yong and brought in Qiao Liulang, and the momentum greatly increased. Tao Shaosheng and Zou Zichen hit every shot, and the momentum increased by seven points in one breath, creating the most excellent situation of 15-7, 18-10, and 20-12. This was Qunyi's golden age. After that, the two sides were evenly matched, and Qunyi was always in the leading position. Da Mao on Shanghai Qing's side withdrew once and re-entered, but failed to break through Qunyi's fire net. 32-29, Shanghai Qing was at a disadvantage in the first half.

Shanghai Qing Turns the Tide

After the change of baskets, Qunyi's momentum continued to rise. He Xiaoguang fired like a machine gun, hitting the bullseye. Yu Dehai and Shen Yugong scored two consecutive points, still maintaining a balance. When Shen Yugong scored a point, chasing the score to a close situation of 36-37, Chen Xuechong was sent off for four fouls, and the audience was worried for Shanghai Qing. Unexpectedly, after Li Zude was transferred to the court, he immediately scored a basket, creating the third chance for Shanghai Qing to take the lead. However, Qunyi immediately chased to a tie, from 39 each to 40 each. The balance between the two sides was not broken. Unfortunately, Qunyi's stamina was insufficient, while Shanghai Qing became more and more brave. Da Mao and Yu Dehai scored nine points in a row, allowing Shanghai Qing to escape the dangerous situation and reach 48-40. In the last seven minutes, Tao Shaosheng was sent off for four fouls, giving Qunyi an even greater blow. Shanghai Qing finally reversed the defeat with 56-48.

### The Eastern Football Team's Great Victory Over the Malaysian Chinese Combined Team in Singapore

Four to One – Charity Match

(Singapore Dispatch) The Hong Kong Eastern Football Team played a charity match against the Malaysian Chinese Combined Team at the Anson Road Stadium here on the 14th. Eastern won with a score of four to one. The proceeds from ticket sales were entirely donated to the British War Relief Fund. Due to inclement weather, the audience was small. In the first half, Eastern led two to one, with Hou Chengtuo and Li Deqi each scoring a goal. Tai Sheng, the center forward of the Malaysian Chinese team, seized the opportunity of a penalty kick and broke the egg. In the second half, the Malaysian Chinese Combined Team only had ten players on the field, making offense and defense difficult. Eastern took the opportunity to advance, with Li Deqi and Xu Jingcheng successively scoring goals, ending the game with a score of four to one.

### Increased Levies in the Two French Concessions Today Make Life in Shanghai More Difficult, Inevitably Affecting Commodity Prices and Rents. The French Concession Taxpayers' Association Asks for Reconsideration.

The Public Concession Bureau of Works is increasing levies by 50%, meaning that house taxes, land taxes, license fees, and all other payable fees will be subject to an additional surcharge of 50%. The French Concession Board of Directors is increasing levies, with the land tax surcharge increasing from one per thousand to three per thousand, and the house tax surcharge increasing from two percent to seven percent. The surcharges on other certificate taxes and miscellaneous taxes are all increasing from ten percent to fifty percent. The above-mentioned increased levies in both concessions will be implemented as scheduled from today. The burden on taxpayers in both concessions will inevitably increase, and the possible consequences will be to stimulate commodity prices and fuel rent increase disputes.

A Letter Asking the French Authorities to Reconsider

The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, regarding the increase in levies, wrote to the Board of Directors, but the Board of Directors rejected the request in its reply. Yesterday, they sent another letter to the Board of Directors to argue on principle, asking the Superintendent of the Board, Mr. Bietry, and the Director-General, Mr. Teghidi, to reconsider. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, we have received your letter of June 28th and are fully aware of its contents. Regarding the upcoming increase in levy rates, our association has already thoroughly discussed it and has not mentioned a 40% increase in levies. It only stated that the increase rate for various taxes is as high as 40%, such as vehicle licenses. Our association needs to clarify this point. After the outbreak of the war in 1937, the number of residents in the French Concession suddenly increased,

The City Scene is Flourishing

Although your board's various expenditures and operating expenses have increased, empty houses that were previously unoccupied have been swept away, and the construction of houses on vacant land has sprung up like mushrooms. The income from house taxes has also increased accordingly. Therefore, although your board's expenditures have increased, its income has also increased. However, please examine the number of residents in the French Concession after 1939, which has shown a gradual decline. The reasons are nothing more than high commodity prices and difficult living conditions, and the indirect reason is the large amount of taxes levied by your board, which also has a

Significant Relationship

Because the surcharges on various taxes after the war are quite large. The rise and fall of any region is based on the increase or decrease of residents. If your board intends to maintain the current prosperity, it should not reduce the number of residents. Therefore, the increase in taxes is a serious blow. As for the economic foundation of your board,

Always Solid

According to economic principles, we should live within our means and balance income and expenditure. Therefore, each fiscal budget is necessary, but we dare to ask your board not to be too meticulous about this, because according to previous financial statements, there is a surplus every year, and this surplus can also make up for the deficit. Moreover, the recent withdrawal of the French Concession refugee area police force can save a lot of expenses. In short, the people are the most important, and the country is second. The prosperity and decline of the entire region are closely related to the safety and security of the people's livelihood and are in the hands of the administrators of this region. They are interdependent, interrelated, and mutually dependent. Therefore, regarding the issue of this increase in levies, we ask your board to reconsider it, and if it can be suspended, or the increase rate reduced, or the implementation postponed, the millions of residents of our French Concession will be extremely anxious and hopeful. We hereby send this letter and ask for your review and reply." This is addressed to the French Concession Board of Directors.

### Shanghai Raises Money for Winter Clothing Allowances

The Solicitation of慰勞金 (consolation money) 代金 Committee, hosted by a certain group in this city, has already begun to prepare for the Shanghai winter clothing allowance campaign in advance, as instructed. The dates and solicitation regulations are generally in accordance with the National Winter Clothing Solicitation Association. For the sake of unified centralization, this city's winter clothing allowance solicitation this year will be promoted by the Solicitation慰勞金 代金 Campaign Committee. It is heard that the Solicitation Association is preparing, and its solicitation regulations will be announced soon. The association will provide receipt books, bank remittance slips, and donation reporting forms to various industry groups, schools, and institutions before the solicitation date, so that all sectors can carry out the solicitation. The funds raised will be collected and remitted to the National Bank by the presiding groups to express the respect of the Shanghai people and to fulfill the inherent mission of the people. It is said that the Solicitation Association has sent a telegram to the Chongqing Winter Clothing Solicitation Association to acknowledge the amount and respond.

### It Was Reported Yesterday That the Iron Gate of the Sixteenth Wharf Would Be Open All Day

The iron gate connecting the French Concession and the Nanshi area has seen few residents entering and exiting since it was opened on the 28th of last month. Yesterday, it was reported that the iron gate would be open all day starting today. The previous opening hours, which were only limited to 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM, were said to be a trial run.

### Inheritance Tax Will Be Levied Today, Handled Concurrently by the Direct Tax Office. The Shanghai Concession Area is No Exception.

Property Value

After the Ministry of Finance established the Direct Tax Office, it will implement the levying of inheritance tax starting today. Provisional regulations and implementation rules have been promulgated one after another, stipulating that anyone who leaves property in the territory of the Republic of China at the time of death shall pay inheritance tax according to law. Citizens of the Republic of China who have a residence in the country and have property abroad shall also be taxed. Inheritance is the movable and immovable property of the deceased, as well as all other rights to it. Inheritance tax is calculated and levied based on the amount of inheritance, and the heirs and legatees are the taxpayers. Inheritances with a total value of less than 5,000 yuan, as well as property donated to the government, property donated to educational, cultural, charitable, and public welfare undertakings, and property not exceeding 500,000 yuan, are exempt from inheritance tax. If the land in the inheritance is continuously cultivated by the heir, the amount of inheritance tax to be borne by the land portion shall be

Halved

Inheritances with a total value of more than 5,000 yuan shall be subject to a tax of 1%. Those exceeding 50,000 yuan shall be subject to an additional tax calculated by grade on the amount exceeding it. Those who fail to report the fact of death or submit an inventory of inheritance may be fined up to 50 yuan. Those who intend to reduce or exempt tax amounts and conceal inheritance shall be subject to a fine of one to three times the amount of tax concealed in addition to the supplementary tax amount. Today, the people of the country regard this tax as China's only good direct tax,

Unanimously Support

And comply with it, and the Shanghai Concession area is no exception. Furthermore, the excess profits tax has been levied since January 1st of last year, and the rumor that it will be implemented at the same time as the inheritance tax is inaccurate.

### National Day Celebrations in the United States and Canada: Celebration Programs. Today is Canada's Restoration of National Sovereignty Memorial Day. The Fourth is the United States Independence Day.

The fourth of this month is the 151st anniversary of American independence. The American侨 in Shanghai will, as usual, hold enthusiastic celebrations on this day. The U.S. Navy's 4th Regiment in Shanghai is scheduled to hold a flag-raising ceremony at 8:30 AM on this morning, presided over by Colonel Baker at the Columbia Country Club on Great Western Road, and hold a review. U.S. Acting Consul Baker, Justice Hemmerich, and Mr. Macronlai will all attend and participate. The flag-raising ceremony will take about three quarters of an hour. The American Club will host guests from 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, the 4th Regiment will perform a baseball game at the racecourse, inviting Mr. Hongbai, the commander of the International Volunteer Corps, as the referee, and Mr. Fankeling, the former Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau, and Mr. Aleman, the current director of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau, as the line judges. At 9:00 PM in the evening, a "July 4th" dinner party will be held at the Columbia Country Club.

Today is the 73rd anniversary of Canada's restoration of national sovereignty. The Canadian僑 and club members in this city are scheduled to hold a dinner party at the Royal Air Force Association clubhouse in the HSBC Building tonight to celebrate. According to a New Sound News reporter, the association has sent invitations to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China.

U.S. Acting Consul General in Shanghai, Baker, British Consul General in Shanghai, Sir George, and senior British and American naval and land officers in Shanghai will attend to extend their congratulations. At a time when the whole country is rising up to assist Britain in the war, the commemoration is all the more meaningful. According to the 1st of July 1867, the territories of the British North American Federation were restored to the Canadian territory.

### Vietnam Detains Indigo Blue Cloth, Consulting on the Situation. The French Embassy in Chongqing Has Sent a Telegram to Shanghai.

Since the Vietnamese government implemented the detention of domestically produced indigo blue cloth shipped to the mainland by various manufacturers in this city via transit through that place, the merchants of this city once stated that although the indigo blue trademark was registered in Germany, the raw materials of the cloth were purely domestically produced, spun, woven, and dyed. Now that it has been detained suddenly, it is obviously due to a misunderstanding. Therefore, they telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make representations to the French Embassy in China and explain everything. On the local side, they wrote to the French Consul General in Shanghai, requesting that he release the detained cloth as soon as possible in accordance with the instructions of the Vietnamese government in order to maintain the established good relations between the two countries and facilitate commercial transportation. It is heard that the French Embassy in Chongqing has sent a telegram to Shanghai, instructing the consulate to convene relevant parties to engage in consultations in order to handle the matter accordingly. After receiving this telegram, the French Consulate General in Shanghai has formally notified the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, instructing the industry association to promptly send representatives of the member manufacturers who have been detained to the consulate along with representatives of the Chamber of Commerce to await consultation. It is heard that the representatives have been appointed by the industry.

### The Transfer of Documents to the French is Groundless. The Chinese Side Lodges a Serious Protest. It is Legal to Return Them to the Chinese Government. The British and American Authorities Should Consider Carefully.

After the Shanghai Municipal Government deposited the Land Bureau documents with the Bureau of Works, the pseudo "Municipal Government" repeatedly requested them from the Bureau of Works. This issue was considered by the Bureau of Works and the Consular Body. According to a Pirmins News reporter, some opinions within the Consular Body seemed to favor the pseudo government's request for the deposited documents. However, the Chinese side unanimously opposed it and has lodged protests with the British and American authorities, urging them to pay attention. The legal basis for this case is that the pseudo organization has not been recognized by any country, so it cannot be handed over rashly. Moreover, these documents were entrusted to it for safekeeping by the Chinese government and should be returned to the Chinese government in the future, which is legal. The British and American authorities are now reconsidering it carefully.

Serious Breach of Faith is No Different from Surrender

The宇林西報 (North China Daily News) carried a letter from a reader, Mr. Sun, stating that your newspaper recently published an editorial entitled "An Important Issue," which advocated that the Chinese Land Bureau archives, which Mayor Yu Hongjun had previously deposited with the Bureau of Works, be transferred to Fu Xiao'an. After reading it,

I am deeply shocked

The editorial said, "In the past year and three seasons, the degree of improvement in the situation has reached the point where it is irrefutable and it can be safely said that the situation has returned to normal in expectations." I wonder if other Chinese and foreign people hold this view. The Bureau of Works accepted the documents on behalf of the Chinese government and

Kept them safe

If these documents are handed over to any party other than the legitimate Chinese government, it would be a serious breach of faith. The British people strongly criticized the surrender of the British allies, which would greatly affect British interests. If the Bureau of Works handed over the documents to Fu Xiao'an, it would be no different from a small-scale surrender, but its meanness would be no different from surrender. At this time, it is not only the Chinese people who hope that their British friends have learned the painful lesson that compromise is useless.

### Chinese Mobile Troops Have Reached Kunshan. Around 1:00 PM the Day Before Yesterday, the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Was Interrupted.

The Chinese mobile troops led by 禰 are very active along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway line. In addition to attacking Danyang Station and blowing up a Japanese military vehicle a few days ago, according to passengers on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 29th), the railway tracks on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway near Wuxi were again dug up in many sections by Chinese mobile troops, causing traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway to be interrupted again. However, the details are unknown because passengers were unable to inquire. After the Japanese side repaired it, it was able to pass. It is also learned that the Chinese mobile troops have gradually extended to the suburbs of Shanghai, and their vanguard troops have reportedly crossed the Qingyang Port and reached the Kunshan area.

### The Closure of the Nanshi Refugee Area Leaves a Deep Impression

The procedures for disbanding the Nanshi Refugee Area have been completed. The disbursement of relief grain for the 19,000 people in the area was completed yesterday. The General Office of the Supervisory Committee of the area also announced its dissolution with the end of the area affairs. Except for the two hospitals and the Xin Pu Yu Tang in the area, which will be temporarily maintained by the Rehabilitation Committee, all 88 shelters were declared closed yesterday. The refugees in the area usually received grain rations from the area office according to the number of people, with each person receiving half a pound of rice per day. Because most of them were engaged in peddling and working, they were able to make a living. Now that they have suddenly lost their relief grain, the future is difficult. At the same time, there are also problems with their residences, because the private owners of the shelter houses will take the opportunity to close the refugee area and take them back. The Nanshi Refugee Area was established during the most tense time of the Battle of Shanghai on August 13th. At that time, the war zone in the suburbs of Shanghai was full of refugees. Without the establishment of this area, the suffering of the people would have been even more tragic. The official establishment date of the area was November 11th, 1937, and it was declared closed yesterday (June 30th) due to the departure of the Father, lasting two years, seven months, and nineteen days, leaving a deep impression on people.

### French僑 Receive Slogan Letters, Filled with Grief and Indignation. Old Travels Have Become a Thing of the Past. How Can They Relieve Sorrow and Boredom?

The French-language Shanghai Daily News said that the French侨 in this city received letters from France at the end of May the day before yesterday. Their envelopes were all stamped with slogan propaganda, including slogans such as "Victory is still after long-term patience" and "The old houses and museums of a certain city (now occupied) are worth visiting." The French侨, after receiving the letters, sighed at the past and present, all filled with grief and indignation, because things have changed, and in no time, they have become a thing of the past, which makes people linger even more. According to the French newspaper, the French侨 in this city now only have to work hard to revitalize the morale of the people, because although work is not enough to forget worries, it can also relax the tense nerves slightly and give the broken heart something to rely on, so as not to hurt the spirit. The newspaper believes that any work should be beneficial to the public and provide comfort to itself.

### The Grain Industry Conference Ends, Forming an Evaluation Committee

The Shanghai Soy and Rice Industry Association, together with the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association, consulted the day before yesterday on concrete measures to stabilize the rice market. After discussion, in accordance with the wishes of the authorities, they organized the Shanghai Rice Industry Group Food Evaluation Committee to be responsible for handling rice price evaluation matters. Now, the association has appointed Zhu Youzhang, Cao Xinggeng, and Yan Xiaoquan to visit the authorities again at 10:00 AM today to report on the deliberations of the industry and the need to organize a food evaluation committee at present. If the consent of the authorities is obtained, they will proceed with the matter, and it is expected that the authorities will urge its realization. The Hong Kong authorities have banned ship exports to disperse the population, but have not banned rice exports, so rice-laden ships may set sail to Shanghai in the coming days. It is also learned that 1,600 tons of rice were loaded in Hong Kong a few days ago and originally intended to be shipped to Shanghai for the market, but it was decided to transfer it to Ningbo midway, and a large quantity will arrive in early July, numbering more than 130,000 bags.

### Five Religions Lectures, Yesterday's Lecture on the Essentials of Christianity

Yesterday (June 30th) was the second day of the five religions lectures held in commemoration of Mr. Feng Bingnan's mother's birthday. The lecture was on the essentials of Christianity in three parts, and the speaker was the famous Christian scholar Mr. Xu Songshi. On this day, the audience was still very enthusiastic, including both Christians and non-Christians. Mr. Xu had a deep understanding of Christian doctrine and expounded it very clearly. His views on the relationship between doctrine and filial piety were very insightful, and he also cited many examples of Confucius's thought, which showed that the purpose of religion was originally consistent. He said that Christianity emphasizes practice rather than theory, which is particularly able to extract the spirit of the church's founding and is thought-provoking. The joke about the confused worm at the end made the audience laugh. Therefore, the audience was full of energy from beginning to end. The broadcasting equipment was improved on this day, so the sound was clearer than the first day. Several fans were added in the hall, so the cool breeze was blowing. Today is the third day of the lecture, and the lecture will be on the essentials of Taoism and morality. Public lectures on Taoism are very rare, and it is expected that the audience will be even more enthusiastic. A book of Ancient Mirrors of Moral Education and Taoism introduction gift coupons will also be distributed on the spot, but it is a valuable crop.

### Jews in Shanghai

— A Quan

If we occasionally step into the area north of the Suzhou River, turning from Beisichuan Road, 横浜桥(Yokohama Bridge) to the Zhoushan Road and Broadway Road area of the Huishan Police Station...for a round-trip tour, we will at least discover many lost sheep-like –Jews.

Since Germany ordered the expulsion of Jews a year ago, Jews have suddenly become "survivors of the tiger's mouth"; it makes them deeply feel that the vast earth has long been without a foothold for the exiled! Alas! May I ask, what path is left for the lambs whose lairs have been destroyed and are bewildered? Finally, they could not escape the butcher's bloody hands, and they were forced to this corner of the world, a Shanghai they never dreamed of.

For Jews in Shanghai, it can be said that the Hongkou area is the only lair for this group of lambs, right? All the houses in that area that were left empty after the war are filled with them!

Jews have always been known to the world for their "unique business acumen." When it comes to making a tenth of the profit, their methods are particularly "sharp." Therefore, some people describe their "business talent" as "calculating abacus" or "mercury on the ground"; it means that they "take advantage of every opportunity" and "leave no hole unfilled"; this saying is very subtle! Since the Jews came to Shanghai not long ago – even before Hongkou was opened – many Jews had already gathered in Hongkou to develop their "independent" or "group" economic network-style shops. What coffee shops, department stores, small dance halls, cinemas, barber shops, customs brokers, and even Jewish churches...are all opening up one after another! "Jews are cunning foxes," someone else said: "They always take the small opportunities in everything to easily take advantage of others; for example, if you accidentally borrow a match from a Jew to light a cigarette, he will also ask you for a cigarette in return for the match."

Jews do business, not only satisfied with simply attracting customers at the storefront; they also personally go to the offices of nearby foreign companies with many daily necessities to implement the "soliciting" doctrine, which is a bit mysterious, even barbers are asked for advice!

Jews in Shanghai seem to be living on the surface: but their inner worries and spiritual pain, I think, are too pitiful! If you don't believe me, let the author give two examples:

Although this happened last year, it still remains deeply in my mind. Once: when the × country's cruise ship arrived in Shanghai – it was during the period when Jews were exiled to Shanghai – thousands of Jewish refugees were载(carried) to this isolated island, supporting the old and carrying the young, very chaotic; seeing this "lamb wandering picture" involuntarily teaches you to feel the pain of "the country is broken and the family is destroyed." A Jew happened to come to my company to write借用(borrow) a phone, and he said to me in not very pure English: "Sir! Isn't it very interesting? This is all the family property I was lucky enough to bring from Germany!" As he spoke, he pointed to a small handheld leather夹(folder) with a bitter smile. He didn't cry, maybe he was still a philosopher? Cherishing the tears that are not easily shed, to cope with the more painful environment on the future lifeline!

Another time: the × country's cruise ship, in the pouring rain,又载(carried) the second batch of pitiful exiles. (Of course, they were Jewish refugees) But, outside the iron gate of the pier, there were many Jews who were 槟弃(rejected) outside the gate by the × country's customs officers, and no one was allowed to run in, although they all had sufficient reasons; they were only allowed to sigh at the ocean and be soaked in the pouring rain倒(Instead) Very coincidentally, a pair of洋狗(foreign dogs) were not stopped by the customs officers and were able to swagger越(past)进(and into) the iron fence. I witnessed this scene and was moved by emotion, and a feeling of sadness arose: "Alas! The pain of losing a country is worse than being a dog!"

### Hong Kong Tense: Chinese Residents Flee, Heading to Southwest and Manila, etc. Ships Leaving Hong Kong for Shanghai are Fully Loaded

Since Hong Kong declared martial law due to threats, the situation has become extremely tense. The local government has ordered the evacuation of British women, children, and expatriates, to be completed by the 5th of this month. At the same time, it has convened overseas Chinese leaders to plan the evacuation. According to telegrams received by the shipping industry yesterday, Chinese residents in Hong Kong, feeling uneasy due to the tense situation, have been moving away from Hong Kong in droves in recent days. Currently, tickets for all ships leaving Hong Kong for Shanghai have been snapped up. However, most are taking advantage of the uninterrupted transportation between Hong Kong and Vietnam to evacuate with their families, heading to the southwestern provinces. Currently, in addition to regular ships and those calling at bays, the Hong Kong-Vietnam routes are served by the Guanghai and Haitan ships of Guangdong, which make special trips. Although the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has not been interrupted, the evacuation of Chinese from Vietnam and Hong Kong and the urgent transport of accumulated goods have caused congestion. It is also learned that the President Coolidge of the United States President Lines was diverted to transport foreign women and children to Manila after returning to Hong Kong from Shanghai last week. Therefore, its originally scheduled return to Shanghai on the 9th of this month will be delayed for several days.

Dutch East Indies: Defense

The defense of the Dutch East Indies is now also very comprehensive. Currently, there are four infantry regiments and two independent battalions, as well as a tank corps, coastal defense force, and anti-aircraft artillery force. The naval strength includes two light cruisers, eight destroyers, twelve submarines, two gunboats, five mine-laying ships, and eight mine-sweeping ships. In addition, a naval air base has been established in Amboyna, West Ceram Island, making its strength extremely formidable.

British Commentary

Mr. Woodhead, a well-known British commentator in this city, published an article in yesterday's English "North China Daily News" weekly, commenting on the current tense relations between Britain and Japan. The article began by saying, "We can assume that the British government's warning to women and children in Hong Kong to prepare for evacuation is clearly due to the recent hostile actions taken by the Japanese army. Since landing near Kowloon, the Japanese army has completed the encirclement of the Kowloon border and implemented a blockade of Hong Kong. This action attempts to coerce the British government to stop using Hong Kong and the Burma Road to transport 'munitions' into mainland China."

"Legally speaking, the Japanese government has no right to make this request. According to the Japanese side, 'they are not at war with the Chinese National Government,' so Japan's request to enjoy belligerent rights is purely an overreach. The Japanese can certainly use force to prohibit goods from entering the mainland from occupied areas, but they have no reason to interfere with Hong Kong's trade and the transportation on the Burma Road. The Hong Kong government has formally denied that munitions are transported from Hong Kong to the mainland. Hong Kong is purely a distribution center, and in law and morality, it has no right to prevent the transportation of goods from all neutral countries to China. If the British government prohibits American trucks or gasoline from transiting Hong Kong to China, then the American authorities would naturally be angered at Britain. As for the Burma Road, it can only transport a few hundred tons into Yunnan each month. It is doubtful whether the road is capable of transporting artillery, tanks, and aircraft engines. At the same time, the road mainly serves as an export route. Britain and the United States need various local products from mainland China, and they have no choice but to rely on the road's transportation capacity to obtain them, even if they pay high freight rates." The article concluded by saying that the Hong Kong authorities' notification to women and children to evacuate shows that the British government is unwilling to accept the Japanese military's demands. It remains to be seen whether the United States will give Britain active and moral support, but in any case, the United States believes that if Britain allows the road to be blocked, it would be tantamount to selling out the Chinese government. Mr. Woodhead hopes that the British and Japanese authorities will not break down over this issue, but if the Japanese side is completely stubborn, a breakdown may be inevitable.

Hong Kong: Rumors Abound

According to people from Hong Kong, the tension in Hong Kong in recent days has been unprecedented. At the same time, rumors abound, and people are panicking. As a result, countless people are going to Macau, Manila, and the mainland. A few days ago, when a famous actor Xue Juexian was performing his masterpiece at a theater, it was suddenly rumored that a certain army had broken into the British territory of Kowloon and that war had begun. The audience was shocked and fled in panic, causing chaos. Later, it was learned that it was a rumor, but everyone had been thoroughly frightened. Another piece of news said that a certain group of ronin had hidden a large number of weapons in cabbages and smuggled them into Hong Kong. At first, customs officers did not notice, but then a customs officer casually picked up a cabbage and felt that it weighed more than usual. When he opened it, he found a pistol and bullets hidden inside. As a result, a large search was carried out, and the truth was revealed. Everyone believed that a certain group was planning to launch an attack inside and outside Hong Kong, with some kind of plot. The Hong Kong authorities, believing that this news should not be spread, immediately issued an order prohibiting newspapers from publishing it. Later, it was revealed by customs officers, and it became known to the public. Currently, local cultural figures are moving to the mainland and Macau in droves.

### Feng Bingnan's Commemorative Words for His Mother's Birthday (4): Advocating Simple Moral Standards to the Utmost, Holding Three Major Events to Commemorate His Mother's Birthday

I dare not claim to be able to fully practice filial piety, but I deeply know that filial piety is the foundation of being a person, and I have never dared to neglect it. Now that my mother's seventieth birthday is approaching, I do not want to hold a celebration in the worldly, luxurious, and fleeting manner, but I want to use a more lasting method that benefits people's minds and bodies to commemorate it. I believe that a person's mind and body are equally important. The body should be healthy, and the health of the mind should be equally emphasized. Physical health can be obtained through science, but mental health is beyond the reach of science. Even physical health sometimes cannot be achieved by science, so in addition to scientific treatment, many human diseases need to be treated with spirit. The world only sees the tangible and dazzling effects of science, and the accurate signs that can be traced, and thinks that science is omnipotent. Although science has its abilities, it is not omnipotent. The world often thinks that science can create, but in fact, science has no creative ability, it only explains, combines, or improves existing things, and cannot be said to create. Strictly speaking, human beings do not have the ability to create. For example, radio can transmit sound across thousands of miles of space, and people may think that this is the achievement of human creation, but in fact it is only the use of the inherent "ether" in the universe, plus the combination of some inherent materials. If science develops alone, and morality does not keep pace with it, then science will not only not benefit mankind, but will harm mankind. We can see what kind of effect science without moral support will produce by looking at the two World Wars in Europe, so morality and science should be used in conjunction with each other, and neither should be lacking. Science is the method of exploring the truth of things, while morality is the method of exploring the truth of being a person. If the truth of being a person has not been obtained, then what is the use of the truth of things to us? If morality and science can cooperate, then mankind will advance to civilization day by day. If morality and science are separated, then no matter how perfect science progresses, it will only accelerate the degradation of mankind. The world can survive without science, but it cannot survive without morality. Modern people admire science very much, which is not surprising in our country, which is backward in science, but they seem to neglect the issue of morality too much. Since morality is so important to mankind, we should actively promote it and never allow it to degenerate. Therefore, I believe that the first thing to do to improve society is to express the conditions of morality in the simplest way, so that everyone can know and practice them. So that everyone's behavior has something to rely on and something to admire. Some people also say that the world is still about power now, and you are still talking about morality, isn't it out of touch with the times? I don't think so, because the more immoral and barbaric the world is, the more we should talk about morality. We cannot stop promoting it just because some people don't want to listen. At the same time, we should think of various ways to influence everyone to listen. I have thought carefully, there are only five attitudes to being a person in the world: (1) benefiting others and oneself, (2) benefiting others without harming oneself, (3) benefiting others at the expense of oneself, (4) harming others to benefit oneself, (5) harming others without benefiting oneself. The first one is the most reasonable, the second one can also be done, the third one cannot be done by ordinary people, the fourth one is unacceptable, and the fifth one is even more unacceptable. The so-called simple moral standards and methods are to teach people how to achieve the most reasonable attitude mentioned above, that is, how to benefit others and oneself.

To commemorate my mother's birthday this time, in order to make it more meaningful and more beneficial to society and the public, I am holding the following three events.

The first thing is to first invite famous Confucian scholars to extract the essence of the Five Teachings that are related to the morality of being a person and give a comprehensive and simple lecture. On the one hand, I will hire a versatile person to compile the integration of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam. I believe that all sciences can be standardized, have laws, have a certain program, and have the arguments of things, while morality has never been so concrete. In theory and method, it has always been chaotic and without standards, and there are often disputes and no agreement. Even those who are determined to rely on morality are slow to see results, not as fast and easy to see as science. Therefore, I feel that morality also needs a definite standard process to teach people how to get started. Although the objects of worship of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam are different, and the rituals used are different, their purpose is always to persuade people to do good and eliminate evil. If everyone can understand the true meaning of religion and everyone can practice the true meaning of religion, then it will not be difficult for the whole world to achieve perfection. However, the doctrines of the Five Teachings are profound and meaningful, and not everyone can understand their mysteries, but there are also many that are easy to understand and easy to practice, which can be used as an introductory method to the morality of being a person. This book has been being compiled for quite some time, with each teaching being a book, and it will be printed and published soon.

The second thing is to translate the five famous works of the British Confucian scholar Samuel Smiles: "Self-Help," "Character," "Duty," "Thrift," and "Life and Labour," to supplement the inadequacy of the "Integration of the Five Teachings." These books explain the principles of self-cultivation, career establishment, dealing with the world, and being a person very clearly, and there are many examples, which are most likely to inspire people. Europe has these immortal masterpieces that can benefit the world and people, but unfortunately they will not study them and use them, and only know how to focus on material science, resulting in an unprecedented disaster, which is so painful! I have always admired these books the most in my life and have benefited the most from them, so I specially introduce them to the society. What the "Introduction to the Five Teachings" has not covered can be found in these books. I have already started translating, but the work is very tedious, and I hope it can be completed within one or two years.

### Female Nurse Dies: Autopsy Completed

Li Yuying, also known as Li Jieru, a female head nurse from Fujian at the Sino-Western Nursing School on Route Paul Henry, suddenly died in her bedroom at the hospital on the night of the 11th of this month. The person in charge of the hospital did not report it to the police station, but instead signed a certificate of death due to a stroke and sent the body to the Chinese Funeral Home for encoffining. When the body was about to be buried in the Hongqiao Cemetery, a letter was sent to the French police station. The police station suspended the coffin and sent it to the autopsy office. The hospital's business manager, Mu Zhenqing, doctor Lin Zhengliang, and the deceased's parents were summoned to the case. The Second Special District Court was requested to send someone to open the coffin and dissect the body. The stomach was removed, and undigested rice, food, and vegetables were taken to the hospital for analysis and verification. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. After the body was stitched up, it was re-encoffined and temporarily stored in the autopsy office. It was not until yesterday that the Chinese Funeral Home transported the coffin back to the funeral home, preparing for a scheduled burial.

### Unable to Endure Abuse: Husband and Wife Sue

Luo Zengshan, a 26-year-old man from Shanyin, Shaoxing, living at No. 54, Daodeli, Route de Bayle, is the elder brother of Luo Guifang, a dancer at the Hongxing Dance Hall in Hong Kong. Recently, his wife Xu Aizhen (18 years old, living at No. 13, Wenanfang, Route de Bayle) hired a lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting mediation for divorce due to unbearable abuse. According to the petition, the court summoned both parties for mediation in the Civil Court Four Division on the morning of the day before yesterday. First, the petitioner's lawyer stated the previous situation, and then the opposing party also appointed a lawyer to appear on his behalf and opposed the divorce. After verifying the situation in court, because both parties had no sincerity in reconciliation, the mediation was declared unsuccessful, and the petitioner was ordered to file a formal lawsuit.

A woman named Hua Chen Ruying of No. 30, Jianzhongli, Route Victor Emmanuel III, recently commissioned lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against her husband, Hua Yimei, alleging abandonment, difficult living conditions, requesting a judgment ordering cohabitation, payment of living expenses of 40 yuan per month, surrender of the girl, and exercise of guardianship. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Judge Ma Yishu opened the Civil Court Seven Division to summon both parties for trial. The plaintiff's lawyer represented and stated the details of the case. The defendant commissioned lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yang Yunshi to represent and defend, requesting the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit and stating their reasons. After verifying the situation in court, the court instructed the parties to postpone the hearing and try to reconcile outside the court.

### Yuande Bank Accused: Sued for Bill Payment

The Defendant Seeks to Resolve the Situation, Requests Postponement Unapproved

Today is the last day of the first half of the year's business for the financial industry. Although it is Sunday, Chinese and foreign banks are closed as usual, but money shops are still busy closing their accounts. Fortunately, the financial market has been relatively stable recently, and there have been no drastic changes as at the end of April, so no accidents have occurred. During the end of April, many money shops that also engaged in speculative businesses were quite affected, but they were able to tide over the difficulties safely because their weaknesses were never exposed. However, Yuande Money Shop at No. 205 Beijing Road was in a very precarious situation at the time, so it successively issued cashier's checks to exchange for a large amount of cash to raise funds for turnover and seek to make up for the losses. However, due to insufficient strength, all of the checks were dishonored upon maturity. The holders of the checks rose up in protest, but the manager of the shop, Huang Aitang, was unable to cope. At first, he wanted to ignore the debts. It was not until Zhu Baolin, one of the holders of the checks, first filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, and other creditors followed suit, that he realized that the situation was gradually becoming tense and difficult to shirk. He urgently requested the other creditors to postpone the recovery, and at the same time convened a creditors' meeting to discuss a proper solution, so as to enable the shop to continue its business, which is also to protect the interests of all creditors. After both parties decided, Huang commissioned an accountant to review all of Yuande's

accounts first. As for how to pay off the debts, there is no concrete decision yet. The case previously filed by Zhu Baolin was due to be heard yesterday. The defendant Yuande Shop and its manager Huang Aitang jointly appointed a lawyer to appear in court and admitted that the amount of the bill claimed by Zhu was correct. However, the defendant requested an extension of time on the grounds that it was seeking a complete solution to all debts and had already obtained the plaintiff's consent. Judge Gui, who was in charge of the trial, believed that since the defendant had

already admitted the amount of the debt, there was no need for an extension, and then announced the end of the debate and scheduled a judgment. Under the advice of the two lawyers, they deeply considered that once a judgment was made, it might affect other aspects, so they still complained and insisted that the words "oppose the announcement of the end of the debate" be recorded in the minutes.

### Lawsuit to Recover Tuition Fees: Principal of Zhendong School Replaced

### Wife Reports Husband for Adultery: Husband Dies by Poisoning

Qin Zuyin, a native of Changzhou, currently working as a clerk in the pseudo-Unified Tax Bureau and nephew of Sheng Gongbao, married Wu Zhen, a woman from Xuzhou, and then took He Lizhen, a dancer from the Dadong Dance Hall, as his concubine this year, living together at No. 15, Sanxingfang, Connaught Road. Wu learned of this and hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to report to the Gordon Road Police Station.

He died yesterday, and the body was sent to the autopsy office by the police station to await the report to the court for an autopsy and re-examination.

### Zhao Zhimin's Letter of Clarification: My Daughter Joins the Army Voluntarily

Saving the Country is Protecting the Family, Loyalty is Completing Filial Piety

Respected Editor,

I am writing to you today to clarify that my daughter, Guomei, has always been trained in poetry and etiquette, and strictly adhered to the teachings of Yuan Bing. She has been praised by teachers and neighbors for her filial piety and thoughtful discernment. Before August 13th, she graduated as a champion from Shangwen Primary School in the city and won a scholarship to be recommended to Shaoxing Shanghai Women's Middle School. At that time, it was the peak of the patriotic movement, and her enthusiasm was always expressed in her words. The family thought that this was the normal state of patriotic youth, so they did not care. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 16th of this month, she quietly left home and joined the army, giving up her studies. At first, I asked the police station to visit and inquire, sent people to stand at the port and wait, and then posted a notice in the newspaper to inform relatives and friends, originally hoping that she would return home, comfort her mother, and help her with her luggage and funds to strengthen her journey. It is not really to stop her ambition, and there is no doubt about Chen, and there is no other worry in it. Therefore, I calmly dealt with it and went to Wuxing to handle goods. It was not until I returned home the day before yesterday that my family showed me a news item published in your newspaper on the 22nd of this month. After reading it, I was filled with indignation. The so-called teacher-student love affair and running away together did not match the facts. Yesterday, I received a letter from my daughter from the front line, reporting that she had been commissioned to a formal position and was engaged in practical work. I am very happy and can rest assured that I am far away. In the letter, she also said that today she joined the army, and she showed the spirit of a woman. Next spring, she will return in triumph and fulfill her wish to honor her ancestors. Moreover, the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every man. A patriot sacrifices himself to achieve benevolence. If a mother seeks to live by harming benevolence, saving the country is protecting the family, and loyalty is completing filial piety. At this time, the War of Resistance has reached the final stage of struggle, which is a critical moment, and the final victory belongs to us. I hope that the hall will not be sad and worried because the woman is traveling a long distance, but should be happy and celebrate the woman's heart to serve the country. Her words are so慷慨激昂, that they can make cowards rise up, and women compete for glory. It can be praised by the society, and her parents are also honored. I have always thought that your newspaper's news is known for its impartiality and realism. I respectfully ask you to publish my original letter as it is to clarify the facts and stop the rumors. I hereby offer this, and I wish you peace.

Sincerely,

Zhao Zhimin

June 30, 29th year.

### Review of the Implementation of the Inheritance Tax

— Cao Huo

The Process of Planning the Tax

The much-discussed inheritance tax is finally being implemented nationwide starting today.

Inheritance is 100% unearned income; John Stuart Mill said, "No one should enjoy more inheritance than is necessary for his independent living." It should be heavily taxed. England began collecting it as early as 1694. There were also proposals for collection in China at the beginning of the Republic, but for many years, drafting bills and setting principles were just "hearing the ladder rattle, but not seeing anyone come down." 1928 was considered a time to make a decision. In May, the National Government made a declaration to implement the inheritance tax to develop education, and in July of the same year, the National Financial Conference had a proposal to implement income and inheritance taxes as special taxes for education. In 1929, the Inheritance Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules were further formulated, and it seemed that they could be promoted step by step. Unexpectedly, the foreign experts of the Kemmerer Commission, who were heavily hired to reform finance at that time, believed that, according to Chinese customs, wealthy families mostly relied on inheritance to live on. If inheritance tax were collected, it would be greatly disadvantageous to China (see the Tax System Report of the Commission). These foreign financial experts valued China's large family system as much as foreign education experts advised us to read the Analects of Confucius and Mencius, respecting our old morality with the same good intentions. As a result, the implementation of the inheritance tax was once again shelved.

Later, in 1936, under Finance Minister Kong's policy of increasing taxes to balance fiscal revenues and expenditures, the government again made a firm decision to implement it. Therefore, the principles and drafts were revised in many ways. In September 1938, the Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations were passed, and on December 30, 1939, the Implementation Rules of the Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations were promulgated. Now that it has been officially implemented, China's finances have taken a major step forward on the path of direct taxation, which is truly another cause for celebration during the period of resistance and nation-building.

Judging from the promulgated Provisional Regulations, they are meticulous and comprehensive, and quite satisfactory.

First of all, we must point out that the adoption of the gross estate system in these regulations is its greatest advantage. The gross estate tax (also known as inheritance tax) is different from the distributed inheritance tax (also known as succession tax). The former taxes the total value of the estate, while the latter taxes each heir or beneficiary separately based on their degree of kinship. Regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the two, it is generally believed that the gross estate tax has higher revenue when calculated, but it does not consider the degree of kinship, so close and distant relatives are treated the same despite having different opportunities, which is unfair. Conversely, the distributed inheritance tax taxes based on the degree of kinship, which is fair, but the calculation is complicated, and because the tax exemption is not applied just once, the revenue is reduced. It is said that the Legislative Yuan had many objections to the draft adopting the gross estate system because they considered the gross estate system unfair, holding the above view. In fact, the distributed inheritance system distinguishes between close and distant relatives, which encourages the inheritance of property to close relatives, thus concentrating wealth in the hands of one or two people (the children of wealthy people, by virtue of their father's position, money, and power, have probably already made a considerable fortune before their father's death). Is this fair? Moreover, so-called distant relatives in China, where inheritance is traditionally passed on to the closest heirs, can only receive inheritance if they have made great contributions to the deceased during their lifetime. The idea that they have a greater opportunity than the closest children is unfounded. Therefore, I believe that the gross estate system is fairer than the distributed inheritance system, and it is simpler and generates more revenue, which is exactly what is needed at this time and place. China's inheritance tax "is a central tax, but the central government should distribute its net revenue to provinces, cities, and counties according to the following standards: (1) 15% to provinces, (2) 25% to cities and counties. Provinces, cities, and counties should use 40% of the aforementioned net revenue for educational expenses." (See Article 5 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law promulgated in 1935). The local governments' share can also compensate for the loss from abolishing miscellaneous taxes, and its use is mainly limited to developing education, which is quite commendable in today's situation where education is becoming increasingly important but funding is becoming increasingly difficult.

There were two theories regarding the scope of inheritance tax: the territoriality principle and the nationality principle. The former is: all property left in this country at the time of death is taxed, regardless of nationality or whether they are citizens of this country; the latter is: all citizens of this country, their inheritance, regardless of where it is located, whether in another country or this country, must be taxed. China adopts both (see Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations) because the territoriality principle alone easily induces capital to escape abroad, and the nationality principle alone would not generate much tax revenue. The combination of the two shows careful consideration.

"The term 'inheritance' in these Regulations refers to the movable property, immovable property, and all other rights with property value of the deceased" (Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations). The meaning of inheritance adopts traditional academic theory, with death and property as the constituent elements of inheritance. However, some people believe: "The finding of lost property and the discovery of buried objects, after a certain period of public notice, if the owners still do not claim their property, it proves that they have no possibility of retrieving the property, and the property contains the meaning of inheritance," and "the inheritance tax is set up to limit people's accidental good fortune, and the good fortune of finders and discoverers is no less than that of those who receive inheritance." Therefore, they advocate expanding the interpretation of inheritance and including the tax on lost property and buried objects in the calculation, and propose to "presume that the recipient cannot prove that the original owner was alive at the time of inheritance" and tax them according to the regulations. This opinion has considerable merit, and I believe the financial authorities may still consider it in the future.

The valuation of inheritance in various countries uses market price as the standard. This is also the case in China (see Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations). However, while valuing general property according to market price is fair, it is not the case for immovable property such as land and houses, especially land, which is not easy to liquidate. Fortunately, Article 12 of the Implementing Regulations states, "If the valuation of immovable property such as land and houses cannot be assessed according to the market price at the time of inheritance, the amount shall be calculated by restoring the rent at a weekly interest rate of 12%," and there are other preferential measures for relief. Article 9 of the Provisional Regulations has a rule for taxing owner-cultivated land at half price. Of course, this also has the meaning of encouraging owner-cultivation. In recent years, the rural areas have suffered greatly, and the people of Jiangsu have been impoverished. To revive the rural areas, this regulation is indispensable. Similarly, Article 10 stipulates that "trees that are legally prohibited from being cut down or have not reached the age of felling should be deducted first," in order to promote afforestation. All of these are the advantages of our inheritance tax.

However, I still have a few opinions on the Provisional Regulations:

1. A certain amount of educational funds should be stipulated for minor heirs; funeral expenses should also be set at a maximum amount. These three, together with the deceased's final medical expenses, should be deducted first when calculating the total value of the deceased's estate; this point can be added to Article 10 of the Provisional Regulations.

2. Article 7 "(2) The inheritance of officers, soldiers, and civil servants of the army, navy, and air force who died in battle or due to injuries sustained in battlefield service" should be changed to "The inheritance of officers... who died..., whose total value is less than ×× yuan" should be tax-exempt, and there should be a certain limit. In fact, many soldiers and civil servants in China possess huge wealth. Although dying in battle is for the country, it is not necessary to give such excessive preferential treatment.

3. Article 7 (5) Property donated to educational, cultural, or charitable public welfare undertakings not exceeding 500,000 yuan is tax-exempt. This is also worth reconsidering. For the government to implement its original motivation for developing education and culture through inheritance tax, and to encourage citizens to donate to charitable public welfare undertakings and eliminate the old concept of caring only for one's own family, the donated portion should be completely tax-exempt.

4. Article 8 "If inheritance that has already been subject to inheritance tax is inherited again within three years, the value of the property that has already been taxed shall be exempt from taxation again": The government is too "concerned" about public sentiment. I agree with the proposal of the Italian Engenis Rignano. His proposal (or method) is this: the portion of the deceased's inheritance that comes from their own hard work and frugality is taxed at the normal rate; the property inherited directly from their father or others is taxed at a rate of 50%; the property inherited indirectly from their father or others is taxed at a rate of 100%. Only this method can completely limit people's accidental good fortune; only this can encourage people's hard work and frugality; only this can increase revenue (the national budget for this year only lists 2 million yuan), meet the needs of the current resistance and nation-building; and only this can regulate capital and achieve the ideal of people's livelihood. Assuming that this is done, it is necessary to divide people's property into two parts at the beginning of inheritance or, preferably, when investigating people's property after the promulgation of this tax system: (1) two-thirds or one-half is considered the result of their own hard work, (2) two-thirds or one-half is considered inheritance that has already gone through one transfer.

Regarding the inheritance tax system itself, that's probably all I have to say.

### The Problem of Property Investigation

However, whether the inheritance tax succeeds or not depends half on the quality of the tax system itself and half on whether there are difficulties after implementation and whether it can prevent tax evasion. This involves the issue of property investigation. Evasion, concealment, and private gifts of various kinds are probably unavoidable. Here, we must remember that China's current resistance is a national resistance. The glory of our ancestors and the happiness of our descendants all depend on it. "Those with money give money, those with strength give strength," and this is the truth. When the majority of the people are fighting with guns and bullets and shedding their blood on the front lines, it is unacceptable to evade taxes on unearned income. It is unacceptable and should not be condoned or pitied. So, what methods can be used to overcome this difficult hurdle of property investigation? There is! There are the people; mobilize the people, organize them, and let them report, then it will be easy and reliable. Even the most cunning landlords and wealthy gentry cannot escape the eyes of the majority of poor people. The closing remarks of the Fourth National Political Consultative Conference said, "If China wants to achieve its absolutely necessary war objectives, it must mobilize the whole nation and strengthen all facilities for long-term resistance." As for the need to abolish household names, ancestral hall names, pen names, and nicknames, and limit each person to using one name, this should be implemented immediately and need not be said further.

(1) How are the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate calculated? Please list the calculation method and formula using the US dollar as an example, and explain in detail. (The answer was published in issue 324 of this publication)

(2) What is the basis for the rise and fall of gold prices? Please list the formula and explain in detail how to calculate it.

(3) Is it more advantageous to purchase US dollars in Hong Kong or Haiphong with Hong Kong dollars or Vietnamese currency than to buy US dollars in Shanghai with legal tender?

Mr. Ye Jingjiang Answers

(2) Previously, the rise and fall of gold prices in Shanghai were based on London cash. Since England stopped the gold standard in 1931, it has been changed to the US cash exchange rate to determine the rise and fall. However, sometimes the supply and demand and changes in the current situation are also sufficient to affect the rise and fall of market prices. (For example, if the price of US dollars is 35 yuan per ounce, then one US dollar is 16 yuan in legal tender (exchange rate 517/32), and each ounce weighs 848495 qiankaiping, which is multiplied by 8525 to get the Shanghai gold price.

(3) Purchasing US dollars in Hong Kong or Haiphong with Hong Kong dollars or Vietnamese currency requires going through proper procedures and applying to the bank due to restrictions by the local governments. Black market transactions in Shanghai are not restricted and can be traded at any time, which is more convenient.

Cheng Jiyi Jun Asks

(1) After the European War, England controlled foreign exchange. Why can British pounds still be sold in Shanghai even though China was not included in the pound sterling group? Although it is said to be speculative buying and selling, it must be based on actual needs. If merchant A sells £10,000 to merchant B, and merchant B actually needs £1,000, in theory, they would have to obtain a certificate or draft from merchant A's office or agent in England to withdraw the pounds. Is this not the same as trading British pounds in Shanghai? Wouldn't the control lose its effectiveness? How can the British government turn a blind eye to this? (2) Also, if A's US dollars are in Liverpool or Hong Kong, and B needs to withdraw funds in London, the transaction must still be done through a bank. Would the bank dare to violate the law and serve them? Furthermore, if A has funds deposited in a London bank, they must hand over the deposit slip to B, who can only complete the transaction after sending the deposit slip to London and withdrawing the funds. If this is the case, it takes a long time and the procedures are complicated. Why is the foreign exchange market in Shanghai so convenient? Delivery can be made on the same day?

(3) If merchants A and B do not know each other and the transaction amount is very large, does the broker guarantee that A will deliver the British pounds to B in England after receiving B's domestic currency? Does the broker have the ability to guarantee this?

(4) According to previous reports, Hong Kong restricts the export of banknotes and foreign exchange of non-pound sterling groups. However, according to the exchange rate information column of the Ta Kung Pao, Hong Kong banks buy and sell Shanghai currency every day as before, and the amount is always in the tens or hundreds of thousands. However, there are various restrictions on individuals entrusting banks to exchange funds. What is the truth of the matter?

(5) The market often hears that a certain amount of British pounds or US dollars is with a certain merchant. These British and US dollars must be bearer drafts, only recording the amount and the location of the withdrawing bank. Can they be bought and sold in all major cities with a foreign exchange market?

(6) If merchant A needs to deliver US dollars to merchant B in Hong Kong, can they buy US dollars in Shanghai or US dollars for delivery in Hong Kong and then send the voucher to Hong Kong to be delivered to merchant B? Or resell it to domestic merchants?

### —Mr. Ye Qingjiang Answers—

Regarding "Why can British pounds still be sold in Shanghai even though England controls foreign exchange and China was not included in the pound sterling group," it is because the payment is made in London, which does not violate the control regulations. Therefore, British pounds can still be sold in Shanghai. For example, if A sells £10,000 to B, then A must issue a cheque for £10,000 from A's British agent bank to B, and B can use the cheque to withdraw cash from the British agent bank. What B gets is £10,000, which can still be used within England and cannot be exchanged for US dollars or other foreign currencies. British capital has not flowed out of the country, so it is not within the scope of control.

Banks can still apply for British pounds for merchants who need them for legitimate purposes, and are not subject to control. Therefore, if A's US dollars are in Liverpool or Hong Kong, as long as the proper procedures are followed, i.e., A issues a British pound cheque to B, any bank within England can handle all the procedures on behalf of A. This does not violate the law. As for "A has funds deposited in a London bank... Why can the trade of British pounds in Shanghai be settled on the same day?" it is because it is a telegraphic transfer. Selling or buying is all based on telegram communication. Trading with bills of exchange requires going through bank procedures to be cashed, so the procedures are naturally more troublesome.

In addition to deposits, there are also agricultural products exported from China, such as tung oil, pig bristles, and tea, and light industrial products that are shipped abroad, all of which can be exchanged for gold pounds, which are temporarily deposited in London banks, waiting for a good opportunity to sell them. In addition, overseas Chinese send money to their home country, which is also a large amount. Overseas Chinese often entrust banks here to sell British pounds on their behalf.

Brokers can only guarantee the transaction on the same day or limit delivery to Shanghai for agency purchases and sales and cannot guarantee whether British pounds will be delivered in England. However, in fact, there is no problem if the purchase and sale of gold pound drafts is handled by a reliable bank.

Although the Hong Kong government has ordered a ban on the export of Hong Kong dollars, in fact, if there is a legitimate purpose and Hong Kong banknotes are needed, one can still apply to the government-approved commercial banks in Hong Kong for purchase and sale. Speculative sales are absolutely prohibited.

Bearer British and US dollar drafts can all be transferred for purchase and sale in this city's market.

If merchant A needs to deliver a certain amount of US dollars to merchant B in Hong Kong, they can buy US dollars for delivery in Shanghai or Hong Kong. B can use the draft to exchange for US dollars in Hong Kong. If it is a Bearer draft, it can also be resold to merchant C. Here are brief answers to the three questions of Zhang Shiwen Jun:

(1) The reported price of US dollars refers to the price of pure gold contained in a US$5 coin. The price of US dollars refers to the exchange rate of a US$1 banknote. Therefore, the prices of the two differ greatly. The same is true for British gold and British pounds.

A US$5 coin contains 0.240176 shi qian liang of pure gold, which is multiplied by the red price to get the market price of a US$5 coin.

US$5 coin

A British £1 coin contains 0.23382 shi qian liang of pure gold, which is multiplied by the red price to get the market price. The calculation is as above.

(2) Regarding the weight and fineness of coins from various countries, please refer to issue 301 of this publication.

(3) Soverein is the name of a coin in the British currency system calculated in pounds, with denominations of £5, £2, £1, and half a pound. Sterling is used to mean a standard pound sterling.

Liu Ying Jun

The blocked marks used in Germany have a high value domestically but have no market abroad, so their value is extremely low. However, in principle, the foreign purchasing power of free marks (i.e., TT marks) should be equivalent to the domestic purchasing power of blocked marks. However, the purchasing power of blocked marks is limited to within Germany, so even if the exchange rate of free marks abroad represents the value of blocked marks, various transportation costs should be deducted, resulting in a discount. This discount, in addition to including various transportation costs, is also affected by the supply and demand in the market, so it is extremely large. Especially in wartime today, there is only a market price for German currency, and transportation is very difficult. The amount of the discount is even more difficult to calculate. Therefore, the foreign value of blocked marks cannot be compared with that of free marks.

When your respected friend in Germany buys books on your behalf and pays with blocked marks, and you plan to compensate their relatives in Shanghai with legal tender, this causes difficulties in pricing. I sincerely seek your inquiry to this publication. In my humble opinion, in order to prevent both parties from losing out, it is more convenient to calculate by referring to the pricing method of German goods in Shanghai. I don't know what you think. Here are brief answers to the two questions of Li Guangzhou Jun:

(1) In early March of 1928, China implemented a foreign exchange declaration system, centralizing the right to supply foreign exchange to the Central Bank. Illegal elements took advantage of the special circumstances of the concessions and continued to buy and sell foreign exchange freely outside the Central Bank, thus forming this black market for foreign exchange. Therefore, those who enter and leave the black market should be punished by law.

(2) Please read the article "What is the Future of Foreign Exchange?" serialized in the recent issues of this publication to find the answer to your question.

### Factors Affecting Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Last Week

According to a report by the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute, the foreign exchange market this week was relatively calm. The highest US dollar exchange rate was 6.3125 yuan, the lowest was 5.9375 yuan. The highest British pound exchange rate was 3 pence 96875, and the lowest was 3 pence 75. According to market rumors, the factors affecting the fluctuations are as follows:

1. Tensions in Vietnam 2. US Fleet Mobilization 3. Approaching End of the Month 4. British and American Exchanges Lengthening 5. Falling Prices

At the beginning of the week, the tense situation in Vietnam, the unstable border in Hong Kong, and the occupation of Xujiahui in Shanghai should have tightened the market, but the transaction volume was extremely small, and most people were waiting and watching. The US dollar was more sensitive to the news than the exchange rates because Citibank's exchange rate was convenient for retail transactions. In the past two weeks, given the calm exchange market, large investors lacked interest, and retail investors were eager to move after being quiet for too long. However, the momentum was not strong, and it fluctuated at the slightest stimulation. The US fleet's mobilization, if aimed at the Far East, seemed to have a positive impact on the exchange market. If it was to support Britain, the doubts about foreign currencies would be heavier, and the exchange market could also be seen as lengthening. However, the international situation is constantly changing, and opinions vary from person to person, depending on future developments. Approaching the end of the month, coupled with the three-day holiday, operators avoided taking risks, and there were very few transactions. Moreover, after the expansion of the European War, foreign banks such as China-Italy, China-France, Oriental, China-Belgium, and the Netherlands have rarely interacted in the exchange market. Currently, only Chase, Citibank, and Advantage are more active, and Chinese commercial banks also appear and disappear, leading to the current depletion of the market. Even if there are transactions, there are few opponents. The British and US exchange rates rose to 4.01 yuan on Friday, mostly due to the tightening of management by the United Kingdom. What the content is is still unknown, so there are many different explanations. Some say that the United States will assist Britain financially, and some say that Europe may be at peace. However, the traditional concept in Shanghai is that the legal currency is more closely linked to gold pounds, so when the US dollar rises, the exchange market tends to be seen as loosening. Falling prices should reflect the increased purchasing power of the legal currency. However, the current cost of living has not changed, and the sharp rise and fall are only objects of speculation. In the past, the people of Shanghai's belief in the legal currency was sometimes unclear. If they did not rush to buy foreign exchange, they would hoard it. After the outbreak of the European War, this long-standing problem became even more intense. Exchange rates and hoarding are causally related, resulting in an unprecedented surge. But how long has it been? Commodity prices have fallen drastically, and exchange rates have also tended to loosen at the same time. The most obvious example is that the prices of foreign shares and cotton yarn have fallen by more than one or two times. However, because the excessive fall in prices is enough to reduce imports, there is little demand for exchange rates. Even those who have foreign exchange intend to sell it in order to buy goods that have fallen in price. The supply in the exchange market has increased. Those who take advantage of this psychology take the opportunity to sell short, putting considerable pressure on the market, and the general floating longs are quite panicked. At first, they hesitated and watched, and then they painfully settled, resulting in the current situation. By Saturday, the trend changed slightly. The British and US exchange rates were small, and they should have lengthened first, but instead they shrunk slightly with the US dollar. In addition, the yarn market suddenly showed a tendency to rise, and the exchange rate discounts wanted to fall but stopped. Although there was inevitably some short-covering and the role of the month-end holiday, there was an intention to try again in the market.

### Coal Ball Factory Price Increase

Coal ball factory prices, due to the previous week's loosening of the exchange rate and reduced material costs, although outwardly maintained, secretly experienced a price drop to compete. Yesterday, due to an unfavorable rumor, the prices of coal balls from Nanyang, Guohua, and Yitaixing became firm again. Wholesale prices for the same industry have generally increased, with a carload costing one hundred and forty-eight yuan, and additional cartage for delivery. Retail prices at the door of shops on this street are generally eight yuan per load, it is said.

### Government Red Dates Arrive in One Hundred Packages

Top-quality government red dates have long been out of stock in the market, and merchants have limited inventory on hand, so the market is quite strong. Yesterday, it was heard that Qingdao merchants had shipped one hundred packages, priced at thirty-eight yuan. However, because the merchants' counteroffer was too far off, no transaction has been made yet.

### Dutch Red Sugar Rises by Eight Cents

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten, with both red and white sugar improving. The current price of Grade 24 white sugar set by the guild was 69.4 yuan at this company and 69 yuan at other companies, up by five cents. Re-exported sugar was 55 yuan, up by one yuan. Taikoo's "B Mark" refined white sugar was initially 78.5 yuan but later reached 79 yuan. Dutch red sugar was between 56.5 yuan and 56.8 yuan, up by eight cents overall. Guotang Xinghua Dagong powder was offered at 100 yuan, but there were no transactions. Yesterday, 30 packages of ordinary Gong powder were offered at 86.5 yuan.

### Tapioca Flour and Sago - Sporadic Transactions

The market has ample tapioca flour in stock. Recently, due to sluggish demand, only sporadic transactions have occurred, and the trend is weaker. Currently, Feiqilin brand is priced at 67 yuan, KG and SanX brand are both priced at 65 yuan, ShuangTA brand is 55 yuan, Peacock is 55 yuan, TT brand is 52 yuan, and Sanling brand is 45 yuan, about one yuan lower than before. Large-grain sago is still selling for 90 yuan, and smaller grains for 88 yuan, down by two yuan.

### Bud Sticks Fall by Four to Five Yuan

Although there have been no recent arrivals of bud sticks, demand has decreased, so the market supply is still considered ample. Currently, there are only sporadic transactions, and the market price has also weakened, falling by four to five "codes" from the previous high.

### Dried Longan Meat Remains Expensive

There is no continued arrival of dried longan meat, and sun-dried goods from the docks have not been shipped for even longer, leading to stockouts. It is heard that scattered inventories have been sold for as high as 210 yuan. Yesterday, according to letters from the production areas, inventories are limited, and production prices are as high as 200 yuan. Adding all external costs, it is difficult to break even. Therefore, it is unlikely that new goods will arrive before the new harvest.

### Ribbed Steel Bar Market Stagnant

Transactions of ribbed steel bars have been sluggish recently. Apart from minor purchases by local construction companies, there have been no transactions from out-of-town merchants. The market is particularly stagnant, and the market situation is therefore depressed. Industry insiders, due to the perception of a lack of supply, are unwilling to significantly lower prices. Although there are not many transactions, empty orders must also remain high. Currently, the market price is 1,350 yuan per ton for 3/8 inch and 1/2 inch, and 1,300 yuan per ton for 5/8 inch to 1 inch, with no significant decline. It is heard that only over ten tons were traded previously, divided between construction companies and retail buyers. There is very little wholesale business.

### Silver Dollar Fluctuations

Money shops are a major part of the market, and the price of silver dollars is constantly changing. Some change once a day, some twice, and some three or four times. What is the reason for this? When silver is in short supply, the price of silver increases sharply; when silver dollars are scarce, the exchange rate skyrockets. Traders meticulously calculate every penny, which is not surprising. However, there are also those who take advantage of the situation and engage in empty trading, without actual goods changing hands, relying only on ledger entries. Buyers hope for the price to increase daily; sellers hope for the price to fall. Driven by greed, reason is clouded by profit. Initially, they accumulate thousands upon thousands of dollars without seeing actual cash, driven by insatiable desires. Subsequently, when it comes time to settle accounts, one after another, they are filled with endless regrets. This trend is most prevalent in Ningbo, Shaoxing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, and there are many who have lost their fortunes and even their lives because of it. Therefore, government officials issue notices to prohibit this, with clear and thorough warnings, but to no avail, as people outwardly comply but secretly defy. This trend is difficult to completely eliminate. In recent days, the price fluctuations of silver dollars have been frequently reported. From 72.0 cents, it has risen to 76.0 cents, and now it has fallen to 74.0 cents. In addition, there are constant fluctuations in the exchange rates between silver and silver dollars. This is precisely the mechanism of market prosperity and decline, the boundary between commercial circulation and stagnation. Those who profit from buying and selling short will inevitably lose elsewhere. It is feared that there will be changes in money shops. The set exchange rate for silver dollars in Shanghai has been 73.0 cents for a long time, but it is inevitable that there will be changes soon.

### The Vegetarian Movement

— Cao Xing

The practice of vegetarianism has a long history, with its emphasis on abstaining from killing living beings, so Buddhist followers regard it as the only path to liberation. In fact, even from a scientific understanding, it is a good precept with three major benefits: peacefulness, economy, and hygiene.

The purpose of promoting vegetarianism now is not to promote Buddhism, but to respond to the environment and save money! Although the author has not tasted meat for three months, I have heard that the price of meat has risen to two yuan per catty, and other prices are imaginable. With such expensive meat prices, only wealthy families are qualified to enjoy it, and those of us who live on salaries can only look at it.

Originally, the most distressed people in the world are we. Every day of the year, we are busy with clothing and food, barely eking out a living. Unfortunately, we have encountered a troubled world, endured the baptism of gunfire, and also suffered the exploitation of unscrupulous merchants! This time, the increase in water rates, the additional levies by the Public Works Department, and the creation of opportunities for second landlords!

Since the threat to life is so serious, our only option is to plan for hardship and strive to save money. There are many ways to save money, but vegetarianism occupies a very important position. Although vegetarian dishes are not cheap either, they are much more economical than eating meat. At least, in terms of consumption, we can save one-third of our expenses. As the saying goes, "A little each day adds up to a lot in ten days." This can be tested in practice.

Some people say, "Humans are carnivorous animals. If they eat vegetarian food for a long time, it may be detrimental to their health." I think this is not entirely credible. To give an example: Buddhist followers who eat vegetarian food all their lives do not have weak bodies. Their lifespans are also in their seventies, eighties, or even hundreds. It can be seen that vegetarianism does not hinder health, only cleaner and more hygienic than eating meat.

It is common to see health experts eating vegetarian food in the summer. Eating vegetarian food is ultimately a good way to benefit life: both economical and hygienic, killing two birds with one stone. Why don't we promote it? In short, not eating rice can lead to starvation; not eating meat will not lead to death!

### Promoting Short Clothing

— Bai Shui

Wearing a long gown makes movement inconvenient, especially in summer. We can often see people getting out of trams whose long gowns are not pulled up, causing them to be stepped on and torn by the people behind, resulting in arguments between the two parties. Sometimes, when we are carrying a lot of things in our hands, we cannot pull up our long gowns when walking up the stairs, so we often step on the front of our gowns, making it difficult to walk. Therefore, wearing a long gown hinders movement everywhere, making it difficult for us to move much, and we become weak. Everyone says that Chinese people are physically weak and lack activity, and this is one of the reasons. The reason for the lack of activity is that wearing a long gown is also one of the reasons. Therefore, to speak grandly, to strengthen the country, we must overthrow the long gown; to speak modestly, to have freedom and convenience of movement, we must overthrow the long gown. In today's expensive life, when the price of cotton cloth is several times higher than before "August 13th", it is already very difficult for us to add a piece of clothing, let alone spend money on materials to make a long gown. Therefore, to make clothing conform to economic principles, we should naturally overthrow the long gown.

Wearing a long gown and not wearing pants may be said to conform to economic principles; however, wearing pants with a long gown is still necessary. The long hem wastes a lot of cloth, the tailoring is more expensive than short clothes, and the washing is more expensive than short clothes. Moreover, with the added inconvenience, why do we spend more money to buy an inconvenience?

Some people say that not wearing a long gown is impolite, which is a joke! Do the working class who wear short clothes not understand etiquette? Is wearing a long gown and looking down on everyone, without regard for anyone, considered polite? Whether or not there is politeness depends entirely on the actions expressed from within, and has no fundamental relationship with whether or not a long gown is worn.

Some people say that we are used to wearing long gowns, and we feel uncomfortable not wearing them, which is also a joke! Are there not many Cantonese people who do not wear long gowns? If you walk into Hong Kong wearing a long gown and stroll around the streets, at that time, do you think you look good or not?

In winter, because of the cold weather, wearing long clothes can be warmer. As for summer, it really makes no sense to wear a long gown again. I remember that before "August 13th", the editors of the Shanghai Kaiming Bookstore, regardless of whether they wore Chinese or Western clothes, all wore short shirts. Because the sun blocked by the straw hats was very faint, everyone did not wear straw hats but opened paper umbrellas. I think we can imitate this action.

In a word, long gowns not only waste cloth but also hinder movement. We should abolish them. Even short shirts should not have sleeves that are too long, so as not to hinder movement, which is also very important.

### Random Thoughts on Residence

— Zheng Yimei

Damp walls damage hanging paintings. Not hanging them seems too plain and lonely, failing to suit one's nature. The only solution is to fold newspapers, making them half an inch narrower than the painting, and nail them to the wall. Then, hang the painting. This way, moisture is isolated, and the newspaper is completely hidden by the painting, maintaining aesthetic appeal. If Li Yu, author of "Idle Sentiments," knew this, it would be a valuable addition to his collection.

A pavilion enveloped in the setting sun and thin mist has a ethereal, almost immortal quality. I recall a former senior's line, "Setting sun pavilion paints autumn traces," which I believe surpasses the artistry of painting and calligraphy.

The proverb says, "No matter how beautiful the peony, it relies on the green leaves for support." In fact, the green leaves are a different plant, not the peony's own leaves. "A Spot Record" states, "Peonies should be planted with green leaves in the same place for mutual flourishing." Those decorating gardens should be aware of this.

Paintings should be changed frequently, not only to prevent the silk and paper from becoming dull and old, but also to refresh the atmosphere and adjust one's perspective. Landscapes, figures, flowers, and beauties should be displayed interchangeably. Excessive simplicity can diminish the meaning. When changing paintings, books should also be readily available. Bookrests should be placed on either side, made of fine bamboo, with a cloud-white copper finial at one end. Even if not finely carved, they should have a delicate and intricate design. Otherwise, if they are rough and crude, like a beautiful woman with ugly companions, they will be unsuitable.

Everyday items, such as wine jugs and tea canisters, are often prepared casually without careful consideration. In reality, anything seen daily and touched daily should primarily evoke aesthetic pleasure. Otherwise, feelings of aversion will arise, failing to comfort the spirit. Moreover, exquisite items should be cherished and cared for, allowing them to last longer, which is also an economical practice.

When it comes to room furnishings, seek elegance over novelty. As time progresses endlessly, novelty soon becomes outdated. It is better to choose elegant items that remain unchanged, pleasing as always, and more appropriate.

A zither can cultivate emotions, a sword can express spirit, books can inspire ambition, and paintings can soothe the mind. These four items are indispensable in a home.

Arrangements should be skillful rather than grand, sparse rather than dense, simple rather than elaborate, and plain rather than ostentatious.

My deceased friend, Mr. Hu Jichen, said, "Beautiful clothes are not as good as beautiful rooms. The beauty of clothes pleases others. Only the beauty of rooms entertains oneself." Wise words!

At the end of the garden, plant more fine trees to provide dense shade, concealing the walls. This way, although it is the end, one does not feel it. Those within will not feel confined.

### One Week's Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Pork and yellow croaker are originally the most common items in meat dishes. Now, pork costs two yuan per catty, and yellow croaker costs six or seven cents per catty. How can I create this economical menu? However, rice must be eaten, and to eat rice, you must eat vegetables. Since meat dishes are unaffordable, I have to reduce the quantity as much as possible within the realm of possibility, and eat more vegetarian dishes. Fortunately, it is hot in summer, and eating vegetarian food is also a hygienic practice. I see that in some places, there is not even rice, and people are digging up grass roots and tree bark to eat. Being able to eat rice and vegetables on this isolated island is still a blessing. Nowadays, although I still include two meat dishes every day, I avoid the expensive ones and strive for economy. Whether you eat them or not is up to you.

### Viewing Bai Jiao's Orchid and Fruit and Vegetable Paintings

— Zhou Shoujuan

I work like a horse for clothing, food, housing, and transportation every day, hardly knowing the joy of bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting. My friend, Bai Jiao of Yunjian, is the opposite. He immerses himself in bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting day and night, possessing an antique style and remarkable skill. He is an elegant person, indeed a refined person. He has exhibited hundreds of his works at the Da Xin Art Gallery for July. His calligraphy and seal carving are extraordinary. He has also displayed his orchid and fruit and vegetable paintings, which are also deeply rooted in antiquity. In recent days, prices are exorbitant, and people are struggling to survive. Even these flowers, grasses, fruits, and vegetables are not easily obtained. Viewing Bai Jiao's paintings is a delight to the eye and heart, and can alleviate hunger, perhaps in the sense of quenching thirst with plums. I have composed two quatrains:

Writing the soul of Xiang with each flower and leaf, I say that the scholar's habits remain,
There are countless worries and patriotic tears, flowing through the nine acres, planting sorrow and hatred.

Talented men of a hundred generations have no food to eat, Sighing that it is not easy to live in Chang'an,
Chen Shuo exhausted and starved to death, I beg you for the vegetables in the painting. (Note: The first line is adapted from Ding Yu's line, which is used today to praise the difficult times. Who says it is not appropriate?)

### Strolling on the Road

— Chi Er

Most ordinary people think that "strolling on the road" is harmful and unhelpful. When there is nothing to do, it is better to sit at home. Now is a turbulent and eventful world, so it is best to avoid unexpected disasters outside. This argument is also correct, but I disagree. Because after we finish our work, we feel bored at home, so it is better to go to the road for a walk. On the one hand, we can take a walk to restore our physical and mental fatigue. At the same time, we can also pay attention to the dynamics of society, such as understanding the small scams of chess stalls, used goods stalls, and poker games on the roadside, and look at the things displayed in the glass windows on both sides, which are diverse and beautiful, opening our eyes and knowing the actual prices. In short, when strolling on the road, we can pay attention at all times and be careful everywhere. There is no place where we cannot gain some knowledge. Zeng Wenzheng Gong of the Qing Dynasty said: "Everywhere you pay attention is learning." I think this sentence is extremely correct. Because the universe is vast and full of wonders, the knowledge gained from books in school is limited. In the future, we will feel that it is not enough to apply in society, and we must seek some living knowledge to supplement it. Why not do it?

Finally, I must declare that I hope everyone will not misunderstand and think that I am promoting "strolling on the road". You must know that this can only be done after the work is completed, because the work at hand is very busy, so there is no time to stroll on the road. Now I am talking about doing it when you have free time, not "strolling on the road" that is done by "street walkers". As for the dangers on the road, you only need to be careful and not join in the excitement or get involved in the hustle and bustle. (Moved to Relieve Disaster)

### A Brief Account of Dietary Nourishment - Plum

— Zhang Jingren

The plum is a kind of tall tree, with flowers blooming in the cold, its shadow filling the water and moon, and its fragrance spreading far and wide. After He Xun and Lin Hejing's descriptions, its beauty has increased even more. Therefore, every year at the end of the year, poets and writers use it as a clear offering for the study. Its flowers, dew, seeds, kernels, medicine stems, and roots can all be used as medicine. Single-petaled green plums are the best, and those with buds are more potent. The fruit ripens during the summer rainy season, with a emerald green color when unripe, and an apricot yellow to red color when ripe, with a sour taste and plenty of juice. According to legend, when Cao Cao led his army and lost their way, they were extremely thirsty and had no water. So he said, "There is a plum forest ahead, with sweet and sour fruit that can quench our thirst." The soldiers, upon hearing this, all produced water in their mouths, and they were able to reach the source of water. Its ability to generate saliva can be seen. In ancient times, they were harvested and dried in the sun to be made into ebony plums, and they were also considered a top-quality seasoning. The Book of Documents says, "If you make a seasoning, you only use plums," taking advantage of their sourness. During the Ming Dynasty, a small amount of white plum pulp was soaked in snow water, lubricating the flower dew overnight, and then soaked in honey wine. This was called "honey-soaked plum blossoms." There was also plum blossom porridge, which took fallen petals and mixed them into cooked rice porridge, and then cooked it again. There was also a method of melting wax onto half-open flowers, pouring honey into the flower mouth, and after a period of time, taking one or two flowers together with a spoonful of honey and adding them to boiling water to drink, called plum blossom soup. Yang Chengzhai has a phrase about removing the stamens and boiling them into porridge and eating them, and serving dew-covered plum blossoms with honey, which probably refers to this. However, these methods all belong to the literati's fondness for playing with elegance. In recent times, yellow and ripe plums are juiced, and then mixed with perilla and sugar to make plum jam, which does not spoil for years and can be added to bread and other items. In the hot summer, it can also be used as a cold drink. The method is to take two or three spoonfuls of plum jam and mix it with cool boiled water to drink. The sweetness and deliciousness are far superior to the fruit juice sold in the market, and it is also the most hygienic. Perilla disperses wind and cold, relieves the surface, treats summer dampness and diarrhea, stops cholera cramps, and the original intention of creating this method was actually deeply meaningful, but most people do not know it. Because I like plum water, I also like to read plum poems. However, there are very few poets who praise plums throughout the ages. I love Luo Yin's poem "Red Plum": Heaven bestowed rouge, a smear on the cheek, Among the piles, a sad melody in the flute,
Although I have not been able to benefit from it, I have helped generals quench their thirst. Readers, at this point, do you also feel a tantalizing taste?

Spring and Autumn

### Launching Five Types of Social Welfare Enterprises

— Xinan

Recently, Mr. Feng Bingnan prepared to organize a social welfare enterprise association for his mother's birthday, taking out a sum of money as subsidy funds for five categories: educators, news practitioners, religion, unemployed self-help, and health mutual insurance societies. Why did he specify these five types of enterprises first? Without him explaining his intention, there is no way to speculate. However, judging from his usual words and deeds, he is a person full of human sympathy. He often talked with friends, proposing "seeking loyalty for mankind" and "self-help, helping others, mutual help" as conversation topics. He believes that the most admirable people are those who support themselves. Therefore, he said that although the occupation of rickshaw pullers is humble, it is admirable to exchange sweat for money. The most shameful thing is to gain without labor, no matter how powerful he is, his heart and actions are extremely despicable. He believes that the most important responsibility lies with teachers and journalists, which everyone knows and does not need to be said much. However, their lives are also the most meager and the most diligent. Improving their treatment is certainly another issue, depending on their professional abilities. However, society should not ignore their contributions, nor should it only care about enjoying comfort while ignoring the people who truly make great contributions to others. It is too unfair and too cold. Although he knows that it is not easy to handle it well, he believes that what should be done should not be left undone because it is difficult. Therefore, a subsidy fund should be raised to provide some assistance to teachers and journalists who have made outstanding achievements in benefiting society and people. This kind of subsidy is not only a material reward, but also a kind of honorary award. Also, for impoverished journalists who die destitute and need to raise orphans, etc., a little subsidy should also be given. Secondly, he believes that the most painful thing in life is illness. Unless people who are truly well-off can cope, the salaries of most salary earners, no matter how much their income, have already reached the most painful stage of life. Furthermore, with the torment of illness, the physical pain is unbearable, and the mental pain is even more severe. Even without illness, one should prevent illness, and with illness, one should be even more wary. Therefore, he is determined to relieve the suffering of general salary earners from illness, so that they will not be unable to get good medical treatment when they are sick, but will be trapped by illness and become unemployed and bankrupt. He wants to design a good method so that those who join the society can get good medical treatment when they are sick, so as to avoid adding to the oppression of their painful lives. As for the unemployment problem, it occupies the top position in today's social problems, but he believes that solving this problem solely by absorbing people into the industry and relying on other people's relief is costly and ineffective. He advocates self-help and helping others, self-reliance and helping others to stand on their own. Therefore, he believes that solving the unemployment problem should start with mutual assistance among the unemployed, whether it is mutual introduction to jobs or mutual cooperation in a business, to solve their own difficulties.

He also has criticism for us journalists. He said: Why do current newspapers mostly publish news advertisements that promote obscenity and theft? Perhaps it is to cater to social preferences, perhaps it is for business reasons, or perhaps it is thought to have the meaning of warning against evil; but if you don't pay attention, you only see how to steal and how to be obscene, without seeing the consequences of obscenity and theft. He believes that since news about social ills cannot but be published, news about the good aspects of society should be published even more. In particular, it is necessary to advocate justice, distinguish right from wrong, promote learning, and promote morality. News about contemporary good words and deeds, loyalty and righteousness, and heroic deeds should be published more to encourage people to do good. This cannot be said to be the newspaper's partiality, as long as the facts are used to prove it. In personnel news, it is best to publish more about new scientific inventions, new industrial creations, so that people can feel interested in addition to feeling interest, and get an encouragement, so that he can hear the news and rise up, creating a good society. That is the due responsibility of journalists!

The above cannot be said to be the motive behind Mr. Feng Bingnan's handling of this matter, but I only know his intention as far as I have heard and seen. I think his real intention must have a day when he will formally announce it himself. As for the religious subsidy fund, he wants to promote the development of religious doctrines and improve the living forms of general religious believers, so that they will be beneficial to society, instead of taking profits from society.

### Amateur Chat – The Marriage Problem of White Waves

— Shi Wei

Before our society enters rationality, society itself is flawed; therefore, people living in this society will encounter various problems.

Workers are the most difficult group, so they are the first to encounter all kinds of problems.

Today, let's talk about the marriage problem of white waves.

We are not Puritans, we are all people who were born after ten months. We have sexual demands in our physiology. We certainly need a fulfilling sex life.

However, sex life is only a part of a person's entire life. When we are fighting for the entire life today, do we necessarily need to seek the satisfaction of sex life? And can we seek satisfaction? Conversely, we cannot ignore the entire life just for the satisfaction of sex life.

Undeniably, among our young workers, there are many who are desperately pursuing the opposite sex, and most of them have forgotten their careers and delayed their work as a result; we feel that this tendency cannot be allowed to continue to develop. Otherwise, from a small point of view, the individual's future will be a problem. From a large point of view, it is not a blessing for the country and society.

We absolutely support the ideal marriage that develops from the progress of love to marriage. But we oppose the "love supremacy" that requires career to obey love!

History has proven, and there are thousands of people who are experimenting, that we have methods to overcome physiological "sexuality." That is: having the confidence to strive for a career, having good amateur activities to adjust, absorbing correct spiritual food... and so on.

By the way, some people are borrowing from the east and west to prepare for marriage, only seeing the satisfaction in front of them, without considering the life problems after marriage, which is very dangerous. On the one hand, we must try to reduce the cost of the ceremony, and on the other hand, we must ensure that the wife participates in productive work. Otherwise, won't the lively wedding ceremony become a prelude to tragedy?

In addition, we also support those who protest against the family due to dissatisfaction with the marriage by sale. But it should be noted that not every object arranged by parents is not good. We should try our best to strive for the opportunity to study the object, to investigate whether she (he) is good or bad, whether there is potential for development, and her (his) beliefs... and so on.

### Hawthorne's Case – Where the Dancing Queen Ended Up

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two "A Page of History!"

Ni Jinshou's eyes flashed, and although Hawthorne, it seemed to indicate that there was a glimmer of light in this case. Hawthorne ignored him, but reached into his pocket and took out the two photos he had just put in. He pulled out the larger one, folded it up and gave it to Jinmei.

"Is this the person?"

Jinmei raised her eyes slightly, glanced at the photo, and nodded.

Hawthorne said, "What's his name?"

"Gan Tang – Yu Gantang."

Hawthorne put the photo back in his pocket. "Hey, Miss Jiang said that your person was killed by this Yu Gantang. So, did she say any reason?"

"No, she just said she wanted to see you."

Ni Jinshou looked at Hawthorne and asked, "Has the woman named Jiang seen you?"

Hawthorne said, "I've seen her, before you called me. She just asked me to come here to investigate immediately, and never expressed any opinion. But she promised me that we would talk more about other things later."

Ni Jinshou nodded. "That's good, we can ask her directly in a while."

Hawthorne did not answer. His eyes were still fixed on the maid's face.

He said again, "Jinmei, in your opinion, does Miss Jiang's words have any meaning?"

Jinmei hesitated again. Her right hand was playing with the buttons below the waist of the wool gabardine cheongsam, unbuttoning it for a while, and buttoning it again for a while.

"I can't say anything. I don't know." (31)
