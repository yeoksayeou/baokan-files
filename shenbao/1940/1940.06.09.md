Editorial

### The Islamic World Group and the Future of the European War

The mystery of Italy's participation in the war remains to be revealed, while the extreme tension in the Mediterranean situation is clearly visible. Although the US President and the Roman Pope have both made their utmost efforts to limit the expansion of the war and prevent it from spreading to the southeastern half of Europe, the rulers of the three major players, Britain, France and Italy, remain extremely estranged from each other. All diplomatic expressions and movements are overshadowed by active military preparations. If Italy jumps into the whirlpool of war one day, helping Germany to attack Britain and France, the European war is bound to expand and take place on two battlefields, east and west. In the west, Germany and Britain and France will be the main players, fighting for hegemony over the continent, while in the east, Italy and Britain and France will be the main players, fighting for control of the Balkans, the eastern Mediterranean, West Asia and North Africa. West Asia and North Africa, which the world calls the Islamic World Group, are located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia and are essential for military operations, and their importance is increased all the more at this time of war. What is the relationship of these countries to the overall international situation, and what are their current positions and movements? It is worth analyzing.

First, in terms of transportation, the Suez Canal is the eastern gateway to the Mediterranean, and Aden is the eastern gateway to the Red Sea. Britain must consolidate transportation in the Mediterranean and Red Seas in order to obtain resources from its eastern territories (India, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, etc.), but Italy's connection with its East African colonies also relies on the Suez and Red Seas. The two cannot coexist, which is one of the fundamental reasons for the conflict between Britain and Italy. Second, in terms of economics, the Islamic World Group is a producer of wool, cotton, tobacco, livestock, and copper, lead, tin, manganese, zinc, potassium, coal, etc., which are all sought after by Britain, France, Germany and Italy. What is especially important is that the oil produced in West Asia is almost the lifeline of Britain and France. In 1938, 25% of Britain's total oil imports came from Iran and Iraq, while in the same year, 41% of France's total oil imports came from Iran and Iraq; since the outbreak of the European war, this number has increased even more. Third, since the importance of the Islamic World Group in transportation and economy is so great, its military importance is not difficult to imagine, because military, transportation and economy are closely linked. Moreover, the ports of Alexandria and Port Said in Egypt, the port of Haifa in Palestine, and the port of Beirut in Syria are all major bases for the British and French navies; and Cairo in Egypt, Amman in Jordan, Baghdad in Iraq, and Damascus in Syria are the places where the British and French air forces gather. Therefore, in military terms, West Asia and North Africa are no less than the lungs of the two major colonial empires of Britain and France. If Italy joins the European war, it will inevitably attack this region; if Germany seeks to thoroughly strike Britain and France, it will inevitably seek to control this region by passing through the Balkan Peninsula. Therefore, if the scope of the European war cannot be expanded, the Near East and the Middle East will inevitably become battlefields and areas of intense contention.

Since the end of the First European War, almost the entire Islamic World Group has fallen into the sphere of influence of Britain and France. Egypt is a vassal of Britain, Palestine and Iraq are British mandates, and Syria is a French mandate; in other countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Arabia, British influence is also quite deep. Although the policies of Britain and France towards these colonies and mandates are quite questionable, they are generally enlightened, as evidenced by the successive independence of Iraq and Egypt in 1932 and 1936 with British support. In recent years, Germany and Italy have used the national ideology of Islamic nations to instigate anti-British and anti-French trends in many ways, and have achieved considerable success. The unrest in Palestine and Syria has often revealed the activities of fascist countries' "fifth column" in the area. However, since Italy implemented its aggression against Abyssinia and Albania, and Germany forcibly annexed Austria and the Czech Republic, the Near Eastern Islamic countries not only lost their faith in Germany and Italy, but also feared that the spearhead of aggression would expand further eastward; as a result, while seeking to protect themselves, they promoted long-term progress in their relations with Britain and France. In 1937, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan concluded a treaty of non-aggression against each other; then Turkey and Iran signed an agreement of mutual assistance; and recently it has been rumored that Egypt and Iraq will also join this agreement. This is the Islamic World Group's attempt to protect itself. Egypt and Iraq are allied with Britain, so after Britain and France declared war on Germany last September, Egypt and Iraq immediately severed diplomatic relations with Germany; on October 19, Turkey also signed a mutual assistance convention with Britain and France. Thus, the connection between Britain and France and the Islamic World Group has become closer and more resilient. From this, it can be inferred that even if Italy decisively joins the European war and unites with Germany to invade the east, it will hardly be enough to shake the advantages of Britain and France in West Asia and North Africa; and the countries of the Islamic Group will probably help Britain and France by helping themselves. When the war ends and peace is restored, the status of these countries will rise even further. As for the Soviet Union, it is geographically adjacent to the Islamic World Group, but the Soviet Union's policy is to adhere to neutrality and maintain the status quo of small and weak neighbors as a buffer, and it is conceivable that it will not collude with Germany and Italy to plot against the Islamic countries.

### Japanese Cotton Textile Industry in Sharp Decline; Seeks to Promote Sales in South America

Osaka: Major Japanese cotton textile exporters held a meeting here this week to discuss the recent dire situation of the Japanese cotton industry. Those present decided that the main tasks that need to be done at present are to request the government to establish a foreign buying and selling committee, managed by non-official experts. They also advocated setting a minimum export price for cotton textiles and striving to increase sales in the South American market, as it is currently regarded by Japanese exporters as the most promising. Textile merchants expressed disappointment with the sterling market, which is the largest customer of Japanese cotton cloth, with the exception of Australia and India. They believe that if import controls in the British Empire are further tightened, most sterling markets will have no place for Japan. They are not worried about Australia, because if Australia cuts off the import of Japanese cotton, Japan can also cut off the import of Australian wool in retaliation. The situation in India is similar, because the country must purchase Japanese cotton cloth so that Japan can purchase its raw cotton. (Reuters Dispatch)

### Fierce Battles Unfold on the Weygand Line: French Troops Retreat to New Positions, German Tank Columns Advance in Two Directions, Placing Significant Pressure on the French Army's Left and Right Flanks

Paris - The General Headquarters announced this morning that enemy tank columns continued to make progress yesterday upstream of the La Bresle River. Their advance units have already reached the outskirts of Fourcilles-les-Essarts (the town is 40 kilometers northeast of Rouen). There were no other changes elsewhere. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)

Paris - Military sources here have stated that the fighting along the line from the coast to the "Avenue of the Ladies" is continuing intensely. Our military authorities are very confident about the future of the battle situation. Because the enemy is advancing on our flanks in two directions, one along the La Bresle River west of the Somme River and the other along the Aisne River east of the Arleux River, we have withdrawn the positions in the central areas of Amiens, Bequin, and Ham in order to straighten the line of defense. In addition, although an enemy tank column penetrated our defensive works yesterday, it did not initially break through our positions and, being isolated, is being cleared by our troops. Our troops are still holding all the strongholds and not allowing enemy infantry to rush in with the tank columns. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)

Paris - According to the latest news, the situation on the front lines is roughly as follows: (1) Fighting is raging from Le Tréport on the coast to Pouilly-sur-Aisne on the Aisne River (note: the canal between the Voisne and Aisne Rivers joins the Aisne River in this town). Pouilly-sur-Aisne is the easternmost point of the front line. (2) The German army has not yet attacked our positions along the Aisne River between Rethel and Attigny, only opening fire with artillery. (3) Yesterday, the enemy attempted to cross the Aisne River east of Soissons but was repelled by our troops after fierce fighting and failed to achieve their goal. As of this morning, our troops are still holding the north bank of the Aisne River north of Soissons. The hilly area between the Aisne and Voisne Rivers has seen renewed fierce fighting since dawn today. (4) Fighting is also taking place on both banks of the Voisne River, especially near the Ourscamp forest and the town of Carlepont (the town is on the south bank of the Voisne River, across from Noyon). (5) The front line between the Voisne and La Bresle Rivers, from 10 to 12 kilometers south of Ham to the La Bresle River, sometimes extends south of this line. In the La Bresle River area, a German tank column has penetrated our positions and advanced 20 to 25 kilometers to the south and southwest. However, this tank column has not been able to hold its gains for long due to the lack of infantry support. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)

German Forces Launch Attacks Along the Entire Front, Unsuccessful Attempt to Force a Crossing of the Aisne River

Paris - Military sources here have stated that fierce fighting has taken place today along the entire front line from the coast to Soissons, similar to yesterday's situation. Although the German army has launched a fierce attack on the French army's left flank, it has not made significant progress. Today is the third day since the start of the German offensive. Although they have used large numbers of tanks followed by infantry, the French army has been able to hold its positions and destroy many enemy tanks, most of which were destroyed by artillery and anti-tank guns, and some by aircraft. As for the area from the coast to Ham (on the upper Somme River), the German army has made no progress as of this evening. However, in the area from the lower reaches of the Voisne and Aisne Rivers to Soissons, the German army has crossed the Arleux River and reached the banks of the Aisne River in certain areas north and east of the city, and attempted to force a crossing of the Aisne River, but failed. In the middle and upper reaches of the Aisne River, in the area of Rethel and Attigny, German artillery heavily bombarded French positions this afternoon, indicating that a large-scale German offensive along the Aisne River is quite possible. In addition, French aircraft have been very successful in bombing the German rear. (Havas dispatch of the 7th)

Paris - The French General Headquarters issued a communiqué last night stating that fierce fighting continued all day yesterday between the coast and the "Avenue of the Ladies." The enemy disregarded casualties and regrouped large forces to attack along the entire front. Our troops are resisting fiercely. Our forward units, fulfilling their mission of countering enemy tanks and infantry, have withdrawn according to plan. In the area upstream of the Bresle River, enemy armored vehicles penetrated our lines but failed to destroy our strong points and are still being resisted. The enemy has begun heavy bombardment on the Aisne River. East of Soissons, the enemy attempted to force a crossing of the Aisne River, but the enemy forces that penetrated the left bank of the river have been annihilated. Our aircraft continued to bomb and strafe, harassing the enemy, and have dropped over 100 tons of bombs on enemy tank convoys and lines of communication in the past 24 hours.

German Forces Penetrate Fourteen Miles Upstream of the La Bresle Canal

Paris - Yesterday morning, French forces north of Soissons continued to hold the north bank of the Aisne River. Fighting on the ridges and in the forests between the Aisne and Voisne Rivers was extremely intense. Tank battles extended to both banks of the Voisne River, with particularly fierce fighting in the Carlepont area across from Noyon on the north bank of the Voisne River. The German army does not seem to be making as much of an effort in the Voisne River area as in other theaters. Fighting from the Voisne River sometimes reaches deep into the south. In the area upstream of the La Bresle River, German armored vehicle units penetrated French rear areas to a depth of 12 to 14 miles. This force is composed of a combination of armored vehicles and infantry, and its strength is not yet known. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

Paris - A military spokesman said that it is estimated that the German army has used two-thirds of its total armored vehicle forces in the battle, but French infantry is still able to firmly hold its ground to resist them. French infantry, under heavy artillery fire and bombing, has continued to hold its positions and strongholds for four days, repeatedly repelling enemy tank and infantry attacks. After receiving orders to retreat to new strongholds, the French army began an orderly retreat and has now moved to new positions. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

Germany Acknowledges the Strength of the Weygand Line, Blitzkrieg Encounters Resilient Resistance

Berlin - The German High Command declared, "The battles in northern France are proceeding according to plan." However, the spokesman declined to announce the details. It has been admitted that the strength of the French resistance has exceeded German expectations. Officials said that although the Weygand Line was hastily fortified, the German blitzkrieg tactics have therefore encountered a "real problem." Military sources said that the fall of Paris is "a matter of days." (International News Service dispatch of the 8th)

Berlin - German military experts, in talks with Havas reporters, supplemented the German High Command's communiqué issued yesterday, stating that our army continued to make progress on the second day of the new offensive. The enemy's defense of the Weygand Line was ineffective. Our army has now advanced to the battlefields captured in 1914. The enemy counterattacked with large numbers of tanks but was repelled by our army with the assistance of the air force. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)

### German War Report

Hitler - German forces are making rapid progress in the areas south of the Somme and Aisne Rivers. Enemy forces south of the Somme have been forced to retreat. The elite of the German Air Force has also been mobilized to assist in bombing heavily populated areas, infantry, and artillery strongholds. 80,000 prisoners were taken in the Dunkirk battle. German aircraft reconnoitered the southeastern coasts of England, and several ports and airfields in Dover were bombed. Near Narvik, a concentration of enemy tanks was bombed and set on fire by German aircraft. Two more heavy bombs hit an enemy cruiser. Near the northwest coast of Ireland, a German submarine sank an enemy auxiliary cruiser (14,000 tons). Enemy air forces attacked German territory late at night, suffering minimal losses. Only one residential area was hit by bombs, killing ten civilians. In total, the Allies lost 71 aircraft yesterday, of which 29 were destroyed in air combat, 15 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the remainder were destroyed on the ground or in airfields. Only five German aircraft are missing. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)

### German Aircraft Raid Eight Counties in England at Night, Material Damage is Minimal

London - Air raid alerts were issued in eight counties in England yesterday, as several German aircraft hovered over British territory for 24 hours. According to an announcement by the British Air Ministry last night, one German aircraft was destroyed and some buildings were damaged in yesterday's German night raid, but there were no casualties. Although alerts were issued in eight counties when German aircraft flew to the coastal city in the southeast, the material damage was minimal because all residents had taken shelter in air raid shelters after the alerts were issued. Only one town was strafed by German aircraft with machine guns. A loud explosion was heard in Norfolk. A German aircraft crashed in Suffolk. German aircraft activity in England has now intensified, indicating that there will be more intense bombing in the future. This activity by German aircraft is intended to disrupt British air force, naval, and commercial traffic, and is also a retaliation for the recent heavy bombing of Germany by British aircraft. The German bomber that crashed in Suffolk destroyed one building and caused minor damage to other buildings. Two of the airmen in the German aircraft were killed and one was injured. According to news received last night, when German aircraft flew over Norfolk, they flew very high, resembling giant crows, and then flew low, dropping many large bombs on their targets. The air raid alert in Norfolk lasted for 50 minutes. The other counties attacked were Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)

London - A joint communiqué from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security stated that enemy aircraft flew over our coast last night and this morning, dropping some bombs, but the damage to our side was minimal and no casualties were reported. A German aircraft hovered over a town on the southeastern coast for ten minutes, strafing everyone and everything it saw with machine guns. A lifeboat that was searching for a missing small boat was strafed by the aircraft, and the roofs and chimneys were also hit by gunfire. Several people were talking on a street when they were illuminated by the headlights of a passing car and were also strafed by the German aircraft. Three of them quickly took cover on the sidewalk, while the others scattered and fled, but none were injured. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

### United States to Further Aid Allied Nations, Roosevelt Asks Congress to Pass Laws, Allowing the Resale of Old Cannons and Aircraft to Great Britain and France

Washington - President Roosevelt recently disclosed that he is requesting Congress to pass laws to allow the government to return old cannons to manufacturers for resale to the Allied nations. This procedure will be the same as the procedure taken by the Navy Department regarding surplus aircraft, and it is expected that some aircraft will be sold to manufacturers for resale to the Allied nations, such as the Navy aircraft sold to the Curtiss Company. New aircraft will not be transferred in this way, but "these new aircraft can quickly become obsolete." For example, Navy bombers recently manufactured are not armored or have self-sealing fuel tanks, so they are already obsolete. He heard that the authorities are also preparing to sell a large amount of ammunition. According to the US Navy Department's plan, the Allied nations will be able to immediately obtain a total of 200 aircraft. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

Washington - Although officials claim to have no knowledge of the news received in Washington from various sources, a large number of Army and Navy aircraft are flying eastward. These aircraft have apparently become "obsolete" overnight, like old cars from last year, and are being sold at a discount. However, what is strange is that these aircraft sold at a discount can only be purchased by the Allied nations. President Roosevelt's statement to newspaper reporters yesterday that "current aircraft can easily become obsolete" caused general laughter, indicating that no one is misunderstanding what is happening. Now that the discounted sales system has been established, it can obviously be expanded to a very wide range, including most military supplies. This method of aiding the Allied nations has now gained widespread public praise. The exact number of fully assembled aircraft ready to fly across the Atlantic is being kept strictly secret, but the minimum estimate is 1,000. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

Washington - It is reported that the US government is planning to sell more than 500 Army and Navy aircraft, as well as a large amount of military equipment, to the Allied nations. The military equipment includes 600,000 Lee-Enfield rifles and ammunition, as well as 500 75mm cannons. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

(United Press dispatch of the 8th)

However, Washington has doubts as to whether Sweden will approve the Allied nations' proposal. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

New York - The British and French Purchasing Commission announced yesterday that Great Britain and France have ordered several high-speed seaplanes from American manufacturers, at a cost of US$4 million. The commission has previously ordered 8,000 aircraft in the United States, and 2,000 have already been delivered. According to news from Washington, the British and French Purchasing Commission is now trying to request the United States to deliver goods originally intended for other neutral countries to Great Britain and France for use first.

If we allow the light of Christian faith to be extinguished by evil forces, or if we allow our freedom to succumb to Nazi violence, then every fortress in Canada must become another Calais, and every port must become a Dunkirk. I say this from the bottom of my heart, and it is what the people of the country want to say. Until now, the world's attention has been focused on Germany, but the next act will see war on a new stage, with countries that have hitherto avoided war in conflict with each other. If there are new enemies confronting us, or if old friends rise up to assist us, it can be asserted that new and old friends will all rise up to help us." (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

### Participation in the War Almost Inevitable: Italian Troops Concentrated in East Africa; Conflicts on the Abyssinian Border; Rumor of King Haile Selassie Leading Troops Back to the Country

Rome, [Date missing] evening – It is believed here that Italy's participation in the European war is almost inevitable. Authoritative sources report that British and Italian troops are concentrated on the borders of Kenya and Abyssinia and have engaged in conflicts. It is further stated that former Abyssinian King Haile Selassie, or his subordinate generals, are currently leading 8,000 troops to develop Abyssinia. It is unconfirmed whether the King is in Africa. News from London indicates that he is still residing in Bath. Reportedly, 20,000 Italian troops are concentrated on the Abyssinian border, mostly composed of Eritrean and Somali Askari natives from Eritrea and Somalia, Libyan camel corps, and Abyssinian cavalry. It is said that the cavalry is led by enemies of the King. The Abyssinian troops in Kenya may be remnants of the King's old army, having fled across the Abyssinian border in the spring of 1936. They are now concentrated near Oyer-Kenya in the vicinity of Harrington Fort. Authoritative sources here claim that the King secretly left England and arrived in Kenya via Sudan. It is widely believed that minor conflicts have occurred on the border. General Terpono, Commander-in-Chief of Italian East Africa, was yesterday appointed commander of the southern forces. This is seen as Italy's intention to seize territory, as General Terpono is an overseas troops inspector who recently inspected troops stationed in Libya, Abyssinia, and Dotted-Kenya.

### Milan Newspaper States Italian Policy Will Be to Wage War Against Britain and France to Resolve Territorial Issues

Milan – Newspapers here this morning published key points of Italian policy, including: (1) For eighteen years, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has consistently promoted a policy of peace, aspiring to seek new political methods based on fair policies. (2) Mussolini's policies encountered resistance from Britain and France eighteen years ago, opposing Italy's Mediterranean and Eastern European policies, undermining the Four-Power Pact, rendering the Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935 completely ineffective, and distorting the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Agreement of 1938. (3) When Italians request land to cultivate, they receive the sands of the Sahara. When Italy waged the Abyssinian War, it encountered sanctions, an insult we have not forgotten today. When Britain and France demanded political prices for recognition, Mussolini considered it a humiliation to the nation and refused. (4) Britain and France are fighting Fascism with the aim of destroying Italy's European vision, but a new Europe will still emerge after this bloody struggle. (5) European democracies that despise or hate the Italian people can only be dealt with by force. Italy will fight against the plutocratic politics of Britain and France in order to resolve all territorial issues. (6) The lives of the Italian people are constantly constrained by Britain and France. Now Italy must strive for maritime independence and national freedom. The Rome-Berlin Axis will create a just peace by force. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 8th)

### British Treasury Announces New Regulations on Foreign Trade; Foreign Exchange Under Strict Control

London – The Treasury Department announced that it has taken important steps to continue foreign trade based on statutory exchange rates and to limit the policy of freely trading pounds sterling on the market. Currently, those residing outside the sterling area will not be issued permits to sell their securities in Britain. Goods shipped to the United States and Switzerland must be paid for with pounds sterling purchased from the Foreign Exchange Control Office at the statutory exchange rate, or with US dollars for shipments to the US, or Swiss francs for shipments to Switzerland. As for transactions with other countries outside the sterling area, the same effect can be achieved by expanding payment agreements and special account systems, as this will allow settlements to be made through official channels in pounds sterling at the statutory exchange rate. Previously, payments required for shipping hemp, rubber, tin, whiskey, hides, and diamonds to Belgium, the Belgian Congo, the Netherlands, the Dutch Empire, and South and Central American countries had to be made in certain specified foreign currencies (or pounds sterling could be purchased from the Foreign Exchange Control Office with these currencies). This regulation now does not apply to any countries other than shipments to the US and Switzerland. Other countries within the sterling area have already done this or will do so. This plan will reduce the amount of pounds sterling that can be traded in the foreign exchange market and enable British foreign trade to operate based on the statutory exchange rate for pounds sterling. This measure will also allow Britain and the countries with which it trades to have stable exchange rates and will ensure that the proceeds from exports are in a currency that Britain urgently needs to pay for raw materials, food, and munitions. Trade between Britain and the sterling area, including the British Empire (excluding Canada, Newfoundland, and Hong Kong), Egypt, Sudan, and Iraq, is currently conducted in pounds sterling, so no exchange rate issues arise. Canada has an agreement with Britain that has the effect of a payment agreement. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

London – Regarding the British Treasury's announcement of the new regulations on pounds sterling, Reuters has learned that the statutory exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar has not changed since the outbreak of the war and is not intended to be changed now. Previously, the pound-dollar exchange rate on the market had fallen sharply due to drastic fluctuations. As much of Britain's foreign trade is conducted based on the statutory exchange rate, some of Britain's exports are now sold in pounds sterling based on the unreliable free market. The exchange rate in the free market differs significantly from the statutory exchange rate, resulting in imports being too expensive and exports being too cheap. The Treasury Department's policy aims to ensure that all foreign trade is conducted based on the statutory exchange rate. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

New York Foreign Exchange Market: Pound Price Fluctuates Greatly

New York – The exchange rate for the pound sterling in the New York foreign exchange market fluctuated greatly today. The pound opened at 3.52 and closed at 3.82, with a high of 3.8725 and a low of 3.35 for the day. When news of the new British export exchange regulations arrived, the pound initially fell to 3.48. Later, it was learned that the new controls did not prohibit foreigners or British subjects from using their pound balances for various purposes and did not prohibit foreigners from holding pounds in London, so the price rebounded by two cents. For example, pounds sterling, except those sold by the Bank of England, can be used to pay for various expenses in Britain. However, the supply of pounds sterling in the market has decreased, so transactions outside the Bank of England will all be small. At that time, the price of the French franc also rebounded, with yesterday's closing price being 2.09 and today's being 2.165. According to traders, the effect of the new regulations on pounds sterling is that Britain can obtain more US dollars and reduce the possibility of speculation, which has been widely criticized in London recently. Today's foreign exchange market caused those lacking positions to rush to buy, and merchants needing to pay for goods in pounds sterling also hurriedly purchased what they needed from several banks. In theory, the new regulations have prevented the continued increase in pound balances, but a huge balance remains that can be sold to those willing to hold balances in London in exchange for US dollars or other currencies. At the same time, well-informed sources indicate that no one can comment on the current size of pound balances, as it is unknown whether London actually has a surplus of pounds held by foreigners or a shortage. Assuming that the world's pound balances are still large, if this money cannot be used to pay for British goods, then a large number of pounds sterling will be sold at prices below the statutory exchange rate. However, theoretically, the demand for these pounds will be limited. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### A Chorus of "Neutrality" at the Beginning of the European War (3)

— Uncle Di

(3) Turkey's Attitude

(September 17th, London)

After Romania declared "neutrality," the disappointment on the British and French sides is not difficult to imagine. As a result, the widely rumored plan for French troops to land on the Black Sea and support Poland through Romania completely lost the possibility of implementation.

The next country worth noting is Turkey, which has an alliance with Britain and France. When the German-Polish war broke out, and on the eve of Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany, its relationship with Britain and France was roughly equivalent to the relationship between Britain and Poland before the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. It was an alliance, but there was no further military understanding. However, there was only one difference between these two alliances: the British-Polish alliance was broad and unconditional, while the British-Turkish alliance was geographically limited to the Balkans, the Near East, and Egypt. Moreover, there was a very important tacit understanding as a prerequisite – because the last time Britain and Turkey formed an alliance, it was under the understanding of the Soviet Union, and at the same time, it was determined under the foreknowledge of imminent British-Soviet cooperation; therefore, the prerequisite was that, in the event of British-Soviet hostility or Soviet objection, this alliance could not take effect.

However, on the eve of Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany, the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union was neither hostile nor allied. Then, if "war breaks out, should the British-Turkish alliance be implemented immediately?" This was clearly a major problem placed before the Turkish authorities at the time.

At that time, with the ultimate goal of urging Turkey to join the British and French side in the war, the diplomatic representatives of Britain and France – especially Sir Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen, the current British Ambassador to Turkey – immediately began intense activities, urging the Turkish authorities to reply quickly.

The first response of the Turkish authorities to this urging was silence, silence, and more silence. In this way, about a week passed emptily. Even after I am writing this, we have not obtained reliable information to explain the motives of the Turkish authorities' surprisingly silent attitude at that time. However, based on my personal speculation, at that time, the Turkish authorities apparently had doubts about whether a war between Britain and France and Germany could occur, and whether, if it did occur, it could be prolonged; therefore, they temporarily remained silent to observe the developing situation.

However, on the other hand, we have reliable information to know that while the Turkish authorities were maintaining silence on the relationship between Britain, France, and Germany, they were simultaneously engaging in consultations with the Soviet Union. However – again, contrary to the expectations of general observers at the time, despite the recently signed Soviet-German pact, the advice given by the Soviet Union to Turkey at that time was to "be faithful to the British-Turkish alliance." This means that in the event that Germany and Italy were at war with Britain and France in the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and other regions, Turkey could obtain the non-opposition of the Soviet Union and join the British and French side in joint warfare.

Therefore, after a cabinet meeting after the outbreak of the war, the current Turkish President, İsmet İnönü, immediately met with the British Ambassador and told him Turkey's decision: Turkey has always been "faithful to the peace front and has always stood on the side of Britain and France."

Thus, in Britain at that time, there was a flurry of discussions about the intention of the Soviet Union's move. The majority view was that the Soviet Union's move was to facilitate the prolongation of the British-French war against Germany, because otherwise, without Turkey's cooperation, when Britain and France were under serious threat from Germany and Italy in the Mediterranean, the Balkans, the Near East, Africa, and other regions, they might be eager to seek a hasty end to the war in Europe. Therefore, their conclusion was that the Soviet Union was apparently sitting on the sidelines to watch the tigers fight, in order to brew a "world revolution" at a favorable time in the future.

In any case, Turkey's move at that time greatly benefited Britain and France, or at least benefited the determination and courage of Britain and France to fight?

This caused great resentment and unease on the part of the German authorities towards Turkey, especially towards the Soviet Union.

Therefore, Papen, who was specially sent by Hitler to Turkey to actively engage in activities, had no choice but to return empty-handed.

In conclusion, this diplomatic battle on the Turkish side, with Britain and France on one side and Germany on the other, was a preliminary victory for Britain and France.

### British Labour Party Pledges Full Support to Wartime Government for Ultimate Victory

London Dispatch: The most noteworthy political development of this current crisis is the change in the Labour Party's policy in Britain. Except for a brief period before 1931 when it held power, the Labour Party has always been in opposition to the government, constantly criticizing it. However, since the outbreak of the European War last September, the Labour Party has been extremely

supportive of the government's war policies, fostering a spirit of national unity. Even when the party still had criticisms of the government, their main aim was to urge the government to fully implement its war policies. This continued until May 4th, when Germany invaded Holland and Belgium, at which point the Labour Party began to criticize the government's war strategy again, especially regarding the Norwegian campaign. This led to a cabinet reshuffle. After the new cabinet was formed, the Labour Party, along with other parties, fully cooperated under the government's leadership, united as one. As a result, the nation was galvanized, and its prestige greatly enhanced. It is worth recalling that during the last Great War, the Labour Party also supported the government, but its method of support was very different from this time. On August 2, 1914, the Labour Party opposed Britain's entry into the war, and on August 6th, their attitude was still extremely cautious. In 1915, they authorized Mr. Henderson to join the coalition government, but the party immediately became divided internally, and its attitude inevitably remained at odds with the government. Various labor unions, in particular, expressed dissatisfaction, and there were frequent strikes. Today, however, union activities are all guided by war policy. Mr. Annas Bowin and other leaders have pledged the full support of the unions to strive for

ultimate victory. The party held a meeting in Bournemouth and passed a resolution by a majority vote to join Churchill's new cabinet. Currently, Labour ministers in the new cabinet do not intend to implement policies specific to their party during this wartime period. The social policies discussed at the Bournemouth meeting will be temporarily shelved. However, matters that are not solely related to one party will be brought to the attention of other parties for joint effort and implementation. For example, the Labour Party's declaration states the need to find ways to adjust wartime life to make it resemble peacetime life as much as possible. This strategy should not be overlooked by the wartime government. Now that the Labour Party has proposed it, it should be easy for all parties to implement and achieve effective results.

### International Track and Field Games Close: Chinese Athletic Association (CAA) Takes Third Place, Western Police Win Championship, Western Youth Runners-Up, Li Zhenzhong Wins Two Gold Medals

The Sino-Western Team Track and Field Games, organized by the Shanghai International Track and Field Association, concluded yesterday with the finals. The Western Police team, with its well-rounded talent, won the championship with 60 points. Western Youth came in second with 45 points, and the Chinese Athletic Association (CAA) took third place with 29.5 points. Following them were the Dongseile School and the Joint Schools team. During this extremely difficult period, the CAA team's achievement is truly commendable. The Games closed yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, with two new meet records being set in the long jump and the 880-yard relay.

The individual star was Mandolis of Western Youth, who won three gold medals and two silver medals. Close behind was Fonseca of Western Police, who won three gold medals and one silver medal. Li Zhenzhong's victory in both the hurdles and the high jump yesterday was particularly commendable, and his results were very good. Wang Zhenglin's defeat in the two-mile race was a surprise to many. The relatively unknown Di Mike clung to Wang tenaciously and then surged ahead with a burst of speed in the final 200 yards. Wang seemed to be in poor physical condition yesterday; it is said that he was stepped on by a spiked shoe in the third lap and endured the pain to finish the race. The pole vault and 880-yard relay results were excellent. The CAA team's weakness was its lack of talent in the short sprints, which led to a complete rout and prevented them from placing in either relay race. Otherwise, their performance would have been even more impressive.

### Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Improves Wartime Local and Primary Social Education (1): Restoring Educational Administrative Institutions in Occupied Counties

(Suzhou North Communication) What progress has been made in local education, primary education, and social education in Suzhou North during this period of resistance? Over the years, there has been a lack of statistics to indicate this. I have recently obtained from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education the latest statistics on various aspects of education and am writing them down for the reference of those studying wartime education. (A) There are 4,048 public and private schools in Suzhou North, with 6,011 classes, 6,266 teachers, and 238,879 students (excluding provincial primary schools). (B) There are 12,451 private schools, with 229,696 students. (C) Social education (based on institutions) includes schools running concurrently with civil schools, as well as specially established civil schools, wartime mobile schools, libraries, gymnasiums, experimental farmers' education centers, etc., totaling 166 units. Under the planning, supervision, and promotion of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, the education of various counties this year has gradually recovered from devastation and is becoming more substantial. The compilation of various statistics is currently underway. According to the reports submitted by various counties this year, the number of primary schools approved to be established is 2,560, with 4,449 classes and 1,506 compulsory education classes, totaling 4,066 schools and 5,955 classes. Provincial and private primary schools are not included. Comparing these figures with those of the previous year, an increase can be seen. The following is a brief account of the recent measures for local education, primary education, and social education in Suzhou North, based on the findings of the investigation:

A. Local and Primary Education

(1) Strengthening educational administrative institutions in various counties. In counties that have been occupied, the post-disaster situation is gradually stabilizing. If the educational administrative organizations in counties such as Lianshui and Funing are not restored as soon as possible, it will not be sufficient to coordinate the progress of local education and gradually restore education throughout the county. In addition to restoring the Lianshui Education Bureau and appointing a director, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education is also in the process of restoring the Education Bureau of Funing County. For counties where the situation has not yet reached the point of restoring the Education Bureau, the number of education committees will be increased based on local conditions to strengthen administrative power and facilitate measures.

(2) Establishing Examination and Appointment Committees for Educational Institutions Personnel in Various Counties. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education established Examination and Appointment Committees for Educational Institutions Personnel in Various Counties within the department this year. The purpose is to openly and carefully select personnel for educational institutions in various counties, thereby improving the effectiveness of education. In the future, when submitting applications for the approval and appointment of directors of county education bureaus, county supervisors, education committee members, principals of county middle schools, and heads of county social education institutions, in addition to handling the various qualifications in accordance with regulations, they must pass the examination and be qualified before they can be approved and appointed. Education bureau directors directly nominated by the department for appointment must also go through the examination procedure first. Since the establishment of this committee, the appointment of personnel for educational institutions in various counties has been handled in accordance with the prescribed methods. This is indeed a method of carefully selecting talent and openly employing personnel, sweeping away the previous practice of letter recommendations. The intention is indeed commendable.

(3) Adjusting Provincial Primary Schools. It is found that Suzhou North originally had no less than ten provincial primary schools, including the attached primary schools of Provincial Huaishi, Haishi, Rushi, Shihuxiangshi, Caoyanxiangshi, Jieshouxiangshi, as well as Guanyun Lucun Nantong Xuzhou Primary Schools. By the second half of the 27th year, the attached primary schools of Provincial Rushi, Nantong Primary School, and Xuzhou Primary School were suspended due to the impact of the war. In the spring of the 28th year, with the fall of Huaihai, the attached primary schools of Haishi and Shihuxiangshi, as well as Guanyun Primary School, were also suspended one after another.

### Methods for Provinces to Imitate and Print Zhengzhong Textbooks

(Chongqing, 8th) The Zhengzhong Book Company has recently offered the copyright of all its textbooks to the government, allowing provincial and municipal education departments to imitate and print them locally in order to alleviate the textbook shortage. The methods for imitation and printing are excerpted as follows: (1) Textbooks whose titles are not listed in the detailed list may not be imitated or printed under any circumstances. (2) Provinces and cities imitating and printing Zhengzhong textbooks should be managed by the education department or the social affairs bureau. Primary school textbooks may be handled by the county government designated by the education department. No other institutions or merchants may imitate or print them under any circumstances. (3) Provinces and cities imitating and printing Zhengzhong textbooks should be directly distributed by the educational administrative authorities to schools for students to purchase and use, and should not be sold in the market.

### Education Briefs

The Ministry of Education has again ordered all schools across the country to pay attention to students' health and will send personnel to inspect at any time.

Shen Xingwu, the current professor at Jinan University, was tragically murdered. It is reported that the educational authorities in this city have reported the circumstances to the Ministry of Education, requesting preferential compensation (Xinhua News Agency).

In order to improve the work of various teacher service groups, the Ministry of Education convened the heads of various service groups in Chongqing, from May 20th to 24th, for a five-day meeting. A total of more than 30 proposals were submitted. The meeting also sent a telegram to President Lin and Chairman to express respect, to comfort the officers and soldiers fighting in the Henan-Hubei battle, and to comfort the education personnel serving in the war zones.

### Total Scores of Each Team

(1) Western Police 60

(2) Western Youth 45

(3) Chinese Athletic Association (CAA) 29.5

(4) Dongseile 24

(5) Mailing 22

(6) Joint Schools 18.5

### Italian Ship Conte Verde Abruptly Ordered to Halt Return to Europe: Italy May Immediately Join the European War, Shanghai Fascist Leader Indicates Readiness

Italian mail ships sailing to Europe and the Far East had previously been ordered to suspend voyages. However, vessels already en route were still allowed to continue to their destinations according to the original itinerary. The Italian ship "Conte Verde" had arrived in Shanghai on the 6th. However, according to a New York dispatch yesterday, all Italian ships, regardless of whether they were sailing to South America, North America, Europe, or the Far East, had recently received government orders to proceed to neutral ports for anchorage. While it is impossible to know the Italian government's intentions, these actions are bound to be related to the European war situation and deserve attention. The local Italian shipping company also received orders from the government yesterday to suspend the "Conte Verde," which was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai today, and to keep it in Shanghai temporarily. Details are as follows:

"Conte Verde" Postponed Indefinitely

United Press Shanghai, 8th: The Italian shipping company announced this morning that the ship "Conte Verde" will not be sailing to Hong Kong tomorrow. The ship was originally scheduled to depart tomorrow but has now been ordered to postpone indefinitely. The company's agents here were unable to explain the reason for the postponement. However, news from New York yesterday stated that all Italian ships had been ordered to proceed to neutral ports. It is believed that the order to postpone the "Conte Verde" came from Rome.

Ticket and Cargo Refunds to Be Processed Separately

As of yesterday, the ship's cargo, booked by various passengers, and the tickets that had been sold had not yet been processed for refunds. It is expected that the company will process them separately starting on Monday.

To Be Moved from British Wharf

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the Italian ship "Conte Verde" arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and was originally scheduled to return to Italy starting tomorrow (the 9th). However, the local Italian shipping company suddenly received instructions this morning instructing the ship to halt its voyage and await further orders. Therefore, the "Conte Verde" will postpone its departure tomorrow. The ship is currently docked at the Gung Ho Cheung Wharf and is expected to be moved to another location, as the Gung Ho Cheung Wharf is owned by British merchants. However, this point has not been confirmed this morning. The Italian shipping company stated that it must await orders from Italy.

Jewish Refugees Demand Security Deposits

Approximately 200 European Jewish refugees are demanding the return of US$400 each, as they had deposited US$400 each with the Italian shipping company in Trieste when they departed, in accordance with Shanghai's regulations for Jewish immigrants. According to the local Italian shipping company, the Jewish refugees' deposits will be returned regardless of the situation in Europe.

Ship Anchored Frequently En Route

According to passengers who recently arrived in Shanghai on the ship, before the ship left Europe, the shipping company announced that there would be no more passenger ships sailing to the Far East. Therefore, passengers were both happy to have this last opportunity and fearful that the ship would encounter problems en route. As it turned out, the ship anchored frequently en route, causing considerable panic among the passengers. They were only relieved when they finally arrived safely in Shanghai.

Coastal Ships Operate as Usual

Regarding Italian merchant ships operating within Chinese territorial waters, it was learned from shipping industry sources that as of yesterday, the companies had not received any orders from the consulate. Therefore, the ships are still operating as usual. The Italian merchant ship "Deping," owned by the Sino-Italian Company, arrived in Shanghai from Zhenhai on the 7th and is scheduled to continue to Zhenhai at 4:00 PM today. The company's ships "Ende" and "Engel" entered the Nanshi Shipyard last week for annual repairs and have not yet been completed. The Italian merchant ship "Liri," owned by the Italian Hua Yang Company, operates on the Wenzhou route and is currently unloading cargo in Wenzhou. It will take some time to return to Shanghai.

Italian Party Leader Expresses Stance

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the reaction of the Italian community in Shanghai if Italy joins the European war is noteworthy. Regarding this point, a reporter recently asked Sorcio, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Italian Fascist Party. He replied, "We are awaiting instructions. In the meantime, we continue to conduct business quietly. Beyond that, I have no comment on the overall situation."

Egyptian Envoy to Japan Observes European War

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the newly appointed Egyptian Minister to Japan, Bey, arrived in Shanghai on the Italian ship "Conte Verde" on Thursday en route to his new post in Japan. He stayed briefly, and a reporter interviewed him. He said that if Italy joins the European war, Egypt would be in great danger, as the Suez Canal would be closed at that time, severing the connection between Italy and Abyssinia.

The only route

to Abyssinia is through Egypt. Currently, there are approximately 20,000 Italian expatriates living in Egypt, and the Italian colony of Libya borders Egypt. Britain and Egypt have a mutual assistance agreement. While Egypt cannot send troops to assist in the war, it can supply Britain with provisions. Apart from this mutual assistance agreement, there are no other political agreements between Britain and Egypt. Egypt has a constitutional monarch

ruling

independently, with a population of 16 million. Cotton is its main export, and Japan imports a great deal of cotton from Egypt and supplies Egypt with textiles. Bey was originally the Minister to the Netherlands and was transferred to Japan this March. He said that if Germany had invaded the Netherlands last September, it could have driven straight in with very little resistance. However, after September, the Netherlands had 500,000 trained soldiers and had flooded the polders in an attempt to resist, but ultimately

could not avoid falling. Currently, the Dutch are in a dire situation and are to be pitied. There are approximately 20 Egyptian expatriates in Shanghai who have long advocated for the establishment of an Egyptian consulate in Shanghai. It is currently being planned, and if the plan is realized, the consulate will be established soon. Currently, Egypt does not have a diplomatic representative stationed in China, and all its affairs are handled by the British government. Bey is visiting the East for the first time and is scheduled to depart for Japan on the President Cleveland tomorrow (the 9th).

Fifth Column

Last night, Norwegian expatriate Mr. Ponson gave his third speech at the French broadcasting station exposing German ambitions and propaganda efforts. The content of his speech was still based on the theories in the works of German Professor Peth. He stated that the activities of the German Fifth Column first came to the world's attention with the German invasion of Norway. The Germans used the Fifth Column to set up radio stations all over the world in order to broadcast Hitler's doctrines. Finally, he also believes that among all cities, Shanghai is also one of the centers of activity for the German Fifth Column.

British Side Denies Buying Coolies

Last week, a Japanese newspaper stirred up ill feelings between Chinese and British people with a report that the British side had conscripted Chinese coolies in Hong Kong to go to Europe to fight. The British authorities in Shanghai have officially denied this. However, yesterday, the Japanese newspaper "Continental News" again published a report that "the British authorities in Shanghai are enticing Chinese coolies to work in Europe within the concession at a price of 30 yuan per person." The British authorities in Shanghai officially denied this again yesterday and denounced it as "entirely fabricated by the Japanese." The Japanese report also stated that "this British measure has not yet been extended to the areas controlled by the Japanese army. If the British were to entice and buy Chinese coolies in these areas, the Japanese would definitely take the necessary measures to arrest the enticed Chinese coolies for verification."

French Community Collecting Clothing, Bedding, and Boots

In view of the expansion of the war zone in northern France and the increasing number of displaced refugees, most of whom have lost their homes and lack clothing, the French community in Shanghai has launched a campaign to collect clothing and daily necessities through the Sacred Heart Convent. All types of clothing, bedding, and boots, whether old-fashioned or of the wrong size, are being collected, and French expatriate male and female students are separately canvassing for donations. The French radio station broadcast yesterday, calling on the French community in Shanghai to send donations to the Sacred Heart Convent at 622 Avenue Joffre or to notify them in writing or by telephone, and they will send someone to collect them.

German Community Conducting Broadcast Propaganda

According to the "Millard's Review," the German Nazi organization in Shanghai has recently been distributing various propaganda pamphlets to various sectors. One of the pamphlets is titled "The Warmakers of 1939." The publication states, "An English translation of the German White Book, containing the full text and photocopies of important documents discovered in the Polish Foreign Ministry in Warsaw, will soon be printed in Tokyo." This statement indicates that the Far East Nazi propaganda network is based in Tokyo, and all propaganda publications are sent from Berlin to Tokyo via the Trans-Siberian Railway, and then forwarded to Shanghai for distribution. There is also another pamphlet printed in Berlin being distributed here, making a total of three pamphlets. The pamphlets are rich in content and include maps. According to this week's report, the Nazi propaganda organization will soon begin broadcasting propaganda on the newly established radio station near the Hong'en Hospital on Great West Road. It is said that the station's power is the strongest in Shanghai. The British traitor "Lord Haw-Haw" will also broadcast on the station. He is currently working at a radio station managed by someone.

### Exchange Stabilization Fund Increases Strength, Purchases Over One Million Pounds in Foreign Exchange

Since restricting the supply of foreign exchange on the black market on May 2nd, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has been working to increase the strength of the fund. It is reported that it has purchased over one million pounds in foreign exchange. The original stabilization fund was ten million pounds. According to informal estimates, at least one-third of the fund remains. Now that it has been strengthened, the committee's fund is even more substantial and capable of stabilizing the statutory exchange rate and maintaining the black market exchange rate. Therefore, if the black market exchange rate fluctuates abnormally in the future, it can be used to prevent it. Currently, it seems that the foreign exchange bulls in the market have completely disappeared. There may still be a considerable amount of short positions in June. Not only are speculators inclined to sell, but those who have US dollars are also wanting to exchange them for legal tender.

According to news from the banking community in Shanghai, since the outbreak of the European war, Hong Kong capital has been returning to mainland China in large quantities. It is estimated that the total amount of capital returned is as high as 450 million yuan, of which 200 million yuan flowed into Shanghai, 130 million yuan flowed into Sichuan, and approximately 120 million yuan flowed into Kunming and Guiyang. The total amount of capital flowing into Shanghai is roughly equivalent to that flowing into Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. In addition, the islands of Southeast Asia, such as the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, are the places where overseas Chinese gather. Since the outbreak of the European war, a large amount of capital has also returned to Shanghai and the southwestern provinces, and the amount is also huge.

### President Cleveland Arrives

The US President Lines ship, President Cleveland, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Little Luzon via Hong Kong, after a half-hour delay. It was originally scheduled to arrive at 3:30 PM but was changed to 4:00 PM. Passengers disembarked at around 5:00 PM. The ship will depart from Shanghai at 10:00 PM tonight. The last ferry for passengers will depart from the Customs Wharf at 9:00 PM tonight. The Java Mail Line's new ship, Chizalinka, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 10th) at noon from Surabaya via Little Luzon, Hong Kong, and Xiamen. It will stay in Shanghai for three days and depart from Shanghai on the 13th, returning to Surabaya via the original route.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Concerns Himself with Rice Shortage in Eastern Zhejiang, Orders the Four Banks Joint Treasury to Lend an Additional 3 Million Yuan, Requests Exemption from Additional Water Transport Fees on Passage Certificates

The Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association held a fundraising rally for cheap rice sales in the Ningbo region the day before yesterday. The circumstances of the meeting were reported yesterday. It is now known that a motion was proposed at the meeting to slightly levy an export passage certificate fee in the Ningbo area: 10 yuan per merchant and 5 yuan per other villager. All expressed opposition and requested the association find a way to cancel it to benefit the villagers. The association immediately telegraphed the Sixth District Commissioner Xu and the Yin County Magistrate, requesting prompt cancellation to appease public hopes.

Continuing Rice Transport

It is also known that in addition to the previous transport of cheap rice to Ningbo by the "Glen" ship, the "Dapu" ship will continue to transport rice from Hong Kong, with 10,000 bags allocated to the Ningbo area. An additional 50% water transport fee will be added, aiming to collect 300,000 yuan to be allocated to disaster relief donations. It was originally planned to start collecting the fee on the 6th of this month. However, according to a report from the Datong News Agency, after the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association sent representatives to Ningbo to stop this, the fee has also been cancelled. The association has also scheduled a second fundraising rally for the 22nd of this month, aiming to raise 2 million yuan.

Relief Measures

According to the Shaoxing Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai yesterday, Zhejiang Province Chairman Huang Shaohong, accompanied by Wang Wenhan, Zhu Huiqing, and other important officials, went to inspect the county administration of the four counties of Rui'an, Wenling, etc. last month and also consulted on resolving the entire food problem in Zhejiang Province. It is said that a solution has been planned. It is understood that due to diligent winter cultivation last year, Taizhou's wheat crop is lush and expected to increase production by hundreds of thousands of dan. The new wheat will soon be on the market, and early rice will also be available in a month. As Taizhou has a surplus of rice, the rice price has fallen to more than ten jin per yuan. This time, Chairman Huang personally visited Taizhou and instructed the counties to purchase the surplus rice. In the last month, 70,000 dan were shipped, and in the future, 200,000 dan will be shipped each month to continuously supply the cities and counties of Ningbo and Shaoxing. In addition to the funds allocated by the provincial treasury for purchasing grain, the Four Banks have already advanced 1.5 million yuan. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also issued an electrical instruction ordering the Four Banks Joint Treasury to approve an additional loan of 3 million yuan. Chairman Huang also personally instructed the coastal counties that if smuggled food is discovered, the local county grain office or county government should purchase it at a fixed price, and the entire price will be given to the discoverers as a reward. Smugglers will be severely punished according to the law. With such heavy rewards and strict punishments, the trend of smuggling should be suppressed. As for the surplus grain of large households and rice hoarding by merchants in various counties, the authorities in various counties have also been ordered to forcibly purchase it. Anyone who resists will be punished according to the regulations on hoarding and speculation, sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years, and fined more than three times the value of all possessions. Measures have also been established to severely punish those who manipulate prices and engage in speculation, treating them as disrupting public order.

### Authorities in Both Concessions Study Implementing Unified Rice Market, Price Controls on National Rice Rendered Obstructive, Proposed Abolition, Rice Merchants Forced to Enter Market for Cost Assessment

According to a Pingming News Agency reporter, the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession and the Price Committee of the Public Concession are continuing to study a unified rice market plan to regulate the rice and grain situation. The Price Stabilization Committee intends to abolish the current unfair price control method and implement a new method to promote fair and legitimate transactions in the rice market. They hope that rice merchants will strive to reorganize the normal supply of national rice in Shanghai and make rice prices more reasonable, but they also reserve the right to punish all malpractices in accordance with Consul General’s Order No. 78.

Market Improvement

To improve the rice market on a broader and more formal basis, the measures are as follows: (1) All rice merchants engaged in wholesale business must be forced to join the rice market. (2) All rice market brokers must register in this market and pay a sufficient deposit. (3) All rice merchants must register all rice sales transactions in their store accounts and also record them in a book with stubs, and the pages recorded in the book should be torn off and given to the customers. (4) All wholesale rice trade in this city must be concentrated in this market, and the current system of purchasing at least ten bags at a time must be maintained. (5) Actual sales prices should be posted and announced daily. (6) Statistical tables should be prepared daily, recording rice imports, rice exports, warehouse inventory, and rice market locations.

Cost Assessment

In addition, a central statistics bureau will be organized to register the official prices and shipping costs of various types of foreign rice twice a week, so as to understand the exchange rate and the unloading and warehousing costs in this city, which will facilitate accurate cost assessment. The collection of various statistical materials will also make it easier to monitor the situation and evolution of the rice market, and to compile an objective document for the local press to inform the public of the true situation of the rice market.

### British Ambassador’s Wife Arrives in Shanghai via Hong Kong, British Ambassador Remains in Chongqing

British Ambassador Kerr was originally scheduled to leave Chongqing today (9th) by plane to Hong Kong, then transfer to a British ship to Shanghai. However, according to news obtained by the British Consulate, Ambassador Kerr has recently decided to postpone his trip to Shanghai due to important official business. He will stay in Chongqing for a few more days before deciding on his travel plans. As for the ambassador's wife, she has already arrived in Hong Kong by plane from Chongqing and will soon take a ship to Shanghai. She is expected to arrive in port in two or three days.

### French Concession Remains Unchanged, Tokyo Relieved, Situation No Longer Tense

A special dispatch from Tokyo on June 7th from the North-China Daily News states that the Japanese army and navy authorities are deeply concerned about reports denying that the Shanghai French Concession is planning to be handed over to the American authorities. Therefore, the tense situation in Tokyo caused by rumors of changes in the status of the French Concession has eased.

Japanese Consulate Clarifies Misunderstanding

(Omitted above) In order to clarify these rumors, Consul General Miura visited French Consul General Ougier on the morning of the 7th to inquire about the truth. Ougier stated clearly that these rumors were completely unfounded and that there was no consideration of changing the current status of the French Concession, either now or in the future. He also stated that he fully understood the Japanese position, which attached great importance to maintaining peace and security in the vicinity of Shanghai. Subsequently, Miura visited the American Acting Consul General, Patrick, to inquire about the matter. The American Acting Consul General also completely denied the rumors, stating frankly that they were completely unfounded. According to reports, the rumors of the French Concession being transferred to the American side were originally published in Japanese newspapers, and were not heard of outside.

### Admiral Hart to Inspect Northward Next Week

Of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in Shanghai, only the flagship USS Augusta remains. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai and sail north on the 12th of this month for patrol. Commander-in-Chief Hart himself will board the private yacht USS Isabel after his wife and two daughters leave Shanghai on the President Cleveland this evening to return to the United States and proceed directly to Qingdao. The USS Isabel accompanied the Yangtze River gunboats USS Luzon and USS Guam to Wuhu on May 31 and is expected to return here today. The U.S. Navy vessel Marblehead is scheduled to sail to Shanghai from Manila tomorrow.

According to an urgent telegram received by the shipping industry in Shanghai from Ningbo, Daxie Island, outside Zhenhai Port, was again landed by Japanese warships with troops on the 7th. The tax police team stationed at Benjue Temple on the island bravely resisted separately, fighting fiercely for several hours, and all died heroically. Japanese casualties were also numerous. Currently, the island's self-defense militia is engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. Troops stationed in coastal areas such as Zhenhai, Chuanshan, and Chaiqiao, as well as the river defense forces, are on strict alert.

### Salvation Army Responsible for Relief of Beggars and Refugees in the City, Entrusted by Shanghai Municipal Council and Rotary Club, Concessions Allocate Funds for Indirect Assistance

According to the Continental Daily, representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the Rotary Club, and the Salvation Army held a meeting earlier this week to discuss funding for relief work and requested the Salvation Army to be responsible for caring for the city's beggars and elderly and infirm refugees. Brigadier B. Morris, leader of the Salvation Army in Shanghai, telegraphed the Salvation Army headquarters in London to request approval. This matter has not yet been decided, but it is reported that the Municipal Council has agreed to continuously allocate funds from entertainment donations and French merchant charity lotteries to indirectly assist the Salvation Army. The Rotary Club will also actively participate in fundraising to promote relief work.

Number of Beggars

The Public Concession Police Department counted the number of beggars begging for a living on the roads of the Public Concession south of Suzhou Creek on the 26th, 27th, and 28th of last month, totaling only 2,000 people. According to police sources yesterday (7th), this is an approximate number, and it is believed that there are another 500 beggars in the French Concession. As for the number of beggars in the areas north of Suzhou Creek, no count was taken, but it is estimated that there are at least 4,000 impoverished refugees north of the Huangpu River who do not live in shelters, making a living difficult. According to figures released by the Municipal Council, there are 20,410 refugees in the sixteen shelters south of Suzhou Creek this week.

Degree of Evacuation

According to Brigadier Morris yesterday, it is difficult to reduce the number of refugees to below 10,000, and they will permanently rely on the public in this city for support, as these are all elderly, young, and disabled people. The Salvation Army will take in these elderly, weak, and disabled refugees and beggars in the Dunxin Road shelter according to the new relief plan. The work of dispersing refugees is continuing smoothly. However, after the number of refugees is reduced to below 20,000, the dispersal work will be greatly slowed down, because those who are strong and healthy have already been sent back to their hometowns, and those who remain are mostly elderly and weak, making it difficult to persuade them to leave the shelter.

No Coercion

As for the dispersal of refugees, adults receive a dispersal fee of 15 yuan and travel expenses of 3 yuan, while children receive 10 yuan. Brigadier Morris added that when he met with those who initiated the beggar relief plan on Thursday evening, he strongly opposed the use of coercive measures to accelerate the dispersal of refugees. In fact, Shanghai now has a minor wartime refugee problem. In 1937, there were as many as 275,000 refugees in this city, which has now been reduced to 20,000. A city with such a large population as this city has no difficulty in caring for 20,000 refugees.

Concession Investigation

The Public Concession Police Department investigated the number of beggars in the concession as follows: The average for the three days from May 26th to 28th was 1,190 during the day, including 920 male beggars and 270 female beggars (including 65 with sores or missing limbs, 67 cripples, 80 with children, 152 elderly, and 826 able-bodied). There were 936 beggars at night, including 785 males and 151 females (including 44 with sores or missing limbs, 49 cripples, 53 with children, 25 elderly, and 675 able-bodied). In the area outside the concession, the average for the three days from May 26th to 28th was 72 beggars during the day, including 42 males and 30 females (including 5 with sores or missing limbs, 3 cripples, 15 with children, 8 elderly, and 41 able-bodied). There was an average of 48 at night, including 27 males and 21 females (including 5 with sores or missing limbs, 2 cripples, 15 with children, 6 elderly, and 20 able-bodied).

### Reduce Dragon Boat Festival Expenses to Help Refugees

The Fundraising Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Refugee Relief Association is raising donations to provide for the expenses of refugee relief. Due to high prices, although some young and strong refugees have been relocated, more than 30,000 refugees who are homeless and weak and disabled must be provided with long-term relief. The expenses for food, medicine, and education are still vast. As the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, various circles usually have the custom of giving gifts or holding festive banquets. At this time of difficulty, the association specially appeals to all circles to save these expenses and contribute to the refugees. Donations can be sent to Room 414, Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road, or call 18533, and staff will be dispatched to collect them. Thank-you notes, commemorative badges, etc. will be given separately.

### Puppet Municipal Government Demands Archives and Maps, Bureau Does Not Reply, Fu Xiaoan Publicly Announces Filing Lawsuit with Consular Body

According to the English-language China Press, regarding the matter of "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiaoan demanding from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession the archives and maps stored by the Land Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government, according to sources from the Consular Body, these archives, totaling 312 boxes, were originally handed over to the French Concession by Mayor Yu Hongjun when the Chinese army moved west for preservation. In early 1938, the Municipal Council took out the archives from the French Municipal Council and took over the management. Last year, it was rumored that the Consular Body was asked to hand over these archives, but the Consular Body replied that it knew nothing about it. It was rumored that Fu then consulted with the Municipal Council, and the Bureau reported to the Consular Body, but the Consular Body hoped that the Municipal Council would resolve it themselves.

Self-Resolution

Afterwards, Fu negotiated several times, but the Municipal Council did not respond. It was not until recently that it announced that the Consular Body was discussing the matter. It is rumored that Fu stated that if the Municipal Council did not hand over these archives, he would declare them "invalid." It is also heard that Fu threatened to file a lawsuit with the Consular Court.

The Changde ship of Italian merchant Rochefort Shipping Agency, represented by Jufeng Customs Brokerage and handled by Yuanji Customs Brokerage, returned to Shanghai from Ningbo the day before yesterday (7th) at midnight and entered the Wusongkou. At about 11:00 PM by Customs time, when it reached the Huangpu River in front of the New Customs Wharf, the Japanese ship Huaguo, heading north on the North Sand Line, departed from Anchorage No. 2. The two ships met at that location, heading towards each other. Each sounded its whistle to indicate that it would yield to the west bank, but unexpectedly, both ships yielded towards the west bank. There was a risk of collision at the time. Changde urgently yielded into the river, but in an instant, the two ships grazed each other. The sampan on the Changde's deck was immediately crushed, and the iron plates on the starboard side were also damaged in several places. The damage to the ship's hull was minor. However, the Huaguo ship was made of wood and was smaller in tonnage. It suffered severe damage after the collision, making it unable to depart and suspending its voyage. It has already entered the shipyard for repairs. It is also heard that six passengers fell into the water when the Huaguo was leaving port, two of whom were rescued, while the whereabouts of four are unknown.

### Spy Apprehended in London Had Wandered in Shanghai, Used Fake Checks to Stay at the International Hotel, Traveled Freely in Shanghai, Married Russian Woman, Went from Shanghai to Haiphong to Hong Kong and Flew to London

According to the Shanghai Times, an American named "Dr. Newton" recently used forged checks in Shanghai. The American authorities wanted to arrest him, but he repeatedly evaded capture and went to London, where he was eventually arrested on suspicion of espionage. The details are as follows:

Fraudulently Obtained Passport, Arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines

"Dr. Newton," aged 30, is suspected to be Schunall, a former pharmacist in the U.S. Navy. On February 3 this year, he arrived in Shanghai from Manila. It is reported that he was heavily in debt in Manila, so he fraudulently obtained passport No. 255 and came to Shanghai. He opened a room at the International Hotel and presented a check from the "Mississippi Valley Bank Trust Company of St. Louis, Missouri, USA" for US$5,000 to the International Hotel management as collateral.

Met Russian Woman, Married in Church

He then traveled freely in the city, issued multiple checks, and met a White Russian woman named Lepechieva. He claimed to be a doctor who graduated from an American university. On March 2, they held a wedding ceremony in a church. The U.S. Consulate sent a representative to witness the wedding.

Inspected Check, Immediately Determined It Was Forged

By mid-March, the International Hotel management had become suspicious and presented the check held by Newton to the authorities. Mr. Shields, the prosecutor of the U.S. Court for China, inspected the check and immediately determined that it was forged, because Mr. Shields was from Missouri and knew that there was a "Mississippi Valley Trust Company," but there was no "Mississippi Bank Trust Company."

Searched Everywhere, Unable to Capture

An investigation was launched and it was discovered that Newton had used forged checks to merchants in the city. An arrest warrant was issued on March 21. However, Newton had already received word of it and disappeared at 5:15 AM on March 21, a few hours before the arrest. It was then learned that he had gone to the recruitment office of the French Foreign Legion on Avenue Foch in the city and enlisted. Upon further investigation, the French authorities learned that Newton had arrived in Haiphong, Vietnam. Mr. Shields immediately telegraphed the U.S. Consulate in Haiphong to arrest Newton, but before they could act, Newton had disappeared again.

Originally Russian, Repeatedly Committed Fraud

Last year, a ship captain reported that he had seen Newton in Hong Kong. Mr. Shields again sent a wireless message to the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong, requesting Newton's immediate arrest. However, he had already left Hong Kong for London the day before yesterday. Not long after, he was finally caught in London on suspicion of espionage. According to information received by the U.S. authorities in the city, Newton was originally Russian, but became a naturalized American. He usually used many aliases and had repeatedly committed fraud. Last year, he was deported from the U.S. by the U.S. authorities and voluntarily left the U.S. for Manila on March 20.

### Drought Has Formed, No Sign of Rain in the City

The weather has been dry and rainless recently, and droughts have formed in various places. Although there was a hint of rain the day before yesterday, the weather has become sunny again yesterday. It is extremely difficult to sow rice seedlings, and farmers are worried. A poor autumn harvest is inevitable.

### Doctor Accused of Negligence, Declared Not Guilty, Civil Lawsuit Heard in Immigration Court

Hui Mingzhi, an employee of the New World Company, previously sought treatment at the Shilong Hospital on Rue Amiral Bayle due to illness. The hospital's president, Dr. Bode, and the chief surgeon, Dr. Xie Jiashu, diagnosed him with liver cancer. Dr. Bode performed surgery, but discovered that the liver had completely liquefied and was completely destroyed, resulting in his death. The deceased's wife, Zhu Shuxiang, disagreed and hired lawyers Qian Zheng and others to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing Dr. Bode and Dr. Xie of professional negligence causing death, and also filed a civil lawsuit seeking compensation of 25,151.50 yuan. The case was heard by Judge Liu Yugui for a number of court sessions. Witnesses were summoned, and the hospital's forensic doctor examined and made a report, confirming that liver cancer was a terminal illness. Judge Liu concluded that the two defendants were not at fault and acquitted Dr. Bode and Dr. Xie in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. The civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court.

### Polish Lawyer Accused of Forgery

Gabriel Raks, a Polish lawyer residing at 277 Liaoyang Road, is suspected of forging the seals and signatures of the European Refugee Relocation Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council Medical Department and the owner of a foreign firm at 18 The Bund, Mr. White. After investigation, it was decided to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court according to law. After the court issued a summons, Gabriel was summoned to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Attorney Peng Qixin of the police station prosecuted him for forgery of documents and seals under Articles 210 and 117 of the Criminal Code. After questioning by Judge Meng, he ordered a rescheduling for further questioning.

### Yesterday, Two Students Were Kidnapped in One Day; Kidnappers Used Hired Cars; Both Cars Later Found in Western Shanghai

Yesterday, two kidnapping cases occurred in the two concessions. The kidnapped victims were both young students, one named Yang Litai, and the other's name is unknown. The details are recorded as follows:

Gangsters Lured and Hijacked Xiang Sheng Motors

At around 7:19 yesterday morning, the Changping Road branch of Xiang Sheng Motors in western Shanghai suddenly received a phone call to hire a car to Kang Nao Tu Road (Connaught Road) and Jiao Zhou Road. The manager dispatched driver Shi Shougao, a resident of Chongming, in car number 357 with license plate number 18463. Upon arrival, a man in a long gown boarded the car and ordered the driver to go to Singapore Road. When they arrived there, two people suddenly emerged from the side of the road, holding guns, and blocked the way. They forced the driver out of the car, stripped him of his uniform and hat, and one of the men put them on, disguising himself as the driver. They drove the car towards the area of the extraterritorial roads. The two bandits took the driver Shi Shougao to a nearby remote location to monitor his actions.

Young Student Kidnapped by Bandits

About half an hour later, the two bandits gave him three yuan as money for refreshments, forbidding him to make any noise, and then ordered him to leave. At around 9 o'clock, at the public bus stop on Jiao Zhou Road, a student wearing a light gray suit, with glasses on his nose, about eighteen or nineteen years old, stood alone at the bus stop with several books in his hand. Car number 18463 suddenly drove up and stopped abruptly. Six people jumped out of the car, dressed in various styles of long and short clothing. Without asking any questions, they pulled out guns to intimidate and forced the student into the car, driving towards western Shanghai. Later, passersby called two Chinese constables numbered 2692 and 1719, but the bandits had already sped away and disappeared.

Foreign Woman Reports to the Police Station

At this time, a foreign woman named Li Yili (transliteration), who was waiting for a public bus at Guang Fa, witnessed the details and reported them to the Gordon Road Police Station by phone. Shortly after, the driver, Shi Shougao, also went to the police station to report the incident. However, the student's name was unknown because the incident happened on the side of the road and there was no way to find out. The police station is now waiting for the missing student's family to report to the police station as soon as they receive the news so that the case can be solved as soon as possible. As for the hijacked Xiang Sheng car, it was later found on Avenue Joffre. As of 8:00 p.m., no family member had reported to the police station, it was said.

Another Student Also Kidnapped

On the same day, a kidnapping case also occurred in the French Concession. The kidnapped person was also a student named Yang Litai, who is fifteen years old, from Fujian, and lives in a Western-style house at No. 804 Shan Zhong Road, French Concession. The house is his family's property, and his family is wealthy, which made him a target for bandits. His father was an overseas Chinese in Nanyang and passed away more than three years ago. His mother, Ms. Dong, is forty-one years old, from Yancheng. Yang is a fifth-grade student at Guba Primary School in Guba Apartment on Guba Road. He leaves early and returns late, and a maid is sent to pick him up, which is a common practice. Yesterday, at about 12:14 p.m., Yang finished class and was on his way home.

Forced into a Car and Speeds Away

His family had already sent the maid, Sun Liu (38 years old, from Jiangbei), to the school to pick him up. She accompanied him out, and they hired two rickshaws. When they arrived at the intersection of Pu Shi Road and Shan Zhong Road, a Yunfei car that had been previously hijacked by the bandits, license plate number 12323, stopped by the roadside. Seeing Yang's rickshaw approaching, three bandits jumped out, all wearing black Zhongshan suits on the upper body, yellow shorts on the lower body, and black leather shoes. Two of them pulled out pistols and threatened the rickshaw pullers and the maid. They forced Yang into the car and sped away. The maid returned home and reported the kidnapping to the mistress, who then reported it to the Shanlian Road Police Station in charge, requesting them to investigate the bandits. Later, the car was found on Avenue Kena, it was said.

### Yong Sheng Rice Shop Goes Bankrupt; Assistant Manager Sentenced to a Fine

Yong Sheng Rice Shop, located at No. 7, Lane 466, Tianjin Road, purchased white rice worth more than 48,500 yuan from Li Aidong and others and issued checks. However, the checks could not be cashed when they were due, and Yong Sheng also went bankrupt. Manager Xue Caizhang and Assistant Manager Xu Runlin both fled without a trace. Li and others hired lawyer Wu Linkun to report the case to the Lao Zha Police Station, requesting their arrest. Later, Chinese detective Guo Ruiquan arrested Xu Runlin at No. 1, Lane 163, Avenue La Dou. A savings account book of Xinxin Company with more than 2,000 yuan and 717 yuan in cash were confiscated. He was sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke continued the trial in the Fourth Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Peng Qixin, stated that there were no other developments in the case, which was being adjourned. The defendant Xu Runlin's lawyer, Qian Zheng, stated that the civil part of the case had been settled with the plaintiff, and that the Yong Sheng Rice Shop managed by the defendant was actually bankrupt due to huge losses and financial difficulties, not intentional fraud. He requested the court to grant leniency and impose a lenient sentence. After questioning by Judge Meng, Xu Runlin was sentenced to a fine of 500 yuan, or one day of labor service for every three yuan.

### Punishing Opium Use

Hou Rensheng, a local resident, opened a Guotai Western Tailoring Shop at No. 341 Tongfu Road. He had a chartered car and hollowed out the back cushion of the car to hide opium. On April 23 this year, he put six taels of opium in the chartered car, which was ridden by his apprentice Xue Yanlin, and the car was pulled by the driver Jiang A'er. The car was inspected on Avenue Zhapu and the opium was discovered. At that time, Hou fled, and only Hou's wife, Cao, was arrested and sent to the Special Court for trial. A warrant was issued for the arrest of Hou Yousheng. Now, the Xinzha police officers arrested Hou at the intersection of Qingyun Road and Carter Road and sent him to the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, prosecuted according to law. The defendant hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Tao Wuzhi to defend him in court. Judge Xiao sentenced Hou Yousheng to six months of imprisonment for opium use and a fine of 300 yuan. If the fine is commuted, or labor service is substituted, it will be calculated at three yuan per day.

### All Sectors Deeply Mourn the Death of Shen Xingwu; Mr. Shen Vowed Loyalty to the Country and Supported the War of Resistance; A Request Has Been Submitted to the Central Government for Commendation and Bereavement

Regarding the assassination of university professor Shen Xingwu the day before yesterday, according to the reporter's follow-up, Mr. Shen actually died for patriotism, becoming the first unfortunate person after Liu Zhanen. Before the July 7th Incident, Mr. Shen taught at Peking University and Peking Normal University in Beiping, supporting the War of Resistance with great sincerity, which was also reflected in his writings. After the July 7th Incident, Beiping fell, and the Japanese puppets listed thirteen famous patriotic figures in the education sector of Beiping to be arrested, and Mr. Shen was one of them. Seeing the imminent crisis, Mr. Shen

Left in a Hurry and Came to Shanghai to Temporarily Settle Down, Taking Teaching Positions in Private Shangzhong and Other Schools to Make a Living. Although life was very difficult, his belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance and the inevitable success of nation-building never wavered. When teaching, he always used it to encourage students. When Chen Jicheng, the former principal of Private Shangzhong, was in office, he saw that Mr. Shen had excellent knowledge and qualifications and was deeply trusted by the students of the school. So

He Treated Him with Special Courtesy and Thought of Taking Him for His Own Use. When Chen showed a tendency to betray, Mr. Shen resolutely broke with him. After Chen joined the puppet organization, although the principal had been replaced, Chen was still unwilling to give up and secretly worked hard to preserve his old power. Public opinion severely criticized this. The students in the school were quite uneasy and went on strike once, demanding that the school board reorganize the administrative organization of the school to preserve the school's reputation and to protect the school's future. At the same time, the school's

Teachers with Pure Will

Also Argued that in Order to Preserve Shangzhong, the Internal Affairs of the School Must Be Simplified and Certain Forces Opposed by Society Must Be Completely Withdrawn. Mr. Shen Usually Did Not Intervene in School Affairs Except for Occasionally Expressing Support for the War of Resistance, But Because of His Prestige, He Was Highly Respected by General Teachers and They Had Very Good Feelings for Each Other. Mr. Shen Also Expressed His Approval of This View. Mr. Shen Might

Therefore Be Envied

And Ultimately Could Not Avoid Disaster. It is Said that After Mr. Shen's Death, the Teachers and Staff of the Schools Where He Worked Were Very Sad, and the Students Were Even More Grieved. They Went to His Family to Offer Condolences and Planned to Raise Funds for the Aftermath. The Education Authorities Have Also Telegraphically Requested the Central Government to Give Special Commendation and Provide Generous Bereavement to Comfort the Heroic Spirit and Reassure the Survivors. It is Said that Mr. Shen Left Behind a Wife and a Daughter, and the Family Situation Was Depressed, Which Was Very Pitiful.

### Rickshaw Puller Dies in the Shooting of Ji Tianshou

Ji Tianshou, a Hunan native, 25 years old, residing at No. 41 Yuanchangli, Lane 50 Xuelong Road, French Concession, left his home at 9 p.m. on the 5th of this month and was shot by thugs in Yuanchangli Lane, resulting in death. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that when the murderer fired the shot, rickshaw puller Qian Changru (nearly forty years old, residing in Dakangli, Avenue Conti), a native of Jiangbei, was pulling a rickshaw and passing by the area. He was hit in the abdomen by a stray bullet and fell to the ground. The police sent him to Guangci Hospital, where the doctor performed surgery to remove the bullet and treat him. However, due to his serious injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 4 a.m. yesterday. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the forensic examination office of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. Yesterday, Zhao Changmin, the prosecutor of the Special Second Court, arrived at the site to verify that the deceased died from gunshot wounds. The body was claimed by his family for burial. The murderer will be arrested and brought to justice by the police department. However, because the family was unable to afford the coffin and burial, the Tongren Fuyuan Branch provided a wooden coffin for burial at the cemetery.

### Records of Robberies

At No. 644 Fuzhou Road, four robbers broke in at around 8:45 last night, all holding guns, and threatened and intimidated. As a result, they robbed 400 yuan in national currency and left swaggeringly.

At around 9:30 last night, three bandits came to No. 104 Tongfu Road, two of them holding guns. The victim called for help, and the robbers were unable to search and rob, so they fled in a hurry. As a result, one of the unarmed robbers was caught on the spot by the victim and taken to the police station for investigation.

The Chinese exchange rate for spot goods rose by two yuan, to three hundred and eighty-two yuan (the closing price yesterday was three hundred and eighty yuan). At 9:35, the market was turbulent. The spot US exchange rate opened at twenty-three yuan and twelve point five, a decrease of one yuan and forty-three point seven five compared to yesterday's closing price (yesterday's closing price was twenty-one yuan and sixty-eight point seven five). At 11:30, it was stable. The British exchange rate remained unchanged. The spot US exchange rate tightened again by 0.125 yuan, to twenty-three yuan. The spot Chinese exchange rate rose by two yuan, to three hundred and eighty-four yuan. The spot Japanese exchange rate still had prices but no market. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Tianjin's Trend Was the Same

Tianjin, 8th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened this morning with prices but no market. The British and American exchange rates moved in opposite directions. The spot British exchange rate tightened by 0.0625 yuan, to three pence and three seventy-five. The spot US exchange rate loosened by 0.125 yuan, to five yuan and twelve five. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by one yuan, to one hundred and twelve yuan. The black market price of "Allied Notes" increased by one jiao, to one hundred yuan and five jiao.

### Discount Rate Decreases by Another Five Yuan

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange-drawn notes continued to fall, and the discount rate per thousand yuan has broken into the 100 yuan mark. The fall before the summer solstice was unexpected. This is because the need for speculative cash is decreasing daily. The initial discount rate in the morning was 103 yuan, and the discount received was only 98 yuan. Later, it fell further to 95 yuan. The afternoon was very stable, with a mid-point price of 97.5 yuan, a further decrease of 5 yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association also fell by 1 cent. Both the morning and afternoon markets were quoted at 2.4 cents, it was said.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Slightly After Falling

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The Shanghai red fell, and the British and American gold pounds also fluctuated, eventually continuing to fall by three yuan. The British gold notes did not rise because of the shrinking black market British exchange rate, because generally people are unwilling to buy at high prices. The US gold notes were still selling strongly in the early morning because the British pound price in the New York market continued to be low, once retreating to 17 yuan. Later, the general sentiment that today's exchange rate would turn around slightly, so the public's need increased slightly, and finally it returned to 17.3 yuan, but still fell by 0.45 yuan compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong notes rose by 0.3 yuan with the continued rise in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. The Annam notes also rose by 0.15 yuan. The Canadian notes had a slight supply, and the market price was slightly sluggish. There was no shortage of supply of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes. The former retreated to 1.12 yuan, and the latter fell to 0.94 yuan.

### Short Positions Take Profits and Cover; The Gold Market Falls and Then Frequently Rebounds; The Low Price Was 5,530 Yuan; 300+ Yuan Was Deducted According to the US Exchange Rate Settlement Price

Yesterday's spot Shanghai red black market situation: It fell again following the rise in the US and British exchange rates. Because the market was still good and many people took advantage of the low prices to cover, it rebounded frequently after falling. As a result, it continued to decrease by 145 yuan. If calculated according to the US exchange rate settlement price on the day, 312 yuan was deducted. Looking at the process of the half day, it was strongly deducted by 245 yuan as soon as it opened in the morning, to 5,550 yuan. Later, the securities firms, extra numbers, and retail investors took advantage of the cheap prices to collect as much as possible, and it rose to 5,650 yuan under the buying wind. Unfortunately, the exchange rate was reported to be looser, and another gold firm and a certain bank sold together, and the market sentiment weakened again, falling to 5,530 yuan. As a result, it relied on the maintenance of the money exchange industry and closed at 5,650 yuan, a decrease of 145 yuan compared to the previous day. The market sentiment was even stronger after the close, and it continued to rebound by 40 yuan, and there were transactions at 5,690 yuan. The transaction was very active for half a day, with three thousand ingots of light. The jewelry gold in silver shops was quoted at a small increase of 10 yuan, and the customs gold remained level.

Shanghai Gold Fell Again by 145 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially quoted because the exchange rate continued to rise sharply by more than one jiao, and both the US exchange rate and the black market rate increased. The black market was about to approach the 6 yuan mark, so the market was very tired, and gold firms and others sold at a reduced price. First, a certain gold firm sold 10 taels to banks and other firms, which was 5,500 yuan, a sharp decrease of 245 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, the securities firms suddenly came to buy, and at the same time, a certain money exchange industry also followed suit, but at this time, a certain bank had a floating surplus from the previous day and took the opportunity to sell, so the rebound was still slow. When it rebounded to 5,600 yuan, there were fewer sellers. Soon the price rose by another 50 yuan, and the securities firms entered the gold firm with 30 taels, which was 5,650 yuan. Later, the exchange market still loosened, and it was difficult to stand firm at a high price. The gold firm took advantage of the high price to sell, and the bank still had sales, most of which were short positions. Before long, the father fell miserably by 120 yuan, and the bank sold 20 taels to the securities firms, which was 5,530 yuan. Soon after, the foreign exchange was slightly level, and a certain bank turned from selling to buying, and securities firms, retail investors, and others also bought in, and it rebounded again. When it reached 5,600 yuan, a certain money exchange industry completed its long position. Unfortunately, the securities firms had a very healthy appetite, and the gold firms also entered, and finally felt that the buying was greater than the selling, and the father rebounded to 50 yuan. The banks made each other 20 taels, which was 5,650 yuan as the closing price for noon (the market was even better after the close, and under the urgent demand of the banks, it rebounded again by 40 yuan. Finally, there were no sellers at 5,690 yuan). As a result, it decreased by 145 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 120 yuan for half a day. The selling price of the spot gold of the current gold firm was more than 10 yuan higher than that of the Shanghai Red, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few openings.

Silver and Jewelry Gold Were Quoted at a Small Increase of 10 Yuan

At the beginning, the jewelry gold per tael was still quoted at 590 yuan by Datongxing, but at 9:35 it was quoted at a small increase of 20 yuan, and at 10:30 it rebounded by a large increase of 10 yuan. There was no change after that. As a result, Datongxing changed to quote at 580 yuan, which was the same as the previous price. The purchase price was reduced by about 3 shang yuan by the new company.

### 300 Tons of Coarse White Sugar Opened in the Sugar Market

Yesterday, Taikoo Yanghang opened 300 tons of Dutch coarse white sugar, with each dan priced at US$3.01 according to the C.I.F. example. The association's quota disk was tired first and then firm, and the result was that the rise and fall were mixed. The spot 24 coarse white sugar was initially 69.5 yuan for the local stock goods, and then 70.5 yuan. The foreign stock goods were 69 yuan to 69.5 yuan in the morning and 70 yuan in the afternoon, a slight increase of 0.5 to 0.7 yuan. The re-exported goods initially fell by 1.8 yuan, and then rebounded by 0.7 yuan, 55 yuan to 16 yuan in the morning and 56.5 yuan to 57.5 yuan in the afternoon. Taikoo's car white B mark was 82.5 yuan, a small increase of 0.5 yuan, and H mark car red was 59 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan. Dutch red was still 61 yuan. The factory's snow white was 71 yuan, No. 1 ice was 92.5 yuan, and crystal clear ice was 94 yuan, with no major changes. There were no transactions for domestic sugar. Also, yesterday 1,450 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong and were transferred to Dagu.

### Cotton Yarn: Both the Bulls and the Bears Are Completing Their Positions; The Yarn Price Falls Sharply and Then Rebounds Slightly; The Lowest Price for Shuangma Was 1,060 Yuan

The yarn market started to fall and then leveled off. In fact, it has been falling for days, and the degree of the decline is very deep, which has aroused the offset of general profit-takers. Therefore, the shocking and illusory market price suddenly rebounded. At the same time, the actual needs in South China are still not weak. As a result, new buyers and market players have become active again, but the overseas cotton industry situation is still in a state of wandering.

The current yarn market opened in the morning due to the continued rise in British and American exchange rates and the rise in the US exchange rate. The market sentiment continued to advance with the previous day's imaginary and floating air. The spot price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,140 yuan. Then, because there were few buyers and the long positions were painfully cut, the market plummeted to 1,060 yuan in an instant. But after the falling wind was at its peak, it aroused the offset of short positions, and it suddenly rebounded to 1,135 yuan. In fact, (Monday) the 11th is the Dragon Boat Festival, and the market is closed. For the sake of avoiding risks, loose short positions are directly carried over overnight, so the reverse movement is particularly strong. The statistics for transactions in half a day totaled 1,650 bales. Also, 53 pieces of cotton yarn came from Hong Kong yesterday, and 110 pieces are being transported to Hong Kong today. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:

Fellow Traders: 1,080 Hong Kong: 490

Ningbo: 50 Xiamen: 30

Total: 1,650

### The Cotton Market Remains Sluggish

The trading of local cotton is very quiet. This is because the world is filled with war clouds, the American and Indian cotton markets are sluggish, and the yarn market is very depressed, which has led to a lack of enthusiasm. Therefore, the market is sluggish and lacks momentum.

In other news, the foreign cotton market price and the New York cotton market were more active in the early morning. Later, because of the purchases of spot traders and the offsets of a portion of the short positions, the market situation was firm. As a result, the closing price rose by 7-8 points compared to the previous day. The Indian market situation was very tired, and yesterday it fell by more than 3 rupees, including predictions.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was extremely quiet in all aspects. The same industry generally held a wait-and-see attitude, so the cotton market presented a sluggish state. The factory price of yesterday's cotton market converted at a US exchange rate of 5.75 yuan is as follows:

20 Count American Midling 289.95

Also: Lower Grade 279.90

32 Count: Also 309.30

Also: Lower Grade: 2 9.50

42 Count: Also 323.00

Also: Lower Grade: 3 3.10

A Large Batch of American Cotton Arrived in Shanghai. The American Liner (Warrior), represented by the local Hualun Yanghang, transported 8,950 pieces of cotton from the United States this time. It arrived in Shanghai on the 7th (noon) of the day before yesterday, docked at Qichang Dock in Pudong, and began unloading yesterday.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Imports Uninterrupted, Market Prices Difficult to Ease, Short-Grain Rice Nearing Sixty Yuan

In the past two days, the price of foreign rice has been fluctuating rapidly. Although it rose and fell somewhat stably in the morning, by the afternoon, due to changes in the gold exchange rate and the arrival of order confirmations, a decline of thirty to fifty cents was commonly seen. Yesterday morning, this kind of weak trend continued. The market opened with uncertainty, with more selling than buying. Floating traders were seen dumping prices to sell off their holdings, causing the early market price of No. 2 Saigon rice to fall to 50.05 yuan, and small-milled rice to 49.80 yuan. It wasn't until midday that small rice shops, due to their traditionally weak financial positions, and as the Dragon Boat Festival ended, prepared for the upcoming two-day closure to meet demand, and aggressively entered the market at low prices, that retail sales gradually became active. Subsequently, large-scale purchases by inland rural clients occurred, and floating traders reversed course, buying back in, tightening the situation.

The price of foreign rice yesterday fluctuated inconsistently. In the morning, with the US dollar exchange rate lengthening, buying interest was weak, and many merchants and hoarders sold off their holdings, causing the market to gradually decline by sixty or seventy cents to nearly one yuan. Soon, local merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy, and rumors spread that shipping from Southeast Asia was unreliable, and that prices for Siamese and other origins remained high. Continued orders were not finalized, and the market was subject to competitive buying from various parties, causing prices to rise steadily. For example, small-milled rice, which fell to 49.80 or 49.90 yuan in the early market, recovered to 51.20 yuan at noon, and once rose to 52 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 51.80 yuan in the evening. Although selling prices varied between Western warehouses in Pudong and bank warehouses (Pudong and Puxi differed by one or two jiao, and bank warehouses were one or two jiao more expensive), market prices fluctuated by about two yuan, which was still fifty or sixty cents to nearly one yuan higher than the evening close of the previous day. The forward price for No. 2 Siamese rice for delivery in June was quoted at over one hundred tons, with prices ranging from 59 to 59.10 yuan. Currently, there are 7,000 bags of foreign rice.

According to another report, a large quantity of foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's "Tuck Sang" arrived in Shanghai, carrying 17,252 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession for unloading. Another 595 bags were transferred to Tianjin.

For thick and thin short-grain domestic rice, over 1,000 bags of short-grain rice arrived yesterday via inland ships, but early and late season rice crops continued to be scarce at port. Rumors circulated of off-market transactions, as early and late rice crops were selling well, and holders were firm in their intentions. The situation for short-grain rice was quite different, so selling prices varied. The listed price for old-crop Changbang special high-quality short-grain rice was still 58 or 59 yuan, Chang Kun short-grain rice was 57 or 58 yuan, old stock was around 56 yuan, Qing Si thin rice was 57 yuan, and South Port early rice was 56.23 to 56 yuan, about half a yuan higher.

No glutinous rice arrived yesterday, and the peak selling season has passed, so the market turned quiet, with supply and demand balanced and prices remaining stable. Kaijin Li Special Yuan rice remained at 46 or 47 yuan, Chang Dan White Yuan rice was 45 or 46 yuan, and Jiangbei White Yuan rice was 43 or 44 yuan.

### Japanese Monopolization Continues, Wheat and Flour Also in Difficulty

Flour: Yesterday, being a weekend, the flour market showed no special changes. The price for No. 2 flour mill remained at 13.80 yuan. Due to the holiday, retail transactions in this street were slightly more active, with factories selling about 7,000 bags. Inland flour and recycled flour from old vehicles had buyers but no sellers. Sales to both northern and southern merchants were irregular due to varying customer prices, and no formal transactions took place. At this time, with the supply of new wheat not forthcoming, the future price of flour is in a dilemma, and remains in a stalemate.

Wheat: There were no wheat transactions reported yesterday. However, recently, Japanese factories, taking advantage of the difficulties faced by Chinese merchants in transportation, are actively purchasing wheat from various producing areas at prices of 22 or 23 yuan. Therefore, there have been sporadic private shipments to Shanghai from certain quarters in recent days, but this has not yet been confirmed. Under the controlling force of this special situation, Chinese factories can only patiently await any future surplus. It is reported that the shipment of new wheat from various regions is gradually increasing, and the transportation problem may soon be resolved, but it is unknown how much the future costs and miscellaneous expenses will increase.

### Securities: Public Bonds Mostly Liquidated

In the over-the-counter securities market, the ninth drawing for Type E bonds was held yesterday. The market price, calculated after deducting the value of the winning tickets, was down by eight and a half jiao, now on par with the price of Type C bonds. Most other bonds were slightly softer due to the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, with many investors looking to close out positions.

Bullish positions were slightly liquidated, showing some weakness, but Type D bonds were uniquely up by one jiao as its market price was still one yuan lower than Type C and E bonds. The trend was stable, and trading in the market was still quite lively. Runli, Hongda, and Jiufeng were all bought, either to cover short positions or to increase holdings, but Renchang, Lianyi, and general retail investors sold more actively, causing the market price to fall from high to low. Trading ceased in the afternoon to settle same-day transactions. Half-day turnover was about 400,000 yuan. Prices were slightly better for Type D bonds by one jiao, while others were down by five cents to two jiao, and Type E bonds were down by eight and a half jiao. A brief summary is listed below:

In stock trading, 50 shares of the Silk Industry Bank were traded at a price of 27.5 yuan. Today is the regular Sunday holiday, and there will be an additional holiday on Monday for the Dragon Boat Festival. Trading will resume as usual on Tuesday.

London, July 7 (Friday) report: Today's foreign exchange rates for China and the share prices of British companies in the Far East are all stable, with no ups or downs in the market.

### Wheelock Marden Announces Final Dividend

The British firm Wheelock Marden & Co., Ltd., yesterday decided by the board of directors to pay a final dividend of 5 yuan per share (national currency) for old shares for the year ending March 1940, once this year's shareholders' meeting is held. Including two interim dividends, each paying 3 yuan (national currency), the total annual dividend is 11 yuan (national currency).

The P. Musaeus Rubber Plantations, Limited, managed by German firm Deacons & Co., will pay an interim dividend of 8 cents per share (national currency) for the year ending October 1940, on June 27.

### Oil Market: Japanese Manipulation Causes Sharp Rise in Rapeseed and Soybean Oil Prices, When Will Life's Suffering Ease?

Recently, fluctuations in the oil market have been erratic, entirely due to manipulation. In the past two days, prices have suddenly soared because domestic rapeseed oil is controlled by Japanese merchants, and prices are rising daily. It is reported that the price of rapeseed oil has reached 86 or 87 yuan per dan, leading to a corresponding rise in soybean oil, which had been sluggish. The bullish trend intensified yesterday, as oil merchants and hoarders have secretly transported their goods to inland areas, causing a shortage of supplies in the open market, fueling market sentiment. As a result, market prices surged by three or four yuan compared to the previous day. Total transaction volume was 200 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, with prices opening at 102 yuan, rising to 104 yuan, and closing at 103.5 yuan. Ninety barrels of Bengbu soybean oil were traded at prices ranging from 96 yuan to 100 yuan. Two hundred pieces of Yantai oil were priced at 72.5 yuan, 200 pieces of Qingqi oil at 71 yuan, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil at 70 yuan, and 500 dan of Dayou factory oil at prices ranging from 79 yuan to 80 yuan. Although peanut oil showed tightness, due to different sales channels, the trend was normal. Fifty pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 73.5 yuan, 100 pieces of Yantai oil at 73 yuan, 1,000 cans of another oil at 95 yuan, and 80 barrels of Qingdao oil at prices ranging from 103 yuan to 104.5 yuan. (On the 10th, the Dragon Boat Festival, there was no trading in the miscellaneous grains, oil and oilcake market).

### Silk and Tea: Western Firms' Silk Market Declines

Due to the sharp decline in actual silk sales in New York in May, overseas silk prices are entering a weak period. In this city, the recent continuous increase in foreign exchange rates has invisibly caused silk prices to fall. Currently, Western firms are offering prices in the range of 4,900-5,000 yuan, but silk factories remain firm in their intentions, so there have been no transactions.

Two hundred and sixty-five pieces of tea arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Textiles: New Shipments of Black Cotton Interlining Available

Black cotton interlining has been out of stock for over twenty days, and its exorbitant price has made it difficult to find. This is unprecedented in the textile industry. Tailors who urgently need it have had to purchase small quantities from Yuanchangxing, Huayang, Dechang, and Zhangxiangtai, etc., at higher prices. Buyers are eager for the goods, like rain after a long drought. Due to the high price and scarcity, a substitute made of all-yarn woven imitation black cotton interlining has emerged, but its quality is too poor to replace the real thing. Recently, Yinfengxinji Factory in Pentang Lane has started producing genuine wool-woven black cotton interlining. Due to the high price and scarcity of raw wool, production costs are significantly higher, causing its selling price to skyrocket and not be cheap. Yesterday, several dozen pieces were sold at 4.25 yuan. According to the manager of the factory, Mr. Guo, a large quantity of black wool yarn was purchased last week, enough to supply the city's needs for several months. Half of it is being sold off now, and the other half will be held for future spot sales, with an asking price of 4.4 yuan. Also, 81 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Chinese Clothing Fabric Sales Sluggish, Prices Stable

The prices of woolen fabrics and serge for Chinese-style clothing have been quite high on the wholesale market recently. Therefore, most retail stores have raised their prices. Currently, retail stores selling Chinese-style clothing fabrics are asking at least 3 yuan per foot for any fabric, and 5 or 6 yuan per foot for something slightly better. High-quality all-wool fabrics made in England cost 8 or 9 yuan per foot, an average increase of 20-30% compared to before May 2. Compared to last year's market price, prices have risen by an average of 200%. As a result, actual sales have been sluggish because the cost of living on the isolated island is high, naturally reducing purchasing power, causing the market for various poplins and gown fabrics to become stable.

### Dried Goods: Glutinous Rice Branches Rise Higher and Higher

The market inventory of glutinous rice branches has become increasingly scarce, nearing a complete shortage. It is reported that high-quality goods have reached 400 yuan, an increase of 60-70 yuan compared to before. Other mixed-quality goods have also seen a slight increase, but not by much.

### Metals: Black Iron Billet Prices Decline

After soaring prices in the black iron billet market, sales in various channels became sluggish. However, since recently, due to the weakening of foreign exchange rates and sharp drop in cash values, the prices of various goods have generally decreased, and black iron billets are no exception. The market has softened, with the current price at 1,200 yuan per case (2,000 pounds), although an asking price of 1,250 yuan is sometimes seen. Yesterday, transactions were made with local hot water bottle factories, printing factories, and mirror factories. Merchants from other regions, such as Tianjin and Yantai, also occasionally seek to acquire them. It is reported that the circulation of goods in the current market is still small, and there is no supply and demand imbalance for the time being.

### Huisi Iron Sales Not Weak

Huisi iron trading was quite lively yesterday and the day before, with local can factories making large purchases, and merchants from Yantai and Qingdao also buying actively, boosting market sentiment. The price has not weakened due to the foreign exchange rate, and remains high. Old steel factories are selling at 220 yuan, and new steel factories at 200 yuan. Yesterday's total transaction volume reached over 300 cases.

Weekly Supplement

### The Main Force of Modern Warfare - Public Morale

The first phase of the Sino-Japanese War in Europe has just ended, and the second phase has already begun. News from the front lines fills the newspapers, almost too much to keep up with. In fact, in modern total war, the situation in the rear of the belligerent countries also has a great impact on the future of the war. The New York Times correspondent, Xin Yi, specially investigated public morale in the rear of England, France, and Germany, and wrote a thorough analysis, which our reporter, Zi Hua, translates here for reference.

The rear situations of the belligerent countries of England, France, and Germany have been separated from the front lines for several months. The only direct communication is through bombs in the air and wireless broadcasts. News brought from Berlin to London by people who actually observed the situation there is eagerly sought after, even if it is just a small detail. Even the slightest sound coming from England is being listened to intently by those in Berlin.

Relatively speaking, only the French do not have this kind of curiosity. They only keep their eyes fixed on London, just as nervously as London and Berlin are monitoring each other. However, they live next door to Germany, and the war is right at their doorstep, so in their spare time, they would rather talk about things other than the enemy country. They do not value the internal situation of Germany as much as the British do. They have never harbored the illusion that Germany will collapse on its own.

The Americans still wanted to be clever two months ago, and still wanted to avoid fighting to the death. In the months of waiting before the major battle on the Western Front, they never stopped stepping up their preparations for war, but at the same time, they were foolishly dreaming of two things to escape the terror of large-scale war and bombing.

First, they wanted to use their great naval power and financial resources to intensify the blockade and suffocate the enemy. When an informed foreigner in London saw the formerly elegant old gentlemen transformed into John Bulls ready for battle, not only full of energy but also with a reserved strength to continue their efforts, he couldn't help but exclaim that, fighting like this, Britain would have enough strength to support another long war.

France, however, is more strained, and its unity is not very firm. Although its army is larger than Germany's and its training is also very refined, its manpower is small. The soldiers that Hitler relies on are mostly young men. These young people are full of vigor and easily indoctrinated and driven. The old party members are not as enthusiastic as these newcomers.

The second thing is that Britain expects internal changes in Germany. The French call it an illusion. Most Germans are tired of war. Like the French, they complain, "Two wars in one lifetime are more than enough." But the British forget that war itself is a melting force. Whether they are Nazi Party members or anti-Nazi Party members, they are all Germans now, just as determined as the British and French to fight to the end.

Hitler's successive victories, although achieved by recklessly invading one small and weak nation after another, have not weakened his power. Although the undercurrents of opposition within Germany cannot be concealed by superficial unity, this counter-current rarely involves moral indignation.

The Nazi Party's past mistreatment of Jews aroused a sense of shame and disgust among the German intelligentsia, but there was no public outrage. Since then, the German people have gradually become accustomed to cruelty; they were even unmoved by the tragic fate of the Polish people. Although anti-Nazi factions have condemned this aggression, their motive is not for the trampling of neighboring peoples, but because Hitler miscalculated and dragged them into the vortex of war.

Britain no longer expects internal changes in Germany. But thinking long-term, expecting Germany to collapse not in economic or military terms, but in moral terms, may not be an illusion after all.

This conflict can be said to be a combination of many wars in one. By observing from different angles and from the standpoint of more than a dozen countries, it is not difficult to grasp the meaning of this decisive war. This decisive war can be said to be a major turning point in human history. Caught in the great waves of Europe, one can feel that this war is only one aspect of a major upheaval. After the outcome is decided, how arduous it will be for the victorious countries to rebuild Europe.

So, where does the decisive force lie? It lies in public morale and its ability to endure. After observing the rear of both belligerent countries, the author deeply believes that the key to victory or defeat in this decisive war lies in moral strength.

The last European war was only a transitional war. Although the weapons used were new, its thinking was still based on the old tune of previous wars. This decisive war can be said to be the first truly modern war, in which not only the army but the entire nation is fighting. The people in the rear are not only mobilized, their food is restricted more severely than that of the soldiers, their daily working hours are longer, and the dangers are greater. Therefore, public morale is naturally more important to the victory or defeat of modern warfare than military morale.

This kind of tempering of public morale is in full swing. Before the start of the major battle on the Western Front, Germany's fighting spirit was about the same as that of England and France. It was neither enthusiastic nor did it have any flaws. The patriotism shown in previous wartime was the most indifferent in this decisive war. When the army set off, there was no cheering or military music, which in turn proves the solemnity of this war.

At the start of the war, the Germans were even more tired than their enemies, as if they had lost their elasticity. They are stronger than others at enduring hardships. They have a genius for creating something out of nothing. It would be wrong to think that they would not fight to the end. Nazism has distorted their minds and strained their nerves, but Germany is still a force to be reckoned with, capable of fighting at all costs. But its fighting power is indeed limited, and this limitation lies not only in material resources but also in reserve forces. France is fighting this decisive war out of necessity. "We've had enough," "We must end it," is France's only war slogan.

The British, however, have the most morale. This may be because the British rear has not yet felt the suffering of the Germans, or because their daily life is not as chaotic as that of French metropolitan areas and small towns. But the British are more down-to-earth. Every Englishman knows what war is in his heart, and believes in how devastating war will be. They are prepared to be bombed, prepared to be exhausted after years of war, and in the end, they will sacrifice everything. But their souls cannot be lost.

Young French soldiers know that they are fighting for Christian civilization. The number of priests and pastors accompanying the French army has increased significantly. The British, young and old, believe that this decisive event is a battle between good and evil, with clear banners and no room for compromise. From Lord Halifax to the chauffeur, they all speak eloquently that this decisive event is a battle between the spirit of mankind and the forces of matter, and there is no reason to give up halfway.

The English and French have different psychologies, but their will to fight is the same. They are not only fighting to maintain their power and territory, but also to maintain the spiritual heritage, that is, for their souls.

The German mobilization was initiated by Hitler's will. He is indeed sufficient to represent the will of the nation to a certain extent, but to a certain extent, the German people have no right to choose. They are fighting for aggression, not for conservation. Aggression inevitably sacrifices others, and their position becomes that of the unjust who receive little help. Nazi Germany has absolutely no spiritual strength. This iron in the soul may become a fatal blow.

### The Significance of the Battle of Narvik

—伯明

The Norwegian coastline is 1,600 miles long, which is neither easy to protect nor easy to block. The port of Narvik in northern Norway is the only good port in Northern Europe that does not freeze all year round. Most of Sweden's iron sand is exported from this port. Since Germany lost its iron production supply from the Lorraine region of France, it naturally has to rely entirely on Sweden. Germany buys a total of 10 million tons of iron sand from Sweden every year. In the first six months since the start of the war, Germany obtained a total of 640,000 tons of iron sand from the port of Narvik, accounting for a quarter of the same period last year. In addition to Narvik, iron sand can of course also be obtained from ports in the Baltic Sea, but the Baltic ports are only open for seven months each year. Germany can obtain about 8 million tons of iron sand from these ports.

However, the iron content of each ton of iron sand is different. The iron sand exported from the port of Narvik is all Kiruna sand from northern Sweden, with an iron content of 60 to 65 percent. The iron content of iron sand from the Gällivare area and central and southern Sweden averages no more than 40 percent. Therefore, Germany needs to import 1,500 tons of iron sand from Gällivare and other places to equal 1,000 tons of Kiruna sand. Moreover, many German steel mills can only use Kiruna high-grade iron sand. The Swedish government holds half of the shares of the Kiruna mine and restricts the mine's annual output to 8 million tons. The iron sand shipped from the port of Luleå in the Baltic Sea is mostly produced in the Malmberget area near Gällivare. The problem that Germany needs to solve is whether the Kiruna sand can be transported to Luleå in the southeast instead of to Narvik in the northwest. But there are many obstacles. First, the distance from Kiruna to Luleå is twice as long as the distance from Kiruna to Narvik. If the original amount of sand is to be maintained, more railway cars must be added. The Swedish government is adding coal cars, which are expected to be delivered by the end of this year. Second, the Kiruna sand is transported down the mountain to Narvik. It can be crushed and mixed at the foot of the mountain and then poured into the ship. If it is transported to Luleå, most of the journey can also be transported down the mountain, but it must be taken out and loaded onto the ship. Third, the sand transported from Gällivare to Luleå is rolled and inspected in Gällivare, and Luleå does not have a sand rolling machine. According to Germany's plan, Luleå must install this expensive hard steel sand rolling machine, otherwise Germany can only transport the raw iron sand back to Germany from Luleå for crushing, but the amount of raw iron sand decreases after it is crushed.

Therefore, Germany attaches great importance to the issue of transporting sand from the port of Narvik. If German ships cannot reach Narvik, Germany will not be in a desperate situation, but it will definitely be in a more unfavorable position.

### Comparison of British and German Air Forces

— 霖

The German High Command summed up the first phase of the war on the Western Front by saying that the success of the German army on the Western Front was due to the superiority of the German Air Force. The German authorities obtained all information about the enemy's activities from it, and destroyed the enemy's navy and hit the enemy's morale. The greatness of its victory can be seen from the enemy's losses.

British Prime Minister Churchill reported to Parliament that the Battle of Dunkirk was a great test of the strength of the air forces of Britain and Germany. At that time, there were thousands of ships along the coast, and more than 300,000 troops were evacuated from the beaches. Could there be a greater target for the German Air Force than this? Could there be greater military importance than this? The German aircraft repeatedly attacked, but were repelled. Our army completed the evacuation, and the enemy suffered four times as many losses as we did. The German large aircraft squadrons launched a decisive attack on our aircraft squadrons, which were only a quarter of their size, but our aircraft almost repelled them. The power of our country's various types of aircraft and pilots is far greater than that of the enemy.

American Army Major Seversky also published an article in the New York Times, saying that the success of the British evacuation of Dunkirk was due to its fighter planes. From the perspective of those with aviation experience, it is indeed credible. Because British aircraft such as "Spitfire", "Hurricane", and "Defiant" are all the best of the fighter planes. They can be said to be invincible in the skies above the English Channel. If the British Air Force did not have this kind of superior strength, then this evacuation would have inevitably suffered great losses. The long duration of the battle between the British and German air forces, and the fact that it was a matter of life and death, actually started with this. Due to the cover of the fighter planes, it was very difficult for the enemy to bomb Dunkirk, and the evacuation of the British troops was a great success.

The words of the British and German authorities and neutral observers are like this. Now, I will translate and record the comparison made by the Manchester Guardian as follows:

The aviation squadron in the German army is different from the British Air Force, which is an independent army. Its development, like bamboo shoots after rain, only began in 1932, when Hitler appointed Goering as Minister of Aviation. For this reason, there is often a shortage of experienced staff officers and various instructors. However, for eight years, working hard, the German Air Force has become a strong force that cannot be taken lightly. The entire industry is mobilized to serve the Air Force. Aircraft manufacturing plants are concentrated in the eastern part of the country, so that they can be far away from air raids from the French side. All factory designs aim at rapid production, concealment, and comfortable employees. No matter how much money is spent, it is not spared. Initially, this work was carried out secretly, and by September 1935, the results were great, and the 24 squadrons of the Air Force had begun to show their prowess. Junkers and Heinkel 111 bombers also appeared at the same time. By 1937, Heinkel and Messerschmitt 109 fighters appeared in large numbers.

When Goering was planning, there were dozens of problems that needed to be solved urgently. What he longed for was mass production, so he had to first decide what kind of tasks the German Air Force would undertake in combat. The decision was to select several types of aircraft as the standards for specialized manufacturing in the future. Because any type of aircraft, once selected as a standard for mass manufacturing in various factories, is not easy to stop manufacturing and replace with other types. What Goering decided seems to be to let the Air Force assist the Army in combat, rather than letting it stand alone.

The German Air Force and land mechanized units complemented each other in the invasion of Poland. This was the way of combat that Goering idealizes. In terms of its training methods and standard styles, the German side had no idea of ​​starting a war with Britain at the time. Because this training method and the type of aircraft it selected do not allow for crossing the North Sea or large-scale air raids. The standard aircraft selected by Germany for mass manufacturing are the Heinkel 111 bomber and the Messerschmitt 109 fighter. The latter began mass manufacturing in 1935. At that time, this type of aircraft was actually the leader among fighter planes in the world. The only thing missing was a reliable 1,000-horsepower engine. After several improvements, it gradually expanded its motor power. However, due to the expansion of the engine, it seemed to lack agility in operation. The weapons installed are either four machine guns or two cannons. State cannot install both on one aircraft at the same time. It seems that the decision on which weapons to install will be made by the Air Force commander. The German theory seems to be that the only task of fighter planes is to destroy bombers, and as for engaging enemy fighter planes, it is still a minor matter.

The Heinkel 111 bomber was also a good choice when it began mass manufacturing. Its design was ahead of the British Blenheim aircraft, and its speed was also greater than that of the British elite Fury aircraft. Before the Spanish Civil War, the German side had an erroneous theory about the design of bombers, believing that bombers must have a large loading capacity (a large number of bombs or a large amount of gasoline, depending on the situation) and speed. Heavy weapons are regarded as not essential, because bombers can always escape when encountering enemy fighter planes. Therefore, the Heinkel aircraft only has one machine gun in the front and two in the back, each installed under the fuel tank. In order to increase the speed, it is impossible to install a turret on the long and narrow fuel tank. This is the advantage of British aircraft, which cannot be imitated by the German side for a while.

British Hurricane and Spitfire aircraft have extremely high speeds and are equipped with eight machine guns. Since their appearance, they have overturned the calculations on which the Messerschmitt 109 and Heinkel 21 aircraft were designed. The turrets installed on British heavy bombers make it even more difficult for German Air Force personnel to deal with.

Goering also considered the replenishment of new aircraft. The new fighter Messerschmitt 110 and the new bomber Junkers 88 have recently emerged. The Messerschmitt 110 is a twin-engine, two-seater aircraft equipped with two machine guns and two cannons in the front and two machine guns in the rear. The maximum speed is 350 miles per hour, which can still cover the bombers to fly to the British coast. But if you have to turn on the throttle to fight back, then its fuel will easily run out, and flying back is difficult. The Messerschmitt 110 aircraft is also unable to bomb bomber groups. Because the combat power of the turrets on British aircraft is not easy to deal with.

The new bomber Junkers 88 was produced in 1938. Similar to the earliest Junkers aircraft, it also focuses on speed and loading capacity, while firepower is secondary. It has one machine gun in the front and two in the back, and no steel armor equipment. The weight of this protective steel plate has been taken up by the bomb loading capacity. Its maximum speed is 300 miles per hour, which is conducive to diving and throwing bombs. But if it encounters British fighter planes, it is as easy to destroy as the Heinkel 111 aircraft. If six Junkers 88 aircraft encounter a Sunderland flying boat, they will be unable to deal with it.

In addition, Germany also has the Dornier 17 aircraft. This aircraft should be called a reconnaissance aircraft rather than a bomber. The Dornier factory is now working hard to manufacture the Dornier 18 flying boat. This type of flying boat has been willing to install magnetic mines. The Heinkel 115 seaplane has also been used for this purpose.

The German flying squadron has great mobility. There are no less than 500 airfields in the country, so bomber squadrons of various colors can fly from one place to another at any time. This is its only advantage.

### A Study of the Origins of the Gurkha's Annexation

Gurkha, also written as Kurka, was originally called Nepal, also called Nipal, also called Nibola, also called Palerbu, also called Barbu, or simply called Bu. The various names are due to repeated translations and errors, which is not surprising. Gurkha is the name of its separate city, located on a thoroughfare, and the most prosperous in trade. It is famous for this, just like the Western Regions' Kokand is known as Andijan. The Tibetan Zhi states that it is ten days' journey from the Sel area of ​​Rear Tibet, and it belongs to the border of Bai Mu Rong. Its land is called Little Western Heaven, connected to Zhuba in the east, to the Great Western Heaven Wupenzi in the south, to Baibu in the west, and to Rear Tibet in the north. It also says: From Mu Rong to the west for ten days, it meets the border of the Great Western Heaven, and after another ten days, it reaches the place of Prince Bu'er Ya of Little Western Heaven. According to the Western Guoyu Tu, Bai Mu Rong is Bai Bu, which is Gurkha. What it calls Pen Wuzi is the Wuxiekuai of Gurkha's South Guo. What it calls Bu'er Ya is Bengal in India. Tibet and India are bounded by snow mountains. The northern border of Gurkha is close to the snow mountains. The valleys are winding and deep, and the peaks and ridges are steep, reaching the sky, with snow all year round. Now, going west from Sichuan and Yunnan to Wusi Zang, going through all the Tibetan territory, crossing the iron chain bridge of Jilong, and then going west is Gurkha. The terrain is narrow and long, thousands of miles east-west, and more than a thousand miles north-south. Its capital is called Yangbu, also called Kathmandu, also written as Kapman. The land is fertile, producing wheat, millet, beans, soybeans, sugarcane, cotton, Dan Shen, nutmeg, etc.

### Optimistic Victory (2)

The gods have no plans for the improvement of mankind. People who believe in cults would never think that human life can be made happier and more resilient. Their golden age has passed, their great achievements have been completed, and their best hope is to imitate the past. The teachings of cults say that human life is empty, human nature cannot be changed, and the world is cold and loveless. In a society that believes in cults, there is no ideal of progress, and its philosophy is pessimistic. Pessimistic news is still very common today. Although there has been great progress in improving life, in discovery, invention, and scientific acquisition, all parties still hold a dim view of the future of culture. I think the biggest reason is because of this thing, that is, in the past twenty-five years, many of our great hopes have failed. The previous World War shook the basic structure of world life and proved to be a great disaster in human history. After the war, there were international efforts to seek peace. At this time, there were many dangers, such as many dangerous areas, excessive taxes, heavy international debts, and countless people who became crippled due to the war, all of whom needed care and treatment. In addition, people also began to discover the corruption of their governments and the practice of taking from one place to make up for another. They lost confidence in this weak international peace organization, and they suffered from an unprecedented economic depression in history. Due to unemployment, no income, and crime, the prevalence increased. The worst thing is that the Christian Church has become a kind of disappointment to many people. The church is divided into many factions, and it has no unified appeal on any issue in the world. Many sects are busy with the struggle between the new and the old, while civilians are begging for work opportunities in groups on the streets, but they ignore them. Because of all these situations, a natural pessimism has been produced, and today, no matter where you go, you can see evidence of this pessimism.

### Guidance for School Advancement

— Zhong Yi

Little friends, time flies quickly, and in a blink of an eye, summer vacation is approaching again. Perhaps you are a sixth-grade student, and in that case, you must be worried about the issue of advancing to the next school level. Little friends! If you want to advance to the next school level, you should prepare early. First, ask your teachers to hold mock advancement exams as much as possible, with all procedures following the real advancement exams. This is because it can give you experience and prevent stage fright. Second, do more composition exercises for advancement exams, such as "My Alma Mater," "My Educational Experience," "Motivation for Applying to This School," etc., as these are common test questions in general schools. Third, practice arithmetic operations, fractions, and percentage application problems extensively, so that you can apply them freely. Fourth, choose and purchase reference books for reviewing general knowledge, and read the important parts several times. If you can prepare in this way, then you will be largely confident in the three subjects of composition, arithmetic, and general knowledge. Your preparation for advancement can be considered complete. This only addresses the issue of preparation. Shanghai has a multitude of schools, and it is impossible to know their quality from the outside. Deciding where to go requires some consideration. Therefore, it is crucial to study the methods of choosing a school. In summary, there are generally these points: the school should have a long history, a good campus, rigorous coursework, excellent teachers, and the principal must be an education expert. Only those that meet the above conditions are good schools and worthy of your application. Of course, you yourself may not know which middle school is qualified. In that case, you can consult your teachers, your parents, your relatives, and your graduating classmates. Don't make a decision casually, or be tempted by easy admission without considering it carefully, and rashly apply. As a result, the school may not be good, leading to withdrawal halfway through, which not only harms your studies but is also very uneconomical in terms of time.

Finally, I want to talk about the points to pay attention to during the exam. First, be calm and unhurried, so as not to discount the arithmetic formulas and general knowledge you have memorized due to panic. Second, write neatly and avoid arbitrary revisions, so as not to fill the paper with scribbles, giving the graders a bad impression. Third, if you encounter a problem that you cannot solve immediately, put it aside temporarily and do the ones you can do first, and then think about the unsolvable problems last. The worst thing is to stop and try desperately to think about a difficult problem, but time passes quickly and does not allow you to hesitate. Fourth, don't rush to hand in the paper. Know that being the first to hand in the paper is not a great honor. Rushing to hand in the paper inevitably leads to carelessness and mistakes, fulfilling the saying, "Haste makes waste." Fifth, after finishing the test paper, don't hand it in immediately. You should carefully read it from beginning to end again, correct all the errors, and hand it in only after you are confident that there are no mistakes. Although the above points are all clichés, perhaps some children are tired of hearing them, but I believe that not many can do it! , If you can follow my words, then you will definitely not fail. Victory belongs to you!

Time passes so quickly, and tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival again. In the past, people in society were very interested in the Dragon Boat Festival, and there were many allusions that could be talked about. Little brothers and sisters, on this auspicious day, there is eating and playing, and they are happy! But now it is not a time of peace. We should not just seek pleasure. In this country where the disaster is deep, our little brothers and sisters also bear a part of the responsibility. Our country needs to win , although it depends on the loyal and brave soldiers on the front line, but we in the rear must be firm and serious, or help to do relief work, etc., to fulfill our duties to the country. On this festival, I remember the loyal and patriotic sage Qu Daifu (Yuan), who died for his country on this auspicious day! Let me write his deeds and tell our children.

According to the Ci Yuan: (Qu Yuan, a Chu person during the Warring States period, named Ping, alias Ling Jun, served as the Sanlü Daifu in Chu. King Huai valued his talent, but Jin Shang and others slandered and alienated him, so he wrote Lisao in the hope that the king would realize. During the reign of King Xiang, he was reused and demoted to Jiangnan. He wrote Yu Fu and other articles to express his ambition, and died by throwing himself into the Miluo River on May 5th. From this, we can see that Qu Daifu was not only a great writer, but also a minister loyal to his country. It is a pity that the foolish king at that time used slander and did not value him. He was demoted to Jiangnan, so he died in the river with his ambition, accompanied by the river gods. How can we not feel sorry for him! Therefore, later generations throw zongzi into the river on this day to worship him, to express their remembrance.

As for his throwing himself into the river out of righteous indignation, it seems to be a passive act in today's view, but at that time, the foolish king was unreasonable. There was no other way but to jump into the river and die to admonish him. However, his loyalty to the country is obvious and worthy of respect! Little brothers and sisters, in this time of national crisis, we should stand up quickly, unite sincerely, and serve the country in the possible range.

### Talking About Bathing

— Zhang Zhusun

The sun has softened the asphalt on the road, and pedestrians are constantly wiping the sweat from their foreheads with towels. The weather is really hot!

When children think of summer, they think of bathing. Children! Do you know the benefits of bathing? I will write a few benefits below. After you read them, think about whether they are correct or not?

(1) Cleanses the skin Every day, our bodies excrete sweat and other liquids from the sweat pores, as well as waste products after metabolism. Over time, these dirt emits an unpleasant odor, making others want to stay away from you. Not only that, these dirt can stop the breathing function of the pores, making people feel stuffy. The best way to remove these dirt is to bathe every day.

(2) Stimulates the skin The inner layer of human skin has many muscles, and these muscles contain many blood vessels of various sizes. These many muscles and blood vessels should be given the opportunity to contact and exercise with the outside world. Summer is of course not to be discussed, but in winter, except for the hands and face, there are few opportunities to contact the outside world. If we can bathe often, it is equivalent to giving the skin a chance to exercise often.

(3) Avoids colds Bathing every day (preferably with cold water) can make us less prone to colds. Because bathing can train the skin to adapt to sudden changes in the environment. People who do not bathe are easily invaded by bacteria when they encounter uneven hot and cold environments, which can cause colds.

(4) Bathing can cultivate the virtue of diligence People who bathe often must be diligent and energetic people. Observe Westerners. They love cleanliness and bathe every day regardless of the heat or cold. Therefore, they are very energetic in everything they do and are very diligent.

Children all know the benefits of bathing. But what should children who do not have sufficient financial resources to have bathing facilities do? I hope that they will at least wipe their bodies with cold water towels vigorously once or twice a day. This also has some of the effects of bathing.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (6)

— Min

I can't remember the various things in the dance school before. I entered the school in 1932, which can be said to be a very, very long time ago. Everything I have experienced since then is really too much. Whether it is my mother, father, two brothers, or the teachers in the dance school, they all feel it is beyond their expectations. Even I myself feel it is very fun and unbelievable. Sometimes I always secretly think, this is probably not Shirley Temple herself, but another little girl.

But there was a date that I remember very clearly. This is the most important date in my life. Everyone who knows me is saying that if it weren't for that day, there wouldn't be this day today. I would never work in such a large film company, I would never occupy a flat house alone on the set, I would never meet so many movie stars, and I would never receive letters and gifts from men, women, and children all over the world. Maybe I am just an ordinary little girl preparing to go to school to study.

That was in the early summer season. My third birthday was on April 23, 1932, and the banquet had already passed. On this day, my mother and I were about to walk out of the dance school when we saw a large hall, where many mothers were waiting with their daughters. When we looked at it, we knew that something unusual must have happened, because the children were all wearing the most beautiful clothes, and even their mothers were dressed neatly. My mother stepped forward and asked a lady what was going on. When the lady saw my mother, she seemed very surprised that she didn't know about it. Then she said, "Oh, don't you know? The Educational Film Company has sent a director here to select twenty-five children, because they want to make some short films about children. The children's ages are stipulated between two and four years old, and their height cannot exceed thirty-six inches, with one yard being the maximum. Isn't Shirley's age and height just right for these conditions? Why don't you let her stay here to see if she has a chance to be selected?"

My mother did not hesitate to say "no", and did not want me to stay here. She said that because I did not change into better clothes, how could I meet the director? It turned out that I was still wearing that simple and old dance dress.

The lady hurriedly said, "This is a pity. You should know that this is a good opportunity to step into the set. If you want to find such an opportunity again, you may have to wait a long, long time." My mother ignored her and walked away with me. I knew that she was hesitating in her heart, whether to go back or stay? So she took a few steps and stopped again, and then took a few steps forward. I knew that although my father did not approve of me entering the film industry, my mother was very interested in it. Finally, she stopped again and said to me, "Never mind, you stay and let them see you, it doesn't matter even if you are wearing old clothes." So my mother returned to the place where everyone was gathered. I remember a lady said to my mother, "Mrs. Temple, do you know that this film company has posted advertisements in the newspapers to recruit children to act? It is said that they have already auditioned five children." My mother hurriedly said, "I think they are going to select children who have experience on the screen. As for my Shirley, you know that she can't act. Even dancing is still in the early stages."

Entertainment World

### Traces of Entertainment

— Xiao Tian

Since the Yi Feng Troupe performed Dong Xiaowan, the Zhonglü Theater Troupe performed Ge Nenniang, and Xin Yanqiu performed Yujing Daoren, the talented people and courtesans of the late Ming Dynasty seem to have attracted people's attention again. I unintentionally flipped through a copy of Banqiao Zaji. The shallow me initially thought it was the work of Mr. Zheng Banqiao, but after fully opening the content and checking it, I realized that the so-called Banqiao was where the smoke and powder of Yuling gathered. The author was Yudanxin from Sanshan, who was also a talented person in the late Ming Dynasty. In the Ge Nenniang play, he and Li Shiniang both occupy important supporting roles. He seems to have special feelings for Li Shiniang. He has such a record in the biography of Li Shiniang:

"Then the rebel army crossed the river to the north, and many famous people crossed the river to Qiaojinling. Everyone envied Li Shiniang. Shiniang became more and more secretive, claiming to be sick, not dressing up, and thanking guests. Her mother loved and cherished her, followed her wishes, and politely declined to communicate with them, except for two or three confidants, who were happy to receive her and forget their tiredness. Later, she changed her name to Zhenmei and engraved a seal saying, 'The seal of Li Shizhenmei.' I teased her and said, 'Beauty is there, but chastity is not.' Shiniang wept and said, 'You know me, why do you say this! Although I am a humble dust, I am not a lustful and licentious person, like the woman of Jihejian. If I like someone in my heart, even if I treat each other with respect, my feelings will be harmonious. If I don't like someone in my heart, even if I force myself to sleep with them, I will not be compatible. My lack of chastity is my fate, what can I do?' After saying this, she wept and her clothes were stained with tears."

He said that Ge Nenniang was unparalleled in talent and art. Dong Xiaowan was a needle god and song saint, and was proficient in food recipes and tea scriptures. Bian Yujing was even more remarkable. She was knowledgeable, proficient in small regular script, good at playing the qin, and also good at painting orchids, making wind branches and graceful, and drawing more than ten pieces with one stroke. However, after reading his record of Li Shiniang, it adds a layer of image to people. It is a pity that these many beautiful women, no matter how talented and artistic they are, as for the preservation of chastity, they can only end up with the result of fate. I couldn't help but think of the general female artists of modern times, and shed some sad tears that are the same in ancient and modern times for them.

### Talking about Palace Costume Plays

— Xisen

Last Sunday, the Carlton Theater staged Wang Yuying and Wang Huichan double-acting The Drunken Concubine. After Mei Wan Hua retired to Hong Kong, no matter the first- or second-rate Dan actors dared to do it easily, because the palace costume play is a gorgeous and rich drama. The appearance and demeanor, that is, the makeup and costumes, are all based on the principles of magnificence and elegance, and there is no room for any reluctance. Wan Hua's dignified and beautiful appearance and graceful demeanor are enough to exhaust the beauty of the palace costume play. It is appropriate for the remaining sons to hold back and dare not try it lightly in the palace costume play.

Many of the Peking opera plays that were born out of Qinqiang are vulgar and uncultured, while those that were born out of Kunqu Opera are elegant and tasteful. The palace costume play has evolved from Kunqu Opera, so the words are elegant, which is beyond the reach of other Peking opera plays. The Drunken Concubine was created by the actor Wu Hongxi from Eling. Hongxi's stage name was Yueyuehong. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, he took his skills to Beijing and belonged to the Jiaoxi Troupe. At that time, the stage scenery was not valued by people. Wu Ling performed this, and first replaced the stage curtain with a new decoration. Then came the clear songs and wonderful dances, and the audience's minds were all happy and leisurely, and they almost thought they were in the palace. For a time, the people of the capital praised each other, and Wu's name became famous. Wu's nature was very stubborn, and he repeatedly violated the rules of the Pear Garden. On one occasion, during the performance, he even took away his headdress on the spot and quarreled with the public, so he was expelled and no longer performed in Beijing.

After Wu, those who were famous for palace costume plays at the time included Guo Jixiang, Yu Yuqin, and Lu Yushan. Then the palace costume play began to prevail. Wan Hua's skills were obtained from Yu Shan, but after repeated reforms, there were many original ideas, and it was getting farther and farther away from the old school. Today's performers of palace costume plays almost all flaunt the Mei school.

Palace costume plays are suitable for late at night and not for daytime, because the advantages of palace costume plays are entirely based on singing and dancing. Singing and dancing are not easy to gather the audience's spirit. In the late at night, it can make the audience concentrate and appreciate it to their heart's content, listening intently. As for the daytime, the audience's mind is scattered, making the performer even more unskilled, and there is no one who is not drowsy.

Hawthorne's Case

### The Dancer's Ending

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 1 "A very pretty lady!"

"Who reported the crime?"

"There is a Lu Jiansheng."

"Lu Jiansheng? ——Is that the manager of the Hua Da Bank?"

Hawthorne glanced at me while buttoning his navy blue serge casual clothes. "Do you know this person too? Ni Jinshou is a little anxious about this person. I didn't expect that the power of the bank's tomb would also affect you, a writer."

I was stunned. "How do you know?"

"Your tone and facial expressions both give me that impression."

"Alas, it's not because he is a banker. He does have a considerable status in society. He is the director of the Women and Children Relief Institute, the executive committee member of the Bank Association, and the founder of the Civilian Factory..."

Hawthorne suddenly waved his hand to stop me and said, "Okay, okay. You should stop blindly worshiping and take a closer look at him before you say anything. Don't you know that there are many people in society who wear the masks of 'celebrities' and 'well-known people', secretly doing things that are unscrupulous and shameless? ...Okay, stop talking nonsense. Ni Jinshou seems to be very anxious and is waiting for us anxiously. Let's go."

It was just 7:30 a.m. —— the morning of April 19, Monday. From Hawthorne's residence to Qingpu Road, the car journey was only seven minutes. When Hawthorne stopped the car in front of number 27, a police officer number 99 stationed at the door of the morgue hurried over to open the car door. He was familiar with Hawthorne.

He touched the brim of his hat and greeted, "Mr. Hawthorne, Inspector Ni has been waiting for a long time."

Hawthorne nodded and jumped out of the car. I also got out of the car and closed the car door.

The house number 27 where the case occurred is a semi-new small western-style house with a total of three floors. The outside is plastered with cement, and the windows are steel-framed glass windows, lined with light yellow curtains, and the appearance is very delicate. At this time, a corner of the building window was hit by the sun, shining brightly. This house is isolated, with the door facing Qingpu Road is facing south: the east side is adjacent to the corner of Datong Road; the west side is a small open space. ——(9)

### Tang Ruoying Accidentally on the Screen

Wu Bangfan, the owner of the Xuan Palace Theater, praised the beauty of Tang Huaiqiu's second daughter Ruoying's acting skills and strongly recommended her to the film industry. A certain company is also quite interested in recruiting her, but this matter may be difficult to achieve, because Ruoying likes to study and is not very interested in going on stage. She only makes occasional guest appearances in the Chinese troupe, and she is even less interested in going on the screen.

Brief News "Hollywood Movie News" will be published on the 14th, with both pictures and texts, and can be called the first-class American movie picture weekly. Novels and songs are all available, and honorary photos of American stars are given as gifts. It is published every Friday and sold at newsstands.

### Twenty Kinds of Storytelling Songs (10) Dream of the Red Chamber

— Frozen composition Xiu Yan drawing

Ancient and modern storytelling books are as vast as the sea; I think the most suitable for "filling into storytelling songs and broadcasting in Guanxian is none other than A Dream of Red Mansions".

The plot of A Dream of Red Mansions is very complicated, but the center of the description focuses on the love life of Bao and Dai.

There are very few people singing "Dream of the Red Chamber Storytelling Songs", and the script (the storytelling song artist Yang Binkui has it) does not know who wrote it. The reason why it cannot be welcomed should be attributed to the fact that the words in the script are not delicate and elegant enough, and the cutting skills are improper. The writer believes that if it can be compiled into storytelling songs based on Zhong Yun Jian's Dream of the Red Chamber Legend, the beauty of the harvest may be able to surpass "Pearl Tower" and "Tears and Smiles".
