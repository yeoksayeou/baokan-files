### Review of the Question of Italy's Entry into the War

Of all the various international problems, the question of Italy is one of the most difficult for observers to understand. The world is concerned, international researchers are exploring, and leaders of various countries are busy, especially about whether Italy will enter the war. However, if we look through the smoke, remove the branches, and examine the fundamental issues, then a very clear picture will immediately be presented to us.

First of all, we should point out that Italy's attitude since the declaration of war by Britain and France against Germany is, in legal terms, only a declaration of "temporary non-participation," rather than a declaration of "neutrality" in international law. In essence, its so-called "temporary non-participation" is actually a special way of participating in this unusual war. In other words, in this period from the start of the war to the present, it has used the weapon of "temporary non-participation" to participate in Germany's battle against Britain and France. How can we see this? Simply put: (1) In terms of the source, the relationship between Germany and Italy is just like that between Britain and France, there is an alliance relationship, and Italy's adoption of a non-war attitude is due to Germany's instruction and its own consent. In other words, in a whole set of double act, Germany plays the role of "war" in this period; while Italy is "non-war". (2) In terms of function, it can be divided into two points; First, Italy's non-participation in the war means that Britain and France cannot blockade the Mediterranean; and since Italy is an ally of Germany, it does not constitute international legal "neutrality", so it has no obligation not to transport military supplies and raw materials to allied countries. Therefore, Italy can be regarded as having organized a huge maritime transport team for Germany, making the only means of blockade that Britain and France regard as fatal to Germany completely ineffective. Second, in the center, after France declared war on Germany, it had to use a huge military force to guard against Italy at the same time; As the war evolves, the "participation or non-participation in the war" of Italy can be used in many places, and the power added to international politics is also extremely great. In this back and forth, is it more beneficial to Germany for Italy to participate in actual combat, or is it more beneficial to maintain the so-called "temporary non-participation"? This question involves various aspects such as military affairs and cannot be simply explained; however, according to the common conclusion of general researchers, most believe that non-participation in the war is more beneficial to Germany, especially more than participation in the war.

Therefore, to put it thoroughly, the question of whether Italy will participate in the war does not arise at present. The core of the current problem is only whether Italy has changed from a special form of participation in the war to an ordinary form of participation in the war; that is, whether the so-called "temporary non-participation" strategy will evolve into armed conflict?

If Italy's current tense appearance is only a political act, only to promote the so-called "peace offensive" that Germany is about to launch, then it will not participate in actual combat in the end. Otherwise, assuming that its demonstrated attitude does have its actual content, then the key to determining whether it will participate in actual combat lies in the attitude of Britain and France towards the Mediterranean blockade.

In the current situation where the war is expanding, in order to win the war against Germany, Britain and France will certainly not be able to sit idly by the phenomenon that Italy has been transporting military supplies, raw materials and other goods to Germany in the Mediterranean for the past few months. The purpose of Britain and France blocking Germany's path to the North Sea in the Norwegian war has been fully achieved. Currently, Germany has two paths, one is the Soviet Union on the mainland, and the other is the Mediterranean. Regarding blocking land routes, Britain and France have no possibility of using force, nor is it necessary. It can probably be solved through diplomatic means; as for the Bay of the Mediterranean, there are three paths that Britain and France can follow: First, regardless of Italy's reaction, forcibly blockade the Mediterranean; Second, force Italy to declare "neutrality" and then strictly implement maritime inspections: Third, force or induce Italy to provide guarantees not to supply Germany with military supplies, raw materials and other goods. None of these three are what Italy is willing to accept at present. Its only reply, according to its own claims, is to join the war; that is, it implies: since the role of "temporary non-participation" is lost, then there is no other way but to clearly remove the veil and participate in the war.

Therefore, if Britain and France allow the original state of the Mediterranean passage, they will not be able to carry out their strategy against Germany; if they block Germany's passage on the Mediterranean, it will prompt Italy to actually participate in the battle. These two methods are divergent paths for Britain and France to choose from. As for Italy, if it accepts the British and French methods under certain conditions when Britain and France take the second path, it is equivalent to canceling the German-Italian alliance; if it opposes the British and French methods and is loyal to the German-Italian alliance, it must go to war with Britain and France. These two methods are divergent paths for Italy to choose from. Naturally, when decision-makers make decisions, they have more or less constraints and still have some room for flexibility. However, when we comprehensively observe various factors and trends, the trend will eventually tend towards a break. The only thing in dispute is the time.

### Amidst the Tense Situation in Europe, Japan Harbors Ambitions towards the Dutch East Indies; Foreign Minister Arita's Blatant Expression Resembles the Self-Image of an East Asian Hegemon

Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita said in a speech to the Pacific Society last night that unless the powers allow Japan to fully participate in the economic development of the Dutch East Indies, conflicts between Japan and other powers in East Asia will be unavoidable. Japan "cannot be indifferent" to any developments that may change the situation in the Dutch East Indies. He said, "Our concern is not only limited to maintaining the political status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Due to the resources, trade potential, and industrial possibilities of the island, it is natural for Japan to seriously care about the economic status of the East Indies. The Dutch East Indies have relations with Europe through the Netherlands, but the East Indies are located in East Asia and are surrounded by the destiny of all East Asia. No one can bear to look at the East Asian nature of the islands." Arita compared Japan's concern for the Dutch East Indies with Britain's concern for Poland and Norway and the United States' concern for the Western Hemisphere. He said that Japan cannot be indifferent to the situation in China, so we are also concerned about "the evolution of the territory south of our country." Arita did not clearly explain the southern land and criticized immigration and business restrictions, so it seemed to warn that the Philippines may have conflicts with Japan in the future. Arita claimed that Japan's foreign policy is roughly to build a new East Asian order on a stable foundation. He said, "Japan should be a stabilizing force in East Asia and should enjoy special interests in mainland China and the territory south of our country." Arita said, "In its true sense, peace and stability depend on economic mutual benefit and mutual assistance. To give an example, there are now two countries, one with a small area and no rich resources, but a very large population, and the other with a large area and rich resources, but a very small population. Imagine that these two countries have no normal trade relations and allow each other to circulate goods. In this situation, how can we hope to maintain peace and stability in this region? In addition, assuming that the flow of goods between these two countries is restricted by tariff barriers and restrictions on immigration, then conflicts between these countries will be inevitable." Although Arita did not specify what these "countries" are, listeners all believe that he is referring to the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies. Arita continued, "This principle is suitable for any situation. I believe that the crux of the Pacific disputes is indeed due to this conflict and inequality. After this war, a new world order will be established, and this new order must be based on the solution of this problem." (4th Taiwan Public Power dispatch)

### German Troops Claim to Have Captured Louis Port, Street Fighting Occurring in Dunkirk, German Main Force Undergoing Large-Scale Transfer, Appears Poised to Launch New Offensive Within Days

Berlin, German High Command communiqué states: The battle of Dunkirk is nearing its end. Despite fierce resistance, German troops have entered the city and occupied Louis Port. Street fighting is currently underway. (Reuters, 4th)

London: Troops continuing to evacuate from Dunkirk arrived in Britain this morning. Several ships carried French officers and soldiers who had been fighting day and night without rest for the past few days. They still carried full military gear. Although the soldiers were exhausted, their morale was high, and they all expressed their willingness to return to France as soon as possible to fight the enemy again. It is reported that the German troops are fighting on the outskirts of Dunkirk, which has been heavily bombarded by the Allied forces, resulting in heavy losses. Many parts of the city are currently on fire, and the situation is extremely tragic. (Reuters, 4th)

Paris: The Allied forces in the north are continuing to engage in fierce battles near the port of Dunkirk. Despite the enemy's continuous bombing with aircraft and artillery along the coast, the Allied forces are still able to conduct an orderly retreat. At present, the enemy is also attacking the French defense line on the Dixmude and Yser River front. Our army and navy are not only defending the flooded areas, but also repelling the enemy in the dry areas. Enemy aircraft attempted to bomb Allied transport ships, and their submarines are also actively engaged. Fortunately, the British and French destroyer fleets are well-prepared and have shot down many enemy aircraft. The Allied forces are cooperating by sea and air to protect maritime transport effectively. In addition, front-line battles are intermittent, with only routine reconnaissance flights and very few attacks. On the Scher district front, enemy forces repeatedly attacked our outposts, but were repelled. In the Vas River area, our troops shelled enemy positions yesterday. (Havas, 4th)

Swiss Capital: The Tessino State Post Office newspaper recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that the German General Staff, in accordance with the principles of "blitzkrieg," has already drafted a new plan to launch a new offensive in the short term. The air force will be solely responsible for attacking Britain, and attempts will be made on the French front to break through the line built by General Weygand. (Havas, 4th)

Paris: French air force pilots who flew reconnaissance missions over the Western Front have returned. According to their reports today, the German forces are undergoing large-scale transfers, seemingly striving for a swift resolution. Their numbers are estimated to be between 500,000 and 600,000. According to reports, German tank forces, artillery units, and infantry are concentrating in large numbers, preparing to attack along the Vasne, Ena, Argan line, to stage the second act of the blitzkrieg. It is also reported that "French planes have bombed various roads and German troop concentrations, attempting to disrupt the German convergence. Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand stated that the German forces will launch an offensive in that area within the next 48 hours." (International News Agency, 4th)

Paris: The General Headquarters released a war bulletin this morning stating, "Enemy forces have launched fierce attacks on our positions near Dunkirk. Our troops are bravely resisting and constantly counterattacking. Our fleet, amidst enemy fire, is cooperating with the British Navy to defend the port of Dunkirk and cover the troops boarding ships from the port, with considerable success. Their brave fighting spirit is exemplary. In the Saint-Avold area, enemy forces have repeatedly attacked our outposts, but have not succeeded. They are only reinforcing their strength on the right bank of the Ena River and intensifying their attacks on our positions on the west bank of the Sa'ar River. In addition, our bomber squadrons attacked enemy positions and bombed their communication lines yesterday and today. Enemy bomber groups, escorted by many fighter planes, flew over the suburbs of Paris for the first time this afternoon, dropping bombs. They were immediately met with resistance from our fighter planes and anti-aircraft artillery, and suffered heavy damage. Most of our fighter planes are the latest models. According to initial reports, we shot down a total of seventeen enemy aircraft." (Havas, 3rd)

Paris: Military figures here recently stated that the battle in the Dunkirk area has been extremely fierce in the past two days. After more than twenty days of hard fighting, the Allied forces have been constantly bombed by German aircraft. With their backs to the sea, they can obtain sufficient supplies from the sea, but they have not received any reinforcements. On the German side, the number of personnel is far greater, and fresh troops are constantly being added. The differences in work and rest and the disparity in numbers are significant. However, the Allied forces have not only resisted bravely, repeatedly repelling the German forces, but also counterattacked repeatedly, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Yesterday, the German forces besieged the Allied positions all day, but were repelled. On one occasion, they penetrated the French army

### Circumstances of the Fall of Lille

Berlin: According to German war correspondent Xu Mi, on May 27th and 28th, German troops attacked the Darati defense line east of Lille, advancing towards Lille in three routes. The French army resisted stubbornly, leading to fierce street fighting. Finally, the French army surrendered, and German troops occupied Lille. (Haitong, 4th)

Berlin: A special correspondent from the German war zone broadcasted today about the chivalrous behavior of the German troops after occupying Lille. It is claimed that when the German commander occupied Lille, he issued an order allowing the French soldiers defending the city to retreat with their entire force without harm. There were three teams of French soldiers defending the city, fully armed, parading through the most prosperous area of the city, led by four French generals. Although the French soldiers had been trapped for many days and without food for several days, they still maintained the spirit of soldiers, commanding respect. Four German generals stood watching, and when the French soldiers passed in front of them, they also saluted. The German army deeply valued the French soldiers who had fought hard to defend the city. It is said that heroes cherish heroes. After the French army withdrew, a large group of prisoners followed. It is reported that these prisoners were soldiers who had fought hard near Lille for four days and surrendered after exhausting their strength. (Haitong, 4th)

position in one location. By dusk, the French army launched a major attack and finally repelled the German troops. By this morning, the German troops had begun to attack again. Detailed information is still unknown, but in general, the German troops have a local advantage, but the price is extremely high. The battle is fierce and unprecedented. As for other places, they are relatively calm. (Havas, 3rd)

Paris: The French General Headquarters released a war bulletin stating, "On the Dunkirk front, our troops are resisting with all their might, despite the enemy's significant pressure, preventing the enemy from advancing. Allied troops were therefore able to retreat gradually from the port last night. As for other fronts, there is nothing major to report." (Havas, 4th)

London: A Reuters military correspondent learned that a large number of French troops are still fighting hard in the Dunkirk area and continuing to prepare for local counterattacks. As Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand is deploying a major offensive, he is preventing at least fifteen German divisions in the Dunkirk area from being transferred to other operations. The French defense line extends from the coast to the Maginot Line. Between them, apart from a few places, there are strong natural obstacles such as rivers. There is currently a 12-mile gap between the Somme and Vas Rivers, and an 18-mile gap between the Aisne and Moselle Rivers. The possibility of the German army attacking between Abbeville and Amiens must also have been taken into account, but General Weygand may not be waiting for the German attack. (Reuters, 4th)

### British Admiralty Announces, Three More Destroyers Sunk, Twenty-Four Small Warships Lost

London: The Admiralty announced that the battles of the past week can be described as one of the most difficult battles in naval history. The number of British, French, and Belgian troops safely transported back to Britain from Belgium and northern France will shock the world when detailed figures can be released. The retreat of these troops was carried out under intense and continuous air raids and artillery and machine-gun fire. Its success depended on the close cooperation of the Allied naval, land, and air forces, and the firm determination and courage of all parties involved. The British Navy participated in this military operation with several destroyer squadrons and a large number of various types of small ships. The number quickly increased to 222 British warships and 665 other British ships. The above figures do not include the French warships and merchant ships that participated. The rapid gathering of more than 600 various types of small ships was due to the voluntary participation of volunteers. They have shown great and tireless spirit. "As soon as the order to collect various types of small ships was issued, respondents from all parties came one after another, and voluntarily sent personnel to drive the ships to the gathering point. At that time, they did not know what these ships would be used for. These volunteers worked hard day and night under the most difficult conditions, and made a great contribution to the success of this military operation and the rescue of hundreds of thousands of lives. The troop withdrawal took place on the beaches in and around Dunkirk. Enemy forces constantly disrupted the process with air raids and artillery fire. The British Navy opened fire to destroy enemy artillery positions and protect the flanks of the retreating troops. Enemy submarines and high-speed motorboats were also quite active, but were all heavily damaged by the British Navy. The water there is very shallow, the strait is quite narrow, and the tide is extremely strong, making it extremely difficult for any warship to maneuver. If any ship is driven carelessly, there is a risk of blocking important straits and usable parts of the port of Dunkirk. In addition, the weather was not entirely conducive to military operations. A northwest wind blew for two days, causing many waves on the beach, slowing down work on the beach and making it more difficult. Only on one afternoon was there a dense fog, greatly reducing enemy air force activity. It is not difficult to imagine the degree of danger involved in carrying out this large-scale retreat under intense and continuous air raids. The success of the retreat was a victory for the Allied naval and air forces, preventing the enemy's most powerful air force, which took off from nearby, from doing any harm. The port of Zeebrugge has been sealed off with ships filled with cement, and the gates to the sea entrance of the canal and the hydraulic machinery have been destroyed, and the gates have also been closed. In fact, the remaining ports that have fallen into enemy hands have become useless. All the remaining fuel has been destroyed. The losses of the British Navy are relatively minor. The sinking of the destroyers Grafton, Grenade, and Wakeful Three was announced on May 30th. The destroyers Basilisk, Keith, and Havant Three have also been sunk due to enemy action. Among the other 170 small warships participating in the battle, a total of twenty-four were lost, including one naval aviation supply ship, one minesweeper, and one gunboat, five small minesweepers, eight fishing boats, and eight various types of small warships.

Swedish Capital: London announced yesterday that the British ship "Yongjia" had sunk. The ship displaced 1,478 tons and had a crew of twenty-two sailors, fourteen of whom are missing. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### Allied Forces in Northern Norway Surround German Troops

Paris: The Norwegian Embassy here issued a communiqué stating that the Norwegian Telegraph Agency's correspondent in Narvik reported that the Norwegian, French, and Polish troops in Narvik are continuing to advance to surround the German troops. The cleanup operation in the area is currently underway. (Reuters, 4th)

London: The Norwegian Telegraph Agency reported that most of Narvik has become a rubble field after seventeen German aircraft bombed it fiercely on Saturday afternoon. As a result of the high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs that were dropped, the residential area was severely damaged, and the commercial area was almost completely destroyed. The German aircraft were eventually chased away by fighter planes, and many of the migrating aircraft were shot down. (Reuters, 4th)

### During the Major Air Raid on Paris This Time, German Air Force Dropped Over a Thousand Bombs, Seventy-Six Fires Broke Out in the Suburbs After the Bombing, French Communiqué Claims Seventeen Enemy Aircraft Shot Down, Britain and France Will Take Retaliatory Action

Paris: The Prime Minister's Office issued a communiqué stating that enemy aircraft flew over the suburbs of Paris for the first time this afternoon, dropping bombs, mostly attempting to bomb military targets, dropping over a thousand large and small bombs, killing and injuring over two hundred civilians, including forty-five deaths. (Havas, 3rd)

Paris: When the alarm was sounded at 1:15 yesterday afternoon, the citizens of Paris were having lunch. After hearing the alarm, they quickly took cover. Within a very short time, there was no one on the streets. Anti-aircraft guns suddenly fired, and the sky was filled with white smoke. The air was shaken by the sound of anti-aircraft shells exploding and the sound of airplanes rattling. This was followed by the heavy explosion of a German plane crashing to the ground. The anti-aircraft fire continued for twenty minutes before stopping. Soon after, the sound of French fighter planes intercepting enemy planes was heard. A wisp of black smoke in the air indicated that one enemy plane had been hit and crashed. The alarm was lifted at two o'clock. Several buildings in the city caught fire after being hit by bombs, and firefighters quickly arrived at the scene to put out the fires. (Reuters, 4th)

Paris: Yesterday's first group air raid on Paris by German aircraft is expected to be the prelude to a large-scale attack on this French capital. There were six large squadrons of German aircraft flying over Paris, at an altitude of about 8,000 meters. The bombing lasted from 1:15 p.m. to 2:50 p.m., dropping 10,680 bombs, 83 of which fell within the city and 977 of which fell outside the city. A total of 45 French people were killed, including 8 in the city, and a total of 149 were injured, including 54 in the city. Most of the bombs dropped were incendiary bombs, so 70 holes caught fire, 14 in the city. Eight schools were hit, one of which was hit by 15 bombs, killing 10 students and injuring 18. A temporary hospital was also hit, killing two male nurses and injuring an unknown number of people. When the alarm first sounded, thousands of employees from various offices who had just finished lunch were returning to their offices. As soon as they heard the alarm, they hurriedly left their offices to take cover. However, within three minutes, the streets were empty. As soon as the German aircraft entered the city's airspace, large squadrons of French fighter planes were waiting in formation, and the two sides fought fiercely. The citizens of Paris were deeply stimulated. According to official announcements, 17 German aircraft were shot down. (International News Agency, 4th)

Paris: Yesterday, a German radio station predicted that the Allied forces would take retaliatory action for yesterday's German air raid on Paris. According to a radio reporter, Germany's actions will likely be answered, and German cities and towns will have to endure the consequences of this bombing. (Reuters, 4th)

German Supreme Headquarters: This afternoon's German war report stated that German fighter planes attacked French air force bases near Paris, breaking through the French air defenses, attacking French airfields and air force bases, causing fires in many places and explosions. 79 French aircraft were shot down, and no less than 300 to 400 aircraft parked on the ground were destroyed by bombs. Yesterday, German anti-aircraft guns shot down 21 enemy aircraft, and nine German aircraft were missing. Last night, enemy aircraft dropped bombs in the Netherlands and western and southern Germany, but with little effect. Near Rotterdam and in western Germany, one enemy aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and two more were shot down by German fighter planes. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Paris: Regarding the air raid on the Paris metropolitan area, according to initial reports, the German side dispatched large bombers, capable of carrying several tons of bombs, divided into multiple batches, attacking in turns. One batch had as many as eighteen aircraft. The number of incendiary bombs and ordinary explosive bombs dropped was no less than a thousand. The scale was unprecedented. This air raid had two purposes: to destroy various military targets and to cause panic among the residents. At the time, some enemy aircraft deliberately used large bombs to bomb railway stations and airfields, while other enemy aircraft selected an area and scattered smaller bombs. Their power was not enough to destroy five- or six-story buildings. In addition, the enemy aircraft were flying at high altitude, about 7,000 to 8,000 meters above the ground. When dropping bombs, they did not fly down quickly, so few of them hit the target. Many bombs fell in the forests in the suburbs. Most of the fires that broke out in the city were quickly extinguished due to effective firefighting efforts. However, a large factory in the suburbs suffered more damage. Many of the factory's workers were killed or injured. The injured were immediately sent to nearby hospitals for treatment, while the other workers continued to work as usual. In addition, many civilian houses were hit. In the suburbs, an eight-story building had a bomb fall on the roof, going straight down to the second floor. Most of the houses in the residential areas of Paris had few intact windows. The farthest place that was bombed was about 60 kilometers from the city of Paris. Three fires broke out in the Paris metropolitan area and the southwest suburbs. Although they were quickly extinguished, the thick smoke did not dissipate and was still visible by evening. In addition, a military hospital in the suburbs was hit by 20 bombs. The main part of the hospital was destroyed, and two female nurses were killed and several others were injured. At that time, German aircraft also attacked nearby military targets. It is difficult to deny that the bombing of the hospital was intentional. A middle school in Paris was not hit and fortunately there were no deaths or injuries, only material losses. After the bombing ended, Paris returned to normal, and people from all walks of life continued to work as usual. (Havas, 3rd)

Paris Citizens Calm, Many Schools Destroyed

Paris: After Paris was bombed by German troops yesterday, the citizens remained calm as usual. The residents strictly maintained order during the bombing and did not panic at all. Most of the victims (about 200 dead and injured) were careless or too adventurous, so they did not take cover in time. The number of German aircraft participating in the bombing was about 240 to 300. No fewer than a thousand bombs were dropped on Nannai, including high-explosive and incendiary bombs. As far as is currently known, at least 45 people, including one American expatriate, have now died. After the bombing, all the bombed streets were cordoned off with ropes to prevent curious citizens from gathering to view the bomb craters and collapsed houses. The streets on both sides of the Seine River were filled with rubble and shattered glass. There are countless bomb craters throughout the city, several of which are very deep, causing gas, electricity, and water pipes to be cut off. Among the bombed houses, there was one boys' middle school, one girls' middle school, two primary schools, and four rural schools. One of the schools had been converted into a hospital and was hit by 15 bombs. Two hospital staff died. (Reuters, 4th)

### British and French Air Forces Bomb German Airfields and Attack German Supply Columns

Paris: The Ministry of Aviation issued a communiqué stating, "A squadron of our heavy bombers flew to Germany last night and bombed various airfields, dropping no less than 30 tons of bombs. Our aircraft squadrons also flew repeatedly to the north of our country to attack German supply columns, inflicting heavy damage on them. In addition, our reconnaissance aircraft took photos on the front line and safely returned to their bases after completing their missions. As for the large German bomber squadrons, they were also active in our country this afternoon. Our fighter planes immediately took off to meet them, and anti-aircraft artillery also opened fire, resulting in the shooting down of several enemy aircraft, with as many as 17 planes in the Paris metropolitan area alone." (Havas, 3rd)

London: The Ministry of Aviation issued a communiqué last night stating that during a large-scale attack on northwestern Germany last night, bombers bombed troop assembly areas and set fuel tankers on fire. They also flew low to strafe transport columns with machine guns. When the aircraft bombed the important railway junction of Sost east of Dortmond, a row of high-explosive bombs landed in the center of the crowded train station. Trains in operation were hit and stopped, and freight cars loaded with goods were directly hit. Shortly after midnight, an attack on a troop assembly area was also quite successful, first destroying several fuel tankers, then setting them on fire with incendiary bombs. The road and rail junction at Osnabrück was attacked for the second night, and it was reported that one end of a canal bridge had been destroyed and the nearby railway tracks had been bombed. The enemy air force bases at Rotterdam, Deventer, and Wesel were all attacked at night. Several buildings on the Rotterdam airfield were hit by large quantities of large bombs. A large hangar at the Wesel airfield, which is currently used by German bomber squadrons, was seen with bombs landing on it and exploding. (Reuters, 4th)

### The Italian War Participation Issue: An Arrow Nocked and Ready to Be Released. The Cabinet Approved Four Important Administrative Matters. Rome is Filled with a Wartime Atmosphere. Wartime National Organization Law Applies to Philippine Territories

Rome: The Cabinet held a State Council meeting today, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini, which lasted for one and a half hours. Afterwards, a public statement was issued stating that the State Council had passed various measures, especially those concerning administrative issues. According to well-informed sources, the most important of these measures are: (1) Male civil servants in various civil administration agencies who have been drafted into the military will be replaced by women or elderly retired personnel; (2) Additional funds will be allocated to the Navy to build warships, the number of which has not been disclosed; (3) Increase the number of naval academy admissions; (4) The wartime national organization law will be extended to all African territories. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)

Rome: Today's meeting of the Italian Cabinet in Rome is seen by many as perhaps the most important meeting in history. However, the atmosphere in Rome today, at least on the surface, is very calm. There seemed to be extraordinary activity in the sky in the early morning, and the sound of artillery could be heard from afar. This is probably to make people aware of the scenes that may occur this week. The current hesitation will end sometime between Friday and next Tuesday. This is the unanimous opinion of the people, but there is no real basis for it. Rumor has it that the Fascist Grand Council has scheduled a meeting for tonight, and it is expected that the Supreme National Defense Committee will also hold a meeting. News from Paris claims that the next action of the Italian government will be to put forward a recent proposal to convene an international conference. Few believe this. The authorities allowed the newspapers in Rome to reprint this news, with the addition of a lukewarm response from London and Paris. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

Paris: After the Italian Cabinet held a meeting today, a public statement was issued stating that the measures passed were all administrative matters. Political figures here were not surprised to hear this, nor did they think that the Italian authorities were still hesitant. It is likely that Italy wants to delay for a few more days before taking final action. If Italy does make a final decision in the future, it will not be able to use the provocative attitude of France as an excuse. Since the outbreak of the current European war, all French newspapers have been cautious, and the French people and Italian expatriates in France have been able to live in peace. Even the French and Italian troops in the Alps have been able to show camaraderie. As for the economic demands made by Italy, France is also willing to negotiate with Italy. Although these negotiations have broken down, the blame should be borne by Italy. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)

New York: Columbia Broadcasting Company has just announced that it has received a broadcast message from Germany stating that Italian Crown Prince Umberto has left Rome and is heading to the headquarters of the army group. (Note: The Italian army is divided into two army groups, commanded by Crown Prince Umberto and Chief of General Staff General Graziani, respectively.) (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)

Rome: Regarding the issue of Italy's participation in the war, political figures here generally believe that the country will inevitably participate in the war by the 8th of this month at the latest. Although all parties have tried their best to dissuade Italy from pulling back from the brink, it seems that Prime Minister Mussolini has decided to resort to war, with the attitude of letting the cannons speak. Even the Vatican has tried to maintain peace, but the Italian government has not yet responded to the most recent mediation. Generally, Italy firmly believes that although France's military strength is extremely strong, it will be difficult to resist the joint offensive of the German and Italian armies for a long time. It is expected that the war will be over before Britain continues to send expeditionary forces to France and the United States provides substantial assistance to Britain and France. In short, after the Italian Cabinet holds a cabinet meeting tomorrow morning, everything will be clear. (United Havas dispatch on the 3rd)

Rumor Has It That German Troops Are Concentrating on the Austrian Border, Preparing to Help Italy Launch a Flanking Attack on France

New York: New York Special Report: A reporter in Belgrade reports that, according to unverified news, German troops are currently concentrated near Vienna. It is now believed that these troops are preparing to cross the Italian border to assist the Italian army in a flanking attack on France. It is also learned that German submarines piloted by Germans have now docked at the bases of the Dodecanese Islands, which shows that Italy apparently intends to accept German assistance. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

Rome: According to a report from the Rome correspondent of the Haitong News Agency, decisive events may occur this week. The reasons are as follows: (1) The news of the German army's continuous victories has left an extremely deep impression here; (2) Franco-Italian relations, according to news from Africa, have become increasingly tense, and Italians in Morocco and Algiers have been persecuted; (3) It is rumored in Tangier that Britain and France have plans to occupy the area; (4) Demonstrations demanding the return of Gibraltar have been held in Spain for days, showing the solidarity between Italy and Spain; (5) After German planes bombed Marseille yesterday, they flew south, making Italians feel that the war zone is getting closer and closer. Patriotic demonstrations have been held in Italy for days. 400,000 workers in Turin marched yesterday, showing their determination to obey the Duce's orders and decided to send a telegram to the Duce, which read: "Waiting for your command to advance and strive for victory." (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)

Rome: Italian figures are now increasingly convinced that Italy will soon participate in the war, and regard the postponement of the Rome World Exposition as another clear indication. Military doctors and veterinarians will be called up on Thursday. Italian newspapers are now filled with news against the Allied powers, such as a report from Italian East Africa stating that the Allied powers are planning to attack the area. Other news claims that Italian expatriates in French North Africa are being abused. Newspapers predict that the German army will use 8,000 aircraft to assist in a large-scale offensive along the French front lines of the Somme and Aisne rivers. "Il Popolo di Roma" stated, "Germany has divided the enemy forces and is now preparing to conquer them individually." (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

### Britain and France Are Fully Prepared to Deal with Contingencies

Italy's Request to Establish Bases in Spain Was Reportedly Rejected by Franco in Harsh Terms

Paris: According to the opinions of well-informed French figures, although the possibility of Italy joining the German side in the war cannot be ignored, it may not take decisive steps immediately. There are various reasons to believe that Germany intends to launch a new offensive against France. From the German point of view, it is naturally hoped that the majority of French manpower reserves can be contained in other areas. If Italy participates in the war, France will undoubtedly dispatch troops to the southeast. However, before sending troops, France must first determine whether Italy is one of us. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

Paris: Amid French preparations to deal with any emergency situation and any Italian attack, French political observers today stated that whether Italy immediately starts a war against the Allied powers or first launches a "peace offensive," the French see little difference. Observers also stated that Italy's open intervention is already generally expected. However, if the peace plan proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is based on territorial changes, as Germany has done, or is based on demands on the Mediterranean, then the Allied powers will only have a negative response to such a plan. France is fully prepared to deal with any Italian action, whether it is launched on the Alpine border, in Corsica, in Africa, or in Syria. Even if Italy has decided on its actions, the basis of cooperation between Germany and Italy remains unclear. Whether Italy's operations are independent or attached to Germany's coattails is a question that is worth discussing. French journalist Mr. Taybo said, "Important Nazi figures believe that if Mussolini participates in the war, he may not strictly follow Hitler's words. Mussolini may violate Hitler's wishes and hope to gain something in the Balkans, which will inevitably cause the consequences that Hitler fears." In addition, "Le Paris-Soir" believes that one of the purposes of the German planes bombing southeastern France is to create a Franco-Italian dispute and force Italy to take action. According to the newspaper, the German planes initially flew downstream along the Rhone River to the sea, and then turned north to make the French suspect that the planes came from the Mediterranean. The newspaper said, "If the German side wants to confuse right and wrong and create a Franco-Italian dispute in the two days before Mussolini's speech, is it not the case that the German planes did this? Italy's dangerous intervention is generally expected, because the situation in the Balkans has already become serious." (United Press dispatch on the 4th)

London: The Allied powers are now fully prepared for the possibility of Italy joining the war to help Germany. They will no longer make diplomatic efforts to ease Mussolini's decision. Political circles here mostly expect Italy to launch between June 5th and 10th. The Allied powers have completed their defenses on both the east and west sides of the Mediterranean and on land along the borders of Italy and Libya. Regarding Italy's position, two developments are enough to clarify it: first, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has notified the Allied powers of Italy's decision and said that our country is about to participate in the war; second, diplomats from neutral countries have received a report from Madrid stating that the Italian Prime Minister's request to use Spanish territory for Italian military operations has been rejected. According to this report, the Italian Duce began making this request to Franco three months ago. Recently, he made the request again, wanting to use Algeciras, the Balearic Islands, La Línea, and Spanish Morocco as operational bases. It is heard that Franco was still hesitant when the Italian Prime Minister made the first request, but the second time he simply rejected it. If Italy obtains La Línea and Algeciras as bases, it can use them to threaten Gibraltar. If Spanish Morocco is used by Italy for military purposes, it will be difficult for the Allied forces to prevent Italy from controlling the gateway to the western Mediterranean. If the Balearic Islands are occupied by Italy, the French army will not be able to transport its colonial troops to the European continent to fight. British newspapers reported that the Axis powers are pressuring General Franco, saying that if he does not cooperate with Germany and Italy, they will overthrow his regime with the Falange party. (United Press dispatch on the 4th)

### Nice Listed as a Territorial Claim

Rome: The "Nice and Savoy Action Committee" has recently been established here, with former diplomat Gonsaudin as chairman. According to the committee, Nice and Savoy were ceded to France when Italy was unified in 1860 and are part of Italy's territorial claims against France. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)

### World Expo Postponed

Rome: The Italian government's announcement of the postponement of its 1942 World Exposition was considered here yesterday to be the most serious indication that Italy will participate in the war in the past two weeks. Well-informed sources pointed out that Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly indicated that the preparations for the Expo are proof of Italy's intention for peace. Recently, most of the 53 members of the British Remote Prohibited Goods Control Committee stationed in Rome left here by train to France yesterday. It is heard that other members will leave the country on Tuesday. (United Press dispatch on the 4th)

### Italian Expatriates in the Egyptian Capital Are Withdrawing One After Another

Egyptian Capital: Due to the tense situation in the Mediterranean, the number of Italian expatriates returning to their country by taking domestic ships is increasing daily. Today, many Italian elementary school students boarded ships at Port Said to return to their country. Those residing in Egypt are extremely anxious about the news that Italy is about to participate in the war. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)

### Rumor Has It That Adriatic Sea Strengthens Its Power; German Consulate in Split, Yugoslavia, Expands

Paris: The German consulate in Split, Yugoslavia, has recently been expanded and handed over to the counselor of the German embassy in Belgrade for management, replacing the original administrator, a Yugoslavian. This move is clearly intended to strengthen Germany's power in the Adriatic Sea. According to reports, Split, also known as Spalato, is a seaport in Dalmatia, located on a peninsula extending into the Adriatic Sea. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

### Churchill Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons; The German Northern Route Is Coming Fiercely; The British and French Allied Forces Are Fighting Hard

London: Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons today about the progress of the war, saying that after the French defense line on the Sedan and Meuse rivers was breached in the second week of May, the British and French forces that had entered Belgium at the request of the King of Belgium could only retreat quickly to Amiens and the south to protect themselves. However, this fact was not realized. The French commander-in-chief initially thought that the French army was capable of making up for the gap, and the northern army was under his command, and that retreating at that time would cause more than twenty divisions of the Belgian army to be destroyed by the enemy and abandon the entire land of Belgium. This point could be predicted. Therefore, when the strength and scope of the German invasion were discovered, and when General Weygand replaced General Gamelin as the French commander-in-chief, the British and French forces in Belgium worked hard to defend the right side of the Belgian army and gave their own elite troops to the newly formed French army, which had to advance to the Somme River with strong strength and defend it. However, the German army soon poured into the right wing and rear of the northern army, using as many as eight or nine armored divisions, each division with about 400 armored vehicles of various types. The army cut off all communication between our army and the main French army, and thus our army's food and ammunition supply route was cut off, because all supplies had to pass through Amiens first, and then through Abbeville. The German army quickly reached the coastal cities of Boulogne and Calais, and almost reached Dunkirk. After the counterattack of these armored and mechanized troops, a large number of German divisions took trucks, and behind the trucks were the dense German regular army, advancing on foot, which was relatively slow. The German people have always been prepared to be led to trample on the lands of other countries. As for freedom and comfort, they have never experienced them.

The attack of this armored division almost reached Dunkirk. Although it was not certain, it was almost certain. Boulogne and Calais soon became places of fierce fighting. After a short period of resistance, the garrison in Boulogne retreated under the orders of the British government. A brigade of riflemen, the 60th Rifle Regiment, the Queen Victoria's Rifles, and a large British tank corps, along with thousands of French soldiers, totaling about 4,000, defended Calais to the end. (Applause) The German army demanded that the British brigadier surrender within an hour, but the officer refused. (Applause) After four days of fierce street fighting, Calais fell silent. This memorable defensive battle came to an end. The navy only rescued thirty survivors who were not injured, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. However, their sacrifice was not in vain. At least two armored divisions had been transferred to overcome them, otherwise the two divisions would have attacked the British Expeditionary Force. Their containment of the German army has added a glorious page to the history of light armored divisions. Because at this time, the waterway to Gravelines was still open and defended by the French army, which allowed the port of Dunkirk to remain passable. When the northern army realized that it could not reorganize its communication with the French army through Amiens, there was only one way to choose. At this time, it seemed to be in despair. The British, French, and Belgian forces were almost surrounded, and their only retreat route was to retreat to a port and the nearby beaches. They were then subjected to fierce attacks from all sides, and the enemy outnumbered them many times.

When I asked the House of Commons a week ago to set this afternoon to state the war situation, I was deeply afraid that it would be difficult to announce the greatest military catastrophe in our long history at that time. Several experts and I saw the same thing. At that time, I thought that only about twenty or thirty thousand people could get on board. The entire French First Army and the entire British Expeditionary Force stationed north of the gap between Amiens and Abbeville seemed destined to be defeated by the enemy in the plains, or to surrender due to lack of food and ammunition. This serious news is what I will ask the House of Commons and the nation to prepare to listen to. The British army, which is the root, core, and brain of the British army on which we have relied in the past and will rely on in the future to build a war army, seems to be completely annihilated on the battlefield, or will fall into humiliating or hungry surrender. This was the atmosphere a week ago. But another blow could prove to be fatal, and Father suddenly descended on us. The King of Belgium had previously called on us to provide assistance. If this monarch and his government had not broken off with the Allied powers that had saved Belgium from destruction in the last war, if they had intended to hide in deadly neutrality, then the French and British armies could not only save Belgium, but perhaps even save Poland.

### The Situation in the Mediterranean Is Becoming Tense; Egypt Is Intensifying Its Alert; Britain and France Have Strong Military Power in the Near East; If Italy Challenges, It Will Encounter Misfortune

Cairo: Although newspapers around the world believe that Italy will soon join the war, Egyptian figures do not think so. The creation of this psychology is largely due to the strong naval and land forces stationed by the Allied powers in the Near East. Many people believe that if Italy dares to challenge these well-equipped and strategically stationed troops, it will be tantamount to madness, because the initial action of the Allied troops will be to blockade the Suez Canal and cut off the connection between Abyssinia and Italy. However, the Egyptian government is now engaged in preparedness to defend the country. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

### In Accordance with the Treaty, Britain and Egypt Are Cooperating Closely

Cairo: Egyptian Prime Minister Maher declared last night after a full cabinet meeting that the cooperation between Egypt and Britain is now closer than ever. Egypt is determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with Britain in the spirit of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. After the cabinet meeting, British Ambassador Lampson visited Prime Minister Maher. The Prime Minister said that the government is determined to suppress rumors in Egypt, so it has promulgated a law to be implemented immediately. Anyone who makes "harmful to the country" remarks will be sentenced to imprisonment. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

Budapest: It is rumored that Hungary has begun a military cooperation with Germany and Italy, because large troops are being transferred from the southeast and west to the northeast. The Soviet troops in that area are concentrating along the Carpathian border. It is also heard that the movement of troops concentrated on the southern border of Germany is the prelude to the exercises scheduled for this week. About 250,000 soldiers are participating in the exercises. (International News Agency dispatch on the 4th)

### U.S. Senate Passes the Vinson Naval Bill, Stipulating $700 Million to Build New Ships; Naval Aircraft Increase to 4,500

Washington: The United States Senate passed the Vinson Naval Bill yesterday, increasing the strength of the United States Navy by 11%. The bill stipulates an expenditure of US$700,000,000. This is not the US$5,000,000,000 rearmament program proposed by President Roosevelt, but only the annual naval shipbuilding bill. The bill was referred to the House of Representatives yesterday for approval of the amendments made by the Senate. The Senate passed the bill yesterday without any debate and without using a recorded vote. The bill will add 167,000 tons of warships that are not overage, including 79,500 tons of aircraft carriers, 66,500 tons of cruisers, and 21,000 tons of submarines. The bill also stipulates that naval aircraft will be increased to more than 4,500 and 12 lighter-than-air aircraft will be built. The naval auxiliary team will increase by 75,000 tons. The bill also authorizes the Navy Department to increase the equipment of the Portsmouth, Philadelphia, and Norfolk shipyards to meet the needs of naval shipbuilding.

### The Mission of the Spanish Delegation Visiting Japan

### European War Background: Memoirs of Ambassador Henderson (Part 5) Translated by Section

At 1:30 PM on September 29, 1938, the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy convened at the Nazi Party's new building in Munich. Mussolini arrived by train from Rome, Daladier by plane from Paris, and Chamberlain followed closely behind. The German people cheered along the streets. The four leaders discussed for thirteen hours, concluding at 2:30 AM on Friday. All parties were able to calmly deliberate at length. With Mussolini present, Hitler was less inclined to lose his temper. Mussolini's mediation between the two sides made compromise easier. Ribbentrop's scheme failed. The meeting's delayed conclusion was largely due to the need to translate each person's speech into English, French, and German, and the difficulty in hastily drafting the agreement. Among the leaders, only Mussolini could speak all three languages. Finally, after considering Hitler's memorandum presented at Godesberg and the successive amendments proposed by Britain and France, the final agreement was drafted, which is the world-renowned Munich Agreement.

The Munich Agreement deprived Hitler of three things he desired: giving the German army combat experience, personally becoming a hero conquering other countries, and venting his anger on Czech President Beneš and the Czech people. Chamberlain, by eliminating a world war opposed by the German military and civilians, might, in a sense, be something for which Hitler should be grateful. However, on the other hand, Hitler being forced to change his military plans meant that any sense of gratitude would be overwhelmed by his resentment. Furthermore, some of Hitler's subordinates constantly urged him to fight Britain while it was underprepared, but now he had accepted the Munich Agreement, missing a golden opportunity. Afterward, Hitler was deeply disturbed, fearing that these pro-war voices were correct, and he became increasingly irritable.

Even based on the Munich Conference experience, Hitler was negotiating with three individuals of equal status, none of whom were subservient. Having had this experience, Hitler thereafter disliked resolving issues through negotiation. Moreover, the widespread popularity of Mr. Chamberlain in Germany somewhat diminished Hitler's prestige, which displeased him.

Hitler was Austrian, possessing the opportunistic traits characteristic of Austrians. Complex schemes with uncertain outcomes were typical of him. Unfortunately, Hitler's opportune timing allowed him to become increasingly arrogant and domineering. His risky maneuvers involved his close associates preparing in secret, while Hitler himself waited for the other side to make a mistake, then seizing the opportunity. In March 1938, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg held a plebiscite, and in March of the following year, the Czech government rashly interfered in Slovakia. Hitler, without revealing his intentions, seized the opportunity to advance, all of which are examples of this. After the Munich Agreement was signed, Germany was truly at a crossroads between adventurous advancement and maintaining the status quo. Generally speaking, if Germany had followed the path of maintaining the status quo, the people would have lived in peace and prosperity, and Hitler himself, having achieved great accomplishments over the past six years, should have rested and proceeded with his plan to restore Germany. Hitler's so-called desire for long-term peace should have been sincere. When I returned to Berlin in mid-February 1939, Hitler, even if he hadn't considered the path of maintaining the status quo, had not yet decided when to take another risk. A few days later, when I met him, he seemed genuinely pleased to see me. Göring was about to leave for a vacation on the Italian coast. Ribbentrop assured me that my long absence from duty was due to illness and had nothing to do with the recall of the American ambassador in November after the mistreatment of Jews. His attitude towards me was also good. This impression led me to be optimistic, but I quickly realized my mistake.

On March 1, Hitler hosted the annual banquet for the diplomatic corps, and I first sensed that the overall situation was more ominous than promising. Typically, Hitler would stand in the reception room after the banquet and speak with the envoys of various countries for five to ten minutes each. The previous month, when I met him, he shook my hand three times and seemed quite friendly, but this time it was different. When speaking to me, his attitude was evasive, his eyes did not meet mine directly, and his words were mostly empty, strongly asserting that Britain should not obstruct Germany in Central Europe. I had heard this before, so there was nothing new or surprising, but his attitude gave me a sense of bewilderment and unease. Looking back, he must have weighed the pros and cons of using force against Czechoslovakia and decided to launch an attack on March 15. I remembered the situation when I met him on March 3 of the previous year. At that time, he was constantly thinking about Vienna, and the German army finally marched into Austria on March 11. That year, he decided to occupy Czechoslovakia on March 11. At that time, a large army was gathered in Vienna, waiting for Hitler to inspect them and celebrate the first anniversary of the annexation of Austria to Germany, and troops were also deployed in southern Germany to strengthen Italy's demands on France.

Once Hitler made a decision, he would ensure that it proceeded in a rational manner. On March 11, he summoned Slovak Catholic priest Jozef Tiso to Berlin, urging him to declare independence and assume the presidency, placing the small state of Slovakia under German protection. Czech President Hácha, hoping to spare his country from invasion and terror and at least obtain humane treatment, also followed Tiso and arrived in Berlin on March 14, entirely on his own initiative.

Little did he know that Hitler had no humanity to speak of. Hácha was old and frail, and his daughter accompanied him to take care of him. The Germans welcomed him with courtesy. Ribbentrop presented his daughter with a bouquet of flowers upon arrival at the station, and Hitler gave her a box of chocolates when they arrived at the hotel. This was what he called humanity. Czech Foreign Minister Chvalkovský accompanied the president. After Hácha and Ribbentrop exchanged greetings, Hitler received Hácha at the Chancellery at one o'clock in the morning. A German doctor was on standby at the Chancellery to treat Hácha if he became unwell during the talks. However, before Hácha arrived at the Chancellery, the German army had already entered Czechoslovakia.

Hitler and Hácha continued until four o'clock in the morning. Hácha told Hitler that he was deeply concerned that Czech troops would resist the invaders. Hitler immediately warned him that if that were the case, the German air force would immediately bomb Prague. Göring, who had returned, also said the same. After repeated struggles, Hácha personally called his cabinet members to convey this message. Besides that, Hácha could only sign the prepared treasonous treaty.

Hácha was old and frail, but I would have been able to maintain my dignity as head of state and refuse to sign. On the morning of March 15, Hitler arrived in Prague before Hácha and announced to the public that Bohemia and Moravia were now German protectorates.

The Polish question soon became tense, and I tried unsuccessfully to meet with Hitler on July 29. At that time, Hitler was inspecting the Siegfried Line with Ribbentrop, an ominous sign. Soon, the clouds of war thickened, the French army was mobilized, and the British navy was also taking swift action. This was intended to show Hitler that they were prepared to fight. But Ribbentrop remained calm, always believing that Britain would never fight.

Hitler was also self-aggrandizing at the time, actually considering Ribbentrop to be the second Bismarck. And Ribbentrop also considered himself such, advocating for war to prove his position. Bismarck would not hesitate to falsify the Ems Dispatch to provoke the Franco-Prussian War. Ribbentrop might as well imitate him, obscuring Britain's true intentions to achieve his ambitions. His refusal to give me the conditions for resolving the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues—wasn't that Bismarck's old trick? Göring once told me, "What you dislike about Ribbentrop is his obstinacy." I replied, "His obstinacy sometimes borders on idiocy."

When Hitler began negotiations with Stalin is a question mark. In Hitler's speech on April 28, the anti-Soviet rhetoric of the past was noticeably absent. On May 3, Maxim Litvinov, a supporter of the League of Nations, was also removed from his position as Foreign Minister. Several weeks later, the new Soviet ambassador to Germany was received by Hitler with great courtesy. All of these were clues. The Soviet Union's agreement with Germany was nothing more than a desire to see it and Britain and France destroy each other, so that it could profit from the chaos.

Until August, Hitler and his subordinates also criticized Britain and France's negotiations with the Soviet Union.

On August 23, I went to Berchtesgaden to meet with Hitler. At that time, Ribbentrop had arrived in Moscow to sign the German-Soviet Pact. Hitler was triumphant, not hesitating to talk about how valuable this pact was. I then questioned him about his past anti-Soviet stance. He was momentarily stunned and speechless, then said that Britain and France had driven him into the arms of the Soviet Union.

With the German-Soviet Pact completed, the situation in Poland became acute. On August 31, the Germans announced their final demands on Poland. The next morning, I learned the details from Göring's aides and immediately conveyed them to Polish Ambassador Lipski, reporting them to his government. This was the last time the Polish ambassador was able to speak to his authorities by phone. By the evening, he was banned from doing so. At noon that day, I informed the German Foreign Office that the Polish government had accepted the British government's advice and was instructing Ambassador Lipski to contact the German government to immediately implement a temporary solution to the Danzig issue. The Germans never responded. The Polish government then instructed Ambassador Lipski to meet with Ribbentrop. The situation was thus extended by twelve hours. But what Hitler wanted to know was whether Lipski was a plenipotentiary representative. Otherwise, the arrow was already on the string, and Poland would either have to submit or be severely beaten.

### Ministry of Education Directives to Universities: Graduation Exams Changed to Comprehensive System; Main Subjects from Previous Years Included Before Overall Change; Lingnan University Decided to Hold Exams in Mid-June

(Hong Kong Dispatch) In order to improve and assess the academic performance of universities and vocational schools, the Ministry of Education has formulated six measures, the most important of which is to stipulate that, starting this semester, graduation exams will be changed to a comprehensive system. In addition to testing subjects from the last semester, it will also test major specialized subjects from previous years. Those who fail will not be allowed to graduate. It is reported that Lingnan University, Guangzhou University, and National University in Hong Kong have all received this directive and have decided to implement the comprehensive system starting with this year's graduation exams, and have decided to hold the exams on June 14th and 15th. The Ministry of Education's Measures for Assessing Academic Performance and Comprehensive Examinations for Vocational Schools and Above are copied below:

It has been observed that the level of students in vocational schools and above has slightly improved compared to the past, but the qualitative development of vocational schools and above has not been able to fully match the quantitative development. In order to improve the level of students in vocational schools and above and seek to improve the quality of higher education, the key points of the Measures for Assessing the Academic Performance of Students in Vocational Schools and Above are hereby formulated as follows: (1) Periodic tests must be held at least once per semester. The test papers should be properly kept by the school, and the Ministry may order their review at any time during the year, or review them according to the curriculum when sending personnel to inspect. (2) Students' usual lecture notes, reading notes, as well as reading practice and experiment reports, should be combined and assessed separately from temporary experiments to form the usual grades. The method of review is the same as in the previous article. (3) Semester exams should be strictly implemented at the end of each semester and should not be held early. Semester exam grades should also be combined with usual grades to form semester grades. The semester exam grades mentioned above must be registered and submitted to the Ministry for review at the end of the semester in accordance with academic regulations. The Ministry may also randomly review test papers of certain subjects. (4) Students who fail a semester exam but score between 40 and 60 points may be given a make-up exam or required to repeat the course. If the number of failed credits exceeds one-third of the total number of credits taken in the semester, the student should be required to repeat the grade. If it exceeds one-half, the student should be required to withdraw from the school. (5) Graduation exams will be changed to a comprehensive system. In addition to testing at least four subjects in the final semester (at least five for vocational schools and specialized schools), at least two of which must be from the entire academic year (at least three for vocational schools and specialized schools), at least three major specialized subjects from previous years must also be tested. Those who fail will not be allowed to graduate. The graduation exam subjects mentioned above must be reported to the Ministry for approval when submitting the list of graduates. (6) The Graduation Examination Committee and students' graduation theses (graduation theses are required for vocational schools and specialized courses) must be strictly implemented in accordance with the university regulations and the revised regulations for vocational schools. Starting this semester, all schools should strictly implement the above-mentioned regulations. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued for compliance and reporting. [Signed] Minister Chen Lifu.

### Provincial and Municipal Training of National Education Teachers (1): Outline of Measures Promulgated by the Ministry

(Chongqing Airmail) Since the promulgation of the Outline of Organizations at All Levels of Counties, the implementation of national education throughout the country needs to be promoted urgently and without delay. It is learned that the Ministry of Education, in order to lay the foundation for the implementation of this education, has promulgated the Outline of Measures for Training National Education Teachers in Various Provinces and Municipalities in accordance with the provisions of the Outline for the Implementation of National Education, and ordered the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and municipalities to strictly comply. The main points are disclosed below:

(1) Principals and teachers of central schools and principals of national schools should, in principle, be trained by normal schools and special normal courses. Teachers of national schools should, in principle, be trained by simplified normal schools and simplified normal courses.

(2) When provinces and cities begin to prepare for the establishment of central schools and national schools, they should open training classes for principals of central schools and national schools, gather personnel preparing to serve as principals of central schools and national schools, and provide them with one to three months of training. The training subjects will be determined separately. The above-mentioned training may be jointly held by the provincial and municipal educational administrative organs and the local administrative cadre training committees.

(3) Provinces and cities should conduct a general registration and assessment of primary school teachers in accordance with the ministry's regulations for provinces and cities. For teachers who fail the assessment but whose academic ability is still competent, national education teacher refresher courses may be organized and given three to six months of training to serve as substitute teachers. The subjects will be determined separately.

(4) If there is a special shortage of national education teachers in a province or city, a short-term national education teacher training class may be organized with the approval of the Ministry of Education to train substitute teachers for national schools.

(5) In order to meet the needs of the number of teachers, normal schools and simplified normal schools may adopt a "training-internship period system." The methods are as follows:

1. Normal school: Two years of training at school - two or one years of internship - one year of training back at school. 2. Simplified normal school: Three years of training at school - two or one years of internship - one year of training back at school.

(6) Schools implementing the "training-internship period system" must continue to provide students with regular correspondence guidance during the internship period, and must set up traveling internship instructors. The curriculum distribution for the "training-internship period system" will be determined separately.

(7) If there is an extraordinary shortage of national education teachers in each county within the normal school district, and there is no formal teacher training institution in the area to train teachers, the provincial educational administrative organ may temporarily designate a public junior high school or the county government may submit a request for approval to add teacher training subjects to the third grade of the county junior high school in accordance with the Ministry's Measures for Adding Teacher Training Subjects to the Third Grade of Junior High Schools to train substitute teachers for national schools.

(8) In order to train a large number of national education teachers in provinces and cities, during the first phase of national education implementation, special normal courses and simplified normal courses attached to normal schools and secondary schools may be utilized as much as possible, and refresher courses and short-term training classes may be organized to train substitute teachers. However, at the beginning of the second phase, the number of classes in various types of normal schools should be gradually increased, and the number of various short-term training classes should be reduced.

(9) In order to facilitate the advanced studies of in-service teachers or volunteer teachers, provinces and cities should organize correspondence schools or summer seminars to assist their advanced studies and examine their performance.

(10) Provinces and cities should set up traveling instructors for correspondence schools for primary school teachers to hold short-term seminars for correspondence school students in different subjects and regions.

(11) Provincial and municipal educational administrative organs should formulate measures to guide graduates of central schools (or senior primary schools) to enter simplified normal schools, and to guide graduates of junior high schools to enter normal schools, and supervise and order schools to earnestly implement them, in order to guide students to the rational aspirations of entering normal schools.

(12) Provincial and municipal educational administrative organs should formulate guidance measures for the admission of new students to normal schools, and supervise and order all types of normal schools (departments) to earnestly implement them, in order to establish the understanding and aspirations of normal school students to engage in education and grassroots political work.

(13) Provinces and cities should designate appropriate villages (towns, pao) as the sites for students of all types of normal schools (departments) to intern in village (town) and pao administration.

(14) When provinces and cities implement the newly promulgated teaching subject and hour tables for various types of normal schools (departments), training classes, and refresher courses, before the curriculum standards are revised and promulgated by the Ministry of Education, they should report the implementation situation and the content of the textbooks they have revised, supplemented, or compiled to the Ministry for filing at any time.

(15) Substitute teachers and teachers who have completed refresher courses in provinces and cities should be examined annually in accordance with the regulations for the examination of primary school teachers, so as to obtain qualifications in accordance with the examination.

(16) Provincial and municipal educational administrative organs should formulate a four-year plan for training national education teachers in accordance with the various existing provisions of this outline of measures, referring to the normal education facility plans and the national education implementation plans of the respective provinces and cities, and the number of teachers needed annually, and submit it to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation.

(17) When provinces and cities plan to train teachers needed for popularizing national education, they should still set up normal schools in each district according to the original normal education implementation plan of each province and city. If each district cannot set up a separate women's normal school, a women's normal department should be set up in the normal school.

### Chinese-Western Team Track and Field Meet: Chinese Hurdle Preliminaries Held Today; Competition at American School Starts at 5 PM; Sun Hupei and Guan Youwen Expected to Qualify

The 1940 Chinese-Western Team Track and Field Meet, sponsored by the International Track and Field Association, opened last Saturday. The meet was originally scheduled to be held over two days, with competition continuing this Saturday.

Only eight people are participating in this event, with six scheduled to qualify, so only two will be eliminated.

Looking at the situation, Sun Hupei of the Chinese team has the strength to finish within one minute, and not only is there strong hope for him, but he should also have a good result. Guan Youwen should also be able to get a place. On the Western side, MacLaine, Jacobs, and Lumbo have strong momentum. H. Turner of the School League and Talbolin of the Western Youth also have hope of qualifying in the preliminaries. According to the record for the event, the highest record is held by Finke at exactly 59 seconds. In international track and field, which is measured in meters, Tao Yingjie holds the record at exactly 60 seconds. The national record, also measured in meters, is Jin Guan's 58.3 seconds, which is the best result.

Special Treatment for Students: Tickets for this meet were originally priced at one yuan and one jiao in national currency. Now, in order to give students a discount for attending, student discount tickets will be sold for only five jiao in national currency for the exciting final events on Saturday. Anyone wearing a formal school badge and having sufficient proof of being a student will be able to enjoy this discount.

Athlete Numbers: 19 Talbolin (Western Youth), 147 Peden (Western Force), 68 H. Turner (School League), 51 Zhang Shaoda (School League), 143 Jacobs (MacLaine), 135 Lumbo (MacLaine), 82 Guan Youwen (Chinese League), 87 Sun Hupei (Chinese League).

### Grass-Roots Group B Tournament Opens

Unfortunately, No Chinese Participate: The 1940 Shanghai tennis season has unfolded with the rising heat. The most important events to punctuate this season are the Group A and B leagues.

Exchange rates for Hong Kong, Japan, etc., also uniformly decreased. The unofficial British and US exchange markets initially experienced extreme tightness, then suddenly rebounded slightly. The spot market continued to tighten sharply. According to a source in the exchange market, the New York market recently saw a sharp decline in US stocks and commodities. Chinese speculators in this city suffered significant losses, estimated at around US$5 million. Most had to cover their positions in the black market, resulting in a severe shortage of funds. Hong Kong speculators have also been telegraphing in repeatedly recently. Therefore, during the buying frenzy yesterday, the spot pound initially rose sharply to 3 pence and 625 cents, and the US dollar fell to its lowest point at $4.90625. Fortunately, HSBC, American Bank, and the British firm Sassoon sold, and Hong Kong funds and local Chinese firms re-entered the market.

### Profit-Taking Not Uncommon, Gold Market's Rise Hindered

Yesterday's spot gold market fluctuated around 6,400 yuan. Although the foreign exchange market was tightening and buying interest was strong, the rise was hindered by retail investors holding onto profits and selling at high prices. The morning opening was at 6,480 yuan, a sharp increase of 150 yuan compared to the previous day, reportedly due to eager buying by a certain gold firm. Subsequently, continuous selling by retail investors and money changers, as well as a rebound in the foreign exchange market, caused the price to gradually decrease to 6,320 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market remained tight, securities firms and gold firms bought in, and the afternoon closing was at 6,400 yuan. Initially, the afternoon situation was still heated. Securities firms and gold firms bought again, driving the price from 6,420 yuan to as high as 450 yuan. Before closing, retail investors, money changers, and banks uniformly sold aggressively, resulting in a closing price of 6,370 yuan, a further increase of 40 yuan compared to the previous day. The market momentum weakened after closing. The final price was 6,340 yuan, with no buyers. The total trading volume for the day was approximately several thousand taels. Sales of gold jewelry in silver shops were flat. Customs gold, etc., remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Still Up 40 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially reported tightening foreign exchange rates, strengthening confidence. A certain gold firm first absorbed 20 taels from a securities firm at 6,480 yuan, up 150 yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, retail investors were willing to sell, frequently selling off. At that time, silver shops and money changers were also selling off. Soon, the foreign exchange market suddenly rebounded, and the appetite of the banks weakened, and the price soon fell by 130 yuan. A silver shop sold 10 taels to a money changer for 6,350 yuan. As sellers gradually decreased, banks and securities firms bought in, and the price rose again, exceeding the 6,400 yuan mark. A money changer bought 20 taels from a bank for 6,420 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Sees a Boost in Confidence

Foreign Stocks Are Extremely Dull; China-Belgium-US Bonds Drawn

The securities market saw a general increase in prices yesterday. After Zao Yang was recaptured, confidence was boosted, and short sellers were somewhat panicked. Currently, both long and short positions are unable to take action due to their indecisiveness, so buying and selling are also flickering and uncertain. After a period of high prices, it is easy to suffer setbacks. It has not yet reached the stage of a true price increase. Trading was relatively active yesterday. Type A broke through 60 yuan, and Type E also broke through 50 yuan. Tong Ji, Lian Yi, and Yu Chang received more Type A and Type E. Hong Kang, Run Li, and Tong Kang saw selling. The noon closing price rose by 35 to 60 cents. The opening was particularly strong in the afternoon. Lian Yi, Sheng Da, Geng Xing, and Yi Chang all saw demand. However, sellers of Type E from No. 16 were scarce, and the market weakened. Run Li, Jiu Feng, and Hu He Ji saw selling. The market momentum suddenly weakened by 23 cents.

### Cotton Yarn: Yarn Firms Being Liquidated, Speculators Fearful, Market Trading Is No Longer the Same

The yarn market is calm, not escaping its state of stagnation. This is because raw materials are scarce and factory profits are thin. Furthermore, the general speculators' thoughts are not as strong as they used to be, so market transactions have decreased. In addition, the advertisements for the liquidation of yarn firms are numerous, so people are increasingly fearful. Although some are still buying and selling, most are aware of this situation, and many have let go and are watching, waiting for the opportunity to decide the outcome.

The current yarn market opened in the morning. 20-count Double Horse continued the heat from the afternoon of the previous day, rising to 1,400 yuan, then slightly falling to 1,385 yuan. Then, it was heard that the exchange rate was still decreasing, and the buying wind suddenly ignited, rising to 1,425 yuan. Unexpectedly, the high price caused profit-takers to emerge, the market loosened, and the market immediately fell to 1,360 yuan. The closing slightly improved. It was found that the transaction volume for half a day was 1,590 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 20 yuan. 650 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount of yarn bought by each group is listed separately below:

Hong Kong: 700, Counterparts: 890

Total: 1,590

### Factory Yarn Shipments More Difficult, Cotton Market Declining

The cotton market trading is exceptionally sluggish. Factories still have no demand. This is because the yarn sold at high prices by the factories has been affected by the market, and shipments are difficult. Therefore, the raw cotton business remains stagnant. The current cotton trading is listed below:

Kang Jiang Hua: 205.00, Counterparts bought 100 pieces
Omura: 204.00, Counterparts bought 100 pieces
Da Zhong Ji: 245.00, Counterparts bought 150 bales

In other news, the foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was quiet. Due to the lack of important buyers and spot merchants, overseas cotton merchants sold off in the market. As a result, the closing price fell by 5, 6, 8, and 9 pounds. The Indian cotton market: Yesterday, the forecast fell by 8 rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trading has been exceptionally quiet in recent days. Although the exchange rate has tightened, raw cotton trading has not been active. Only the thoughts of counterparts have become more firm. However, the selling price of foreign firms, according to the exchange rate settlement, their selling price is larger than that of ordinary counterparts. The yesterday's cotton market, converted to a futures price for delivery to the factory at a US exchange rate of $5.0625, is as follows:

20 count: US Metrin: 23.90, Lower Grade: 32.0
32 count: US Metrin: 344.10, Lower Grade: 323.20
42 count: US Metrin: 347.90, Lower Grade: 337.0

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Has a Solid Foundation

The cloth market initially rose and then fell back. The recent turnaround in cloth prices has led local customer groups to seize the opportunity, and the number of transactions has been quite considerable. However, the inventory in the market is particularly large, and there is still a surplus of supply over demand, so sellers are unable to raise prices. However, compared to the previous week, the market has tightened slightly. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill have increased by 10 to 25 cents. Colored cloth has increased by 25 to 50 cents. Summer light-colored goods have a short sales period, and sellers mostly offer lower prices. Local dye factories and wholesale houses have transacted 50,000 to 60,000 bolts of grey cloth, pongee, colored cloth, and bleached cloth, etc. The Zhejiang Road Wen and Yong groups have transacted more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth, etc. The North Road Yan and Jin groups have transacted nearly 100 pieces of blue cloth, bleached cloth, and serge, etc. The Guangdong and Yunnan groups have transacted 100 to 130 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, and printed cloth. On the 5th, 225 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 55 pieces were shipped to Singapore.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Rushes Up and Then Quickly Declines

The rice market was exceptionally turbulent yesterday morning, rising and falling twice, totaling two yuan. In the end, there was no glory or shame. At the morning opening, continuing the rising momentum of the previous afternoon, confidence was very firm. Inland Shao and Yong groups and rural customers immediately searched for it everywhere. The buying interest in foreign rice was strong, rising steadily. Later, the news that the gold price had risen to 6,600 yuan led to speculators fueling the fire, absorbing endlessly, and suddenly the entire market was in chaos. The situation became increasingly chaotic, and cries of prices soared. Number 1 Chen Saigon reached 57 yuan, Number 2 was 54.5 yuan, Huo Jiao was 55.5 yuan, Number 2 was 54 yuan, Xiao Jiao was 53.5 yuan, and Tokyo polished rice was 53 yuan. However, the chaos and noise meant that you could say anything, and the market had no standard. Such unrestricted price increases caused people to be wary. The previous prices were not realized, and sales were frustrated. People stood by and watched. Then the market changed, and the market quickly showed a soft trend again, with more sellers than buyers and abundant market goods. Furthermore, general customers and vendors, on the edge of the holiday, desperately needed funds and sold off one after another. In an instant, it suddenly fell by two yuan. By the noon market closing, the prices of all kinds of foreign rice were the same as the previous market. In the afternoon, the buying appetite from all parties was still weak, and the market continued to soften. Number 2 fell from 53.5 yuan to around 52 yuan, Xiao Jiao fell from 53 yuan to around 51.5 yuan, and Number 2 Saigon fell from 54.4 yuan to 53 yuan. The closing market situation was still soft. Siamese rice still had telegrams, and Xiao Jiao rice was quoted at 61 yuan. Yesterday, there was a counteroffer of 60 yuan for 4,000 electric orders. If an agreement can be reached, the market will fall in the future.

Foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again yesterday, transported by Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng ship from Hong Kong, totaling 6,260 bags, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession to unload.

There were no domestic rice shipments of thick or thin Japonica rice yesterday. Off-market rumors said that the holiday rush had been too high, with special Japonica rice approaching the 60 yuan mark. General customers felt that it was difficult to promote sales, and transactions decreased suddenly. The situation felt weak. Chang group Wuxi special clear Japonica rice was 589 yuan. Chang Kun Japonica special was 578 yuan, second grade was 556 yuan, Qing Si thick and thin was 556 yuan, and Nan Gang early rice was 55.5 yuan.

The market for glutinous rice was also good and shouted vigorously during the initial rise of foreign rice in the morning, but later failed to take off, and due to the fatigue of other goods, it also slackened. The results showed that the actual prices remained unchanged, with no difference. Jin Li special was still 47 yuan, Chang Dan white was 456 yuan, and Jiang Bei white was 434 yuan.

### Flour Mills Limit Supply to Customers

The flour market continued to be firm and strong. The price for Number 1 flour mill remained at 13.8 yuan, and the price for customer purchases gradually became strong. Although it was as high as 15.75 yuan, the supply was still limited. It was heard that both northern and southern groups had sporadic purchases, and local retail transactions also increased. This is because the flour inventory in the inland is almost exhausted, and the Shun Feng brand had already opened at more than 13.8 yuan, but it had not yet been sold. The number of old car brand recycled goods has also decreased. The tightness of the market is truly due to problems with the source of new wheat. Although remedial measures are being prepared, there is still no sign of transport.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Min Group Actively Purchases New Broad Beans; Soybean Market Advances Strongly

The new broad beans are not arriving in large quantities, and transactions are mostly negotiated off-market. It was heard that the Jiading white-skinned broad beans and Qing-skinned broad beans that arrived the previous day were traded the previous night, purchased by the Xiamen and Quanzhou groups. The white-skinned beans were priced at 19 yuan due to slightly heavy mud, and the North Sea group temporarily took a wait-and-see approach. The Qing-skinned beans were priced at 19.5 yuan. Yesterday, the local merchants inquired about more than 150 bags of white-skinned beans, priced at 19 yuan and 17 yuan. The Guang group and local merchants took more than 300 bags of Qing-skinned and white beans, priced at 20 yuan for the local merchants and 20.8 yuan for the Bei Gang. The soybean market is moving steadily upwards. Oil pressing plants and sales outlets are very popular due to rising oil prices and excellent bean cakes. Therefore, both Japanese and Chinese merchants have eager buying appetite. The number of exports from local merchants is even greater, but the buying interest is strong and sellers are short, so the number of transactions has decreased. In the end, only more than 4,000 bags of various beans were traded.

On the 5th, 189 bags of beans were exported to Hong Kong, 780 bags were exported to Singapore, and 500 cans of vegetable oil were exported to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Slightly Up

Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained tight. At the association's opening, prices were initially firm but later softened. Spot prices for second-grade coarse white local warehouse goods reached 75 yuan in the morning, and 73.8 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 1.8 yuan compared to the morning of the previous day. Foreign warehouse goods rose about one yuan in the morning, initially at 74.4 to 74.7 yuan, then to 74.2 yuan, before easing back to 73.5 yuan in the afternoon, only a slight increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Spot transshipment goods started at 60.3 to 60 yuan, then rose to 59 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan. Fourteenth day warehouse receipts were at 61.2 to 60 yuan, a rise of about one yuan. Taikoo Granulated White B mark was at 85.3 yuan, up 1.3 yuan. H mark car red was at 60 yuan, Dutch red was at 62 yuan, up one yuan. Our factory’s snow-white sugar was at 74.5 yuan, up 2.5 yuan. Number one rock sugar was at 96 yuan, crystal clear rock sugar was at 97.5 yuan, up 3.5 yuan. National sugar had Jianbang release 250 bags of Japanese-delivered Qing sugar at 63 yuan, up 0.5 yuan.

Couple's Knowledge

### The Ever-Changing Nature of Love

— Co-authored by Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine, and Zhan Nianzeng, Venereal Disease Specialist

(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road

(Time) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed on Sundays

It is necessary for a man's energy to continuously increase…

Although it is said: "Do not be fickle like Qin in the morning and Chu in the evening," neither men nor women should do such things. However, it is human nature to like the new and dislike the old. Therefore, a clever wife will always change her clothes, her appearance, and the furnishings and arrangements in the home. Sometimes, she may even change the terms, gestures, expressions, and smiles she uses in their love life... all to win her husband's favor. How fortunate is the husband to have such a clever and wonderful wife!

Because human nature is to like the new and dislike the old, love needs to be ever-changing. If it is always the same old thing, the husband of a dull wife may cry out with the sentiment of "domestic flowers are not as fragrant as wildflowers!" This is from the wife's perspective. From the husband's perspective: Men are in a proactive position in marital love, especially in the era of modern women. If the wife is using her loving skills, and the husband cannot harmonize with them, making the love life joyful and coordinated, this is most irritating to the wife. However, if a husband wants to make his marital love life fulfilling, in addition to love skills, he also needs a healthy body and abundant energy. Only then can the couple's life be like glue, full of joy and pleasure from morning to night, giving birth to clever children, and forming a happy family. How wonderful is this! However, if a man has committed self-indulgence, nocturnal emission, or promiscuous indulgence in his early years, and has depleted the endocrine fluid in his reproductive glands, then symptoms such as impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, neurasthenia, thin sperm and infertility, and premature aging will successively arise. Such a sick husband, the more he has a charming wife and beautiful concubines, the more he will bungle things in their love life, or even be completely unable to perform, making the couple's relationship nominal. Over time, this will cause her to waste her youth and sacrifice the happiness of her life. How can this not arouse her hatred, leading to various family tragedies such as elopement and divorce?

Love is moving forward in an ever-changing way, and it is necessary for a man's energy to continuously increase. If a man already has the above-mentioned symptoms, he must take decisive action to completely cure his hidden ailments, and never procrastinate and mislead himself and others! The treatment method for the above-mentioned symptoms is that world-renowned doctors all recommend taking the reproductive gland reciprocation preparation "Shengzhi Hu" as the most effective and targeted treatment. This agent is based on the most advanced supplementation therapy principle in modern medicine. It extracts the endocrine essence from the reproductive glands of strong animals such as apes, gorillas, tigers, wolves, bears, deer, and sea dogs, and is refined into an agent using scientific replication methods. Therefore, the value of its quality and the certainty of its efficacy are unmatched by any similar preparation. Therefore, after taking it, a man can produce sperm and tonify the kidneys, invigorate the brain and blood overnight. Continued use will further promote development, nourish nerves, and regulate metabolism, and will surely cure all symptoms in the short term. It will strengthen energy and make love fulfilling. Only those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hximituo's Essence-Consolidating Tablets" (available at large pharmacies such as Sino-Western Wuzhou Huamei Taihe) to consolidate the essence gate, stop leakage, and achieve even faster results.

Beauty

### The Source of Happiness is the Breasts

— American Medical Doctorate Yao Chongpei

Having bathed, she ventures out for an evening stroll,

Her graceful figure surpassing all others,

The twin peaks subtly revealed beneath her attire,

Capturing the gaze of every passerby.

Clad in the sheerest of garments, her silhouette is so enchanting, her curves so defined. Adding to this, her breasts, gently rising and falling beneath the thin fabric, evoke envy and secret admiration. Indeed, the love of beauty is an innate human desire. No matter how foolish one may be, the sight of a healthy, beautiful woman, a woman with well-developed features, evokes admiration. In today's world, where "healthy beauty" for women is highly touted, they are seen as angels from heaven, or treasures of society. Everyone shows them respect and care, giving them an advantage in social settings. Broadly speaking, in any circumstance, they enjoy material and spiritual fulfillment and pleasure.

But, let's consider the other side. "Healthy beauty" is not something every woman possesses. If a woman has previously suffered from chest binding, menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, anemia, hemoptysis, or severe illnesses, the function of her reproductive glands and ovaries will be impaired. This will affect her metabolism, and her breasts will not develop properly. Even if they have developed well, they will gradually atrophy, becoming as flat as a man's. At the same time, her hips will become thin and lacking in flesh, losing their roundness and fullness. The loveliness of a woman, to put it plainly, lies entirely in her breasts and hips. If her breasts are as flat as a man's, where is the beauty that would cause infatuation and adoration? Therefore, women who have lost their healthy beauty, despite past happiness, often face a tragic fate. As for remedies, both Chinese and Western doctors agree that taking women's "Germinal Essence" is the most effective treatment. This agent was invented by German Doctor Staner, and its noble ingredients and precise formulation surpass any other endocrine preparation. Once taken, it exerts a powerful effect within 24 hours, regulating menstruation and developing mammary glands. Continued use will surely conquer the above symptoms, making the breasts round and high, the cheeks rosy, and maintaining youthfulness.

### Effective Treatment for Spermatorrhea

— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Some say that spermatorrhea in young men is not a disease. Others say that while it is a disease, it is difficult to treat. These two misconceptions exist in the minds of young men with spermatorrhea, delaying the treatment and harming their futures! Spermatorrhea may not be a disease, but it can cost a life! A certain expert physician once said in a research report, "One instance of spermatorrhea is worse than losing a pound of blood!" Its severity is such that spermatorrhea is not comparable to ordinary diseases; it is simply the most harmful disease. However, while spermatorrhea is the most harmful disease, it is not a difficult disease to treat. Ordinary people call it difficult to treat because they do not understand the root cause and have no effective medicines. According to our investigations, countless young men with spermatorrhea are fooled by incompetent doctors, wasting time and money and delaying treatment. As a result, spermatorrhea increases daily, and the nervous system weakens. Symptoms such as weakened memory, insomnia, palpitations, lower back pain, incomplete development, and premature aging arise, burying their youth and delaying their futures. Is this not tragic?

The reason why young people suffer from spermatorrhea is mostly due to masturbation, excessive indulgence, or overwork, which injures the sexual nerves and causes the spermatic duct to relax. Knowing this root cause, the treatment must focus on strengthening the spermatic duct. Taking "Hymitol's Spermatic Solidifying Pills" has the specific effect of strengthening the spermatic duct, calming the nerves, and stopping spermatorrhea. According to my experience, I have used this agent to cure tens of thousands of spermatorrhea patients. However, for those who have had spermatorrhea for a long time and have the above symptoms, it is necessary to also take the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" to nourish the brain, kidneys, sperm, blood, and nerves. Taking it continuously for a month will surely eliminate all ailments and double their energy. This is truly the most effective treatment for spermatorrhea, treating both the symptoms and the root cause. Patients who can come to my clinic in person for treatment will find it especially reliable, with visible results in days.

### Ironclad Facts

— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng Records

(1) Young men with spermatorrhea should not delay treatment

Mr. Qiao Rongzu, 20 years old, from Ningbo, came to Shanghai last year due to the frequent bombings in his hometown. He boarded at a certain middle school in Shanghai. However, the environment in Shanghai was too dissolute, and the school lacked good educational facilities. Boarding students could often go out for leisure. Once, he was pulled into prostitution and aroused lustful thoughts, resulting in masturbation. He did not know that once masturbation becomes a habit, it is easy to cause the spermatic duct to relax and trigger spermatorrhea. Initially, it was only two or three times a month, but gradually increased to five or six or ten times. As a result, his face was sallow, his memory was poor, his head was dizzy and achy, he had tinnitus and blurred vision, his limbs were tired, and he had lower back pain. His schoolwork also plummeted as a result. Before the spring break, he failed the exams. Mr. Qiao now realized the harm of masturbation and spermatorrhea, but repeatedly taking over-the-counter medicines had little effect. Last month, he came to my clinic for treatment, determined to cure his disease. After a detailed examination by an expert physician, it was determined that it was indeed due to untreated spermatorrhea. He was immediately instructed to go to the Sino-Western Pharmacy to purchase two boxes of the special spermatorrhea drug "Hymitol's Spermatic Solidifying Pills" and two dozen of the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" to take together. He was also given "Diement's" electrotherapy every other day. After three weeks of careful treatment, his spirits were revitalized, his mind was clear, and the above symptoms had completely disappeared.

(2) The husband's sorrow after marriage

Mr. Gao Ming, 26 years old, got married last winter. There has never been harmony between the couple because Mr. Gao developed impotence after marriage and had slight spermatorrhea. The couple's relationship was unusually poor, but Mr. Gao's inner pain could not be described in words. Although he had taken so-called "kidney tonifying and sperm producing endocrine agents" on the market with little effect, he was even more frustrated! Last month, introduced by his friend (his friend Mr. Gu also cured his hidden illness at this clinic), he came to my clinic for treatment. After examining his condition, he was instructed to purchase three dozen of the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" and one box of "Hymitol's Spermatic Solidifying Pills" to take together. He was also given daily electrotherapy and injections of new medical techniques. A month has passed, and he is now strong and vigorous, and the couple's love is indescribable.

### Statement by the French Concession Taxpayers' Association: Increased Taxes are Unbearable, May Cause Rent Increases and High Prices. Letter to the French Municipal Council Requesting Reconsideration, and Appointing Representatives to Negotiate with Authorities to Restrict Rent Increases.

The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, in view of the difficult living conditions of residents within the concession, sent a special letter to the French Municipal Council yesterday regarding the implementation of increased taxes starting next month, requesting reconsideration and urging price stabilization. They also resolved to appoint four representatives to be responsible for negotiating with the authorities to restrict illegal rent increases, in order to stabilize the livelihood of residents within the concession. The details are as follows:

Ordinary Tax Increases are Beyond Capacity

The French Municipal Council, in order to balance the budget, has decided to increase land tax, house tax, vehicle tax, etc., starting July 1st, to supplement funds. However, at this time of difficult living, taxpayers feel unable to bear the burden. The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, in addition to requesting the Chinese director of the council to negotiate reasonably, sent a special letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, requesting reconsideration. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, we have learned that your council intends to implement a general increase in various taxes, such as land tax, house tax, and vehicle licenses, starting July 1st of this year. The rate of increase is as high as 40% or more, which is an unprecedented precedent. Since the westward shift of the war, Shanghai has become an isolated island. Our French Concession is in a corner, and the number of residents has increased sharply. Various businesses show signs of prosperity, but examining the overall social situation, there is a risk of gradual depletion. The people are struggling to make a living, which is deeply worrying. The rate of increase in land tax and house tax is particularly large this time. Landlords are bound to use this as an excuse to increase rents even more. At this time, tenants will naturally be unable to afford it. Therefore, rent disputes will continue to escalate. Furthermore, if the increased taxes trigger another rise in prices, it will not only run counter to the principle of stabilizing prices, but also affect the security of the concession. Moreover, previous council settlements have shown annual surpluses, and this tax increase seems unnecessary. While increasing revenue is important, reducing expenditure is also essential. We respectfully submit our humble opinions, hoping that your council will prioritize the livelihood of the people and reconsider it carefully. We specially send this letter, hoping for a reply."

Urging Restrictions on Illegal Rent Increases

The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, in view of the repeated occurrence of landlords increasing rents within the concession, and the citizens being unable to bear the soaring prices, has led to repeated disputes. The committee members have repeatedly discussed and reached a result, appointing four representatives to be responsible for negotiating with the French authorities to restrict illegal rent increases. These four representatives are two landlords and two tenants, to study and obtain a fair method through both sides, so that opportunists have no excuse. The representatives decided yesterday include Mr. Xu Maotang as one of the landlords, and the remaining landlord and two tenants are still being sought.

### Rise of Bankrupt Yarn Companies, Reaching 90, 30 Already Liquidated, 60 Not Yet Announced

Black market speculation in cotton yarn is rampant, and yarn prices are fluctuating drastically, causing many companies to lose money and go bankrupt. Yesterday, Rende, Shenyu, and Dinglong also announced the suspension of business and liquidation, and the hidden worries have not subsided.

After the Shanghai War

Yarn manufacturers, initially for the convenience of buying and selling spot goods, established a tea party-style dark market through the business research association of the Yarn Industry Association, specializing in spot transactions and strictly complying with government orders not to engage in futures. However, it did not take long for unscrupulous elements in the yarn industry to seize the opportunity and illegally establish so-called "Intermediary Societies," turning the spot organization into an illegal futures trading market. Moreover, they bought and sold Japanese yarn, attracting more than 300 outside participants. There were also

four to five hundred

who participated in the market under the names of other companies without formally joining. These people in the market only cared about their own interests and disregarded national laws and the people's livelihood. The Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs repeatedly ordered them to prohibit trading in futures and Japanese yarn, but they turned a deaf ear and continued to operate as usual, intensifying blind speculation, disrupting the market, and leading to suicides and bankruptcies due to manipulation and speculation by certain large yarn companies. Last month, the yarn price jumped from 800 yuan to 1,800 yuan, and then fell to 1,200 yuan,

causing all bulls and bears

to suffer huge losses. Therefore, bankruptcies have been rising until now. It is reported that about 30 companies have announced liquidation, and about 60 have not yet announced liquidation. These are all those who failed in trading Japanese yarn and are not legitimate yarn merchants of the Yarn Exchange. Those who failed and went bankrupt this time

speculated in "Moon Harp"

Japanese yarn last month, with an average of about 3,000 bales of "Moon Harp" Japanese yarn per company. It is also learned that the

debts

of each bankrupt yarn company range from 50,000 to 300,000 yuan, and some even have debts of several million yuan. Among them, some have indeed gone bankrupt due to losses, while others have deliberately taken the opportunity to go bankrupt.

### British Troops Capture Two Thugs, Confiscate Important Documents, Currently Studying Documents and Firearms, May Have Shocking Revelations

The North-China Daily News reported that yesterday (3rd) at 9:10 am, a team of the 2nd Battalion of the British East Surrey Regiment was patrolling along Edinburgh Road when a group of armed Chinese men without uniforms scattered and fled as the patrol approached. However, two were captured by British soldiers, one

carrying a gun and ammunition

and several documents of significant importance were seized from his person. The British military authorities are still detaining the two men and are investigating with the Shanghai Municipal Police. The China Press also reported that the Shanghai Municipal Police continued to study the firearms and documents seized by the British troops this morning (4th), and the details are unknown. According to a police officer, the seized firearms cannot be identified in a short time, and the documents will also take several days

to translate.

Because the police investigation has not been completed, no news has been released. One theory is that the two arrested men are related to secret political plots. Their arrest will have shocking revelations. The two men are still being detained by the East Surrey Regiment and are expected to be handed over to the police for questioning in court.

### 13 Bridges on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway Have Been Burned, New Fourth Army Operates in the Changshu Area, White Bridge Construction is Huge and Difficult to Repair

According to recent reports from the countryside, the Changshu section of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway has been severely damaged by the New Fourth Army, with as many as 13 bridges of various sizes burned. Traffic on the road has been stopped for four days and is unlikely to return to normal in a short time. Since the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway fell into Japanese hands, it has been relied on as a key transportation route for troops. The "Central China Railway Company" operated by the Japanese also opened vehicles to travel between Suzhou, Wuxi, Shanghai, and Changshu, earning considerable profits.

The Suzhou-Changshu section

has been repeatedly damaged by guerrillas, but was eventually blocked by the Japanese army, who converted the river into a mud dam for forced passage. Recently, the New Fourth Army learned that the Japanese army was about to make a large-scale deployment, so on the night of the 1st of this month, they sent mobile troops from the west to destroy a large number of bridges on the Changshu section, from Bridge No. 62 in Zhitang to Bridge No. 49 in Gulicun, all burned down, and the burning

lasted a whole day.

Although Japanese troops were stationed in the nearby town of Zhitang, they did not dare to attack due to the planned actions of the Chinese army. It was not until noon the next day that they went out and forced the villagers to extinguish the fire. After the incident, residents along the line, such as Zhitang, Baimao, Zhitang, and Yaozhen, were concerned about this situation and feared that it would lead to combat, so they moved one after another. It was then learned that the purpose of the Chinese army was to disrupt the Japanese army's transportation line, so after the event, they still

retreated westward.

In order to maintain transportation, the Japanese army urgently needs to repair the damaged bridges, but the White Bridge is a huge project, and the river is difficult to block with mud due to tidal influences. It is estimated to take at least two months. The "Central China Railway Company's" passenger cars have stopped, and the Shanghai-Changshu transport companies operated by the Chinese have changed their routes to transport goods.

### Safety Movement, Jointly Promoted

Due to the sharp increase in Shanghai's population after the war and the frequent traffic on the roads, the Municipal Council launched a Safe Driving Week from June 18th to 24th last year to reduce traffic accidents. In the past year, accidents have been reduced. Therefore, it is scheduled to continue the safety campaign with the French Concession authorities starting on the 18th of this month. The organization is divided into Chinese Motor Vehicle Group, Private Car Group, Motorcycle Group, Trolley Group, and Rickshaw Group, inviting responsible persons from all parties to guide the work of each group. The Traffic Department and Police Department of the Municipal Council also jointly formulated publicity methods. At that time, in addition to posting slogans and leaflets on vehicles and utility poles, it was also decided to screen movies, broadcast publicity, and mobilize Boy Scouts to guide pedestrian traffic on various roads.

### Zha Peilin et al. Donate to the Belgian Red Cross

The Belgian Red Cross has raised $116,383.50 in Chinese currency in China as of recently. Among them, Zha Peilin, Director of the Shanghai Postal Bureau, donated 100 yuan in foreign currency, and Fap, Director of the French Concession Police Department, donated 100 yuan. Other foreign currency donations included 127,681.25 Belgian francs, 3,500 French francs, 39 pounds and 1 penny in British gold, and 695 US dollars.

### Xue Gengxin's Resignation Approved

Xue Gengxin, Chief Translator and Inspector of the Political Department of the French Police Department, has been hospitalized for more than a month due to illness caused by overwork. Now that he urgently needs to recuperate, he has submitted his resignation, which has been approved.

### Shanghai Maritime Customs Port Affairs Department Dredges the Huangpu Waterway, First Carried Out in Two Steps in the Chenjiazhui Area, Stipulating Navigation Measures for the Construction Area

In view of the urgent need to dredge the Huangpu River waterway to facilitate navigation and traffic, the Shanghai Maritime Customs has dispatched the dredger Haihu from the Port Affairs Department to dredge the main waterway in the Chenjiazhui area starting yesterday. The announcement is recorded as follows: "The dredger Haihu of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau will carry out dredging work in the main waterway of the Huangpu River in the Chenjiazhui area, from about 3,800 feet downstream of the Donggou Buoy (New Waterway No. 6 Buoy of Gaoqiao Sand) to about 2,200 feet upstream of the Donggou Buoy.

This dredging

project is scheduled to start on June 4th of this year, and will be carried out in two steps. The first step is to dredge the Shanghai riverbank in the above area, from the lower end to the upstream. The second step is to dredge the Pudong riverbank, also from the lower end to the upstream. When the dredger is working and resting, it will moor in the deep waterway near Shanghai or Pudong in the above area. During this project, ship operators navigating ships in the Huangpu River should

be extremely cautious

when approaching the dredger. Keep safe at the slowest possible speed and sound a long whistle so that the dredger's master can assess the situation and stop the dredger from moving sideways. The working signals of the dredger shown in this department's Announcement No. 10 of August 25, 1932, must be noted. In addition to the previous signals, a white sign is hung at both ends of the dredger, marked with the word "Dredger," and lights are used at night for illumination. In addition, all navigators

must not ignore

that there are two lateral anchor chains on the side of the dredger close to the waterway. Therefore, passing ships should not get too close to the dredger. Also, when ships are approaching the dredger, the ship behind must not overtake the ship in front or pass the oncoming ship. The drawing of this dredging project can be obtained from the department and the Pilotage Association, or the Engineering Department of the Dredging Bureau. Let all navigators know this and hold this announcement."

### Ningbo and Shaoxing Native Place Associations Discuss Relief for Rice Shortage, Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Still Plan to Increase Freight, Drought in Shiqi Leads to Hopeless Harvest

The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association, to solicit donations for rice at low prices in Ningbo, the chairman committee Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runxiang, Zhang Jixian, etc., scheduled to convene a Ningbo fellow townspeople appeal conference on the 7th of this month, yesterday issued a notice saying: "Our Ningbo has a small area and dense population, and the food supply has always been insufficient. Recently, due to the exhaustion of rice sources, there is a sudden panic. In mid-last month, the price of rice soared to more than 60 yuan, and there is no worry about buying it. Small people can hardly make a living. And when the spring sowing season is now approaching, there has been little rain, and most of the early rice has withered, making people uneasy and worried every day. The welfare of our native place is closely related to us. In addition to the active fund-raising of rice transportation to help and organize flat prices, this matter is important and relies on the efforts of all to be effective. We have set a special time at five o'clock on the afternoon of the 7th of this month to hold a fundraising conference at this association. All our fellow townspeople who are enthusiastic will participate together to support justice and will be grateful."

Shipping Freight Still Planned to Increase

The Ningbo People's Food Relief Association, in view of the severe rice shortage, plans to levy a 5% relief fee on all imports and exports and imported goods in the warehouse that have not been collected, according to customs valuation. However, due to the firm opposition of fellow townspeople in Shanghai, it was decided to change the Shanghai-Ningbo ships to increase the shipping freight by 50% back and forth for relief. The local Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Shanghai to Yu Qiaqing seeking opinions. At that time, Yu replied that he did not agree, advocated more donations, and first advanced 500,000 yuan from Shanghai to order 18,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which was loaded on the Granton wheel and went directly from Hong Kong to Ningbo. At the same time, the steps were decided to prepare to order a total of 100,000 bags of rice in two steps for relief. The Xin Sheng News reporter inquired from the shipping industry that the Ningbo People's Food Relief Association plans to implement a relief fee on all import and export ships from the 6th of this month, adding 50% to the shipping freight to meet the needs of relieving the people's food.

### British Residents in Shanghai Await Orders to Enlist

Since the outbreak of the European war, the British Consulate has announced that young and strong British residents in Shanghai have been actively returning to their country to participate in the war. Other British residents, regardless of age or gender, are also highly motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and are willing to serve their country. According to a message released yesterday by the British Consulate in Shanghai, "Since the outbreak of the European war, the British government has authorized the British Ambassador to inform British residents that those who wish to return to England to participate in the war can first exert their patriotic enthusiasm in the British dominions as much as possible, or represent the interests of the British Crown in the region where the expatriates are currently located, to provide better service. As the European war has gradually expanded, the British Consul-General in Shanghai has also informed the government of the expatriates' willingness to return to their country to participate in service in any capacity, and asked the government if it would object to raising funds in Shanghai to help them achieve their goals if it is inconvenient to arrange for these volunteer teams to return to England.

### Japanese Merchant "Market" Transporting Salted Pork Suddenly Attacked by Civilian Boats, Armed Robbery, Japanese Escorting Goods Beaten and Injured, Serious Case of Power Struggle

According to the Social News Agency, at around 4:00 PM on the third, five Japanese staff members from the "Shanghai Food Market," a Japanese merchant located at No. 61 Wusong Road, escorted three hundred head of salted pork on a small boat to the Pudong Public Wharf. Unexpectedly, three small boats carrying over two hundred men armed with iron rods and other weapons suddenly arrived and surrounded the Japanese merchant's pork boat. The five Japanese escorting the pork were beaten and injured, and the attackers fled immediately after shouting. After the Japanese side received the news, they immediately went to pursue them, but there was no trace of them. The injured were taken to the Muhara Hospital on Lao Baizi Road. The Japanese side learned that the attacking ships were flying the flag of "Central Market," so they are investigating the truth.

Gathering to Rob

According to the Sixth Central News Agency, at 4:00 PM on the [blank space] day (the 3rd), Oyauchi Yuzo, the transportation group leader of the Japanese merchant "Shanghai Food Market" in Wusong, and his group members Hokuhara Asakichi, Kanda Yoshiji, Noda Tatsumi, and Kaizu Takanori, were transporting 300 heads of salted pork from Pudong, intending to unload the goods at the public wharf. Unexpectedly, when they were about 300 meters away from the wharf, three civilian boats flying the false flag of "Central Market" sailed out of Suzhou Creek and surrounded the salted pork boat. About 200 Chinese men, each holding iron weapons, attacked Oyauchi and others. After robbing all 300 heads of salted pork, they fled back upstream on Suzhou Creek. It is said that Oyauchi and others were seriously injured, but their lives are not in danger, and they are being treated at the Taihara Hospital on Lao Baizi Road.

Not the First Time

It is reported that the incident of robbing goods in the Huangpu River is not the first time. About a month ago, there were incidents of robbing pork and other goods. On the 2nd of this month, at 10:00 AM, when a certain ship was transporting salted pork for the "Shanghai Food Market," someone threatened them and ordered them to go to Huishan Wharf. However, none of the previous cases were as serious as this one. It is said that the stolen salted pork is worth no less than 150,000 to 160,000 yuan.

Japanese Interview

After this incident occurred, Oyauchi said that for more than a month, the "Market's" cargo ships often encountered Chinese people claiming to be from the "Central Market" on the way, saying that the goods belonged to the "Central Market" and ordering them to dock at Huishan Wharf. After investigation, there is no trading relationship between the "Market" and the "Central Market," and the "Market" has no reason to have disputes with the "Market." This incident is suspected to be the work of pirate ships flying the flag of the "Central Market." As for whether it was done by employees of the "Central Market," it is impossible to speculate before the authorities have investigated it thoroughly.

### Astonishing Amount of Apple Imports This Spring

The apples sold in Shanghai mostly come from Japan and Korea. According to the Great Eastern News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Jianghai Customs, the figures are quite considerable. The import value of apples from January to March this year was 239,978 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to 649,620 yuan in national currency. During the same period last year, it was only 119,785 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to only 267,297 yuan in national currency. This year, it is almost more than twice as much. Among the countries importing apples, Japan ranks first, accounting for 130,921 Customs Gold Units, Korea ranks second, accounting for 103,260 Customs Gold Units, and the United States ranks third, accounting for 3,360 Customs Gold Units.

Truly Astonishing

At the same time, Xia Ping, the general affairs section chief of the pseudo-"Central Market," also gave a statement, saying that the incident of pirate ships flying the flag of the "Central Market" and attacking the "Shanghai Food Market" was heard for the first time. He believes that this kind of violent incident must have been done by unscrupulous elements, and they have no motivation or reason to do so. However, it is also a fact that there has been some confusion in the salted pork transaction between the "Central Market" and the "Shanghai Market" since the beginning of last month, which has not yet been resolved. And the goods robbed from the "Shanghai Market" this time happened to be salted pork, which is truly amazing. He hopes that the world will not misunderstand because of this.

Case Speculation

The reporter believes that this matter is indeed very peculiar, and consulted those who are familiar with the local situation in Shanghai for their views. According to them, although incidents of robbery in the Huangpu River occur occasionally, the large-scale operation of this case is indeed rare. Moreover, the robbers did not escape in different directions in the river, but still returned upstream on Suzhou Creek in three ships, without considering that the principal might report to the authorities to pursue and intercept them, which is even more strange. Based on this, we judge the case and think it is half understood.

### Java Conscripts Young Men

A Group of Overseas Chinese Conscripted into the Army, Limited to Carrying 500 Guilders Out of the Country. The Chibadak ship of the Java Mailboat Company left Southeast Asia and sailed to Shanghai after the Netherlands became involved in the war. According to the overseas Chinese who took the ship to Shanghai, after the Netherlands was drawn into the whirlpool and then the situation in the Dutch East Indies became tense, the Java authorities have taken all wartime measures. Recently, it has been stipulated that young men should be conscripted to defend the local area, and foreigners are also included in the conscription. The method is that each shop must transfer one young man to be trained by the Java authorities for the needs of defending the country when necessary. Therefore, not a few overseas Chinese have been conscripted. The first batch has been conscripted into the army. As for the business of the stores, they have stopped operating at night due to the implementation of lighting control.

Restrictions on Foreigners Taking Silver Out of the Country

In order to implement wartime financial management, the Java authorities have restricted foreigners from taking silver out of the country. The limit is 500 Dutch guilders per person. More will be confiscated. Therefore, the overseas Chinese returning to their country this time cannot carry Dutch currency out of the country without restrictions. The authorities have now imposed control over various items in Java. Stores should record the goods sold for verification, and at the same time assess the prices and do not allow merchants to raise prices arbitrarily.

Large Number of Overseas Chinese Preparing to Return Home

Currently, the overseas Chinese in Java are affected and restricted by their business abroad, so most of them are preparing to return home. After the Chibadak, the Chizhalianka ship sailed from Southeast Asia to Shanghai, carrying about a thousand overseas Chinese to Shanghai. It is heard that the ship will arrive in Shanghai around the 10th of this month. The Chibadak ship is scheduled to continue sailing from Shanghai to Southeast Asia on the 6th.

The men's room will be in Mingxin Temple, and the women's room will be in Lishan Temple. Each will be assigned to their respective locations for class study, to prevent mixing. Second, the bureau will have four silkworm masters and two silkworm women, starting on the seventeenth day of the third month and ending on the seventeenth day of the fourth month, staying at the bureau full-time for sixty days. Third, the price of mulberry leaves is variable. Now that the bureau is established for teaching, it is a matter of public service. All households with mulberry trees should have a sense of urgency and public interest and must not raise prices or hoard them. When silkworms are entering their large sleep or beginning to eat a lot of leaves, officials and gentry in the bureau shall consult and decide on prices fairly, weighing them and paying accordingly. They must not go back on their word or attempt to monopolize, thereby hindering this good deed. Fourth, all silkworm rearing and silk reeling tools must be easy to use. As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." Currently, the bureau has selected and purchased one or two of these tools from Huzhou. Those who come to learn with a genuine interest in this matter should observe them carefully to learn how to replicate them. Silk reeling machines are especially important. Knowing how to raise silkworms but not how to reel silk is a common problem in Ningbo. The key lies in not knowing how to build a reeling machine. Those with ambition can discuss the matter with officials and gentry in the bureau after the event, borrow a sample, and hire craftsmen to replicate it. Fifth, diligence and thrift are essential for sericulture. Except for committee members in the bureau, who are allowed to bring one family servant, all other laborers will be hired by the gentry and directors as needed.

To be published tomorrow:

Spring and Autumn

### Star of Life (3)

We must also know that it is not only darkness that obscures the stars, making them invisible to us. Can you see the stars during the day? You cannot. This is not because the stars are not there, but because the sunlight is brighter. We only see the sunlight and not the stars. Likewise, it is not only suffering, illness, death, etc., that obscure God, making Him invisible to us. When we are at peace and happy, our eyes filled with worldly glory and wealth, we are also very easily caught in this danger, which is not seeing the star of life. There is a way to see the stars during the day, which is to go down a well and look up at the sky. If we want to see this star of life, which is always close to us and guides us, we must put in the effort, temporarily putting aside worldly affairs and drawing closer to Him. There is also another meaning: this "bright morning star" is a sign of the rising sun. When you are walking at night, feeling hardship and difficulty, cold and lonely, everything feels dull and cumbersome, when you see the morning star appearing in the east, your spirits are renewed, because you know that this dark and dangerous night is about to pass. It is the same when the star Christ rises and shines in our hearts. In other words, when Christ is no longer just an empty name to us, but our best living friend, it is the prelude to the passing of our doubts, sins, selfishness, dangers, and the darkness of death. When we see the morning star, we are happy, not only because the night is going to pass, but also because the day is coming. We know that the sun will rise and shine all over the earth in a short time. When the star Christ shines in our lives, we rejoice, not only because all the suffering of life will pass, but also because the happy days of heaven are coming, when God will wipe away all tears from our eyes and give us eternal happiness. (The End)

### Please Forgive Me

— Editor

Answering Readers Regarding Zhang Yisheng's "Seeking Employment"

First, I must state: I do not know Zhang Yisheng. This can be proven by his second letter. However, the reason I made an exception and published this free advertisement for him is that, on the one hand, I sympathize with his situation, and on the other hand, I feel that many young masters who have such privileged backgrounds treat their studies as a game, even forging checks and stealing coats in dance halls. Seeing such a pitiful student makes them also aware. Moreover, many schools now only know how to increase fees and have no time for work such as rewarding students with excellent academics and conduct, and treating poor students preferentially. Therefore, in addition to "Seeking Employment," I specifically raised this "request."

However, unexpectedly, and to my embarrassment, many letters came hoping to also publish "Seeking Employment" examples. Some even took the initiative, saying that I certainly would not be more generous to him and stingy to them; some suspected that Zhang Yisheng was my relative or friend, otherwise, why would I be so "enthusiastic"? Regardless of whether these words are "inviting" or "provoking," I sympathize with them very much because they hope to find a job under the pressure of rising living standards. However, I really cannot add another "Self-Introduction" column in the current narrow space. As for some letters with extreme words, I fully accept them because I have already been "meddlesome."

Please forgive everything, and I will not reply to each letter individually.

### The Death of a Little Life

— Guo Lian

The refugee crisis has created a superficial prosperity in Shanghai. In the building where we have our shop, residential households account for 70-80%, so there are especially many children. From those held in arms upward, the number probably exceeds the total number of adults. The air is filled with the noisy sounds of children all day long, and there is practically no time to be quiet unless a black curtain descends from the sky.

Today is suddenly different! While the sun is still hanging high in the sky, for ten minutes, the noisy sounds of children disappeared.

Before these ten minutes arrived, it began with a fat woman directing her children to hide inside our shop, and she did not allow any of them to stand in a place where they could see anything outside the door; there were also no traces of children in the courtyard or the living room.

Because my ears are accustomed to noisy sounds, at this time, I felt the air especially deadly and terrifying.

Later, I found out that because the house is small and there are many people, and the weather has become hot in the past two days, the air is especially stifling. Under these circumstances, on the upper floor, a child in the Ningbo wife's home was sacrificed. A small child - was taken out in a cattail bag. The time when this building was suddenly different was precisely when this small shell, now separated from its soul, was put into a cattail bag, ready to be carried downstairs. The reason why the children hid: it is said that if children see a dead child, they will have "misfortune" themselves in the future. Although there was still a cattail bag outside, their parents seriously hid them to prevent them from seeing it and having future "misfortune." Therefore, this ten minutes of dead silence was created.

But why did this "misfortune" especially befall this dead child? Was it because his parents neglected him before he was alive and let him see another dead child? But I can say: Oh! A hundred ohs...! Because from the day this little life came into the world, I remember that I only tore off forty-one pages from the calendar hanging on the wall, yet he - this little life ended!

He hadn't even reached the gate yet, so where would a dead child have made him meet and cause today's "misfortune"?

This life's misfortune should entirely be attributed to: the narrowness of the house; the stifling air; and especially the parents' negligence! Because the first two can still be attributed to economic limitations.

Parents of the new era, please stop being superstitious about forms! Children are the future masters of China. I hope you, as parents, will properly shoulder the responsibility of nurturing them!

### Why Use a "Pseudonym"?

— Yu

Reading "Spring and Autumn" a few days ago, I learned that a certain "grain of Zhang Yisheng" wrote a letter to the editor of this publication, requesting him to publicly introduce him for a teaching position to help pay for tuition and miscellaneous fees at Yangzhou Middle School next semester. The editor was generous and made an exception; unexpectedly, two days later, an editor's reply said that a Shen Lu called Yangzhou Middle School and said that there was no such person as "Zhang Yisheng" at the school. This made countless readers feel disappointed. It wasn't until June 3 that Zhang wrote a letter saying that "Yisheng" was actually a pseudonym, so "the school authorities could not notify the student."

The matter ended like this, but we want to respectfully ask this "Zhang Yisheng" why did you use a pseudonym? Is it because you were afraid of people knowing that you didn't have tuition? Is it because not having tuition is considered a shameful thing?

I think Zhang's spirit of wanting to work to continue his studies because he has no tuition should be praised by every rational person and is definitely not a shameful thing.

On the contrary, everyone who has the same ambition as Zhang should stand up and imitate (but that doesn't mean everyone should use "Spring and Autumn" as a job introduction agency, because in fact, "Spring and Autumn" doesn't have that much space, and the occupation itself has its own separate methods), break the concept of vanity, and create a way out for themselves!

### "Leaving Quota" Has Gifts

— San San

Before every holiday, in order to count the number of students for the next semester, each school has the practice of paying a "leaving quota fee." Now is naturally the time again. A certain school is even holding a "grand giveaway" to encourage students to "leave their quota" early. The methods are as follows:

Middle school students, 7 yuan per person; elementary school students, 4 yuan per person. Those who pay first will receive drawing paper worth 2 jiao (all stamped with the school seal; ordinary notebooks are also like this, all must be purchased from the school store to show neatness and uniformity); elementary school students who pay first will receive a "voucher" worth 1 jiao from the school store, it is said.

Hawthorne's Detective Cases

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter One: "A very pretty young lady!"

"Anna? Bao Lang, I'm a little confused. Is there a compound surname Anna in the 'Hundred Family Surnames'?"

I replied coldly, "That's not a surname. That's the transliteration of the foreign woman's given name, Anna."

Hawthorne also pretended to suddenly understand and nodded. "Oh, I see. So, I really shouldn't use 'girl' or 'Miss,' I should call her Miss. Right?"

A small patch of white seemed to show in Anna's eyes, but she didn't answer.

Hawthorne said again, "Miss Anna - sigh - sorry, I shouldn't call you that, but there's no other way - may I ask Miss your surname?"

She said unhappily, "Jiang!"

"Oh dear, please forgive my rudeness, but this surname doesn't seem very fitting. This surname Jiang is a Chinese surname that we have in the Hundred Family Surnames!"

Anna became a little uneasy. Not only did white show in her eyes, but the black parts also showed a light of almost annoyance.

"I'm not here to ask you to criticize my surname and name. I'm here to ask you to handle a case." She casually threw most of her cigarette into the ashtray.

Hawthorne looked at her hair and said smoothly, "This hair is dyed perfectly, it really looks like a foreigner's blonde color. If there was a way to dye black eyes petroleum blue, Miss Jiang, I would advise you that it's worth trying!"

Auntie Su walked in to clear the dishes, interrupting Hawthorne's sarcastic words. But Anna wasn't embarrassed, she only showed that kind of resentful look.

"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm here to ask you about a murder case. Why are you making fun of me?"

Her tone had clearly changed, and the "fire" in her expression had also subsided a lot. Hawthorne also nodded.

He said, "I'm very sorry, how dare I joke? This is my contribution... sigh, you say it's a murder case? Who died?" (5)

Entertainment World

### Chaplin's Family Life

— Xin Liang

Chaplin doesn't really like to receive visitors except on Sunday afternoons, because he's really too busy. One Sunday, we went to visit him at his house, his wife, Paulette Goddard, and his two sons.

We arrived at his house at noon. Chaplin had worked too much last night, so he had just gotten up. We all met in the living room.

The walls of the living room were full of the latest popular books, most of which were signed and given to him by the original authors.

As we all walked hand in hand up to his house (built on a steep mountain), he told us how much he loved flowers - their beauty often moved him. "Their easy fading makes me very sad," he said with a smile.

When we walked back down, Paulette had already dressed up. She was playing with a curly-haired dog, and when she saw us, she immediately rushed forward to greet us. I've heard people use the words "phosphorescent" to describe her, and indeed, it couldn't be more fitting. She has a kind of vitality, she doesn't need makeup, she has a tanned skin that can attract you.

Her eyes are also very bright. The eye sockets aren't very big, but they're constantly moving, jumping around, as if they're talking to you.

On Sundays, they usually have lunch under the shade of several big trees next to the swimming pool. On Sundays, Chaplin's two sons, one named Little Chaplin, thirteen years old, and one named Sidney, twelve years old, also come home from military school. Their physiques are also very strong, and they're both full of energy; their actions, although seemingly rough, are very lovable. At meal times, they seem very shy, and they don't say a word to strangers. These two children love Paulette very much, and Paulette, in turn, also likes them. She often goes to their school to visit, watch various ball games, and sometimes, she's the one who gives out the prizes.

Paulette's greatest pleasure is knitting yarn. Whenever she has free time, she'll sit down and knit. "Oh, this is my hobby," she told us: "The wool sweaters and undershirts that I wear myself are all knitted by me. In the photography studio, when the workers are arranging the scenery, etc., I take out my knitting needles and knit clothes. Do you want me to knit you a sweater? I can give you one next Christmas."

After dinner, we all went back to the library. Sometimes, if we're lucky, we'll hear Chaplin play the piano himself. From this, we can know that Chaplin is not only a theatrical genius, but also a musical master. When he feels "bored," he also likes to read aloud a few lines of brilliant text from books.

### The European War on the Silver Screen

— Xin Fang

The outbreak of the European War has caused Hollywood film companies to significantly change their filming policies. On the one hand, to adjust the mood of people around the world, comedies are indispensable; on the other hand, to cater to the tide of anger of the times, war films are certainly needed to be produced in large quantities.

Paramount is currently considering filming a blockbuster, titled "Mystery Ship," preparing to put the historical facts of the naval battle in the North Sea and the sinking of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee in the territorial waters near Uruguay after the battle with the three British cruisers on the silver screen, introducing them to the audience.

The authorities at Universal also have a story about European countries that has been compiled, the content of which describes the before and after of the recent war in Finland; this story has been named "Sea Patrol." Soon, personnel will be assigned to various departments.

MGM also has two films that are currently under construction, one titled "Escape" and the other "MortolStorm." The content is entirely a description of the situation of the Nazi Party in Germany and the detailed information on the back of the current European War.

In addition to what I want to report here, there is another major development in Hollywood recently; they are preparing to make their productions able to take on the responsibility of reporting to people all over the world every day, following the daily newspapers. According to this situation, there will eventually be a day when the news industry is led by the film industry.

### The First Performance of the Youth Society

— Yu

Youth is active. Studying on an isolated island is suffocating. Extracurricular activities should be combined with studying. The performance of the Youth Drama Research Society is to increase the interest of youth in extracurricular activities. Their first performance, which was also the day of their establishment, was at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. The names of the plays performed were modern and aimed at the current society; the first was "Uncle Liu San," which described an old gentleman in the countryside who, for the sake of his son, was lured by profit and sold out a friend. As a result, the father sacrificed a dirty son to maintain their family's history of integrity. The second play was "Lesson." A woman who left her hometown and taught a group of lovely elementary school students quietly went to the rear of the motherland, breaking away from stubborn family beliefs and inferior environments. In her last hasty words, there were these two lines: "I have donated my thousand-dollar dowry to the country, to avoid consuming shame..." These two profound sentences are not only a stimulus to the characters in the play, but also a warning to those who are currently in a dangerous situation. The heroine's fluent dialogue added a lot of vitality to the whole play.

The third play was the longest and most touching. The name of the play was "The Persecuted." A strong man who would rather starve than work for bad people, a girl struggling in a circle of lust, an old man sick in bed, a woman tempted by profit - combined to form a tragedy. In the end, the old man couldn't bear to see them! A pair of lovers under the evil forces committed a crime due to hunger. The girl was weak-willed and couldn't fight to the end, so she committed suicide. The strong man, waiting to kill the evil people and go to the light with his lover, could only bear a great hope in vain and hurriedly went to the interior alone. "The Persecuted" ended like this, and the three one-act plays also closed.

Although their sets and lighting were not grand enough, their performance can be said to be a success. It was not excessive, just right, and really encouraged young people to have a good impression of spoken drama.

Finally: I myself am also a depressed youth. I use the feelings and interests of a youth to introduce it to youths who regret having no extracurricular activities; I probably won't disappoint them! (Moved to help those in need)

### A History of Chinese Opera

— Hai Xing

There is hope for the publication this year of "A History of Chinese Opera" written by Zhou Yibai, with more than 600,000 words. It has critical descriptions from the Yuan Dynasty to the present and can be called an unprecedented masterpiece in the Chinese drama scene. A major bookstore had requested its publication before the war. After the "August 13th" incident, the bookstore gave up because of the sharp increase in costs and the obstruction of transportation in various places, making sales uncertain. In recent years, Zhou has revised it several times and added a lot of new information. It is now heard that it will be published by the Commercial Press under the recommendation of Zhou Yueran, and will be released in three installments. The first installment may be released this year.

### A Formal Announcement to Broadcasting Stations

— Rui

Radio broadcasting stations have a considerable history and status in Shanghai. Before the war, there were more than 20 broadcasting stations in Shanghai. However, at that time, because they were under the strict supervision and control of the Ministry of Communications, each broadcasting station paid very close attention to its own frequency, and broadcasting stations with less sophisticated equipment were not allowed to operate by the Ministry of Communications.

However, since the outbreak of the war, the government has moved from Nanjing to Chongqing, and Shanghai has therefore become a special place. Due to the increase in population and the abnormal development of various industries, broadcasting stations have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. However, because the environment is special and not subject to the control of the Ministry of Communications, they don't pay much attention to the frequency of the broadcasting stations. The neighboring broadcasting stations often interfere with each other, and even the better radios cannot separate them clearly. Even if there are good broadcasting programs, the audience feels disgusted. In this way, broadcasting stations that aim to make a profit will reduce their broadcasting effectiveness due to the reduction in the audience.

Secondly, what the audience regrets is that the announcers report advertisements incessantly or repeatedly. Although the broadcasting station aims to make a profit, advertising is of course the main business. However, if the record is only played for three minutes, and the announcer's commercial advertisement continues for five minutes or even ten minutes, this not only fails to increase the effectiveness of the advertisement, but instead makes the audience feel disgusted and unwilling to continue listening, causing the effectiveness of the advertisement to be reduced accordingly. Therefore, the reporting of advertisements must be concise and the amount must not be excessive. It is hoped that the broadcasting stations will pay attention.

Brief News: (1) The China Drama Society's "Han Gaozu" has been announced for a long time, but the author, Fei Tai, has revised the original manuscript several times out of seriousness, and has only now completed all five acts. At the same time, director Fei Mu has just finished filming "Confucius." After the editing is completed, he will immediately begin work on "Han Gaozu," so the rumor that Fei Mu will direct "Wen Tianxiang" is completely inaccurate. (2) Rong Shutang and Xu Zhentai, members of the Friendship National Opera Troupe in this city, have received careful guidance from the famous teacher Zhu Dingyuan, and their skills have improved rapidly. The troupe will hold its first rehearsal of the year at the Ningbo Fellow Association on the 9th of this month. Rong and Xu will also star in "Zhujia Village," and group leader Xu Tongsun will play in the Imperial Orchard. This performance will be very satisfactory. (3) Zhou Zenzuo, a wealthy paint merchant in Shanghai, held an engagement ceremony with Miss Qiu Zhijie at the Grand Ballroom of the Xianle Dance Palace on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday. The famous band Luo Ping led the entire orchestra to accompany the ceremony, which was extremely grand. The Xianle has a beautiful layout and low fees, and is equipped with hot and cold air conditioning. All sectors can rent it.
