### Whatever Happens, the British Government is Determined to Defend Hong Kong; The British King Appoints Major General Nording as Governor of Hong Kong; Plans to Evacuate British Nationals from Japan are Under Consideration

London: The British government began considering plans last night to evacuate British nationals in Japan. However, official circles stated that there are no immediate plans to evacuate British nationals in Japan. These plans are in the drafting stage. It is reported that Britain is preparing to instruct Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, to respond to Japan's demand to cut off the route for transporting war materials and supplies to the Dong Qing government from Burma. It is believed that Britain will consult with Australia before sending a reply to Japan. At the same time, Britain will exchange views with Washington and Moscow, as Japan's demand is of great importance to American and Soviet goods. Foreign commentators here doubt that Japan will be satisfied with the planned transfer of British troops stationed in Shanghai to Hong Kong. British authorities stated last night that Britain is determined to defend Hong Kong in any event. (United Press, 3rd)

London: Official circles announced that the current Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, is not currently in Hong Kong. The British King has appointed Major General Nording as Governor of Hong Kong. Major General Nording is currently serving as commander of a district in western India and will soon come to Hong Kong to take office. (Reuters, 3rd)

Hong Kong: Hong Kong learned today that it will be governed by a military governor, the first time for the colony since 1912. The renowned explorer and current Governor of the Madras region, Major General Nording, has been appointed as the acting Governor of Hong Kong. Sir Geoffrey Northcote, the Governor of Hong Kong, went on leave on May 19 to recuperate in Ceylon. During Governor Northcote's leave, Major General Nording will act as governor. Plans to evacuate other European and American women and children from Hong Kong are continuing today. (United Press, 3rd)

San Francisco: Former U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, arrived here en route to his new post as Minister to Australia yesterday. He stated that Britain may defend Hong Kong against any Japanese aggression. Gauss also stated that the Hong Kong government should evacuate non-combatants, which is taking a firm stance to deal with the Japanese threat. Gauss predicted that the small garrison in Hong Kong, combined with the British fleet stationed in China, would be sufficient to resist the invasion of Hong Kong. Gauss declined to comment on the possibility of the U.S. fleet being transferred to the East. (United Press, 3rd)

Manila: The American ship President Coolidge arrived here this morning from Hong Kong with one hundred American refugees. At the same time, the Japanese ship Empress of Japan also arrived with one thousand six hundred and forty British women and children. The wharves where the two ships docked were under special police protection. During the landing, teams from the U.S. Army and the Philippine Red Cross were dispatched to supervise. All the refugees have now been sent to the McKinley and Sternberg concentration camps in Baguio, where they will be provided for by the U.S. Army and the Philippine Red Cross. (United Press, 3rd)

Manila: 1,740 evacuees from Hong Kong arrived here at dawn today. The Empress of Japan carried 1,640 British citizens, and the President Coolidge carried 100 Americans. Due to quarantine regulations, they were temporarily detained outside the breakwater. They only docked at the wharf at about 11:30 a.m. After disembarking, the evacuees were taken in order by prepared vehicles to their designated destinations, some to Baguio, some to the U.S. military barracks at Fort McKinley, and some to the Philippine military barracks in Calamba, 80 miles from Manila. As a result of the sudden increase in population in Manila, there is a housing problem. All available empty houses are already full. The influx of these evacuees will increase the existing European population of Manila by 130%. Philippine President Quezon has issued a strong warning against profiteering, saying that this action cannot be tolerated. (Reuters, 3rd)

Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government is currently planning measures to search for those who are evading evacuation from here. It is now known that only 2,000 women registered yesterday to be evacuated. This number is far below the authorities' expectations. According to a government spokesperson, it is now evident that some people are attempting to hide and avoid evacuation. The government now feels that the successful completion of the evacuation is of utmost importance, especially for children, who should be made to leave Hong Kong. Therefore, measures are now being planned to search for those who have not registered and to order them all to leave Hong Kong. (United Press, 3rd)

Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government has announced that the compulsory evacuation of non-Chinese women and children will soon be implemented. Those who disobey the order will be punished without leniency. The U.S. Consul General here said that he has not yet received notification of this order, but stated that he expects that American women and children here will be subject to this order in the same way as other foreigners. He also stated that because subsequent evacuations will be difficult to obtain comfort during the journey, Americans have not responded enthusiastically to the government's evacuation warning. Currently, only 120 Americans have left Hong Kong. The U.S. Consul General also stated that he has received notification from the U.S. high officials in Manila that the Philippine inter-island ship Basilan, currently docked in Hong Kong, will be used on July 5th and 6th to transport Americans to the Philippines. The owner of the Basilan has especially provided the ship for the needs of evacuating Americans. The ship can accommodate 54 first-class passengers and 2,300 steerage passengers. The U.S. Consul General also stated that Philippine customs has especially allowed the passengers' luggage to enter the country. The U.S. Consulate General here will still be open for business tomorrow, but the American community here will not hold the July 4th U.S. Independence Day celebration and will donate HK$2,250 to the British war effort. (United Press, 3rd)

Reply to Japan Under Consideration

London: Undersecretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons that the reply to Japan's request that Britain stop the transportation of weapons, ammunition, and certain other supplies through Burma and Hong Kong is currently under consideration. A member of parliament then raised a supplementary question, asking whether the government had considered that if Britain complied with Japan's request to stop the supply of goods to China via the Burma route, it would create a very bad impression in the United States. Butler replied that this consideration was in our minds. (Reuters, 3rd)

British-Japanese Negotiations on Food Supply

Hong Kong: According to the Japanese Consul General here, negotiations between Britain and Japan regarding guaranteeing an adequate food supply to Hong Kong have begun in Guangzhou. British Consul Blundell is currently negotiating with the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou. Japan may allow food from the mainland to be transported to Hong Kong. The Japanese Consul General stated that Japan is not blockading Hong Kong, but only preventing traffic between Hong Kong and the mainland, so there is no so-called naval blockade of Hong Kong. Eight American women, as well as French, Czech, and Russian refugees, will leave Hong Kong for Shanghai on a Japanese ship on Friday. As for the Japanese nationals in Hong Kong, none have been evacuated. A British military spokesperson stated that the British military authorities in Hong Kong were not aware of the news of the transfer of British troops stationed in Shanghai to Hong Kong. According to statistics, 2,129 foreign women and children registered with the authorities yesterday for evacuation, which was less than expected. This small number of registrations shows that most families hope that the authorities will exempt them from evacuation and allow them to remain in Hong Kong by registering for war service. Many wives of political and business figures have left Hong Kong for Guangzhou today. A Hong Kong government spokesperson stated that people who can afford their own travel expenses are allowed to move to any place and do not necessarily have to go to Manila, but those who go to Guangzhou cannot sneak back into Hong Kong at will. (United Press, 3rd)

Japanese Spokesperson Answers Reporters' Questions

Tokyo: Today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told foreign journalists that the overall situation in Burma will become clear after Japan receives a reply from Britain regarding Japan's request to stop military supplies from being transported to Chongqing via Burma. The spokesperson also stated in response to a question that the Burma issue and the Hong Kong incident are not directly related. A reporter asked whether it was necessary for Britain to consult with the United States before replying to Japan. The spokesperson replied that this should be decided by Britain itself, but as far as Japan is concerned, such consultation would only delay Britain's reply. Another reporter raised a question about the British-American secret naval agreement reported by the Kokumin Shimbun. The spokesperson replied that there was no official confirmation of this news, but recalled that during the 1938 Round Table Conference, there was a rumor of a gentleman's agreement between the British and American navies, stipulating mutual cooperation. According to reliable sources received on Tuesday, the Kokumin Shimbun reported that Britain and the United States have now signed a secret naval agreement with special relevance to the Pacific.

### Japanese Troops Reinforcing Kaifeng Have Been Blocked by Chinese Forces; Remaining Japanese Troops in the South Gate Station Are Being Cleared

Chongqing: After the Japanese and puppet Chinese troops entered Kaifeng, more than a thousand Japanese reinforcements attempted to enter the city again, but were blocked by Chinese forces. Chinese forces also destroyed a Japanese armored train. (United Press, 3rd)

Zhengzhou: Since the 30th, Chinese troops in eastern Henan have been cooperating with units that have defected from the enemy to eliminate the Japanese, successively capturing places such as Luyi and Mamuji. With the force of a sweeping storm, they have advanced towards Dongtai and Bo County, reaping many gains. As of the morning of the 1st, all these areas were completely under Chinese control, and the Chinese are currently continuing to expand their victories. (3rd)

Luoyang: On the 30th, Chinese troops in eastern Henan captured Luyi. With irresistible force, they pursued the retreating enemy, killing countless Japanese along the way. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to Bo County. The Chinese besieged the county seat on the afternoon of the 30th, engaging in fierce fighting until the evening, and stormed into the town. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The grain depots and military supply warehouses in the town were all burned down by the Chinese forces, with flames lighting up the sky and not extinguishing all night. As of the morning of the 1st, the Chinese and Japanese were still fighting in the streets. On the same day, the Japanese in Zhuxian were attacked fiercely by Chinese forces and retreated, and the Chinese then recovered Zhuxian. (2nd)

Luoyang: The remaining Japanese troops trapped at the southeast foot of Kaifeng are still being fiercely attacked by the Chinese. On the morning of the 30th, more than a thousand Japanese troops from Xinxiang, riding in more than forty cars and under the cover of armored vehicles, drove south along the Bianxin Road to reinforce. When they reached Caiyuan Station, they were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese. After fierce fighting until 12 p.m., one Japanese armored vehicle and more than ten cars were destroyed. Japanese corpses piled up like mountains. The Chinese are currently intensifying their efforts to annihilate them. At the same time, the remaining Japanese troops who were stubbornly defending the South Gate were also completely annihilated by the Chinese, who are now sweeping through South Gate Street. (2nd)

Editorial

### The Spirit of American Independence and the Current International Situation

Today is American Independence Day, the day the thirteen North American colonies issued the Declaration of Independence. At that time, the people of those thirteen colonies, in order to resist illegal oppression and exploitation, did not hesitate to begin a revolutionary war to fight for freedom and independence in extreme hardship and poverty. Thanks to the heroic determination of Washington and other revolutionary leaders, and the vigorous and effective use of diplomacy, they finally laid a foundation for victory after five years of hard fighting, and established the first democratic republic in the midst of hardship, opening a new page in modern history. This magnificent drama, though now a full 165 years ago, is still an unparalleled model for resisting aggression and building a nation, not diminished in the slightest by the passage of time. Moreover, the contribution of the American Revolution is not limited to the birth of the United States of America. In a global sense, it was no less than an alarm bell for human rights, a beacon of enlightenment, enabling people in both the old and new worlds to understand the incomparable value of freedom and independence, and therefore willing to pay the price of blood and flesh to transform their own destiny. The United States and its people, precisely because they have experienced such a arduous struggle, are better able to appreciate the meaning and preciousness of freedom and independence, and therefore all struggles undertaken to realize this principle receive full sympathy and encouragement from the United States. China has also benefited greatly from this. This is what people should pay tribute to the United States and its people on this American Independence Day.

Unfortunately, the evolution of this real world is not entirely consistent with the principle of progress. In the past ten years or so, the world has not moved towards brightness, but has become increasingly dark, almost reversing the entire world to the era before the American Revolution. Recently, all of Europe has fallen into the tragedy of war, and the acts of aggression in the Far East have intensified. In addition to causing devastation in China, they have spread to the equatorial zone, causing a storm in the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. In this vast universe, only the Western Hemisphere still maintains a clean land, but it cannot escape the invasion of the shadows of aggression. The fundamental beliefs that were universally established in the world by American independence have now been subjected to unprecedented destruction. In some places, violence and conquest dominate everything; in some places, enslavement and humiliation replace independence and freedom; and modern civilization and democratic politics have also encountered unprecedentedly serious trials. This is a rare change in modern history, and at the same time it has further increased the responsibility of the United States, which has excellent political traditions and great national potential.

In the international changes of the past decade, the United States has made indelible contributions, such as establishing the principle of non-recognition of territorial changes by force, criticizing and condemning acts of aggression, and various appeals and measures regarding events in Asia and Europe. These are commendable and wise actions, but unfortunately, their actual effect is negligible. Moreover, as of today, the situation has become increasingly difficult and complex. On the one hand, even the US authorities have admitted that words and protests alone are not effective. On the other hand, the crisis comes from both Europe and Asia, and the urgency and importance of the two are also difficult to assess. If one cannot see the big picture from the small, and make decisive decisions, then one may not miss the opportunity and repeat the repeated failures of the past decade. The reason why aggressors dare to be reckless and start wildfires may also be because they see the weaknesses of the United States' complex internal political views, the upcoming elections, and so on, so they are eager to strike first in order to achieve their goals. Recently, the US fleet has returned to the Pacific, which is a sedative for the Far East crisis, but it is clearly insufficient to eliminate the crisis. The US government and people are still striving to avoid the spread of war, and there is still considerable distance between empty protests and war, and there are still some effective measures that can be used, such as the most wise measure in the Far East being to intensify cooperation with China and use its economic power. This should not be hesitated from either a moral or self-interest point of view. As for whether the Atlantic or Pacific crisis is more important, it is difficult to draw a conclusion quickly, but the situation in Europe is complex, while the Far East is far simpler. Germany and Italy in Europe are gaining momentum, while the aggressors in the Far East are already on the verge of decline and exhaustion. The future development of the European situation is still uncertain, while the threat in the Far East is getting closer and closer, and can no longer be condoned. If one hesitates and looks around, so that in the future one has to deal with attacks from both sides at the same time, why not start with the more urgent and easier aspects first, and quickly bring peace to the Pacific storm?

The United States is not lacking in enlightened people, and at such a critical moment, it should no longer be concerned about maintaining personal political views and monetary profits. One hundred and sixty-five years ago, the United States set an example for the world by starting the democratic political revolution, and today in the 20th century, the United States should be the most powerful fortress for upholding freedom and independence. Unless the United States immediately uses its strong potential to take active measures to eliminate this worldwide tragedy and evil, the political beliefs that spread around the world as a result of American independence will inevitably become more and more decadent, and even whether the New World can maintain this in the long run will become a question. While celebrating the anniversary of American independence, I respectfully submit this idea to the American government and people.

### Song Ziwen Re-visits U.S. President to Discuss the Overall Situation in the Far East; Urging the U.S. to Take Effective Action to Restrain Japan; New U.S. Loans to China Under Consideration

Washington: Mr. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China and former Minister of Finance of the Nationalist Government, held his second meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday. During lunch, Mr. Song continued to talk with the President. Lunch was sent to the President's desk by attendants on trays. According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt wanted to inquire in detail about the situation in the Far East, including the recent developments in China, French Indochina, and Japan. Diplomatic circles believe that Mr. Song will ask the President to take new actions to help China resist Japan, especially regarding the US fleet's move to the Atlantic. Well-informed sources said that Mr. Song is negotiating new credit loans with the US government, and the US government is giving Mr. Song's request serious consideration. Before his second meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday, Mr. Song visited Secretary of State Hull and met with Mr. Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Subsequently, Hull and Jones held talks. Mr. Song declined to tell reporters about his visits to the President, Secretary of State Hull, and Mr. Jones, Chairman of the Export-Import Bank. The President told reporters that Mr. Song's visit was "of a social nature." The President referred to Mr. Song as his "old friend." The President said that their talks included various world events, but he did not elaborate. Mr. Song also met with Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday. Mr. Song said that the visit was not of great significance, while Welles said that it was just "reminiscing about friendship." It is reported that Hull hosted a banquet for Mr. Song last Friday. Mr. Song met with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Export-Import Bank President Bearson. Mr. Song also met with British Ambassador to the United States Lothian yesterday. Well-informed sources said that Mr. Song will soon return to New York, but will come to Washington again before returning to China. (United Press, 3rd)

### Roosevelt Issues Decree Banning Export of Military Supplies; Copper and Scrap Iron Will Be Banned; Heavy Blow to Japan's Urgent Needs

Washington: President Roosevelt signed a decree today banning the export of various important military materials, including aluminum, antimony, asbestos, chromium, manganese, magnesium, mercury, spectacle lenses, quinine, rubber, silk, tin, wool, various chemicals, aircraft parts, iron plates, bulletproof glass, and machine tools. (Haitong, 3rd)

Washington: Yesterday, President Roosevelt signed the "May Act," after which the President has the power to ban the export of all military supplies. After signing the bill, Roosevelt immediately announced that 46 specific goods would require special permits for export starting next Thursday. It is said that the raw materials and products division of the Defense Advisory Commission is currently determining the items to be controlled and setting limits to ensure that the goods are adequately stored for domestic defense purposes. Although officials say that a complete embargo is not currently being considered, rubber, tin, silk, aluminum, and other metals, as well as machinery, will certainly be subject to control. Moreover, according to the bill he signed, President Roosevelt has the power to ban the export of all raw materials and supplies necessary for the manufacture of weapons, so it is conceivable that the President may soon ban copper, scrap iron, and oil. These three items are in great demand by other powerful countries, especially Japan. (International News Service, 3rd)

### Singapore Strengthens Alert, Prohibits Nighttime Navigation

Singapore: The official gazette here announced yesterday that to strengthen the alert here, local ships are not allowed to sail in Singapore waters from sunset to sunrise. Large ships are not allowed to sail at night. People are not allowed to land at any port except for specific locations. The Singapore authorities also denied the evacuation of military families here. (United Press, 3rd)

### Rumors of a Secret Naval Agreement Between Britain and the U.S. to Jointly Defend Pacific Interests Arouse Serious Concerns from the Japanese Authorities

Tokyo: The "Kokumin Shimbun" claimed that the sudden evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong proves that Britain is not prepared to answer Japan's demands in a completely satisfactory manner. According to a telegram received yesterday, Britain's tough attitude is backed by the assistance of the United States, and a large-scale secret British-American naval agreement in the Pacific is about to be concluded. It is reported that Senator Pittman has approved it. The terms of the naval agreement are as follows: (1) If new international problems arise in the Pacific, Britain and the United States mutually recognize that they have common interests. (2) In this regard, Britain and the United States will dispatch their fleets for the purpose of joint defense. (3) In view of the seriousness of Hong Kong's political and military significance and the current situation, Hong Kong will be placed under the actual management of the United States. (4) Hong Kong, Singapore, Darwin, Honolulu, and Dutch ports will become joint British-American naval bases. The newspaper added that this agreement aims to encircle Japan and has aroused serious concerns from official and non-official circles in Tokyo. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Stimson and Knox Advocate for US Rearmament to Face Two-Ocean Crisis; Stimson Confirmed as Secretary of War by Senate Military Committee

Washington - Colonel Stimson, nominated by President Roosevelt for Secretary of War, read a prepared statement to the Senate Military Committee reviewing his qualifications, stating roughly that if we sit and wait for the enemy to come, he does not believe we can avoid being invaded. The danger the United States faces is unprecedented. The duration of the current period of US military buildup largely depends on the continued British control of the North Atlantic. In this situation, any assistance the United States can provide to maintain British naval power in the North Atlantic is a critical step in US rearmament. The current situation is more precarious than last fall (when the arms embargo was lifted), and the time during which British naval power can be preserved is even more precious. No one wants to send American soldiers beyond our borders unless it is absolutely necessary to protect the United States itself. He does not believe that the United States can achieve security with purely passive or defensive national defense. The American defense line includes Puerto Rico, Bermuda, Newfoundland, and northeastern Canada. Everyone now recognizes that if a strong enemy gains a base in any of these places, they can launch aerial attacks on the US East Coast. All of these places except Puerto Rico are currently in the theater of war, so this line is already severely affected. He advocated for the immediate passage of legislation to establish a selective compulsory military training and service system. The passage of this bill would immediately make the entire nation aware of the serious nature of the events facing the United States and the need for each individual to contribute to addressing the crisis. In response to a question, Stimson said sending troops to Europe was impossible. A senator asked, "Do you think the United States should send troops to Europe?" Stimson replied, "I do not think so today. I do not believe we can land troops in Europe." The Senate Military Committee passed Stimson's appointment as Secretary of War by a vote of 14 to 3. (Reuters, 3rd)

During yesterday's Senate Naval Affairs Committee hearing on Knox's nomination as Secretary of the Navy, Senator Bone, a Democrat from Washington, publicly asked Knox to explain an editorial recently published in the Chicago Daily News under his management. The editorial stated that the United States should not allow Japan to seize the Dutch East Indies. Knox told Senator Bone that the United States should take all measures to prevent Japan from seizing the Dutch East Indies. He said, "Once we adopt a tough policy, we should not back down." At this point, Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, replied that senior officials of the US Navy had told him that the United States could not single-handedly prevent Japanese aggression in the South Pacific. Senator Holt, a Democrat from Virginia, then asked Colonel Knox for his opinion on the situation in the Far East. Knox said he advocated a "tough policy" in the Far East, but he could not take immediate action. He said, "I do not want to make unrealistic empty talk about the Far East at this time, because it is not appropriate to provoke a war on both oceans at the same time. If Britain falls, we may face a crisis in the Atlantic." Senator Walsh then interrupted Knox's remarks and asked him if he would change his attitude if he received notification that the US Navy could not operate alone in the Far East. Knox hesitated and replied that if this happened, the situation would be "greatly different." Walsh then said, "In that case, our conclusion would be that without the cooperation of Britain and France, we cannot operate alone in the Far East." Knox replied, "If so, then we should not make threats to others." Knox publicly stated to the Naval Committee that in national defense, especially when the US fleet is already in the Pacific, he advocated that the United States allow British and French warships to use its ports, "whether neutral or non-neutral." Later, the Senate Naval Committee held Knox's nomination in abeyance because Washington female reporter Ashley had published Knox's words in the newspaper, saying that he advocated sending an expeditionary force to Europe. The committee will hear testimony from Ms. Ashley today. Knox said that the statement did not represent his opinion because it was inaccurate and a misunderstanding.

Although Colonel Stimson had previously made numerous strong statements on Far Eastern policy, he now does not want to express other opinions on the Far East except for very general talk. Yesterday, he did not mention Far Eastern policy in the Military Committee. When faced with old challenges, Stimson refused to express an opinion on the philosophy of "Europe for Europeans, Asia for Asians." He said that he could not criticize without understanding the true situation. He also said that the reason he advocated that the British fleet must maintain its strength was so that the US fleet could maintain a strong presence in the Pacific. Colonel Stimson condemned the aggressor nations and said that the world is currently facing a threat from a group of countries whose foreign policy is systematically aggressive towards peace-loving neighbors.

### US Closely Watching Situation in the Philippines

Washington - Washington sources say that Tokyo's announcement that Foreign Minister Nomura will visit the Philippines soon will increase general anxiety in the Far East and make rumors that Japan will take military action outside the Asian continent more credible. Political and business circles in the United States are closely watching the situation in the Philippines. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Foreign military sources said that war materials are currently being transported from Germany to Romania, most of which are anti-aircraft guns, to complete the fortifications on the mountain peaks around the industrial center of Brasov in Transylvania province. It is said that before the Soviet Union delivered its final ultimatum to Romania, two hundred German planes arrived in Romania, so there were rumors that Romania was preparing to resist Soviet invasion. Romanian military circles said that the arrival of German arms in their country was not surprising. They said that Germany was merely fulfilling its contract with Romania. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Red Army Inspects Romanian Armories

Moscow - According to a reporter from Izvestia in Chainoveti, the city has begun a new life. Trams, telephones, post offices, and factories have all returned to normal operation. Workers have become the masters of the factories. Some residents have reported the locations of Romanian military camps and storage depots to the Red Army headquarters, and have also handed over the weapons and ammunition left behind by the Romanian army to the Red Army headquarters. According to the inspection results, these weapons and ammunition are all old-fashioned weapons made in foreign countries (especially England and France). According to Romanian soldiers, the morale of the Romanian troops was extremely poor. Russians and Ukrainians who refused to leave Bessarabia were shot. Romanian soldiers deserting and disobeying orders were common everywhere. The people of Chainovizhi are currently celebrating together, holding mass rallies and shouting slogans such as "Long live the Soviet government," "Thank you, great Stalin," and "Long live the Red Army." The city is now flying the Soviet flag. (TASS, 2nd)

### Romanian Foreign Minister Reports on Negotiations with the Soviet Union; Result of Painful Cession; Decision to Abandon Anglo-French Guarantees

Bucharest - Romanian Foreign Minister Argetoianu delivered a speech yesterday at a joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses, declaring: "On the night of the 26th of last month, the government received a report from the ambassador to Russia that the Soviet Russian government had made demands (the telegram had already been published). So, the next morning, a royal council was convened. In addition to the royal privy councilors and all cabinet members, the Chief of Staff also participated in the discussion. After detailed discussion, it was believed that without foreign aid, Romania would be difficult to resist for a long time. Therefore, we could not refuse the Soviet Russian side's 'bitter pill.' So, we replied to Moscow, asking them to postpone the deadline (the original telegram had also been published). At 9:00 pm on June 27th, expecting that the Soviet Russian reply would be received soon, the royal council was convened again. That night, we received the Soviet Russian reply, demanding the cession of territory within four days, and guaranteeing that all railways, factories, bridges, warehouses, airfields, industrial buildings, telephone power plants, etc. on the territory would be handed over to Soviet Russia in perfect condition. All outstanding issues would be resolved by a mixed committee. The reply was required by 12:00 noon, Soviet Russian time, on the 28th. The situation at that time was very clear. We only had two options: surrender or war. Since war was not guaranteed, we had to painfully accept the conditions. The result of this incident forced Romania to change its foreign policy, and therefore decided to announce the cancellation of the Anglo-French guarantees of April 13, 1939. Our great mountains and rivers are now being painfully ceded. The inner pain of the Romanian people is self-evident. We can only work, only unite, to cope with this difficult situation and to break this bad environment. We should shout, with loyal hearts and tragic tones, 'Long live indestructible Romania, long live the King!'" (Haitong Telegraph, 3rd)

### Gandhi Encourages Britain to Strive Hard; Opposes Use of Violence; Making Dishonorable Competition

New Delhi - Gandhi published an article asking British people everywhere to adopt non-violent methods to replace methods of war in order to adjust international relations. He said, "I do not want Britain to fail, nor do I want Britain to win in the barbaric trial of force. If Britain, for the sake of victory, must take the same destructive work as the Germans by extremely thorough means, then this method cannot eliminate Nazism, but only make a dishonorable competition. Britain should fight with non-violent weapons worthy of a brave warrior. Even if Hitler and Mussolini occupy your beautiful islands, your homes, and make you be slaughtered, do not obey them." Gandhi also said that he loved Britain and that his love would not diminish because of any development. In this article, Gandhi revealed that he had notified the Viceroy of India that if he believed his service could be of any practical use in promoting the purpose of this article, he would be willing to be driven by the British government.

### British Express Appreciation for Burma's Aid; Discussion of Autonomy After the End of the War

London - The British government expressed its deep gratitude for Burma's repeated unconditional aid to Britain during the war. It has invited a Burmese representative to be a senator and will begin discussing Burma's becoming an autonomous territory, especially after the end of the war. The Prime Minister of Burma recently wrote to the British Minister to Burma, Cochrane, expressing his willingness to do his best to help in the common work of making civil governance win, and asking Britain to immediately issue a declaration approving Burma's immediate autonomy after the war. In addition to expressing the British government's gratitude, Cochrane immediately invited a Burmese person to serve as a senator to assist him in handling certain administrative matters, and stated that the needs of the Burmese question after the war cannot be foreseen at this time, but the British government is willing to discuss it at that time.

### British Railway Workers' Union Launched Anti-Chamberlain Movement; Compromise Policy Misled the Country and Should Be Held Responsible; Resolution Passed Demanding Immediate Removal from Office

London - The British National Union of Railwaymen held its annual meeting last night and passed a resolution demanding that all cabinet members who supported former Prime Minister Chamberlain and Chamberlain's appeasement policy be dismissed. This resolution coincided with the anti-Chamberlain movement launched by most of the British press and military members and other opposition members in parliament. Barton, explaining the resolution, said, "What we fear most today is not the power of the German air force and German mechanized troops, but the fifth column elements in our country still occupying high positions in the government. I do not want to name these people, nor do I want to put them to torture. I only want to see these people in positions where they cannot do harm, so as not to mislead the country as did Marshal Petain of France." He also said that this resolution would be sent to British Prime Minister Churchill by the union's delegation, and the delegation would also ask the Prime Minister for a direct reply. The resolution read, "Although this is a request from some of us, it has to be so, because it is a matter of public trust and national animosity. Cabinet members and other personnel in high positions who agree with the previous government's appeasement policy should be removed from office immediately and their positions should be given to people trusted by the people." At the same time, the Scottish National Union of Miners, which was held in Glasgow, also passed a similar resolution by a vote of 61 to 45, advocating the dismissal of all officials who supported Chamberlain's policy. The Scottish Trades Union Congress will also hold a special meeting to discuss the war situation, and it is rumored that the past actions of current political leaders will also be studied. Under the current situation, there may be another anti-Chamberlain movement in the House of Commons, but the Prime Minister does not intend to give the House of Commons any formal report before next week. However, Chamberlain and his associates currently occupy most of the power in the House of Commons, and the cabinet may not be able to change these elements. (Associated Press, 3rd)

### Rumors in London That Britain and Germany Are Brewing Peace; Rumors That Germany Has Proposed Peace Suggestions, Including Four Basic Conditions

London - Most diplomats here believe that the recent lull in the Anglo-German war may be brewing peace. These diplomats have reported to their respective governments on the recent news that Britain has no intention of peace talks, and said that Germany may not be able to conquer Britain by means of aggression, and Britain is also difficult to attack Germany and the German-occupied territories in mainland Europe. They expect both Britain and Germany to suffer huge losses from air raids, but they do not believe that these air raids will determine the outcome of the war. An ambassador of a certain country told the Associated Press reporter that German envoys had recently made peace suggestions to many British people, but they were rejected by the British people. The contents of the peace suggestions included the following basic conditions: (1) Britain should recognize the new Greater Europe currently under German control, (2) Some British colonies should be ceded to Germany, (3) The colonies of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands should be changed to "European colonies" and ruled by Germany, (4) Germany and Britain should form an alliance. There is also a view on this type of German peace terms that the area Germany wants to form also includes some large areas of the European part of the Soviet Union. Regarding the third condition, some people are quite skeptical, saying that Germany would not merge the Dutch East Indies into the so-called "European colonies" to provoke Japan.

### German High Command Releases Detailed Account of Second Phase of War - Infantry and Mechanized Units Coordinate, a Masterpiece of the German High Command

Berlin: Yesterday, the Führer's headquarters released a detailed account of the German army's second offensive in France from June 5th until the signing of the armistice agreement. The details of this report are as follows:

While the battles in Flanders and Artois were not yet complete, the air force and several divisions within the army, which had not yet participated in the fighting, were prepared for a second offensive against France.

The prelude to the new war was a massive German air force attack on June 3rd on the airfields around Paris and the center of the aircraft manufacturing industry. It was decided that three army corps, commanded by Generaloberst von Rundstedt, Generaloberst von Bock, and Generaloberst von Leeb, would be ready to attack under the command of Generaloberst von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army. The goal of the German offensive was to break through the French northern lines and destroy the army by pushing it southwest and southeast. As the divisions under Generaloberst von Bock prepared to attack across the lower reaches of the Somme River and the Oise-Aisne Canal, it was discovered that the enemy was prepared to defend the area. The French commander decided to thoroughly defend the "Weygand Line" and the Maginot Line with all available troops. The French had devised a new defense method to stop the surprisingly rapid breakthrough of the German army's motorized units. After four days of fierce fighting, the infantry and armored divisions of General Kleeberg, General Richthofen, and General Strauss finally broke through the enemy lines. On June 9th, the German pursuit towards the lower reaches of the Seine River and Paris was in full swing. On the same day, General Hoth's rapid troops reached Roche and surrounded large numbers of enemy troops along the banks of the Cheppe and Saint-Souplet Rivers. As a result, the enemy's western flank was destroyed, and the western side of the line was stabilized. The German air force's group attacks were the main reason for the army's victory in the area. In the Seine River region, the German bomber offensive scattered the enemy infantry divisions and armored vehicles preparing to counterattack. The German air force also bombed railway lines and destroyed railway materials, preventing enemy reserves from being deployed to the front lines. When the enemy began to retreat at Le Havre, Cherbourg, and Brest, the air force immediately attacked the port facilities, fuel tanks, and ships in the above ports. Generaloberst von Rundstedt's corps' offensive towards Compiègne and the west bank of the Meuse River was the start of the general land offensive on June 9th. At the start of the major battle in the area, the infantry divisions led by General Weichs, General Licht, and General Busch broke through the Aisne defenses, allowing large motorized units to pass through smoothly. The land forces in the area received great assistance from the German air force. On June 11th, the armored car divisions and motorized infantry divisions of General Geyr von Schweppenburg and General von Kleist were prepared in the Châlons area to advance towards Troyes and destinations beyond Saint-Dizier. For the third time in twenty-five years, German troops crossed the Marne River. After several fierce battles, German motorized units broke through the enemy defenses in the southeast near the Swiss border. The ability of large numbers of infantry divisions and motorized units to coordinate with each other in a small area was truly a masterpiece of the German High Command. At this time, German forces had occupied the lower reaches of the Seine River and broken through the defenses protecting Paris. The enemy's western flank ceased resistance. On June 14th, General Guderian's troops entered Paris. The enemy forces on the northern line completely collapsed under the German pursuit. On the 14th, General Leeb's corps joined the fighting, launching a fierce offensive against the enemy's strongest fortresses. Two days later, with the assistance of a large number of artillery units, the troops of General Witzleben broke through the seemingly impregnable Maginot Line. As a result, the enemy's eastern, southern, and northern lines were threatened from the rear and split into two parts. The enemy's hope of resistance was declared extinguished. On the 15th, General Dollmann's troops occupied the upper reaches of the Rhine River near Colmar and broke through the Vosges Mountains. The close cooperation between the German air force and the army enabled the rapid completion of the encirclement of the Maginot Line south of Saarbrucken, Colmar, and Metz. The low-flying attacks of bombers and fighters were extremely effective. The anti-aircraft units assisted the advance of the infantry to great effect. At the same time, the air force assisted the infantry in advancing towards Besançon as far as the Swiss border. After June 15th, the pursuit from the coast to the Meuse River was on the largest scale. After the fall of Paris, the French army fled in disarray under the German general advance south and southwest and aerial bombardment. This frantic pursuit by land and air prevented the enemy from concentrating its forces on the opposite bank of the Loire River. The power of the German advance, even the Verdun fortress, a symbol of French resistance during the World War, could not withstand and finally fell on the 15th. On the 17th, German troops reached the Franco-Swiss border southwest of Besançon, thus encircling the French forces in Alsace-Lorraine and the Maginot Line. After crossing the Loire River, the enemy had no ability to resist. The French army had lost its fighting power and laid down its weapons. In this situation, French Premier Marshal Pétain asked the German government to present its armistice conditions. On June 21st, before the Führer and the German Commander-in-Chief, the humiliation of 1918 was completely erased in the original historical location of the forest of Compiègne. After the French delegation accepted the armistice conditions of the German Commander-in-Chief, it signed the document at 6:50 PM on the 22nd. At 1:35 AM on the 25th, the German and Italian armies ceased combat operations against France, bringing an end to six weeks of unprecedented fierce fighting. The German army achieved a great victory. The success of the second phase of the war was largely due to the achievements of the air force. The effective leadership of General Göring, the dedicated service of the air force generals, were all reasons for the victory. In terms of air defense, the proper command of General Glaubrecht and General Kreipe demonstrated a spirit of victory in every battle. The army, under the cover of the air force, spared no sacrifice in seizing positions, capturing enemy generals, and pursuing the fleeing enemy. After occupying the coasts of Holland, Belgium, and France, the navy had a new task, which was to convert the seaports into bases. The achievements of the German military buildup also shocked the world. People from all countries asked how the German army was able to achieve such remarkable feats in such a short period of time. It must be known that the reason for Germany's victory is what the enemy perceived as Germany's weakness. In other words, it is the revolution of the Third Reich and the leaders of National Socialism. These two have produced the best weapons of modern warfare, as well as the supreme commander, unified command of the army, navy, and air force, increased the efficiency of officers and soldiers, and created one of the most glorious pages in German history. From June 5th to 25th, General Specht, commander of the German corps, died for the country. A total of 16,822 officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force were killed, 9,921 were missing, and 68,511 were wounded. From the perspective of the state, Germany's victory over France resulted in very few casualties. However, for individuals, it is of course to be greatly regretted. The total number of German officers and soldiers from May 10th until the armistice agreement:

Compared to the World War, this can be considered negligible. In 1914, the German army lost 638,000 men on the Western Front, of whom 85,000 were killed. In the 1916 offensive at Verdun, it lost 310,000 men, of whom 41,000 were killed. In the Battle of the Somme, it lost 417,000 men, of whom 58,000 were killed. In the German offensive in France in April 1918, it lost 240,000 men (35,000 killed). How can the casualty statistics of this year's campaign, which brought France to its knees, be compared? It is impossible to know the extent of the losses on the French side, but 1,900,000 men were captured, including five corps commanders and approximately 29,000 officers. Its naval losses were also enormous (see another dispatch). Moreover, in addition to the heavy losses suffered by the enemy's army, navy, and air force, the armistice agreement has prevented the remaining French forces from participating in combat.

England is the Only Enemy

Berlin: The conclusion of the German High Command's latest report stated: Since the German army defeated the land power in the Western Front who claim to be brave in the war, the great victory of Germany has caused the Allied countries to lose their existence. Now, the only enemy of Germany is England. (3rd dispatch by Huitong)

German Casualty Statistics

Berlin: The German High Command released the number of casualties suffered by the German army from the start of the offensive on the Western Front on May 10th until the day the armistice agreement was signed: 27,074 killed, 18,384 missing, and 111,034 wounded, totaling 156,492 casualties.

French Casualties

Geneva: French newspapers revealed the losses suffered by the French army in the battles in Belgium and France, as announced by the French government: 60,000 killed, 300,000 wounded, and 600,000 captured. According to the French official gazette, the reason for the French army's defeat was entirely due to the mistakes in the general staff's strategy. It defended important positions, while the enemy adopted a strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, attacking several strongholds of our army. As a result, the army's line of defense was broken through. The evacuation of residents was also a mistake, greatly affecting the morale of the soldiers. (3rd dispatch by Huitong)

### German Power Within Romania

Sibiu is a stronghold of the Romanian New Party movement. The headquarters of the local leaders of the Romanian National Socialist Party and the German expatriate community are located there. All orders for the National Socialist Party district departments in Transylvania, Banat, Summer West, old Romania, and Bessarabia are issued from this place.

Although the city's residents include Germans, Romanians, and Hungarians, it is the Germans who control everything. Most of the shops are in German hands, and the Germans prevent people of other nationalities from setting up shops in prime locations within the city.

The economic lifeline of Sibiu is controlled by German banks, which have close ties with banks within Germany. These banks have young German merchants replacing non-Germanic positions. The streets are filled with uniformly dressed young people wearing Tyrolean-style hats and white socks, a fashion favored by Sudetenland National Socialists before the Munich Conference.

Most of what you hear on the streets is the German dialect. When people meet, they give the German salute. In bookstores, you see workers, and in the center of the bookstore is "Mein Kampf," priced at six U.S. dollars per copy.

Romanian students wear the uniforms of the Romanian Youth League, but German children wear their special hats, the color of which is very similar to that of Hitler's hat. If there are no Romanian soldiers on the street, one could easily feel as if they were in Germany.

At the same time, the Germans in Sibiu believe they are living in Germany. They rejoice every time they hear of a German victory and express joy every time a neutral country is invaded. The Germans of Sibiu consider themselves 100% German, and the National Socialist Party considers them the rulers of Transylvania. They all believe that the Germans in Romania will soon be under German government rule and are impatient for this to happen. They are willing to welcome Hitler in these places and immediately raise the German swastika flag, which they still dare not do openly. Countless swastika flags are being secretly manufactured in neighboring villages.

Sibiu is the center of so-called German reformation. These Germans were associated with Hitler before 1933, and after that year, they openly opposed the liberal Germans belonging to the mutual aid groups. Fabritius is the leader of the German expatriate community in Romanian Germany. He was a captain in the Austro-Hungarian army during the last Great War. After 1918, he became the owner of a poultry business and at the same time began political activities in Sibiu.

From this place, large numbers of young people go to Germany for training to become German propagandists, breaking the power of previous German leaders in Romania. The leaders of the former German minority in Romania, from Protestant bishops to cultural leaders, had to obey Fabritius' leadership. He also designated the candidates for the Romanian parliament. Currently, the German representatives, in the name of their leader, are loyal to the Romanian government. Fabritius has a very close relationship with the leaders in Berlin, and he has lived in Germany for several months.

Even when he is away, the National Socialist Party's headquarters does not stop its activities. Local leaders continue to travel to the districts they lead, and organizational work is clearly still underway. The German consul in Brașov visits Sibiu twice a week to hold lengthy talks with National Socialist leaders.

The main German newspaper in Romania is also published here. The entire editorial staff are trusted National Socialist Party members.

Other nationals in Sibiu are well aware that the National Socialist Party has placed them on a "blacklist." Although there is no open conflict, the relationship between the National Socialist Party and people of other nationalities is extremely tense. For example, in the Netherlands, people already feel the danger of the activities of the German Fifth Column. The only difference is that in Sibiu and its surroundings, the Germans are more numerous and better organized than in Rotterdam.

Outside of Sibiu, in Satu Mare and Medias, Romania, the Germans have recently tried to organize the minorities there. That place is only ten miles away from the Hungarian border. In addition to Romanians and Germans, there are many Hungarians. The National Socialist Party is trying hard to prove that these Hungarians are descendants of Germans.

Under the guidance of local leader Wessar, national conferences are held continuously to investigate the ancestry of the people. These meetings began in April and ended in early May.

In one village, despite the opposition of the church, the Germans held a meeting where twelve people went door-to-door to investigate the ancestry of each household. In the report of the local leader, it was pointed out that half of the residents no longer speak German. In his opinion, this is the fault of the pastors and teachers. In another town, the pastor did not use the school for meetings, and the local youth club and town hall were locked. In the end, they had to meet in a smaller convent.

From the detailed reports of the local leaders of the National Socialist Party, it is clear that the National Socialist Party members in Romania are actively active in the Northwest District. Although the Hungarians are very opposed to them, they have achieved some success. The local administrative authorities are extremely surprised that the Romanian government allows their activities, because the Romanian government has special orders that only the Romanian United Front is allowed to have political gatherings, and this area is also the most important national defense area, so it is difficult to allow the National Socialist Party to operate.

### European Radio Broadcasting War

Every day, Britain and Germany engage in an aerial propaganda war, using dozens of radio stations broadcasting in dozens of languages. Their effects, though sometimes good and sometimes bad, mostly involve a bit of slyness and troublemaking. The Germans use fifty radio stations to constantly attack Britain, never saying a good word. They either say that Eden "only cares about clothes and can't talk," or mock the Minister of Economic Warfare, Cross, as "Minister of Famine."

Berlin broadcaster Fritzsche's masterpiece is in publicizing British naval losses. Sometimes the Germans attack the British heavily on the airwaves, but they don't really know what they mean. This only angers the British. For example, a German radio station was broadcasting an American song very well, and the audience was enjoying it when, suddenly, the broadcaster's voice inserted, saying: "Today our topic is Germany's enemy, the root of Britain's woes -- Churchill!" Then he greatly mocked Churchill.

The Berlin broadcasters come from various nationalities and broadcast "news" to the world in various languages. An Egyptian named Fakhousa was captured by the Germans at the beginning of the war. The German army told him that he could broadcast propaganda in Arabic or be confined to a prisoner-of-war camp. He naturally wanted to take on the broadcasting job. Known as the "Noble Indian," when he officially broadcasts about Britain's cruel colonial policies, one can often detect a rare Prussian accent. An unnamed "American doctor," who, it is claimed, "just came from Poland," describes the prosperity there on the radio. Captured British soldiers and airmen—some real, some fake—often promote to their hometowns on the airwaves that German prisoner-of-war camps are better than high-end hotels. An American broadcaster discovered that these so-called German "prisoners" often appeared near the radio station.

The most outstanding character in the radio broadcasting war has to be Lord Haw-Haw, who promotes Germany. The British enjoy listening to this aristocratic broadcaster with his calm tone and pleasant elocution more than any foreign program. The London broadcasting community imitated this "Haw-Haw," which was once all the rage. At first, the authorities did not pay attention, but now, apart from broadcasting a set of "How to listen to German propaganda," they are at a loss. In addition to broadcasting so-called "news," Haw-Haw often mocks the British government. Regarding (1) food distribution, he said to the British, "This fully represents your penny-pinching government. Therefore, your meat allocation is based on price -- a limit of one shilling and ten pence a week, unlike Germany, which distributes based on quantity." (2) On evacuating the population, he said, "What right does your government have to separate you from your husband? After you leave the city safely, do you know what your husband is doing now?" He also said to the workers: "British workers, you don't need to worry. The German leader knows very well that it is the British gentlemen who started this war, and they are using you as cannon fodder." Ordinary workers feel very indignant when they hear this kind of propaganda and wanted to fight Hitler before Chamberlain.

Lord Haw-Haw is actually a pseudonym for William Joyce, who was originally a subordinate of the British political leader Mosley. After leaving, he founded the Nazi Fascist Party himself. He then ran off to Germany because of economic problems. Now he is the highest-paid "foreign" broadcaster in Germany, earning as much as (U.S. dollars) sixty dollars a week. German radio plays often broadcast the peaceful atmosphere under Hitler's rule from the airwaves. From the radio, you can hear a butcher in Hamburg talking to his customers, saying that all kinds of meat are fully stocked, and there is nothing you can't buy if you can name it. The Germans do not seem to find this contradictory. An hour later, there seem to be the cries of babies and the weeping of women, proving that the British blockade is inhumane.

Not long ago, Lord Haw-Haw staged another radio drama called "Lloyd's of London." Lloyd's famous "Lutine Bell" rings from time to time, indicating a warning to insurers that ships are sinking one after another. The British can only laugh at this kind of practice. Originally, this "Lutine Bell" does not necessarily ring when a ship sinks. It is only used when special news occurs, such as when there is no news of a ship arriving for a long time, and then its whereabouts are known, so the bell is rung to notify everyone.

### Ministry of Education Revises New Methods to Improve National People's Education Centers

(Chongqing Airmail News) The People's Education Center is the central location for the implementation of social education. It is responsible for the implementation of mass education, the improvement of cultural standards, assistance in mass organization and training, the promotion of local autonomy, the guidance of recreational activities, the promotion of mass livelihood and side businesses, the propaganda of party doctrine and government decrees, and the organization of other social education work. Since the Anti-Japanese War, all localities have deeply felt the importance of social education, but there are still many who have not been able to do their best to rectify and enrich it, either because funds have not been generously raised, or because offices have not been assisted, or because talent evaluation has not been appropriate, or because work assessment has not been strict, so that each center still has an empty name without achieving practical results. In view of this, the Ministry of Education revised the Regulations on People's Education Centers and the Work Outline, Guidance Methods, etc. in April and May of the 28th year to ensure that the equipment is enriched, the organization is sound, and the personnel selection is appropriate. The work should be developed, and it is feared that the law alone is not enough to implement it. It is ordered to establish a class to train the directors of people's education centers in each county across the country. At the time of the implementation of the county-level organization outline and the renewal of political affairs, the Ministry then listed eight things and ordered the directors of education in each province to supervise their subordinates, pay close attention to the implementation. This method has comprehensive regulations for personnel, so that the people's education centers in each province can be effectively improved.

### He Tianjian Organizes Three Summer Vacation Training Classes in Chinese Painting

The famous painter He Tianjian has been selling paintings in Shanghai for nearly 30 years and has long been famous in the art world. He Tianjian, in view of the decline of Chinese painting, had long planned to hold solo exhibitions in North China and South China to promote national essence. Several years ago, he held an exhibition of hundreds of works in Beiping, which were all sold out in less than three days. Later, he planned to continue opening a solo exhibition in Hong Kong, but it has not been successful to this day. Those who seek his paintings over the years are very numerous. He Tianjian, in the midst of his busy schedule, still does not forget his long-standing aspiration to promote Chinese painting, so he takes time to teach Chinese painting, willing to pass on his life's learning to his students.

### International Cup Table Tennis A Group: Qingyun A Lodges Protest

In the International Cup Table Tennis A Group, Qingyun A and Youbang tied for first place with ten wins and one loss each. Due to the scoring record, Youbang was judged to be the champion. Upon hearing this, Qingyun A expressed extreme dissatisfaction, refused to accept the runner-up award, and submitted a written protest to the association, listing three reasons: (1) The notification letter for the match between our team and the Jewish Association was mistakenly sent to the address of the Sino-French Band Team, resulting in failure to arrive at the venue for the competition (previously, notification letters were sent to team leader Lu Hanjun), so the one point lost should be the responsibility of the association. (2) Since the scores of the two teams are equal, the championship should be re-determined. How can the first and second seats be judged based on the scoring record? The association did not announce this method beforehand, so it is difficult to accept. (3) Our team played against the Russian army earlier, and the Russian army temporarily requested a postponement at the team's ball room. The association actually approved the request, so the match between our team and the Jewish team can also be considered for postponement.

### British Troops in Shanghai Not Being Transferred - British Far East Policy Remains Unchanged - Strict Coastal Defense Checks Lead to Sluggish Cargo Traffic - Hong Kong Situation Affects Local Finance

According to yesterday's news report, a Reuters dispatch from London stated that British officials indicated the UK would transfer a small number of defense troops in Shanghai to Hong Kong. Yesterday, a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency specifically visited a British official to inquire about the truth. According to the official, there was no formal order from London, so it was not credible. However, "I can definitely say that the UK's Far East policy remains the same and has not changed." According to foreign sources, officials at the British military base in this city refused to comment on the rumored transfer of British troops stationed in China to Hong Kong in the near future, only stating that the information they had was already in the newspapers. According to diplomatic sources, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has met with many of the country's military and political officials stationed in China since this week. In addition, several influential British expatriates have also had audiences. The commander of the British garrison in Shanghai, Major General Simmons, also met with the British ambassador on the morning of the 2nd (yesterday). Major General Simmons had previously been injured in a horse riding accident and is now recovering.

The Local Financial Market Was Affected Yesterday

Since the situation in Hong Kong suddenly became tense, the local financial market had no immediate reaction due to the biannual financial industry holiday at the end of June. However, the financial market opened yesterday. Yesterday morning, it was generally expected that there would be significant changes. The only reason for this change was the general perception that the situation in Hong Kong was indeed extremely tense, with the risk of cargo traffic between here and Free China being cut off. According to reports, the value of goods stranded in Hong Kong is around 10 million yuan. Except for rice and coal, which can still be purchased from Annam at a higher value, other goods are severely restricted, leading to price increases. The reason for the price increase is that people are hoarding in preparation for future shortages. Other cargo traffic is affected by military factors, and it is said that all ships have already been reserved.

Chinese in Annam Flee in Large Numbers

The Times reported that, according to those arriving in Shanghai from the Annam coast, the Japanese naval power in the Gulf of Tonkin is increasing significantly and intensifying its activities. Japanese troops are gathering in Hainan Island, seemingly in larger numbers. Customs authorities, as a precaution, are strictly inspecting all travelers and issuing warnings. Travelers with any suspicion are immediately arrested. Chinese residing in Annam, seeing the tense situation in Annam, are planning to relocate to a better place, fleeing to Singapore and then to South China.

Hong Kong Coastal Defense Cargo Suddenly Sluggish

Affected by rumors, cargo traffic on the Shanghai-Hong Kong coastal defense route has suddenly become sluggish. Jardine Matheson's Taishing is scheduled to leave Shanghai today for Hong Kong coastal defense. The Sichuan is rescheduled to depart from Shanghai for Xiamen tomorrow (5th), via Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and then to Haiphong. Jardine Matheson's Glen Line, originally scheduled to sail to Hong Kong today, has been rescheduled to Bangkok due to the lack of passengers and cargo. Java Company's Geneva, departing today, is going to Xiamen via Hong Kong, Little Luzon, and returning to Surabaya. There is not much cargo from Hong Kong, but there are still many passengers.

If Britain Yields, the Far East Will Suffer

An editorial in the English-language China Review newspaper stated that the authorities in Hong Kong and Vietnam have ordered the evacuation of women and children from those two locations, and the crisis in South China is just beginning. The publication criticized Japan for seeking excuses to undermine agreements with British authorities in Hong Kong and advocated for complete freedom of action. The publication stated that if the British yield to Japan, not only will the British themselves suffer a fatal blow, but all countries with interests in the Far East will suffer as well.

Japanese Publications Criticize Britain

A special dispatch from Tokyo on July 3rd in the North-China Daily News said that Tokyo newspapers and magazines are publishing texts about the South Seas in a prominent position. "Miyako Shimbun" published a full page of photos and maps of Burma in the evening edition, strongly arguing for the close connection between Burma and Vietnam. A mass meeting was recently held in the Tokyo Public Hall, where many people gave speeches about the South Seas, denouncing Britain as an enemy of Japan. As for the evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong, the Japanese believe that it is due to the Hong Kong authorities' concerns about possible friction caused by Japanese military actions near Hong Kong. It is generally believed that the tense situation there can be overcome without any unexpected incidents. The Japanese have raised concerns about Burma and Hong Kong being supply routes for Chongqing. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, said that Britain needed more time to consider the matter, which made the Japanese feel resentful and believe that the British ambassador made this statement after consulting with the United States. However, the Japanese are confident that Britain will assure Japan that war supplies will no longer be transported to Chongqing via Hong Kong and Burma.

### Yu Hongjun Protests the Transfer of Land Bureau Documents - Violates Agreements and Greatly Harms Property Owners' Interests

Reuters, Chongqing, July 3rd: Former Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun, upon hearing that the Shanghai Municipal Council had resolved to hand over the Land Bureau documents, previously entrusted to the Council by the former Greater Shanghai Municipal Government, to Fu Xiao'an, sent a telegram to the Municipal Council today, lodging a serious protest. The telegram stated that the Council's action was a violation of the agreement and greatly harmed the interests of property owners in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign. Therefore, he requested the Municipal Council to reconsider its decision.

The Shanghai Municipal Council's official trusteeship of the Land Bureau documents from the Chinese government seems inevitably creating a loss of sympathy from both Chinese and foreigners by handing them over to a puppet regime not recognized by any country. According to a Japanese Embassy spokesman at a press conference last night, Municipal Council Secretary-General Phillips visited Miura, the Japanese Consul-General, at 2:30 PM yesterday to propose handing over the Land Bureau documents to the Japanese Consul-General. The Japanese Consul-General accepted the proposal and will complete the handover procedures tomorrow. Furthermore, according to yesterday's English-language China Press, the transfer of the Land Bureau documents by the Municipal Council will take place on the morning of the 5th. The Municipal Council will first hand over the documents to Japanese Consul-General Miura, who will then transfer them to the "Municipal Land Bureau." It is said that Xiao'an claimed that the "return" of the Land Bureau documents has paved the way for resolving the issue of road construction beyond the Settlement boundaries. It is said that there are three reasons affecting the implementation of the road construction beyond the Settlement boundaries "agreement": the "Special Police Force" issue, the tax and court issues, and the Land Bureau documents issue. Now that the Municipal Council has handed over the Land Bureau documents, there will be no changes in the puppet regime's management of the files, and everything will "proceed as usual."

### Song Ziwen's Mission to the United States - Highly Valued by All Parties - Financial Reputation Praised by the U.S. - Expected to Negotiate and Achieve Success

Mr. Song Ziwen, the Chinese financier who is carrying a major mission to the United States, has recently arrived in the United States and has begun discussions with American officials and the financial and trade sectors. All parties value his mission highly. Mr. Song was also ordered to go to the United States ten years ago to negotiate financial loans and achieved great success. When he returned to China, the people of Shanghai gave him a warm welcome. Mr. Song's second trip to the United States coincides with the third year of China's war of resistance against Japan, which is gradually approaching the final victory stage. At the same time, due to the European war, the situation in the Far East is unprecedentedly tense. Therefore, Mr. Song's trip is not only about purely Chinese financial issues but is actually related to the entire Far Eastern situation. It is expected that Mr. Song's mission to the United States will be to request the United States to provide new credit loans to assist China, urge the United States to pay attention to the overall situation in the Far East, and address the issue of rerouting Sino-US cargo traffic in the event of a blockade of Vietnam. Chinese officials here believe that Mr. Song's financial reputation has always been praised by the U.S. government and people, and they expect him to work hard to negotiate and achieve great success.

### French Concession Ratepayers Association - Again Blocks Tax Increase - French Municipal Council Will Respond Soon

Regarding the French Concession's increase of land tax to 0.3%, house tax to 7%, and other miscellaneous taxes to 50%, the Chinese Ratepayers Association previously sent a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting that the increase be suspended, but it was politely rejected. The Association sent another letter to the Municipal Council on the 30th of last month, stating that the French Concession has always had a surplus in its financial revenue and expenditure over the years. At this difficult time, the increase in taxes is unbearable for the citizens. Please reconsider, etc. Many days have passed since this letter was sent, and the French Municipal Council has not yet responded. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency asked the French authorities about this matter yesterday. According to them, the reply is currently being drafted and will generally be based on Announcement No. 218 of the French Consulate General in Shanghai.

### Shanghai's American Community Celebrates American Independence Today - Flag-Raising Ceremony This Morning - Review of the 4th Marine Regiment

U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Walter A. Adams, and the American community in Shanghai have decided to hold a grand celebration today, the 151st anniversary of Independence Day, in accordance with established customs. At 8:30 this morning, a flag-raising ceremony will be held in the open space of the Columbia Country Club on Great Western Road, presided over by Colonel Becker, commander of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment. Soldiers of the regiment will sing the national anthem, and the American expatriates of the city of Shanghai and American children from across Shanghai will attend. Colonel Becker, U.S. Consul General Adams, and Judge Helmick will give brief speeches. Mr. Adams may give flags to the American children present. After the flag-raising ceremony, the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment will hold maneuvers at the country club,

to be reviewed by Commander Colonel Becker. Admiral Hepburn, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol Fleet, and U.S. Consul Potter will be invited to view the maneuvers.

### North Henan Road - Yesterday's Situation

Cross-Streets Not Blocked - Resumption of Trolley Services In Sight

After the Japanese suddenly and completely removed the continuous iron wire and wooden frames that they had placed in North Jiangxi Road last summer, they started moving their defense lines westwards on the 2nd (the day before yesterday), extending to the east side of North Henan Road. They also erected six checkpoints along this line, from the northern end of Tianhou Temple Bridge in the south to the entrance of the Delong Tobacco Factory on Bazijie Road in the north. Further, they used small iron wire and wooden frames to block three alleys on the east side of North Henan Road. Details were in yesterday's issue of this newspaper. When the Japanese engineering team began deploying defenses the day before yesterday, they initially intended to choose the most congested intersections of the roads running east and west along North Henan Road and still block them with iron wire and wooden frames. They had already transported and piled up the iron wire piles and other materials needed for this purpose. However, when the reporter made a special inspection trip along North Henan Road yesterday morning, the aforementioned barrier materials had all been moved away. The Tram Company believes that since the roads through which trams pass in the northern district are generally unobstructed by wire netting, and in order to facilitate residents and develop transportation, it has heard that it will request the authorities to negotiate with the Japanese to restore the routes of all trolley cars, both rail-bound and trackless, that formerly ran in the district. Currently, since the Japanese have already lifted restrictions on entering and exiting the area east of their defense line, it is expected that this point may be easily resolved. As for the issue of police authority in the district, there seems to have been no developments recently. Patrolmen only patrol to the iron wire wooden frames that have been removed from North Jiangxi Road. Although their defense line has been extended westward by dozens of yards, the patrol endpoint has not retreated an inch.

### Grain and Rice Evaluation Committee - To Be Established Tomorrow - Rice Merchants to Visit Authorities Again This Morning

The Shanghai Soybean & Rice Trade Association, together with the Miscellaneous Grains and Oilseed Cake Industry, convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members on the 2nd of this month. As a result of the discussion, the Grain and Rice Evaluation Committee is scheduled to convene its inaugural meeting tomorrow, and it has been decided that members from the Soybean & Rice Trade, the Miscellaneous Grains Industry, the Rice Shop Industry, the Southern Gang, the Changbang Rice Guild, the Rice Milling Industry, the Distribution Industry, the Rice Market Management Committee, the Shanghai Northern Rice Merchants United Benefit Association, the Chaozhou Sugar Guild, Shen Shou Tang, Zhi Cheng Tang, Ji Yuan Tang, etc., will be invited, as well as representatives from the City Chamber of Commerce and the two Settlement authorities. The association has already appointed committee members Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and Zhang Nianxuan to visit the authorities again at 10:00 this morning, in addition to reporting the progress of industry consultations, and will personally invite representatives to participate in the Evaluation Committee and provide guidance. As for the City Chamber of Commerce, it has already sent a letter to notify

Rice Prices

In recent days, due to the tense situation in Hong Kong and the stagnation of Shanghai-Hong Kong shipping, the source of tribute rice has been affected to varying degrees. General rice merchants have even claimed that there is a shortage of supply, invisibly raising market prices. The authorities specifically ordered the Soybean and Rice Trade Association to quickly find a way to suppress rice prices the day before yesterday. All rice market transactions must not exceed the closing market price on June 29. Those who violate will be severely punished. The market price rose by two yuan the day before yesterday. The authorities are currently investigating and will punish those responsible. The rice shops and market opened as usual at 7:30 yesterday morning, and all goods were stationed at their original locations.

Flat Price Rice

The Shanghai Flat Price Rice Committee recently resolved that the fourth phase of flat price rice will be implemented starting on the 16th of this month and will continue to entrust 60 members of the Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association from the two Settlements to handle it, including 30 who sell tickets and 30 who distribute rice. The association has scheduled a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members for 3:00 PM on the 8th of this month to discuss the specific flat price rice measures. It is expected that the common people buying rice this time will be very crowded, so it is hoped that the police authorities of the two Settlements will dispatch a large number of detectives to rush to each flat price rice distribution point to protect and maintain order, so as to avoid various disputes. The rise in rice prices has made it difficult for the generally poorer people to make a living, so suppressing rice prices is an urgent task.

### The Two Settlements Take Unified Steps - Protecting Law-Abiding Citizens - "Wanted Orders" Dismissed as Rumors

According to a newspaper report, Wang Jingwei has issued "wanted orders" for 83 people he despises, including newspaper reporters, bankers, lawyers, Municipal Council officials, and customs officials. After this was reported in the newspaper, a Western reporter visited a senior official of the Municipal Police Department and was resolutely told that he could guarantee that Wang Jingwei would not be able to obtain the cooperation of the police authorities here to realize his intentions, and that all those "wanted" are among the most hardworking in their posts, and at the very least, they are all law-abiding citizens. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency received reliable information yesterday morning that the views of the French Concession police authorities are completely consistent with those of the Public Concession, and it is known that the matter has been contacted with the Public Concession police authorities. Both parties have decided to take unified steps. In order to verify this news, the reporter visited a senior French official yesterday afternoon to inquire whether the information obtained by the reporter was reliable and to request his attitude. According to him, the French side has not received any notification from any party regarding this matter. The "wanted order" is only seen in newspapers, and we only regard it as a rumor. He solemnly stated that the French Concession authorities will give full protection to all law-abiding people of all countries within the Concession.

### Post Office Launches Airmail to Europe Via the United States

Since the expansion of the European War, the Eurasian air route has been blocked. Now, according to the Post Office's announcement, it is launching airmail to Europe via the United States.

In addition to the ordinary airmail postage of 50 cents per 20 centimeters, an additional 5 yuan and 40 cents is charged for every 5 centimeters. The entire journey takes only 15 days. However, mail must be marked on the envelope,

### The City Federation of Trade Unions Sends a Telegram of Condolences to Air Force Soldiers - And Encourages the Citizens of Chongqing to Work Hard for the Country

We especially send a telegram to express our condolences and wish you all hard work for the country. Shanghai City Federation of Trade Unions kowtows, Jiang."

### Cost of Living Index for June - Rice Prices Rise Most Sharply - Speculators Take Advantage of Psychology and the Situation - Purchasing Power of Currency Decreases by Another 2.5%

The cost of living index and retail prices for workers in Shanghai in June 1940 are as follows: General wholesale prices tended to decline this month, and foreign exchange also eased, but the cost of living index for workers still rose quite sharply. The index for this month is 422.91, an increase of 40 points from last month, or 10.45%, breaking the previous high of 382.91 in May. Among the classified indexes, the increase in food was the most severe. The index for May was 383.24, and it rose sharply to 451.74 in June. The increase in miscellaneous items was very small, and there was a significant decrease in clothing. The index for May was 403.85, and it was only 360.00 in June. The fuel index only fell by 2.59%. If the price of briquettes had not risen in the second half of June, the fall would have been even greater. The purchasing power of currency decreased by another 2.5% this month, to 23.65 cents.

Soaring Rice Prices

The rise in the June index is largely due to the sharp rise in rice prices. The price of premium japonica rice reached 74.5 yuan per shi on the 20th, which is an unprecedentedly high price in this city. The average price of No. 1 japonica rice in June was 60.39 yuan per shi, a sharp increase of 29.48% from May. No. 2 Saigon rice was 55.95 yuan, up 16.77%. The reasons for the increase are: (1) Rice prices inevitably rise during the period between harvests; (2) The prolonged drought affects the autumn harvest; (3) Rice prices are expensive in Ningbo, Shaoxing and other places, stimulating prices in this city; (4) Flour production is reduced due to the control of wheat; (5) A large quantity of military rice is purchased in the production areas; (6) Vietnam is the source of rice and coal, and the tense situation affects rice prices; (7) Citizens hoard large quantities of rice in view of the daily increase in rice prices. However, this is still far from the period between harvests, and it is the yellow plum rainy season. The rainy season started on June 12 and ended on July 15 this year. There was rain around June 14, and there was even more rain from the 23rd to the end of the month. According to the Xujiahui Observatory report, there was a total of 3.5 inches of rain throughout the month. In addition, there is sufficient grain storage, the source has not been cut off, and a large amount of Vietnamese rice has been ordered. Moreover, general wholesale prices have fallen this month, and foreign exchange is more relaxed than in May. Therefore, the rise in rice prices is inconsistent with the general trend of prices. The reason for this serious situation is nothing more than speculators taking advantage of psychology and the situation. It is hoped that the general public will not purchase large quantities of rice other than what is needed when prices rise sharply, then the rumors will subside, and prices will fall.

Fuel Has Not Fallen

As for briquettes, the price reached 8 yuan per dan around the 20th of this month. Since May, the price of briquette raw materials has increased instantly when the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar shrank sharply at the beginning of last month, calculated in U.S. dollars. This month, the exchange rate is extremely relaxed, but there is no sign of a corresponding price decrease. This city has the most sufficient coal storage, and the source has not been cut off. Even if the situation in Vietnam is tense, why would the price rise immediately? In short, rice, briquettes, and rent are the three most important things for the livelihoods of citizens. If all three rise, all things will inevitably become more expensive. Therefore, if we want prices to fall, we should first suppress the prices of these three, then the citizens will have a chance to recover.

### Since Using Mianli... ○

— Chen Lijuan

Mianli, Mianli. My classmates are all clamoring for this familiar name. Sister Lan has to apply it in front of the mirror every morning. A subtle, quiet Mianli fragrance lingers around. I am captivated. Xue specially rushed to the Tongren Pharmacy after class today to buy a bottle. She even showed off its benefits to me. Hui also praised the effectiveness of Mianli. So it moved me to change my mind and use Mianli. When I tried Mianli for the first time, I felt that the powder was fine and smooth, moisturizing but not greasy. When applied to the face, it is smooth and white. I no longer need to apply other scented powders. Moreover, most scented powders contain lead, which only damages the skin, making it dull, yellow, and rough. So since I started using Mianli, all scented powders and all types of snow powders have been discarded. The fragrance of Mianli, as far as I know, is a subtle floral fragrance. But Sister Lan says it smells a bit like milk. How can Mianli use milk? I don't think so. If it really uses milk, wouldn't that be great for nourishing the body and the skin? I don't know if Mianli uses milk. But Mianli does have the great effects of milk. Since I started using Mianli, the most significant effect is that my skin has a crystal clear color, vibrant and radiant, like newly glazed porcelain, like fresh flowers in the dew. I used to use makeup because my skin was pale and rough before applying makeup. If I didn't add some makeup, I couldn't even see people. Now it's better. These problems are gone. And the large pores have shrunk. So my skin is much more delicate. At the same time, I received a report from Xue that her freckles have also been cured. Overjoyed, I wrote a few words to thank the inventor of Mianli.

### British Territories Spare No Effort to Assist Britain in the War; Canada, Australia, and Others Implement Conscription and Intensify Munitions Production to Steadily Support Britain

According to an American recently arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines, Britain's situation is indeed more serious than before due to the capitulation of its ally France. However, fortunately, in this severe situation, the various territories of the empire not only remain loyal to the mother country but also spare no effort to assist Britain.

Canada Has Expedited Munitions Production

For example, the Canadian government has recently instructed munitions factories, shipyards, and aircraft factories across the country to work day and night shifts, abolishing all holidays, in order to increase production. The number of bullet factories has increased from eight to fourteen. With regard to infantry, in light of the current situation in Europe, training is being intensified, with plans to establish a fourth division. The quota of 5,000 reserve air force pilots has also been conscripted and training has begun immediately.

Australia Formulates Conscription Regulations

In Australia, aircraft factories and munitions factories are working in shifts, each shift lasting twelve hours. All work is under the direction of one person, with the aim of increasing production so as to obtain the maximum output in the shortest possible time. The Australian government has recently loaned £20 million to Britain. Conscription regulations have been formulated, and all conscripted recruits are concentrated in large venues across the country. However, due to the shortage of housing, a considerable number of recruits can only temporarily reside at home and receive training according to a set schedule. Consequently, training facilities are distributed throughout various locations. Australia is not paying much attention to its own defense, as the urgency of the situation compared to the European front is self-evident. Aircraft ordered by Australia from the United States have all been rerouted to Britain, and trained air force personnel serving in Australia will also be sent to Europe. In total, Australia has more than 84,000 air force personnel, including 14,000 pilots and 70,000 service personnel.

New Zealand Forms Wartime Parliament

New Zealand has recently established a unified wartime parliament of all parties. The parliament has recently enacted a law similar to that in Britain, stipulating that the lives and property of all people shall be subject to the government. In addition, New Zealand is steadily exporting cotton, wool, meat, and other commodities useful to the mother country to Britain. In Africa, local authorities have recently been authorized to requisition at any time any houses, open spaces, food supplies, means of transportation, and other properties that are beneficial to defense. India has organized and dispatched 100,000 new troops, and the number of air force personnel has quadrupled. Even British citizens in India are being conscripted and deployed. As for munitions production, it has increased twelvefold compared to when the war broke out.

### Fake Police Arrest People in Yue Opera Theater

At around 8:00 PM last night, while a Yue opera performance was underway at a certain Yue opera theater located at 1151 Avenue Haig, French Concession, suddenly dozens of fake police officers barged in. The audience, witnessing the entry of the fake police, became extremely frightened and rushed out, causing chaos. After entering, the fake police, without asking any questions, went straight to the backstage of the theater and arrested two staff members: Zhang Wenrong, a native of Shaoxing, and a Mr. Liu. They were taken to the fake police station inside Jiaotong University. The French Concession police received a report and dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene, but all the fake police officers had already dispersed. The police conducted a thorough investigation. The reason for the arrest of the two staff members is currently under investigation by the police.

### Abduction of Du Xuexuan; Rickshaw Puller Highly Suspected; Origins of the Car Used by the Abductors Ascertained; Car Driven to a Gambling Den, Whereabouts Unknown

Du Xuexuan, manager of the Datong Silver Company at 280 Beijing Road, resided at No. 1, Lane 672, Hart Road. At 9:15 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, Du left home, intending to take the No. 10 bus on Connaught Road to go to the company to handle business. However, just as he stepped out of the lane entrance, he was suddenly

abducted by four kidnappers who forced him into a car that had been waiting by the roadside and sped away. Du's family reported the incident to the Gordon Road police station, and Chinese detective Xie Zhiguang was dispatched to investigate. According to Du's family, they had not received any threatening letters beforehand. Subsequently, it was discovered that the license plate number of the car hired by the gang was 17945, belonging to the Xinzha Motor Company. The police then located the driver of the car, Zhou Chaoliang, who claimed that he had received a phone call from the

Rongsheng Gambling Den on Yananping Road (now renamed "Shanghai General Association") to hire a car. After driving there, four people got into the car and first went to the Museum Road, then to the scene of the incident. The four people got out of the car, and another person got in. They then drove to the entrance of the Rongsheng Gambling Den, where they got out. At that time, they entered the Rongsheng and paid the fare of three yuan. The detectives believed that since Zhou had encountered such an incident, he should have immediately reported it to the police station. However, Zhou did not do so, and the police had to search for him for a long time before finding him. Therefore, Zhou was suspected of

collusion and was taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, explained the case, stating that since the victim had not yet been found, he requested permission to detain Zhou temporarily and reschedule the hearing. Judge Liu reviewed the report and ordered Zhou to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.

### After the Death of Shao Xubai; The Funeral Will Be Held Today

All Circles Mourn with Utmost Solemnity; The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Cables Requesting the Arrest of the Murderers

Mr. Shao Xubai, president of the Daguang News Agency, unfortunately met with a tragic death on the evening of the first day of the month. His remains have been moved to the Shanghai Funeral Home. Yesterday, Chinese and foreign friends visited to pay their respects in an endless stream. The details are described below:

The Funeral Will Be Held Today

After Shao's death, as a result of severe injuries, his remains were moved to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road. The family has decided to hold the funeral at the funeral home at 10:00 AM today (the 4th). It is expected that there will be a large procession of plain cars and white horses, demonstrating utmost solemnity.

Mourning from All Circles

Since learning of the tragic news, the Chinese and Western press circles in Shanghai and Shao's friends visited the Shanghai Funeral Home to pay their respects. Yesterday, six foreign reporters and more than fifty people from the press, business circles, and Shao's friends visited to pay their respects and view the remains.

Cables Requesting the Arrest of the Murderers

The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions specially cabled the central government yesterday, requesting the arrest of the murderers and the provision of preferential treatment. The cable reads: "To the Central Party Headquarters in Chongqing: Comrade Shao Suibai, a member of our federation, dedicated himself to the revolution and wholeheartedly supported the national policy of resistance and reconstruction, which incurred the jealousy of certain parties. He was assassinated by thugs on the first day of the month, and the shocking news has spread throughout the city. We implore your esteemed department to forward this to the police authorities, to strictly arrest the perpetrators, bring them to justice, and provide preferential treatment to honor the laws of the nation and comfort the loyal soul. The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions bows in respect, Jiang Yin."

Condolences to the Family

"To Mrs. Shao Xubai, the wife of Committee Member Xubai: We were shocked and saddened to learn of Mr. Xubai's assassination by thugs. We believe that Mr. Xubai dedicated himself to the revolution and contributed to the party and the nation. He sought benevolence and obtained it, so he can have no regrets. In addition to cabling the central government to strictly arrest the perpetrators and provide preferential treatment to comfort the loyal soul, we also pray that you restrain your grief and carry on the great cause. The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and all executive and supervisory committee members bow in respect."

### The Closing of the Five-Religion Lecture; The Meritorious Work is Completed with Excellent Results; The Imam of Islam Advocates a Grand Union of the Five Religions

Yesterday was the last day of the Five-Religion Lecture. Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang lectured on the essentials of Buddhism and its practice. The number of attendees was even greater than in the previous four days. In addition to the seats that were temporarily added on the previous two days, another hundred or so seats were added, but it still felt insufficient. This shows that the public's interest in religion is deeper than initially expected. Jiang's lecture covered the doctrines of Buddhism, believing that all things in the world are due to cause and condition. Cause and condition lead to result. For example, sowing rice seeds is the cause, and adding artificial cultivation and the nourishment of timely rain and dew is the condition. The sowing of the cause and the meeting of the condition lead to the result of bearing fruit as grain. Therefore, creating good causes and forming good conditions leads to good results, and creating bad causes and forming bad conditions leads to bad results. The birth and death of people is also the same principle. It is also said that all forms are born from the mind, so one should seek to remove the deluded mind and seek the true mind. He also explained the process of Sakyamuni's cultivation to become a Buddha and the passing down of scriptures, explaining the Six Paramitas, the Five Precepts, the Greater and Lesser Vehicles, and various sects in great detail. Afterwards, Mr. Feng Bingnan's fourth son, Zhenwei, delivered the closing address, stating that this Five-Religion Lecture was like sowing the seeds of goodness. He hoped that these seeds could gradually sprout, develop, blossom, and bear fruit, and that the fruit could then be sown again, from one to ten, from ten to a hundred, from a hundred to a thousand, and from a thousand to ten thousand, spreading throughout the universe, so that all mankind could advance to the utmost good. The Buddha's teachings are vast and boundless, and the will of man is also vast and boundless. With the vast aspirations and vast power of millions of people, seeking the improvement of all mankind, sincerity is enough to move heaven, earth, ghosts, and gods, let alone mankind. He dares to believe that there will be a day when it will be achieved. Only in this way will the holding of the Five-Religion Lecture not be in vain. He then recounted the social welfare enterprise initiated by his esteemed father, saying that the scale of the enterprise is relatively large and the work is relatively heavy. It cannot be undertaken by the power of one person alone, and it is even more necessary to rely on the collective wisdom and efforts of people from all walks of life in order to achieve success. His father felt that there were many areas in society that needed improvement from a young age, so starting twenty or thirty years ago, he saved a portion of his annual income each year to prepare for the future establishment of social welfare enterprises. Therefore, since the August 13th Incident, his assets have been almost completely depleted, but he has not touched a single cent of the funds saved for the social enterprise. Several of his friends, who had been deeply helped by his esteemed father in business, repeatedly offered large sums of money as compensation, but his esteemed father never accepted a single cent. Upon hearing of the initiation of the social welfare enterprise and the difficulty of limited capacity, they offered their full support, so the social welfare enterprise was able to take shape and begin planning. What his esteemed father bears is only a quarter or a fifth of the existing funds of the society. These several friends who provided support did good deeds without wanting to be known, so their names are not yet convenient to announce. He also said that although the social welfare enterprise has some subsidy regulations, the subsidies are limited to those who can help themselves and need assistance from others. If they cannot help themselves and hope to gain without labor, then the society dare not sympathize with them and encourage laziness. At the time of the closing ceremony, Mr. Xue Ziming, the Imam of the Shanghai Fuyou Road Mosque and the President of the Shanghai Islamic Scripture Research Society, was invited to express his views. Due to the limited time, he gave only a brief five-minute speech, using the analogy of a large family with five brothers, each engaged in their own business and not consulting with each other, each affirming their own views and not tolerating others. As a result, there was a great deal of friction within the family. Fortunately, an old man summoned them and told them the principles of cooperation and harmony, and from then on they became harmonious and the family was at peace. These five brothers are the five religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam, and the one who summoned them with the principles of cooperation and harmony was Mr. Feng Bingnan. He deeply hoped that from today onwards, the five religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam would form a grand alliance to seek the peace of the family, etc.

### A Dismissed Police Detective Colludes with Bandits; Abducts a Coal Broker; Initiated the Plot After Extorting Coal Company Failed; Six Criminals Arrested and the Hostage Rescued

The Rongyu Coal Company at No. 2, Lane 475, Pushi Road, has a strong capital. At 6:30 AM on the morning of the 30th of this month, six kidnappers suddenly came to the coal company and abducted the Ningbo broker Jiang Beihai. Afterwards, they sent a letter demanding a ransom of 4,000 yuan and designated the Wugong Hotel at the intersection of Simar Road and Shilu as the place to negotiate. The victim reported the letter to the French police station, and the police chief dispatched detectives to

do their best to investigate. They learned that the bandits' den was on North Sichuan Road. They then coordinated with the Japanese Command in Hongkou and went to the address, where they arrested on the spot Bu Guangquan (24 years old this year), a Zhenjiang native who had previously served as a detective in the French police station. They also confiscated two pistols and rescued the hostage Jiang Beihai from danger. Based on Bu's confession, the police continued to apprehend five accomplices: Hao Jinlin, Fang Donglin, Jiang Guiqing, Wang Ahua, and Jiang Yongjin, all natives of Ningbo. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, all the criminals were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 District Court. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, requested a postponement because the administrative authorities

had not yet completed the investigation. According to the report of the investigating detectives, the cause of the case was that Fang Donglin, Jiang Guiqing, and Wang Ahua, all of whom were workers at the coal company, learned that Rongyu Company had made a great profit this year. Jiang Yongjin claimed that his brother-in-law, Shen Mingfa, worked as a translator for the Japanese and could find a way to make the company willing to pay a large sum of money. They then colluded with Bu Hao and others to

extort money. When that failed, they abducted Jiang. According to the hostage Jiang Beihai, the defendants first came to the store at 2:30 PM on the 28th of last month, claiming that the coal in the store was all Japanese goods and that 100 silver dollars were required as compensation. He refused. Bu and others then designated the Pinfang Tea House on Juli Road as the place to negotiate the next day. He went there at the designated time, but there were no results. Unexpectedly, at 6:30 AM on the morning of the 3rd, Bu led five foreign ruffians to the store, looking for the owner to negotiate. Since the owner was not there, they abducted him and hid him in

No. 469, 4th floor, Old Barde Road, North Jiangxi Road. Later, he was rescued by the French police. When questioned, all the defendants denied going to the victim's store with the ruffians to abduct him. They all claimed that they went to demand money for a society. The rest of the confessions were evasive. Judge Zhang Minsheng questioned them and ordered the case to be postponed to the 17th for further questioning. All the defendants were detained.

### Japanese Military Vehicles Drove Through the French Concession Yesterday

A Strange Phenomenon Initially Discovered Within the Concession

According to the English-language "Great Evening Post," this morning (the 3rd) at 10:00 AM, a squadron of Japanese motorcycles led four military trucks, speeding past Avenue Joffre. Residents of the French Concession found it quite strange, as it was the first time since the outbreak of the Shanghai War in 1937 that Japanese military vehicles had been seen passing through the French Concession. It has been investigated that the French Concession authorities previously restricted the passage of Japanese military vehicles through the territory. Recently, the French and Japanese authorities in the city reached an agreement to cancel the restriction. Therefore, it is expected that Japanese military vehicles will continue to pass through the French Concession to travel between Nanshi and Hongqiao in the future.

### Charitable Organizations Actively Evacuate Refugees

Since the August 13th Incident, the joint disaster relief committee of charitable organizations has provided relief to a large number of refugees in the war zone. At its peak, it accommodated more than 200,000 refugees in more than 70 shelters. The committee has no funding and relies entirely on donations from all walks of life to maintain its operations. Recently, donations have dwindled, and with the soaring price of rice and the high cost of everything, it is extremely difficult to cope. It has no choice but to actively evacuate and resettle the refugees separately. In addition to those elderly, disabled, widowed, and orphaned who have no home to return to, who will be relocated and continue to be accommodated, it has also been agreed to close the Cilin and Gonghua centers within a limited time. Teachers at the Cilian Middle School and other institutions will be temporarily suspended from work during the summer vacation, according to school practice. Because there is no rice to cook, the problem of refugee living is still difficult, so it is necessary to tighten all expenses. Currently, the number of people being accommodated is around 5,700. Within the possible range, it is necessary to find ways to evacuate them.

### A Strange Solar Phenomenon

A Black Halo Surrounding the Sun, Edged with Colored Light

According to the English-language "Great Evening Post," a very rare phenomenon was discovered in the high sky at noon today (the 3rd). A black halo surrounded the sun, and the edges were tinged with colored light, resembling clouds, but appearing higher than the cloud layer. The sun was still clearly visible, and sunlight continued to shine through the black circle. The Xujiahui Observatory is currently busy studying the phenomenon but has not yet explained its cause.

Another report states that at around 1:20 PM yesterday, a huge dark gray circle suddenly appeared around the blazing sun in the sky. The outer ring of the circle had colored edges that resembled a rainbow but were not quite like one. At that time, the sunlight was also slightly dimmed. By 1:55 PM, the gray light in the northern part first disappeared, and it completely disappeared by 2:00 PM. Those in the know said it was a solar halo.

### Unstable Environment, Gold Market Depressed

Yesterday, the spot gold dark market showed a slight decline, but people's hearts were clearly weak and depressed. This was due to the impact of various unstable situations. Although foreign exchange tightened after easing, gold prices ultimately failed to rise. The opening price in the early morning was 5,410 yuan, which was 20 yuan lower than the closing price before the holiday. Later, it rose slightly, but unexpectedly, the money exchange banks unanimously sold off, and the silver shops also dumped their holdings, which was most noteworthy. After this considerable selling pressure, it fell to 5,330 yuan. Later, with the support of the securities firms and money exchange businesses, some were bought back, raising the price by several tens of yuan before closing. The result was only 5,345 yuan, a drop of 85 yuan compared to before the holiday. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. The half-day trading was still active, around 2,000 taels. Silver jewelry ultimately quoted a small increase of ten yuan, while customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Fell by 85 Yuan

Since morning, each bar (ten taels), initially due to weak market sentiment, a certain money exchange business first called for selling, and the opening price was immediately 20 yuan lower than before the holiday. The money exchange business offered silver shops ten taels for 5,410 yuan. Shortly after, another money exchange business sold 20 taels to a gold shop for 5,415 yuan. After that, buyers watched and waited, and the silver shops tended to sell. At the same time, money exchange businesses and retail investors were full of selling intentions. Soon, it continued to fall by 85 yuan. A silver shop offered ten taels to a silver business, at a lower price of 5,330 yuan. Then, another money exchange business came to buy at the low price, and the sellers had also decreased. Moreover, thanks to the healthy appetite of the securities firms, the price gradually rose, with a silver business offering ten taels to a gold shop, rising to 5,380 yuan. At noon, the number of buyers decreased again, and the silver shops and retail investors frequently sold off, making it 35 yuan lower again.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Rise and Fall Suddenly, Foreign Stocks Fall by 10%

The securities dark market resumed normal operations yesterday after a three-day holiday. During these three days, the complexity of the concession issue, the evolution of the international situation, and the news of Mr. Song Ziwen's arrival in the United States were all significant and not irrelevant. However, the market's feeling was still quite numb, because most of the current market transactions are temporary in nature, with sudden entries and exits, which does not affect the market. Large holders of spot goods still have deep faith and are not shaken by the environment, and are already in an unshakable position. The amount of spot goods held by general retail investors is limited. As the interest payment is approaching, they do not want to suffer this unnecessary sacrifice. Yesterday morning, Cunyi Qianzhuang bought Class A bonds, No. 16 bought Class E bonds, and Le Mao needed both Class A and Class E bonds. Retail investors gathered on Class C bonds, but No. 20, Lianyi, Renchang, and others supplied a lot. The market price was only slightly stronger for Class A bonds. In the afternoon, No. 20 bought Class E bonds again, and Tongshun, Lianhe, and Jiufeng were all very interested in Class C bonds, but No. 38 sold a particularly large amount of Class C bonds. Class A bonds suddenly had sellers but no buyers, causing them to weaken. Therefore, the result was that Class B and Class D bonds did not rise or fall, and the rest only fell by a small 1/5 to 1/10 of a yuan. The transaction volume was more than 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified Class A, 61.45, 61.25, 61.15, down 0.10

Unified Class B, 52.0, 51.90, 51.90, flat

Unified Class C, 50.30, 50.20, 50.2, down 0.05

Unified Class D, 48.80, --, 48.80, flat

Unified Class E, 50.00, 49.95, 50.00, down 0.05

In stock trading, 50 shares of Qingfeng Yarn Factory were traded at a price of 75 yuan. The stock market prices published in this newspaper are based on those that have already been settled. Any prices with only buyers but no sellers, or only sellers but no buyers, or even large differences between buying and selling quotations, are not factual and are not listed.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Association opened with weak market sentiment, because the news spread during the holiday was unstable and serious. All prices generally fell by 10% compared to before the holiday, but at low prices, there were quite a few buyers maintaining the market, and the closing trend was stable. Rubber stocks were bleak, with only British Java having considerable demand at 19 yuan and Di Bang at 1 yuan.

### Grain: Rice Prices Slightly Soft

The supply of foreign rice continues. In addition to the arrival of more than 10,000 bags previously, it is said that 20,000 to 30,000 bags arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is also reported that four ships booked in mid-June are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, and a large number of Siamese rice orders are expected to arrive in Shanghai before mid-June. Under the strict restrictions of the authorities, speculators inevitably have concerns, and many who have made profits take the opportunity to sell. Therefore, prices fell all the way after the market opened. No. 1 Saigon rice fell to 65.20 yuan, No. 2 to 63.35 yuan, fire-cooked rice to within 65 yuan, and Xiao Wen rice to 62 yuan. Although prices rebounded a few cents at the close, they were still nearly one yuan lower than the price limit, and two to three yuan lower than the previous day's above-limit price. Trading slowed down, with less than 4,000 bags traded in the entire half-day. Recycled rice in 18-bag packages was 73 yuan, and in 26-bag packages, it was 70 yuan, nearly 100 tons.

Foreign rice continues to arrive. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng arrived in Shanghai, carrying 11,502 bags from Hong Kong, berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (祖)

For japonica and glutinous domestic rice, more than 1,000 bags of japonica rice have arrived. There is a shortage of glutinous rice. It is rumored that in the off-market japonica rice dark market, given the sluggishness of foreign rice, market sentiment is also soft, and few transactions are made. Selling prices have fallen by nearly one yuan. Changbang special clear japonica rice is 74.35 yuan to 74 yuan, and Su Kun Changzhou white japonica rice ranges from 72-73 yuan, followed by Su Re at 69.50 yuan, Qing Si special thin rice at 74.20 yuan, Da Shi at 72-73 yuan, Su Jue at 70 yuan, Nan Gang early rice at 71-70 yuan. Due to the lack of glutinous rice, although the sales market is limited, the market sentiment remains firm, and the market is particularly good, more than half a yuan higher. Jin Li special yuan rice is 63.50 yuan to 63 yuan, and Chang Dan white yuan rice is 62.50 yuan to 61 yuan, Jiangbei white yuan rice ranges from 60 yuan to 59 yuan, it is said.

### Flour Firm and Expensive, Wheat Arrivals Still Scarce

Flour: Yesterday's market remained firm and stable. After the No. 2 flour mill increased prices three times last week, the authorities have strictly supervised and limited rice prices, which must not exceed the closing price of June 29th. The retail price of Lao Che brand flour must not exceed 15.50 yuan per bag. Therefore, it is difficult for the mill price to increase again, but the more expensive rice becomes, the more flour sales increase. It is estimated that the two mills directly sold 1,500 bags in total throughout the day. The recycled goods price stood at 16.45 yuan, and the customer price was above 17 yuan, but no formal agreements were reached. However, in recent days, Japanese-made flour from the mainland has been shipped to Shanghai. It is reported that Jinshan brand is offered at 16 yuan, and more than 1,000 bags have also been traded.

Wheat: Although new wheat sources have arrived in batches in recent days, they are not transported by Chinese merchants, and the peak period of arrivals may still be awaited. Currently, both Japanese and Chinese mills are showing a trend of releasing and buying up inventory. It is reported that the foreign company Johnson & Co. purchased 200 bags of Wuhu wheat at a price of 25.10 yuan, and Fuxin Mill also purchased 250 bags at the same price. There is no news of formal transactions in the market. Other small-scale purchases by Japanese mills cannot be regarded as part of the formal market discussion.

### Yarn and Cotton: Coarse Yarn Still Has Good Sales, Double Horse Plummets and Slightly Rebounds

Yesterday, the yarn market resumed business as usual after the bank closed. The market condition started weak and then leveled off. This was because actual transactions were still good. Both Hong Kong and Yunnan merchants had a strong demand for coarse yarn. Therefore, the stagnant market was completely offset by immediate sales, despite the serious situation in Hong Kong. According to South China merchants, the purchased yarn was re-routed for shipment, transferring from Yangon to Kunming. Therefore, market sentiment has recovered. However, yesterday morning's spot market price was 30 yuan cheaper than the mill warehouse price, showing a clear inverted market situation. Although Hong Kong and Yunnan are procuring, it is still difficult to reverse this weak market. 20-count Double Horse yarn is still hovering within the 900 yuan range.

The opening price of spot yarn in the morning was due to reports of a tense situation in Hong Kong, which was the biggest factor of market unrest. Therefore, market sentiment was weak, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 865 yuan, a drop of 60 yuan before the closure. However, a portion of it was bought back, rebounding to 885 yuan. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange was softening, and it turned downward again, weakening to 870 yuan. Finally, thanks to good procurement by Yunnan and Hong Kong merchants, with 1,300 bales traded, it rose to 887 yuan at the close. It is found that 2,940 bales were traded in the half-day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 38 yuan. Today, 30 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each merchant group is listed as follows:

Same trade 1,380, Hong Kong 685

Yunnan 740, Mainland 70

Ningbo 125, Total 2,940

### Indian Cotton Plummets, Orders Arrive Steadily

The situation of spot cotton remains lifeless, because the yarn market is mediocre, coupled with the rampant decline in overseas Indian cotton, so people's hearts are even less excited. The Indian cotton ordered by various parties in the past is still arriving steadily. However, Japanese mills have a slight appetite, but the payment delay is one to two months later. The Chinese mills are quieter.

The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, fell in the early morning due to pressure from sellers. Later, due to good spot transactions and some purchases of new cotton, the closing price of the near-term contract fell by 8 points compared to the previous day, while the far-term contract rebounded by 2-3 points. Due to transportation difficulties in India, local merchants are selling off in the market, resulting in a sharp drop in selling prices. Yesterday, the predicted father fell by more than 7 rupees.

In the Shanghai cotton trading market, it is widely rumored that British goods will no longer be loaded on Japanese ships. If this is true, then only British company ships may be able to transport them. However, British ships need to transport too many goods. In the future, the arrival of Indian cotton in Shanghai will be even scarcer, and the opportunity to hoard spot goods may be inevitable. Therefore, stimulated by this news, the intention of the industry is unusually firm. However, trading has been sluggish recently. Apart from some scattered transactions by Japanese mills in the old silver futures market, the Chinese mills are unusually quiet.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Mills Actively Buying Soybeans, Prices Remain High

Yesterday's soybean market condition, because the source was slightly continued, plus it was difficult for hoarders to hold goods in their hands for a long time. The market was deadlocked until yesterday, when the oil mills showed strong potential for active buying, with buyers and sellers both active, resulting in a lively trade in the half-day. Prices remained firm and high. It is estimated that more than 3,000 bags of Qingdao beans were traded at a price of 30 yuan, 18 cartloads of Bengbu beans at a price of 29 yuan, more than 1,000 bags of Anqing beans at a price of 28.50 yuan to 29.20 yuan, and 400 bags of Dalian mixed green beans at a price of 31 yuan, 500 bags of Xiao Dong Du beans at a price of 28.90 yuan to 29.40 yuan, and 100 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans at a price of 27 yuan, it is said.

In addition, 637 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Exchange Eases, Coarse White Sugar Falls

Yesterday's sugar market saw prices fall together due to the easing of foreign exchange. The association's listed prices were 69.70 yuan for the current 24 group white sugar in original packaging, and 69 yuan for other sugar, a drop of about 1 yuan. Transit goods were 54.50 yuan, and warehouse receipts for delivery on July 10th were 55.20 yuan, a drop of 1.50 to 1.60 yuan. Taikoo coarse white sugar B mark was 80 yuan to 79.50 yuan, a drop of 1.50 to 2 yuan. HY mark was 77.50 yuan, Dutch red sugar was down a little at 57.50 yuan, Ben Yun white sugar was 69.50 yuan, No. 1 rock sugar was 91.50 yuan, and Jing Ming ice was 93 yuan. However, domestic sugar remained stable. Dia Qing opened for more than 100 bags of Taikoo ship arrivals at 64.50 yuan, up 0.50 yuan, and dozens of baskets of Tiao Qing at 46 yuan. Also, 200 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Falls Step by Step

Domestic cloth: Yesterday's market prices were firm at the opening due to the strong momentum before the closure. However, as there were few buyers, the selling prices fell step by step. As a result, each piece of white fine cloth, twill, and coarse cloth fell by 0.25 yuan to 0.50 yuan. The selling prices of bleached, dyed, and printed cloth varied greatly, falling by about 1 yuan. The wholesale shops on Mu Street catered to the traffic along both sides of the roads and in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, dealing in more than 8,000 pieces of coarse cloth and bleached cloth. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi merchants dealt in 150-160 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. The Henan merchants saw a sharp decline in shipments due to the emergency of the war on the Longhai Railway. The Guangdong-Yunnan merchants were also in a state of stagnation. However, the northern Tianjin merchants dealt in more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and woolen goods.

Eastern cloth: Yesterday morning's opening market sentiment was firm, with Longtou fine cloth seeing 31.50 yuan. Unexpectedly, the industry dumped their holdings, and customers were helpless, leading to a step-by-step decline, with a particularly strong downward trend. The closing price of the later market fell to 28.75 yuan. Four Gentlemen's Serge fell from 0.90 yuan per yard to 0.845 yuan. From a sales perspective, there is still a lack of good prospects in the short term. It is faintly heard that the Japanese factories have reduced working hours by 30% since July 1st, hoping to maintain the falling market price, but the result may be difficult to achieve.

Exports: 19 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Arrives in Shanghai Continuously

A large batch of Wuxi white raw silk arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, transported from Wuxi by Hua Cheng, Fuxing, Chaojing, etc., totaling about 300 piculs. The export method is roughly a special expenditure of 300 yuan per picul. It is heard that the finished products of the Wuxi silk mills have accumulated to more than 1,000 piculs. After the beginning of July, the export problem will be even more difficult. Yesterday, 10 pieces of raw silk came from Hong Kong, and 3 major bundles of artificial silk also came.

### Medicinal Materials: More Arrivals of Rosary Peas, Prices Fall by 50-60 Yuan

Since the previous market opened rosary peas at 200 yuan, the consignors were able to profit quite a bit. Therefore, there are many continuous shipments to Shanghai, so the stock in the market is quite abundant. However, in recent days, sales have been slow, leading to a sudden drop in sales. Currently, the best grade with no black spots is 150 yuan, and the next grade is 140 yuan, but there are few buyers. Compared with the previous market, it has to fall by a huge 50-60 yuan.

### Seafood: Dried Shrimp Rebounds

The previous market for dried shrimp was sluggish, and the trend was very weak. For example, foreign mountain dried shrimp only sold for 105 yuan. However, in recent days, the arrival of goods has been scarce, and sales have gradually become active. Market sentiment has therefore turned optimistic. The current market is calling for a high price of 115 yuan. Next, Ningbo shrimp also requires 85 yuan, and Yantai goods are very scarce, calling for 100 yuan.

### Coal: Hongji Small Coal Shortage

Hongji No. 1 small white coal has recently entered the summer season, and the laundry business has developed, so sales have also turned prosperous. However, the original source of goods from the production area is extremely scarce, so prices are rising steadily. The market is calling for 220 yuan per ton for No. 1 small coal, exceeding the price of lump coal. No. 2 small coal is 210 yuan. The market price of screened small coal is 5-6 yuan cheaper.

### Dried Goods: Summer Orange Cakes Look Up

The previous arrival of Xiamen orange cakes was very limited, and good grades have been out of stock for a long time. It is found that 20 buckets were imported yesterday on a Sichuan ship. According to customer information, the cost is higher, and later the command will be issued, so the listed price is shouted to rise by 3-4 yuan, but it has not been traded. Judging from the market situation, it is bound to rise.

### A Study of the Manchurian Situation

Jilin is the old country of Manchuria, the land where the current dynasty prospered, and Ningguta is located there, which is the Jianzhou Right Guard of the Ming Dynasty. There are five tribes: Suksuhu River, Hun River, Wanyan, Suo E, and Zhe Chen. To the north of Manchuria are the four Zhilun tribes: Yehe, Hada, Huifa, and Ula. Only Ula is in Jilin, in northeastern Manchuria, while Huifa, Hada, and Yehe are all north of Xingjing, now under the jurisdiction of the Shengjing General, all named after the rivers they inhabit. The Ufa and Huifa rivers flow into the Songhua River, and the Hada and Yehe rivers flow into the Liao River, which is the Xihai Guard of the Ming Dynasty, also known as the North and South Passes. Hada is the South Pass and Yehe is the North Pass, both close to Kaiyuan and Tieling, which are the outer barriers of the Ming border. What is now governed by the Jilin General is the old city of Qianla, which is more than four miles from east to west, bordering the Yalu River and Tumen River in the south, and the Ula River and Songhua River in the north, up to the Hundong River, and the south bank is the lower reaches of the Heilongjiang River. To its east is the north side of Changbai Mountain. I once read the "A Study of the Origin of the Manchurian Clans," which said that the Norenbui tribe is located more than one hundred li northeast of Ningguta, residing on both banks of the Hulaha River and Songhua River, which is the Kuleha tribe. The Mulun tribe is located more than one thousand li east of Ningguta, residing on both banks of the Ussuri River. Two hundred li further east, the Naiya tribe and the Kala tribe reside near the source of the Renman River. These two tribes are the Woji tribe, all on the eastern route.

### The Romanian Playboy King

— Wen He

When it comes to the life story of Carol II, King of Romania, it's like a Hollywood palace film: both steamy and exciting, with lingering love and tense warfare. Even his appearance is so handsome and romantic that it would be perfectly suitable for him to star in this movie himself.

Don't think of him as a very autocratic monarch now; in his youth, he was also a socialist. He repeatedly declared that the monarchy was outdated, that he firmly believed in republicanism and embraced socialism. At that time, his great-uncle Carol I was on the throne, and seeing such a progressive young man in the royal family, he was greatly displeased and forcibly prevented him from studying, telling him to join the army.

This prince, who believed in socialism, was indeed thoroughly egalitarian. He fell in love with a commoner girl, Miss Zizi Lambrino. At that time, his father Ferdinand had already succeeded to the throne, but this King was muddleheaded and incompetent. His mother, Queen Marie (granddaughter of Queen Victoria of England), was more shrewd and capable, and she strongly opposed her son marrying a commoner. However, Crown Prince Carol was also a formidable figure, and he was very good at seizing opportunities. When the German army invaded Romania, and the Romanian royal family and the remnants of the defeated soldiers all fled to Russia, he saw his chance and boldly married Miss Zizi. At this time, everyone was a refugee, and although his elders opposed the marriage, they could do nothing about it. After marrying Zizi, he had a son.

His mother knew that it was useless to oppose him head-on; she understood that the best way to make a young man forget a woman was to introduce him to another. So she acted as a matchmaker and arranged for him to meet Princess Helen of Greece in Switzerland. This Princess Helen could be said to be one of the most beautiful golden branches and jade leaves of the European royal families at that time. The two later held a grand wedding in Athens. As a result, he had another son. But he found this life too boring.

It just so happened that a financier named Luo Jing had a daughter. She had light red hair and snow-white skin, not only was she enchantingly beautiful, but also exceptionally intelligent. She was the Madame Lupescu who would become famous all over the world. Carol fell in love with her again. She eventually became pregnant, and in order to give the child in her womb a nominal father, she married one of his guards. This child was Carol's third son.

Later, Madame Lupescu left Luo Jing and wandered all over Europe. Crown Prince Carol then decided once again to sacrifice his position and also left Luo Jing. The lovers met in Italy and later went to France and England.

Queen Marie really felt that there was no way to deal with this son. Romania stopped remitting money for him to use, hoping to make him realize his mistakes. However, Madame Lupescu's business skills were very high, and he cooperated with her to do business very smoothly. Through his dealings with Western European banks, he had long abandoned his socialist ideas from his youth. These years of commercial experience had turned Carol into a shrewd businessman, and he now even wanted to earn Hitler's money.

He lived intimately with Madame Lupescu and felt very happy, so he automatically announced his renunciation of the right of succession to the throne. They had money, friends, and freedom; who would still yearn for this dull court? Therefore, when the Romanian parliament later passed a law stipulating that he would never be able to succeed to the throne, he just laughed it off.

In 1927, Carol's father died, and Carol's six-year-old son Michael ascended the throne. The stubborn bureaucrats who had always opposed Carol actually formed a regency, wielding power and influence. Carol, seeing this situation abroad, felt very uncomfortable. One day in 1930, he suddenly took a plane back to China, which surprised the world. A few days later, he overthrew his own son's throne and crowned himself king.

Under these international circumstances, it is also difficult for him to be this king. However, he remembers that Romania was a victorious country in the last World War, and he will never let go of his spoils of war. Among the leaders of the small countries in Europe, he is probably Hitler's formidable opponent: he is as adventurous as Hitler, as greedy for power, and as fond of extraordinary life.

Hawthorne Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two "A Page of History!"

Ni Jinshou seemed unwilling to let go after having seized the opportunity to speak. He simply blocked the notepad and pen and continued to ask, "What did he come for?"

Jinmei said, "Naturally to look for Miss Wang. He was very angry when he heard that Miss Wang was not here. He seemed to want to make things difficult for her, and his appearance was very suspicious."

Hawthorne's eyes flickered, and he regained his speaking position, nodding repeatedly and saying, "Yes, yes, if he has something like that, then it is of course very suspicious. But we still have to get back to the subject and first find out the reason for the quarrel between Yu Gantang and your master. How did they quarrel?"

Although Hawthorne tried to bring the topic back to the harbor, it caused Jinmei to hesitate again. She paused before saying, "I don't know exactly why."

"Didn't you just say it was because of Zhao Boxiong?"

"That's... that's my guess."

"Okay, just say: Your guess is fine too."

She said haltingly, "That day—that is, the day that Elder Li came, Zhao Boxiong was talking to Miss Wang in this room. Young Master Yu suddenly came, and the two of them started arguing. Fortunately, Elder Li came down from upstairs and persuaded Young Master Yu to leave. Young Master Yu has not come since that day."

Hawthorne said, "Is this Young Master Yu fighting with Zhao Boxiong?"

"Yes."

"You just said he was arguing with Miss Wang."

"He quarreled with Zhao Boxiong first, and then he argued with Miss Wang."

"That's strange. Why?"

"Because... because Miss Wang seemed to be helping the Zhao surname speak. She also glanced at her dead master."

"Well, you must have heard what they said when they were arguing, right?"

"I don't know exactly... I wasn't nearby."

Hawthorne slowly dropped his cigarette butt into the silver ashtray on the round table. His eyes paused briefly when they passed over the two wine glasses on the table, as if admiring the pattern engraved on the glass.

He suddenly asked, "Does Young Master Yu drink alcohol too?"

Jinmei also looked up and glanced at the wine glasses on the table, shaking her head and saying, "He doesn't drink alcohol... But Zhao Boxiong does."

"Oh, how do you know?"

"I've often seen Zhao Boxiong drinking with Miss Wang." (34)

### A Family Visit to Gong Qiuxia

— Kai Zhuang

Gong Qiuxia, one of the Five Tiger Generals of the Plum Blossom Troupe in those years, and who recently performed in the film "Yanmen Pass", and her "husband" Hu Xinling, and his younger sister Hu Rongrong, are also "Three Heroes of a Family" in the film industry. Unexpectedly, yesterday the reporter visited a friend in Mingde Lane and happened to meet Hu Xinling, so he made a casual chat at his residence:

"Regarding Mr. Hu's previous directing life, please tell me something:"

"Speaking of directing life, I really dare not be it. It was in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934) when my father Shaoyu and a lawyer co-founded a culture film company. In that year of my childhood, I directed a "Parents and Children" film, starring Rongrong and Gong Qiuxia. The following year, Star Film Company asked someone to invite me, and I joined the Star Film Company's second factory. I worked with Ouyang Yuqian to direct "Qingming Festival". After the Star Film Company's second factory closed, I co-directed "New Year's Money" with Zhang Shichuan and Zheng Xiaoqiu in the first factory, starring Hu Rongrong.

Many people want to know a little about the history of your two's love. Can you publish a bit?" The reporter finished speaking, Miss Gong smiled, meaning to tell Hu Xinling not to say, but in the end he still told me a little. He said:

"Our acquaintance began when she belonged to the Plum Blossom Song and Dance Troupe. As for when she was in the Jian De Savings Association song and dance class, we were not acquainted yet." After speaking, Hu Rongrong took her schoolbag and came home.

"Rongrong hasn't filmed any movies recently, right?" the reporter asked.

"Yes, because the current trend of the film industry seems to be not very suitable for children to make movies, so a few film companies recently intended to invite Rongrong to make movies, but I declined them, letting her study hard for a while before talking about it."

"So Mr. Hu himself rarely cares about the film business, right?"

"Yes, I don't know why, but I seem to feel an unspeakable disappointment with today's film industry. My family has always believed in Christianity, so recently my interests have turned to Christianity, and I am currently writing several books about Christianity.

"But we are unwilling to give up on film art, especially since Qiuxia is still filming in Xinhua, but Rongrong's resumption of film life may have to be delayed for a period."

### Miss Yuan Meiyun's younger sister, Lingyun, is fifteen years old this year, and is intelligent by nature. She learned Qingyi at a young age and follows the Mei school. She has a beautiful appearance and excellent figure and voice. She is proficient in no less than fifty or sixty plays, especially the works of Huashan. Like Hua Tiancuo, Hong Ni Guan, Yutangchun, Ma Dian, Hong Xi and Universe Feng, etc., she is skilled in them. If she seeks further refinement in the future, her future is unlimited. The above picture is a still from her play.

### Impressions of "The Grapes of Wrath"

— Jun Tao

The struggle of hunger, the departure from the hometown, the threat of death, all of this is the sin of capitalist society. Because of the deepening of oppression, the trampled will revolt and be angry; and the reward for rebellion and anger is often wandering around the world... This is the general story of the film. It tries its best to expose the exploitation of the weak by capitalism and tries its best to criticize the ugly state, and that the profound description, the forceful rendering, can be said that this film is a head stick to capitalism, the cry of the working class!

The significance of the film is as mentioned above, and its style is particularly incompatible with the recent Hollywood-style works. Looking at the common characteristics, there are three points: (1) The entire film is composed of rough lines, with a strong Soviet film flavor. It also utilizes the effects of photography, lighting, and darkness to make the film beautiful and lovely. It is rare in recent films; (2) Because this film is faithful to John Steinbeck's original work, the entire film is about the long journey of the Tom family, and the various situations of joy, anger, sorrow, and joy. And the romance that is indispensable to general films is gone! (3) The director John Ford's style is similar to John M. Stahl. He gave up the stimulation of the climax and used delicate descriptions to run through the entire film, but there were tense performances everywhere. The dialogue is very heavy. If you don't understand it, then watching this film is a big loss.

There are many beautiful and wonderful scenes in the whole film. For example, the grandfather did not want to go to California, and the family tried to drug him and take him with them, and later died on the way. And the final mother and son parting, etc., all leave a deep impression. Generally speaking, the first half is better than the second half. And the primitiveness and emphasis of the picture make people excited!

Director John Ford is very good, and his technical methods are very sophisticated. The actor Henry Fonda's Tommy personality is very suitable, and his performance has reached perfection, but the inner pain cannot be expressed completely. Jane Darwell, who plays Kathy, is a successful actor. The rest, such as Jane Darwell, who plays the mother, and Charley Grapewin, who plays the grandfather, are all rare. In short, this film is a very meaningful film.

### Twenty Kinds of Ballads (13) Double Pearl Phoenix

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

"Falling Golden Fan" (Ballad No. 6) The plot is that "Miss Lu Qingyun lost a small mud-gilded fan, which was picked up by Zhou Xuewen; so he sold himself to learn to sing, returned the fan to ask for love, and finally fulfilled his wish." Now this "Double Pearl Phoenix" is a repetitive performance of such a story. However, the pearl phoenix replaced the golden fan, and Zhou Xuewen and Lu Qingyun in "Falling Golden Fan" are Wen Bizheng and Huo Dingjin here.

After Wen Bizheng sold himself into the Huo mansion, he could not enter the boudoir of the young lady; the corner of the red building was close at hand! Fortunately, on the birthday of Huo Tianguan, he was ordered to send flowers, so he was lucky enough to realize his expectations. This section "Sending Flowers to the Building" is what the ballad singers who sing "Double Pearl Phoenix" call the "Guan Zishu".

In the past era of "polygamy", "romantic talents" of course could not be satisfied with one wife. Therefore, the author made Wen Bizheng occupy Dingjin, the autumn flowers, a pair of masters and servants, and even pulled Ni Afeng to be the guests. She also felt not lively enough, but also spared a Li Zhufeng.

The ornament lost by Huo Dingjin is "Pearl Phoenix", and Miss Li's boudoir name also calls "Pearl Phoenix", which is the so-called "Double Pearl Phoenix".
