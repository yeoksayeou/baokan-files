Editorial

### The Balkans in the European War

After the cessation of hostilities and reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Finland, the world's attention has once again focused and shifted to the Balkans. The Balkan Peninsula is located in southeastern Europe, bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Numerous ethnic groups stand side by side, each governing itself, and because of historical grievances, they remain at odds with each other to this day. In addition, ambitious countries surround them on all sides, vying for control, attempting to manipulate them, and engaging in cunning and deceit. Therefore, those with insight view it as a dangerous and explosive powder keg. During the period from 1912 to 1913, the countries of the peninsula were filled with pessimistic separation and division, leading to two Balkan wars. The fuse for the last European war was also located there. Although there has been no exchange of fire in the past twenty years, a diplomatic and economic war is unfolding throughout the peninsula. Examining its background and inferring its impact is closely related to the various countries of Europe.

The Balkan Peninsula is rich in resources, so it is coveted by the great powers, and Germany considers it to be the most important raw material storage area. In total, the surplus food and various raw materials can supply half of Germany's imports. This was true in peacetime, let alone in the current war period. Germany needs the supply of food and raw materials from the Balkan countries to counter the economic blockade of Britain and France. Originally, although Germany is known as a powerful country, its economic resources are actually among the poorest. According to Nazi Germany's plan, the rich resources of the Balkans, such as grains, oils, tobacco, timber, steel, manganese, and aluminum, should be developed on a large scale and preferentially supplied to meet the needs of German industry and economy. However, Germany actually faces many obstacles in this peninsula, making it difficult to control everything as it wishes. During this wartime, due to geographical and military restrictions, there are many difficulties in transportation and transshipment. Although Germany has obtained many conveniences directly and indirectly after making friends with the Soviet Union, the situation between Germany and the Soviet Union is different. Because the Soviet Union's domestic production of steel, oil, wheat, and other products is sufficient for its own needs, there is no need for supplies from the Balkans. Therefore, the Soviet Union and the Balkan countries only need to maintain their emotional and traditional ties. Especially for the Slavic peoples of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, it is easier to develop close feelings. Therefore, Bulgaria and South Korea seem to be naturally inclined to the Soviet Union. Germany is different. To put it simply, Germany's concern for the Balkans is mainly based on economic interests, while the Soviet Union's is mainly based on political emotions. Because of the difference in these interests, there is currently the possibility of close cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Balkans. This close cooperation in one area will be a major factor in the evolution of the European situation in the future.

As for Italy's involvement in the Balkans, it seems similar to Germany's. Being close by, it is easy to obtain large supplies of raw materials and it can also serve as an important strategic stronghold to protect its weak Adriatic coastline and its transportation lines with East African territories. Therefore, the policy adopted by Italy in the Balkans is to form a political group as Italy's external defense for European international affairs, and at the same time form an economic group to resist various external economic offensives. However, to date, Italy's achievements in this area are still quite meager and empty. Recently, the leaders of Germany and Italy met in the Brenner Pass. The main topic was naturally the global situation, but it is said that Hitler strongly urged the Italian Prime Minister to get closer to the Soviet Union and clearly provided guarantees, indicating that the Soviet Union would never extend its power to the Balkan Peninsula to avoid threatening Italy. This rumor is difficult to confirm, but there is no need for any other proof that the German side has this desire. However, after investigating the causes and consequences, the Soviet Union also has its demands in the Balkans, such as demanding the return of Bessarabia from Romania. To this day, there is no evidence that the Soviet Union has given up. Even in the case of Germany and Italy, even if there is no question of their attitude towards the Soviet Union obstructing them, the political and economic contradictions between the two countries in the Balkans are also undeniable. Therefore, there are fundamental questions about whether Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union can truly be harmonious in the Balkans. At most, they can only temporarily achieve an adjustment. Furthermore, Britain and France view the Balkans as the most suitable place for investment. For example, Romania's oil, Romania and Yugoslavia's steel, and Yugoslavia and Hungary's aluminum mines are mostly developed using capital from Britain and France. Where investment interests lie, how can they sit back and watch them disappear? Moreover, does the result of their disappearance mean aiding the enemy? Furthermore, the rise and fall of power on the Balkan Peninsula directly affects the safety of Britain and France in the Mediterranean. This is the lifeline of Britain and France. How can they allow it to be cut off?

In summary, the situation in the Balkans is extremely complex. Germany, Italy, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, to varying degrees, all view the friendship and enmity of the countries of the Balkan Peninsula as the key to their safety, danger, good fortune, misfortune, benefit, harm, glory, and ruin. The main cause of the First European War was here, but it failed to achieve a thorough and fair solution. The current European war is not ostensibly for the Balkans, but the final focus may still be the Balkans as its destination. Regardless of who wins or loses, whether or not their territories are damaged or benefited, and whether or not the political views of both sides are judged as right and wrong by the war, the Balkan forces will be the result of this European war. It will create a new hegemony, or that will be the only product of this war! As far as the current situation is concerned, it is not uncommon for the Western European war to be boring and suddenly turn the Balkans into a decisive battlefield!

### Arita Claims in the House of Representatives that Japan-U.S. Relations are Worsening; Negotiations with the Soviet Union Have Also Made No Progress; Chongqing Newspaper Urges the U.S., Soviet Union, and Great Britain to Cooperate Effectively and Sanction Japanese Aggression in the Far East

Tokyo: Today's Budget Committee of the House of Representatives convened at 10:22 a.m. Mr. Kasai Shigeharu (first) and the Foreign Minister held the following question-and-answer session regarding the issues between Japan and the United States and the Japan-Soviet oil agreement: Mr. Kasai Shigeharu asked: "The 'Holy War' has reached its fourth year. Today, when the prospect of handling the incident is still distant, the responsibilities of the diplomatic authorities are even greater. For the past thirty years, Japan has often been let down by the United States. Since the abolition of the Japan-U.S. Treaty of Commerce last year, Japan's diplomacy towards the United States during the incident has been a complete failure. Relations between Japan and the United States, such as the modification of the Treaty of Commerce and American interests in China, have reached their worst state. In my opinion, there is no other way to open up the current situation and make the American public understand Japan's true intentions. What is your opinion?" The Foreign Minister replied: "Japan-U.S. relations have recently deteriorated further. However, I believe that there is still room for opening up relations between Japan and the United States. The government is also taking various measures for this purpose, but I cannot explain it here. The deterioration of Japan-U.S. relations cannot be said to be entirely the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is because the United States does not understand Japan's true intentions. Therefore, the government is working hard to make the United States understand. It is regrettable that the United States has not yet fully understood Japan's true intentions. From the perspective of the traditional national relations between the United States and China, it is quite difficult for the United States to understand Japan's position. However, the Japanese government is still striving to seek its perfection." Kasai asked: "Does the Foreign Minister have any prospects for the Japan-Soviet oil agreement, etc.?" The Foreign Minister replied: "The government hopes that many pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union must be resolved to adjust the national bites of the two countries. The government is currently negotiating on various pending issues, but it has not reached a compromise." (Domei News Agency, 23rd dispatch)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita, when attending a budget meeting of the Lower House yesterday, rejected a suggestion by legislator Miyake that Japan strengthen the Rome-Berlin Axis "to prevent Britain from exerting pressure on East Asia in case it wins the war." According to Miyake, "Japan must abandon its non-joining policy and join the Axis countries to help establish a new order in Europe and a new world order." He pointed out that during the First World War, after Britain won the victory, it exerted pressure on Japan and the Far East. He predicted that this situation would happen again, and that the United States would help Britain to restrain Japan. Miyake criticized Japan for being too close to Britain and France at present. Arita replied, "Japan's non-joining policy cannot be changed, and there is no need to change it at present." (United Press, 23rd dispatch)

Washington: Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita issued a statement yesterday, stating that the Japanese government is not willing to strengthen relations with Germany and Italy. Diplomatic officials here felt quite surprised when they heard about it, and said that if Japan strengthens relations with Germany and Italy, even if it does not have a substantial impact on the friendly relations between the United States and Japan, it will at least have a psychological impact. In addition, American public opinion has always been in favor of Britain and France, and it remains so. If Japan gets closer to Germany, the difficulties between the United States and Japan will inevitably increase, and the United States will find it even more difficult to consider the issue of concluding a new trade agreement between the United States and Japan. (Havas, 23rd dispatch)

Chongqing: The Chinese Army's official newspaper, Saodang Bao, argued in today's editorial that the United States and the Soviet Union should cooperate effectively in the Far East to make Japan's aggression collapse as soon as possible. According to the editorial, "The countries in the Pacific region, apart from China and Japan, should be the United States and the Soviet Union. As for Britain and France, they are now both involved in Europe, so in terms of sanctioning Japan's aggression, their position is not important. In other words, in the current environment, the most effective way to end Japanese aggression is none other than the cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. It is a pity that the United States still cannot be without hatred towards the Soviet Union. It must be known that if the United States continues to harbor unhappiness towards the Soviet Union, it will allow Japan to continue to expand its aggressive actions in China. What Japan is currently praying for most is that both the United States and the Soviet Union cooperate with Japan. Japan is now working hard on this, hoping that both the United States and the Soviet Union will enter its trap. We hope that the peace-loving people of the United States and the Soviet Union will no longer be manipulated by the Japanese." (United Press, 23rd dispatch)

Chongqing: This morning, the Central Daily News published an article titled "British Policy Toward the Soviet Union," urging the British and Soviet governments to cooperate closely. It said that British Foreign Minister Halifax's remarks in the House of Lords on March 19, stating that the British government would not take any measures that would harm British-Soviet relations, were very important. The newspaper continued, "It is regrettable that Britain and the Soviet Union cannot maintain close cooperation. The failure of the two countries to cooperate is not only a serious loss for Europe, but the world is also affected. The current European situation is entirely caused by the lack of cooperation among democratic countries. At the same time, the lack of cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union not only harms the two countries themselves, but also undermines the power of various democratic countries to promote world peace. Britain and the Soviet Union are both our friends. We hope that British-Soviet cooperation will promote peace in Europe and the failure of aggressors." (Reuters, 23rd dispatch)

Young's wife told reporters from the United Press last night that she and her husband were "extremely satisfied with the verdict. We plan to stay in Japan indefinitely."

### Hull Refuses to Run for U.S. President

Washington - A reporter recently learned from friends of Secretary of State Hull that Hull has no intention of seeking the presidency and will refuse if the Democratic Party nominates him as a presidential candidate. According to these friends, who knew that President Roosevelt fully supported Hull, they had urged Hull to run. However, Hull declined, citing numerous sufficient reasons for not doing so. It is said that when they initially inquired, Hull jokingly replied that he was not yet aware of his eligibility as a candidate. Furthermore, according to sources within the New Deal faction, once Hull's proposed reciprocal trade agreement expansion is put to a vote in the Senate, the calls for Hull to run for president will disappear. This aligns with the aforementioned news that Hull does not wish to be a Democratic candidate. As for Hull's proposal, it has passed the House, and the Senate debate is scheduled to begin next Monday. The reporter also learned that the New Deal faction is deeply concerned about the growing sentiment against a third term and has drafted a plan to nominate Attorney General Jackson as the Democratic candidate if Roosevelt also refuses to run.

### British Consulate Staff Threatened in Zhangde: Demonstrators in Anti-British Movement Storm Hotel; British Embassy Protests to Japan

Peiping - It has been learned from an independent source that a member of the British consulate and two Canadian missionaries were threatened by anti-British demonstrators in Zhangde, Henan Province. The church's property in Zhangde had been burned and looted. The British Vice-Consul in Peiping, Luo Bainai, along with the two missionaries, obtained passes from the Japanese military authorities through the Japanese Embassy in Peiping and traveled to Zhangde to inspect the situation. They arrived in Zhangde on March 18 and were arranged by the city authorities to stay in a Japanese-owned hotel. At the time, the city was calm, with no signs of anti-British sentiment. However, while they were dining, they suddenly heard a commotion outside and shouts of "Down with Britain" and "Where are the British?". About 30 people then stormed into the hotel and entered the British dining room. Two Chinese men, one holding a bamboo pole and the other a wooden stick with a knife at the end, stood directly in front of the British, performing a war-like dance before attacking the British Vice-Consul and the missionary, Mr. Jin. Fortunately, none of them were seriously injured. At this time, Japanese military police arrived and dispersed the demonstrators. It is reported that the British Embassy has protested to the Japanese Embassy, criticizing the lack of protection for the British and demanding the punishment of the culprits.

In terms of education, universities and primary and secondary schools will be added under the administrative control of Chongqing. It is said that the plan is to add more than ten universities.

### Romania Consolidates Military Strength, Resolves to Defend Its Territory; Overseas Trade Policy Faces Difficult Choices; Fierce Competition Between Britain and Germany; Germany Denies Sending Severe Note to Romania

Bucharest - King Carol of Romania, in an address to a delegation of British parliamentarians, emphatically stated that Romania is determined to defend its borders with all its might, and all national activities are primarily focused on equipping the army. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Bucharest - Representatives of the Romanian Senate met with the King and presented a document of the Senate's response to the King's decree. The King instructed the representatives that other matters could be delayed, but the urgent task was to revitalize the military. To maintain national unity and integrity, sacrifices must be prepared. He was pleased that the Senate could loyally support the court's foreign policy guidelines. He also found it gratifying that the relations between Romania and the Balkan allies were becoming closer, and that Italy and Bulgaria expressed friendship and sympathy towards Romania. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Bucharest - According to sources close to the German Embassy here, Germany has sent a strongly worded note to the Romanian government, stating that Germany cannot tolerate the frequent changes in Romania's foreign trade regulations and its handling of foreign currency. Germany strongly criticized the measures adopted by Romania several weeks ago. It is said that the Romanian government of Tatarescu will resign due to this note. It is rumored that Germany hopes that the new cabinet will be formed by Mr. Fanda. Fanda has served as Prime Minister several times and recently served as the leader of the National Renaissance Front. Before sending this note, Germany had made several new demands to the Romanian government, including raising the exchange rate between the German and Romanian currencies and lowering the prices of Romanian exports. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

Bucharest - Yesterday, Reuters disseminated rumors that the German ambassador to Romania was engaged in serious negotiations with the Romanian government. The German embassy in Romania firmly denied this, stating that the German side had not sent a strongly worded note to the Romanian government. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Bucharest - Senior officials of the Romanian Foreign Ministry solemnly denied the news released by Reuters that the German ambassador to Romania had taken action against the Romanian government. It is claimed that the German ambassador to Romania, Fabricius, and the leader of the German economic delegation currently negotiating in Bucharest, Clodius, have not taken any steps against the Romanian government, nor have they presented any ultimatum-like notes. The general impression here is that the purpose of Reuters' dissemination of this news is to obstruct the progress of German-Romanian economic negotiations and to disturb German-Romanian friendly relations. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

### Germany and Romania Conduct Economic Negotiations; Romania to Send Delegation to London to Negotiate Revision of Bilateral Clearing Agreement

Capital of Romania - The claim that the German Embassy presented a "Dear Note" to the Romanian government has been firmly denied by official circles. According to well-informed sources, the Director of Economic Affairs of the German Foreign Ministry, Clodius, has begun negotiations with the Romanian authorities in the past two days. German propaganda personnel are taking the opportunity to spread the above rumors in the hope of confusing the public. In reality, the relationship between Germany and Romania is not like this. Since Clodius arrived here, he has felt that the situation is very unfavorable to Germany, so he is only using diplomatic tactics and dare not act hastily, lest the situation worsen. Take oil as an example. Germany should have received 180,000 tons from Romania every month, but due to the obstruction of navigation on the Danube River, it only received half of that. Britain and France not only purchased all of the amount they were entitled to, but also took the portion left by Germany. As of the 31st, Romanian oil exports totaled 1.38 million tons, of which Germany obtained only 385,000 tons, while Britain and France jointly had 605,000 tons. The remaining 390,000 tons were purchased by Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia. Romania still has a portion reserved for Italy. In addition, Romania was supposed to sell a large amount of miscellaneous grains to Germany, but most of it is stockpiled along the lower reaches of the Danube River. Due to the lack of transportation, it is impossible to transport it to Germany. The oilseeds that Romania was supposed to sell to Germany have not been fully purchased by Germany and will have to wait until after the autumn harvest to continue purchasing. At present, the items that Germany purchases from Romania can be expected to increase by a certain amount, but only timber and livestock. Due to these various reasons, Clodius deeply feels that Britain and France have been passive in Romania's early harvest in recent months. If Germany acts too hastily, it will backfire. As far as I can tell, Clodius's mission is nothing more than two things: (1) to study whether the current payment methods between Germany and Romania can be extended to the protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia; (2) to investigate the scope of Romania's new foreign trade system and how it can affect the payment methods between Germany and Romania. At the same time, he also hopes to revise the exchange rate of the German mark and the Czech koruna against the Romanian currency. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Bucharest - Romania will send an economic delegation to London in the near future to negotiate a revision of the bilateral clearing agreement. Since the outbreak of the war, British industry has undergone many changes to meet the needs of the war. The items that Romania can purchase in the British market have been greatly reduced, so Romania is eager to revise the bilateral clearing agreement. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

### Key Points of the Italian-Romanian Trade Agreement: Cotton Exchanged for Oil

Bucharest - The recently signed trade agreement between Italy and Romania is valid until the end of this year. Italy will purchase 450,000 tons of oil from Romania this year. The quantity discussed by private shops is not subject to this restriction. Last year, Italy purchased three times more oil from Romania than this year. Italy will mainly exchange cotton. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

### Berlin Officials Confirm Soviet Foreign Minister to Visit Germany, One Saying He Has Already Arrived in Berlin

Paris - According to sources in Helsinki, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, accompanied by several foreign and military advisors, has arrived in Berlin and is preparing to stay for two days. However, according to sources in Moscow, German officials there do not believe that Molotov has made this trip. The two sources contradict each other, and whether Molotov is currently staying in Berlin has become a mystery. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin - At a reception for foreign journalists today, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declined to give a direct answer to the question of whether Molotov would visit Berlin, saying only, "You should all enjoy the Easter holidays and not meddle in politics." The spokesman then denied rumors that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had left Berlin. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Berlin - According to senior officials of the National Socialist Party here today, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov will not come to Germany today, nor during the Easter holidays. However, they did not deny the possibility of Molotov coming to Germany after Easter. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)

Brussels - According to newspapers here, German diplomacy is unusually active, and an important political event is about to occur. People from all countries should recognize that the German-Italian-Soviet agreement, and even the Soviet-Turkish non-aggression treaty, are likely to materialize. The Leaks Party's newspaper "Le Lier" stated that only simple-minded people believe that Italy is beneficial to joining the Allied Powers. Currently, Italy is assisting Germany in all aspects without giving the Allied Powers an excuse to interfere. Once the time is ripe, Italy will strike the Western European democracies with fresh forces and achieve its goals. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Rome - It is rumored that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov will visit Berlin in a short time, and that Foreign Minister Ciano will also go to Berlin to meet with Molotov. Responsible people here have neither denied nor confirmed this rumor. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### German and Italian Diplomatic Activities in the Balkans; Division of Spheres of Influence; Both Sides Compete for Supremacy

Paris - According to news from the capital of Yugoslavia, the Italian government has sent many representatives to engage in activities in various Balkan countries, in order to promote public opinion in those countries to sympathize with Italy. At the same time, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is expected to visit the capital of Yugoslavia in the near future. This shows that Germany and Italy still have the intention of competing for supremacy in the division of spheres of influence in the Balkans. For this reason, although Berlin has said that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union are about to issue a joint declaration to maintain the status quo in the Balkans, in reality, each country still dreams different dreams. Before taking any joint action, they are all trying to consolidate their own position as much as possible. In addition, Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki is currently visiting Rome. The goal is to inquire about what kind of assistance Italy can give to Hungary. Back in late November of last year, the Italian government made a promise to Hungary, saying that it was willing to assist the country in resisting Soviet attacks. At that time, Hungary and Romania reached some kind of understanding because of Italy's promise. At this point, Germany is doing its best to deal with Romania, hoping to obtain sufficient supplies from that country, so that Italy's efforts in the Balkans, that is, the efforts that once eased the situation there, have been greatly hindered. As a result, it had to change its course and compete with Germany. In short, Italy used to be responsible for promoting the establishment of a joint defense group in the Balkans. Now, it has changed its original attitude and confronted Germany and the Soviet Union, trying to choose the small countries it favors and place them under its direct control. As a result, the Balkans have become a place where Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union are secretly competing. Therefore, it is no wonder that the small countries of the peninsula are uneasy. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

### Hungarian Prime Minister Arrives in Rome

Rome - Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki arrived in Rome today. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano welcomed him at the station. After getting off the train, Teleki immediately drove to the Hungarian Embassy to rest. It is reported that Teleki's visit to Italy, although of a private nature, will include meetings with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, as well as an audience with the King and the Pope.

### Reports of Conflict Between Australian Troops and Arabs Are German Propaganda

London - Reuters has learned that reports from German radio stations that conflicts have occurred between Australian troops and Arabs near Jerusalem and Jaffa are completely untrue. Australian troops have excellent discipline and have very good relations with the Arabs. German radio has talked about the atrocities of Australian soldiers, which aroused the anger of the Arabs, and that the British authorities sentenced the Australian soldiers to death to appease the people. In fact, as far as London knows, no Australian soldiers have been sentenced to death by military tribunals. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

### Near East Military Situation

The war on the Western Front of Europe has fallen into a stalemate. Consequently, many military experts are predicting that the war will not only affect the Balkan Peninsula but also spread to the Near East. The possibility of clashes between German and Soviet troops and Allied forces somewhere on the Iranian border plateau, or in the Kurdistan region on the Turkish-Iranian border, or in the mountainous areas on the Soviet Armenian border, is being increasingly rumored. There are also rumors that the Soviet Union intends to attack Afghanistan and the oil fields of Iraq. French General Weygand has also inspected the Turkish border defenses and plans to land troops in Thessaloniki, Greece, or along the Black Sea coast. However, those who expect war to break out soon in the Balkans or the Near East seem unaware of the many difficulties involved in conducting any military operations in these areas. When the reporter discussed this issue with military and diplomatic observers, they all said that conflict in the Balkans is possible, but an Allied invasion of Baku in the extreme south of the Soviet Union or a Soviet Red Army attack on Mosul in northern Iraq is highly unlikely. How the situation in that region will develop in the future will depend on how the war in Western Europe progresses. It is not possible to make predictions too far into the future at this time.

When people generally discuss the military situation in the Near East, they focus on General Weygand's forces stationed in Syria and the support provided by British troops in Palestine and Egypt. There are many strange rumors circulating about the troops under General Weygand. According to reliable sources, the troops in that region total 150,000, all well-trained and well-equipped. If necessary, reinforcements of one or two times that number can, of course, be transferred from French Africa and British India. (Editor's note: According to recent news from Paris, France has concentrated 275,000 troops in the Near East. Meanwhile, a London dispatch also stated that the Allied forces have concentrated 500,000 troops in the Near East. This dispatch was censored by British inspectors.)

With such a large force stationed in the Near East, the Allied forces can be said to have taken preemptive action, deterring Germany and the Soviet Union from acting rashly. If Germany and the Soviet Union attempt to take action in the Balkans or advance towards Iraq, this French force can serve as the basic force in the Near East. The commander-in-chief is General Weygand, a veteran who assisted Marshal Foch in the last European war.

It is generally acknowledged that the future of the Balkans rests on Hitler alone. It is obviously in Hitler's interest to take the Balkans without a fight. If Germany feels a shortage of raw materials this spring or summer, it will inevitably resort to force in the Balkans, and then it will be unavoidable for the Allied forces to contend with them.

However, according to military observers, during the last Great War, it took the Allied forces a long time to deploy their land lines in the Near East. As for the German army, it may be able to invade Romania and northern Yugoslavia within a few weeks, and then, with the aid of the Allied forces, the armies of the Balkan countries will engage in a real bloody battle with the German army in southern Yugoslavia and the mountains of Greece.

This development is possible. Judging from the current situation, the economic war will continue to intensify in the Balkans, gradually brewing into a situation of armed conflict. Of course, Hitler's unpredictable psychology may change the evolution of this situation. In any case, Italy is bound to occupy a position in the Balkan Peninsula. The country opposes both the Allied landing in that region and the German invasion of Yugoslavia, even if they do not invade Romania.

As for the Allied invasion of Baku and the Soviet Red Army's invasion of Mosul, it is generally considered to be a long way off. The borders between Turkey and the Soviet Union and the northern region of Iran present insurmountable difficulties for modern mechanized forces. However, according to military experts, if the war drags on, the Near East will inevitably become a battlefield. In the last Great War, the outcome was decided on the Western Front. Now that both the French Maginot Line and the German Siegfried Line cannot be easily broken through, this European war may be decided in the Near East. (Translated from the New York Herald Tribune)

### French Chamber of Deputies Voted Yesterday: Reynaud Cabinet Barely Avoided Defeat; Over a Hundred Abstentions, Confidence Vote Barely Passed; Prime Minister Encourages All Factions to Unite and Share the Difficult Task

Paris: The French Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the new cabinet yesterday with 268 votes against 156, and adjourned until April 2. This vote of confidence only achieved a majority of 112 votes, with as many as 110 abstentions. Although the Reynaud cabinet encountered this setback, it will remain in office. According to observers, the reason why the new government received so few votes is that the public expected the creation of a powerful cabinet dedicated to achieving victory with all its strength, but Reynaud created a government based on the old-style party platform. Although it recruited members from various parties, making it broader than the Daladier cabinet, it is not a truly coalition government of all parties. Moreover, the right-wing factions are deeply dissatisfied with the inclusion of the Socialist Party. The plan to organize a wartime cabinet is welcomed, but the fact that the cabinet members have increased from 27 to 35 is inconsistent with the demands of the newspapers and the public for a smaller and more efficient cabinet. (Reuter dispatch, 22nd)

Paris: After the Chamber of Deputies passed the vote of confidence in the government, the cabinet immediately held a cabinet meeting and decided to continue serving with difficulty. Afterwards, some cabinet members told the press that all misunderstandings between the current cabinet and the Radical Socialist Party have been eliminated, and they will definitely be able to cooperate in the future. According to an official communiqué, "The cabinet held a meeting at the Ministry of Finance, chaired by Prime Minister Reynaud, to study the situation after the Chamber of Deputies passed the vote of confidence in the government. All cabinet members expressed their sincerity to Prime Minister Reynaud and decided to cooperate sincerely. Under these circumstances, Prime Minister Reynaud believes that since the cabinet has obtained an absolute majority in the Chamber of Deputies, it should continue to serve with difficulty. In addition, the cabinet's war affairs meeting is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow morning." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Cabinet War Committee Holds First Meeting; Composed of Nine Cabinet Members; Gamelin Also Attends

Paris: The Cabinet War Committee held its first meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 this morning, chaired by Prime Minister Reynaud. The attendees included Cabinet Assistant Hédan, Minister of National Defense and Army Daladier, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac, Minister of Colonies Mandel, Minister of Finance Lamoureux, Minister of Blockade Monnet, Minister of Armaments Tautée, and General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 noon. Before attending the meeting, Daladier had a long conversation with General Gamelin. In addition, the newly appointed cabinet ministers have all taken office in their respective ministries. Among them, Minister of Propaganda Frossard and Minister Delegate Février, after taking office, immediately ordered the establishment of the Supreme Propaganda Committee within the ministry and appointed Giraudoux as chairman. Giraudoux is a famous playwright and was originally the director of the Information Bureau. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

### Reynaud Clarifies Diplomatic Principles: Reciprocity of Friendship; Hostility in Response to Hostility

Paris: After Prime Minister Reynaud read the policy statement of the cabinet in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, the president of the Radical Socialist Party, Chalamel, and Bastid, spoke in succession, expressing dissatisfaction with the excessive number of ministers and delegates in the cabinet and the participation of members of the Socialist Party in the cabinet. Then, Marrain, the leader of the right-wing Republican Democratic Union, spoke, saying that since the new cabinet is neither a wartime cabinet nor a cabinet of national unity, the members of his party will unanimously vote against it. Prime Minister Reynaud then took the podium again and delivered a speech in response. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Paris: Before the vote in the Chamber of Deputies, Prime Minister Reynaud replied to the debate, briefly stating that national security used to rely on the army, but today it relies on the entire nation. The mistakes made in the last war must not be repeated now. Prime Minister Daladier has demonstrated his ability in cherishing life (the audience applauded). The responsibility we bear for the country now is to develop weapons most suitable for the new era. Regarding foreign policy, I can abide by the declaration made by Daladier in the secret meeting of the Chamber of Deputies. During the time of the war, it is a crime to allow individual biases to be brought into politics. Therefore, what has been thought and said in the past must not be taken into account (this implicitly refers to the right wing's objections to the inclusion of Socialist Party member Monnet in the new cabinet). The only policy of our foreign policy is to treat friends as friends and enemies as enemies (the audience applauded). The cabinet's declaration is sincere, and we must not disregard any efforts to make the workers understand why we are resisting communism, not because it embraces extreme left-wing teachings, but because we want to eradicate treasonous organizations. The Communist Party has conspired against the country, so we must destroy it (the audience applauded). Freedom is the most precious tradition of France. We are now in the camp of freedom with Britain. We welcome other countries to join the Franco-British group. The compromise and unity of France and Britain do not erase the significance of our Latin national unity. Reynaud continued that he had informed Daladier that he wished to form a new cabinet with his support, and Daladier finally gave his support. Reynaud responded to the criticism of recruiting members of the Socialist Party into the cabinet, saying that the loyalty of the members of the Socialist Party to the country is well known. Today, it is imperative to get the help of all political parties, especially the largest political party in the Chamber of Deputies, in order to solve the war problem. Some have pointed out that the number of cabinet members is excessive. Reynaud said that when ministers are overwhelmed with official duties, their subordinates often act on their behalf. Before the vote, Reynaud concluded his speech, saying that the aim of our foreign policy is to create a new Europe of free nations. The problem of spiritual strength is now as important as the problem of material strength. Our people have been too slow to respond to events. We must promote France to France. If the Chamber of Deputies allows it, the new government will be excited and invigorated to shoulder the difficult task. Our will to fight is to win the only possible lasting peace with the least possible delay. You are about to vote now, which will place a great responsibility on all foreign countries. This war is really putting democracy to the test. We will grit our teeth and seek victory and nothing less, and firmly believe that victory will belong to us.

Then Lebrun rose to speak, saying that the Socialist Party's joining the new cabinet was not prearranged with Reynaud in advance. The reason why the Socialist Party cooperates with the new cabinet is to serve the country with selfless and loyal spirit, and to obtain a just and lasting peace in the shortest possible time with the least possible sacrifice.

The new Prime Minister Reynaud narrowly avoided defeat in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, but he was not discouraged by it. He has now convened the new War Committee, equivalent to an inner cabinet, to schedule a meeting tomorrow morning in order to encourage France to make greater efforts to fight the war and win victory. Reynaud will now take a ten-day break to wait for Congress to reconvene after the recess, so that he can consolidate his position. The majority of the political circles welcome the government's decision to remain in office. It is generally felt that the fact that many Radical Party members abstained from voting when expressing confidence in the government's motion yesterday is quite puzzling, because the most famous leaders of the Radical Party, such as Daladier, have accepted positions in the new government, so it is difficult to believe that the party is opposed to the government. It is now generally believed that Reynaud's decision to forge ahead and face everything will result in gaining the support of the majority. An analysis of yesterday's vote in the Chamber of Deputies shows that out of 109 Radical Party members, a total of 10 voted against the government, including the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Mistre. 48 abstained, and 2 party members were absent. Therefore, the actual number of votes in favor of the government was 49. It is found that the Radical Party has a total of 10 ministers and 1 delegate in the new government, with 1 delegate. The new government has a total of 22 ministers and 13 undersecretaries. (Reuter dispatch, 22nd)

### French Military Budget for the Second Quarter of This Year Passed by Both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies

### British Cabinet Preparing for Reshuffle; Labour Party May Participate

London: According to informed sources, Prime Minister Chamberlain will take advantage of the Easter holiday to discuss the cabinet reshuffle with trusted cabinet members. Members of Parliament are watching the development of the French political situation with great interest. The British government previously tried to strengthen the foundation of the majority party and will determine whether the inclusion of the French Socialist Party in the cabinet is effective. The British Labour Party has always adhered to the decision of the Executive Committee and refused to participate in the cabinet. If the cabinet is indeed reshuffled in the future, it may be possible for the Labour Party to participate. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

### Amidst Tensions in Europe, Italian Army Reorganized; Increase in Officers and Soldiers; Military Strength in Capital Area Doubled

Rome: Today is the 21st anniversary of the Fascist movement. The Fascist Supreme Council passed a bill to reorganize the army, stipulating that the country shall have one General Staff Headquarters, one Army, 21 Corps, and the Alpine Army, with a total of 35 commanders and 96 division commanders. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Rome: According to the draft army organization bill currently submitted to the Senate, the Italian army in the capital area will increase from 13 to 18 corps, and six military districts will be established, including Zara on the Adriatic Sea and Elba in the Mediterranean Sea.

(Reuter dispatch, 23rd)

Rome: The number of Italian army officers and soldiers has recently been increased due to the serious international situation. The detailed plan is being studied by the Military Committee of the Fascist Professional Organization Parliament. The main points stipulate that under the Chief of the General Staff, six group army commanders will be established (there were only five last year), 28 military districts will be controlled, and 18 infantry corps, totaling 54 divisions (last year there were 17 corps, totaling 51 divisions), one motorized unit corps, totaling two divisions, one armored vehicle corps, totaling three divisions, one light unit corps, totaling three divisions, and five mountain units divisions, for a total of 67 divisions, 5,317 artillery officers, and 10,684 infantry officers. In addition, separate commanders will be established for the garrisons in the Zara area (on the coast of Yugoslavia) and the island of Elba. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)

### Hanko Island Transferred to the Soviet Union; All Residents Evacuated

Helsinki: Yesterday, 20 Soviet officials arrived in Hanko Island by plane to prepare to receive the area ceded to the Soviet Union according to the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. Finnish border committee officials met with them and inspected the situation on the peninsula together. An official report stated that the officials sent by the Soviet Union hoped that the area would be gradually handed over. They are currently hoping that Finland will continue to supply water, electricity, and food. The official transfer will begin at midnight today. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)

Helsinki: The deadline for Finland to hand over Hanko Island to the Soviet Union expired yesterday. Swedish buses and trucks also assisted in the evacuation of the residents of Hanko. It is said that a total of 500 Swedish vehicles helped the Finnish people evacuate from the areas ceded to the Soviet Union. General Mannerheim also had a house located near Hanko, which was also in the ceded area. He has telegraphed the mayor of Hanko to convey to the citizens not to abandon hope for a bright future. The highway from eastern Finland to the west is filled with long lines of vehicles, but the order is very good. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)

Helsinki: The Finnish government has prepared for the resettlement of the people who withdrew from the ceded areas. 106,000 migrants have arrived in Abo and will be temporarily housed in schools. A large number of migrants will continue to arrive in the near future. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)

### Britain and France Order Large Number of Airplanes from the United States; 2,000 Aircraft Expected to Be Sold

New York: The New York Times reported a Washington dispatch stating that, according to officials participating in the U.S. Army Department meetings, a plan to enable Britain and France to obtain approximately 2,000 new-style aircraft is nearing completion. These aircraft were all ordered by the U.S. Army. It is heard that a decision in principle has been reached, because the Allied countries' purchase of aircraft worth nearly 100 million yuan will greatly increase the U.S. production capacity. The U.S. military's large-scale aircraft preparation is no longer necessary, so most of the aircraft ordered by the U.S. military can be transferred to the Allied countries. (Reuter dispatch, 23rd)

### British Submarine Fires Torpedo, Sinks German Ship; Crew Already Rescued

London: The British Admiralty stated that a British submarine sank the German ship Hedderheim eight miles off the coast of Denmark last night. All the German crew members are safe. Details will be released after the submarine returns to its original defense. (Reuter Agency dispatch, 22nd)

Copenhagen: At 11:01 am on March 21, a German ship named Hedderheim (4,947 tons) was sunk by a torpedo fired by a British submarine in the Kattegat Strait off the east coast of Denmark. The German first mate has been rescued by the submarine, while the other 36 crew members, divided into two lifeboats, were rescued by a pilot boat and taken to Germany. The British submarine first demanded the captain of the ship, but the crew told him that the captain had died. In fact, the captain had disguised himself and mixed in with the crew, escaping in a lifeboat. (Reuter dispatch, 22nd)

London: 60 crew members of a German ship landed at a port in Scotland yesterday from an armed merchant ship and were transferred to a special train to a reception camp. (Reuter dispatch, 23rd)

### Germany Repeatedly Attacks Norwegian Ships; Norway Protests to Germany; Proposes Negotiations Between the Two Countries to Reduce Dangers to Norwegian Overseas Shipping

Oslo: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a communiqué stating that the country's ambassador to Germany has delivered a note to the German Foreign Ministry protesting the country's naval warfare methods. The note stated that the naval warfare methods used by your country have caused our country to lose many ships, such as the "Eindritt"号, "Sonja"号, "Dambo"号, "Egga"号, and other ships that have successively sunk. Our government, based on the current international law and the wartime inspection regulations promulgated by your country, believes that it has the right to demand that your country's navy not attack the cargo of neutral countries' ships coming to our country, that is, our country's ships sailing to the enemy of your country, as long as they do not carry contraband, there is no reason to attack them. In short, according to international law, your country's navy cannot justify attacking neutral countries' ships in the open sea because they are forced to accept inspection by enemy warships. Our government believes that your country must share this view in principle, but the ships of our country have recently been repeatedly attacked, and therefore we have no choice but to propose that representatives of the two countries conduct negotiations as soon as possible to discuss this issue, so as to reduce the dangers to our country's overseas shipping and thereby guarantee its external supplies. Please let us know as soon as possible whether your government agrees to this proposal. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Amsterdam: London reports that the Danish ship Christianborg, 3,270 tons, and the Norwegian ship Sventa, 1,267 tons, were both sunk by torpedoes near the east coast of England. The Christianborg is the sixth Danish ship to be lost in British territorial waters in the past three days. The Sventa was hit by a bomb and damaged during a German air force attack on merchant ships escorted by British ships in Scapa Bay on the 10th. Now it has been attacked by a torpedo and will eventually sink. It is fate. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)

### Near Lobbes: Air Combat Between British and German Forces, British Plane Shot Down by Germans

Amsterdam – Near Lobbes on the Dutch-German border, an air battle occurred yesterday afternoon. One British fighter plane clashed with two German planes. The British plane was eventually shot down, its fuselage catching fire and crashing into a river on the Dutch border. Both occupants died. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)

Berlin – According to inquiries made by the Havas News Agency, regarding the circumstances of the German fighter shooting down a British plane: Yesterday afternoon, German planes and British planes engaged in fierce combat in German airspace. The British plane was destroyed and crashed on the Dutch side of the Rhine River. Two pilots attempted to parachute to safety, but unfortunately, one parachute failed. The pilot fell like a stone from the sky and died instantly. The other parachute landed within Dutch territory. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

London – According to news received last night from the coast of Norfolk, an enemy plane attempted to bomb the Cromer lightship yesterday. The Cromer lifeboat was prepared to set out, but did not. This lightship is located twenty-five miles offshore and is not equipped with self-defense capabilities, nor does it have communication equipment with the shore. This is the third lightship off the Norfolk coast to be bombed by enemy aircraft. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)

London – The Admiralty has just announced: "On the 20th of this month, three squadrons of our aircraft, while escorting a merchant convoy over the North Sea, engaged in air combat with a squadron of ten German Heinkel bombers. Our aircraft first opened fire on the approaching enemy aircraft. The German planes threw their bombs into the sea to reduce their weight, then quickly disappeared into the clouds and hastily fled. Shortly after, several enemy planes emerged from the clouds again, attempting to attack the merchant convoy. At this time, our aircraft had already dispersed. Only one aircraft bravely engaged with four enemy aircraft and eventually drove them away. This was at 7 PM. At 7:30 PM, a squadron of our aircraft, returning from escorting a merchant convoy from the North Sea, saw an enemy plane being pursued by three of our coastal patrol aircraft. They also joined the pursuit, but the enemy plane ultimately escaped without a trace. Our aircraft pilots also saw another enemy plane strafing a merchant ship with machine-gun fire. They took advantage of its unpreparedness, flew to a high altitude, and from a position of height, attacked it suddenly when they were fifty yards apart. The enemy plane's fuel tank was hit and it fled in disarray. Our plane ran out of ammunition and could not pursue it. According to a public announcement issued by the German General Headquarters, 'One of their country's aircraft failed to return to base, which probably refers to this incident.'" (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

Berlin – According to news from the German official news agency, one of the German bombers participating in the attack on the British convoy, which was reported missing yesterday, has reached the German coast despite being heavily damaged. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)

Germany Claims Sylt Island Not Damaged by Bombing

London – The British Air Ministry has just stated that the British aircraft that flew to the German island of Sylt on Wednesday to conduct reconnaissance have confirmed the success of the night raid on Tuesday and have taken photographs. However, due to the activity of enemy anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes, they could not fly close enough to take satisfactory photographs. Therefore, the photographs taken do not indicate the extent of the island's material losses. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)

Amsterdam – An American journalist published a report after inspecting Sylt Island, stating briefly that the hangars and other facilities at the Hörnum German Air Force base were undamaged. The British public has expressed doubts about the success of the British air raid, and the fact that British reconnaissance planes flew to Sylt Island after the raid to take photographs but have not yet released them, leads to the general speculation that these photographs cannot actually prove the official reports. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

Berlin – According to the "People's Observer," after inspecting Sylt Island, journalists from various countries proved that the British Air Force's retaliatory action for the bombing of Scapa Flow was a complete failure. Foreign journalists in London have also requested to inspect Scapa Flow to verify the German Air Force's "failure" news, but First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill and Secretary of State for Air Kingsley Wood have refused the inspection, citing Scapa Flow as a strategic military point that should be kept secret. However, the British side is claiming that the German planes only bombed non-military targets. Sylt Island is also a strategic military point, but foreign journalists still went to inspect it, as they did with the Kiel Canal and Wilhelmshaven, to prove that the truth of the British-reported bombing was untrue. Neutral country citizens can now verify, through the results of on-site inspections by their own journalists, that Sylt Island has not been damaged by bombing.

### Children's Day Preparatory Committee Creates Children's Welfare Badges: A Badge is Given for Every Dime Donated, Proceeds to Build a Library

The Shanghai Ninth Celebration Children's Day Preparatory Committee is actively promoting the construction of a children's library. It is reported that the committee, in order to promote fundraising, has ordered 100,000 children's welfare badges. The design is very exquisite and moving, with a picture of children reading and drawing at the center. The slogan above is "Knowledge is Power." Anyone who donates a dime will receive a Class B children's welfare badge, and anyone who donates one yuan or more will receive a Class A children's welfare badge as a souvenir. According to Chen Zhengfan, the general secretary of the committee, since the committee decided to build a children's library, it has received letters from all sides (including children) expressing enthusiastic support and willingness to help complete the fundraising goal. Now that the committee has ordered 100,000 children's welfare badges, it is confident that they will be completely distributed in a short period of time. If they are insufficient, a second and third batch will be added. What we hope is that on the Fourth of April Children's Day, whether it is a university professor, an elementary school student, or even a chauffeur, everyone will wear a children's welfare badge, indicating that they have made a contribution to children's welfare. Whether our country has been modernized and whether the citizens of Shanghai truly care for children, we will not find it difficult to obtain clear evidence of this.

### Education Bulletin

The Ministry of Education previously provided public-funded and partially public-funded places in various national secondary schools to provide relief to secondary school students in war zones. Recently, the above-mentioned relief funds have been uniformly changed to loans, and the implementation of loan measures for students in war zones has been promulgated. Now, the Ministry is following the request of National Ninth Middle School that normal school students should be treated as public-funded and should be different from loans, and that they should be exempt from meal fees. The Ministry of Education has approved this and issued an order for all national secondary schools to follow.

The normal school branch of National Second Middle School, originally located in Beibei, was part of National Second Middle School. Now, in order to improve and expand normal education as national education is about to be implemented, the Ministry of Education has ordered the school to be established independently and renamed National Chongqing Normal School, adding special normal classes and simplified normal classes. This semester, one hundred female physical education normal school students will be recruited first.

In order to improve the teaching facilities of national secondary schools, the Ministry of Education has sent Gao Weichang, a member of the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters, to Henan to inspect National First Middle School. Provinces and private colleges above the junior college level are also sending personnel to inspect and assess the schools, and this will be handled separately one after the other.

The private Wuchang China University believes that there is an urgent need for accounting talents from all sides. It plans to add an accounting specialization to the College of Commerce starting this spring in order to train accounting talents. It is reported that it has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval and record.

In order to cultivate excellent teachers for secondary schools, the Ministry of Education has formulated the Second Division enrollment measures for various normal colleges in the 29th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1940] and ordered the various normal colleges to prepare for Second Division enrollment. It is reported that the Lantian National Normal College, as it was newly established in the 27th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1938], does not yet have students in the third, fourth, and fifth grades, and advanced courses have not yet started. Establishing a Second Division would be somewhat difficult in terms of curriculum. It has already been approved by the Ministry of Education to temporarily postpone the establishment of the Second Division.

The Ministry of Education previously formed three roving drama education teams to carry out education in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan. Now, a fourth team has been added and Li Puyuan has been appointed as the team leader to depart for the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai to work.

### International Cup Loss is a Pity: China Narrowly Defeated by One Goal, Portugal Wins Championship 3-2, Controversy Over Penalty Kick

In this year's International Cup Football Championship, the Chinese team faced Portugal yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM at the Yu Garden. The audience was at least 15,000 to 16,000 people, a grand occasion no less than the Christmas Charity Match. The two sides were evenly matched, tense and exciting. Portugal's Favan Xiao took the lead, and Cao Qiuting equalized. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie. After switching sides, Favan Xiao scored again. To make matters worse for the Chinese team, Cai Shengsen suddenly left the field due to a dislocated shoulder. Fortunately, Xu Wenkui was fouled by Victor inside the penalty area for knocking down Cao Qiuting. The resulting penalty kick broke the net, making the score 2-2. Five minutes later, Favan Xiao violently collided with Meng Yiliang in the Chinese team's goal area. The referee, Pan Tuo, unexpectedly ruled Meng had committed a foul, showing blatant bias. The audience was in an uproar. Costa then scored the penalty kick, putting Portugal ahead 3-2. The army did not intend to fight again, but in order to maintain the spirit of sportsmanship, they endured the pain and continued the game. As a result, they ultimately lost narrowly by this goal, suffering a 3-2 defeat. It is reported that the Chinese team will file an appeal, but given the established facts, the organizers may not be able to handle it fairly. After the game, Major General McNorton, a member of the Appeals Committee, presented the awards, and the silver cup was continuously preserved by the Portuguese team. Yesterday's lineups for both sides were as follows:

Portugal

M. Soares, Marshall, Victor, Remedios, Costa, Silver, Attigue, Rocha Liao, Favan Xiao, Colasa, Remedios

Chinese Team

Qin Bigao, Li Yichen, Yan Shixin, Cai Shengsen, Meng Yiliang, Wang Cuixing, Wan Jin, Sun Jinshun, Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, Jia Youliang

Excellent Performance

Yesterday's performance was very exciting. Both sides were young heroes, dribbling quickly, making it a rare and exciting game this season. The Chinese army lacked a center forward, and the attacking power was considerably reduced. Wan Jin was very satisfied, while Jia Youliang, who had been away from the battlefield for a long time, performed only so-so. Gaps in the defense were visible. Li Yichen saved many dangerous situations and was indeed a meritorious official. The Portuguese army's offense was very fierce, and the defenders Marshall and Victor were more experienced than us. This is also why the Chinese army repeatedly failed to attack.

Evenly Matched

The Portuguese team asked for the ball, but was blocked back by our iron army. Li Yichen was stationed in the back, repeatedly saving dangerous situations. The Chinese team launched a counterattack, but failed to score. At 22 minutes, Portugal's Favan Xiao received a pass from Souerfo, dribbled past Li Meng, and swept the ball sideways, the ball flew out like an arrow, straight into the net. The Chinese team was not discouraged. Sun Tui sent a pass to Wan Jin, Wan did not try to take credit for himself, but passed it to Wenkui. Wenkui passed it too quickly and it went wild. At 32 minutes, Wan Jin got the ball and handed it to Tui, Sun's shot also hit the goalpost. Sun rushed to hook it back, and Cao Qiuting waited perfectly, jumping lightly, and the ball went into the net in response, tying the score at 1-1. The audience roared. Before long, Jia Youliang got the ball from the back, headed it to Wenkui, Xu shot it into Soares' arms. Later, Wenkui got the ball and passed it to Youliang, Youliang hooked it and Qiuting headed it towards the goal, but it was caught by Soares again. The first half ended with a 1-1 tie, evenly matched.

Calamity Strikes

After the lemon, the Chinese team's lineup changed slightly, with Wan Jin and Cao Qiuting switching positions to increase the offense. At 10 minutes, Costa sent a long shot, and Favan Xiao rushed straight into the Chinese army's territory, Yan Shixin failed to return to rescue in time, and the ball was scored again, 2-1, Portugal took the lead. Before long, Cai Shengsen collided with Silver, his arm dislocated, and the Chinese army had to fight with only 10 players. Three minutes later, Jinshun passed the ball to Qiuting, Victor acted roughly and knocked Cao down, resulting in a penalty kick. Xu Wenkui scored into the right corner, 2-2, tying the score again. At 18 minutes, Favan Xiao shot, Qin Bigao lay down and扑住获救. Two minutes later, Favan Xiao charged head-on, Meng Yiliang was knocked down and retreated three steps, the referee Pan Tuo unexpectedly ruled that Meng had committed a foul. Chinese team captain Sun Jinshun protested verbally to no avail. Costa then scored the penalty kick, and the Chinese team lost a goal unjustly. The Chinese generals were filled with anger and endured the pain and continued the battle, but this blow affected their morale. The Portuguese team took the opportunity to become rampant, and Qin Bigao became the target of everyone. Fortunately, Qin was agile and was not breached. As a result, at 2-3, the Chinese army ultimately lost the box office by one goal, and the Portuguese team retained the championship.

### Inauguration of the Pseudo-Central Market; Vegetable Industry Expresses Strong Opposition; Preferring Closure to Forced Participation; British Troops Install Military Telephone at the Gap

British troops opened a gap in the barbed wire on North Tibet Road, specifically for the entry and exit of people and goods from the "Pseudo-Central Market," but declared the right to lock it at any time. Recently, to strengthen defense, a military telephone was specially installed yesterday. The "market" held an opening ceremony yesterday, and British troops and concession authorities implemented temporary security measures, which were soon lifted. The Japanese puppets are pressuring the vegetable industry to participate, and the industry has made a strong statement. The details of the situation are as follows:

British Troops Install Military Telephone

The Scottish troops stationed in the "B" area of North Tibet Road, north of Suzhou Creek, at the request of the Japanese Marine Corps, opened a gap in the "B" area's barbed wire to allow people and goods from the pseudo "Central Market" to enter and exit. However, before granting the Japanese request, they declared the right to close it at any time. According to reports from the Daguang News Agency, the Scottish troops stationed in the "B" area, although a new guard post has been set up in front of the "market" gate, with soldiers stationed inside in shifts, are still concerned about the lack of means to transmit messages when necessary. To strengthen defense, a military telephone line was specially installed at the gap in the northern area, one end connected to the guard post, and the other directly to the Scottish military headquarters at the racecourse on Mahe Road, to facilitate the immediate transmission of reports and orders.

Japanese Puppets Gather; Concession on Alert

The pseudo "Central Market" held an opening ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday. In addition to representatives from the Japanese military, the pseudo "Mayor," the pseudo "Director of the Social Affairs Bureau," and other Japanese puppets of all sizes attended. Following a pre-arranged bizarre ritual, the opening ceremony was hastily conducted. Subsequently, the Japanese puppets held a meeting inside the "market's" Sihang Warehouse to discuss vegetable management methods. The Japanese puppets, to prevent unforeseen circumstances, sent several Japanese navy personnel as escorts and plainclothes guards. The gate of the venue was wide open, with a dozen pseudo-police officers strictly guarding the entrance. Entry was not permitted without special permission. A notice was posted in front of the "market" gate, stating, "The yellow cards issued by this venue will be temporarily suspended today. This announcement." Judging by the language and the security situation, it was extremely strict. Around the "market" gate, British troops and the Public Concession police also secretly dispatched soldiers and detectives to distribute and implement temporary security measures, searching pedestrians, calming the situation, and avoiding misunderstandings among residents. Security measures were lifted only after the Japanese puppets dispersed at noon.

Vegetable Industry Makes Strong Statement

When the "market" opened yesterday, white cloth banners were posted to deceive the public, specifying the opening and business days (business date: 15th). To understand the situation, a reporter from the Daguang News Agency made a special visit to a major vegetable merchant, who said that the Japanese puppets' organization of the "Central Market" was intended to control the entire Shanghai vegetable monopoly. A small number of corrupt elements in the vegetable industry were enticed to join the "market," but they do not represent the entire industry. It is rumored that merchants in the 16th Bend, Laozha Bridge, and Caojiadu areas will be forced to participate. While this is indeed a last resort, those with a conscience are determined not to collude. According to what I know, at least 90% of people would rather close their businesses than participate. This kind of pressure from the Japanese puppets is also a "stubborn" move. It is heard that the vendors in the Hongkou Triangle Vegetable Market who have agreed to participate in the "Central Market" under the influence of the Japanese military are all Japanese and White Russians, not Chinese.

### Japanese Military Ashes: 40th Transportation to Japan

The ashes of soldiers who died in battle on the Japanese front lines in China are continuously being transported to Shanghai for shipment back to Japan. It is learned that the Japanese side held a memorial service at the Hongkou Honganji Temple at 3:00 PM yesterday, and then transported the ashes to the Japanese ship Changrong Maru to return to Japan.

The Shanghai Coal and Firewood Industry Association sent a letter to all members yesterday, stating: "Regarding the resolution on coal briquettes at the members' meeting of the association on the 18th of this month, it is requested that the coal briquette industry (1) factories should not engage in retail sales, but should supply retail stores with the amount of coal briquettes in stock; (2) the price difference between wholesale and retail should be stipulated to maintain the livelihood of retail stores, and coal powder should still be exchanged for coal briquettes at a 10% discount as usual; (3) delivery by truck, each according to previous practice, and purchase notes that are generally used in Shanghai should not be refused. Major factories should supply coal powder to small factories to increase coal briquette production. The above opinions were submitted to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Public Works Department, and other departments on the 20th, and representatives were sent to petition. Now, a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the 21st has been received, stating that three points of opinion have been raised by the industry regarding the mechanized coal briquette industry, instructing to discuss with the association and fully accept and earnestly implement them. This matter has been discussed with your representatives, and with regard to the distribution of coal briquettes in stock to retail stores as much as possible, please report the actual needs of your industry in a book so that the association can forward the letter to the association and coordinate the distribution of the production volume of each coal briquette factory. Please do so as soon as possible. This has been received. It is found that the association has already sent personnel to carry out the investigation of the actual sales volume of coal briquettes in each store since the 21st of this month in order to speed up the process. However, it is found that a small number of member stores have not been contacted due to the absence of those in charge, and have not reported to the association, which is greatly delayed. It must be known that the investigation and reporting of the actual sales volume is the basis for future unified distribution, and it is also a necessary procedure in the process of solving the difficulty of purchasing goods. Conversely, it means giving up its requirements. It is hoped that the same industry stores will have a thorough understanding. If there are omissions in the investigation and the numbers are inaccurate and must be corrected, please contact the association before the 24th of this month so that they can be entered in the book. This notice is hereby issued."

### Concession Post Office Still Not Accepting Japanese Military Notes; Chinese in Occupied Areas Also Never Attempted

The Shanghai Postal Administration, after complying with the Japanese request, allows the public to purchase stamps with Japanese banknotes and Japanese military notes. However, according to reports from the Datong News Agency, the branch offices in the two concessions still refuse to use them. Even the Chinese public in the post offices in the occupied areas of Shanghai suburbs have never used Japanese banknotes and Japanese military notes to purchase stamps. Regarding the incident of the public being able to open remittances to Hankou and Jiangxi using Japanese military notes, because it violates postal regulations and at the same time uses Japanese military envelopes for shipment, and also opens an evil precedent in the history of remittances, it has attracted the attention of all sectors. According to reports from the Datong News Agency, postal branch offices in the two concessions have also not accepted the development. However, they have been found in post offices in various occupied areas of Shanghai suburbs, but only for Japanese personnel. The Chinese public can deeply understand the general righteousness and never attempt to use them.

The Public Works Department replied to the Hotel Industry Association yesterday, stating, "In reply to your letter of March 18, the Public Works Department is now increasing the business license tax for Chinese-style apartments, and the tax should have been collected in full from April 1, 1934. The previous preferential treatment is still maintained. Now, it is reiterated and organized, and in accordance with the previous resolution, full collection will begin from April 1, 1940. We regret that this matter cannot be reconsidered."

Host Chinese Directors

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Hotel Industry Association yesterday that the industry has received a reply from the Public Works Department, stating that there is no room for consideration regarding the increase in the business license tax for Chinese-style apartments, which is quite worrying.

Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, Jiang Yiping, and others will be invited to attend at that time.

The original text is recorded below: "To the person in charge of the guild, We have investigated and confirmed that Your association has "deep understanding of righteousness" and is able to protect "peace". It is especially admirable that You serve the "leader" and care about the future of the "Party and State". The delusional elements still have not awakened and continue to engage in last-ditch struggles, not hesitating to use "despicable means" to spread terror, or even trying to exert "influence" by printing blank papers in order to obstruct "peace". Such "schemes" can only lead to ruin. Your noble association has seen through their schemes and cannot be swayed by them. We are afraid that if the "lawless" continue to incite disorder. Any wavering person may fall into their trap. Therefore, this letter serves as a warning. If there is any backtracking, causing conflicts, not only will it lead to public disdain, Our office has a duty to prevent such from openly disrupting peace, and is obligated to strictly punish. Do not say that you have not been warned. To the respected Director, “The Chinese Nationalist Anti-Communist National Salvation Special Operations Headquarters" It is heard that responsible persons of various industries remained highly righteous and were unwavering by such letters, further cementing their commitment to support the national policy of resistance against Japan."

### Regulations Stipulated by the Ningbo Navigation Authorities: Safety Measures for Lighters - Taking Preventative Measures to Ensure Future Safety - The Ningbo Navigation Administration Has Ordered Shipping Companies to Comply

During the wartime period in Zhejiang Province, the Bohai Navigation Administration Office and the Ningbo Navigation Affairs Office, directly under the Ministry of Transportation, investigated the incident on March 2nd of this year, where the lighter *Jing Sheng Lun* capsized while ferrying passengers in port due to an air raid, resulting in a tragic disaster. The event occurred suddenly, making rescue impossible and causing deep regret. However, it is never too late to mend the fold. To ensure future safety, the following eight measures have been jointly formulated:

Lighter Transportation Based on Vouchers

1.  From now on, when various shipping companies in Ningbo sell passenger tickets, they should simultaneously collect the lighter fee and issue a separate lighter voucher. The voucher should have a clearly numbered serial number (the format will be determined separately). One day before departure, the shipping company should publish at each pier the passengers who should be on each lighter, based on the lighter voucher number and the departure time from the specific pier. Additionally, a large sign should be placed at each pier stating, "Passengers with Lighter Vouchers numbered X to Y should board Lighter Z," so that passengers can board the correct ship according to their number, avoiding overcrowding and overloading.

2.  Inspection soldiers at each pier should check passengers' lighter vouchers. Only those with matching voucher numbers should be allowed to board the ship in an orderly manner; otherwise, they should be stopped.

3.  The prohibition of small boats carrying passengers for illegal ferrying will be the responsibility of the Ningbo Inspection Team stationed on the ships.

4.  For large pieces of luggage that passengers cannot carry themselves, or for hand luggage exceeding two pieces, the shipping companies will be responsible for handling luggage ticket procedures and collecting luggage fees. Upon arrival, the shipping companies will properly return the luggage to the passengers.

5.  Before the departure of a large vessel, all crew members or laborers going ashore should return to the ship on the last lighter of the day. If the lighter is full, other arrangements must be made. They must not casually board the lighter to avoid disrupting order.

Strict Prohibition of Overloading

6.  When passengers from Shanghai are transferred to lighters outside Zhenhai Port, the chief officer on the ship should assign capable personnel to work with Zhenhai inspectors to implement the following measures: (A) Passengers should board the lighters from the middle wheel in an orderly manner, without rushing. (B) Absolutely no passengers or luggage should be loaded onto the wheel. (C) Each lighter is absolutely forbidden from overloading; it must leave the large vessel once full. (D) Sailing lighters are not allowed to carry passengers.

7.  The Zhenhai Inspection Team will dispatch several soldiers to the area outside Zhenhai Port to maintain order and supervise.

8.  When lighters outside Zhenhai Port arrive at the Ningbo pier, personnel from the inspection team should work with crew members to implement the following measures: (A) Small boats are not allowed to pick up passengers mid-route. (B) When the lighter approaches the pier, footmen are strictly prohibited from boarding to solicit business. (C) All travelers should be notified to maintain order. Passengers should only disembark in an orderly manner after the lighter is securely docked and the mooring ropes are fastened.

Regarding the above measures, except for items 3, 7, and 8, the Garrison Headquarters has been requested by telegram to comply with and enforce them. Yesterday, the format of the lighter voucher was copied and sent to the Zheng County Shipping Business Association, ordering them to quickly forward it to the various shipping and lighter companies for compliance. The date of compliance and details of the implementation should be reported for record.

### Shanghai's Textile Products Sell Well After the Outbreak of the European War

Since the outbreak of the European War, the sources of various raw materials in this city have become more expensive than before, especially cotton yarn. Recently, Singapore has also restricted the import of goods from countries not using the gold standard. However, various textile products in this city have not been significantly affected. Currently, the amount of various textile products in this city sold to Europe or Southeast Asia has increased sharply compared to before. Factories have added night shifts and increased production to meet demand. The details are as follows:

British Market Needs are Particularly Pressing

Since the outbreak of the European War, the sale of textile products from this city to the British, French, and other European markets has increased compared to before, especially in various British markets, the need is even more pressing. According to news from the domestic goods industry in this city, the quantity sold to the UK has increased by about seven or eight times compared to before. If the war continues, the sales of Shanghai textile products in British and French markets will inevitably increase daily. The main reasons are: (1) British and French factories have mostly converted to manufacturing all wartime necessities to adapt to the needs of the war. (2) Due to shipping relations, the sales of textile products from Canada and Japan to the UK and France have decreased, providing a good opportunity for Shanghai textile products.

Sales Expansion in Southeast Asia

Furthermore, the sales of Shanghai textile products to various territories in Southeast Asia are particularly active. Although the Singaporean authorities have banned the import of non-gold standard goods, only a small portion falls under the ban. For the most part, local merchants can request permission to transport and sell goods as needed. Moreover, markets in the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and South Africa are gradually expanding. It is expected that the sale of Shanghai textile products to the above areas will tend to increase. However, the dumping of inferior and counterfeit textile products has encountered some setbacks. If publicity is effective, so that local overseas Chinese can deeply understand the value of Shanghai textile products, the sales of Shanghai textile products in Southeast Asia are truly limitless.

### Drivers Request Increased Fuel Allowance, Negotiations Fail, Rescheduled for the 29th

The drivers of the four major car rental companies in this city, Xiang Sheng, Yun Fei, Yin Se, and Tai Lai, requested a 20% increase in their fuel allowance. After the drivers' representatives formally made the request to the company management, the driver representatives dispatched eleven representatives to the Da Hu Ballroom on Jing'an Temple Road at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday for lengthy negotiations. However, the company side believed that the request was unreasonable, while the labor side argued that it was difficult to maintain a living. The opinions of both parties could not be reconciled for the time being, so after a long discussion, a satisfactory result was not achieved. Both parties have now decided to postpone the negotiations until the afternoon of the 29th of this month. The drivers are currently working as usual, awaiting a reasonable resolution.

### Japanese Military Police Launch Search of Gambling Dens - Arrest 67 Chinese

According to the French-language newspaper, on Wednesday of this week, the Japanese military police and "police" inspected gambling dens in Western Shanghai to ensure that they complied with recently issued orders. There are more than ten gambling dens in Western Shanghai, which, although they had ceased operations for a time, are still operating secretly. The Japanese military police and "police" searched suspicious houses from noon to midnight and arrested sixty-seven people.

It was rumored that the Japanese side had set a deadline for the closure of the large and small gambling dens in the Western Shanghai Extra-Settlement Roads area, and that the gambling dens would be handed over to the "Greater Shanghai Municipal Government" for management, etc. However, Chinese and foreign parties alike were unsure about the closure or continuation of these establishments. After extensive inquiries by reporters from the Chinese News Agency, reliable sources revealed that the Japanese side had decided to order all gambling dens in the Huixi area to close by the 29th of this month. If the gambling dens stubbornly refuse to heed the warning and deliberately set up gambling operations to entice gamblers, they will be handled according to the closure procedures for the Nanshi district, and the arrested gamblers and den owners will be prosecuted, etc. It is also reported that large gambling dens such as Hollywood and Victoria are willing to close voluntarily and are now looking for sites in Macau, while other, more well-capitalized establishments are also seeking properties in Macau.

### French Concession Investigates Various Industries, Levies Occupational License Tax - Occupations Divided into Three Classes with Tax Rates Based on Rental Value - Industries Not Specified in Regulations Exempt from Tax

Since the French Concession's Board of Directors promulgated the General Occupational License Regulations, a large number of tax office personnel are being dispatched to conduct surveys of various industries within the concession in four districts to serve as a basis for taxation. The taxation method is based on the rental value of the business location. For the convenience of businesses, the Daguan News Agency reporter has specially recorded the tax amounts as follows:

Class A includes food stores, vegetable stores, butcher shops, rice stores, cooked meat stores, dairy food stores, etc. Class B includes laundry services, canned food stores, grocery stores, braised food stores, and all other commercial and industrial establishments that do not belong to Class C. Class C includes banks, silver companies, businesses or companies that manage or rent real estate, cosmetic shops, photo studios, beauty salons, embroidery and fashion stores, legal advisors and litigation agents, business agencies, and insurance agency offices, etc. This plan is based on the tax payment methods for various commercial and industrial occupations. Taxes are paid every six months. Industries not specified in the General Occupational License Regulations promulgated by the French Consulate General under Order No. 589 are exempt from taxation.

Also, the French Concession Board of Directors is levying a general occupational license tax from this year onward, and lawyers are also included in the levy. The Shanghai Lawyers Association believes that this type of tax will have a great impact on the entire association. Yesterday, it sent a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to forward the matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a reasoned negotiation. Yesterday, the association issued a notice to all members, explaining the progress of the request and stating that it had not yet received a reply from the supervising official and that further notice would be given upon receipt of the results.

Lawyer Qian Xun-jiu from the patrol station filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law, requesting prosecution. They were ordered to be remanded in custody to await sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Huang presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Shao Ziqing to two years and six months, and Zhang A-san and Li Gen-da to twelve years each for consuming drugs.

### Cutting the Throat to End Life

Yang A-tu, a local resident living at No. 14, Lane 205, Vermont Road, was 39 years old this year. He had been unemployed since the war and had a long-standing smoking habit. Due to economic difficulties, he switched to smoking the drug white powder. He became increasingly addicted and fell ill, unable to afford treatment. Plagued by poverty and illness, he became despondent and committed suicide at home on the 20th by stabbing himself in the throat with a pair of scissors. His wife discovered the incident and reported it to the police, who sent him to Guangci Hospital. However, his throat had been severed, resulting in excessive bleeding, and treatment was ineffective. He died at noon on the third day.

According to the ship's tonnage, it could have been approved.

It is now planned that the ship will temporarily continue to sail on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line.

### Shen Si-qi of Songjiang Passes Away

Mr. Shen Si-zhai of Songjiang, whose given name was Wei-xian, was a former Qing dynasty scholar who served as magistrate of Tongxiang, Jiaxing, Renhe, and other counties, earning a reputation for his outstanding governance. Especially during his tenure in Tongxiang, he handled religious cases, saving no fewer than several hundred local families. In the early years of the Republic, he served as the Speaker of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly, making many contributions. Later, he retreated to the countryside of Jiashan, reading and selling books to support himself. His scholarship in classics, essays, poetry, calligraphy, and painting were highly regarded by the world. Unexpectedly, he passed away at his Shanghai residence at the hour of Yin on the 23rd of this month, at the age of seventy-five.

Commercial News

### Food - Rice and Paddy Rice Flooding in from Xiyi - General Sentiment is Bearish

Rice prices in Wuxi have been gradually trending downwards in recent days. Compared to the highest peak last month, high-quality white japonica rice has fallen by three or four yuan per stone from 30 yuan. Although rice millers have continued to order large amounts from the Japanese, a continuous stream of paddy rice boats has arrived from neighboring areas, no fewer than sixty or seventy vessels, and there are still large quantities arriving in port. Currently, there are more than 20,000 dan of paddy rice accumulated in the river docks. Market sentiment is bearish, and merchants are eager to sell. With limited buyers, the supply is abundant, digestion is sluggish, and rice and paddy rice prices have continued to fall by one yuan to five or six jiao. On the 21st, high-quality white japonica rice opened at 25 yuan and 6 jiao to 25 yuan and 2 or 3 jiao per stone, unpolished japonica rice at 24 yuan to 23 yuan, and japonica paddy rice at 12 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen to 12 yuan per dan.

### Wuxi Wheat Falls by Two Yuan

The amount of wheat stored in Wuxi has become scarce. According to the local saying, the lunar Flower Festival is known for clear skies and bountiful harvests, and all kinds of plants are thriving. General sentiment has turned bearish, and prices are already high, so fluctuations are inevitable. On the 21st, flour mills and individual sellers traded several hundred bags at a price of 3200 or 3300 yuan, falling by more than two yuan. The quality of the grains has not changed, but the market is showing signs of weakness.

### Minfu and Other Four Banks Join the Banking Association

This bulletin announces that the Minfu, Asia, Zhouzhou, Jianhua, and Xingxu banks have recently joined the Shanghai Banking Association as member banks, which has been approved by the Executive Committee.

### Sugar Market - Coarse White Sugar Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be tight. The association's prices continued to rise. The current price for No. 24 coarse white sugar, new stock arriving at the outer warehouse on March 18, was 62 yuan and a half to 62 yuan and 2 or 3 jiao, an increase of 3 or 5 jiao. Transshipment goods were 48 yuan and 7 jiao, an increase of 7 jiao. Taikoo carted white B brand new goods at the western warehouse were 67 yuan and 8 jiao, old goods at the eastern warehouse were 66 yuan and 9 jiao, with leftovers remaining. National sugar is not yet available due to the Spring Festival holidays. Only after customs clearance will there be a proper market.

### Coal - Bituminous Coal Quiet - Sales Are Subdued

Previously, all grades of bituminous coal were in high demand due to spot shortages, and black market prices once reached as high as 250 or 260 yuan. However, due to the high cost, bathhouses are now switching to white coal, and the sales to the boiled water industry have also been reduced due to the supply of cheap coal ash. Sales in this street are inevitably subdued, and prices have fallen. Indian ash is currently priced at 230 yuan per ton, Kaiping No. 1 ash at 225 yuan, No. 2 ash at 220 yuan, and Keelung coal at 215 yuan, delivered to the customer's house, including the cost of carrying. This is a drop of 30 to 40 yuan from the highest peak last month.

### Seafood - West Coast Mussel Price

Recently, the cost of mussels from the West Coast has increased frequently, and the cost of calculating shipping has reached 220 yuan, exceeding the price in Shanghai by 30 or 40 yuan. Therefore, the market price here has also tightened. Yesterday, it was 490 yuan. It is said that the supply in the market is very thin, and there is a tendency for prices to continue to rise.

### Textiles: The Market Price of Woolens Soars

Currently, whether for Chinese or Western clothing fabrics, woolens are all increasing in price. Comparing the current market with that of the previous two years is like comparing heaven and earth. Among Chinese clothing fabrics, the most popular and best-selling are thin plain serge, Walter cloth, and thin fancy woolens. What used to cost 70-80 cents a foot now requires at least two yuan per foot at the cheapest. Walter cloth, fancy woolens, and summer cloth that previously sold for 1.70-1.80 yuan a foot were already considered top-grade. Now, even at 3.50 yuan a foot, they are not necessarily satisfactory. To obtain pure wool British woolens, one must spend 5-6 yuan per foot. For Western clothing fabrics, what used to be considered high-end at 15-16 yuan a yard now costs 25-26 yuan and is still considered ordinary low-grade goods. Consequently, the average price for a custom-made suit at a Western clothing store is around 150 yuan in legal tender. Suits that cost 100 yuan in the previous two years could afford top-quality pure wool woolens.

Regarding textile exports, 76 pieces were shipped to Saigon on the 23rd, and 55 pieces were shipped to Siam. On the 24th, 140 pieces and then another 120 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 25 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 985 pieces to Haikou, and to Haiphong.

### Metals: Tinplate Prices Increase Again by Five Yuan

The tinplate market has not been very active recently, as high prices have reduced actual sales for factories and merchants are also being cautious. Yesterday, the entire city only traded a few hundred boxes, mainly involving factories and businesses from Tianjin and Yantai. However, market conditions have slightly improved compared to before. There are reports of rising prices for overseas orders, and supply sources are not smooth. Speculation continues, with 180-pound Double Crown tinplate selling for 195 yuan per box, 180-pound American Double tinplate selling for 205 yuan per box, and 200-pound American tinplate requiring around 215 yuan per box, all about five yuan higher than before. However, large 24-gauge tinplate has decreased by 1,000 yuan per box, while 26-gauge large tinplate from British and Italian sources is selling for 380 yuan per box, and American goods require 430 yuan per box.

### Cement and Steel Bar Sales Sharply Decline

Cement and steel bars are the most widely procured goods by construction firms in this area. However, recently, due to tight credit and unease in the market, the purchase of these goods by these firms has significantly decreased, resulting in quiet daily trading. Some out-of-town firms are still shipping goods, but in small quantities. Prices have not fluctuated much, with Ma Brand cement selling for 24 yuan per barrel, white cement for 80 yuan per barrel, and 3-4 fen bamboo-joint steel bars quoted at 1,050 yuan per ton, and 5-1 cun bamboo-joint steel bars selling for around 1,000 yuan per ton.

### Imports and Exports: Cotton Yarn Shipped to the South

On the 24th, export goods included 525 bags of soybeans, 26 pieces of tea, 177 sheep, and 25 bales of rayon, all shipped to Hong Kong. Furthermore, on the 23rd, 25 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, and on the 24th, 200 pieces were shipped to Haiphong, 65 pieces to Haikou, 164 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 65 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Past News Newly Copied: 67 Years Ago () (See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)

Beat, Beat, Beat

The Hengsheng Tea Shop in this port, due to a dispute between Cantonese workers and local workers over tea frying, was reported to the Mixed Court. Magistrate Chen ordered the seriously injured Shen Rende and two others to be handed over to the county for investigation. Yesterday, Magistrate Mo Zun read out that hiring workers should be at the master's discretion, as had already been instructed in previous proclamations. How could they gather a crowd and act wildly? After examining Shen Rende's injuries, which were very minor, he ordered him to be beaten with 40 strokes of the rattan. Shen also claimed that the injury to his foot was indeed serious, so he was beaten with another 20 strokes of the rattan and locked up at the main gate. The other two were not even examined for the severity of their injuries, but each received 40 strokes of the rattan and were detained for further investigation. He also declared that even if all Cantonese workers were hired, local workers must not compete for the jobs. Violators would be severely punished. Some people said that hiring should be at the master's discretion, and local workers dared to compete with Cantonese workers, the fault lies here, not there. However, since the Western doctor had already confirmed that Shen Rende had serious internal injuries, it would be acceptable to reprimand him and ignore the injuries. Instead, he first beat him because the injury was minor, then beat him again because he claimed the injury was serious, and finally, he beat the other two without even asking if they were injured. In short, it was all about beating. Yao wanted to execute him three times, but Zixia advocated pardoning him three times. Magistrate Zun ordered to beat him three times, hence the direct title: Beat, Beat, Beat.

Two Old Men Fight Each Other

The other day, in a certain lane in Yangzhou, two old men fought each other. One was 81 years old, and the other was 73 years old. They grappled with each other. The 73-year-old man sustained serious injuries and was carried home, where he died within half an hour. His family wanted to seek justice, intending to sue, but stopped when they heard that the other old man had also died from injuries. Alas! If he had died, he would truly have died innocently. In the Hong Fan, the five blessings are: first, longevity; fifth, a peaceful end. But even those who are long-lived cannot enjoy all the blessings. How stingy heaven is!

Children's Weekly

### Family Life and School Life

— Nv Wan

Children, let's calculate how much time we spend at home and how much time we spend at school. Suppose a child goes to school at 7:00 AM and leaves at 4:00 PM, they only spend nine hours at school and a full fifteen hours at home. Although this isn't the case for every child, we generally spend more time at home than at school. If our family life is well-organized and orderly, then our school life will surely be fulfilling and insightful.

At home, we interact with our parents and siblings, and life is relaxed and free. Although a strict father might urge and teach you, the love of a kind mother often makes you lazy and idle. At school, we interact with teachers and classmates, and life is disciplined and regulated. If you do something wrong, your classmates will point it out and ridicule you, and the teacher will severely reprimand you, forcing you to improve yourself. Thus, family and school life cannot be connected and cooperate with each other. For example, in science class, we learn that eating snacks is harmful, but when we return home, we buy and eat whatever we want. At school, when it's our turn to be on duty, we sweep the floor and wipe the desks, but at home, we don't even bother to tidy up our own clothes and books. If we continue like this, how will our studies improve, and how will our lives be fulfilling and enjoyable? Therefore, the connection between family and school life, in addition to requiring the help of teachers and parents, also requires the children themselves to be at the center and make efforts to connect them. Be a good student at school, a good child at home, and a good citizen for the country.

How can we make family and school life cooperate? Here are a few points to tell you:

(1) At school, we only gain knowledge, such as not eating snacks, not lying, working diligently, being neat and clean, etc. There are many things we are told to do, so you must not only know but also apply them to our family life and see if the results can satisfy you.

(2) Around our homes, there are many uneducated people who don't know that cold water contains bacteria, that vegetables contain vitamins, so you should tell them so that everyone has common knowledge.

(3) Have a regular family life. At home, it should be like at school, with fixed times for eating, sleeping, reading, and playing, so that our lives are orderly and we complete the day's work from beginning to end. Then, we won't feel inconvenienced by time at school either.

If you are willing to do as said, plus children's self-exhortation and hard work, then our lives will surely improve and be valuable.

### From the Seventy-Two Martyrs to Mr. Huang Xing

— Long Ju Sheng

Children, time flies so fast. In just four more days, it will be the 29th anniversary of the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. To admire the martyrs and commemorate them with deep sorrow, we must not "forget our ancestors." The National Government authorities, due to the period of resistance and nation-building, specially re-stipulated that the memorial days of Mr. Deng Zhongyuan's martyrdom on March 23, Mr. Hu Zhantang's death on May 12, Mr. Chen Yingshi's martyrdom on May 18, Mr. Liao Zhongkai's martyrdom on August 20, Mr. Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom on September 21, and Mr. Huang Xing's death on October 31, etc., be merged into the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day and held at the same time. These many martyrs were all contributors to the creation of the Republic of China and are worthy of being recorded in history for eternity. The author will briefly discuss the historical facts of the Seventy-Two Martyrs to Mr. Huang Xing for the children to read!

The Seventy-Two Martyrs: In the third year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty (1911), on March 29, revolutionary Huang Xing (Ke Qiang) and others led a rebellion to attack the Governor-General's office of Guangdong and Guangxi. Naval Admiral Li Zhun led his troops to arrive, and the revolutionaries were defeated. The troops that were supposed to respond also did not mobilize, so the event failed. Xing was injured and escaped, and the other martyrs who died, according to the investigation at the time, numbered seventy-two, so they were called the "Seventy-Two Martyrs" and were buried together at "Huanghuagang" (now northeast of Guangzhou City, at the foot of Baiyun Mountain). Therefore, they are also known as the Huanghuagang Martyrs. After the founding of the Republic of China, the day of their uprising was designated as Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, Lin Sen and others repaired their tomb and successively found out the names and native places of the Seventy-Two Martyrs and engraved them on the monument to be passed down forever.

Mr. Huang Ke Qiang: Revolutionary leader Huang Xing, styled Ke Qiang, was talented in literature and had great courage. In the late Qing Dynasty, he advocated revolution with Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In the Dingwei year of the Guangxu reign (1907), he launched an uprising in Hekou, Yunnan. After the failure, he fled to Vietnam. In March of 1911, he led a crowd to attack the Governor-General's office in Guangzhou and was defeated again by Li Zhun, suffering injuries but barely escaping. After the Wuchang Uprising in October, he fought a great battle with the Qing army in Hanyang. After the recovery, the Nanjing government was established, and he served as the Minister of the Army. Later, Yuan Shikai took office as president, and the government moved north. Xing stayed to guard Nanjing. After Song Jiaoren was assassinated, he rose up to oppose Yuan without success and fled to Japan. He later went to Nanyang and died in Shanghai.

### The Unstoppable Clock

— Su Ming

The clock ticks, ticking away, the pendulum swinging from left to right, from right to left endlessly. The long and short hands race each other on the clock face day and night. Although the long hand walks very fast, often passing the short hand and leading the way, the short hand is still unwilling to be outdone, persevering, not feeling discouraged by its slowness, still inching along like a snake, step by step, but sometimes it can walk ahead of the long hand. It turns out they are holding a round-robin race! But after walking like this for about a week, they finally rested together, because their driving force - the spring - had become exhausted, so the clock stopped walking. Zong'er is the starter who commands them to continue the race again. It turns out that the work of winding the clock in his house has always been his responsibility, because he is taller and stronger, so this work is of course easy for him, but whenever he hears his mother calling him to wind the clock, he always can't muster up his interest, even though his younger brother - Yong'er - is very happy to wind the clock, his mother doesn't ask his younger brother to go, but insists on calling him to do it.

"If there were a clock that never stopped, that would be great. I wouldn't have to do this thing I don't like to do anymore," Zong'er muttered as he wound the clock.

Yong'er said with a sarcastic tone: "Then leave it for you to invent."

"Don't mock me, this kind of clock that never stops has already been invented in the eighteenth century, but unfortunately, too much time has passed, and it has been lost to this day, but some astronomers can recall it, and it is possible to manufacture it again, but it has not been successful." These words aroused Yong'er's attention, and he hurriedly asked Zong'er what it was like?

"This kind of non-stop clock works by absorbing the endless power it needs from the surrounding environment. It is based on the principle of a mercury barometer, because the atmospheric pressure changes from time to time, the mercury goes up and down, and the pointer also shakes non-stop. Applying this movement of the barometer to the clock, the clock can run permanently without our care. It is said that its structure is very complicated, almost like a large-scale mercury barometer: there is a mercury glass pot hanging on a horizontal frame, and inside the pot is a long-necked glass tube containing a mercury gall bottle, these two things are actively connected, which is a very ingenious lever. When the atmospheric pressure is high, the mercury in the glass tube is pressed down and the mercury pot is raised, and when the pressure is low, the opposite happens. This two-way motion allows the small gears on the clock to rotate in one direction. If the air pressure does not change, the gears will not move, and the clock will stop. Then there is the power of a pre-stored hammer falling to activate it, and the clock will run again. But after the hammer falls, it is not easy to make it rise, and at the same time, the shaking force of the air pressure is also difficult to apply, and the lifting of the hammer must have a certain regularity. These kinds of difficulties have not yet been overcome, and the price of this clock is much more expensive than the current clock, and it is also very bulky, so no one is happy to use it until now."

### Black Brothers (11)

— Yi Mu

At this moment, he had to walk up a mountain ridge made entirely of red stones. There wasn't a single blade of grass on the ground, and his feet hurt as he stepped on it. There wasn't even a protruding rock above him to shield him from the terrifying sunlight. It was just past noon, and the scorching sun shone on the uneven mountain path, and even the air was still and filled with heat. Hans was thirsty and exhausted, in great pain. He kept looking at the water bottle hanging on his belt, thinking to himself, "Three drops of water would be enough, even if it can't quench my thirst, it can at least cool my lips."

He opened the water bottle and brought it to his mouth, but his eyes saw a small thing lying on the rock beside him, seemingly moving. It turned out to be a puppy, obviously struggling with death from extreme thirst. Its tongue was stretched out of its mouth, its gums were dry, and its limbs were limp. Black ants were crawling around its lips and throat. At this time, it widened its eyes and looked at the water bottle in Hans's hand. Hans drank the water in the bottle himself, kicked the dog with his foot, and continued forward. He didn't know why, but he felt a strange shadow suddenly appear in the azure sky.

The mountain path became more and more inclined and uneven. The air in the high mountains not only didn't feel refreshing, but seemed to make his blood burn. The sound of the waterfall rushing down mocked him in his ears, because it was very far away, and his thirst was increasing minute by minute. After another hour, he looked at the small bottle at his waist again. Although the bottle was already half empty, it still had more than just a drop left. He stopped, opened the lid of the water bottle, but just at this moment, he saw something moving on the mountain path above. It turned out to be a pitiful child, half-dead, lying on the stone, also extremely thirsty, his chest constantly rising and falling, his eyes closed, and his lips burning with dryness. Hans glanced at him indifferently, drank the water, and continued forward again.

A smear of grey-brown dark clouds covered the sunlight, and snake-like shadows slowly spread across the mountainside. Hans struggled forward, exhausted beyond belief. The sun was sinking, but it still didn't feel cool. On the contrary, he felt that the suffocating and heavy air was pressing down on his head and heart. Fortunately, the destination was gradually getting closer. He saw the Golden River waterfall jumping out from the mountainside, less than five hundred feet above his head. He stopped, took a breath, and rushed forward.

Just then, he heard a weak cry. He turned around and saw an old man with white hair lying on the stone. His eyes were sunken, his face was as pale as death, and a look of despair was all over his face. He stretched out his arms to Hans and shouted weakly, "Water! Water! I'm dying of thirst." Hans replied angrily, "I don't have any water. You've lived long enough for your age." So he stepped over the stiff body and strode upward.

### Christ is Risen (In Commemoration of the Resurrection Day of the Lord Jesus)

Jesus' death was a contribution in the negative sense, while resurrection and ascension are positive contributions. Without Jesus rising from the dead, we would have no living hope. Jesus was handed over for our transgressions and was raised to justify us. Since we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, having been reconciled, we shall be saved through His life. If Jesus had not been resurrected, our faith would be in vain and would not differ much from other religions. When evening came, there was a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance and left. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. The next day, the day after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said, "Sir, we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' Therefore, command that the tomb be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal him away and tell the people that he has risen from the dead. Then this last deception will be worse than the first." Pilate said, "Take a guard and secure it as well as you know how." So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and posting the guard. When the Sabbath was over, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. Suddenly there was a great earthquake, because an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled back the stone, and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow. The guards were so terrified of him that they shook and became like dead men. The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; for he has risen, just as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you." So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" They came to him, clasped his feet, and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, "You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.' If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day. Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." Therefore, the Lord Jesus in whom we believe is not sleeping in the tomb but is alive in heaven, because He is the Son of God and cannot be held by death. The Holy Spirit in our hearts also bears witness to this. He is the vine, and we are the branches. The foundation of Christians is stable in heaven, so no matter what suffering we endure, it cannot be destroyed or diminished, for He is the head of the church, living forever and ever.

### The Future of Color Films

—維特

Undoubtedly, as long as science progresses, the film industry in the entertainment world will also improve. According to the current general preference for watching movies and those who use movies as a pastime and entertainment, they are most satisfied with color films in their minds. Facts prove that "Robin Hood" and "Gulliver's Travels" both made exaggerated publicity of their color components, so the box office was naturally good. Therefore, I say that in the future of movies, color films will inevitably eliminate the entire situation of black and white films, which is inevitable. Let me tell you the reasons:

Movies can capture all the activities of people or other animals into the lens and re-project them. The only regret is that they cannot capture the natural scenery into the film. The green waves, the tender green leaves, and the scarlet flowers, when we look at them on the silver screen, are still just black and white mixed pictures. Although this picture is not annoying, it is not as moving as the real thing. In order to cater to the psychology of the audience, smart filmmakers add color to the black and white pictures, which is color films. However, this kind of color film is often too exaggerated, and some places are somewhat distorted.

American film engineers are studying the method of making true color films with "single roll" camera. Only a set of soft films coated with various colloids is used. After exposure, it can be obtained by special development method. The film of "natural color", but this new method has not yet been successfully researched, but it will definitely be realized in the near future, and black and white films will undoubtedly suffer a very unfortunate fate.

The meritorious officials of color films are Frederick.E.Ives, Charles Urban, Albert, G.Smith, etc., but these are all researchers of color films fifty years ago, and there are still many unknown meritorious officials who are participating in the development of color films.

### Sharp Organization in the Art World

—海星

—Distributed in Sichuan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi—

Since the outbreak of the "August 13" war, artists in various departments of literature, art, film, drama, and music have launched their own salvaging organizations, such as salvaging drama troupes and singing troupes, and have been developing to various places to do their work. However, these organizations are mobile and mostly independent. After more than 30 months of war, they have gradually become fixed and concrete organizations. The reporter has learned that these organizations are located in the rear, and they are recorded below to inform the gentlemen who care about art. In Chongqing: there are the "National Drama Association", the "National Literary and Art Circles Anti-Enemy Association", the "China National Music Circles Anti-Enemy Association", and the "National Cartoon Writers Association Sichuan Branch". In Guilin: there are the "National Cartoon Writers Association", the "Literary Association Guilin Branch", and the "Literary and Art Workers Association".

In Kunming: there are the "Drama Association Kunming Branch" and the "Literary Association Kunming Branch". In Chengdu: there is the "Literary Association Chengdu Branch". In Ganzhou: there is the "Jiangxi Literary Association". These organizations distributed in various places are working hard in coordination with the evolution of the war.

### The Lan Sisters' Five-Year Plan

—陸德綱

The Lan sisters, who starred in "Four Daughters", and their sworn sisters Jian'er Panqi, have become famous since the release of the film "Four Daughters" last year; countless audiences have written letters to congratulate them, praising their artistic skills, and hoping that they can continue to act in more lovely films. Seeing that they have such appeal, the film company immediately signed a five-year contract with them. The four sisters also agreed with the company to set a five-year plan, preparing to specialize in films about "Four" in these five years. In addition to "Four Daughters" and the current "Four Wives", they will continue to star in "Four Mothers", "Four Divorced Wives", "Four Sins", "Four Broken Mirrors Reunited" and other four, four, four, ... and other films, please readers wait and see!

### Listening to Ms. Jiao Hongying's Debut in "The Romance of the Golden Bracelet"

—碩

"The Romance of the Golden Bracelet" is a new play written by Mei Wanhuashi. It was performed several times on the sea three years ago. Although there is no bizarre plot in the middle, there is singing and acting. To add color to the plainness, those who do not have considerable cultivation in Peking Opera performance will not be able to do it well. Ms. Jiao Hongying, a famous female ticket, is the daughter of Jiao Ding鏜, a famous lawyer in Shanghai. She is twenty years old, intelligent, and excels among her peers. She is also kind-hearted. In her spare time from reading, she is very fond of Qingyi and Daoma operas. Whenever there are obligatory charity events that invite Ms. Jiao to participate, she is happy to perform, regardless of the cold or heat. I have seen her performing "Yu Shi Feng", "Visiting Mother", "Yu Tang Chun", and "Rainbow Pass", and I sighed that she is a beautiful talent endowed by heaven. Recently, Ms. Jiao's father joined his father's Disaster Relief Entertainment Conference and performed this play, playing Jiang Qiulian. After three days of separation, I was really impressed. When she was beaten by her stepmother, her delicate and tactful expression, and the new tune of Manban Erhuang were presented one after another. Her singing and acting skills have reached a pure and mature state. The scene of picking firewood is the most exciting part of the whole play. She sings "Nan Bangzi" to ask the wet nurse to communicate the meaning of Liu Chunfa's desire for a phoenix to her. She expresses her difficult feelings, shy and hesitant, sometimes sad and sometimes happy, one sentence is one color, which is really wonderful. We admire Ms. Jiao, who is pleading for the disaster-stricken compatriots, and her kindness is reminiscent of her father's style. However, the excellence of her artistic skills is just a trivial matter, so I am happy to record it.

### Wen Tianxiang Performed Yesterday

—游記者

This time, the Refugee Association hosted a disaster relief entertainment conference at the New World, and the Shanghai drama circle also participated in a charity performance. "Wen Tianxiang" is the most exciting and successful of the five one-act plays. Although the original author of this script, Kong Linjun, has left Shanghai, this precious drama he left to the "isolated island" drama circle has been performed countless times by many drama groups.

The performance results of the four plays "Father Returns", "After Returning Home", "Shikumen", and "Elopement" are also good. Compared with them, the story and dialogue of "Wen Tianxiang" leave the audience with many exciting and profound ideas. Hundreds of viewers applauded enthusiastically and instinctively.

The story of "Wen Tianxiang" is worth introducing. It is written about the end of the Southern Song Dynasty, when the Yuan soldiers invaded the Song Dynasty. Song Prime Minister Wen Tianxiang was ordered by King Yi to raise the King-Protecting Army and resist the Yuan soldiers with all his strength. Unfortunately, he was captured. After surrendering to the Yuan Dynasty, Song traitor Zhang Hongfan wanted to persuade Wen to surrender, using all kinds of threats and inducements, but Wen refused to surrender and asked for death generously. In this short one-act play, the exposure and depiction of loyalty, treachery, good, and evil exert the highest dramatic power. In addition to "Regret of the End of the Ming Dynasty", "Wen Tianxiang" is the best compact and short one-act play of this year.

### Martyrdom of the Love Saint

—企華

"Martyrdom of the Love Saint" is the work of Kilbling, the author of "Gonggeting". So when Courmont went blind and his masterpiece was destroyed, he was sent to the battlefield, leading the way and rushing to the natives' fire line, and "martyred" for the "country". But with the beginning and end cut off from the "war of aggression", "Martyrdom of the Love Saint" has a very moving story: a painter who became famous could not get the love of his childhood lover. Before his last masterpiece was completed, he knew that his eyes would be blind; this stimulation made him work harder to paint, but this masterpiece was also destroyed under the hatred of "Checkertl".

This story can't help but remind me of Cherkibauyu and Irene Deng's "Love Pet in the Painting", but the director of "Martyrdom of the Love Saint" cannot make this moving story jump vividly on the screen, but instead makes people feel dull. Here are a few examples: (1) When Dick knew he was going to be blind; (2) His painting was destroyed, but he didn't know it yet, and gave it to Macy to watch. (3) Bessie told him that she had painted over the painting; the directors of these three important plays did not tightly grasp the tragic atmosphere, especially (2) When Dick uncovered the cloth, the audience laughed instead. At the same time, the relationship between Dick, Macy, and Bessie is not clear enough. This shortcoming, the story is too long is naturally a major reason, if the opening uses three subtitles to introduce three times and places, you can see the director's difficulty in dealing with this story.

Courte's play is hard-working, but for the above reasons, it cannot give people a deeper impression. Ida Robino's Bessie is "impersonating", laughing loudly (this is also the best-handled play in the whole film) and saying that she has painted over the painting fully depicts the "melancholy" character.

### Diao Ban Hua and Yan Xijiao

Diao Ban Hua seems to have changed from the past, a passionate person has become as cold as ice, not only that, but also always refuses guests behind closed doors except for filming, and her whereabouts can hardly be found in the social circles. She came to Shanghai alone from Hong Kong last year and joined Yihua Company. She only filmed one "Wang Baochuan", and the appearance is very good. It can be said that Diao Ban Hua is very destined for ancient costume films. This spring, Yue Feng re-directed "Yan Xijiao" in Yihua. Beforehand, the candidates for the protagonist were determined to be two, one was Yu Sulian, and the other was Diao Ban Hua. Later, after everyone considered, they thought that Yu Sulian's egg was too square, and her speech had the Qi school style, so they decided to use Diao Ban Hua. The male protagonist who matched her was Mei Xi. Sure enough, Diao Ban Hua was very careful this time, and completely made out the identity of "Yan Xijiao" as a literary and flirtatious person. Yue Feng said: Diao Ban Hua is going to be popular this time. Diao Ban Hua herself also said: This time, she can finally do the play properly. It can be seen from this the outline of the content of the film.

### Ballad Singing Twenty Kinds

—Written by Dongxue, Illustrated by Yan

(2) Jade Dragonfly

The location of this story is Nanhāo in Suzhou. The playboy Jin (originally written as Shen, later changed to Jin at the request of the descendants of the Shen family) Guisheng was shocked by the beauty of You'an, immersed in it and forgot to return, and used indulgence to kill his life! The nuns are enchanting, but only Zhi Zhen can understand true love; she gave birth to a son, and in order to maintain the reputation of the Buddhist school, she painfully abandoned him outside the nunnery, tied with a jade dragonfly (a fan pendant used by Guisheng) to wait for him to prove it in the future. This son (named Yuanzai) was adopted by others, studied and entered the official career. After he became rich, he came to the nunnery to recognize his mother."

This book was once banned from singing because of "damage to public morals".

### National Tomb-Sweeping Day

—塵

The National Tomb-Sweeping Day of the Republic of China in 1929 is coming in a blink of an eye. Today, when the land is crisscrossed by wars, we feel the greatness of its significance even more.

In order to commemorate the sagely emperors, enlightened kings, famous ministers, and good generals who have made great contributions to our nation, such as the Yellow Emperor, Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang, Emperor Taizu of Ming, Yue Fei, and Qi Jiguang, we specifically designate Qingming Day as the National Tomb-Sweeping Day, and hold ceremonies to sweep their tombs to show our respect. At the same time, we take them as role models, inherit their legacy, and maintain the glorious history of the past. This is the original intention of holding this ceremony, which began in the Republic of China in 1923.

Counting on our fingers, it has been seven years since then, and the enhancement of national consciousness in these seven years has been truly progressing by leaps and bounds. When we look at history, we know that the Chinese nation has a special characteristic, that is, the more foreign enemies invade, the stronger and more energetic the unity among the nation becomes. "Adversity strengthens the nation" is probably what it means. Therefore, since the outbreak of the July 7th Lugouqiao War, although a line or a point of territory has been temporarily occupied, the glory of the nation has not been frustrated as a result; on the contrary, it has become more and more glorious.

Another characteristic is the persistence of national struggle. When we look at it, after foreign races entered and occupied the land in the past dynasties, folk secret organizations united by national consciousness flourished and lasted for a long time; in addition, the fierceness of revolutionary groups at the end of the Yuan Dynasty and the end of the Qing Dynasty all prove that although the Chinese nation is temporarily trapped in subjugation on the surface, the hearts of the people do not die even after hundreds of years. Once there is an opportunity, they will rise up and restore the country. What's more, the current government is not only unharmed in strength, but also becoming stronger day by day. This point, on the eve of this National Tomb-Sweeping Day, can be used to comfort the spirits of many national heroes in heaven.

Ancients said, "Strong grass is known in a strong wind, and heroes are recognized in troubled times." In today's war of resistance, except for a few who are willing to be slaves, thousands of national heroes, named or unnamed, have died for the country on the battlefield, so the National Tomb-Sweeping Day after the completion of the war of resistance will inevitably be more grand and enthusiastic than it is now, which is undoubtedly.

The Meaning of History

Regarding the significance of the Guangzhou March Revolution of 1911, the general focus is on the consequences of the successful revolution five months later. In terms of the expression of the revolutionary spirit, the significance of this decision is even greater than the successful one in October. The March Revolution was a plan that the Kuomintang devoted all its efforts to, so it best represents the revolutionary nature. It failed because it had not yet fully won the support of the army, but if it were not for its own strength, and it had dispersed part of it in advance, it would have been sufficient to succeed. If successful, it would give us an example of a purely people's revolution, and even if it failed, it would strengthen the manifestation of this nature.

Some Unknown Heroes

If we could have the entire list of the 800 pioneers who were scheduled to launch this incident, we would be able to examine the breadth of the nature. However, "the organization of the pioneers is for the sake of secrecy, and only the leaders of each department are responsible, so that other people in the department do not know their names." And the leaders who were responsible for one aspect at the time, such as Song Yulin, Li Wenfu, and Luo Zejun, have all died at the time, so the names of the masses they had planned to lead were naturally impossible to know. As for the leaders of other aspects who survived, after the failure of the riches, they did not want to think about the masses who had been dispersed or mistakenly hit in advance. In fact, it would be very meaningful to investigate and clarify them in the future. Even if the dispersal can be ignored, there are many who actually participated and fortunately survived at that time, and now it seems that there is no way to know all of them. Among them, there must be many unknown heroes, or they have already passed away unnoticed. It seems that the current commemoration can also include them.

An Interesting Statistic

Judging from the dead at the time alone, we can also see that they represent people from all walks of life. The total number of dead at that time does not seem to be completely clear yet. The names of the seventy-two martyrs under Huanghuagang are different from the seventy-two people listed in the People's Eight Stele Table, which is very obvious, because some of them died after the Huanghuagang burial, and some were buried in their hometowns, so seventy-two is naturally just a representative number. From the list of 875 people, we classify the occupations of each martyr, and there are 10 students studying abroad, 8 scholars, 11 businessmen, 8 workers, 11 farmers, hunters, and martial artists, 13 who had studied in the military, and 24 who were not detailed, and most of them probably belonged to farmers and workers. They mostly belonged to the command of Huang Kecheng. Students studying abroad and farmers stood on the front line completely equally, which shows the firmness of their combination.

Geographical Distribution

In terms of region, the original籍页 of each martyr is also widely distributed. Due to the relationship of the starting point, naturally most of them are from Guangdong, with 49 people, 7 from Guangxi, 19 from Fujian, and 2 each from Sichuan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and 1 unknown. In this plan, it was originally decided that after Gong occupied Guangzhou, Huang Xing would lead an army out of Hunan to Hubei, Zhao Shengtai would lead an army out of Jiangxi to Nanjing, and comrades from other places would be deployed in other places, so only a few comrades from Sichuan Province belonged to Huang Xing, and there were more subordinates of Zhao Sheng, but they were sent back to Hong Kong in advance, and when they were recalled again, Zhao's subordinates who went to the province did not report to the representative organization, and some even took travel expenses to the province and fled, saying that they were dissatisfied with the sudden advance and retreat of the military order. Therefore, Huang Xing had the sigh of "Li Wenfu and Luo Zejun are difficult to manage." Zhao Sheng's death was probably related to his anger at this situation, but there were still six people who had difficulties, and since Song and Zhao had died, no one mentioned the others who may have also encountered difficulties. Even among the six people, Shi Dekuan and Cheng Liang were not included in the batch of 56 people who were determined, and Hua Jinyuan, Ruan Desan, and Xu Guotai were not included in the 72 people, which shows that there may be others besides this. This is also worth asking the comrades who participated in the same department and fortunately escaped to inquire more about.

An Elderly Martyr

The age of the dead, except for those who are unknown above, most of them are above 20 and below 30, which shows that the Chinese revolution has always been based on young people from the beginning. One person is under 20; there are nine people over 30; among them, Jiang Jifu can be regarded as special. He was born as a farmer, and his age was roughly close to 60. When the incident occurred, he was originally dissuaded from participating because of his old age, but he finally bravely participated, so there was also a representative of the clear and courageous old man in the martyrs. This kind of unity without age, region, or status difference is forever growing in China.

### Thinking of the "Friends of Wounded Soldiers" Movement from Selling Paper Flowers for Donations

— Chuan

After the war, I stayed in Hong Kong for a short period, and naturally, I didn't have a particularly good impression of that society. However, two things deeply moved me: one was charity sales for donations, and the other was raising funds by selling paper flowers. Most of the charity sales for donations were done by small shops and street vendors. This place truly demonstrated the "Cantonese spirit" of the Guangdong people. Their enthusiastic response to the donation movement in the mainland was rarely seen elsewhere. When a street vendor held a charity sale, they would specify the amount they wanted to sell to use as a donation. They would shout, put up slogans, and seem to be driven crazy. This situation often led to misunderstandings with the police, who thought they were disturbing public order and sometimes arrested them. However, whenever this happened, their companions would always come forward to help them out, and their enthusiasm for charity sales would increase even more. It was very common for a street vendor to donate hundreds of gold, or a very simple shop to donate thousands of gold, entirely to the country. Moreover, there was a fierce competition among them: if A donated five hundred gold, B would try to surpass A by specifying that they would donate one thousand gold! If A's trade association planned to donate tens of thousands of gold, B's trade association would have to surpass A's trade association by donating a larger amount. In this way, it was very common to contribute hundreds of thousands of gold in just a few days.

The donation movement occurred only a few times a year, which was less frequent than raising funds by selling paper flowers. Another difference was that the latter was mostly done by female students from schools. The price of each flower was only ten cents, and the funds raised were also used for charitable purposes. However, every Saturday and Sunday morning throughout the year, the sidewalks of Hong Kong were densely populated with these flower girls. No matter who you were, if you traveled along the main streets, you were sure to encounter them. They would smile at you and ask you to spend ten cents to buy a flower and pin it on your lapel. Therefore, every Saturday and Sunday morning, as long as you had been outside, you would have a flower pinned on your lapel, and once you wore this paper flower, no one would solicit you anymore. Although the flower sellers didn't force you to buy, passersby viewed it as a duty to be fulfilled. The amount of ten cents was not much for the giver, but over time, it would naturally accumulate into a considerable sum, which could be used for a significant purpose.

I believe that charitable organizations in various parts of the country can adopt this method, with the approval of local authorities, to raise funds for refugee relief or other charitable purposes. The "Friends of Wounded Soldiers" movement in the mainland has already been thriving for some time, but it has not yet been echoed in these coastal cities. We hope that all public organizations, charitable organizations, and churches will, in the spirit of humanity, work hard for the wounded soldiers. The above method is just a humble suggestion for reference.

### Establishing a Dwarf Kingdom

— Liu Li

A man named Youlikangde in Vienna, currently fifty years old and three feet six inches tall, is a famous dwarf. He runs a large store in Vienna, and as a result, he has contact with 50,000 to 60,000 dwarfs worldwide through purchasing goods. Mr. Kangde feels very unfair because dwarfs are often ridiculed by the world, so he plans to build a dwarf kingdom, gathering dwarfs from all over the world in one place. He has now sent out invitations to dwarfs all over the world to discuss this matter.

### Lishui, the Center of the Zhejiang Cooperative Movement

— Shen Cang

Lishui is a "mountainous" county located in the upper reaches of the Ou River in eastern Zhejiang, surrounded by mountains. It is more than three hundred miles away from both Wenzhou and Jinhua (with direct bus access). Before the War of Resistance, it lay quietly, unnoticed by people.

After "August 13th," many government agencies, schools, organizations, and "refugees" in Zhejiang Province moved back to the rear. Lishui, because it was a "mountainous" county with many mountains, became a "blessed land" that they considered safe. As a result, they all moved here, and its population jumped from 120,000 to more than 200,000. Rents also jumped from dozens of yuan a year to dozens of yuan a month. The narrow streets were crowded with pedestrians, so congested that water could hardly flow through.

After the fall of Hangzhou, it became even more lively here. Almost all the important agencies of the provincial government were concentrated here. At this time, some people called Lishui "Little Hangzhou." Indeed, at this time, Lishui could be worthy of this title. It had invisibly become the political, economic, and cultural center of Zhejiang Province. Lishui had been blessed with good fortune after the war!

Following the relocation of various agencies and organizations to Lishui, there was also a "Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative Affairs Promotion Association." It was a cooperative organization composed of personnel engaged in cooperative affairs throughout Zhejiang, dedicated to promoting cooperative affairs throughout Zhejiang. It had nearly a thousand members. After arriving in Lishui, they decided to use this uncultivated virgin land as the center to launch the cooperative movement throughout Zhejiang. They began to carry out preliminary pioneering work.

At this time, although Lishui already had the name "cooperative," when you stepped into the "cooperative" and asked, there was nothing there. The so-called "cooperative" was just a sign. Even a few merchants hung up a "cooperative" sign to avoid taxes. The public had no trust or interest in "cooperatives" at all. Everyone regarded "cooperatives" as a superfluous thing. At that time, the comrades of the "Cooperative Promotion Association" first set about organizing a relatively sound and well-funded "demonstration cooperative" in order to correct the public's discriminatory psychology towards cooperatives and enhance the reputation of "cooperatives." After several months of preparation, through the relationships of various agencies and organizations, they finally raised a considerable amount of share capital, and the Lishui Urban Area Consumer Cooperative, with a brand-new appearance, emerged. The cooperative was divided into several departments: boarding, food, daily necessities, grain, etc., resembling a department store. All organizations followed the cooperative law. After a few months, because the cooperative was well managed and did not experience the "loss" or "embezzlement" and other bad phenomena that had occurred in other cooperatives in the past, its "business" was booming. Thus, it broke the public's traditional negative view of cooperatives that "cooperatives will never be run well." It had left a very good impression of "cooperatives" on the people of Lishui, sowing the seeds of the cooperative movement in Lishui.

Under the active promotion of the "Cooperative Promotion Association," following the "Urban Area Consumer Cooperative," "Township Cooperatives" were established in urban areas and townships, and cooperatives became very common in urban areas. However, Lishui is a "mountainous county," and its economic foundation is entirely based on rural areas. The exploitation relationship is more complex and cruel than in urban areas. Solving the rural economic problem during the War of Resistance was an urgent matter. Therefore, cooperative workers actively went deep into the countryside to open up new gardens when the cooperative movement in Lishui's urban area had made some progress. However, due to the lack of cooperative cadres, the rural cooperative movement did not achieve good results. On the contrary, there were cases of cooperatives being manipulated by private individuals or a few people. However, this was just a phenomenon that was inevitable at the beginning of the cooperative movement, and it would slowly be overcome.

In addition to the "Urban Area Consumer Cooperative," "Township Cooperatives," and various rural cooperatives organized under the promotion of the "Cooperative Promotion Association" in Lishui, there were also two workers' production cooperatives (weaving cooperative and leather goods cooperative) established under the guidance of the "China Industrial Cooperative Association" (affiliated to the Executive Yuan). These two production cooperatives were purely organized by mountain production workers. There was no so-called exploitation relationship at all. The workers who joined these two cooperatives worked happily and frugally every day, for themselves, for the future of the cooperative cause, and for resisting the upward development of that secretive and unreasonable cannibalistic exploitation force!

Due to political reasons, Lishui has become the center of the Zhejiang cooperative movement today. However, the cooperative movement in Lishui has only had a very short history from the beginning to the present. It has not yet reached its "golden age" of "full prosperity." I believe that with the active support of the Zhejiang authorities and cooperative comrades throughout the province, the cooperative movement in Lishui will surely release a bright and brilliant light in the near future! —I wish her well—

### Excerpts of Condolence Couplets from All Walks of Life Mourning Mr. Cai Yuanpei

When the news of Mr. Cai Jiemin's death in Hong Kong arrived, the condolence couplets sent by all walks of life were dazzling and beautiful. Here are a few excerpts to give a glimpse: Zhang Fakui's couplet said: "Exemplary teacher, when the masses are in great need of education, alas, you have passed away riding a white crane"; "Hearing the sad news on the battlefield, it is a pity that the final victory is not far away, and you will not see the joyous drinking and destroying the Yellow Dragon." Yang Dezhao's couplet said: "Your articles and scholarship are admired throughout the country, tracing back thirty years of nurturing talent, recruiting all the talented people in the world"; "You enjoyed longevity and health, but could not rest in Lingnan, alas, you fell ill within one or two days, we all weep for the loss of a respected elder." Yu Hanmou said: "Your virtue and prestige are respected in the Confucian world, a towering figure, we all admire you like Han Yu"; "Your hard work benefits the Party and the country, the government and the public regret your passing, why need to posthumous titles like Wang Tong." Wu Tiecheng's couplet said: "Vast writings and profound scholarship, surpassing the ancients, in private life a great scholar, in public life a upright elder"; "Revolutionary achievements, loyal to the country, your kindness fills the world, sorrow fills the Central Plains." Wang Zhengting's couplet said: "As a senior, you are a great master, a beam and a mountain, a symbol of prestige"; "In a foreign land, we feel the loss of an elder, the plum blossoms on the distant island bring sadness to the new spring." Fang Zhenwu's couplet said: "A role model for people, Mr., you will surely have a place in the ancestral halls"; "Grieved by the national crisis, we, the survivors, will never forget the three generations of仇 [enemies]." Qian Yongming's couplet said: "Your noble integrity is as high as white clouds, for a hundred years of cultivating people, you have long had a model of preaching the way"; "Your achievements and fame are recorded in history, facing a few lines of your last writings, we cannot bear to hear the peach and plum trees weeping in the spring breeze." Ren Hongjun's couplet said: "Studying with a strict world view, treating others with a broad and selfless heart, opening up a prosperous era with bare hands, your teachings should be worshipped for a hundred generations"; "Singing the lyrics of 'Man Jiang Hong' against the war, leaving two words of entrustment to save the country, your spirit is extraordinary, the sorrow of not seeing the unity of Kyushu is left behind." Zhang Yilin said: "Following Gu Yanwu, Huang Lizhou, and Wang Er'nong as examples, reviving the ancestral style, Mr. did not see the Great Harmony, and with his last breath still held righteous arguments"; "Companioned by Plato, Gorky, and Wells, uniquely opening up new ground, we, the survivors, must not forget to continue the work, the nine springs can be used to rescue the illiterate."

What is most noteworthy is that Tao Xisheng, who recently left Shanghai for Hong Kong and published the Japanese-Wang agreement, also sent a condolence couplet to mourn Mr. Cai. His couplet said: "The great tree suddenly withers and falls, the thickets have no support, I fear that the strong wind will harm the delicate grass"; "The national仇 [hatred] is pressing, the hometown is not far away, yet I light incense and weep at the ancestral hall."

### Superstitions of Westerners

— Boyang

In addition to the taboo against the number "13" and the belief that Friday is an unlucky day, some superstitions of Westerners include avoiding walking under a ladder leaning against a wall, as it forms a triangle, reminding people of the Trinity in Christianity.

There are many superstitions in theaters, such as not humming tunes or singing in the dressing room, and it is unlucky to step out with the left foot first. In addition, going back to the dressing room to retrieve forgotten items and sitting on the back of a chair are all taboo.

Some people in the United States believe that a bride must hold an umbrella when she goes out for the first time, otherwise it is unlucky. A cradle cannot be rocked empty, otherwise the baby will not sleep peacefully.

The British say that cutting fingernails on Monday brings good news; cutting them on Tuesday brings new shoes; cutting them on Wednesday ensures good health; cutting them on Thursday brings wealth; cutting them on Friday brings marital bliss; cutting them on Saturday brings travel.

### New Medical Technique of Using Corpses to Treat Living People

— Fan Sun

In recent years, a new treatment technique has been discovered in European and American medicine, which is to use corpses to treat patients. Although this new treatment technique is still under research and improvement, its importance in medicine is self-evident, and it will make it possible to cure several diseases that were previously hopeless.

When a patient needs blood, doctors often use blood transfusions to inject other people's blood into their blood vessels. This is something that everyone already knows. However, recently, a Russian professor named Xue Nuofu and Yuding (Shanov (Vudin) have discovered a way to permanently preserve blood drawn from living people or even dead people. In this way, the new-style hospitals can pre-store various types of human blood for doctors to use at any time, instead of having to temporarily draw blood from healthy people and inject it into patients during blood transfusions.

Furthermore, according to expert reports, they have discovered the fact that human organs continue to live for a certain period of time after a person dies. The survival time varies from a few hours to several days. American scientists have been able to use the liver and kidneys cut from corpses to replace the liver and kidneys of patients.

According to the results of current research, the survival time of various organs after death is: brain, ten minutes; heart muscle, twenty minutes; eye, thirty minutes; ear, one hour; arm muscle, four hours; blood components, eighteen hours; bone, three days; skin, five days. In this way, in addition to storing human blood in hospitals, various organs can also be stored. If someone suffers from a dangerous disease and a certain organ must be replaced, the doctor can go to a hospital that stores this type of organ to find a suitable replacement organ. Perhaps in the future, there will be specialized hospitals for storing blood and organs.

### China Has Seventy-Five Species of Fleas — Not Including Those Yet to Be Discovered!

Natural scientists regard China as a new zoo, full of rare birds and animals. It is said that there are no less than one thousand four hundred and eighty-seven species of birds alone. Even fleas have seventy-five species that have already been discovered, and the rest are still being studied. This is what Mr. Sha Weibi said in his speech at the Asian Literary Association last month.

Some fleas have white abdomens, almost like maggots. According to Mr. Sha Weibi, every mammal has a special type of flea, although some are common to several animals. For example, the fleas on dogs are also found on cats and even on humans. The importance of fleas cannot be ignored, because many infectious diseases, such as the Black Death, are spread by them.

Flea specimens collected from all over China have been sent to Charles Rothschild, the world authority on flea research.

### The Most Intelligent Animals

— Qing

According to a recent report by Dr. White Lai, a New York animal instructor, the way a beast or insect behaves in the world is much smarter than humans. Bees can see ultraviolet radiation, dogs can smell all odors, and snakes can suck up their prey in the air. He also proposed ten of the smartest animals: 1. Chimpanzee, 2. Gorilla, 3. Elephant, 4. Orangutan, 5. Dog, 6. Beaver, 7. Horse, 8. Sea lion, 9. Bear, 10. Cat.

Why this arrangement? Dr. White Lai has his own reasons. His judgment is based on the creativity, memory, imitation ability, comprehension ability, and trainability of each type of animal.

He said: "If chimpanzees had as much contact with humans as dogs have had for thousands of years, I dare say that this kind of animal would have made great progress in intelligence today. Therefore, I put it in the first place. As for gorillas, because their mood is more mechanical and stubborn, they are ranked second."
