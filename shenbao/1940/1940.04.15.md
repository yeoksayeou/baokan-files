### Northeastern Representatives to Attend the Political Council

### Tianjin Silver Deposit Issue: Hope for Resolution

Chongqing, reliable foreign sources here anticipate that the Tianjin silver deposit issue can be resolved soon. However, there has been no official statement from the Chinese and British authorities regarding this matter to date. It is rumored that after the British side put forward conditions for a resolution, the Chinese and British authorities immediately began negotiations in Chongqing. However, this proposal was not accepted by the Chinese side. Several weeks later, the Chinese authorities put forward a counterproposal, which was discussed by the British and Japanese authorities in Tokyo. It is now heard that the venue for negotiations has been moved back to Chongqing. It is said that during the negotiations, the Chinese authorities expressed great understanding for the difficulties currently experienced by the United Kingdom in Tianjin. This reasonable attitude of the Chinese government has created a good impression among the British. The Tianjin silver deposit issue is related to other third countries, so the British side has kept the American and French governments informed of the progress of the negotiations in Chongqing and Tokyo. At present, everyone's attention is focused on whether the Japanese side will lift the blockade of the Tianjin concession after the negotiations are successfully concluded, as it is rumored that the Japanese side has made this promise. This can also test whether the silver deposit dispute is the real reason for the blockade of the concession, or merely an excuse for the Japanese side's actions. (Reuters Dispatch, 14th)

### One Week of War Situation

The spokesman for the Chongqing Military Commission stated that after Suiyuan West and Guinan, the brave soldiers of Northern Jiangxi have achieved another great victory in the past week, creating unprecedented results. The other fronts have also repeatedly reported victories, and the brave Chinese Air Force has continued to bomb Yueyang fiercely, inflicting unlimited blows on the Japanese. The important war situation is described as follows:

Northern Jiangxi: Since last week, the Japanese army began to stir, and China simultaneously launched a full-scale attack. The Japanese then breached the dikes south of Nanchang, hoping to prevent the Chinese advance. The main forces of the Chinese routes mobilized to attack the periphery of Nanchang, recapturing more than 20 important villages and towns in one fell swoop within two days. On the 8th and 9th, they recaptured the two major strongholds of Fengxin and Jing'an, surrounded Anyi, and the remaining Japanese troops collapsed and retreated towards Nanchang. The Chinese army bravely pursued, causing heavy losses to the Japanese. By the evening of the 12th, all the strongholds on the east side of Nanchang, Wuxi and Xiebu, the south side of Xianghua, and the west side of Xishan Wanshou Palace had been recaptured. Wanjia Village on the north side was also under fierce attack by the Chinese. After being surrounded on all sides, the Japanese were unable to advance or retreat, and their casualties reached more than 2,000 in recent days. They continued to strengthen their fortifications and engage in a stubborn defense. The victorious Chinese forces are gathering and shrinking the encirclement to annihilate them.

Guinan: The Japanese, after being severely defeated twice by the Chinese army, which surrounded and fiercely attacked them from the east and west sides of the Yulin Road, have recently gathered more than 5,000 remnant troops and, with the combined forces of land and air, advanced westward along both banks of the Zuojiang River from Nanning for the third time. The Japanese troops on the south bank crossed the Zuojiang River, and the Japanese troops on the north bank crossed the Qianjiang River, advancing blindly at risk. The Chinese army had made predetermined deployments. On one side, a large force first crossed the Zuojiang River and advanced behind the Japanese troops. On the other side, the Japanese were lured deeper into the valley area around Tongzheng County. Starting from the 8th, a heroic annihilation battle was launched on the southeast, northwest, southwest, and northwest sides of Tongzheng County and the southeast, southwest, and northwest sides of Zuojiang County. After a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese army completely collapsed. That night, the two places of Tongzheng and Zuojiang County were completely recaptured. Less than 3,000 of the surviving Japanese troops were intercepted and severely killed along the way, and their losses were even greater. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy and has approached the outskirts of Nanning.

Eastern Jin: The Chinese army, which had just launched an attack on Changzi and Jishan, fought fiercely for three days and nights. The Japanese troops retreated into the city and are being encircled and annihilated. The Japanese in Xinjiang, Wenxi, Anyi, Yicheng, Quwo, and other places are still being besieged, and their casualties are extremely high. In Anyi and Xinjiang alone, more than 1,000 Japanese troops have been annihilated. After being recaptured, the Chinese army in Lin County, Western Jin, took advantage of the victory to attack and continued to recapture the strongholds of Fangshan and Qikou, killing more than 1,200 Japanese troops.

Northern Henan: The Japanese troops besieged in Qinyang were fiercely attacked by the Chinese on the 10th and forced to reach the city walls, killing more than 500 Japanese troops. The Japanese continued to reinforce and attempted to defend to the death. Another Chinese army has been fiercely attacking for days.

Northern Hubei: In Zhongxiang, Jingshan, Yingcheng, and other places, a unit has approached the outskirts of Yingcheng. The Japanese barracks and warehouses were burned down. The Chinese army in Eastern Hubei has been advancing towards the outskirts of Hankou for days, has approached Macheng, and has annihilated more than a thousand Japanese troops. It is currently engaged in a fierce battle with more than 2,000 Japanese troops who are reinforcing and counterattacking.

Northern Hunan: The Chinese army attacking the outskirts of Yueyang once occupied Yunxi Railway Station at dawn on the 10th and rushed into Yanglousi Railway Station on the morning of the 12th.

Southern Hebei: Fierce battles have taken place in Daming, Linzhang, Wangguanying, Rizhao in Eastern Shandong, and Baoying in Northern Jiangsu, killing more than 1,700 Japanese troops and seizing countless spoils.

Western Zhejiang: They attacked Yuanhua Town and besieged Jiaxing, achieving great gains.

Southern Anhui: Over 40 Japanese warships were sunk, and over 500 Japanese troops were killed.

On the 12th, the Chinese Air Force, following the achievements of the 2nd, bombed Yueyang again, completely destroying the Japanese ammunition depot and sinking many Japanese warships on the shore of Dongting Lake. These were all important war events of the week. (13th Dispatch)

### Gansu Provincial Government Promotes Cotton Planting

Lanzhou, the land of Gansu Province is located on a plateau, but the climate and environment are suitable for cotton planting. In the past, because farmers did not know how to plant cotton, the province's cotton demand was supplied by Shaanxi Province. In recent years, with the advocacy of the local authorities, cotton planting has been tried in the Longnan area, and the results have been quite satisfactory. However, due to the small amount of cotton fields and the limited scenery, the provincial government has formulated a three-year plan to promote cotton planting in order to increase rear production. It has decided to start implementing it this year. It is planned to promote it in eleven counties, including Lanzhou, in the first year, with 30,000 mu of cotton fields; in thirteen counties, including Pingliang, in the second year, with 130,000 mu of cotton fields; and in thirteen counties, including Jingyuan, in the third year, with 340,000 mu of cotton fields. In total, 500,000 mu of cotton fields will be promoted in three years. (14th Dispatch)

### Japan's Future Strategy

According to Tokyo sources: The Japanese military department convened an important military meeting from the 7th to the 11th of this month, gathering major military leaders and their representatives from inside and outside the country. It is reported that issues such as strengthening unity, military-civilian cooperation, the goals of the war against China, and the Saito slip of the tongue case were discussed. The process and outcome of such a meeting are naturally not easily known to outsiders, and therefore it is difficult to make an accurate judgment. However, Japan's current movements should still focus on the China issue. In the military aspect, it is nothing more than carefully considering its invasion strategy after the recent launch of a political offensive. Just looking at this point and the several issues discussed at the above military conference, it is enough to show that this political offensive by the Japanese was a failed masterpiece.

Regardless of what kind of grand slogans and propaganda the Japanese authorities use regarding the invasion of China, its ultimate goal is nothing more than conquering China and enslaving China. This is something that anyone with even a little common sense can discern. Whether it is a military offensive, or an offensive in politics, diplomacy, or economics, it is nothing more than a means to achieve this goal. The Japanese warlords have no preference or aversion to various means, but choose and use them according to the times. Military offensives naturally require the most effort and the greatest sacrifice. Three years ago, they blindly used this as the main way to invade China, but in the recent year or so, it has proven impossible to achieve definite success, and it has become an excessive burden for the Japanese. As a result, the use of political means has replaced military deployments and has been placed in the important position of the front line. In fact, even from the perspective of Japanese domestic public opinion, this use has not been given a very high evaluation. At most, it is hoped that it can give war-weary Japanese soldiers and civilians a new vision. The actual gains have not only failed to match its past acts of aggression, not only failed to replace the tasks of the invading Japanese army, but have also increased its burden. If this offensive is being used by the Japanese as an excitement and anesthetic, then after this excitement and anesthesia, and the disappointment and fluctuations that follow, the already exhausted military strength and morale will inevitably become more decadent and fragile, and even the little combat standard that existed in the past will be difficult to maintain. Among the topics of this Tokyo military conference, it is said that promoting closer unity and close cooperation between the military and civilians are important items, which shows that the phenomenon of internal separation and disunity in Japan must have gradually surfaced, thus arousing the attention of its military center.

However, regardless of whether Japan's political offensive is maintained, abandoned, or how it is used, and regardless of how weak the Japanese military strength has become, after this military conference, the invading Japanese army will take another active action, which is expected. As for whether its movements will continue to seek to penetrate the interior, or prepare to defend stubbornly in the occupied areas, or defend the north and advance south, or turn to invade the north, all remain to be proven by facts. In general, according to past experience, none of the Japanese army's attempts to invade in the past year or so have been successful, and none have failed to suffer serious defeats. For example, the recent battles in Suiyuan West, Guinan, and Northern Jiangxi have all provided very clear examples. Even if the Japanese army changes its strategy in the future and concentrates its main force in one corner in order to achieve success, as far as the overall war situation is concerned, if the Japanese cannot greatly increase their troops, then even if they want to continue to commit internal crimes, they will ultimately achieve nothing. If only three or several divisions are added to the troops, it is only enough for short-term consumption. Examining various facts and situations, and trying to speculate, the future Japanese strategy will be to defend by attacking. It only seeks to form the points and lines it occupies into a plane. At most, it is nothing more than attempting to open up the north-south transportation trunk lines. Although it is a great question whether the strength of the Japanese will allow this attempt, its intention should not be more than this. Looking at the direction of Japanese development: recently, the Japanese warlords are eyeing the opportunity to take advantage of the expansion of the European war to invade the Western countries' territories in the South Pacific. It is also coordinating with its diplomatic offensive, both seeking to threaten China's anti-Japanese base in the southwest, and seeking to threaten China through international pressure and coerce Britain and France. Therefore, the sea and land strongholds occupied by the Japanese in China, Central China, and South China must be seen as the center of all military deployments, in order to create the foundation for its traditional southern advance policy. At the same time, although Japan's attempt to collude with the Soviet Union has failed, since the Soviet Union may not be involved in the vortex of the European war, Japan will not suddenly take on the role of a vanguard of the anti-Soviet crusade and engage in adventurous operations to the north. In summary, the issue of the goal of the war against China discussed at this Tokyo military conference was probably to re-estimate its remaining strength and seek to concentrate it on the so-called "mopping-up war" in the occupied areas, and to emphasize the maintenance and opening up of the dot-money in Central China and South China.

It has been widely reported that the Japanese army is shortening its front lines and stopping its offensive. Looking at the current situation, this is possible. Moreover, judging from the dispatch of troops to several locations on the Beijing-Shanghai line in the past three or four days, this has been partially confirmed. However, no matter how much the Japanese warlords emphasize their political offensive to deceive themselves, they must immediately relax their military application. Of course, even if the Japanese army blindly invades again, it will only create more new defeats. Even temporary anesthesia and excitement will eventually lead to weaker public morale and more blunt military strength, and eventually even the defensive posture will be impossible to maintain. However, as far as China is concerned, it should still be aware of Japan's recent deployments and mobilizations, and must be seriously prepared.

The relationship between China and Japan, even if it forms a tense war in all aspects of politics, diplomacy, and economics, its final gains and losses must still be clearly expressed from the military perspective. The arrangements in various aspects such as politics are nothing more than to assist and promote the implementation of military goals. The more a military force is struggling, the more urgent it is to open up other paths outside the military to alleviate its poverty. This fact, as well as the countless examples in the north-south battlefield for more than a year, have all exposed Japan's problems and hinted at the trend of the Sino-Japanese war.

### Dutch Queen Issues Order: Expands National Martial Law Area; Officialdom Simultaneously Declares Neutral Policy; Belgium Mustering Troops and Preparing for Contingencies

The martial law order declared in many parts of central, western, and frozen southern Netherlands was extended last night to the south, east, and north. Official announcements said that some foreign newspapers were moved by the remarks made by the British and French parliaments regarding neutral countries. They are now saying that neutral countries may have reached prior compromises with the Allied Powers so that the Allied Powers can provide assistance in the event of an external attack. It should be known that the Dutch government has adopted an unshakeable and unambitious neutral policy from the beginning, and will continue to maintain it in the future. In this policy, there is no room for prior agreement with any belligerent country. (Reuters Dispatch, 14th)

Hague, according to official announcements here, the Dutch Queen issued an edict last night to expand the national martial law area, including the northern and northeastern provinces. The central, western, and southwestern provinces have been under martial law since November 1, 1939. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 14th)

Brussels, the atmosphere here has gradually become tense in the past three days. Although the government's neutral policy has not changed, the whole country is now mustering troops and preparing for contingencies. All administrative offices and radio stations are now guarded by troops. The state of alert implemented during the tension in January has now been restored. (Reuters Dispatch, 14th)

This afternoon, the King of Belgium received Prime Minister Pierre-Henri Spaak, Foreign Minister Spart, and Minister of National Defense Denis, and also accepted the credentials presented by the new Norwegian Minister to Belgium, Hoen. (Haitong Dispatch, 14th)

Berlin, German officials paid close attention to the American report that British troops will land in the Netherlands, and they considered this to be a countermeasure by Britain against Germany's landing in Norway. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 14th)

London, responsible parties stated that the German side has now issued rumors that the Allied Powers intend to destroy Dutch neutrality. This statement is absurd and ridiculous, and no one outside Germany will be deceived by it. (Reuters Dispatch, 14th)

London, the US authorities have issued a notice to British expatriates in the Netherlands, stating that "to prevent problems before they happen," they should prepare to leave the country at any time. All British expatriates should prepare hand luggage and go directly to the British consulates in Amsterdam or Rotterdam once German troops invade the Netherlands. (United Press Dispatch, 14th)

### Japan's Ambition to Annex Dutch East Indies Increasingly Revealed

Tokyo, Today's News: Japan has been paying close attention to the European situation, particularly whether the Netherlands will be drawn into the war. According to informed sources, the Japanese government believes that if the Netherlands becomes involved, it will inevitably affect the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese government is considering declaring to other countries its intention to prevent the war from spreading to the Western Pacific. It is also preparing to take reciprocal measures if other countries do not heed its declaration. This warning from Japan will be delivered to foreign envoys by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or to foreign governments by Japanese envoys abroad. Local officials are keeping silent about foreign news reports that Japan might occupy the Dutch East Indies if the Netherlands joins the European war. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Chuo Commercial News, and other newspapers have been speculating on the future of the Dutch East Indies. In recent days, they have used large headlines to speculate on Japan's attitude toward preventing the spread of war to Nanyang, where Japan has mandated territories. The Asahi Shimbun reports that the Japanese government will adhere to a policy of non-interference in the European war and will devote all its efforts to Chinese affairs. However, Japan is closely watching the development of the European situation and does not want to see the war spread to the South Pacific region. Therefore, the Japanese government is considering plans to deal with any eventuality. However, if Japan decides to deal with the situation caused by the Dutch East Indies being drawn into the whirlpool of war, it will try to avoid being misunderstood by third countries. Therefore, Japan should ask our country to pay attention to this matter and express its desire to urge the belligerent countries and other countries concerned to do their best to prevent the war from spreading to the South Pacific. This step may be taken through the diplomatic representatives of the belligerent countries and other countries concerned in Tokyo or through the Japanese diplomatic representatives abroad, depending on the situation. The Asahi Shimbun also analyzes the war situation in Europe, saying that as a result of Germany's actions in Northern Europe, the future development of the war will be a struggle between Britain and Germany for influence in the Netherlands. For this reason, the situation on the German-Dutch border has recently become very tense. If the Netherlands unfortunately falls into the whirlpool of war, the entry of foreign armed forces, whether British or German, will immediately raise the question of whether the Dutch East Indies should fight. Japan has close economic ties with the Dutch East Indies and must pay close attention to the possible developments there. Europe is now making three different speculations about the future of the Dutch East Indies: (1) the territory will become a British protectorate or be temporarily placed under British rule; (2) the Dutch government may move to the territory; (3) the territory will ask the United States for protection. Japan is now adhering to a policy of not participating in the European war and does not want the war to spread to the East. The participation of Yilan has caused changes in the political union or political division of the Dutch East Indies. Although the United States authorities have tried to avoid explicitly stating their attitude towards the German invasion of Denmark, President Roosevelt is now very concerned about the status of Greenland. The United States and Qing also believe that Greenland should separate from Europe and join the American continent, and then the United States will protect it through the Monroe Doctrine. In this situation, Japan is now striving to take appropriate steps to prevent the Dutch East Indies from participating in the European war, so as to avoid the war from affecting the East. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Boli Gov, a famous news reporter in Beijing who has close ties with Churchill, published an article in Antwerp yesterday, claiming that, according to British opinion, there should be no neutrality in Europe today. Germany's neutral neighbors should accept the control of the Allied countries. Anyone who refuses should accept the consequences of war. Boli pointed out that the situation in the Netherlands and Belgium is the most difficult. Both countries are weak and have vast colonies. Britain and France have the responsibility to protect all colonies during the war. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 14th)

### Pan-American Union 50th Anniversary United States to Hold Celebrations

### Australia Strictly Restricting Imports of Goods Outside the Sterling Bloc Japan Has a Stockpile of 900 Million Square Yards of Cotton Goods Ministry of Foreign Affairs Anxious About Retaliatory Threats

Tokyo, according to the Asahi Shimbun, the Australian Federal Government of the British Commonwealth is increasingly restricting imports of goods from countries outside the Sterling Bloc. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very concerned about this situation and has instructed Consul-General Ichikawa in Sydney to notify the Australian government that such measures are sufficient to cause Japan to take retaliatory measures. According to the various control measures taken by the Australian government, no impact has yet occurred on Japanese goods, but in the future the scope will be expanded to restrict Japanese cotton yarn and rayon, and it is possible that other British territories will follow Australia's lead and take the same measures. If so, Japanese goods are in danger of being completely excluded. Since the outbreak of the European war, Britain has severely restricted imports in order to fully maintain its foreign exchange and import various necessary food and raw materials. The autonomous territories have been able to cooperate closely with it. Until recently, Japan protested to the Australian government for reducing the quantity of wool exported to Japan, but without effect. It is doubtful what effect this second protest will have. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Tokyo, in the first quarter of this year, Japan's exports of cotton goods to countries outside the Japanese yen bloc exceeded 10.1 million yen in value, an increase of 23.3% over the previous quarter. However, in terms of quantity, it was 49.7 million square yards, a decrease of 5.8% compared with the previous quarter. Many of the goods that were originally planned to be shipped in December of last year were not shipped until January of this year. At the end of the first quarter of this year, there was a stockpile of 900 million square yards of cotton goods, which is an unprecedented high number. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the export situation in the second quarter of this year is not good. It is expected that if no measures are taken to clear the backlog, the cotton goods inventory will continue to increase by 400 million to 500 million square yards between April and August. The Japan Cotton Spinning Association believes that the only solution is to reduce cotton production. The Asahi Shimbun believes that there is another solution, which is to transport part of the inventory to Japanese yen bloc countries, such as Manchuria and North China, where market prices are higher. Exporters and cotton mills have long had this intention, but the Japanese government has prohibited it two years ago because it hinders exports to non-yen bloc countries and interrupts the supply of foreign currency that the Japanese government considers necessary. The Asahi Shimbun also said that foreign cotton goods inventories are higher than in previous years, because speculators expect prices to rise and rush to purchase and store, resulting in purchases exceeding actual needs. The strengthening of British and French controls on Japanese cotton goods will also greatly reduce the import of Japanese cotton goods. Therefore, the export of Japanese cotton goods will continue to decline in the future. The hoarding of Japanese cloth by merchants in China, and the change to local products by those who purchase Japanese goods in Central and South America and the British Commonwealth, are also reasons why the export of Japanese cotton goods will not be strong in the future.

### Soviet-Japanese Trade Treaty Negotiations Have Stalled Japanese Delegation Leaves Soviet Union for Sweden Matsushima Refuses to Disclose Results of Negotiations

Moscow, Matsushima, the head of the Japanese trade delegation, left here last night for Stockholm, Sweden. The other six members of the delegation will also follow soon. The Japanese trade delegation has been here since January 4 for trade treaty negotiations. Mr. Matsushima and the local authorities refused to disclose the results of the negotiations, and they made no statement as to whether the Japanese ambassador to Moscow, Togo, will continue the negotiations after the delegation leaves. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Moscow, the Soviet-Japanese negotiations have not yielded any results. Matsushima has now been appointed as the ambassador to Sweden and left for Stockholm yesterday. At the same time, other members of the delegation have also left Russia and returned home. It is widely believed that the Soviet-Japanese economic negotiations have been decisively broken due to numerous difficulties and the inability to continue. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 14th)

### Roosevelt Issues Proclamation Condemning German Invasion of Denmark and Norway Neighboring Countries' Sovereignty and Territory Should Be Respected United States Deeply Abhors Violent Acts Will Not Allow Germany to Plant Influence in Greenland

Washington, President Roosevelt issued a document today, condemning the invasion of Norway and Denmark, stating that the US government has expressed its condemnation of this illegal use of force. It is further clarified the views on such actions, as in order to preserve civilization, the rights of weak countries to independence and territorial integrity and self-government opportunities must be respected by their stronger neighbors. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Washington, after the European war expanded to the Scandinavian Peninsula, although the United States condemned Germany's invasion of Norway and Denmark, it may not take any action or change its foreign policy. The general opinion of responsible parties in Washington can be summarized as follows: Since the Finnish problem failed to cause the intervention of the United States, other events will not cause the United States to take the field, at least during this presidential election. However, President Roosevelt has immediately issued a proclamation to protect the rights of Americans in the war zone, expanding the war zone stipulated in the Neutrality Act to the seas around the Scandinavian Peninsula and some Arctic Ocean ports of the Soviet Union. In the past, American ships were not allowed to call at ports in southern Norway or the Baltic Sea, but they could still anchor in Bergen or other northern ports. Now, according to the new regulations, the only points that American ships can reach are Portugal and northern Spain and neutral ports in the Mediterranean. The United States' huge financial interests in Scandinavia are now in danger. According to the State Department, American long-term investments that are endangered by the German invasion of Scandinavia are estimated at 25 million pounds for Denmark, 23 million pounds for Norway, and 8.5 million pounds for Sweden. Although American isolationists sympathize with the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula and regret the loss of American trade, they are still working to promote the United States' withdrawal from the war. Most people in Congress advocate maintaining a calm mind and not taking action. Representative Hill, one of the leaders of the Washington isolationists, recently said, "Although I admit that Germany's recent actions are a major blow to democraticism itself, I still oppose the United States joining the war." However, if Germany takes any action toward Greenland and wants to plant air force bases there, the US authorities may change their attitude. If Germany does so, the Allies will resist and the war will be closer to the United States. If Hitler expands his aggression in the Scandinavian Peninsula to Greenland and Iceland, what will the US policy be? President Roosevelt does not want to make any announcements on this point. However, the US president's concern about Greenland was seen yesterday when he hosted news reporters. At that time, the US president stated that he had asked the Red Cross to pay attention to the needs of the 17,000 residents of Greenland when Danish supplies were interrupted. The "New York Post" published an article by Platter, a well-known American expert, saying that for self-defense, the United States cannot safely watch a violent and tyrannical country such as Germany planting its influence in Iceland and Greenland. The "Springfield Republican" advocates that Canada should take over Greenland, which is more appropriate than the United States taking it over. Its intention is probably to prevent the United States from joining the war. However, the "Baltimore Sun" said that if Germany has any demands on Greenland or Iceland, it will inevitably cause the most serious problem under the Monroe Doctrine. The most serious aspect of new developments, from the American point of view, is probably here. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Greenland's Cryolite Is an Important Mineral for Military Use British Urge Early Control

London, metallurgists here told the press yesterday that Britain and France should implement a plan to strictly control Greenland shipping as soon as possible, and should not miss the opportunity. The cryolite produced in Greenland is an important item for military applications. The manufacture of aluminum cannot be done without this mineral, and the only place in the world that produces cryolite is Ivigtut in Greenland. Last year, a total of 30,000 tons of cryolite were exported from Ivigtut. The United States and Germany each accounted for 12,000 tons of this amount. If the above-mentioned estimate is accurate, then Germany has obtained enough for one year's use. Germany has spent many years trying to manufacture this cryolite, but the output is very small and the cost is very high. It is better to seek natural products. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

### American Newspapers Write Articles Commenting on the European Situation

New York newspapers have given great coverage to the British navy's victory in Narvik, and have also published articles discussing Germany's mess in the recent developments in Europe. The newspapers also state that the government will not deviate from the extremely cautious policy of not interfering in the European war in any way, especially because the presidential election will be held soon. A New York Times' Washington correspondent said that the general mood now is that although the country's policy has not changed due to the spread of the war, it is paying more attention to the development of the European situation than before. A New York dispatch said, "The fate of Greenland has brought the war closer to home. If the Netherlands is invaded, the fate of Curaçao and the Dutch East Indies will bring the war within striking distance of our main defenses." Today, as in 1917, the people are afraid of the thought of participating in the war, but the United States must deal with the possibility of the event, that is, the United States may be forced to join the war as the only way to protect its interests. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Britain and France Order the Latest Bombers from the United States

Washington, Britain and France have obtained the permission of the US Department of the Army to order new twin-engine Douglas bombers from the US. It is widely believed that this type of aircraft can fly 400 miles per hour and is the fastest of the Douglas aircraft in the world. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### American Ships Free Navigation in Northern Europe United States Makes Demands to Britain and Germany

Washington, the US Ambassador to Britain and the Minister to Norway have, according to the US intelligence conference yesterday, requested Britain and Germany to allow American ships to navigate freely and protect them in Scandinavian seaports, without interference from any warships, according to Secretary of State Hull. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 14th)

Washington, the US government is now urging Britain, Germany, and Norway to allow the three US ships currently in Norwegian ports to return to their country. The three ships are the Flying Fish and the McCormick, both of which are currently in Bergen, and the Mormacsea, which is currently in Trondheim. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Canada Prohibits Trade with Denmark

Ottawa, the Canadian Federal Government issued an order today stating that since Denmark has been occupied by German forces, it should technically be regarded as an enemy country. Therefore, the law prohibiting people from trading with enemy countries should be applied to that country from today. All commercial and financial transactions are prohibited. However, the Danish Faroe Islands (which have been occupied by Britain) and Greenland have not fallen and can still trade with the country as usual. In addition, it is hoped that domestic merchants will be particularly cautious when trading with Norway. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Italy Watches and Changes with the Wind

Rome, foreign observers here recently stated that if Britain and France only use naval and air forces to fight in Norway and allow German forces to remain in Norway, Italian public opinion will believe that this situation is sufficient to enhance Germany's military strategic position, and thus believe that the German army is indeed invincible. Italian public opinion has not clearly endorsed Germany in general, but because Italy suffered from sanctions imposed by Britain and France during the Abyssinian War, and Britain sent a fleet into the Mediterranean at that time, the Italian people are still resentful of Britain, but their admiration for the power of the British navy remains the same. It will only be after Britain has lost its prestige at sea that it may come out to assist Germany in interfering in the European war. If Britain and France cannot prevent Germany from interfering in Norway, they will not be able to effectively prevent Italy from blocking the Strait of Otranto (between Italy and Yugoslavia) and occupying the small islands belonging to Greece. Italy has been deliberately planning this matter for a long time, and all preparations have been completed, but it will not take any action until Britain and France and Germany decide the outcome. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Soviet-Lithuanian Border Demarcation Work Completed New Soviet-Finnish Border Also Demarcated

Moscow, the Central Mixed Committee for the Demarcation of the Soviet-Lithuanian Border recently issued an announcement stating that the work on the Demarcation of the Soviet-Lithuanian Border was completed in March 1940. The entire border is 370 kilometers long, with 609 border markers and 1,218 border pillars. Most of the surveying work on the border has also been completed. (TASS dispatch, 14th)

Helsinki, the Soviet-Finnish Border Demarcation Committee completed its task yesterday and demarcated the new border. According to Finnish political figures, Finland can accept the provisions of this new border. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

### Germany Asks for Passage Soviet Union Did Not Approve

Moscow, the British Daily Telegraph and Morning Post, and a Lithuanian newspaper, recently reported that German troops had been transported from Germany to Murmansk long ago, and recently transported from Murmansk to Narvik. TASS recently issued a solemn statement authorized by the government that this report is absolutely untrue and contains provocative content. (TASS dispatch, 14th)

Stockholm, the Lithuanian Times here recently published a message from the Lithuanian capital stating that the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, had requested Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to allow German warships to use the Soviet port of Murmansk and the railway from Leningrad to Murmansk, but the Soviet authorities refused in order to avoid being involved in the war in Northern Europe.

### Norwegian Northern Waters: Unprecedented Naval Battle Between British and German Forces; London Gazette Claims Seven German Ships Sunk; At Least Three British Destroyers Damaged

London, British Admiralty announced last night: Since the British Second Destroyer Flotilla attacked German destroyers in Narvik Bay on Wednesday, the British ships have blockaded the enemy ships in Narvik Bay. Today, at noon, the British battleship "Warspite" (31,000 tons) led several destroyers deep into the bay to attack the German destroyers. Several of them have been damaged, and they bombarded the shore batteries, as it was reported that batteries had been built ashore. This battle was extremely successful, and the enemy's resistance was not severe. The land howitzers erected on the shore were destroyed by the British naval gunfire. Four German destroyers were destroyed and sunk in Narvik Bay, and the other three fled into the 8-9 mile long Djupvik fjord behind the town of Narvik, but were also pursued and destroyed by the British ships. When this communiqué was issued, the Admiralty was still not certain of the situation in Narvik, but many people, mostly German soldiers, had fled from the town and escaped over the mountains. All the details are not yet known. Although seven enemy ships were destroyed, the British side was not without losses. Three British destroyers were damaged during the battle, but the injuries were not serious. The loss of British lives is estimated to be significant. The German loss of life cannot be estimated at present, but the seven destroyers must have carried more than a thousand sailors. The Admiralty has sent telegrams to congratulate the officers and soldiers who contributed to this battle, as it can clarify the situation in a part of the Norwegian coast. The war is still in progress. (Reuters, 14th)

Berlin, German High Command communiqué stated: The Battle of Narvik was a serious battle. It said that the British navy participating in yesterday's attack included two battleships, two aircraft carriers, and two cruisers, as well as a large number of destroyers. German destroyers attacked the superior British forces. The British destroyer "Cossack" caught fire and ran aground. The British destroyer "Eskimo" and several other ships were heavily damaged or destroyed. The German losses were not listed. The communiqué also stated that a German submarine had sunk a British Glasgow-class cruiser north of Shetland, and that German destroyer boats had destroyed three British submarines in Skagerrak. (Reuters, 14th)

Berlin, the Propaganda Ministry told the press last night that they had not yet received any reports of yesterday's naval battle in Narvik. As for the news issued by the British Admiralty that British ships had sunk seven German destroyers, the Propaganda Ministry refused to comment. (United Press, 14th)

London, the British fleet sank as many as seven German destroyers in the waters off Narvik Harbor yesterday. People in charge here have commented on this, saying that this major victory has become the pivot for a sudden turn in the Nordic war situation. In one day, the British navy was able to sink all of the German destroyers in Narvik Harbor. Germany only has 30 destroyers, all of which are the latest models, but since the outbreak of the Nordic war, it has lost as many as ten in four or five days. It can be seen that yesterday's battle of Narvik was a major defeat for the German navy. The British and French fleets now control the waters off Narvik Harbor, so it is extremely convenient for the British and French expeditionary forces to land there. (Havas, 14th)

### British Air Force Bombs Stavanger Airport, Dropping Heavy Bombs Causing Significant Damage; German Aircraft Engage in Combat, One Shot Down

London, the British Air Ministry claimed that yesterday morning, the British coastal aircraft squadron dropped a large number of bombs on Stavanger Airport, causing significant damage to the aircraft and facilities. A British aircraft was attacked by an enemy twin-engine fighter. The enemy bullets were fired repeatedly and at close range. Although the British aircraft was damaged, the tail gunner continued to fight back until the enemy aircraft caught fire and crashed. (Reuters, 14th)

London, British aircraft formations engaged in aerial combat with German aircraft formations in Norway today, immediately shooting down and damaging one German aircraft each. Both of these aircraft were German Messerschmitt 110s, the latest military aircraft in the country. (Havas, 13th)

A British reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire in Narvik, and another British aircraft was shot down in an aerial battle south of the city. (Haitong, 14th)

Berlin, yesterday nine British aircraft bombed Narvik Harbor. According to neutral observers, the British aircraft dropped bombs too hastily, so most of them did not hit the target. Only one bomb hit near the barracks, injuring three German soldiers. The aircraft was then shot down into the sea by German anti-aircraft fire. (Haitong, 14th)

### The Sinking of the British Ship "York" Is Unconfirmed by London

### Norwegian Destroyer Sinks German Transport Ship; 67 Germans Captured

Stockholm, according to news from the Norwegian news agency, the Norwegian destroyer "Torbjørn" reported to the British Admiralty that it had sunk a German transport ship near Hoggesund. The destroyer initially sent personnel to board the transport ship and open its seacocks, but because a German aircraft bombed it, it was unsuccessful. The destroyer sailed away, but the seacocks were destroyed by German aircraft. The ship then returned, captured 67 Germans on the transport ship, and then fired and sank the transport ship before joining the British fleet in Scapa Flow. The captured German prisoners have now been handed over to the British for detention. (Reuters, 14th)

### German Reinforcements Invading Norway Are Advancing Towards the Swedish Border; Consolidating the Gateway to Oslo; The Town of Halden is Occupied

Stockholm, according to news received here, German troops are landing on the southern coast of Norway at Skjeberg in a steady stream and are actively advancing towards the Swedish border. Yesterday at noon, they had already reached Lakseda. (Haitong, 14th)

Berlin, according to official claims, German heavy artillery units have arrived in Trondheim to reinforce Norway's artillery positions. (Haitong, 14th)

Copenhagen, according to a broadcast from Oslo received here, more German troops continued to arrive in Oslo from Denmark yesterday. (Haitong, 14th)

Stockholm, this morning's "Dagens Nyheter" reported that the Fredriksten Fortress and the nearby town of Halden were occupied by German troops yesterday without resistance. The former is the gateway to the Oslofjord, and the latter is an important Norwegian station along the Oslo-Gothenburg railway line. (Haitong, 14th)

Stockholm, last night a local newspaper claimed that German and Norwegian troops fought fiercely northeast of Oslo in Kongsvinger yesterday. German bombers also attacked Norwegian troops north of Oslo. The fighting was particularly fierce in the Vormsund area near Kongsvinger, and extended to the Arne area within Oslo. The German air offensive was concentrated on Eidsvoll. Yesterday, a spokesman for the Norwegian legation here said that the Norwegian troops and volunteers, although aware that German troops had landed, were still defending the Salten of the Oslofjord. The Norwegian flag is still flying on the strong Norwegian artillery positions near Fredriksten. The spokesman added that the number of German troops landing in Trondheim was not large, and that the German troops had access to the roads along the Trondheimsfjord at Storen, and he denied the rumor that Norway and Germany had reopened negotiations. (United Press, 14th)

Stockholm, according to news from the Norwegian front, after the fall of the city of Fredrikstad, the country's troops automatically abandoned the city of Halden, retreated to the east bank of the Glomma River, and continued to resist. Before the fall of Fredrikstad, it was said that it had been heavily bombed by German aircraft and strafed by machine guns, resulting in heavy casualties. However, the fighting in the area is still in progress. A summary of the situation in various places is as follows: (1) In the area of Rømskog, the two sides made contact in the morning and were still fighting fiercely until late at night. The Norwegian army resisted quite successfully. (2) In the area of Sarpsborg (northwest of Halden), Nazi Party activists were active and sent signals at night, notifying the German army of the location of the Norwegian army. A Norwegian army officer was also arrested by the military authorities for taking measures "sufficient to hinder mobilization." (3) In the area of Kongsvinger (48 miles northeast of Oslo), the evacuation of civilians has been completed, and the local situation is still calm. However, a fierce battle took place in the town of Eidsvoll, northwest of the city, this afternoon. According to the Swedish "Dagens Telegram", German troops are attacking Norwegian troops from Lillestrøm (east of Oslo) in the direction of Kongsvinger, attempting to cut off transportation between Norway and Sweden. (4) In the area of Oslo, the entire line from Halden in the southeast, via Mysen, Årnes, to Eidsvoll, is under German control. However, the German troops' attempt to cross the Vorma River has not yet succeeded. (Havas, 13th)

### Nazi Party Activities in Sweden Reveal Ambitions; If Swedish Neutrality is Violated, Britain Will Provide Full Assistance

Paris, according to responsible sources here, the Allied Powers have decided that if Sweden is invaded by Germany, the Allied Powers will provide Sweden with full assistance. (Reuters, 14th)

Stockholm, the Social Democratic newspaper recently reported that Nazi Party members are actively active in Sweden. A former military officer came here from Boden to recruit unemployed workers, paying them one and a half kronor (Swedish currency) per day, attempting to form some kind of group. The police authorities arrested him and found many propaganda materials in his residence. (Havas, 14th)

Paris, well-informed sources here said that the German Propaganda Ministry often gave speeches to Swedish journalists on this day, claiming that the intention of the British and French to lay mines in the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits was to change Germany's position with respect to Sweden. From this statement, Hitler's ambitions for Sweden have been revealed. At this point, whether Sweden's neutral status can be maintained depends on the intention of the German High Command. If Germany cannot transport personnel and supplies to Norway by sea, it will have to pass through Sweden and transport them by land. This has also been hinted at by German political figures, who said that if transporting personnel to Norway by air is insufficient in the future, they should request that Sweden allow them to transport guns and ammunition through the country's railways. Regarding this matter, Swedish Prime Minister Hansson delivered a nationwide broadcast speech yesterday, reiterating his determination to maintain neutrality and forcefully stating that if other countries violate its neutrality by force, it will resolutely resist it. Any neutral country that allows the personnel and military supplies of belligerent countries to pass through its territory will no longer be a neutral country. In short, the German propaganda authorities obviously want to put pressure on public opinion in the country before the government officially makes a request to Sweden, but this strategy has long been anticipated by the Swedish authorities and will eventually fail. (Havas, 12th)

### German Military Commander's "Three Laws" for Norwegians: Disobedience Means Death, Death, Death

Oslo, General Falkenhorst, the commander of the German troops in Oslo, delivered a broadcast speech to the Norwegian people today, stating that the German troops came to protect Norway from invasion by the Western powers. "We have extended our hand to the Norwegian people, and we hope that you will all accept our kindness. If you allow us to complete our mission without hindering us, our actions will naturally be calm and peaceful, as we did in Denmark. Otherwise, we will have to take strict and rude measures." Now, I tell you, anyone who attempts to sabotage transportation facilities will die; anyone who carries weapons will die; anyone who conspires to resist the government and damage the interests of the country will die; anyone who enlists in the military in accordance with the mobilization order of the Nygaardsvold government (referring to the legitimate government of Norway) will die. In a word, we want to live in peace with our neighbors. The Danish people deeply understand this intention, so they warmly welcome our troops, which is very grateful. (Havas, 13th)

### German Military's Future Strategy in Norway

Paris, military figures here said that the future route of the German troops will be no more than three: one will proceed to the Swedish border, two will advance along the railway lines from Oslo and Trondheim, and three will proceed to the port of Bergen. The number of troops currently operating in Norway is about 15,000. (Havas, 14th)

### Britain and France Guarantee Norway Immediate and Effective Assistance; British King Expresses Admiration for the Steadfast and Brave Spirit of Norway's Government and People in Telegram to Norwegian King

Stockholm, according to news from Norway, the Norwegian government has received a firm guarantee from the British and French governments that they will provide immediate and effective assistance, and that the necessary troops will soon land in Norway. (Reuters, 14th)

London, British King George telegraphed the Norwegian King, saying that Germany, with its pre-arranged tyrannical actions, has extended the war to your country. At this critical moment, I would like to express my own and the entire country's admiration for the glorious, brave, and steadfast actions of your government and people. I can assure you that the British and French governments are now providing Norway with all the assistance they can, so that the Allied forces fighting alongside the Norwegian people can prove that Germany's recent atrocities are not only cruel but also reckless. (Reuters, 14th)

### British Military Officer Tells Norwegians How to Resist the Enemy: Persist in Resistance to Await Assistance

London, a general who once served as the British military attaché in Oslo recently broadcasted from London, telling the Norwegian people that the best way to stop the German troops from advancing is that the Allied forces are now coming quickly to help, and the Norwegian people should hold their ground and not retreat. There are five ways for the Norwegian people to resist the enemy: (1) Report the details of the movement of German troops, ships, and aircraft to the nearest Norwegian or British military headquarters. (2) Follow the instructions of the Allied commander and cut off telephone lines. (3) Chop down trees and demolish bridges to block roads departing from German-occupied territories. (4) Move all automobiles, trucks, carts, and horses to prevent them from being acquired by the Germans. (5) Help demolish the railways connected to the bases occupied by the enemy forces. (Reuters, 14th)

### German Occupation of Denmark; Experiences of British, French, and Polish Diplomats; Safe Return Home Via The Hague

The Hague, one hundred and eighty British, French, and Polish diplomatic personnel recently arrived here from Copenhagen via Denmark. According to their eyewitness accounts of the German occupation of Denmark, it is estimated that 70,000 German troops passed through Copenhagen in the past two days. The British Minister to Denmark, Smith, is also among this group. Smith was detained by German troops on April 9th for several hours. According to a female staff member of the Soviet legation, the arrival of the event was unexpected. German troops occupied the city at 8 o'clock, initially only a large team, with 50 bombers. They scattered leaflets in the air to inform residents of the changes that had taken place. "I rushed to the embassy and rang the doorbell. After the door opened, two German soldiers in full armor stood in front of me. Later, the German army detained a beer truck and carried the British Embassy staff to a fortress. The British Minister was spared the humiliation of being loaded into the truck and traveled by car. We were all detained until the afternoon before being released and had some freedom." According to another embassy official, they were fortunate to have time to burn all the codes before the arrival of the German troops. According to general eyewitnesses, the Danish people seemed to be dazzled by this unexpected change. Although their attitude was quite calm, they had no idea how to deal with the situation. The remaining diplomatic personnel took a train across the German border. (Reuters, 14th)

### British Trade Relations with Nordic Countries

Amsterdam, according to official statistics on British international trade, the goods imported by Britain from the Nordic countries in 1938 are as follows: The percentage of British imports in the total exports of the Nordic countries in 1938 is as follows: Denmark 56.1, Norway 24.7, Sweden 23.1.

The percentage of British imports in the total exports of Norway and Sweden is lower, but it is still the first. The main exports of Denmark and Sweden are food, butter, eggs, and cured meat. In 1938, Britain imported 14,300,000 pounds of butter, 17,000,000 pounds of cured meat, and 48,000,000 pounds of eggs from Denmark and Sweden. In 1938, Britain imported 65,000 to 75,000 pigs from Denmark every week, accounting for 65% of the total pork imports. In addition, British imports of Danish poultry accounted for 27% of the total imports. Domestic products account for only 25% of the food consumed in Britain. British production of butter accounts for only 9% of total consumption, with the remaining 91% relying on foreign supply, and the Nordic countries supply 33%. It is difficult to imagine the great impact of Britain losing the supply from the Nordic countries. Britain is also experiencing the same impact in terms of raw materials. The raw materials imported by Britain from Sweden and Norway are as follows:

### Earthquakes and Floods in Turkey

Ankara, in the areas of central and northern Anatolia that experienced severe earthquakes last December, severe earthquakes have been felt intermittently in the past 24 hours. Earthquakes have also occurred in Ankara. Except for six deaths and 80 houses collapsed in Cifte, the damage is said to be minor. Terrified residents fled to the fields, all fearing that the recent disaster would be repeated. (Reuters, 14th)

Istanbul, a vast area of eastern Anatolia, Turkey, has been flooded due to flash floods. It is reported that many houses have been washed away, but fortunately only five people have drowned so far. (Haitong, 14th)

### New Minefield Laid by British in Baltic Sea, Blocking Sweden's Iron Ore Route to Germany; Germany Also Laying Mines in Belt Straits

London, the Admiralty announced that mines have been laid in the Baltic Sea and its entrances, with the exception of Swedish territorial waters. This mining operation was completed this morning. Sources in London pointed out that this new minefield will be another major obstacle to Sweden's iron ore route to Germany. (Reuters, 14th)

London, the Admiralty announced that we have laid a minefield in the Baltic Sea, extending east and west from 10 degrees east longitude (the east coast of Jutland, Denmark) to 21 degrees east longitude (the west coast of Latvia and Lithuania), and north and south from 55 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to 57 degrees north latitude. The sea surface within this boundary is full of mines, making navigation dangerous. Merchant ships of all countries must avoid it, but mines have not been laid in Swedish territorial waters. (Havas, 14th)

Berlin, an official document here stated that mines have been laid in the Great and Little Belt Straits. The total area where mines have been laid is as follows: (1) In the Great Belt Strait, between 55.17 degrees north latitude and 5.22 degrees north latitude. (2) In the Little Belt Strait, between 9.47 degrees east longitude and 9.51 degrees east longitude, but navigation is not completely blocked. (Haitong, 14th)

London, official sources here last night said that the British naval patrol day and night on the Norwegian coast has made it "almost impossible for Germany to land in northern Norway. As part of the Allies' plan to cut off communication between Germany and its occupying forces in Norway, Britain is now adopting a deadly new secret mine. Britain has deployed a small fleet in the Kattegat. Any attempt by Germany to transport armaments and supplies and reinforcements through the British minefield will be deterred. It is claimed that the Allied minefields along the coasts of the Netherlands and Norway and between Skagerrak and Kattegat (i.e., the entrance to the Baltic Sea) total about 60,000 square miles. (United Press, 14th)

Paris, after the Allied forces successfully laid mines on the entire North Sea coastline between Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, cutting off Germany's sea transport with its troops in Scandinavia, the center of political, naval, and air warfare has shifted to Skagerrak and Kattegat. Sweden's neutrality is extremely important, because Sweden has a direct railway line from Malmö and Gothenburg to Oslo. If Germany occupies this railway line, it can strengthen its troops in southern Norway and avoid being trapped. French sources said yesterday that they are very uneasy about Sweden's position, because it is the last country bordering the Baltic Sea that has not participated in the war, and its current position is the same as that of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Denmark, and Norway when the Soviet Union and Germany made demands. The Allied cut-off of Germany's sea transport lines is a major threat to Germany. The French Naval Ministry has dispatched 20 French ships, which are now working with the Allied navies to concentrate. French sources announced last night that the key routes in Skagerrak are controlled by the Allied fleet, and the Allied power to keep the strait open can prevent Sweden from being strangled, because Sweden's oil and coal supplies all come from Gothenburg to imports. Sweden has recently reiterated its firm position, refusing any sacrifice of integrity and independence, and has followed the Allies in quickly laying 74 miles of mines in the Kattegat harbor to avoid a repeat of the German naval invasion of Norway and Denmark, and the possible attempt to seize Sweden's important highways.

### Western Front German Army: Offensive Unsuccessful; French Issue Battle Report

Paris, Last night, this station received a dispatch on the Western Front battle report, stating that yesterday's encounter battle resumed with great activity. East of the Moselle River, the German army first launched a heavy artillery attack, then used the artillery fire as cover to launch a localized attack, but it completely failed. The enemy army failed to breach the obstacle line and retreated backward. There were also encounters between reconnaissance teams on both sides in the east, with the victory belonging to the French. Between the Seille River and the Vosges Mountains, the French army launched a surprise attack, which was successful. (Fourteenth day, Reuters dispatch)

Paris, The German army attempted to attack the lower Rhine region yesterday, which was the first time since the outbreak of the European war. A German unit attempted to rapidly cross the river at 2:15 AM yesterday and was ordered to seize an underground battery on an island between Hanneguis and Gambsheim. This place is the entrance to the Rhine River, flowing north and merging with the Roenne Canal, and is a key point for defense. The German attack has been repelled. The French counter-offensive air force has been extremely active in the past two days, reconnoitering the movements of the German front line, but due to the bad weather, the German planes only made a few front-line reconnaissance flights. (Fourteenth day, United Press dispatch)

Berlin, A Hutung News Agency reporter obtained information about the war from responsible parties, which was not published in the German army's battle report. A summary is as follows: The German army has repeatedly used surprise attacks on the Western Front, achieving meritorious service. In Seringues, southwest of Metz, there were two German commando teams that attacked the enemy's positions. Fierce battles broke out between the two sides, even hand-to-hand combat. As a result, the French soldiers were annihilated. German artillery participated in the battle, and the German side suffered very few casualties. Southwest of Sarrelautern, a German commando unit launched a surprise attack, killing ten French soldiers and wounding several others. Only one German soldier was injured. South of Zweibrücken, a French commando unit attempted to attack German positions after an hour of artillery bombardment, suffering heavy losses and returning without success.

### US Industrial Production Declines

Washington, American industrial production has recently experienced an abnormal state of decline. This state may continue, and the period of wartime prosperity seems to have passed. According to statistics published by the Federal Reserve Bank Administration, the American industrial production index fell to 128 in January of last year, and then to 119 in January of this year. In February, it fell again to 109. The main reason is due to the reduction in the production of steel and several other commodities. As for the fact that exports in January were still able to maintain a high level, this was due to changes in foreign conditions and the particularly large amount of American cotton exports.

### Tianjin Concession Blockaded; No Possibility of Termination; Japanese Army Mistreats British; Blockade Seems to Have Three Purposes

North China Daily News, Tianjin, April 8th: Tianjin British people have been suffering for nearly a year. During this period, commerce stagnated, and they still suffer great humiliation. The British people, seeing that their suffering has no end in sight and not receiving the protection of their national representatives, are understandably feeling disappointed. Last summer, when the blockade began, British Foreign Secretary Halifax telegraphed the British people here to remain calm and assured them that the British government would provide all necessary protection. However, a year has passed, and the situation is as bad as ever. There has been no action to end the completely arbitrary and illegal behavior of the Japanese warlords in Tianjin. Many British people frankly say that even if they are mistreated, they have given up the idea of the British authorities lodging protests, because they are of no use. In fact, although the British ambassador to Japan uses flattering words, the British-Japanese relations in Tianjin have not only not improved, but are also deteriorating. In recent weekends, the humiliation suffered by British people entering and leaving the concession has been more arbitrary and shameful than before. This is the truth. British people are deliberately made things difficult for, and often have to wait for three hours before being allowed to pass through the entrances and exits. Sometimes, British people are mixed in with the ranks of Chinese coolies and have to proceed one by one to the entrances and exits to be pushed back into the ranks and then proceed again. Recently, two British people wanted to return to their residences in the concession one evening, but the Japanese soldiers refused them on the grounds that the time was too late and the entrances and exits were closed. The two British people had to spend the night outside the concession. British people who reside in the concession and have to go outside to work also frankly say that the time they spend being blocked at the entrances and exits is more than their working hours. Food transported into the concession, especially that purchased by British people, is bound to encounter all sorts of difficulties. Recently, a truck was forced to dump its contents before being allowed to drive into the concession empty. Such shameful incidents are countless and endless. The most frustrating thing is that this limited treatment is only applied to people holding British passports. People from other countries, including those from the Irish Free State and some dominions, are allowed to pass through the entrances and exits without hindrance. Therefore, holding a British passport is simply inviting humiliation. As for German and Italian people, they receive preferential treatment at the entrances and exits and on the railways. Most of the officers of the Japanese army must have very strong pro- feelings, but this has little to do with how they treat the British people in Tianjin, because the British people had already been mistreated before the outbreak of the European war. The Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin maintain the blockade of the Tianjin concession with their special local and political viewpoints, but they do not care about general policies. The purpose of the blockade seems to be threefold: (1) To give their "allies" the impression that the Japanese army is capable of insulting the nationals of Western powers without interference. (2) To make the lives of the British people extremely unbearable, eventually leading to the return of the concession. (3) To illegally collect donations at the entrances and exits, generating a substantial income. Since the British government will never recognize the Wang regime or make other concessions on general policies, the Tianjin blockade may not end. The Japanese troops in Tianjin have a tough attitude and constantly tell Chinese and other foreigners that the Japanese army in Tianjin is the decisive factor, and that talks in East Asia and elsewhere will not affect the army's plans. Therefore, they believe that it is futile to say flattering and meaningless words that can slightly move the Japanese warlords. It is quite possible that the more rational officials in the Tokyo government do not agree with the views of the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin and do not support the blockade, but they are unwilling to try to make the army realize its mistakes and invite trouble for themselves unless the British government takes a more resolute stance and shows clear means of retaliation. Whether it is appropriate or possible for the British government to take a more resolute stance at this time is still a question, but the British people in Tianjin feel indignant at the authorities' perfunctory attempts, or because the authorities have no means to remove them.

Wishing the final victory of the War of Resistance

(Chongqing Airmail) Before the opening of the Chongqing Children's Day celebration on April 4th, twelve children were selected to pay respects to Chairman Lin, President Chiang and his wife, Commander-in-Chief Liu, Mayor Wu, and Chairman Hong.

The President encouraged them to be loyal to the country and filial to the nation and to follow the items listed in the Party member code and aspire to be good people. Madame Chiang said that there are now many refugees from the war zones who have been sent from the orphanages to ordinary schools to study, and everyone must not despise them, because they are all poor brothers and sisters who have been forced to leave their homes and leave their parents. At the same time, we Chinese people should not only not despise them, but also love them. When they left, each of the children was given a package of candy and several oranges. At 12:00 PM, they paid respects to Chairman Hong. At 4:00 PM, they paid respects to Chairman Lin. At 5:00 PM, they paid respects to President Kong of the China Children's Welfare Association. They all had speeches to offer when they paid respects to each official. The content of the speech to Chairman Lin was roughly divided into three points: (1) Since Chairman Lin has guided the military and civilians of the country to resist Japan for three years, there is already a sense of victory. It is believed that in the near future, the Japanese will be driven out. (2) The children in the occupied areas have been rescued by the government and not only have clothes to wear and food to eat, but also have books to read. (3) All the children in China are willing to work hard under the leadership of the Chairman to prepare to be the reserve army for the War of Resistance. Chairman Kong, Vice President, and Chairman Hong all encouraged them to study hard, step up their training, and prepare to participate in the long-term War of Resistance, and gave them gifts. When the children left, each of them was overjoyed.

### 10,000-Meter Long-Distance Championship: Wang Zhenglin Wins the Qingguang Cup; Time is 34 Minutes and 12 Seconds; Runner-Up Li Duan is 400 Yards Behind

The "Qingguang Cup" 10,000-meter Chinese-Western Championship, organized by the Qingguang Sports Association, started at 8:00 AM yesterday at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road. More than 80 Chinese and Western athletes participated in the competition. Unfortunately, Ding could not participate. Although the British soldiers Grimms and Tumonk drove to the finish line, they still missed the registration, which weakened the competitiveness a lot. As a result, veteran Wang Zhenglin had a smooth ride. Because there was a lack of competition along the way, he failed to break the association's standard of 30 minutes. The runner-up was Li Duan, about 400 yards behind. After the race, Mr. Yan Keping, the president of the association, presented the awards. The Qingguang Cup was retained by Wang Zhenglin for one session. The long-distance race, which was once very popular, came to an end.

At 8:00 AM, a line of people moved forward on Jing'an Temple Road. After 100 yards, the veteran Wang stood out. Hai Lou advanced shoulder to shoulder. Passing Yiding Road, the veteran was like a horse off the leash, rushing forward. Hai Lou knew it was difficult and retreated, and Wan Jinsheng replaced him. Du'an and Pei Gong flew side by side. Liu Guangfa's illness had not recovered, and he was behind the others. Arriving at Kaixuan Road and Yuqing Road, half of the entire journey had passed. The veteran had a smooth ride. Reaching Daxi Road, Wang Zhenglin ran more and more bravely. Near the finish line of Weihaiwei Er'ming Road, the veteran stepped up his powerful sprint, leading the first person by more than 400 yards, and won the Qingguang Cup championship of this session.

### Both Concessions Curb Rising Prices - Essential Goods Must Be Marked with Prices - The Aim Is to Encourage Shop Owners to Suppress Prices - Monopolization and Manipulation Will Be Prosecuted

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Bulletin No. 5233, stating, "The full text of the bulletin and the list of essential goods are attached separately." The purpose of requiring price tags and price lists for various essential goods is to make it easier for citizens to identify and purchase the cheapest items. On the one hand, it encourages shops to do their best to keep prices down in order to attract customers. In addition, the authorities in both concessions plan to publish a price comparison table for various districts in the city every week to facilitate citizen purchases. All of these measures are taken by the authorities to improve people's livelihoods. These measures are only a part of improving people's livelihoods. The real solution still lies in the abolition of various restrictions and taxes in the interior and the smooth transport of supplies from the production areas to Shanghai.

Greatest Cause of Rising Prices

Most citizens attribute the current high prices to merchants' direct or indirect hoarding, manipulation, and speculation. But, in all fairness, the real cause is not something that merchants or municipal authorities can control. For example, all kinds of goods come from the interior, which is not only suffering from war but also under military occupation. The experts hired by the Council to study and prevent merchants' hoarding and other such matters seem to have done their best at present.

Essential Goods - Difficult to Set Price Limits

Furthermore, most of the essential goods listed in the attached table are easily perishable. The so-called market price can only be applied to the direct resale of these goods from producers to consumers. The price of various goods, such as vegetables, fluctuates daily according to the principle of supply and demand. It is impossible to set a price on a daily basis unless the quantity supplied each day can be determined before the market opens. Furthermore, setting a price one week in advance would lead to many abuses. As for setting different prices for the same item, it would easily lead to confusion.

Close Cooperation with the French Concession

On February 29th, the Bureau organized a Price Control Committee to study the measures adopted by the French Concession authorities to control prices in the Public Concession. In March, the Committee suggested to the Bureau that the price control measures to be adopted by the Bureau should be as similar as possible to those adopted by the French Concession authorities. Subsequently, on March 13th, the Bureau issued a bulletin prohibiting the hoarding, manipulation, and speculation of rice and various necessities. Those who do not comply will be prosecuted according to law once discovered. The food problem has been carefully studied and closely cooperated with the French Concession authorities. It is hoped that the various measures currently promulgated by the Bureau will be effective in improving the grain market in this city.

Price Tags - Will Be Reviewed

Before merchants have sufficient time to affix price tags and display price lists, citizens are asked not to report hoarding, speculation, and manipulation to the Bureau's police or health departments. Such reports will be reviewed by the Committee in the future.

Text of the Bulletin

Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council Bulletin No. 5233 states that for the purpose of issuing a bulletin, all persons engaged in the sale of food and other necessities listed in the attached table or any other table published by the Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the "List of Essential Goods") who do not comply with the following rules will be prosecuted by the Bureau according to law: (1) When selling items listed in the List of Essential Goods, a list of prices must be displayed in Chinese, English, or Japanese, as designated by the Bureau, on the stall, in the shop window, or on the outside of the business premises, so that it is clearly visible from the outside; (2) All goods listed in the List of Essential Goods for sale must be labeled with a tag, using numerals at least 1.2 inches in size, indicating the price per pound, per dozen, or per item, etc.; (3) If ordered by the Bureau, a ledger must be kept to accurately record all items in stock, purchased, and sold; (4) For the purpose of checking whether the provisions of this bulletin are complied with, officials of the Bureau may freely enter the business premises.

April 12, 1940, Consul General Baudic.

The list of essential goods stipulated by the French Concession is roughly the same as that of the Public Concession, so it is omitted here.

### French Concession Levies Ordinary Professional License Tax - Nature Seems Redundant - Lawyers and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Express Dissent - Taxpayers' Association Has Negotiated with the French Authorities

The French Concession Public Works Bureau has begun collecting ordinary professional license tax from this year. Lawyers and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are all subject to the tax. Considering its nature, it is similar to the business license tax and seems redundant. The Shanghai Lawyers' Association, the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners' Association, and other organizations have successively sent letters to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting them to reason with the French Concession authorities and strive to revoke the order. The Taxpayers' Association has asked the Chinese directors of the French Concession to negotiate separately and has also sent a letter to the French Concession Public Works Bureau, stating:

Lawyers and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Have Obligations

Respected Sirs, According to a letter from the Shanghai Lawyers' Association, District Committee Branch, it is stated that members of the Association have reported that the French Concession Public Works Bureau has begun collecting ordinary professional license tax from this year, and lawyers are also subject to the tax. This kind of harsh levy greatly harms the interests of all members. Please negotiate reasonably to achieve the goal of revocation, etc. Based on this, lawyers perform their duties to protect human rights. In the event of major criminal cases, the court generally needs to appoint lawyers to provide mandatory defense. This is significantly different from general professions that are purely for profit. We hereby request your Association to quickly make reasonable arguments, etc. Also, according to a letter from the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners' Association, it is stated that members of the Association have reported that members have already obtained a special professional license from the French Concession for practicing medicine in the French Concession and have paid annual donations. Now they have received a notice from the Finance Department of the Public Works Bureau to collect ordinary professional license tax, which is inevitably redundant and unbearable. Please negotiate, etc. Upon arrival, we found that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are by no means comparable to ordinary industrial and commercial businesses. They often provide free medical care and medicine, which is obviously inconsistent with Article 1 of the ordinary professional license regulations. According to the provisions of Articles 2 and 4, they should be exempt from the license. We sincerely request your Association to ask the French Concession authorities not to collect ordinary professional license tax from traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to avoid redundancy, etc. Approved.

Please Exempt from Double Taxation - So as to Comply with Regulations

We believe that lawyers perform their duties, all to protect human rights and safeguard legal benefits, which is one of the three major duties of the judiciary. Also, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners perform their business, and their nature is similar to that of lawyers. They are all committed to protecting human health. These are not comparable to those who are purely for profit. Therefore, it is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 1 of your Bureau's ordinary professional license regulations, which states that individuals or organizations are for their own account and for profit. Furthermore, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who practice medicine in the French Concession, in addition to obtaining a registration license from your Bureau's Health Department, also obtain a business license from the Donation Department and pay business license tax. If an ordinary professional license tax is levied again, it will conflict with the provisions of Article 4 of the ordinary professional license regulations, resulting in redundancy. We hereby inform you of the situation and sincerely request that lawyers, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and other professionals of the same nature be included in the list of those exempt from ordinary professional licenses, so as to comply with regulations and lighten the burden. We hope you will investigate and reply.

### US Flagship Augusta to Sail to Shanghai Next Week - Admiral Hart Expected to Arrive in Shanghai

According to official sources, the US Asiatic Fleet's 10,000-ton flagship Augusta will sail to Shanghai next week. The Augusta left Shanghai last November and sailed south. Also, Admiral Hart's wife and her three daughters arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday aboard the President Cleveland. Hart is currently in Manila and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-May. In addition, the US transport ship Henderson will arrive here on May 1 with 300 US Navy personnel to rotate with the US troops stationed in this city, so that they can return to the US to participate in summer training. It is estimated that about 270 Navy personnel will leave Shanghai on the ship and return to the US at that time. In addition, the US transport ship Chaumont will visit Shanghai three times a year. This is one of the new plans of the US Asiatic Fleet.

### Public Buses Increase Fares - Effective Today - Five Cents for One Stop - Eight Cents for Two Stops

Due to the sharp depreciation of foreign exchange and soaring gasoline prices, the original fares of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company of the Public Concession were difficult to maintain. Therefore, with the approval of the Municipal Council, an increase in fares will be implemented from today. The new fare calculation standard is approximately 6.5 cents per mile, with the following regulations: five cents for one stop, eight cents for two stops, twelve cents for three stops, fifteen cents for four stops, eighteen cents for five stops, twenty-three cents for six stops, twenty-five cents for seven stops, twenty-eight cents for eight stops, and thirty-three cents for nine stops. If it exceeds one stop but is less than two stops, it will also be calculated as two stops. According to the new fares, the first route, which is seven stops, costs 25 cents for the entire journey; the second route, which is nine stops, costs 33 cents for the entire journey; the fifth route, which is two stops, costs eight cents for the entire journey; the seventh route, which is five stops, costs 18 cents for the entire journey; the ninth route, which is eight stops, costs 28 cents for the entire journey; the tenth route, which is five stops, costs 18 cents for the entire journey; the twelfth route, which is eight stops, costs 28 cents for the entire journey; the fourteenth route, which is six stops, costs 23 cents for the entire journey; the fifteenth route, which is four stops, costs 15 cents for the entire journey; the seventeenth route, which is three stops, costs 12 cents for the entire journey. It is heard that the French-owned Water and Electricity Company's electric trams and public buses have also applied to the Public Works Bureau for an increase in fares to maintain operations because the British-owned trams and public buses have already increased prices.

### China Buddhist Association - Moves Office to Chongqing

The China Buddhist Association, located at Juewen Cloister, 418 Hart Road, was formerly presided over by Master Yuanying. According to news from Chongqing, the Association first moved from Shanghai to Ningbo and has now moved from Ningbo to Chongqing. The Association's affairs are all presided over by National Master Zhangjia, Master Shengwen, Layman Qu Xie, and others. They plan to actively reorganize the provincial branches based on the new regulations. Therefore, the China Buddhist Association in this city lacks a presiding officer and has virtually ceased to exist.

### Annual Review of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps - Ceremony Held at 3 PM Yesterday - Chinese Company and Translation Company to Serve as Flag Guard

The annual review ceremony of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession was held at 3 PM yesterday. The outgoing Chairman of the Board, Mr. Fessenden, served as the reviewing commander. Colonel Baker of the US Fourth Marine Regiment, Commander Simons of the British Army, Commander Gasville of the French Army, and the Japanese Army Commander accompanied the review. Colonel Hong Pei, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, served as the commander. The reviewing platform was set up in the open space in front of the Shanghai Club at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Xujiahui Road. Diplomats and military generals from various countries stationed in Shanghai, Western and Chinese directors of the Municipal Council, and others were invited to attend the ceremony. Details are as follows:

Participating Teams

Shanghai Volunteer Corps Headquarters, Shanghai Mounted Troop, US Mounted Troop, Military Band, Headquarters of A Company, A Troop, B Troop, Scottish Troop, Jewish Troop, Anti-Aircraft Artillery Troop, Headquarters of B Company, US Troop, Portuguese Troop, Philippine Troop, US Machine Gun Troop, and the Flag Guard jointly organized by the Chinese Company and Translation Company, Headquarters of C Company, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Troops. Except for the 3rd Troop, which is composed of White Russian volunteers, the rest are paid White Russians, Signal Troop, Armored Car Troop, C Company Machine Gun Troop, Translation Troop, Transport Engineering Troop, Armored Car Troop, Light Artillery Troop, Transport Troop, and six units of armed vehicle patrols. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, all of the above-mentioned troops assembled separately at the Racecourse Baseball Field. At 2:45 PM, they started from the Longfei Gate exit on Ma Huo Road, passed through Nanjing Road and Chengdu Road, and were reviewed by the reviewing commander, Mr. Fessenden, and others on the reviewing platform. The troops were well-organized and marched in unison. The review was completed after half an hour.

Forming the Flag Guard

The Flag Guard was previously appointed from among the members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. This year, it was jointly organized by the Chinese Company and the Translation Company, which is the first time in the history of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps that it has been staffed by Chinese members. It was jointly organized by 52 members of the Chinese Company and the Translation Company and led by Major Chen Shixia, commander of the Chinese and Translation Companies, with Lieutenants Zhou Qingen and Xu Shaomei as his deputies. As for the Chinese Company, it was led by Lieutenant Yu Xianen, deputy commander of the company, with Lieutenants Li Li and Zhang Tinggui as his deputies.

### 1,000 Wounded Japanese Soldiers Transported Back to Japan

Japanese Red Cross Ship No. 160 left Shanghai for Japan early this morning. It is heard that the ship was carrying about 1,000 Japanese wounded soldiers from the front line to be treated in Japan.

### Annual Review of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps: A Quick Sketch Beside the Reviewing Stand

Yesterday, fifty-seven years ago—April 14, 1883—marked the first annual review in the history of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps. At that time, the entire force, combining "officers" and "soldiers," totaled only one hundred and seventy-six men. Yesterday, at 3 PM, in front of the Shanghai Club at the Xujiahui Road (now Hengshan Road) and Nandan Road intersection, the number of personnel who marched past the reviewing stand, including cavalry, infantry, and transport units, was about a hundred times greater. It can be seen that the progress of the SVC is directly proportional to the prosperity and progress of Shanghai over the years.

The review ground was set up in front of the Shanghai Club at the Xujiahui Road (now Hengshan Road) and Nandan Road intersection—near the East Xujiahui Road and Huangjiasha tram station. Starting at 2 PM, several rows of people stood on both sides of the sidewalk along Xujiahui Road, from the racetrack in the east to the intersection of Xujiahui and Nandan Road in the west. The crowd was dense and lively. The distance between these two streets symbolized the growth, density, and thickness of Shanghai's population, seemingly surpassing Denmark by a generation. —Denmark's population is three million eight hundred thousand.

In the opera excerpt "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao," isn't there a line, "Seeing an old man sitting by the roadside"? Yesterday, in front of the Shanghai Club at the Xujiahui Road and Nandan Road intersection, and along the roads on both sides of the Wuyu Lane, many seats were arranged, with men, women, old, and young, both Chinese and foreigners, all sitting "by the roadside." Trolley cars on the second route and buses on routes one, fourteen, and fifteen continued to travel among the seated people before traffic was completely cut off. Especially, the buses often stopped very close to the roadside, and some of the small children sitting in the front row, because of their short stature, seemed shorter than the thick, large tires. One child, sitting directly in front of a wheel and dressed in bright clothes, became an excellent pictorial composition. A Westerner sitting on a double-decker bus, taking advantage of a brief stop, was loudly conversing with a plump lady sitting "by the roadside." In short, the people on the bus had a strange feeling looking at the people sitting on the sidewalks, and the audience sitting on the stand inevitably became the target of their gazes.

The reviewing stand was set up in the middle of the road, with grandstands behind and to the sides. The one marked with the letter J was the grandstand for the diplomatic corps and the members of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Like the reviewing stand, its base was surrounded by red and blue silk cloth to show solemnity. At precisely 3 PM, Mr. Fessenden, the outgoing Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, walked onto the reviewing stand, and the Shanghai Municipal Council flag, with a red emblem on a white background, was immediately hoisted on the nearby flagpole. Just as his body was standing upright, and the flag had just been raised to the top of the mast, fluttering in the wind, it was very pleasing to the eye, and coordinated very well with Mr. Fessenden's high hat and dark suit. At this time, looking east towards the racetrack, one could faintly see three white horses approaching. Western policemen riding horses and Indian policemen wearing red turbans continuously patrolled, acting as forerunners. Chinese and Western volunteers serving as sentries were also particularly busy, trying their best to restrain the spectators on the sidewalk within the roped-off area.

After Mr. Fessenden took the stand, the commanders of the British, American, French, and Japanese garrisons stationed in Shanghai, a total of six people, followed onto the field. They were relaxed and smiling. In a group interwoven with red hats, white hats, black uniforms, and yellow military uniforms of various colors, everyone shook hands and exchanged greetings. For a time, this reviewing stand, only a few feet square, was filled with an atmosphere of international harmony. Chairman Fessenden, with his dignified demeanor, led the group, standing in front, his spotless white collar paired with a dark brown tie, and a purple flower inserted in his left lapel, echoing the corner of a white handkerchief poking out diagonally. Three or four minutes after he took the stand, the three officers of the Volunteer Corps Headquarters riding white horses appeared before them. The commander shouted the order "Left—Dress!" and the cavalrymen who followed each paid attention to Mr. Fessenden, and those holding swords performed the sword salute. Mr. Fessenden removed his top hat, pressed it to his chest with his right hand, and, as the crowd applauded, watched intently as the parade passed by.

The procession began with the cavalry and ended with the transport vehicles. The British Royal Leinster Regiment band stood on the road opposite the reviewing stand, playing music, which invigorated everyone. From the first horse passing the reviewing stand to the last truck, it took about twenty minutes. People in military uniforms and carrying guns were walking in the middle of the road, high-ranking foreign military and political personnel from Shanghai were standing on the reviewing stand, and men, women, old, and young, Chinese and Westerners, were sitting calmly in the grandstands and on the sidewalks. Including those who stopped at both ends, waiting for the traffic jam to clear in buses, trams, rickshaws, and those walking on horses, and those watching the excitement on the roofs of residential buildings and shops near the Shanghai Club… In these twenty minutes, apart from the clear spring sky with faint sunlight that could be seen by looking up, everything around, moving and still, showed that the Shanghai International Settlement was a place completely filled with people.

### Foreign Troops Stationed in Shanghai Inspected Today; Farewell to French Military Commander Colonel Gascoigne Who is About to Return Home; French Troops Inspected and Awarded Medals Yesterday Morning

The French Shanghai Daily reported that French Garrison Commander Colonel Gascoigne is about to return home. The commanders of the foreign troops stationed in Shanghai have each dispatched a company of soldiers to assemble at the Racecourse at 10:00 AM today for Colonel Gascoigne to review, to show their respect.

Awarding of Medals

At 9:15 AM yesterday morning, the various units of the French troops stationed in Shanghai gathered at the Gujiazhai Park training ground for a review, as noted in yesterday's newspaper. At that time, a company of marines from the "Garnier" warship, three companies of colonial infantry, and two auxiliary squads of Russian detectives from the French Concession Police participated, standing on three sides, with the fourth side being the seats for naval and military officers. Colonel Gascoigne arrived, and the military band played music to salute him. Captain Fleurquin and Lieutenant Bouet accompanied him to inspect the troops. Then, the officers went to the middle of the training ground to participate in the ceremony where Colonel Gascoigne awarded Captain Fleurquin a medal. After the ceremony, they paraded in formation, with tanks participating.

Tea Party Held

At 11:30 AM the day before yesterday (the 13th), Colonel and Mrs. Gascoigne also held a tea party at the French Club, inviting members of the diplomatic community in Shanghai. Commanders of the armed forces stationed in various countries, military attachés, consulate personnel, and officials from the British and French Concessions attended, with hundreds of guests, making it a grand occasion.

During the last World War, he repeatedly performed great feats and was twice commended by military orders. In 1924, he entered the Higher Military School to study warfare. In 1928, he was sent to Myanmar as a military attaché. From November 1936 to November 1938, he served as the commander of the 19th Mixed Brigade of Colonial Infantry in Annam, overseeing the forces of the First Military Region. In March 1937, while serving in Annam, Colonel Gascoigne was promoted to colonel at the age of forty-five. At the end of 1938, Colonel Gascoigne went to Tianjin to serve as a senior military official stationed there.

### Tan Shaoliang's Coffin Sealed Yesterday; Chinese Detective Killed by Gunfire Yesterday Morning

At 9:05 AM the day before yesterday, when Tan Shaoliang, a Cantonese man and the director of the Second Section of the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police, was assassinated on Weihaiwei Road (today Weihai Road), a Chinese detective, No. 2556, was also shot in the abdomen. He was seriously injured and sent to the Shanhaiguan Road Police Hospital for treatment, but his injuries were too severe, and he died at 6:45 AM yesterday morning. It is also learned that the body of Tan Shaoliang, who was assassinated, was placed in a coffin at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. The Shanghai Municipal Police lowered its flag to half-mast to mourn him.

### The Nanshi Branch of the "Central Market" Still Difficult to Open; The Iron Gates of the 16 Pootung Pier Have Not Yet Been Opened

For more than half a year, the Japanese and puppet regimes have been plotting to control all local goods in Shanghai and planned to establish puppet "Central Markets" on Route Tenant de Possesse (today Middle Huaihai Road) and a Nanshi branch. Currently, the first two locations have gradually opened. The Nanshi location was originally scheduled to open today, but because the French Concession authorities have not yet opened the iron gates of the 16 Pootung Pier, it has become another pipe dream. The details are as follows:

Opening Today Still Difficult to Realize

The Nanshi branch of the "Central Market" is located near the Ning Shao Pier in Nanshi. Since the establishment of the "Central Market" and the Route Tenant de Possesse branch, the Japanese and puppet regimes have been actively preparing for the opening of the Nanshi branch. On one hand, they have been trying their best to request the French Concession authorities to open the iron gates of the 16 Pootung Pier to facilitate the transportation of local goods. On the other hand, they have been speeding up the arrangement of the "market." Several vegetable markets have already been set up inside the branch, but the decoration has not yet been completed and is being expedited. The branch was originally scheduled to officially open today, and there was a rumor that the iron gates of the 16 Pootung Pier would also open today, but according to reliable sources, the iron gates of the 16 Pootung Pier will not open today, so it is still difficult for the Nanshi branch to open.

Local Goods Merchants Refuse to Participate

However, the Japanese and puppet regimes are still preparing to open the Nanshi branch in the short term, so they are now using unemployed people in the local goods industry to entice and coerce merchants from the 16 Pootung Pier and other places to participate. It is reported that the Japanese and puppet regimes have sent people to entice and coerce local goods merchants at the 16 Pootung Pier to register and have stipulated that the "deposit" for the pier is 100,000 yuan. Depending on the size of the local goods business, each company is assigned 3,000 to 5,000 yuan as a guarantee for participation. The method is the same as the "Central Market." According to sources from local goods merchants yesterday, although the Nanshi branch will open in the short term, only a few small-scale local goods merchants have registered so far, and the number is very small. Most of the larger-scale local goods merchants have refused to register. Taking the "Central Market" as an example, they will not rashly join in order to avoid trouble.

### Tram and Bus Scrip to Be Recalled; Official Announcement Soon

Aluminum one-cent and five-cent coins have been circulating in the Shanghai Special Administrative Region. The bus and tram companies issued fare scrip to temporarily remedy the shortage of small change. Now that small change is abundant and circulating in Shanghai, in order to respect China's monetary system, it has been decided to stop issuing scrip and to recall all scrip that has already been issued in a short period of time. It is heard that the authorities of the companies concerned will issue an official announcement soon.

### Free Epidemic Prevention Injections; Campaign to Be Held from the 15th

The Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department has scheduled a free epidemic prevention injection campaign for residents starting on the 15th of this month. There will be four injection sites in the Western District, two in the Central District, and one each in the Northeastern districts, as listed below:

Residents who wish to receive epidemic prevention injections can apply for free injections at the above-mentioned branches. However, Saturdays afternoons, Sundays, and public holidays are excluded. Residents who wish to obtain epidemic prevention injection certificates for local use can apply to the above-mentioned branches. Those who wish to apply for such certificates because they are leaving Shanghai are only allowed to apply to the Health Branch at 340 Hankou Road (today Hankou Road). Factories that want to have their workers vaccinated should request in writing that the Health Branch dispatch a mobile epidemic prevention team to provide injections between the 15th of this month and the 15th of next month, but only for factories with 100 or 120 or more workers who will be vaccinated at the same time. In addition, groups that wish to obtain epidemic prevention injections and have their own doctors provide the injections may apply to the Health Department in writing for approval.

### Public Discussion in the Knitting Industry on Sales Methods among Members

The Knitting Industry Association, in view of the recent erratic fluctuations in the price of raw materials, and if remedial measures are not taken quickly, all knitting factories will be seriously threatened. In order to adjust the legitimate business of both parties and prevent manipulation and speculation, the industry has jointly agreed on the following business methods: (1) For customers who have requested additional goods from members of the association before today, whether orally or in writing, but have not entered into a formal contract, all the goods must be paid for in cash by the 20th of this month to sign a formal contract. Otherwise, this one-sided additional order will not be considered a firm order and will be invalid. (2) Those who have paid a portion of the goods but have not entered into a formal contract should also make up the remaining payment within the aforementioned deadline. Otherwise, the goods will be shipped according to the amount paid. (3) Formal contracts that have been signed by both parties will be handled according to the terms listed in the contract. In the future, additional goods must be formally contracted and a deposit of more than 50% of the total amount must be paid in advance to be valid.

### Summary of Important News

It is learned that the Coal Industry Association has already forwarded letters to the three coal companies, Ewo Yuen, Wah Chong, and Yuan Tai. The three companies have expressed agreement and will act accordingly, supplying the public bathhouses with coal at fair prices. The Coal Industry Association has decided to sell the fourth batch of coal at fair prices. It is heard that the price will still be 50 yuan per ton, and each household will be limited to one ton while supplies last.

### Married Woman Sues Paternal Uncle and Others for Encroachment; Lawsuit Dismissed for Being Time-Barred

After the death of Xie Zinan, a wealthy merchant from Huzhou, he left behind three sons, named Weiqing, Siting, and Zhisun. Siting and Zhisun also passed away successively. The large amount of inheritance left behind was not divided, but was jointly managed by Xie Weiqing and Siting's son Shengzu (father named Zhaoji) and Zhisun's son Bingru. Then, Xie Yunzhen, Siting's daughter (married to Li Yunsun), filed a lawsuit in 1937 against the administrators to demand payment of the inheritance.

After a definitive judgment was issued, it was determined that Xie Yunzhen should be given one-twentieth of all of Xie Zinan's estate after deducting the debts. Since the judgment, the administrators have first cleared the debts. Unexpectedly, Xie Yunzhen suddenly hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the criminal division of a court against her paternal uncle Xie Weiqing, her elder brother Xie Shengzu, and her cousin Xie Bingru for encroachment and damage.

Claiming Encroachment of Creditor's Rights

Stating that Xie had disposed of 460 shares of Hong Kong Union Insurance Company stock worth over 75,000 yuan without authorization, and had also hidden the rental receipts for the buildings in Daoda Lane managed by Daoda Company, etc. Xie Weiqing and others also hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to defend, stating that the sale of the Hong Kong Union Insurance Company's stock was actually due to the poor financial turnover of the Tenth China First Knitting Factory property in the joint property.

Lack of Funding

And had no choice but to do so, but the eight shares that Xie Yunzhen should inherit were still reserved, and what was sold belonged to the defendants' own inherited shares. As for the Daoda Lane management part, because the bookkeeper Zou Zhaowen disappeared during the August 13th Incident, most of the rental receipt stubs managed by him were not handed over and could not be found after searching everywhere. It was reported to the execution office, and these items are specific items and cannot be replaced by other items, so the plaintiff's claim is simply

Cannot Be Established

Furthermore, it was found that the case was a prosecution-dependent case, with a statute of limitations of six months. Now that the statutory time limit has been exceeded, they have no right to sue according to law and should be asked to dismiss the complaint. After the court summoned them yesterday, the result was that the court recognized that the plaintiff's claim was time-barred and ruled that the case would not be accepted.

### Du Baoru Transferred to the Special Division of the High Court

### Kidnappers Arrested; Several Young Girls Rescued

Huishi Police Station Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Detective Liu Shuxun, and Detective Yang Xichen received a secret tip from an informant at about 3:00 AM yesterday morning that a large number of kidnappers were hiding at No. 62, Lane 510, Rue Amiral Courbet (today Middle Huaihai Road), so they coordinated with Western detectives to rush to the address. They arrested five people from Suzhou: Yu Yuanliang, Jiang Changgen, Shen Nanshan, and women Yu Hua and Shen Yu. They rescued Suzhou girls Zou Ami (16 years old), Hua Aying (16 years old), Wang Baobao (17 years old), Shandong girl Shen Yunbao (16 years old), Yu Juzhen (16 years old), and Yu Awu (13 years old). They were all taken to the police station and sent to the Third Criminal Division of the court yesterday. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and requested a period for investigation. Then, Chinese and Western detectives explained the case details. After Judge Jiang Shuzi interrogated Yu Yuanliang and the other five defendants, their confessions were evasive, and they were remanded in custody for another hearing.

### Young Couple Sues Each Other; One Wants Separation, One Wants Cohabitation

Gao Jinquan, a local young man residing at No. 24, Lane 730, Avenue Dubail (today Middle Huaihai Road) in the French Concession, (22 years old, currently studying at Guanghua Middle School,) recently hired lawyer Wang Henggu to file a lawsuit in the civil division of the Second Special Court against his abandoned wife, Zhu Zhengyan (18 years old this year, from Zhoupu, Pudong, currently residing at No. 28, Hepingfang, Kaifeng Road), requesting cohabitation. It is claimed that the plaintiff married the defendant through matchmakers Yan Guanfu and Wang Wenda in March of last year. Unexpectedly, after the defendant entered the house, she was restless and made excuses to return to Ningbo, taking away her clothes, leaving the suitcases empty. In November, she left again and has not returned since. Despite repeated urgings, there has been no effect. Therefore, he requested the court to order the defendant to return home immediately to cohabit. According to the lawsuit, Judge Yu from the Civil Seventh Division summoned them yesterday. The plaintiff testified as above. The defendant hired lawyer Wang Jian'e to appear in court and submitted a defense, stating that the plaintiff disliked the defendant's poverty and became disgusted. First, there was cold sarcasm and ridicule, and then all kinds of abuse, often causing pain. On July 1 last year, the defendant attempted to commit suicide by taking Lysol and drowning herself after being beaten by the plaintiff. Fortunately, her family discovered it and sent her to the hospital for treatment. There is a case to refer to. Moreover, the defendant has also filed a separate suit in your court, so he requested that the cases be consolidated. The court adjourned the matter and instructed that it be rescheduled after verification.

### Ticket Seller Killed in Accident

At 8:30 PM last night, an eighteen route trolleybus (car number 163) running on Henan Road and Laobaidu Road (today Renmin Road and East Yan'an Road) had its conductor, Wu Chengsheng, from Jiangbei, 30 years old, number 133, chatting with a passenger on the trolleybus behind buying a ticket, and his head was sticking out of the window. The car was going very fast, causing his head to hit a utility pole on the side of the road, causing his brain to rupture and blood to gush out like a spring. An ambulance was urgently called to fly the injured to the Jishi Hospital, but he died before treatment could be administered.

### Social News

Chen Jinbao, a local man, 28 years old, with no occupation, went to the Nanjing Hotel at No. 36, Hongyunfang, Avenue Edward VII (today East Nanjing Road) in the French Concession with a woman surnamed Wang (26 years old) at 9 PM the other night. The two claimed to be husband and wife and rented the room for the night. After one night, the woman went out the next morning and did not return. Chen slept alone in the room. At 7 PM in the evening, he had not yet gotten up, and the room attendant entered the room to check on him, only to find that Chen had committed suicide by drinking poison and had already died. The woman surnamed Wang, who stayed with him overnight, has not visited the hotel to inquire, nor has any family member come to claim the body. According to general speculation, this woman is likely a prostitute. The deceased had long intended to commit suicide, called a prostitute to celebrate one last night, and finally committed suicide to end his life.

Zhu Honglai, a six-year-old girl from Shaoxing, living in a bungalow at No. 855 Lane, Chenjia Lane, Xihai Road (today West Nanjing Road), was playing by the pond in front of her house alone at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. She accidentally fell into the water and was immediately discovered and rescued, but she was already unconscious. She was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died shortly after.

### Zhang Shirong Opens Clinic

Dr. Zhang Shirong, a graduate of St. John's University, has opened a clinic inside the Lizhi Pharmacy at No. 811 Nanjing Road (today East Nanjing Road) on the 15th of this month. He will be available for consultation from 1 to 4 PM every day. After 5 PM, he will be available for consultation at No. 80 Jiujiang Road (today Jiujiang Road). It is heard that Dr. Zhang aims to serve the community, so he has set the consultation fees very low, and he is especially willing to provide convenience to the sick and poor.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, saying that the weather in Shandong is clear with a turning and moderate northwest to north wind. It is cloudy here with a northwest wind or light breeze. There is a north to east wind south of Ma'an Island, with fog falling in several places. Also, in the 14 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 61.5 degrees and the lowest was 44.6 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 58.8 degrees and the lowest was 54.7 degrees.

### Mei Shaoxiong's Embezzlement Case Resolved Through Settlement; Appeal to the Third Instance Remanded for Retrial; Both Parties Settle and Withdraw Lawsuit

Mei Shaoxiong, a Cantonese man and the owner of Mei Sheng Jihao, residing at No. 196, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple Road (today West Nanjing Road), was hired by Zhen Feng Dongji Sugar Company at No. 17 Yong'an Street (today Central Shandong Road) in the spring of 1937 to serve as the head of business in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces for the company. After half a year, Mei handled business introductions of about 800,000 yuan. Later, due to disagreements between the two parties, Mei resigned. He Jing, the manager of Zhen Feng Sugar Company, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the criminal division of the Second Special Court, accusing Mei of embezzlement, stating that Mei had 700,000 yuan in accounts in his hands.

Unsettled Procedures; Mei also hired lawyer Ge Zhiqin to file a lawsuit in the court, countersuing He Jing for false accusation, claiming that He wanted to embezzle his huge commission and fabricated facts. The initial judgment found both parties not guilty. Both parties refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the criminal division of the Third Branch of the High Court at the same time. As a result of the trial, Judge Wu sentenced Mei to a fine of 500 yuan. Mei still did not accept the judgment and appealed again to the Supreme Court. After reviewing the case, Weng Jing, the presiding judge of the Shanghai Special Division of the Supreme Court, believed that the criminal division of the Third Branch of the High Court's sentencing of Mei Shaoxiong to a fine seemed inappropriate, so he sent it back to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for

Further Retrial; The appellant He Jing suddenly entrusted a friend to mediate with Mei, willing to compensate Mei for litigation losses of 1,000 yuan in national currency, and the commission portion should be calculated as before. And both parties withdrew the lawsuit and jointly issued a statement in the newspaper to clarify the misunderstanding. The huge embezzlement case that had been entangled for more than a year has finally come to an end.

### Old Newspaper Excerpts, Sixty-Seven Years Ago (355) (From the Shun Pao, Twelfth Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)

Relief Tickets for Healing

At the beginning of the Henan relief donation campaign, it was originally intended to issue one receipt per household. Later, receipts were drawn by household. By June and July, many households in the Suzhou area had received receipts, even to the extent that a donation of 200 cash was divided into two households. Whenever people came with money, they didn't say they were donating for relief, but that they were "obtaining a ticket," which seemed strange. When asked why, they replied, "For healing." What kind of healing? Burning the relief ticket to ashes and taking it with water. Some said that tickets without a surname were most effective, while others said that general tickets were most effective. This was particularly common in Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Kunshan, Xishui and other counties, and also widely believed in Jiaxing, Zhejiang. Last month, Mrs. Zhang from Kunshan specially hired a boat to Suzhou and donated 140 yuan.

Aiding Relief Through Gambling

Gambling is a trivial matter. We often gather at the Simei Xuan in Yuyuan Garden during our leisure time to enjoy tea, and often play chess. Occasionally, we gamble to decide who pays for the wine. When the mood is high, the friendship is deep. However, considering the recent relief donations, if we simply use the gambling money for daily expenses, we would feel guilty. Therefore, from March 1st, we will donate the gambling winnings. Neither the winnings nor losses will be returned, and the money will not be discounted. Once two yuan is collected, it will be handed over to the office. The receipts will be posted in the Xuan for public viewing, which is truly a refined and profound gesture.

A Peak Flies Away

The thirty-six peaks of Huangshan Mountain have long been known as scenic spots, recorded in historical records. Scholars and poets who visited there came one after another. However, this year, one peak suddenly flew away. It is said that the local officials have already reported this matter to the higher authorities in detail. Changes in hills and valleys have been common since ancient times. This peak probably collapsed due to its age, which is not surprising.

### Self-Management of the Shanghai Market (Part 2) —Summary of the Third Symposium of This Publication—

Date: March 31, 1940, 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM

Attendees: (Signatures in no particular order)

Wang Haibo: After speculative capital withdraws from the commodity speculation stage, prices will naturally tend to stabilize. But that's just stability. To suppress and level them, it is still necessary to solve the source problem. If you want to manage it, then you must know that what Mr. Yang Yao said about those difficulties is indeed the actual situation of the industrial and commercial sectors.

Chairman: Now we only hear about production and sales cooperation, but not about production, sales, and consumer cooperation. I think the work of managing prices must be achieved through cooperation from all three parties. For agricultural products, it is already very difficult to obtain the cooperation of farmers. Now there are more obstacles from the Japanese and puppet regimes, so it is even more difficult. But no matter what, the sales and consumer aspects must still cooperate. This approach is certainly very difficult, but at this time and place, this is the only way to unite against the outside.

Wei Youfei: In theory, production, sales, and consumers are "coexistent and prosperous." But in reality, consumers are always exploited.

Chairman: The consumers I'm talking about are not limited to the final consumer. For example, hardware importers, wholesalers, and retailers act as the sales side, while the construction industry, various processing industries, etc., which have a large demand for hardware, act as the consumer side. They can form a combination, establish price agreements, and even distribution agreements to prevent competitive purchasing or free speculation. It is best for each industry association to participate in the combination as a unit.

Chairman: When this type of combination becomes widespread, competitive purchasing will be reduced. Therefore, the pressure on foreign exchange will be reduced invisibly. At least it can prevent the exchange market from being stimulated and fluctuating due to competitive settlement.

Wang Haibo: This approach is too idealistic. (1) The current social economy is a free system. (2) Without political power as a backing, organizations can never be widespread. (3) The industry association itself is just a signboard. At most, there are only a few secretaries inside who can accomplish anything? (4) The leaders in the industry association are, in fact, the leaders of the industry. They have strong power, so the interests of their actions are particularly large. The established rules may not be followed by everyone. Sometimes even those leaders themselves do not abide by them. (5) The uses of various goods are actually extremely complicated. Therefore, it is impossible to get related parties to form distribution agreements or price agreements.

Wei Youfei: Perhaps the procurement of important goods should be concentrated in the hands of the chamber of commerce or the industry association of each industry. The chamber of commerce or industry association of each industry should be organized into a large-scale procurement agency and wholesale agency. Thus, for incoming prices, considerable control can be exercised. Wholesale prices can of course be regulated. Retail prices will not have much difference.

Pan Hengqin: The industry association price may be higher than the market price. Then wouldn't the industry association incur losses?

Wei Youfei: If the market price is lower than the industry association price, the industry association does not have to supply.

Pan Hengqin: Wouldn't this be suspected of hoarding?

Wei Youfei: In fact, the cost of group procurement is always lower than individual procurement. So the industry association price is not actually more expensive than the market price.

Pan Hengqin: The organization needs a lot of funds. The source should be resolved.

Wei Youfei: Please cooperate with the banking industry association.

Chairman: At this time, the banking industry association should clearly stipulate that each bank and shop must no longer engage in goods collateral transactions with private individuals. All collateral transactions must be made with the organization as the counterparty. Those who violate this agreement should be severely sanctioned. At the same time, each organization can also refer to the joint reserve system of the banking industry and the system of submitting reserves for the use of interbank transfer certificates, etc., and submit reserve funds to the organization as a deposit for purchasing goods from the organization. This can also slightly reduce the financial burden on the business of each merchant. Therefore, they will be happy to participate.

Pan Hengqin: Should private transactions outside the market be prohibited?

Chairman: That's not necessary. If there are off-market transactions, the price should be lower than the industry association price. If the off-market transaction price is more expensive than the industry association price, then the industry association's supply capacity is probably in trouble. That is serious.

Wei Youfei: So we should achieve unlimited supply. However, if the off-market price is lower than the industry association price, it may not be necessary to supply.

Chairman: What I fear is that people will act selfishly and give convenience to companies they are related to in hoarding large quantities, thereby sacrificing the interests of the public. Therefore, if centralized procurement can be achieved, distribution agreements should be further handled. At the same time, a supervisory body should also be organized, with fair-minded people from outside the industry participating.

Wang Haibo: Here I also feel that there are three difficulties: (1) The industry association itself lacks talent. (2) How will the losses or profits incurred during the operation of the industry association be handled? (3) Commercial profits and losses depend entirely on access to information. How will they obtain this information?

Chairman: This organization is, in fact, no different from a cartel. Therefore, the leaders of each industry will certainly not be willing to stay out of it, and the participating member merchants will not be willing to lag behind. As for the results of the operation, there should be no losses. As Brother Youfei said: If the cloth price is lower than the industry association price, the industry association can honestly and politely not supply. Although this has the suspicion of manipulation, as long as his industry association price does not include manipulative profits, that is, illegal profits. However, legitimate profits should also be recognized. It is best to use this type of income as a balancing fund, so that the benefits are still returned to the public. As for information, it should actually be easier to obtain than when operating individually. Moreover, since the industry association price is leading the market price, the relationship of timely information is also relatively less important. However, which industries should we start with? It is worth studying.

Pan Hengqin: Of course, we should start with daily necessities first.

Wang Haibo: But the types of goods are extremely complicated, and the quality of the same goods also varies greatly. Therefore, the establishment of industry association prices is actually still difficult. Therefore, which industries should we start with? It is still worth studying. I think the decision should be based on two principles: (1) It can be purchased in large quantities and meets the needs of the public. Only by purchasing in large quantities can we supply in large quantities, so that the industry association price can gain the right to lead the market price. (2) When setting industry association prices, it is also necessary to implement a standard commodity system, and at the same time, it is best not to use technical selection. So like rice, coal briquettes, flour, oil, salt, etc., we can try to implement them first. That is to say: the grain industry, the distillery industry, the fuel industry, etc., should be tried first.

Supply and Demand Adjustment and Self-Defense Measures

If the balance of supply and demand is not maintained, the effectiveness of price policies cannot be guaranteed. This city is actually considered an industrial area, but the source of raw materials is either the remnants flowing out of the hands of the Japanese and puppet regimes, or it must accept the heavy burden of foreign exchange. Moreover, there is no freedom to obtain it. This is not only true for raw materials, but also for all non-industrial products such as grain!

Pan Hengqin: Hoarding is one of the root causes of disrupting the balance of supply and demand. Eliminating hoarding and speculation will also increase the possibility of balancing supply and demand.

Wang Haibo: I think that if speculative capital is used properly, the relationship between supply and demand of goods can also achieve the principle of balance.

Wei Youfei: This should start with correcting the city's industrial policy. If the city's factories are relocated to the southwest, the raw material problem will not be so serious!

Pan Hengqin: A friend of mine recently published an article in the Ta Kung Pao entitled "A Simple Choice." For the various difficult questions raised by the general public, he only gave a simple answer, that is, "Victory in the War of Resistance, any difficulty can be solved easily."

Chairman: If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to? Enduring all the hardships of wartime is a duty that every citizen should fulfill, just like bearing the costs of war.

Pan Hengqin: Thrift is conducive to balancing prices, and it also affects the balance of supply and demand.

Wang Haibo: Except for those who make war money and new rich, I'm afraid there is nothing to save and nothing to cut back.

Chairman: Savings in the cost of living, which are targeted at the petty bourgeoisie, are still worth advocating. The nouveau riche are not interested.

Wang Haibo: Taking Shanghai as an example, we should break the vanity of saving face. Friends who are strong on the outside but weak on the inside should not show off any more.

Wei Youfei: This can be promoted like a movement to promote integrity and shame.

Chairman: After the May Fourth Movement, there were many thrift societies, moral advancement societies, and other organizations that focused on personal cultivation and rationalizing life in various places. Now they should be revived. In addition to saving living expenses, it is also worth advocating for raw material savings, the research and promotion of substitute products. Raw material savings are closely related to correcting industrial policy. For example, running a silk factory in Shanghai is not only doing business with the "Central China Silk Company," but it is also a dead end. It is better to transform its machinery and equipment and switch to other production.

Wei Youfei: It is best to move to western Zhejiang, eastern Jiangsu, or even Chengdu. Otherwise, raw materials will still be a problem.

Chairman: From the perspective of balancing international payments, enriching people's livelihoods, and strengthening national power, the principle of "Buy Chinese Goods First" should still be firmly maintained. However, domestic products under the control of the enemy have actually changed in nature. Therefore, when the rice crisis occurred at the beginning, this publication advocated for joint purchase of foreign rice. This is not only to smash the other party's monopoly, attack their exploitation from the middle, and reduce their attempts to absorb legal tender to disrupt foreign exchange, but also to open a possible way to improve supply sources. However, what people generally call "opening up supply sources" always means wanting to negotiate with the Japanese and puppet regimes. In fact, this kind of negotiation is what the enemy hopes to hold.

Pan Hengqin: This will increase the burden on the exchange market. If Wang Haibo's speculative capital can find a reasonable outlet and withdraw from the exchange market, this burden will not be a big deal.

Chairman: What I mean is a principle of complementing domestic goods with foreign goods. Importing foreign goods is a means, and obtaining domestic goods is the goal. During the skyrocketing rice prices last winter, residents in the concessions were all determined to eat foreign rice. Moreover, they were indeed ordering foreign rice one after another, and rice produced in the occupied areas was also transported to Shanghai. As for cotton, why wouldn't it be the same? But silk is different because there is no market for fresh cocoons abroad; the only way is to rely on the occupied areas. Therefore, the degree of the skyrocketing silk prices is particularly fierce. Therefore, it is feared that changing industries is the most beneficial way for silk factories under the industrial policies of Shanghai. (Continued below)

### Black Market Prices in Japan

—Yu

The war of aggression against China, which has lasted for more than thirty months, has long exhausted Japan's economy. No matter how its government implements violent control and blocks its news, making it impossible for the suffering of its people to be leaked, the panic has become extremely serious and cannot be concealed. Therefore, its magazines and newspapers have also leaked cries of sorrow from time to time. For example, its commodity market, due to the implementation of price controls and rationing controls, has long seen the emergence of a black market; however, it has been banned from being published. However, the Tokyo Economist magazine, published on February 21 of this year, blatantly contained the black market prices of several kinds of goods. This is not a neglect of those who control the news; I think that what is contained in the magazine is still lighter than the actual situation. Although, if compared with its official prices, there is a world of difference, as shown in the following table (unit: Japanese yen)

### Introduction to Universal New Style Account Forms of Kung Sheung Certified Public Accountants

—Pan Xulun

The application of new accounting systems in industrial and commercial enterprises in our country is generally limited to large-scale manufacturers. Smaller-scale manufacturers mostly follow old habits and use old systems. Manufacturers are not unaware of the advantages of the new accounting system, but they still use the old system. The obstacles are nothing more than two points: the difficulty of finding talent, and the cost of system design and account book printing. The so-called difficulty of finding talent is that manufacturers want to change their system and hire specialists, but if they are not familiar with old-style business practices, there will be many obstacles. As for Chinese-style account books, the price is lower, and account books of the same format can often be used for multiple purposes. A manufacturer that uses 20 account books a year will spend no more than 40 or 50 yuan. If new account books are used, planning the format is not something everyone can do, and once the planning is complete, the printing cost of one or two dozen account books is often more than one or two hundred yuan, which is much more inconvenient than using the old system.

In order to remedy the above two difficulties, people in our accounting profession have made many efforts. The accounting tutorial school I established may be of some convenience to industrial and commercial employees who study accounting in their spare time. In the past four or five years, Mr. Xu Yongzuo has advocated improving Chinese-style bookkeeping. Based on the size of industrial and commercial enterprises and the differences in business types, he has formulated several standard systems. Thus, the work of planning the old-style industrial and commercial accounting system has been greatly reduced. Mr. Xu then printed the various account book formats in the formulated system into several types of account books, so that the account books of industrial and commercial enterprises could be supplied centrally, and the cost of account books in various industries was reduced. However, the system set by Mr. Xu is still an improved Chinese style, not a completely Western style, so the supply is limited to one aspect and has not been popularized in businesses that use Western-style systems.

This year, the Shanghai Kung Sheung Certified Public Accountants designed "Universal New Style Account Forms," which are centrally printed and supplied in large quantities. As a result, businesses that use Western-style account books have also gained great convenience. I read the sample account forms of that office and saw that there are several styles of vouchers (transfer slips), receipts, journals, cash books, and classification books, which are very well designed. Those who use the new accounting system in various industries can learn about the system of accounting from the "Introduction to the Application of Universal New Style Account Forms of Kung Sheung Certified Public Accountants" compiled by the office, thus saving the labor of planning the system. And the account forms used can be purchased at a low price, so there is no need to print them specially, which would result in a large amount of printing costs. With this convenience, what kind of obstacles are there for new-style accounting in the industrial and commercial sectors? As for the easy-to-handle work, what kind of obstacles are there? As a result, I am happy to see the promotion of accounting reform in my country's industrial and commercial sectors.

Commercial News

### Securities: New York Shipyard Shares Rise to a New High

New York, 13th. Today's stock market trend is slightly better. There are no other news in the market. The increased orders and outstanding orders received by the shipyard have caused this stock to reach a new high. The iron center reports a lower working schedule, but this is offset by the price drop.

### Rubber: Market Situation Calm

New York, 13th. The rubber market is calm. Arrivals are decreasing, while prices are rising. There are signs of a lack of cabin space and increased water feet. The market should respond quickly.

### Grain: American Wheat Trading Quiet

Chicago, 13th. News about the wheat market and the new war is scarce. Trading became sluggish as brokerage houses absorbed sales from Chicago and local groups.

### Hardware: The Wind of Hoarding Rises Again

Yesterday, the hardware market was quiet due to the Sunday holiday. According to general opinion, the expansion of the European war will cause hardware prices to rise again, leading to a resurgence of hoarding. Moreover, the industry is unwilling to easily sell goods in large quantities, so the market is unusually sluggish, and the asking price for each good is gradually increasing.

Hygiene for Both Sexes

### Couples of the Era

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Should Understand the Harm of Misusing the Body

To obtain happiness in marriage and produce offspring to continue the lineage, the first question is whether the bodies are healthy. Originally, the union of men and women is for the exchange of love. The development of this love naturally requires healthy reproductive functions for happiness to be possible.

Therefore, male and female reproductive work is not a shameful thing. If we all seek the ideal of completely detaching ourselves from the physical, we will soon see the extinction of all mankind. Humans are, after all, one of the biological beings. The biological world naturally has two major desires: one is the appetite, and the other is the reproductive desire. These two major desires should be satisfied by us in accordance with the principles of hygiene. If we misuse the body or ignorantly injure the sexual functions related to happiness, the consequences would be unimaginable.

From the life of a couple, one can see the importance of healthy sexual function. It not only brings forth new life, but also, through its medium, the two sexes love and help each other, laying the foundation for love, increasing spiritual understanding, and all sources of happiness can be obtained inexhaustibly from healthy reproductive functions. However, losing the health of this reproductive function yields the opposite result.

Therefore, love between men and women will naturally arise after sexual contact between the two parties. Men, except for complete impotence, can fully enjoy it, but women are not so fortunate. The reproductive pleasure they receive is entirely in the hands of their husbands. If they encounter a husband who is physically weak, has premature ejaculation, or is impotent and underdeveloped, then the sweet dream will vanish.

Such problems of premature ejaculation and weakness should not be left untreated. As for the causes of such diseases, in addition to excessive masturbation and early marriage, they are mainly due to indulgence and licentiousness after marriage. At this time, one should actively take male "Bu Ti Kang", a preparation made from the sperm essence of strong animal testicles, to restore the original healthy physiology. "Bu Ti Kang" was invented by the German physiologist Dr. Meulen. In addition to the sperm essence of strong animal testicles as the main ingredient, it also contains phosphorus for brain nourishment, iron for blood nourishment, and calcium for bone nourishment. Therefore, it functions to promote the prosperity of every cell and nourish the whole body. It is most effective for treating premature ejaculation, impotence, and underdeveloped genitals. Its female "Bu Ti Kang" functions to regulate menstruation and promote fertility, with miraculous effects.

### Explanation of New Gonorrhea Medication

— Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang, PhD (USA)

Modern medicine is scientific medicine, and everything must be based on (1) science. Today, the market is flooded with gonorrhea medications, often with cleverly invented names, always labeling their names as new drugs to attract attention and seek sales. As a result, patients not only waste money in vain but also delay treatment. This is because the treatment of gonorrhea, whether new or old, always aims to fundamentally resolve the pathogen of gonorrhea, because the patient's purpose is to relieve their pain, regardless of whether the drug is new or old. For example, the specific medicine for syphilis, "606," was invented decades ago and is still the leader among syphilis drugs. No matter how new the newly produced syphilis drugs are, they are difficult to match "606." We can now use the same reason to explain that "Ke Lin Nong" (available in Chinese and English) is an authority among oral medications for gonorrhea. "Ke Lin Nong" is the result of Dr. Peter of Germany devoting more than 30 years of his efforts, going through countless failures, countless improvements, and trial results, finally achieving the final success and inventing the "Ke Lin Nong" drug, which has been around for many years. Its position in the treatment of gonorrhea is like the brilliance of 606 in the treatment of syphilis, lasting and new, using actual efficacy to defeat all false new brand inferior drugs. For all acute initial gonorrhea and chronic old gonorrhea, only need to take "Ke Lin Nong" medicine, and effective results can be seen within four hours, because the anti-gonorrhea and antibacterial effects of "Ke Lin Nong" reach the lesion directly with the circulation of blood, anti-killing gonorrhea bacteria, and other general brand new inferior drugs, once entering the digestive organs, are excreted from the body, only stimulating the stomach and intestines and having nothing to do with the treatment of gonorrhea. Therefore, from the standpoint of our medical experts, the newest gonorrhea medicine is only "Ke Lin Nong" enough to be worthy of it, and other so-called new drugs are just verbal terms.

### The Relationship Between Impotence and Offspring

— Zheng, PhD (Germany)

Patient Zou ××, from Jiashan, Zhejiang, lives in Yongkang Lane, Alabaster Road, New Garbage Bridge, Shanghai (chief complaint) - unmarried at the age of twenty-nine, due to getting married too early and excessive sexual activity. Since marriage, in addition to a daughter who died young, he has not had children for thirteen years. He suffers from nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, impotence, and weak erections, and viscous secretions flow out after urination. In recent years, his body has become weaker, his spirit is sluggish, and the love between husband and wife is not good. He begs for treatment. (Treatment process) - Prostate massage, electrotherapy for fifteen minutes every day, cold water friction on the local area before going to bed, and taking three "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Pills" to stop nocturnal emission, and during the day, male "Bu Ti Kang", a strong animal testicular sperm essence tonic, was given in three doses in the morning, noon, and evening to nourish yin and tonify the kidneys. A total of two months of medication, sixty-five electrotherapy sessions, and cold water massage were maintained for a long time. The above-mentioned symptoms of weakness gradually disappeared. He felt energetic in the morning, his appetite increased, and his genitals were strongly erected. He had intercourse twice in the meantime, and he said that he had completely restored his reproductive function. Last month, Mr. Zou introduced his friend to the clinic, and he said: His wife is already five months pregnant, and he expressed his gratitude.

### Case of Tuberculosis Treatment

— Diagnosis by Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Patient Qian Xueliang, from Songjiang, is 41 years old (self-report). He has been weak since childhood and likes to drink. Two years ago, in winter, he attended a friend's wedding banquet and returned drunk. At that time, it was late at night, and he caught a cold. Since then, he has been coughing incessantly. By last spring, there was a lot of thick phlegm and chest pain. Although he had been treated, it was ineffective. Last fall, there was a sudden discovery of blood spots in the phlegm, and he was sweating profusely at night, so he came to me for treatment. (Treatment process) I observed that Mr. Qian's face was pale, he was as thin as a stick, and he had a high fever. An X-ray examination revealed a silver coin-sized cavity in his right lung lobe. I instructed him to abstain from alcohol and eat nutritious food and rest at home. "Bu Fei Na Er" was given to make up for the cavities. After two months, the cough had been cured, and the chest pain and night sweats were gone. Taking it to this day, all symptoms have disappeared, no blood in the sputum has been found, and health has been restored.

Talks on Gonorrhea

### Special Treatment for Gonorrheal Cystitis

— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

Gonorrheal cystitis is caused by improper and inferior surgical procedures for local washing in patients with acute or chronic gonorrhea, or by holding urine and engaging in sexual intercourse in chronic gonorrhea. All of these can cause gonococci to invade the internal bladder. Patients experience pain in the lower abdomen, frequent urination, turbid urine, and even blood in the urine. Day after day, the virus becomes very strong. If it is not treated early, the original bacteria of gonorrhea will further invade the kidneys, resulting in gonorrheal pyelonephritis. In this way, the disease becomes more serious. Rescue must be swift, because the spread of gonorrhea is becoming more and more serious, and there is a risk of complications. However, one must be cautious about such treatments. If general local therapies or transmucosal bactericidal therapies are used again, they will not help, and there will be a risk of making repeated mistakes. Be careful.

In short, the sooner gonorrheal cystitis is treated, the better. For the treatment of gonorrheal cystitis, I first use scientific methods to examine the location of the lesion, and after diagnosing the location of the lesion, I use the specific gonorrhea medicine "Ke Lin Nong" (available in Chinese and English), and German static electricity therapy, X-ray electrotherapy, etc., are used in combination. In this way, cystitis in acute gonorrhea can be cured in two weeks, and if it has become chronic cystitis, it can also be cured in three or four weeks. I have twenty years of experience in the treatment of gonorrhea, and whether it is internal medicine, surgery, or electrotherapy, I can treat it according to the symptoms and achieve rapid results. After the above treatment methods, the symptoms of gonorrheal cystitis can be quickly reduced or even cured in a short period of time, and there is no failure. Clinic hours: 10 am to 6 pm. From today, twenty numbers are sent to the clinic every day, and each number only costs five cents, and a copy of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan is given.

Food, Clothing, Housing, and Transportation

### Interesting Anecdotes

— Yong

The residents of Annam, especially Anxi, love to wear black clothes. Also, when it comes to food, they like to eat spicy things, and can be said to be on par with the people of Hunan.

In the Malay Archipelago, there is a peculiar custom: every year, during the last month, except for drinking and eating, they call it the "Fasting Festival," which is said to have been passed down from the time when the Eunuch Sanbao, Zheng He, went to the Nanyang.

Among the trains of various countries, Britain is crowned with the speed of special express trains, France is known for the comfort of the carriages, and the United States provides the most attentive service to passengers, and no country can surpass them.

Leather hats are usually worn in winter. However, Mongolia is different. Regardless of spring or summer, the people of Mongolia wear leather hats. They also like to drink tea very much, and a young man can sometimes drink more than thirty cups in a row.

Bananas, as we all know, are a sweet fruit. In Nanyang, they can also be used as one of the delicacies in desserts. The method is to boil the bananas with sugar, or dip them in flour batter and fry them in oil.

Among the uniforms of soldiers from all over the world, those of German General Goering are the most, and those of Chinese General Feng Yuxiang are the least.

### Transportation in Shaoxing

— Gang

Since Xiaoshan, which is as closely related to Shaoxing as lips are to teeth, has fallen, Shaoxing has inevitably been affected. Although the market was once calm, it has now recovered its prosperity. Let me talk about transportation in Shaoxing.

Shaoxing has many rivers, so boat traffic is particularly developed. Wealthy families always have boats, like small chartered cars in Shanghai. Farming families have at least one small boat of their own. In addition, there are harbor boats that travel back and forth between the city and the countryside, with fixed routes and berths. As long as you spend a few copper coins, you can take a ride. Because it is cheap and convenient, there are many passengers.

Harbor boats are very large, with rows of long benches inside. There is no first or second class. There are at least two boatmen rowing. A wooden board is inserted on the bow of the boat, with the destination and the places where it stops written on the board. These boats usually come from the countryside and then return in the afternoon. Some of the afternoon departures still row to the city, but they always row back in the evening. Some have to carry burdens because of the long distance. Every morning at nine or ten o'clock, the city gate is sometimes crowded and impassable. They call it "Harbor Boats on the Market." When the boat sets off, the boatman holds a small gong and knocks it while calling out. It gradually stops only after rowing far away.

In addition to harbor boats, there is also a kind of "Jian Jiang Boat." This kind of boat is very small, with two oars, one used by hand and one used by foot. Only three or five people can sit on it. Inside the boat is a straw mat, and the passengers sit on the mat. The boatman rows with his hands and pushes with his feet, very quickly. Because harbor boats have time constraints, people always take this kind of small boat when they miss the bus. Also, because it is fast, people who have urgent matters also need it. However, it is not used when the wind is strong and the river is wide.

As for rickshaws, there are also many in Shaoxing. The rickshaw poles are equipped with bells. If you walk on the road, the noisy ringing will always make you tired. Because there are many rivers, there are also many bridges, and they are very high. When the rickshaw passes over a bridge, the rickshaw puller sometimes asks you if you want to get off the car. For safety, we always get off the car to cross the bridge.

There are not many cars in Shaoxing city, perhaps because there are few roads and many bridges, but compared to the past, there are many more now.

Due to environmental factors, boats and rickshaws have become important means of transportation in Shaoxing, especially boats.

### Dyeing Clothes

— Xi

After old clothes are dyed in a favorite color at a dyeing shop, they are like new. As for the various aspects of dyeing clothes, they are not familiar to outsiders.

The dyes used in dyeing shops are mostly purchased from Xiangnei Gate or Defu. The types and uses are as follows:

(1) Direct Union can dye cotton, wool, silk, and other fabrics.

(2) Sulphur Colour can dye cotton fabrics.

(3) Basic Colour can dye wool and silk fabrics.

(4) Basie Colour can dye wool, cotton, and silk fabrics.

(5) Chromc Colour can dye wool fabrics.

(6) Vat Colour can dye wool fabrics.

Among them, Vat Colour is the best. The clothes dyed with this dye will never fade, like the Indanthrene cloth and crepe de chine on the market.

Regarding the method of dyeing clothes, the clothes are usually first immersed in a prepared dye liquid, and then a quantitative amount of sulfuric acid, acetic acid, and salt are added as three dyeing aids. In this way, they are dyed at a temperature of 40 degrees for about half an hour, and finally they are rinsed with warm water and dried.

However, those who work inside are not only exposed to odors, but their hands and faces are also often easily splashed and injured.

### New Residential Area Under Construction in Guiyang

— Jing Sheng

Guiyang, known as the mountain country, was not very large to begin with. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, Guiyang has become an important town in the southwest, and its population has suddenly increased more than forty times. As a result, there has been a problem of "housing" difficulties; and after several major bombings by Japanese aircraft, many houses have been destroyed, and the problem of housing has become more serious.

Now, in addition to trying to evacuate the population to other places as much as possible, the Guiyang authorities are also planning to build the scenic area of ​​the Nanming River into a residential area. The planned Nanming River residential area is located in the southwest of Qianling Mountain in the eastern suburbs of Guiyang City, and the Nanming River surrounds it like jade. The area is comparable to the urban area, covering an area of ​​13,900 square meters, divided into 140 households. The construction cost is set at 313,000 yuan, which is entirely allocated from the income from the actual land. If it is insufficient, the government will subsidize it.

The residential area is not allowed to have theaters, hotels, or restaurants, and it is planned to create a clean, peaceful, and ideal new village. In addition to opening a central park in the central location for residents to relax, public places such as small vegetable markets, post offices, libraries, and small schools are built using the stone materials of Qianling Mountain, the fine sand of the Nanming River, and the wood in the mountains; as for water, electricity, docks, streetcars, and other public utilities, there are also complete rules, everything that should be available, as perfect as possible.

This residential area started construction in May of the 27th year and is expected to be completed this autumn. At that time, the ancient Guiyang will be renovated and will have a new look.

### "Fleas" That Should Be Cleared in the Battlefield Are Faster Than Swordsmen and Fiercer Than Lions

— Zhong Zhi

Human life is full of competition. The European War that occurred 25 years ago involved 42 ethnic groups and lasted for four years. In the central cities of the European continent, fleas, bedbugs, and petty clowns rampant and caused disasters wherever the army went, like a prairie fire, with contagious diseases being transmitted to each other. Some say that pests and the fear of insects are the great enemies of human beings. Since the beginning of history to the present day, the struggle between human beings and pests has never ceased. The reproduction of insects is extremely numerous and fast. If they do not devour each other, then the legacy of a few insects, after one or two years, through the derivation and distribution of millions of grandchildren, can cover the Atlantic Ocean. Occasionally, the world and the great war are encountered, and human beings kill each other. Because there is no human defense, pests must take advantage of the opportunity to be aggressive, which is inevitable. The beginning of the Second European War was in the autumn. The scope and speed of the war in the European continent is not as good as in the past. The insect infestation 25 years ago is deeply hoped not to be seen again today. However, in our country, the development of material civilization is not as good as that of Europe. The elimination of insect infestation during the war should be given the same priority as the problem of epidemic prevention. Among the pests, the most resistant is the flea. Insecticidal powders such as "Fly Killing Down" sold on the market are often not enough to repel fleas. European flea experts once said, "Fleas do not choose a place and are very easy to survive. They especially like to gather on the bodies of women. Fleas have six legs. Their two hind legs near the abdomen have sound-producing organs, which can often chirp like grasshoppers, but the chirping is weak and cannot be detected by us. Only fleas can hear it."

Fleas are blind and have poor eyesight, but like bees, they know how to distinguish between light and darkness, and their habits only like to go to dark places. In Western-style homes, the indoor light is sufficient, which is very convenient for preventing the concealment of fleas. Fleas are not good at climbing but good at jumping. A tiny worm can jump as far as 30 centimeters (about one-third of a meter) or even 50 centimeters (half a meter) away, and can also jump as high as 10 centimeters. If a long jump master in our sports world can jump as well as a flea, then he can jump off the ground from the South Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and fall into the Shanghai Public Concession Racecourse. Therefore, the flea's jumping ability is even better than that of a swordsman.

Not only that, although fleas are afraid of cold and dry, they are resistant to hunger. If they are in a warm climate and live in a humid place, they can starve for a year without dying. However, they do not eat hungry fleas that have been hungry for a full year. Occasionally, they bite human skin, and they are as fierce as hungry roaring lions. They can ingest half a cubic millimeter of human blood in one frantic suck. If they are not disturbed or chased away, they can stick to it for more than 20 minutes, up to two hours.

People who are troubled by fleas find it difficult to catch them, and it is even more difficult to kill them. A good way to catch fleas is to quickly press the itchy spot and rub it vigorously, or use a wet hand to accurately hold it. The captured fleas cannot be killed by pinching with one finger. If you are afraid of being escaped again in a hurry, you should immediately drown them in water. However, you must not bite them to death with your teeth like the natives of tropical Africa, because you are afraid of accidentally biting dog fleas that affect the human body and infecting the roundworm disease in the dog's intestines. There are many kinds of fleas. In addition to human fleas Pulex irritans, there are also sand fleas, dog fleas, cat fleas, monkey fleas, chicken fleas, rat fleas, and hedgehogs, which are all bred on the ground. However, flat and horse fleas often cover the blankets on horses' backs and can use the smell of horses to repel fleas.

The root of the flea disaster is the most difficult to eradicate. The larvae usually live in the cracks in the floor, relying on the help of humidity to develop. In recent years, Western houses have been equipped with central heaters circulating throughout the room (commonly known as heating pipes). Through winter and spring, the floor becomes dry, which can unknowingly eliminate the flea breeding route. What is even more wonderful is that the floors of Western houses are mostly not washed with water but wiped with oil, and oilcloth is covered on the floor, and thick carpets are laid on the oilcloth. All these facilities are new with the progress of material civilization, all of which are no less than being enemies with fleas. The most exquisite houses have bathrooms and bathe more frequently. How can fleas not disappear?

As for our country, the financial resources may not be enough to lay carpets and install central heaters. If you want to permanently eliminate flea infestation in your home, you may as well buy carbolic acid from Western pharmacies (carbolic acid is poisonous, do not mix a small amount of carbolic acid with 20 parts of clean water (that is, a ratio of 5 to 100) of carbolic acid to form a milky white carbolic acid solution with a strong odor (commonly known as stinky water), take it to pour and wash the floor, deep liquid seeps into the cracks in the floor and the larvae are killed, and the source of fleas is eliminated, not only can the residents of the home rest easy, but also increase the spirit of governing affairs and increase the efficiency of diligent work. As for the invisible pathogens of mite insects, and the plague bacilli smaller than mite insects, etc., all those who rely on the flea body to cause disaster to mankind can be eliminated in one fell swoop, which is a sincere plan.

Spring and Autumn

### Do You Want Your Store to Flourish?

— Quan

An American company once had an owner who specially spent money to have employees learn to "smile." In the eyes of Chinese people, this owner seems so foolish, but the result was that the company's sales increased by 10%.

This may seem strange, but it's not surprising. This is a well-deserved reward for spending money to care for employees! However, short-sighted Chinese businessmen find it hard to realize this. Nowadays, the staff in Chinese companies and shops have low levels of knowledge and are poorly treated. The owners do not care for their employees in any way. The material and spiritual suffering they endure inevitably leads to depression, irritability... which affects business.

Owners of companies and shops! Do you want your business to flourish? This is truly a major issue that cannot be ignored!

Improving treatment can encourage employees to feel secure about their families and focus on their work, and it can also prevent fraud and embezzlement. The boss's care and attention to employees will surely inspire employees' enthusiasm for their work. If the boss can further enhance the knowledge of employees, the result will not only make employees grateful, but also help the business. The cost is extremely minimal, and the gains are enormous. As long as you have foresight, your business will immediately flourish.

Do you want your store to flourish? Your employees are indeed powerful helpers for your success! Pay attention to your employees, care for your employees, help your employees, and treat your employees well. I believe you will definitely succeed!

### Save Them From the Sea of Suffering

— Inhumane

Hoping to Establish a Special Hospital for Quitting Smoking

I have a relative who contracted a bad habit due to illness. After recovering, he deeply regretted not being able to escape this new "demon." Recently, he made up his mind to quit the bad habit, but his family is not wealthy and he is a salaried employee. Naturally, he cannot afford to go to a more reliable hospital to seek help. So, he secretly searched in the corners of newspapers for cheap doctors who "guarantee to quit opium" and "break addiction in ten days."

Now, nearly three months have passed, and he has already changed three doctors. The methods of the first two almost made him sick again. The latter one, although not painful at all, required taking the medicine as often as smoking. He suspects that the medicine is just a "substitute" and cannot break his addiction. Therefore, he has fallen into a very painful situation.

During the Anti-Japanese War, under the spread of the poisoning policy, people who are sinking in the sea of suffering should immediately wake up and quit their bad habits. But people like my relative, they don't have extra money to hire reliable doctors, and they have to continue working to maintain their lives. So, they are groping in the dark, trying to escape the sea of suffering but failing.

Therefore, I believe that all major hospitals should take on this important responsibility. They should add a special department for quitting smoking to serve these poor people. In addition to recovering the cost of the medicine, all handling fees should be waived. For the extremely poor, each hospital should provide a certain number of free places to help them quit. It would be even better if a special hospital for quitting smoking could be established. As for funding, it may be raised from all sectors of society.

Secondly, the authorities in the two concessions should pay attention to those irresponsible doctors and all speculative "quit smoking medicines" at any time, conduct investigations and tests, and impose severe penalties if the above situations are discovered.

### Thinking from Tin Foil Ashes

The day before yesterday, the thirtieth day of the second lunar month, I saw a pile of tin foil ashes at the door of a house, and then I thought of a story:

"Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man in England who had a strange habit, and it became a habit, that is, he had to personally burn a one-pound note every day."

Would you be afraid that he has some mental illness? That's what I think too, but after thinking carefully, there is not much difference between him and burning tin foil, but it is just a difference between direct and indirect; fortunately, these outdated things under the times have gradually decreased, but another kind of fashionable and common cigarettes has risen instead, whether it is socializing with guests, making families, social occasions, and even schools, all become smoky; and some people just want to smoke, and the number of people smoking is increasing day by day. I don't know what benefits it has. I only see advertisements in newspapers such as "fragrant and refreshing," "spiritually boosted," "accelerated work," etc. In fact, what doctors tell us daily and what we see in books are all dissuasions and warnings with the opposite intention. Therefore, I can't tell what is different between this and burning tin foil.

I hope that people who smoke cigarettes will not think that my idea is too bizarre. Please think carefully about whether it is harmful without any benefit. Then please reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke until you don't smoke, which will be beneficial to personal health. Although the amount of one person is small, the power of the masses is great. This is beneficial and harmless to both people and oneself. Readers who smoke cigarettes, please think it over carefully.

### Jesus and the City (3)

(5) Jesus wept for the city. As Jesus approached the city, He saw many other sins. He cried with sorrow for the slums. The crowd was shouting "Hosanna" loudly, but when they heard Jesus weeping, they stopped shouting. Jesus' weeping was not only the weeping of a patriot seeing the impending destruction of his country, but also the weeping of a savior seeing the chosen people He came to redeem tending to destruction. "You did not know the day of your visitation." Jesus came to save them, but they refused to accept Him. The gospel that Jesus brought them, the example He set for them, all of this they did not care about, but instead despised. Therefore, Jesus wept. Now that we see the sins of the city, many people are walking corpses, not knowing right from wrong, we must weep aloud for them. (6) Hurry to make amends. After weeping bitterly, Jesus still felt it was not enough, and immediately went to rescue. He went into the temple and drove out all those who were making the temple a den of thieves. When we see a sin, it is not enough to weep bitterly; we must immediately find ways to remedy it. The first step is to cleanse the church of God, "for judgment must begin at the house of God," because the church is the stream of salvation. If it is blocked by sin, then the life-giving water of saving people will have no way to flow freely. All those who preach according to their own opinions; who are saints on Sundays, but act recklessly on weekdays; who teach people in Sunday school, but swear oaths in the office; who praise God on Sundays, but curse the poor on weekdays; who act righteously in front of people, but do anything behind their backs; all these people, if Jesus saw them, would be driven out. (7) Keep teaching people. After Jesus wept, He taught people in the city every day. For the sins of the city, worldly salvation methods, such as the one mentioned earlier, still do not work; we must still strive in terms of sacrifice. In other words, the city needs education, laws, etc., but even more so the divine word that has the power to transform people. Therefore, we must imitate Jesus and proclaim the holy word every day. Do not preach on Sundays and not on weekdays; do it every day as it should be. May every Christian become a living testimony. If we continue to do this, the city will surely be improved one day. (End) If you would like to inquire in detail, please write to P.O. Box 1227.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter 22 News Reports Fly in from Beyond the Horizon Lofty Discussions and Grand Theories are Believed Among People

Everyone laughed when they saw Shao Huihua's appearance, saying, "She's really a naughty girl." Qu Wubian said, "I believe what Dr. Zhu said. There is a deputy editor in our newspaper office who used to be a war correspondent. In the remote villages and humble houses of the battlefield, news was obtained in this way. With a radio and a mimeograph machine, the day's news could be spread to the public. However, going in and out of gunfire and living a life like the military is arduous, arduous, arduous! It is really different from now. Now, being a journalist, whether it is indoor or outdoor work, is still a life of comfort and ease in society." Zhu Airen said, "People say that newspapers rely on advertising, not on circulation. We don't run newspapers, and we are complete laymen in the news industry. I don't know if this is really the case?" Qu Wubian smiled and said, "Perhaps there was such a phenomenon in the past, but it is not so now. Newspapers still rely on circulation. Even in the era when they relied on advertising, it was indirectly relying on circulation. Think about it, if your newspaper has too few sales, who would come to place advertisements in your paper? Even in our newspaper office, although we cannot obtain much profit from circulation, we do not lose money. There are several reasons for this: First, the price of paper is cheaper. More than ten years ago, Chinese newspapers were foreign goods, and we inevitably suffered losses in foreign exchange and freight. At this moment, there are already several dozens of large and small paper mills in China, and there are also six or seven companies specializing in paper manufacturing. Originally, China has rich forests and convenient water conservancy, which is a good place for papermaking. Why don't we develop it ourselves? Since we use paper from domestic paper mills, the cost is naturally saved a lot, and what's more, several large newspaper offices have cooperative relationships with paper mills. Second, the regulation of paper. Now the largest newspapers at most publish four large sheets. According to the current prosperity of Chinese industry and commerce and the development of culture, even if we publish ten large sheets every day, it is possible. Because of the prosperity of industry and commerce, there are many advertisements, and because of the development of culture, there is no worry about the lack of materials in the newspaper. However, newspapers are read by people every day, and it is not too much to save people's energy. Also, those advertisements are limited to occupying only four-tenths of the paper surface, and the advertising fees are naturally several times higher than before. Third, the government and newspaper offices provide various conveniences. Such as low postal rates, reduced telegram and telephone fees, etc., newspapers are regarded as a national cultural propaganda undertaking, and are given preferential treatment everywhere. This expense is also reduced a lot compared to the past. Combining these factors, the price of paper is cheap, the paper is less, and the consumption is saved. In circulation, it is possible not to lose money. What's more, although advertisements are only allowed to occupy four-tenths of the paper surface, it is still a huge income!" (263)

Dear Editor! I hope this article can be published in Chunqiu. I think that in addition to a small number of people who voluntarily harm their own lives, people like my relative must account for the vast majority. We should cry out for them and save them from the sea of suffering!

### Lamenting General Ming Gong

— Lan Hui

Spirits of the land gathered in Qilu, For twenty years you opened your office as supreme commander. Through the northern deserts and the Ao Yang Pass, You were called a father and mother of the people. Like Fan and Han, you restrained the enemy's core, A majestic barrier of the golden urn. The Great Wall's horses drank, Shamed to wield the jade axe, The Dadu River was without waves. Who knew that the flames of calamity would fly, The barbarian flute would suddenly sound, How painful that loyal blood splattered, In a hundred battles you led the way. Reading history, I hate the strength of the Xiongnu, Great achievements await inscription on the Yanran Pillar.

Your righteousness reached the clouds, Once, from accumulated labor, you showed illness, Following south of the Yangtze River, the mountains of Yue, the ranges of Brazil, Righteousness forced you to drive. Like Qu and Jia, you threw your poems and sobbed, As the Iron Pledge was issued. You slaughtered whales in the sea, Registered Xun and Ban, Slept in the snow in empty mountains. The imperial army's banners remain unsettled, Family sacrifices are hard to forget, Sadly, the five-zhang star falls, The nine heavens' coffin descends, Feeling the passing of a hero, Following the tears, I newly add the Xian Tablet.

Malaria

### The Most Widely Spread Disease! M.Ch.23 — Jin

The Method of Taking That Frost Special Effect Rong

Malaria, this disease, is more prone to epidemics in various tropical and subtropical regions. In temperate climates, farmers are more susceptible to its transmission during malaria season. Therefore, it is extremely easy to find its stubbornness in coastal areas and coastal harbors. We must know that "malaria" is a devastating disease, and we must strictly prevent it in our daily lives, because it can destroy our health and cause loss of life. In some places, the discovery of malaria is a huge loss, which can destroy workers and hinder work. Especially in botanical gardens, when workers are working, contracting this disease will reduce work and strongly destroy it. The result is that millions of people live daily and are harmed by malaria. For example, according to statistics from American author Howard in 1909, three million people in the United States were infected with malaria that year, and the cost of death, expenses, and losses was about one-tenth of a million yuan in US dollars. The number is really big, and Ronald Ross calculated that in British India, as many as 1.3 million people die from malaria every year, which is even more terrifying than the United States. Another obvious example is that farmers in Danish East India have also repeatedly been threatened and harmed by it. Although they have tried their best to prevent it, they cannot avoid it and cannot escape its harm. In many other places, problems arise with this disease, such as: "Is it real malaria or not malaria" and "has it been discovered or not discovered". These two questions are parallel and passed on by word of mouth. Everyone luckily tries to believe that it has not been discovered or is not true, so they can rest assured, but many people die among them! According to Professor Garnier of the University of Amsterdam, malaria is the main cause of death among the people of Danish East India and the most widely spread disaster. The professor also strongly determined that we have long discovered drugs to treat malaria to resist it. If you take a certain amount of "quinine frost" when you have malaria, this disease is not a stubborn disease that is difficult to cure. Because of the efficacy of "quinine frost" medicine, it is specially designed to prevent the rampant of malaria. The modern good method for preventing and treating malaria is to quickly eat "quinine frost", which is also the method introduced to the world by the League of Nations Committee for the purpose of preventing and treating the disease. Malaria patients take quinine frost 15-18 watts daily for a period of 5-7 days, and the disease will be cured forever. If you get it again, take the same amount as before, and take a small amount daily during the malaria period to prevent infection.
