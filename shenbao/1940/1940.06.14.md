### Allied Counter-Offensive Progresses North of Paris; France Declares Paris an Undefended Zone; British and French Troops Captured Downriver from Seine

Paris: A military spokesperson recently announced that French forces achieved a successful counter-offensive in the Senlis area, advancing 5.5 miles. Senlis is located 26 miles north of Paris. The German offensive on September 5, 1914, was halted in that area. (Havas urgent dispatch, 13th)

Paris: The High Command issued a war bulletin tonight: "The battle at the front line remains extremely fierce today. The situation on each front is generally as follows: (1) After intensifying their attack on the Seine River, the enemy had already occupied a bridgehead on the south bank. Now they have concentrated a large number of troops and are advancing along the river from Rouen towards Vernon, attempting to expand their foothold. Simultaneously, attacks on Évreux (southwest of Vernon) and Bazoches on the Cure River were thwarted by our forces. In addition, enemy scout units are advancing towards Gaillon on the north bank of the Seine. (2) Downstream on the Oise River, our forces made contact with the enemy in the Beaumont area. Enemy vanguard units between the Oise River and the Ourcq Canal are fiercely attacking Crépy-en-Valois and Betz. (3) On the Marne River front, the enemy has crossed to the south bank near Château-Thierry. (4) On the Reims front, the enemy has continued to deploy tank units. Thus, the enemy's mechanized forces operating in the area include three or four tank divisions and two or three motorized divisions. After fierce fighting with the enemy, our forces have been ordered to retreat from the hills around Reims, adopting a steady and cautious strategy, taking each step firmly. To the northeast of the city, our forces captured many enemy soldiers who confessed that the enemy suffered heavy losses after our large-scale counter-offensive by mechanized units and repeated bombings by our aircraft. (5) Our air force engaged in combat with enemy aircraft five times today, and all aircraft have returned to base. (6) There was no enemy attack between the Aisne and the Marne rivers. Nothing to report." (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Paris: The High Command issued a war bulletin this morning: "The fighting along the entire line from the coast to the Argonne region remains extremely intense. The large-scale offensive adopted by the enemy, namely the encirclement of Paris from the lower Seine River on the left flank and the Marne River basin on the right flank, has been bravely resisted and thwarted by our forces. However, there are no major changes in the overall situation at the front." (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Tours: Due to the intense pressure exerted by the German army on all Allied fronts, the French command this morning withdrew its troops from the area between Compiègne and Noyon to shorten the defensive line and established a new defensive line north of Senlis. The most intense German attacks are in the lower Seine River and Reims areas, as the Germans attempt to complete their encirclement from the west in these locations. The Germans have now committed 120 divisions into full-scale operations, desperately attempting to reach Paris as quickly as possible. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

General Dentz Succeeds as Military Governor of Paris

Paris: Military Governor General Herrgott issued a proclamation this morning: "I have been ordered to be transferred to the command of an army corps, and General Dentz will succeed me as Military Governor. The city has been declared an undefended open city, and various measures have been taken to ensure the safety of residents and guarantee an uninterrupted food supply." (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Paris: The city is completely under the control of military authorities. The evacuation of residents is almost complete. Those who remain are calmly awaiting the development of the situation, and everything indicates their determination. All bakeries, pharmacies, and food stores inside and outside the city have been requisitioned by the military authorities. Any employees of these establishments who dare to desert will be subject to military law. All national defense factories are operating as usual. Workers are using bicycles instead of buses and trams, which have been suspended. All taxis have been hired by refugees. All drivers must declare that they will return after transporting refugees and are not allowed to leave the city. A total of two million refugees have evacuated Paris to the south and have been repeatedly bombed and strafed by German aircraft en route. (Havas news agency dispatch, 13th)

Stockholm: According to "Aftonbladet", German forces have reached the northern suburbs of Paris. Motorized units and other elite troops are rapidly advancing close behind the vanguard. The most pressing question at the moment is whether to defend or abandon Paris. If Paris is occupied by the Germans, it will have a significant psychological impact. The German side hopes that the French authorities will follow the example of Brussels and avoid using the capital as a battlefield. However, the French side is unlikely to declare Paris an undefended city. If France cannot change the course of the war by defending Paris, it may not want to turn the capital into scorched earth. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)

Paris: A notice was posted on the walls of Paris this morning: "Paris is an undefended city. The authorities have taken all steps to ensure the safety of residents and the supply of food under all circumstances." (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

London: Authoritative sources in Britain and France have denied reports that German forces have occupied Paris and that the French government and the French command are planning to make a separate peace. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

Paris: The Military Governor of Paris, General Herrgott, has issued an order stating that all employees of public utilities in the Seine-et-Oise and Seine-et-Marne departments must not leave their posts without authorization. Those employees who are reservists are temporarily exempt from military service due to their involvement in special national defense work. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

German Troops Advance in Three Routes on the Outskirts of Paris

Paris: A spokesperson for the High Command recently stated that the situation on the front lines today can be described in several aspects: (A) Regarding the outer defense line of Paris, it can be divided into three routes: (1) On the northeastern front of Paris, the enemy is attempting to attack Reims with heavy forces to complete the left flank of their plan to encircle Paris in a semicircle, thereby cutting off the connection between the Maginot Line and the main French forces. The enemy forces in that area consist of five infantry divisions and two mechanized divisions, but our forces are firmly defending their positions and have not moved. (2) On the northern front of Paris, fierce fighting is taking place from Senlis in the Oise River basin (32 miles from Paris) to the area between La Ferté-Milon and La Ferté-sous-Jouarre. On the Marne River front, our forces have retreated to the line from Château-Thierry to Meaux. (3) On the western front of Paris, the enemy has forcibly crossed the Seine River near Vernon. Our forces are bravely counter-attacking, hoping to force them back to the north bank. (B) Regarding the war between France and Italy, there is no activity along the Italian border in the Alps. A railway bridge near Ventimiglia in Italy has been destroyed by the Italian government. The bridge is only five miles from the French border and is the only route from San Remo in Italy to Nice in France. In addition, it is reported that the Italian government has mobilized 60 to 70 army divisions, but our positions have also been prepared. (Havas dispatch, 12th)

Paris: Military sources here recently stated that the German combat forces have reached more than 100 divisions and that all of their motorized vehicles have been fully deployed for military use. The German high command apparently intends to make a desperate gamble between the lower Seine River and the Argonne region to destroy our forces' resistance in one fell swoop. The enemy is continuously transporting tanks and various vehicles from within their country to the front lines. Even training tanks are being deployed. As for the situation on each front today, it can be summarized as follows: (1) On the front lines in the Argonne region, large enemy forces have attempted to cut off the connection between that area and the Maginot Line, continuously bombarding our positions near the Rethel River. However, our forces remain unmoved, and the enemy has not taken a single step. (2) The enemy is advancing from east of Rethel, attempting to directly attack Reims. Our forces in the area north and west of the Aisne River are engaging the enemy. (3) Our forces near the Compiegne River have been ordered to withdraw and deploy defenses between Compiègne, Noyon, and Soissons due to the high command's desire to defend Paris and avoid unnecessary sacrifices.

Editorial

### Unease in American Government and Public Opinion

"The American government and public opinion are feeling a sense of urgent and profound unease." This was frankly stated by President Roosevelt after Italy declared war on Britain and France.

Roosevelt's talent and achievements have created a distinguished reputation. Even other republics in South America are happy to regard him as their leader. As for his ability to lead the American people and grasp American policy, there is absolutely no doubt. In other words, American policy will be firm and clear and will not be subject to any changes due to any internal difficulties in the United States or the Americas. Roosevelt will be able to overcome all difficulties and ensure that American policy gains universal international trust. It should be carefully noted that America's actions are sufficient to affect the European war, and the far-reaching impact of the European war extends to future generations. Therefore, although American policy is firm and clear, how the policy evolves and the attitude of each stage of the evolution will affect the safety, security, fortune, and misfortune of the United States, the Americas, and the entire international community. Since everything in the United States is based on the spirit of democracy, at this critical juncture of safety, security, fortune, and misfortune, under the urgent and profound unease, and when the political season of the presidential election is about to arrive, one must trust the American policy under the leadership of Roosevelt, and one must not neglect the various dynamics within the United States.

According to recent news reports, various situations in the United States are developing in contradictory ways following the international changes: After the German army achieved repeated victories and Italy joined the war, sympathy for Britain and France in the United States became more widespread and profound. There are more calls for providing them with full assistance, and some even advocate joining the war. At the same time, the isolationists are engaging in their last and most vigorous activity. The United States, citing the need to strengthen its national defense, has banned the export of certain essential military supplies. At the same time, it is providing Britain and France with large quantities of so-called surplus military equipment. Yesterday, it was reported that the United States will transfer 18 or more destroyers to Britain and France. Republican Senator Vandenberg, in the form of a statement, argued that "in order to cope with the new international situation, the United States should make various preparations. Among the most practical is to sign a new commercial treaty and political agreement with Japan to stabilize international relations in the Far East." He believes that "what the United States should deal with in the Far East is reality rather than theory, and in our national defense plan, a peaceful Pacific Ocean is equal to half of our navy." There are countless so-called political commentators who make similar remarks. At the same time, Roosevelt declared that the US fleet will remain stationed in the Pacific indefinitely! All these contradictions are sufficient to provide a concrete explanation for the so-called feeling of urgent and profound unease. Whether individual or group, or society and country, if there is unease, there must be contradiction. The greater the unease, the more intense the contradiction. It must be until the unease gradually becomes quiet, and then the contradiction gradually disappears. This is the norm in all changes. The United States is no exception. Therefore, it is not unexpected that the American government and public opinion feel unease due to international changes and that contradictions are discovered due to the feeling of unease. There is no reason to shake or reduce the trust in American policy that should be held.

The reason why American policy under the leadership of Roosevelt is clear and firm lies in the fact that it is based on the spirit of democracy. Because of this foundation, all kinds of arguments and claims that oppose this policy, even if they are active for a while, will eventually disappear. The opponents say that what the United States should deal with is facts rather than theories. This is the most appealing argument to the pragmatic national character of the United States. However, if the United States formulated policies based on theory, it should have risen up long ago. Why is it still on the sidelines? Without discussing other matters, the US ship Panay was tragically bombed. In North China, in the Yangtze River Basin, and in the Pearl River area, free trade is not permitted. In addition, the number of cases of damage and insult last year has reached more than 600. Which of these are theoretical issues? Which of these are not factual cases? As for the idea that "in the American national defense plan, a peaceful Pacific Ocean is equal to half of the American navy," if peace is obtained through compromise with aggression and violence, then the same peace can be obtained from the Atlantic Ocean, and another half of the navy can be abandoned. This is the most impermissible method in fact. As for hoping to exchange the stability of international relations in the Far East by signing commercial and political agreements, this is to make such fantasies by forgetting the history of betrayal and bad faith. All that can be seen is that people like Vandenberg are just theorists! These types of theorists, whether in fact or in theory, are immature and fragile, insufficient to sway the pragmatic American government and public opinion, and insufficient to shake the clear and firm American policy.

We do not want the United States to participate in the war, whether in Europe or the Far East. Some believe that the result of the United States' participation in the war can shorten the war. We believe that under the premise of the United States not participating in the war, as long as it eliminates all contradictions, implements its policies, and increases the speed of its implementation, it is enough to shorten the war. The existence of contradictions makes the effectiveness offset each other to zero, or at least weakens the effectiveness and delays the effectiveness. Taking the Far East issue as an example, American policy has always been beyond doubt. However, it fundamentally sympathizes with China's resistance war, but still allows military supplies to be supplied to the aggressor country to support the aggression military, and allows continued trade to support the aggression financial resources. Thus, the effectiveness of American policy is minimal and slow. The reason for this is that some unrealistic theories are obstructing it. Although these types of theories are not enough to change American policy, the policy is hindered in its implementation, so that its effectiveness is weakened and delayed, which has indeed given the strong and violent an opportunity to exploit.

French Still Confident in Containing German Offensive

Paris: Although the German forces are currently increasing their pressure, especially in the area between Rouen and Verdun near Reims, the British and French troops are continuing their best efforts to resist the German forces' encroachment on Paris. Although the German forces have made some gains in various places, their progress is becoming increasingly difficult. It is estimated that the entire one hundred and twenty German divisions on the Western Front have been committed to battle, hoping to crush the Allied resistance. However, the French are still confident that the German forces will be contained. The famous commentator Maurice wrote an article published in the Petit Parisien stating that "The time is approaching when General Weygand will mobilize all resources and order the French land and air forces to launch a counter-offensive to drive the enemy out of their positions. General Weygand has never considered the situation to be hopeless." (Reuters dispatch, 12th)

Paris: At 8:00 this morning, the commercial area of Paris was relatively quiet. The German army is now only thirteen miles from the capital. This morning, there were still citizens strolling on the shaded roads, believing that these residents will remain in Paris regardless of any incidents that may occur. However, most of the residents of the capital have fled to the south. Those who remain in the capital still have the last newspaper to provide news this morning. This newspaper is jointly published by Le Journal, Le Matin, and Le Petit Journal. The second page has a warning headline: "Parisians, Beware of Bombing." Judging from the situation around the United Press office, the great evacuation of Paris has been completed. In addition to a few strollers, there are only a few cyclists and carters on the streets. About one hundred citizens are waiting for the bank to open in front of a bank across the street. The blackout last night was even darker and more gloomy than before, due to the fog and the smoke from the battlefield. Police patrolled the streets all night, and any glimmers of light were interfered with by whistles. A reporter from the United Press was stopped from smoking in the corridor of the office. Currently, only one police officer is stationed at each major intersection in the vicinity of the United Press location. There are also fewer soldiers in the city than before. (United Press dispatch, 12th)

Britain Sends Fresh Troops to France as Reinforcements

Paris: Fresh British troops recently arrived from Britain to France have occupied positions on the Seine River and are jointly defending against the enemy with the French army. It is reported that the army's appearance and discipline have had a good influence. The Allied forces, who were resisting the German army's advance day and night, were greatly encouraged by this aid. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

London: Military officials here say Britain has shipped every available soldier, gun, cannon and tank into France to defend against the Germans. Today London reports that the Allies will launch a counter-offensive in France similar to the one in September 1914, which repelled the German attack on Paris. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

British War Office Announces British Troop Captures

Paris: According to recent news, the German army is now attacking Château-Thierry on the Marne River south of Paris. The German army is still being held back in the Château-Thierry area, and it appears that the German army has deployed all of its armored forces in the current battle. News reports indicate the use of flame-throwing tanks by the German side. There is no doubt that the German side has this weapon, but so far no news has been received of its use. Today, news has also been received of large numbers of Italian troops being deployed behind the German front lines in the past two weeks, but officials have not received confirmation of this news. London officials criticized the British War Office's announcement today that a part of a British division in France had been captured, stating that the division was deployed on the left flank of the Somme River in France in May, operating under French command and following General Weygand's plan. On May 28, they jointly attacked the bridgehead defenses of Arras with the French army, but unfortunately achieved only partial success. Subsequently, two divisions of German armored troops invaded the Poix area and advanced towards Rouen. The British division then retreated slowly with the French army to the Bresle River line, where they held for several days before making a strategic retreat to the Béthune River, where they held their ground. No further news was received of the army's movements, but it was learned that two brigades of the division had turned back to help defend the port of Le Havre, while the remaining troops joined the French forces in the north and later retreated southwestward. Realizing that the road to Rouen had been cut off by the German armored forces, they retreated to Saint-Valery-en-Caux, where several French troops had already been surrounded. The attacking German forces numbered four divisions, including one armored division. The rocky coastline there is different from the broad beaches of Dunkirk, and unfortunately, a thick fog covered the sea on the night of the evacuation, so that only a small number were able to board ships, and finally surrendered out of desperation. As for the other two brigades of the British division ordered to turn back to Le Havre, they have all boarded ships and landed elsewhere in France. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### German War Report

Hitler's Headquarters: The British and French forces trapped in Saint-Valery were forced to surrender. In this operation, the German army captured one British general, five French generals, and more than 26,000 prisoners, as well as countless weapons and supplies. An enemy transport ship left the port of Saint-Valery, but was forced to return by German artillery fire. Another enemy ship was set on fire by a German tank shell. The German army pursued the enemy and occupied Châlons, crossed the battlefield of 1915, and made progress between Argonne and the Lesse River. Since June 5, the enemy has captured no less than 100,000 people. Two teams of German forces on the western wing have captured and destroyed more than 200 enemy tanks.

### Intense Fighting Around Yichang; Chinese Troops Recapture Yu'an County; Over 2,400 Japanese Troops Annihilated; Japanese Supply Lines to Yichang Cut Off

Yichang: Since yesterday afternoon, the fighting around Yichang has intensified. A full-scale battle has also broken out south of Yuan'an, along the line from Dangyang to the southeastern area of Jingmen. As of noon on the 12th, the general situation of the fighting is as follows: (1) Japanese troops who crossed the river and invaded west of Yichang have reached the area north of Gulaobei (southeast of Yichang). Japanese troops invading from the south along the Hanyi Road have simultaneously advanced to the eastern side of Yaquelin (east of Yichang). Another group of Japanese troops invading west near Dangyang advanced to near Liangshuiying and Aijiadian, northeast of Yichang, yesterday afternoon and were fiercely repulsed by Chinese troops, suffering heavy casualties. Japanese reinforcements rushing in from Herong, Shilibu, Jiangling, and other places were strongly intercepted by a large Chinese force reserved to cut off the Japanese rearguard along the Banbi Mountain to Duankou line south of Dangyang, unable to join up with the remnants of the Japanese troops besieged around Yichang and are still fiercely fighting with the Chinese troops. (2) In Yuan'an, the Japanese fell into a deep trap on the night of the 10th. Yesterday afternoon, the Chinese troops launched an all-out assault, annihilating over 2,400 Japanese troops, and the river water turned crimson. Yuan'an County was also completely recaptured by the Chinese. (3) The Japanese troops near Jingmen and Dangyang are extremely exhausted. Last night, the Chinese troops launched a very swift operation to encircle the Japanese. Most of the Japanese troops in the outposts around the western city have been wiped out by the Chinese and are now being encircled and annihilated. (13th Dispatch)

Yichang: On the Hanyi Road, the Japanese troops have fallen into a heavy encirclement. The fighting in the area west of Dangyang is extremely fierce, and the morale of the Chinese troops is very high. A certain commander personally went to the front line to direct the battle and, with new tactics and a heroic posture, launched a fierce assault on the Japanese troops in front. The Japanese are on the verge of destruction, and the Chinese are tightening the encirclement and fiercely annihilating them. (13th Dispatch)

Chongqing: A semi-official organization here has denied Japanese reports that Yichang has fallen, stating that extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat is currently taking place in the two northeastern suburbs of Yichang. Chinese troops are fighting to the death under the three-pronged attack of the Japanese forces from the sea, land, and air, holding their ground and refusing to retreat. The Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. (Express News Agency, 13th)

Fancheng: The Japanese troops invading west on both the north and south sides of Dangyang have been surrounded by the Chinese troops due to the use of complex, narrow, winding terrain by the Chinese. In order to break the situation, the Japanese launched a dense artillery barrage at Baiyang on the 11th. At that time, the Chinese defending troops launched a fierce counterattack, wiping out over a thousand Japanese troops and driving the Japanese east of Baiyang. The Japanese rear has now been controlled by a large Chinese force. (12th Dispatch)

Chongqing: The Central News Agency has denied the rumors that Japanese troops captured Yichang on the night of June 11. It is reported that a reporter from the Central News Agency was still sending dispatches from Yichang yesterday afternoon, which can be confirmed by telegrams sent by American expatriates. However, Chinese military circles state that Yichang is not important because the Chinese are confident in their ability to eliminate the Japanese troops who forcibly crossed the Han River. It is reported that the Chinese troops are currently approaching Jingmen and Dangyang in an attempt to cut off the retreat of the Japanese troops in the Yichang area. (Reuters, 13th)

Fancheng: The Chinese troops have successfully mopped up the Japanese troops north of Dangyang in recent days. In 12 small strongholds, the Japanese left behind over a thousand bodies, over five hundred horses. The Chinese captured over 70 machine guns, over 400 rifles, over 80 mules, over 100 boxes of mountain gun shells and machine gun bullets, and countless other military supplies. (13th Dispatch)

Chongqing: Rumors are spreading that Yichang in western Hubei has fallen. The responsible authorities here have firmly denied this, saying that fierce fighting is taking place in the area. The number of troops mobilized by the Japanese in this battle is unprecedented. Large numbers of Chinese reinforcements arrived yesterday. (Havas, 13th)

Yichang: The fighting in the area on the east side of Yichang is still fierce. The Japanese claim to have captured Yichang at 5 pm on the 11th is completely false. It can be proven that the city is still in the hands of the Chinese troops as the reporter is still sending dispatches from here. The reporter visited a certain military officer this afternoon, who stated that regardless of the situation in Yichang, as long as the Japanese troops who have crossed the Xiang River have mostly entered the area near Yichang, the Chinese believe that they will be able to annihilate them all in accordance with the plan pre-determined by the Chinese High Command. (12th Dispatch)

Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesman speaking to foreign reporters today, as of now, the city of Yichang is still in the hands of the Chinese troops. Since yesterday, over 15,000 Japanese troops have advanced to the east of Yichang and are engaged in bloody fighting with the Chinese troops. The Chinese troops are still holding a stronghold on the Hanyi Road, 20 miles northeast of Yichang. The 15,000 Japanese troops attacking Yichang crossed the Shashi River on the 8th and invaded west. The Japanese troops invading Yichang from Jingmen and Dangyang have suffered heavy losses, so they risked advancing west along the Yangtze River from Shashi. The spokesman continued, stating that the Chinese have prepared to evacuate all materials from Yichang. Even if the city is lost, the Chinese will not suffer any major losses. The fall of Yichang is possible, but the city is still in the hands of the Chinese troops. Moreover, the Chinese still have a large force on the banks of the Xiang River east of Yichang, fighting the Japanese. The spokesman also stated that the Japanese have a total of 90,000 troops on the west bank of the Xiang River, but only 28 tanks. These tanks are amphibious. The Japanese air base on the west side of the Xiang River is in Zhongxiang, and it has been assisting the Japanese troops in the fighting on the west bank for days. (Express News Agency, 13th)

Hong Kong: It is reported that a unit of Japanese troops advancing on Yichang previously advanced to Liujiatang and other places, five miles from Yichang, and were discovered and annihilated by the Chinese troops. The communication line between this unit of Japanese troops and its main force in the rear had been cut off by the Chinese troops, so it was wiped out by the Chinese troops.

### Seven Japanese Aircraft that Attacked Chongqing the Other Day Shot Down by Chinese Troops; Japanese Aircraft Dropped Over 500 Bombs in Recent Days; Over 140 Civilian Casualties

Chongqing: On the 11th, Japanese aircraft adopted a tactic of advancing in batches, flying near the capital and carrying out bombing. One aircraft was shot down by the Chinese Air Force. At 12:00 noon on the 12th, over a hundred Japanese aircraft flew to the four suburbs of the capital and then broke into the city airspace. The brave Chinese Air Force, knowing their intentions, deployed and waited, immediately taking off to meet them in battle, shooting down one Japanese aircraft, which crashed in the northern suburbs of the city. Two Japanese aircraft were shot down over Zhongxian, and two were shot down over Wanxian, crashing into the Ruijiang. At the same time, another unit of Chinese armored birds repeatedly swept through the city airspace, shooting down two more remaining Japanese aircraft, one crashing in the western suburbs of Nanchuan and the other crashing in the southwestern suburbs of Fuling. Yang Anfan, a brave general of the Chinese Air Force, was slightly injured. All returned safely to their base. (12th Dispatch)

Chongqing: Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing again yesterday. According to Chinese sources, a total of seven Japanese aircraft were shot down. Mayor Wu Guozhen told reporters from the Havas News Agency that although Japanese aircraft dropped over 480 bombs in recent days, the number of civilian casualties was less than 200, indicating that the city's air defense facilities have been improved. Chinese officials are very satisfied that such a large-scale air raid resulted in so few deaths and that over 2,500 well-trained personnel completed the rescue work in a very short time. In short, although the Japanese aircraft have launched large-scale air raids and dropped many bombs in recent days, the results have been minimal compared to last year. Their intention is to intimidate the residents. The headquarters of the New Life Movement in Chongqing was hit by a bomb, but all personnel had already taken refuge in an air-raid shelter, and all office equipment and files had been moved to a safe location, so the damage was minimal. (Havas, 13th)

Chongqing: At noon on the 12th, Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing in four batches. The first batch flew to the left bank of the Jialing River at 12:15 pm and bombed the Jiangbei Highway. The other three batches flew to Yuzhong at 2:20 pm and bombed the Jialing River Wharf commercial center, the central district, and the western district from an altitude of 9,000 feet. Chinese fighter planes intercepted them and anti-aircraft artillery fired. It is reported that one Japanese aircraft was shot down in the eastern suburbs of Chongqing. Many houses were hit and caught fire during the bombing. A Havas reporter inspected the area and found that the residence of Catholic Bishop Johnson was badly damaged. He was still directing residents to carry out rescue work in the streets. Only the remaining walls of the church remained. Although the Presbyterian Hospital was destroyed, a large number of injured people were sent there for treatment. A Seventh-day Adventist church was completely destroyed. In addition, the Chongqing Hotel, where foreign journalists were staying, was also hit. As for the number of civilian casualties, it was small. Firefighters were clearing the streets. According to Chinese officials, the large-scale bombing of Chongqing while the Japanese are attacking Yichang is no different from the German tank forces' large-scale attack on the French army positions while bombing Paris at the same time. The Japanese intention is to end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible, so they are trying to use bombing to strike at the Chinese people's spirit of resistance. For this reason, Japanese aircraft will definitely come again to bomb. The authorities have now taken various measures to protect the people. (Havas, 12th)

Chongqing: Yesterday afternoon, Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing, causing over a hundred casualties. It is reported that the Japanese recently warned the embassies and legations of various countries here that the area where they are currently located is not very safe. However, no such warning was issued to the American Embassy. It is reported that the Japanese have informed the Americans that the area near the Mobil Oil Company docks, opposite the commercial airfield on the south bank of the Yangtze River, is not very safe. (Reuters, 13th)

Chongqing: Moscow News: The continuous attacks by Japanese aircraft have aroused the indignation of the Soviet people. People from all walks of life here are outraged after hearing the atrocities of the Japanese aggressors destroying Chinese cities on the radio. (12th Dispatch)

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Navy Ministry stated today that Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing, mainly targeting military targets. The Japanese will continue to bomb until the Chongqing government's resistance is destroyed. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Chongqing: Officials announced that 154 Japanese aircraft attacked yesterday and Chinese fighter planes shot down seven Japanese bombers. This was the most devastating attack that Chongqing has suffered. Japanese aircraft dropped over 500 bombs. Over 140 people were killed or injured and 300 houses were destroyed in various parts of the city. Japanese aircraft apparently intended to destroy Chongqing, so they bombed in shifts and in succession. Thousands of people fled the destroyed area, following the roads, the Jialing River, and the Yangtze River, but government offices continued to operate as usual. (Reuters, 13th)

Tokyo: Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy Ministry, recently warned the countries concerned that the volume of military supplies currently being transported to Chongqing from those routes is increasing daily. In the near future, the Yunnan Railway may be bombed again. The countries concerned should know that Japan will use more terrifying means to deal with the situation. The spokesman did not specify the nature of the military supplies, saying that the authorities must know what kind of situation is being transported. He also pointed out that the supplies transported from Indochina to Yunnan are sealed, while those transported from Burma are openly loaded. (United Press, 13th)

### Ministry of Personnel Restricts Employee Salaries

Chongqing: The Ministry of Personnel believes that the appointment of civil servants should be limited to positions with official ranks stipulated in the organizational regulations of various agencies, according to current laws and regulations. Recently, it has been found that many agencies report their salaries as employees under the names of clerks or staff members, ranging from dozens of dollars to hundreds of dollars or more, which is complex and varies widely. The resulting abuses will inevitably affect personnel administration. Therefore, the Ministry of Personnel has formulated measures to restrict employee names and salaries, stipulating that the names of employees hired by various agencies should be based on the organizational regulations of the agencies and that their salaries should be lower than those of appointed officials.

### French Prime Minister Reynaud Sends Emergency Appeal to U.S. President; French Troops Fighting in Dire Situation; Urgently Hoping for U.S. Assistance

Paris: French Prime Minister Reynaud telegraphed President Roosevelt, saying, “Your generous and benevolent decision to provide my country with aircraft, raw materials, and weapons is deeply appreciated. My country's divisions have been resisting the enemy's fierce superiority in manpower and material for six days and nights without an hour's rest. Now the enemy is approaching the gates of Paris. We are determined to fight before Paris, we are determined to fight after Paris, we will retreat to one of the provinces in the country, and if expelled from that province, we plan to go to North Africa, and if necessary, we plan to go to our American territories. Part of the government has now left Paris, and I am preparing to join the army, which is to strengthen the struggle with all the remaining forces, not to give up the struggle. Now I dare to ask your President to explain to your citizens our determination to sacrifice ourselves in the struggle for all free people. Now another dictator has struck France in the back, and naval warfare is about to begin. Your President has generously answered my call a few days ago, and today I dare to ask your President for even greater assistance. This is indeed my duty. Your President has publicly announced that the United States, apart from sending an expeditionary force, is willing to provide the Allied countries with material assistance in various ways. I earnestly urge the President to do so quickly, lest it be too late. I know the seriousness of this gesture, but it is precisely because of its seriousness that I must ask that the aid not come too late. I remember that your President once told us on October 5, 1937, that 90% of the world's peace, freedom, and security are now endangered by the remaining 10%, so the majority must find a way to establish a moral standard, which has been almost universally accepted by the world in every century. The time has come for 90% of the world's citizens to unite to resist the deadly danger that threatens everything. The life-and-death struggle that the Allied countries are now engaged in is not only for their own security but also for the security of your country's governance. I firmly believe that your people will sympathize with this.” (Reuters, 13th)

Paris: Authoritative sources recently stated that Roosevelt has responded to Prime Minister Reynaud's appeal. In his reply, the President inserted his previous remarks made in Chicago, stating that 90% of the world's people want peace and that the majority want to find ways to universally realize their will. (United Press, 13th)

### British Domestic Preparedness Plan: Report by the Home Secretary in the House of Commons

London - Yesterday in the House of Commons, during a debate, Home Secretary and Minister of National Security Anderson made a significant presentation on the large-scale preparedness plans being taken for domestic defense. He stated that the necessary equipment for civilian defense services had been fully distributed, including over 60 million respirators, including children's respirators and hemispherical caps for infants. In addition, 3 million steel helmets, 1.5 million oilskin garments, and a six-figure number of pumps had been issued. There were slightly less than one million shelters for civilian defense personnel. The fire brigade had been increased by 200,000 personnel, and the police force by 60,000. Personnel for health and casualty clearance services totaled over 250,000, and 100,000 personnel had been recruited for resident evacuation services and were ready for deployment at any time. The entire issue of civilian defense had undergone new changes due to the need to consider methods of defending against aerial bombing, land invasion, and paratrooper landings. Full cooperation had been achieved with civil authorities in all matters. He felt that the organization now established would make a valuable contribution to the collaborative efforts needed in the present situation. After Anderson concluded his statement, Lord Privy Seal Attlee suggested that the debate could continue in secret if the House so wished, but after many expressed their views, it was decided to continue the discussion in public.

### Air Combat Results of French and British Air Forces

London - A communiqué from the British Air Ministry stated that the Royal Air Force continued to repeatedly bomb enemy columns along the Seine River east of Rouen and in the Quinlan Forest area, carrying out low-level strafing, shooting down two enemy fighters. Four of our aircraft were missing. In one instance, our aircraft bombed for ten minutes, averaging over one hundred bombs dropped per minute. Our bombers also dropped bombs in formations at varying altitudes from 800 to 6,000 feet, destroying enemy transport columns, dispersing mechanized columns, and blocking road junctions. Forests were also set on fire. Our aircraft conducted night raids, bombing key points behind the battle zone, while other squadrons attacked military targets in Cologne and other cities in western Germany. When our heavy bombers were conducting reconnaissance over northern Italy, they attacked military targets in Turin. Other aircraft bombed Genoa. One of our heavy bombers was missing.

Our heavy bomber squadrons and light bomber squadrons have been disrupting enemy troop movements day and night behind enemy lines. Enemy transport columns and concentrations have been attacked by our aircraft. One of our heavy bomber squadrons encountered a large squadron of German fighters, and a battle immediately ensued, resulting in the downing of two German Messerschmitt aircraft and severely damaging another. In addition, one of our heavy bomber squadrons flew into German airspace and bombed German military targets, factories, and railways. Our reconnaissance aircraft continued to fly to the front lines day and night, with fighter escorts, and engaged in many battles with enemy aircraft. Although the enemy aircraft were numerous, our aircraft responded calmly and were very successful. The bravery and skill of our air force can once again be demonstrated by this." (Havas, 13th)

### US Senators Criticize President, Accusing Him of Pro-War Policies Instigated by Britain

Washington - Yesterday, criticisms of Roosevelt arose in the U.S. Senate, all claiming that the President was instigated by British propaganda to adopt a policy of aiding the Allied Powers. The aim of this propaganda was to drag the United States into the European war. Senator Wheeler, a Democrat from Montana, said that if "the Democratic Party becomes a pro-war party," he would leave the party and would not support Roosevelt's election for a third term. Senator Holt, a Democrat from West Virginia, said that Britain was spending millions of dollars in the United States with the intention of drawing the United States into the war on the side of the Allied Powers. Senators Wheeler and Holt both demanded a thorough investigation of the propaganda of the National Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and Britain. They also both denounced the giants of Wall Street, saying that their support for Roosevelt's pro-British and French policies was solely to protect their overseas interests. Senator Lundeen, a Farmer-Labor Party Senator from Minnesota, said, "Britain has spent $165,000,000 on propaganda to get the United States into the war." Lundeen also said that during the First World War, Britain spent $100 million on propaganda to get the United States to participate in the war. This criticism of Roosevelt by Congress is the most serious since the Supreme Court expansion plan was rejected. At the start of the debate, Senator Holt spoke first, criticizing the government for improperly selling American military supplies to manufacturers, who then resold them to the Allied Powers. Senator Wheeler declared, "I do not want to oppose the government, I do not want to break with Roosevelt, nor do I want to leave the Democratic Party, but if the Democratic Party becomes a pro-war party, then everything is over. I must leave the party, and I will not associate with the government. I certainly do not want to support a presidential candidate who would plunge the United States into war." Lundeen and Holt both accused the British government of improperly using money to influence the American press to gain pro-British propaganda. Holt said, "The certain newspapers controlled by certain banks that the president spoke of have recently been lavishing praise on the president, extolling his foreign policy, and those who seek to destroy America are also those certain newspapers. Now, if you examine the economic background of these newspapers, you will see that those who are engaged in journalism have economic interests that extend throughout the world. When their overseas investments are threatened, they want to send young American men overseas to protect their interests." (International News Service, 13th)

### Japanese Opposition Launches Campaign to Topple Cabinet: Kuhara Resigns from Advisory Post, Significant Changes Expected in Japan's International Status

Tokyo - Well-informed sources here today confidently stated that there will soon be important developments in Japan's international standing. Although these sources were unable to predict the nature of the future important developments, they indicated that the developments will be a critical juncture for the Yonai government's hopes of improving relations with the United States and for the minority of aggressive elements who demand that Japan join the German-Italian alliance. The growing sentiment in the United States that it is necessary to reach an understanding with Japan has given the Yonai government some hope. Japanese business leaders and government officials generally support the conclusion of a new commercial treaty with the United States at a suitable opportunity. Opposed to the Yonai policy are a minority who advocate Japan's participation in the European war in order to develop the "Southern Advance Policy," with the aim of increasing Japan's activities and interests in the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, and Vietnam. The Abe Cabinet collapsed because it failed to fulfill its promise to resolve the war with China. If the Yonai Cabinet cannot resolve the war with China immediately, it will meet the same fate. The opposition is attacking the Yonai Cabinet for accomplishing nothing and has used various opportunities to launch a campaign to topple the cabinet. Yonai advocates close cooperation with the United States, Great Britain, and France in order to gain the sympathy of all parties. Since the fate of his cabinet depends entirely on whether he can make the international situation favorable to Japan, Yonai will implement his policies according to his own intentions. Last spring, when he was Navy Minister in the Hiranuma Cabinet, General Yonai blocked the attempt by army factions to promote a military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Those who opposed Yonai's proposal at the time are now carrying out a campaign to topple the cabinet. Kuhara's resignation from his post as cabinet advisor has made the opposition to the Yonai Cabinet a public fact. Before submitting his resignation, Kuhara suggested to Yonai that the cabinet resign en masse. Yonai rejected his suggestion, so Kuhara submitted his resignation and publicly attacked Yonai's "kneeling policy," because Kuhara wants Yonai to end his "flattering" attitude towards the United States and Great Britain and wants Japan to declare war on China and invoke the rights of a belligerent state to drive foreigners out of the Far East. This policy is the same as that advocated last summer by Mitsuru Toyama, head of the nationalist Black Dragon Society. Kuhara also advocates merging all political parties into a single national party to cooperate with the military and engage in aggressive actions in order to guarantee Japan's dominance in the Far East. It is rumored that Prince Konoe is also considering resigning as President of the House of Peers to become the leader of a new party, but he does not fully endorse Kuhara's policies and openly opposes the idea of making the new party merely a rubber stamp for the military. Konoe does not want to embarrass Yonai. If Yonai can bring about a diplomatic change that pleases the Japanese people, then he seems likely to remain in office, and Konoe can become the leader of a national political party, providing an outlet for extremists so that they do not necessarily have to implement their ideas. In 1937 and 1938, Nobumasa Suetsugu, the Minister of Home Affairs in the Konoe Cabinet, also advocated organizing a single political party. His advocacy while Minister of Home Affairs contributed to the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet. Another opponent of the Yonai Cabinet is Toshio Shiratori, the former Italian ambassador. The rift between the Yonai Cabinet and advocates of a single political party was made public in front of the Nishikyo Shrine during the Emperor's visit. The Emperor's actions temporarily delayed political affairs. Puyi will visit Japan from June 26 to July 2, at which time the Japanese political situation will certainly be calm. However, observers here believe that political unrest will occur after Puyi leaves Japan. (United Press, 13th)

### Policy of Maintaining the Status Quo of the Dutch East Indies Remains Unchanged: Dutch Government in London Denies Request for British Protection

London - The German News Agency today broadcast via a Dutch radio station that a report from Tokyo stated that the authorities in the Dutch East Indies had requested protection from Great Britain and that 2,000 British troops had landed in eastern Java. The Dutch government in London therefore issued a declaration stating that this claim was purely fabricated and had no basis in fact. There are no British troops in Java or any other part of the Netherlands. The Dutch authorities will never change their established policy of maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters, 13th)

Tokyo - Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy Ministry, said that he had not received any confirmed reports regarding the Japanese newspapers' reports that a Japanese fishing boat had been fired upon by a Dutch patrol boat in the waters of the Dutch East Indies or that 2,000 British soldiers had landed in the Dutch East Indies. He continued, saying that if these reports were true, the Japanese government could not ignore them. In the past, there have been several incidents of Japanese fishing boats being fired upon by Dutch patrol boats. In the current situation, the continued occurrence of such incidents may have significant implications. (United Press, 13th)

### Former Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura to Visit Dutch East Indies and the Philippines

Tokyo - The newspaper "Miyako Shimbun" recently reported that former Foreign Minister Kichisaburo Nomura will depart from Yokohama on July 10 for the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines to discuss Pacific issues with the governments there. According to the newspaper, Nomura's visit is due to the general suspicion that Japan harbors ambitions towards the southeastern Pacific, and even repeated statements of assurance from Japan have not been able to dispel general concerns. The newspaper also stated that Nomura will discuss immigration restrictions to the Philippines with the Philippine government. (United Press, 13th)

### Anglo-Japanese Agreement Reached on Tianjin Concession Issues: Allocation of Some Silver for Drought Relief, Approval of Circulation of Puppet Currency in the Concession

London - With the understanding of the Chongqing government obtained by the British side, an Anglo-Japanese agreement was reached here yesterday that will lead to the immediate lifting of the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. According to the British side, although the British side has accepted guarantees of certain interests, there are concrete measures to protect the interests of the Chongqing government. The agreement consists of four articles: (1) Of the 85,000 pounds sterling belonging to Chongqing stored in the Tianjin Concession, 10,000 pounds sterling will be used for drought and flood relief in North China. This money will be distributed by a committee composed of Chinese, British, and Japanese representatives. The remaining 75,000 pounds sterling will be placed in the Bank of Communications in Tianjin and sealed off by the British and Japanese sides, but this will not be detrimental to the account holders. (2) It is expected that Japan will immediately lift the blockade of the British Concession (which has been in place for thirteen months). (3) Japanese police can "cooperate" with British authorities within the British Concession to suppress terrorists. (4) British authorities will remove obstacles regarding the currency system and allow "Federal Reserve" banknotes to circulate within the concession. (United Press, 12th)

London - Reuters has learned from here that the details of the Anglo-Japanese agreement on various issues in the Tianjin British Concession will be released in a few days after the agreement is formally signed. (Reuters, 10th)

Tokyo - Suma, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, said yesterday that the British and Japanese sides had reached a compromise on the issue of the Tianjin British Concession. The matters agreed upon were police affairs, silver, and currency issues, but he did not mention the issue of Chinese silver in the French Concession in Tianjin. It is clear that this matter will require more time to resolve. (Reuters, 13th)

### In Memory of Zhang Zizhong, a Model Chinese Soldier Who Bravely Sacrificed Himself for His Country

It was a rainy dusk, the clock pointing to half-past four. The rain grew heavier, the sky darker, and I couldn't help but feel that this ominous weather was a bad omen!

The unfortunate news came as expected. We received a telegram reporting that Commander-in-Chief Zhang Zizhong had bravely sacrificed himself for his country on May 16, after leading his troops to break through the Japanese lines and causing the entire Japanese army to collapse. This heartbreaking news was unbelievable to all of us. I remember how, just a few months ago, I had the honor of meeting him somewhere in northern Hubei. General Zhang's amiable sincerity and humble manner felt like just yesterday. Now, this unfortunate news tells us that we will never see this respectable general again. This is a tremendous loss for the nation and an irreparable loss for our people. Therefore, I hope this news is a false report. However, more telegrams arrived, and the news became more and more confirmed. On the 17th, we received a telegram containing detailed information about the events leading up to General Zhang's heroic sacrifice, which moved us to tears. As I, the reporter, begin to write this tribute to General Zhang's life, my heart trembles, and I don't know where to start. Let me begin with a brief biography:

General Zhang Zizhong, also known as Gaichen, was originally from Shandong. This Shandong man truly embodies the spirit of a Shandong hero, being loyal and generous. Although he came from a military background, he was exceptionally kind to others, earning the respect and love of everyone he met. Before the Lugou Bridge Incident, he was affiliated with the 29th Army, under the command of Song Zheyuan. During the July 7th Incident, he was trapped in Peiping (Beijing). At that time, General Zhang was unanimously condemned throughout the country, with many questioning his intentions. Later, his will remained firm and unwavering. He risked great danger, managed to leave Peiping, and fled to Nanjing to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Chiang then sent him to the Fifth War Area to fight. During the Battle of Bengbu, General Zhang made significant contributions.

There is another well-known anecdote, which many people may know. It is about when General Zhang met with Commander Li before the fall of Xuzhou. General Li told him, "If a commander in the South leaves his troops, the troops will fall into chaos. But the troops in the North are different; even if the commander leaves, there won't be chaos!" He felt very ashamed after hearing this. Although he didn't say anything at the time, he later told General Li's aides, "General Li's words are true, but I hope he will give me direct orders and not be too lenient with me, which makes me uneasy." From then on, under the command of Commander Li, General Zhang became even more courageous and advanced even more vigorously. His loyal and brave spirit and magnificent and heroic physique not only dealt a heavy blow to the Japanese aggressors, but also earned the deep respect of Commander Li. Since the start of the war, General Zhang made many contributions during the first major victory at the Battle of Taierzhuang. Later, during the Battle of Xuzhou, he made extraordinary achievements. General Li loved him even more and would mention General Zhang's bravery and skillful fighting to anyone he met. During the Battle of Xuzhou, Guangxi suffered many casualties. The central leadership made great efforts to replenish the troops. At that time, General Li only received a very small number of machine guns and bullets. However, under the principle of rewarding merit, General Li sent all of them to the troops led by General Zhang Zizhong. This made General Zhang extremely grateful and excited!

What happened next? The victorious battle of the first campaign in northern Hubei can tell us. General Zhang can be said to be the foremost contributor. When the Japanese tightly surrounded our hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the brave and skilled General Zhang again launched a central assault. In the first major victory in northern Hubei, the biggest blow to the Japanese on the right wing was inflicted by General Zhang Zizhong's command.

The victorious news of the second campaigns in northern Hubei and southern Henan arrived. As the Japanese and our forces were engaged in fierce fighting on the battlefields of Henan and Hubei, our heroic General Zhang Zizhong bravely sacrificed himself for his country on May 16. According to confirmation from various sources, General Zhang's death was truly heroic. He was not killed by Japanese artillery fire. Although he was wounded by Japanese bullets, he ultimately took his own life. Precisely because he had been severely wounded, he refused to retreat. He wanted revenge, not just for himself, but also for the countless martyrs. Therefore, he still wanted to charge forward, but his injuries worsened. He still refused to retreat, and he even more refused to die by Japanese guns. So, he gloriously sacrificed himself and took his own life. This story is so shocking and fresh! So tragic and heroic!

At the time of his death, he told his guards, "You must leave quickly. I have my own way. My conscience is clear to the country, the nation, and the leaders. Everyone must kill the Japanese and avenge me!" How loyal his words are! May every compatriot be vigilant! These were his last words to his guards, and they were also his last words to all 450 million of our compatriots.

### Analysis of Italy's Participation in the Second European War (Conclusion)

After the outbreak of the Second European War, the Italian government took advantage of its geographical position to seek commercial benefits from the belligerent countries. Some Italians even hoped that their country could remain neutral and become the most important industrial and commercial nation in Europe.

Compared to Germany, Britain, France, and Belgium could supply Italy with various raw materials and purchase Italian products with cash. Britain also wanted to ease Mussolini's stance by increasing trade with Italy. In late January, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace released reliable information stating that the value of Italian machinery imported into Britain and France, and the value of raw materials from Britain and France imported into Italy, totaled 250,000,000 US dollars in the five months after the war began. The total amount of ships, machinery, automobiles, and motors purchased by Britain reached 4,000,000,000 lire, while France reached 3,500,000,000 francs. Britain and France also allowed Italy to import essential raw materials and coal through the blockade lines.

However, this favorable situation also had its disadvantages. The British and French blockades, with control stations in Gibraltar, Haifa, and Aden, became major obstacles to Italian trade and prevented Italy from advancing into new markets. This hindered Italy from collecting large quantities of important raw materials for re-export to Germany or for its own use.

In mid-February, Anglo-Italian commercial negotiations failed, and anti-British editorials began to appear in Italian newspapers, effectively bringing commercial relations between the two countries to a standstill. The main reason for the dispute was that Italy was unwilling to exchange machinery and other heavy industrial products for important metals and coal.

The crisis reached its peak in early March when the British Contraband Control Office prohibited fifteen Italian ships, fully loaded with German coal from Rotterdam, Netherlands, from sailing to Italy. Many observers believed that Britain's detention of Italian coal ships was an attempt to force Italy to fulfill its arms orders. Britain was in a very advantageous position because Italy usually had to import 12,000,000 tons of coal, and at least three-quarters of it was imported by sea from Germany.

Overall, Italy did not economically gain as much benefit as it had hoped. The British and French blockade proved increasingly difficult for it to endure. Although the official exchange rate of the lira was only allowed to fall very slightly, in reality, many lire were used for special purposes, and many were simply devalued significantly, worth 1.68 US cents. It is said that this Italian plan was to compete with Britain and France in the export market.

Italy has already limited the distribution of certain Italian goods, such as coffee, sugar, soap, and coal, and if the war continues, it will inevitably do the same for other goods. Therefore, Italy has been economically at war for many years. This fact is nowhere more clearly expressed than in its financial situation. For example, on January 29, the cabinet approved the budget for 1940-1941, which was short by 6 billion lire. By 1941, the total deficit of the past six years' budgets would reach 55 billion lire, the national debt would exceed 290 billion, and the amount used for war purposes since March would reach 147 billion. The five-year wars in Abyssinia and Spain, the economically irrational pursuit of self-sufficiency, the massive public works projects, and the constant military buildup have placed a very heavy burden on Italy, leaving little in reserve.

Mussolini originally hoped to fulfill his ambitions without actually participating in the war, at the expense of human and material resources, because these two things were not permissible for the Italian army and economy and would be enough to damage his regime. He originally hoped to emerge in a position of great importance, making demands when both sides of the conflict were exhausted. When this opportunity will arrive, only Mussolini will make the final decision. (Excerpted and translated from the U.S. Foreign Policy Report)

### Wuxi Buddhists Advocate Building a Pagoda

Wuxi Correspondence: Local devout Buddhists, recently observing the inequality between people and the prevalence of evil in society, and guided by the Buddhist principles of equality and compassion, have organized a pagoda construction society to promote the construction of a pagoda. The pagoda construction society was established here on May 30. Its stated purpose is to advance from Buddhist equality to human equality, and from suppressing evil through pagoda construction to establishing guarantees for personal equality, prioritizing spiritual construction before material construction. The proposed pagoda sites include West Lake, Beiping, Xikang, Tibet, Qinghai, Inner and Outer Mongolia. The estimated construction cost is 50 million yuan, to be raised by influential Buddhist believers in the financial sector, with expert designs and construction, making the project grand. The proponent is 80-year-old Qian Youqin, and the supporter is 90-year-old Chen Jianqi. After the Chinese army withdrew from Wuxi, Qian was severely injured by Japanese soldiers with five knife wounds and one gunshot wound, but survived, which he believes is due to the power of Buddhism. Qian claims to be a descendant of Qian Wusu Wang and always says that he is worthy of his ancestors. During the late Qing Dynasty, he was highly trusted by Zhao Tai. After the establishment of the Republic of China, Qian supported the provisional president and actively persuaded officials to switch sides. He associated widely with Li Jiabai. He is a devout Buddhist, refuses to be a slave, and does not participate in deceptive or fraudulent policies, advocating the construction of genuine peace in the world, truly a complete person. Chen is a person highly valued by the Panchen Lama and a well-known leader in Buddhism. He promoted the construction of a bronze statue of the Panchen Lama, which was widely recognized at the time. Other sympathizers and supporters who serve as cadres include Zhou Zhide, Zhu Mouxian, Sun Xiangzhong, and Huang Jingwan, who are also deeply knowledgeable in Buddhist studies. Huang's extensive connections in various circles mean that he is responsible for the association's liaison work.

### Mianfu Cup Charity Mini-Soccer; Order Increased for Performance; Changes in the Lineups of the Chinese and Western Teams

The annual Mianfu Cup Chinese-Western Charity Mini-Soccer Tournament will be held from now on. The first match between the Chinese team and the Western team is scheduled to take place tomorrow afternoon at the Aurora College field. To make the ceremony grand, Mr. Yuan Ludeng has been specially invited to kick off the game, and Ms. Chen Yunshang, a movie star, will present the awards. According to the announcement from the Aurora College authorities, two additional intermission performances will be added before this exciting charity match. In addition to the match between the Samsung team and the Portuguese team, a match between the Aurora College Junior High School and the Xu Hui Middle School will be added starting at 3:00 p.m. This match is the final of the Aurora Cup inter-school championship. Although the performance is not as exciting as the final main event between the Chinese and Western teams, it is also worth watching. As for the lineups of the Chinese and Western teams, they have been revised once yesterday and are slightly different from those previously disclosed. On the Chinese side, Qin Bi, who has excellent goalkeeping skills, has suffered a slight injury, so Zheng Tongyu will be used for the goalkeeper position. Defender Feng Shoupeng is a pillar of the Samsung team and must fight the Portuguese merchants at that time, so it is difficult for him to be present. Cai Shengsen suffered a serious eye injury when attending the international Chinese-English final last week, with a laceration as wide as two centimeters. The injury has not yet healed. On the Western side, due to his job, Qu Lihua will be replaced by Maurice of East Tele for the goalkeeper position.

Aurora College vs. Xu Hui (Inter-School Final): 3:00 p.m.

### Fluctuations in Financial Values: Rumors of U.S. Dollar Devaluation Cause Uncertainty

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC posting rates at 9:30 AM. British exchange rates remained unchanged, while U.S. exchange rates tightened by 0.125. Other exchange rates, such as Japanese Yen, fluctuated. The internal market situation appeared unusual. Initially, heavy settlement demands from importers (reportedly reaching $500,000 USD throughout the day) led Chinese banks and merchants to actively settle. The July forward U.S. dollar market trended weaker, with the tightest spot Sterling at 3 pence 8.125, and U.S. dollars at only 5 yuan 8.4375. After 10:30 AM, a sudden reversal occurred, with Sassoon, China Bank, and Yokohama Specie Bank selling. At noon, news arrived of a sale of Sterling from Hong Kong Electric and rumors of the fall of Paris and devaluation of the U.S. dollar, maintaining the pound at 4 yuan 0.02. Discussions of a sharp increase in exchange rates arose, causing a sharper decline in the U.S. dollar compared to Sterling. The U.S. dollar returned to over 6 yuan, peaking at 6 yuan 0.1875, while Sterling rebounded to 2 pence 0.875. In the afternoon, importers continued to strongly buy, briefly causing another tight market, but due to the re-emergence of sellers, a hardening trend was seen. The closing prices were 3 pence 8.4375 for Sterling and 6 yuan 0.15625 for U.S. dollars, with Sterling tightening by 0.125 and U.S. dollars reversing, increasing by 0.09375. Trading was extremely active throughout the day.

Sassoon's Sudden Sell-Off

Early morning trading saw London rates rising by half a penny for both near and far dates. The New York silver price remained unchanged, and London gold prices were stable. British exchange rates against the U.S. dollar remained unchanged, while against Shanghai they decreased by 0.125. Against France, there was no change. The U.S. dollar fell by five points against the pound and slightly against Shanghai by four points. Against France, it decreased by one point. The Central Bank's posted rates for various currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 pence 9.6875 for Sterling and 6 yuan 0.0625 for the U.S. dollar, the same as the previous night's close for both currencies. Chinese banks initially bought, and foreign firms also came to settle accounts. American banks were still willing to supply, resulting in a slight easing. It was estimated that American banks supplied Chinese banks and foreign firms with July U.S. dollars at 5 yuan 0.875 and 0.8125. Subsequently, Chinese speculators followed, buying July U.S. dollars, further tightening the price, and absorbing American bank holdings at 5 yuan 0.71875. Spot Sterling reached 3 pence 0.84375. When HSBC posted its rates, Sterling remained unchanged, and the U.S. dollar tightened by 0.125. The silver equalization tax increased by 2.75 percent. Afterwards, Sassoon suddenly sold, causing the market to shift from stable to hardening. It was estimated that foreign firms took Sassoon's June U.S. dollars at 5 yuan 0.9375 to 6 yuan. Yokohama Specie Bank also entered the market to sell, while speculative buyers paused, resulting in ample supply and a weakening price. Yokohama Specie Bank sold June U.S. dollars to foreign firms at 6 yuan 0.125. Around noon, the East Asia Bank and Shanghai Overseas Chinese Bank jointly sold spot U.S. dollars to foreign firms at 6 yuan and 0.15625, but the closing trend showed renewed hardening. Rumors of U.S. dollar devaluation and the fall of Paris emerged, causing the U.S. dollar to weaken further. Ultimately, Sterling closed at 3 pence 0.875 and the U.S. dollar at 6 yuan 0.1875, with Sterling weaker by 0.09375 and the U.S. dollar stronger by 0.125 compared to the morning opening.

Heavy Foreign Firm Settlement

In the afternoon, foreign firms continued to settle heavily. Although Jardine Matheson and Chartered Bank were willing to supply, prices had already weakened. It was estimated that foreign firms bought June U.S. dollars at 6 yuan 0.0625 and 0.03125. Later, due to strong selling pressure, they sold June U.S. dollars at 6 yuan 0.09375, gradually easing the situation. There were few changes before closing, with Sterling closing at 3 pence 0.84375 and the U.S. dollar at 6 yuan 0.15625. Central Bank dollars and spot dollars were at the same price this month, with the U.S. dollar at 6 yuan 0.125. Next month, Sterling was at 3 pence 0.75, and the U.S. dollar at 5 yuan 0.9375. Compared to yesterday's close, spot Sterling tightened by 0.125, while the U.S. dollar hardened by 0.09375. Next month's Sterling decreased by 0.125, while the U.S. dollar remained stable.

Tightening in Tianjin Exchange Market

Tianjin, July 13th (Thursday). The exchange market opened weaker this morning. Spot Sterling tightened by 0.125 to 3 pence 0.375. Spot U.S. dollars decreased by 0.3125 to 5 yuan 0.1875. Shanghai exchange decreased by 0.50 to 114 yuan. Joint Reserve Notes in the black market decreased by 1.50 to 99 yuan 0.75.

### Sudden Fluctuations in Foreign Currency

Yesterday’s foreign currency market at the 烚赤 exchange opened high. Demand for both U.S. and British banknotes was high. However, they soon followed the price of gold and declined, ultimately dropping by two yuan each. British banknotes rose due to market rumors of a fixed official exchange rate for the pound. U.S. banknotes initially rose to 16 yuan 0.95, but then rumors of German troops advancing on Paris resurfaced, along with further speculation of a higher pound exchange rate. This led to a significant weakening of the black market U.S. dollar, with an abundant supply of U.S. banknotes. By midday, the price had fallen to 15 yuan 0.95. Although it rose to 16 yuan 0.20 in the afternoon, it ultimately fell back to 16 yuan, a decrease of 0.50 compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong and Canadian banknotes was strong, and market prices rose consistently. Philippine banknotes, however, trended weaker. Japanese banknotes fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, closing at 1 yuan 0.09. The supply and demand for Korean banknotes were balanced, and market prices remained stable, closing at 0 yuan 0.935.

### Exchange Rate Fluctuations, Chaotic Gold Market, Daily Fluctuation of 380 Yuan

Yesterday's cash market (烚赤) in the black market experienced frequent fluctuations and chaotic trends, due to the sudden tightening and loosening of the exchange market, leading to uncertainty. Most of the trading was speculative. The market opened strongly at 170 yuan, reaching 5,550 yuan. Although there was a slight dip of several dozen yuan, it soon reached a high of 5,600 yuan. Securities firms, gold shops, and money changers were all actively buying. However, at midday, due to the easing of the exchange market and widespread rumors of the fall of Paris, U.S. dollar devaluation, and the U.S. government's intention to maintain the pound at 4 yuan, a wave of selling was triggered, with the price dropping to 5,280 yuan. The closing price was only 5,290 yuan. The market remained weak in the early afternoon, but with the weakening of foreign exchange rates, gold shops and money changers aggressively entered the market, pushing the price up to 5,420 yuan. Ultimately, with strong selling from securities firms, the market closed at 5,325 yuan, a decrease of 55 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading volume remained substantial, around 4,000 taels. Jewelry shops were asking a small premium of ten yuan for gold, while customs gold remained unchanged.

烚赤 Drops 55 Yuan

From the morning on, the price (per ten taels) initially fell due to the weakening exchange rate and the tightening of the U.S. dollar. The market opened with strong sentiment, jumping 170 yuan. Money changers and silver firms jointly bought 30 taels, reaching 5,550 yuan. Subsequently, selling from gold shops and individual investors caused a slight dip of 30 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to silver firms at 5,520 yuan. Securities firms and silver firms then engaged in dragging, soon pushing the price up by another 80 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold shops at 5,600 yuan. Afterwards, certain firms took advantage of the high price to sell, and silver firms also shifted from buying to selling. With a decrease in buyers due to the easing of foreign exchange rates, the price soon fell by 160 yuan. Gold shops sold 30 taels to money changers at 5,440 yuan. Subsequently, with support from jewelry shops and gold shops, the price rose again by 100 yuan. Gold shops bought 20 taels from silver firms at 5,540 yuan. Unexpectedly, the number of buyers gradually decreased, and with the continued easing of foreign exchange rates, many sellers saw an opportunity and sold, causing the price to fall again. When the price fell to within the 5,500 yuan range, sellers increased even more. Rumors of U.S. dollar devaluation and the fall of Paris spread. A certain silver firm, with a large long position, began selling off its holdings, amounting to 1,000 taels. By closing, the price had fallen below the 5,300 yuan mark. Silver firms sold 30 taels to securities firms at 5,280 yuan, followed by securities firms buying 10 taels from silver firms at 5,290 yuan, marking the midday closing price. After the closing, silver firms continued to sell, doing small trades down to 5,260 yuan. The market was even weaker when it reopened in the afternoon. Silver firms sold 30 taels to money changers at 5,220 yuan. Subsequently, due to tightening foreign exchange rates, a certain money changer repeatedly and aggressively bought, and silver firms and securities firms followed suit. Although another money changer was still willing to supply, inventory was insufficient, causing the price to rise by 200 yuan. Gold shops bought 20 taels from silver firms, then 5,420 yuan. After this, the exchange market eased, and rumors spread that the U.S.-British exchange rate would increase to 4 yuan. Many individual long positions began selling, and money changers, securities firms, and silver firms sold in succession, causing a decline of 95 yuan. Gold shops sold 10 taels to silver firms at 5,325 yuan, marking the closing price for the evening. As a result, the price fell by 55 yuan compared to the previous day, with a daily fluctuation of 380 yuan. Cash gold shops sold their brand gold at a price that was several dozen yuan higher than 烚赤, and bought it back at a price that was 30 yuan lower. Current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than listed gold, with few transactions.

Jewelry Shops Post a Small Premium of Ten Yuan

The initial selling price of jewelry gold was 560 yuan per tael at Ta Tung Heng. By 9:30, the price was posted at a premium of ten yuan, then back to a small premium of ten yuan at 10:00. At 10:30, it was again posted at a premium of ten yuan, then back to a small premium of ten yuan at 11:30, and again at 11:50. The price was lowered by ten yuan at 12:00, and posted at a premium of ten yuan at 2:30, ultimately closing at a small premium of ten yuan. Ta Tung Heng suspended its price at 550 yuan. Xin Tung Heng had the same price as the former, buying back gold at a price that was about 30 yuan lower.

### Securities: Little Fluctuation in Domestic Bonds

The securities black market was chaotic yesterday, with only small differences in prices. The market was small, but most of the speculators in gold and foreign exchange remained, unwilling to leave. The foreign stock market was nearing its end, with little hope of recovery. Activity and prosperity in the public bond market must await the gradual return of the prices of various goods to normal before re-engaging. Yesterday passed relatively smoothly despite numerous rumors. The market opened lower in the morning and rose slightly in the afternoon. Buyers and sellers were inconsistent, with most transactions being speculative. Few capitalists participated, making it difficult to cause major changes. However, those with long positions were unsuitable for the current environment and bore large interest burdens, making it even more difficult for the market to rise. The overall result was a difference of 0.125 to 0.15, with a total transaction volume of over 700,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

Stock Transactions: Fifty shares of Ning Shao Shipping Company were traded at a price of 13 yuan 0.50.

The Zhongye stock market was stimulated by the surge in New York. Although many doubted whether the local surge would last, U.S. government spending on defense was considerable, undoubtedly providing a strong stimulant to American industry and commerce. The environment in Shanghai was different, and market activity was less vibrant. Prices were slightly higher than the previous closing. The intraday fluctuations were small, with the opening and closing prices being similar. Jardine stocks were a slight exception, opening at 31 yuan 0.25, rising to 32 yuan, and closing at 30 yuan 0.50. Rubber stocks had stronger demand. The market price of London Chinese foreign debt stocks remained unchanged.

### Coal: Significant Discrepancies in White Coal Prices

The price of white coal has seen cost reductions due to continuous weakening in foreign exchange rates. Though merchants cite rising freight costs to defend prices, market sentiment is volatile and points downward. Significant discrepancies exist between advertised and actual transaction prices, exceeding ten yuan. Hongji white coal is advertised at 216 yuan, but transactions at old warehouses are done at 205-206 yuan. Tongdeli white coal is selling at 200 yuan per ton. However, retail stores on the street have yet to change their prices.

### Grains: Many Continuing Orders for Foreign Rice, Food Supply Not Threatened by Drought, Speculation in Japonica Rice Intensifies

Yesterday morning's rice market saw both buyers and sellers expecting higher prices. With the continuation of earlier foreign exchange rates, holders of foreign rice were even more unwilling to sell, waiting for opportunities. Buyers, seeing a tight market, decided to take decisive action to acquire available supply. Thereupon, the market followed, with all vying for supply, whether retail or floating. At this point, the price of all kinds of foreign rice was raised by more than one yuan amidst confused shouts. Number 1 old West Saigon rice opened at 56.5 yuan and 56 yuan. Number 2 at 54.5 yuan. Number 1 Siamese special rice from 56.5 yuan to 56 yuan. Number 2 at 54.5 yuan, 54 yuan. Fire milled rice at 55.5 yuan, 55 yuan. Small milled rice at 53.5 yuan. Tokyo rice points at 53.5 yuan, then to 52.8 yuan. Rice Tea Xing mixed broken rice has been stable due to the considerable arrival of new goods and limited sales channels. In the afternoon, with the easing of foreign exchange rates, new orders for foreign rice, apart from three or four batches of Saigon rice that have not yet been confirmed, included 1,000 tons of West Saigon rice from the Da Fu Foreign Company at a price of 60 yuan 0.10 and 3,000 tons from Jian Yuan Company at a price of 59.5 yuan, both to be shipped at the end of June or early July. 1,000 tons of Number 2 Siamese rice have not yet been formally agreed upon. Under the current foreign exchange rates, Vietnamese, Siamese, and Burmese rice can all be transported. The rice market's future will not face unexpected panic due to drought. There were also shouts for 60 yuan 0.50 for returned Siamese Number 1 rice, while Saigon Number 2 rice was traded at 58.5 yuan and 58 yuan per ton.

Only a little over 1,000 bags of thick and thin Japonica and other domestic rice arrived. According to rumors in the informal market, most owners of interior rice took a bullish view, citing expensive inland coarse prices, heavy body weights, and weak market supply. Counter to this, those catering to customers were responding to rising retail demand and therefore were unwilling to back down because of high prices. Therefore, owners grew even more bullish, wildly opening prices for Changbang Special Clear Japonica at 64 yuan, Kunsu and Changzhou Japonica at 62-63 yuan, then to 60 yuan, Thin Rice Fresh Special at 62 yuan, market 61 yuan, South Harbour Early Rice at 60 yuan, up another 1-2 yuan, etc.

Only three or four carts of glutinous rice arrived yesterday, and because the price was the lowest, and has distanced itself significantly from Japonica rice informal, led to big traders hoarding, prices also rose by one yuan, Jinli special yuan had opened 50 yuan to 49 yuan, Changdan white yuan 47-48 yuan, Jiangbei white yuan around 46 yuan.

### New Wheat from Juhu Enters the Market, Flour Remains Mediocre

Flour: The flour market trended steadily yesterday. Transactions with local customers were relatively lively. Besides daily needs, customers in Quanzhou and other places in the Southern Seas continued to make contact. However, because it is difficult for mills to buy raw materials, they were still unwilling to fully supply, so the market continued to lack heat. The total transactions were about 6,000-7,000 bags. The base price for Number 2 flour mills maintained at 13.8 yuan, while customer prices were 16.2 yuan to 16 yuan, a difference of more than two yuan. The market can currently be said to be stable. If the supply of new wheat is unimpeded, the flour market may return to lower levels.

Wheat: Since the new wheat season began in various places, it has been a long time. However, the Shanghai market has yet to officially open because Chinese merchants have been unable to transport the goods. The previous day, rumors circulated that Kunshan wheat had arrived in Shanghai for the first time. Yesterday, the wheat collection stations of both the Fuxin and Fufeng mills confirmed that it was Jiading new wheat, only about 100 bags, and it did not arrive in Shanghai publicly. Yesterday, new Wuhu wheat officially entered the market, accounting for 1,400 bags purchased by the Fuxin and Fufeng mills, at a price of 23.5 to 23.8 yuan. The quality of the goods was excellent and the moisture content was dry, so the selling price was about 0.5 yuan higher.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Highly Speculative

The yarn market trended unstable, mainly because of the efforts of speculators. Therefore, it suddenly rose and fell, making it hard to predict. However, sales were only in the South China area. Although there were no wholesale transactions, retail purchases continued. Japanese yarn prices are still low, so Chinese yarn has been greatly suppressed.

The market for spot yarn opened up in the morning, with prices continuing to rise. Because the foreign exchange rates frequently decreased early in the morning, speculative merchants were active again. The opening price of Double Horse 20 count was 1,135 yuan, once rising to 1,160 yuan. Then, due to continuous profit-taking by large sellers, gold prices decreased, and foreign exchange rates eased, market sentiment weakened, falling to 1,127 yuan at the close. However, after the close, prices fell an additional 20 yuan. The transaction volume for half a day was estimated to be 1,945 bales. The market price of Double Horse 20 count was 50 yuan higher than the closing price. Today, 1,602 yarn pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each port of call is listed below:

Domestic 1,315, Hong Kong 440, Ningbo 140, Xiamen 50, Total 1,945

### U.S. Cotton Prices Soar, Rumors Circulate that Indian Cotton Has Been Seized En Route

Trading in local cotton has completely stopped. There were slight transactions in Indian cotton. Mill purchases were minimal. Transactions among merchants were also rare. This is because the yarn market is depressed, the European situation is serious, and the recent surge in the supply of Indian and U.S. cotton has put pressure on market sentiment. The transaction status of current cotton is listed below:

Hui Shi Deng 120.00 Qing Tai Advance 100 bales

Xin Te 165.00 Rong Feng Advance 100 bales

Xin Te 169.00 Shanghai Advance 100 bales

Aum La 177.00 Qing He Advance 100 bales

According to outside sources, the New York cotton market opened this morning and rose due to purchases by speculators. The strong stock market on Wall Street, increased domestic mill demand, and short covering led to an unusually strong market close, rising by over 20 points compared to the previous day. The predicted price for Indian cotton increased by three rupees yesterday.

Due to rumors that an Italian cargo ship carrying over 10,000 pieces of Indian cotton was seized near Singapore, the increased difficulty of shipping cotton, and the soaring prices in the New York cotton market, market sentiment in Shanghai was strong. However, actual transactions were very quiet. Most were taking a wait-and-see approach.

### Silk and Tea: Foreign Silk Sweeps Away the Gloom

Yesterday, New York prices for near-term deliveries rose by 7 points, and far-term deliveries rose by 8 points. Yokohama prices for current deliveries rose by 40 yuan, and far-term deliveries rose by 52 yuan, sweeping away the gloom of the past few days. The expansion of the European war has led the New York market to expect transportation difficulties, resulting in the price increases. Shanghai silk market: White factory silk prices at 7-8 points. Yi Zhi Lian, Nader Chang, and others all made transactions at a price of 5,000 yuan, about 150 yuan higher than the lowest market price of the previous day. Chiffon silk trading was slow because the domestic silk prices soared, so the silk merchants and foreign companies silk prices were more than 300 yuan different. (Press: After the increase in domestic silk prices, chiffon silk prices had risen to 2,800 yuan, while foreign company purchase prices were only 2,500 yuan). So, there were only white head sporadic transactions. 190 packages of silkworm cocoons arrived from Wenzhou on the 13th, 812 cases of tea. 34 cases of tea were shipped to Hong Kong on the 14th.

### The Tea Market Trends Slightly More Active

Yesterday's tea market. Because sources of goods in various regions were disrupted, market sentiment suddenly improved. British merchants Jardine Matheson has already started soliciting purchases. Baochang, Dodd, Tianxiang and other firms all made small-scale purchases. The total transactions for new and old precious eyebrow green tea were over 370 boxes. The deals are mostly for medium and low grade goods. New precious eyebrow tea prices range from 350 to 370 yuan. Chen precious eyebrow tea prices range from 160 to 175 yuan. The market price did not change. However, foreign firms continue to consider the high grade extracted heart precious eyebrow tea expensive, actual sales are still slow.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Cake Sales also Affected by Drought, Overall Trend Still Strong

The bean cake market frequently shows prosperity. The potential trend is because of weather drought, parties have not yet taken in the suction, and at present the overall situation continues to transfer with the human heart, yesterday's market rose another point, estimating that with the help of the chemical gang a purchase of 1,500 pieces of Dayaos four-brand cake, inland trip-ups such as collecting Shenji cakes three or four thousand, Feizi cakes five hundred, Yuanji cakes five hundred, and each gang trip-up has reached a deal to deliver more than 20,000 pieces of Dayaos four-brand cake in the second half of June. The oil market continued to soften, actual sales were relaxed, and the floating trip-up put its hands up, so that the market was gloomy.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Price Increases

Yesterday, according to a Dutch wire, the C.I.F. price of coarse white sugar was US$3.17, up 5 points, and the foreign exchange rate grew increasingly tight, so the council's dividing plate then returned to shake, the base price for rough white 14 was 70-71 yuan, the outer base price for morning 70.5-71 yuan, afternoon the foreign exchange rate relaxed slightly, so it came back down, 70-70.3 yuan, with the result that it still rose eight points, transit goods 56.5-56.7 yuan, spot goods 56.2 yuan, afternoon 55.5-56 yuan, rising by nearly one yuan, Taikoo car white sugar rose by 0.5 in the morning, coming to 83 yuan, afternoon 82.2 yuan, falling a small 0.2, Dutch red sugar was still 60.5 yuan, the base factory snow white 71 yuan, the base number 1 ice 92.5 yuan, Míng ice 94 yuan, with no great changes.

### Hardware Black Iron Blanks: Prices Down, Sales Active

Black iron blanks have been recently pretty active. It is said that yesterday trips from Tianjin, Qingdao and Yantai gangs collected, reaching two or three hundred cases' tally, at the same time that local street factory-side also had the intent to go in, such as mirror factories, thermos factories, printing iron factories, etc., that they bought also had more than three hundred cases, so the market conditions were particularly good, and the human heart also appeared, that's because foreign exchange trends were soft, peers' center thoughts turned soft, and the ratios were such that the selling plate was reduced, so the good phenomenon of both yesterday and today came about. It is verified that the market quoted opening price was selling one thousand one hundred yuan each load (two thousand pounds), and when compared to its golden era had fallen two hundred yuan tally.

### Piece Goods: Significant Transactions in Autumn and Winter Woolens and Cloths

The woolen and cloth market atmosphere remained favorable yesterday. The overall market price has consistently been firm. Sellers are mostly holding onto their current stock, resulting in hoarding. There were significant transactions for autumn and winter dark-colored, heavy woolens and cloths. Merchants from Guiyang, Kunming, and Chongqing were all actively seeking supplies. The most popular items were dark black flannels, shawi (phonetic transliteration), medium-thick beiji (phonetic transliteration), Han Li Meng (phonetic transliteration), Hailiesi (phonetic transliteration), Holm Homespun (phonetic transliteration), Melton, overcoat cloth, thick plain cloth, and shoe felt. On the other hand, in this district, the popular items were riding breeches cloth, Tuo Si Jin (phonetic transliteration), suit flannel, men's and women's colored overcoat cloth, wool cloth, and Hai Bai Long (phonetic transliteration), etc. According to investigations, autumn and winter woolens and cloths were launched on the market early this year because of the difficulty and scarcity of shipments from Europe, resulting in low inventory. Prices may rise again in the future. Additionally, transportation difficulties for various customers have led to delays, and as a result, business operations have started earlier across the board.

Also, today, 367 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong, and 20 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.

### The Tension Has Disappeared and the Two Concessions Have Returned to Normal, There Is No Possibility of Conflict Between the Defense Forces of Various Countries, the French Consul Officially Denies Rumors

Although Italy has declared war on Britain and France, the security of the concessions in Shanghai will not be affected in any way. Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet, had taken precautions and invited the commanders of the defense forces of various countries in Shanghai on May 7 to discuss ways to maintain the status quo of the concessions. The commanders of the defense forces of various countries also deeply understood this and unanimously agreed, without any objections, and decided not to cause unnecessary disputes due to Italy's participation in the war, so that troublemakers would have an excuse and put themselves in an unfavorable position. However, there are various rumors outside, as if the situation in the concessions is very serious. According to observations of the situation in various parties, the US defense forces have also relaxed their vigilance in their defense area, which is not as tense as in the past few days. However, at present, the military authorities of the belligerent countries are trying to reduce various measures that may cause disturbances. The authorities of the two concessions are also doing their best to prevent friction between the belligerent countries. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:

Yesterday's Situation Became More Peaceful

After the news of Italy's declaration of war reached Shanghai, the commanders of the French and Italian defense forces reached an agreement on the morning of the 11th. The commanders of the British, Italian, and American defense forces reached an agreement on the 12th and have made proper arrangements to prevent conflicts between the troops of the belligerent countries. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the two concessions in Shanghai. Since the day before yesterday, the general sense of unease has disappeared. Yesterday, it became more peaceful. On the 11th, when the news of Italy's participation in the war first arrived here, the patrols of the US Marines in their defense area of the Public Concession increased. Since yesterday, it has been greatly reduced, which is a clear sign that the situation has relaxed and returned to normal.

The French Consul Officially Clarifies the Position, The Section About Expelling Italians from the French Concession Has Been Denied by the French Consul General in a Statement, the Consul General said: The French Concession will not take repressive measures against Italian expatriates within the concession. The authorities have not taken any action to expel Italians, as rumored outside. Also, the national flag of the Italian consulate was not forcibly removed by the French Concession authorities, but was removed by the consulate itself after receiving the notice of participation in the war. The authorities have also sent additional police officers to protect the consulate after Italy's participation in the war, but the consulate has sorted out documents and moved on its own. Also, according to the English "Great American Evening Post", the French Deputy Consul in Shanghai, Camare, visited the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an in the city center yesterday (12th) and officially guaranteed that the French Concession does not intend to change its current status. According to the rumor that the French Concession will be handed over to the US authorities, it was spread by a Japanese news agency a week ago, but the French and American consulates have denied it.

Japan's Attempts Are Difficult to Fulfill

Since Italy officially declared its participation in the war, Masayuki Tani, a decision-maker in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made a so-called "friendly advice" to the ambassadors of the belligerent countries stationed in Tokyo, hoping that Britain, France, and Italy would pay attention to the unpredictable events that might arise in China as a result of this. The implication is to demand that the belligerent countries

Withdraw as soon as possible

Troops in China, Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Yoshiaki Miura, flew to Ningbo on the 9th to attend the meeting of Japanese consuls in various parts of China convened by Abe. Now, due to Italy's participation in the war, Miura urgently returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 11th, and presented the same advice to the consuls general of Britain, France, and Italy in this city on the morning of the day before, stating

Japan's wishes, At the same time, Miura also notified the German and American consuls general in Shanghai of this intention. It is obvious that Japan has ambitions to seize the Shanghai concessions. However, the attitude of the British, American, and French authorities is very firm. It is believed that the troops will not be withdrawn, and the neutrality of the concessions can be absolutely guaranteed. According to a British diplomatic source yesterday, regarding the

Regarding the issue of the defense forces of various countries stationed in China, it has been heard that the defense forces authorities of various countries have consulted and decided to maintain the status quo and avoid conflicts between the defense forces of various countries. Therefore, as long as the defense forces of various countries can abide by this principle, no accidents will occur. As for some people who think that the withdrawal of troops is necessary to avoid hostile behavior, this statement is not credible. The defense forces of various countries are protecting their rights and interests, so they will never withdraw. Also, the US Acting Consul General, Mr. Patrick, stated that he did not want to consider the matter.

Restrictions on Leaving the Camp Have Been Lifted

The defense forces of Britain, France, and Italy in Shanghai have been restricting all but those on duty from leaving their camps since the morning of the 11th. Since yesterday morning, this restriction has been lifted. However, according to the agreement reached by the commanders of the various defense forces, the Italian defense forces are not allowed to enter the French Concession. The British and Italian defense forces in the Public Concession are not allowed to enter each other's defense areas, except for those who are free to walk within their respective defense areas. Also, the British and Italian defense forces are not allowed to enter the US military defense area of the Public Concession unless they have official duties.

American Soldiers Did Not Enter the Japanese Consulate

According to a news item in the Japanese-language Continental News yesterday, the general idea was "A US military officer was not stopped by the police of the Japanese Consulate and broke into the residence of the Japanese Consul Miura on Seymour Road in the US military defense area twice." Yesterday, the spokesperson of the US Consulate General in Shanghai denied this, saying "There is no such thing." Also, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, requested that this kind of situation only happened once, and said that it was thought that the patrolling person was a newly dispatched sailor who did not know that this was the official residence of the Japanese Consul General.

### German Expatriates Did Not Move to Hongkou, Germany Has Built a New Radio Station to Engage in Broadcasting

Mr. Corde, an information officer at the German Embassy in Shanghai, held a reception for journalists yesterday and made a statement on the recent situation in the European war. He defended the digging of the tombs of the fallen soldiers propagated by Britain and France. Regarding the editorial "Warning the Public to Maintain Friendship and Keep a Clear Head" published in the Continental Daily the day before yesterday, he said that the German Consul General had responded to it, and sincerely accepted the Continental Daily's well-intentioned advice. However, some rumors in the article were considered to be detrimental to Sino-German friendship and affected the atmosphere of security in Shanghai. He also denied the newspaper's publication that "800 young German men in Shanghai have been undergoing military training for a long time and can be dispatched in an emergency." As for the reporter's question about the report that 140 German expatriates moved to Hongkou, Mr. Corde said that there was no such thing. The German expatriates who live in the concessions are quite friendly with the expatriates and garrisons of other countries, and there is no need to move to Hongkou.

The Official Denies That German Expatriates Have Moved In

The Continental Daily reported that the Broadway Mansion Hotel yesterday (12th) firmly denied that the participation of Italy caused a large number of German expatriates in the two concessions of this city to suddenly move into the Broadway Mansion. It is said that the hotel has been fully booked for many months, and it is impossible for 114 German expatriates to move in. At present, there are about 80 German residents in the hotel.

Newly Established Radio Station Intensifies Propaganda

Since the outbreak of the European war, Germany's external propaganda in Shanghai has been broadcast by the Jianhua Radio Station on Foch Road in this city, broadcasting twice a day in the morning and afternoon. Since the expansion of the European war, the heads of diplomatic missions in various countries have felt the urgent need for propaganda, and have been working hard on the publication and broadcasting. It is heard that Germany has established its own radio station on Route Ghisi today, broadcasting the war situation and the current situation throughout the day from 7:15 am to 12:00 pm every day.

### The American Relief Fund Will Not Be Reduced After the European War, The War Period Is Longer, More Relief Is Needed

According to a member of the American Advisory Committee yesterday, the European war is in full swing, the war zone is expanding, and the number of refugees is increasing sharply. However, it is hoped that the American fund for relieving Chinese refugees will not be reduced due to the sharing of resources by European refugees. The period of the Chinese war is longer, and the famine in various parts of North China has been going on for years. The need for relief is even greater than that of European refugees.

### Suspension of Royal Airmail Service Due to Mediterranean Warfare; Only Sino-American and Sino-French Routes Remain; American Freighter "Caffeite" to Sail Only as Far as Mumbai

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After the outbreak of the European War, there was initially no impact on mail to Europe. However, after Italy declared war on Britain and France and began participating in the war, most mail to Europe was rerouted via the Pacific. Foreign merchants in this city often added the note "via Pacific, USA" to their letters. The post office had separate rates for overseas mail, depending on whether it went via the Suez Canal or the Pacific (or via the Trans-Siberian Railway to Europe).

Suez Canal Blockaded

Yesterday, a Reuters dispatch from London stated that the British authorities had blockaded the Suez Canal. From now on, all mail to Europe will undoubtedly be routed via the Pacific. Before the war, airmail to Europe was handled by the British Imperial Airways (I.A.L), the French Sino-French Aviation Line (.A.F.), the American Sino-American Aviation Line (P.A.A.), and the Dutch Airline (K.L.M.). As Dutch flights departed from Hanoi, they were not as fast as the Imperial Airways and Sino-French lines, so very few people used them. The British Imperial Airways flights departed from Hong Kong, passing through Hanoi, Saigon, Siam, Burma, Malaya, British India, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, as well as parts of Europe and various locations in Africa from the Gold Coast to Uganda. Due to the outbreak of war in the Mediterranean and Africa, resulting in obstacles to air routes, the Shanghai Postal Administration and its branches have suspended the acceptance of all airmail to be sent via the Imperial Airways, effective yesterday.

Postal Routes Subject to Change

Mail to European countries from Shanghai, including regular letters, express letters, postcards, parcels, and airmail, is still being accepted as usual. However, if the post office receives notifications from foreign postal administrations, it will announce changes or suspensions accordingly. Currently, there is no concern about the interruption of mail to Europe, as it will continue to be delivered via the Pacific and Suez routes. Mail to Australia, New Zealand, Indochina, and Pacific Islands will be routed via Manila, Surabaya, and Batavia. Mail to Central America and the Panama Canal Zone will be routed via Panama. Mail to Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Indochina, Singapore, Malaya, Siam, Burma, Dutch East Indies, Ceylon, India, Africa, Egypt, Suez, and Pacific Islands will be routed via Keelung, Singapore, Colombo, Marseilles, and Liverpool. Mail to Japan, Korea, Canada, the United States, and Europe will be routed via the Pacific, through Nagasaki, Kobe, and America. Detailed schedules for daily dispatches are in place. The postal administration will maintain the status quo until further notice.

"Caffeite" Arrives in Shanghai Last Night

The world-class passenger liner "Caffeite" of the American President Lines, originally scheduled to arrive in port this morning from the United States via Japan, actually arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 PM last night and docked at buoys 14 and 15. The company's passenger launch departed from the Customs Pier at 8:30 PM last night and returned with passengers to the Customs Pier at 10:00 PM. Thirty-eight passengers disembarked in Shanghai, with fifteen passengers continuing on to Southeast Asia and traveling around the world. The passenger liner will depart from Shanghai at 5:00 PM tomorrow (the 15th) as originally scheduled, heading for Hong Kong, Luzon, Singapore, Penang, Colombo, and Mumbai. Due to the outbreak of war in the Mediterranean, American liners will no longer travel through the Mediterranean but will instead return directly to the United States from Mumbai. It is reported that the cargo shipped from the United States on this liner will be unloaded in this city and later transported to Europe by other means.

Italian Freighters Likely to Suspend Service

Since Italy joined the war, Italian mail ships traveling to the Far East have already suspended service. As for Italian freighters sailing between Europe and the Far East, they are not officially ordered to suspend service. This reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Italian Shipping Company yesterday. According to a company employee, although freighters have not been ordered to stop, it is uncertain whether any such ships will come to the Far East in the future. According to observations in the shipping industry, now that Italy is participating in the war and the Mediterranean has been designated a war zone, no merchant ships will be able to operate there. Moreover, if Italian freighters continue to sail as usual, they will inevitably pass through the territorial waters of belligerent nations. Therefore, these ships are no different from mail ships and are likely to suspend service as well.

Italian Ships Along Chinese Coast Operate Normally

According to yesterday's English-language "China Press" report, the two Italian shipping companies on Guangdong Road will temporarily continue to send ships to Shanghai and other ports along the Chinese coast. These two companies have more than 25 ships in total. Their contracts to transport grain and livestock to Shanghai must be fulfilled, so they will continue to operate.

### Central Government Relief for Judicial Personnel; Registration of Experience Sought for Possible Employment

Yang Peng, President of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and Qiao Wanxuan, Chief Prosecutor, jointly issued Announcement No. 31 the day before yesterday, which stated: "According to Instruction No. 1740 from the Ministry of Judicial Administration dated May 25th of this year, the Ministry has been registering and assigning judicial personnel who have withdrawn from war zones or been dispersed due to budget cuts since the start of the war of resistance, and has been assigning them to vacant positions. However, those who left their posts for reasons other than the above are not eligible for the aforementioned relief. In addition, there are many qualified personnel who have been reviewed and registered for future use but have not been assigned due to the austerity measures implemented by various provinces. Recently, courts and prisons in various provinces are actively being improved and expanded, creating opportunities for promotion. In order to broadly recruit and meet needs, all judicial officials, prison staff, and court clerks dispatched by the Ministry or qualified through Ministry review who have the legal qualifications may submit detailed resumes, stating their previous positions, dates of appointment and dismissal, reasons for leaving office, or the date of approval for registration and the number of the qualification certificate, as well as the region they wish to serve, and their mailing address, and submit them to the Ministry or submit them through the local judicial authorities for review and registration by the Ministry, for possible use. In addition to separate orders, this announcement is hereby issued for general knowledge and to instruct all subordinates to be informed accordingly."

### French Concession Focuses on Public Health

The French Concession authorities in this city have always paid close attention to public health. Over the years, they have made many plans. They have recently compiled a report on the health situation in the Shanghai French Concession in 1939, describing various public health initiatives. It includes rich illustrations, charts, and statistics, and is particularly detailed, demonstrating the French authorities' concern for the public interests of the concession's residents.

### Cost of Living for Foreigners in Shanghai Increases by 50% in Recent August; Sharp Decline in Foreign Exchange Rate is the Main Reason; However, Foreigners' Incomes are Relatively High

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette published a report on the temporary cost of living index for foreigners. It was compiled by Professor Cai Zhengya of the Council's Industrial Department, based on detailed income and expenditure accounts kept by various foreign households. The index is divided into four types: American, British, Russian, and other foreign nationals. These four types are then combined into a comprehensive index. The reason for compiling separate indices is that the cost of living for foreigners in this city is not entirely the same. Each index is based on accounts recorded during the three months from October to December 1939, and the figures cover eight months from October 1939 to May of this year, with all details included. During this period, the cost of living rose month by month. The comprehensive index, with October 1939 as 100, rose to 149.45 by May 1940. In other words, since October 1939, the cost of living for foreigners has increased by 49.45%. It is said that the reason for publishing the temporary report is due to public concern about the rising cost of living. However, this research is still in the preliminary stage. Households must continue to keep accounts continuously throughout the year, and only then will the work be successful and of great benefit to the public. This temporary index was compiled to meet public needs, and the calculation work was extensive. After one year, it will be recalculated and compiled into a formal index. The report adopts an objective stance, listing only facts, figures, and the methods used. As for the appropriateness of the standard of living, such as food nutrition and other important issues, they will be studied further after the formal index is compiled. The main points of the report are excerpted as follows:

Accounting Households

Of the 111 households, 28 are American, 36 are British, 26 are Russian, and 21 are from other countries. The "other countries" refer to Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Norway, Portugal, and other countries. The 111 households contain a total of 380 people, including 129 adult men, 144 adult women, and 107 children, averaging 3.423 people per household.

General Income

The income of the accounting households ranges from 200 to 1,800 yuan in legal tender per month and above 1,800 yuan. More than 87% fall between 200 and 1,800 yuan, concentrated between 600 and 800 yuan. Those with incomes above 1,800 yuan are all paid in foreign currency. Income items include the husband's salary, cash allowances, in-kind allowances, income of other family members, board and lodging fees paid by guests, miscellaneous income, and temporary income such as bank withdrawals and loans. As for the percentage of total income accounted for by the husband's income, it is 82.91% for American expatriates, 87.75% for British expatriates, 85.19% for other expatriates, and 58.81% for Russian expatriates. On the expenditure side, the items are (1) food, (2) clothing and materials, (3) rent, (4) water, electricity, fuel, and refrigeration, and (5) miscellaneous. The percentage comparison table for the above five items by nationality is listed below:

Comprehensive Index

The temporary consolidated index, with October 1939 as 100, compares the most recent eight months from October 1939 to May 1940. First, the classification index and the total index are compiled according to nationality, and then the comprehensive index is compiled from the total index of each country, weighted by the number of people to clarify the general situation. Compared with October 1939, the comprehensive index for May 1940 is 149.45, with October 1939 being 100. It has increased by 50% in eight months. Comparing May of this year with April, it increased by 15.64 points, or 11.69%. During the eight months, the index rose month by month, especially at the beginning of 1940. In January, it jumped from 103.34 in December 1939 to 114.48, 120.12 in February, 125.87 in March, and 133.81 in April. Using the reciprocal of the May index as the purchasing power of money, the value of one legal tender yuan has decreased by 33.09% compared with seven months ago.

Chinese and Western Comparison

Since October 1939, the cost of living index for Chinese workers has been slightly higher than the index for Western expatriates. As of May 1940, the percentage is 54.26% for the former and 49.45% for the latter. The reason is that the prices of basic goods needed by Chinese workers, without which they cannot survive, have skyrocketed. This can be seen in the study of retail prices. The prices of basic goods used by Western expatriates have also increased, but not as drastically, and the percentage of household expenditure is not as large. Compared to bread for Western expatriates, rice for Chinese workers occupies a different position in terms of importance. The price of rice has increased more than bread. Chinese workers eat less meat and more vegetables, and the price of vegetables has increased more than meat and poultry. Similarly, the price of coal and coal briquettes has increased more than electricity and gas. The Chinese worker index was lower in March and April, while the Western expatriate index rose. The reason is that the price of rice and vegetables fell at that time, while the exchange rate declined, and imported goods became more expensive. This is why there is a difference. When the exchange rate changed drastically in May, both rose together.

Prices and Exchange Rates

Among various factors, retail prices in this city, whether they are imported or Chinese goods, all change with the foreign exchange rate. Therefore, the trend of rising and falling should be briefly described, and then the impact on the cost of living can be seen. Since the legal currency stabilized last year, it lasted for five months and then suddenly contracted in February of this year. As a result, retail prices went up. Therefore, the comprehensive index for May increased by 34.97 points compared with January 1940, that is, 30.55%. On May 1st, the British pound was still four pence and thirty-two thirty-seconds, and the US dollar was five yuan and fifteen sixteenths. On the 2nd, it suddenly tightened, and it was at its lowest on the 4th. The British pound was reduced to three pence and thirty-two fifths, and the US dollar was four and a half yuan. From the 6th, the exchange rate increased, and by the 20th, the British pound and the US dollar had returned to the original price on May 1st. Since then, the British pound has often been around four pence and one-eighth, and the US dollar around five and a half yuan. The shrinking of the exchange rate on May 2nd caused retail prices to rise instantly. Logically, it should not have been so fast. As a result, the market was chaotic. The price changed several times in one day, and the rise was unprecedented. After the 20th, although the exchange rate had returned to the original price on the 1st, retail prices did not fall, and even if they fell, they were not proportional, or even continued to increase. This can be seen in the weekly retail price survey. Therefore, consumers do not benefit from the return of the exchange rate, but are often harmed by the contraction of the exchange rate. In fact, when the exchange rate falls back, prices should decrease accordingly, which is fair.

### Italian Authorities Also Issue a Notice Prohibiting Trade with Britain and France

Since the Italian authorities in Shanghai entered the war, they issued Notice No. 1 to all Italian expatriates yesterday. The content is the same as the warnings previously issued by the British and French authorities to their expatriates, prohibiting trade with merchants of enemy countries. The notice stated that, in accordance with Italian law, any trade that can be considered to be in the nature of trading with the enemy is prohibited, and no money may be paid to the enemy. Overdue payments to enemy merchants or individuals will be regarded as debt waivers, but the amount owed must be paid to the Italian consulate.

### Chinese Representatives of the French Concession Rent Research Association to be Selected Soon

The increase in taxes in the two concessions is imminent. In order to prevent the spread of rent disputes in the concession in the future, the French Municipal Council has decided to organize a rent research association as an agency to study and restrict illegal rent increases, and has sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession, recommending two landlord (owner) representatives and two tenant (renter) representatives to participate in the discussion (the French side has also been invited to recommend representatives to participate). Yesterday, the person in charge of the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession declared to reporters that only two of the four representatives to be recommended have been internally determined. The rumors that all have been decided are not true. Even after all four candidates have been internally decided, they must be submitted to the French Consul General for approval before they can be produced. It is said that all candidates may be decided in the next two days.

### Flour Mills in Urgent Plea as New Wheat Supply Dries Up; Call on Authorities to Devise Appropriate Solutions

Since the new wheat supply was controlled by the Japanese in the production area, grain merchants and flour mills in this city have been in a panic. Although they have repeatedly discussed rescue measures, there is still no clue. Yesterday, the Shanghai Flour Milling Industry Association, for the sake of its own industry and the food supply of the citizens of this city, sent a letter to the Municipal Council asking them to devise appropriate solutions. The original letter said: (Omitted above) This year, Shanghai's food supply has been panicked from time to time, and the cost of living index has repeatedly broken records. For the benefit of the entire citizens, your council has repeatedly requested from January that our association's Fuxin and Fufeng mills sell flour at a flat price, to regulate the food supply. The flour mills felt that this was a righteous act, and they had no reason to refuse. Therefore, they complied with the request and did their best to suppress prices and fully allocate flour at a cost of more than 30 yuan per load of wheat, to sell flour at a flat price. Initially it was sold for 10 yuan, and then for 13 yuan and 80 cents. Although the export side was slightly increased, from spring to the present, for nearly six months, according to the flour sales statistics, 70 to 80% was used to regulate the food supply in this city, and less than 20 to 30% was exported. The financial sacrifice is, of course, not to mention. We have also racked our brains to manage the distribution. We have repeatedly reported to you, sir, and we trust that you have taken note. Now that the imported wheat has arrived in the required amount, the flour reserves will soon be sold out. If we want to continue to order imported wheat, not only is the current price too high, making it difficult to order again, but it is also difficult to obtain ship berths. Although the domestic new wheat has already arrived on the market, it has not yet arrived. During this period of alternating scarcity, the flour supply in this city will inevitably be unsustainable. Furthermore, there are many difficulties in procuring new wheat, and there is no guarantee of transportation. If the new wheat disappears, the raw materials will become a problem. Moreover, domestic wheat prices have repeatedly reached high peaks, even if they can come to Shanghai, they cannot be calculated at the current selling price of flour. Flour mills in Shanghai are in this environment, I am afraid that there will be no flour to meet the market. Even if we collect raw materials and try to start the machines, we cannot make infinite sacrifices with limited financial resources. Recalling the past situation, the flour mills have made their best efforts to struggle through the difficult process, and we can be found not guilty by the citizens. What is regrettable is that the food problem has not yet been resolved. Although flour is not the main food, it has a very important relationship with ordinary people. We are sincerely afraid that when the raw materials are not available and the factories are forced to stop, we will be criticized by the outside world. Therefore, we must first present the whole story and ask your council to plan ahead for the future of food and to carefully devise a proper plan. After all, the food supply is a problem for the entire city of Shanghai, and it is by no means something that a small number of citizens, such as flour mills, can handle. (Omitted below)

### Poor People from Ningbo and Shaoxing Fleeing Famine to Shanghai; Mostly Young Women; Hometown Associations Have Advised Against It

According to news from shipping circles, impoverished families from Ningbo and Shaoxing are fleeing famine to Shanghai in an endless stream, especially young women. These people either seek employment, or rely on relatives and friends. However, the prices in Shanghai are expensive, and life is by no means easy. As a result, some sell themselves as maids, while others fall into improper businesses, a tragedy of the human world. It is reported that most of the poor women from Shaoxing take sailboats from Houchai (Longchun Slope) and travel to Shanghai. Hometown associations in Ningbo and Shaoxing in Shanghai believe that the cost of living in Shanghai is high, and it is by no means a good place to escape famine. Unless they are sure of coming to Shanghai, they have tried to dissuade them, and are actively handling disaster relief in an attempt to remedy the situation.

Shaoxing Fundraising

The Shanghai Hometown Association of the Seven Counties of Shaoxing has advanced funds to purchase large quantities of imported rice to be transported to Shaoxing for relief in order to alleviate the rice famine in Shaoxing and alleviate public food panic. In order to expand the operation, the association is scheduled to hold a Shaoxing Public Food Relief Committee meeting at the clubhouse on Aierjin Road at 3 pm on the 15th of this month. It is said that at that time, they will discuss expanding the fundraising to relieve the people of Shaoxing. Relevant industry associations in Shaoxing, such as the lumber industry and the coal industry, have launched fundraising efforts, and the coal industry association held its 94th meeting of the Executive Committee at 3 pm yesterday, and resolved to launch the Ning-Shao Ping Tiao Rice Donation in the name of the association, which will be handled by all the executive and supervisory committees.

Ningbo Fundraising Association

In order to expand the operation, the Ningbo Shanghai Hometown Association's Fundraising Committee for Ningbo Relief Rice Donation is scheduled to hold its second fundraising conference at 2 pm on the 22nd of this month. It is reported that Feng Hua had abundant rainfall the other day, and the autumn harvest may not be hopeless.

Shiqi Donation

Each village and township in Shiqi Town, Ningbo, has a rice famine this time, and the public relief is being carried out. Recently, the donors have been quite enthusiastic. It is estimated that Ms. Yang donated 3,000 yuan, and the rest were hundreds of yuan.

Appeal for Donations

Yesterday, Zhu Chengxun issued a letter to the elders and villagers of Shaoxing in Shanghai, saying: Xiao County has fallen, and the National Army is holding on. Shaoxing City is protected, but the upstream traffic has been cut off. The highway is detoured, and the transportation is difficult. Food rice has risen to 100 gold per stone, and it is still difficult to buy. The disaster is probably the most severe in history. The military officials in Zhejiang are also unable to make up for it due to various difficulties. Recently, I heard that there is a food management office that gives food according to the population. This is indeed a method of control, but I am afraid that the design is late and it will not be possible to provide emergency relief. Those officials in Shaoxing cannot shirk their responsibility, and we people of Shaoxing should not abandon ourselves. Fathers and brothers in Shanghai, raising funds to buy rice, is because Shaoxing has a population of 1.6 million. Even if this is used for disaster relief, it is just a drop in the bucket. We hope that we will catch up quickly and work together for profit. Do not neglect because of the lack of resources. Do our best. As for the method of purchasing rice, sea transportation is open, and we should continue to do it. Each district in the province, such as Jin, Qu, and Yan, has rice stored, and the price is also relatively flat. It can be transported by highway, and it should be purchased immediately. I heard from the road that the car officials in each district are divided and closed, and they are not allowed to inject here. This is either a rumor or it is difficult due to military relations, which cannot be speculated by those outside. If we speak in ordinary terms, we are in the same province, why should we be divided? Please order from the public officials in the court and in the field.

### Coal Briquette Association Resolves to Sell at a Flat Price Tomorrow; Limit of 30 Cents Per Person; 5 Jin of Coal Briquettes

The sixth phase of flat-priced coal briquettes will begin on the 15th of this month. The Shanghai Mechanized Coal Briquette Industry Association held its 35th joint meeting of factory representatives at its clubhouse at 405 Tianjin Road at 3 pm yesterday, and resolved to allow the sale from June 15th to the 24th, with a limit of 30 cents per person, totaling 5 jin of coal briquettes. The time is from 4 pm every day (new time) until it is sold out. The coal briquette factories that supply flat-priced coal briquettes include: Yitaixing (daily) 440 loads, Nanyang 200 loads, Guohua 160 loads, Dongfang 150 loads, Guanghua 40 loads, Huacheng Cuiji 40 loads, and Jinghua 60 loads. A total of 1090 loads are sold daily. The motion to temporarily reduce the selling price due to the high cost of raw materials was also passed. The meeting ended at 5 pm. The address of the flat sale may be announced today.

### Chongqing Telegram States that American Church Destroyed by Bombing; Bible Society and Sabbath Society Both Bombed; Hundreds of Martyrs are All Civilians

According to yesterday's telegram from Chongqing obtained by the church in this city, when the Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing on Tuesday, two American church buildings there were destroyed, one was the American Bible Society and the other was the Sabbath Society, but fortunately no one was injured. At that time, a total of 100 Japanese aircraft participated in the bombing, dropping more than 150 bombs and incendiary bombs. Hundreds of people were killed, all of whom were civilians.

### Seeking Laboratory Supplies

A large factory is now planning to expand the laboratory. Those who have new or old glass products, Chinese chemical drugs, and various instruments for sale are requested to open the name, quantity and price, and send a letter to Post Office Box 1505 to wait for a reply.

### Dismembered Female Corpse Case: Four Suspects Arrested; Deceased Named Huang Jinxiu, Aged Twenty; Corpse Dismembered into Multiple Parts and Discarded in Various Locations; Detectives Sequentially Discovered Evidence and Arrested Suspects for Further Investigation

A woman from Pudong named Jinxiu (aged twenty), possessed some beauty and a frivolous demeanor. She resided at No. 15, Lane 40, Zhoujia Pai Road and worked as a female worker in the fine yarn section of the Japanese-owned Shanghai Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, leaving early and returning late daily. On the morning of the 9th of this month at 6:00 AM, she left home to go to the factory for work and never returned. The female tenant surnamed Ding had many male acquaintances coming and going, so no foul play was suspected. The day before yesterday at noon, in a wasteland on Meizhou Road, Yangshupu Road, a passerby noticed a leg and an arm tied with lead wire and discarded on the ground. He was startled and reported it to the Yangjipu Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene. They took the leg and arm to the police hospital, determining that they were female limbs dismembered within twenty-four hours. At 6:30 PM, the Chinese and foreign detectives handling the case found a female head near Ningguo Road, Hangzhou Road, about one hundred yards away. The left and right cheeks and lower jaw had knife marks, and nearby was a large tin can with obvious bloodstains. Shortly after, in a wasteland near Zhoujia Road, Yangshupu Road, they found a section of the body, and near the stack of the former Yong'an Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, they found an arm and a leg each. In this operation, the entire corpse of the woman was recovered and sent to the police hospital. Subsequently, Chinese and foreign detectives determined that it was the flesh of Huang Jinxiu, who had been murdered, dismembered, and abandoned. From 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the 12th, Chinese and foreign detectives arrested Sheng Hongsheng, a native of Changzhou and a doctor at Dongzhong Hospital, and Wu Cheng and Gu Licai (teachers at Sgao Elementary School), as well as Ding Jifa, a native of Ningbo (a coppersmith at a soda company), at No. 18 Linqing Road, No. 740 Hangzhou Road, and No. 15 Zhoujia Pai Road, respectively, all in connection with the case. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case, stating that the defendant Sheng Hongsheng had an affair with the deceased for years, and the defendants Wu and Gu, along with Sheng Hongsheng, had gone to the deceased Huang Jinxiu's home on the 7th of this month to borrow money. Ding Jifa had lived in the same room as Huang, and recently transacted a loan of one hundred and fifty yuan. A tin can was found in his room, identical to the tin can found near the deceased's head on Ningguo Road, Hangzhou Road. He requested that the case be postponed for a detailed investigation to ascertain the truth. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the four defendants, who all denied any involvement in the murder of Huang, asking for judgment. The court decided to remand them all to custody and reschedule the hearing.

### Three Children Kidnapped and Strangled to Death; Murderer Confesses to the Crime; Inhuman Act; Because the Children Were Acquainted with the Criminal, He Killed Them to Silence Them; Previously Defrauded of Three Thousand Yuan

Pan Xiangxi, the young owner of Yunji Clothing Company at No. 311 Tongfu Road, only nine years old, Yongkang, the five-year-old son of Shen Chen at No. 5, Lane 282, and Changfa, the eleven-year-old son of Wang Li at No. 5, Lane 336, all studied at the Zhiyi Elementary School in the nearby Dazhong Li (mistakenly written as Dazhong School yesterday). On the 11th of last month, Zhong Bingchu, a clerk at Yunji and a native of Pudong, and others, plotted to lure the above three children from school to a wasteland at the former site of the Oriental Library on Maishan Road, Zhabei, where they strangled them to death. They then sent letters to the families, demanding a huge ransom. The day before yesterday, the Central Police Station cracked the case, arresting the criminals Zhong Bingchu, Wu Shengxiang, and four others. The bodies of the three children were recovered and sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Another principal offender in the case, Zhong Jianchu (Zhong Bingchu's elder brother), also a native of Pudong, was arrested on the morning of the 12th. As he could not be presented in court, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning, where the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested his detention and joint trial.

Zhong Jianchu confessed that this case was committed jointly by his brother, himself, and Wu Shengxiang, among others. They discussed it beforehand in the bedroom of his residence at No. 21 Tongfu Road. Because life had become difficult since the war, they discussed kidnapping the young owner of Yunji to extort money. On April 5th of the lunar calendar (May 11th), they went to Zhiyi Elementary School and lured Pan Xiangxi out. Unexpectedly, the Shen and Wang children followed and went along voluntarily. They first went to Matuan to watch a play, then to the Bund Park, and at dusk, they took them to Baoshan Road. Because our faces were familiar to the children, and we feared they would identify us after being released, we had no choice but to find a way to kill them. First, Wu Shengxiang and I strangled Pan Xiangxi, the young owner of Yunji, with our hands. At that time, my brother Bingchu took the Shen and Wang children outside. After Pan died, Wu and I went out and brought the two children back, each strangling one. I strangled the nine-year-old Shen child to death, and Wu strangled the eleven-year-old Wang child to death. We buried them in a pile of rubble, then sent letters to their families, demanding a ransom of fifty thousand yuan. We negotiated a decision over the phone, and received a total of three thousand yuan in two installments.

### The So-Called "Economic Research Association" is Actually a Gambling Den; Foreign Press Urges the Shanghai Municipal Council to Take Action

According to the "Millard's Review," a number of Cantonese, supported by the Japanese authorities and puppet organizations, recently opened a gambling den at No. 82 Tongfu Road. The area is entirely within the Public Concession. Signs are posted inside and outside the gambling den, bearing the words "Economic Research Association." Several weeks ago, several trucks loaded with roulette wheels and other gambling equipment were transported into the gambling den, attracting the attention of the police. The police immediately dispatched patrols around the gambling den, strictly inspecting and questioning everyone entering the premises about their purpose. The gambling den's organizers previously spread a smokescreen, claiming that the "Economic Research Association" was an organization established to promote the "New Order in East Asia" and was therefore under Japanese protection, clearly intending to avoid police intervention, similar to the "Asia General Association" established on Gordon Road in the past. That association operated for over a year before a member of the Consular Body questioned the Japanese side about whether they were protecting it. The Japanese Consul-General immediately denied protecting the association, resulting in its closure. It remains to be seen whether the relevant authorities will take the same action against the newly established "Economic Research Association." We do not know whether Mr. Boling, the Director of Legal Affairs of the Shanghai Municipal Council, plans to prosecute the organizers and patrons of the gambling den. In fact, they have clearly violated the criminal law regarding gambling and should be brought to trial in the Special District Court.

### Mother and Daughter Strangled; Two Murderers Beheaded; Motive Was Greed for Money; Victims Were Wife of a Puppet Official

On the afternoon of the 13th of last month at 9:00 PM, a tragic case occurred at Room 29 of the Ronghua Hotel at No. 5, Lane 606, Fuzhou Road, where a mother and daughter were suddenly strangled to death. The two murderers fled without a trace. Details have been reported in various newspapers. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the two murderers, Ye Asan, about twenty years old, and Zhang, only seventeen years old, both from Pudong, were beheaded and their heads displayed to the public in the Sanguantang area of Pudong around the 1st of this month. The details are compiled below:

Persuasion with Sweet Words

Xu Nantang, a native of Pudong, served under Ding Xishan in the puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army" and frequently traveled to the office in Hongye Garden, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai West. Around the 10th of last month, Xu sent a letter to his wife, Mrs. Mou, in Taihiribashi, Nanhui, asking her to bring three hundred yuan to Shanghai for purchasing goods. After receiving the letter, his wife, being illiterate, took it to the Ye Qichang grocery store in the neighborhood and asked Ye Fanglin's son, named Asan, to explain it to her. Asan, driven by greed, conceived an evil plan, urging her to bring more cash to obtain greater profits. The woman, a rural housewife, was deceived by his sweet words and brought all her savings, over one thousand four hundred yuan in currency, along with some jewelry, to Shanghai. Asan, seeing his plan succeeding, volunteered to be her guide and also enlisted Zhang, an apprentice at the store, to accompany her with her child to Shanghai. They arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 13th, taking the "Shanghai Inland River Company Minnan Line" boat.

Murder for Money

They went directly to the Ronghua Hotel in Xiaohua Garden and rented a room, using the alias Wang Zhongli, a cloth merchant from Qidong. Ye and Zhang, taking advantage of the mother and daughter sleeping soundly, strangled them with trouser belts. After the act, Ye and Zhang took the money and fled. They hid in Shanghai for another day, bought clothes, and the next morning took a boat back to Dujiahang, Pudong, loitering around. His father, Fanglin, was alarmed and suspicious because Asan and the apprentice were missing. He also heard that Xu Nantang's wife and daughter had been strangled to death in Shanghai, which made him uneasy. He went out to look for Asan.

Returning Home in Finery

When he arrived at Dujiahang, he caught sight of Asan, dressed smartly and looking completely different from before. He hurriedly accompanied him home. In the process, his father repeatedly questioned him, and Asan finally confessed the truth, admitting to strangling Xu Nantang's wife and daughter, and stealing over one thousand four hundred yuan and some jewelry. Fanglin was shocked and sternly reprimanded him, while also trying to find a way to conceal the crime. He took him to his uncle (also holding a puppet position under Ding Xishan), who, after questioning him, handed him over to the puppet headquarters and ordered him to confess. At that time, Asan still tried to deny the crime, falsely claiming that he was staying in Shanghai to open a Yangtze Restaurant.

Revealing the Truth

The interrogators pretended to be on his side, saying that they could definitely help him and that his life would be spared. Asan believed them and recounted the entire story in detail. The "Puppet Headquarters" then arrested Ye Asan and Zhang. Xu Nantang, the husband of the deceased, served Ding Xishan diligently, so he was favored. After his wife and daughter were strangled, he investigated and hunted down the murderers. Once he learned that the criminals had confessed, he urged "Commander" Ding Xishan to inflict the death penalty to avenge the deceased. Ding agreed, and around the 1st of this month, the puppet "Headquarters" escorted the two criminals to the Guantang area for execution, and their heads were displayed to the public for three days in Taihiribashi Town.

### Zhou Jiyuan Black Shadow Painting Exhibition

The painter Zhou Jiyuan plans to publicly exhibit more than two hundred of his lifelong best black shadow paintings at the Hualian Amusement Club on Nanjing Road in the coming days. Mr. Zhou excels in black shadow painting, with vigorous brushstrokes and an antique style, possessing a unique flavor. The exhibition is expected to be a grand occasion.

Correction: In yesterday's newspaper report on the assassination of Lu Xihou, it was stated that Wang Gu Zhi was a social butterfly and that Mr. Mou had recently been involved in certain activities. After investigation, this was found to be inaccurate, and his wife's name is actually Wang Gu Zhi, not Wang Gu Zhi. This correction is hereby made.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Shandong is partly cloudy to clear, with strong southwest to southeast winds. There will be southeast winds here. The area south of Ma'an Island is cloudy, turning overcast with fog, and northeast winds. The typhoon center was located at 15 degrees North latitude and 134 degrees East longitude, within 120 miles, at 6:00 AM. The wind was from the northwest, and its strength is unknown. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in the city reached a high of 82.9 and a low of 67.1. On the same day last year, the high was 90.3 and the low was 68.0.

The presiding judge, Xiao Bianfen, reviewed the confession and ordered Zhong Jianchu to be detained and jointly interrogated with Zhong Bingchu and the other six defendants on the 19th. The corpses of the three children were examined by the procuratorate of the Special First Court, and their families were ordered to collect them for burial.

### Ten Thousand Yuan Check Stolen Midway; Robbers Fled with the Money

The Fengcheng Company at No. 2, Lane 107 (Anjili), Ningxing Street, French Concession, specializes in the wholesale of Fujian Xinghua longans. Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, the company instructed its apprentice, He Wenyu (age 19, native of Xinghua, Fujian), to take a check for ten thousand yuan in national currency from Tongyu Bank to No. 15, Lane 110, Tianjin Road, Public Concession, to cash it. Unexpectedly, as He Wenyu was walking near Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road, three robbers suddenly rushed towards him from behind.

Blocking his path, they asked He Wenyu what he was holding in his hand. He replied that it was a receipt. Without asking any further questions, one of the robbers snatched it from the apprentice's hand. Meanwhile, two robbers pulled out pistols to threaten him and forced the apprentice into a black car parked by the roadside. They drove to the front of the Guotai Xinji Restaurant at No. 28, Baliaoqiao Street, French Concession, where the car stopped. The three robbers then dragged He up to Room 312 on the third floor of the restaurant. The room had been booked by the robbers three days earlier. After the robbers dragged He

into the room, they stuffed cotton into his mouth and tied his hands and feet to the iron bed with ropes. The three robbers then told He not to make a sound, or they would take his life. After saying this, the three robbers turned around and went out, locking the door. One of the robbers went to the Chunyuan Bank to collect the ten thousand yuan in full and then fled. He Wenyu remained in the room for about an hour. When there was no movement, he tried to untie the ropes binding his feet.

He kicked the door, and the waiter of the restaurant heard the noise and realized something was wrong. He went to open the door and saw He's hands still tied behind his back on the bed. He untied the ropes and removed the cotton from his mouth. The apprentice reported the incident to the waiter, who immediately reported it to the police. After detectives were dispatched to investigate, He and the waiter were taken to the Lujiawan Police Station for questioning. The police then dispatched detectives to investigate the Fengcheng Company, which bailed out the apprentice. The police are still searching for the three fleeing robbers.

### The Hardships of Missionaries

The Western missionary Argi Pasha, recently traveled with fellow Christians to Changsha Prefecture, Hunan Province, to sell religious books. On April 25th, he wrote a letter to a friend, saying: "When our ship first arrived, it was immediately stopped by a patrol boat, which stated that we must first inform the local officials before proceeding. This is because everyone in Hunan hates Westerners. The official then came to the ship and told me: "It is very inconvenient for you to enter the city. The officials are also unable to protect you. As for the books you have brought, we are willing to buy them all. Please set a price." If you want to see the sights of Changsha, please travel by sedan chair." I said: "The books I have brought are intended to be sold to the people, so that they may be enlightened. I have not come to profit." The official spoke kindly and temporarily departed. The next day, anonymous notices were posted throughout the city, scolding Westerners and calling for their murder. Several of the notices stated that Westerners were the enemies of China and that China was a nation of literature. What we value is morality, yet Westerners want us to abandon it and follow them. How can their intentions be questioned? We view killing a Westerner as killing a dog. If we encounter a Western man, we treat him as a thief; if we encounter a Western woman, we treat her as a prostitute. When cutting grass, one must remove the roots." The next day, the official came again and said that selling books was not allowed and asked us to return to the ship immediately without entering the city, so that he could protect us to the best of his ability. We then agreed to go to another pier at a certain time to moor the ship and sell the books. However, we saw thousands of people crowding the riverbank. They were mostly scholars and officials. As soon as they saw our ship, they shouted loudly!"

Spring and Autumn

### No Report Card

— Qian Che

When my child came back from school, he brought two mimeographed slips of paper: one stating that he had passed the exam and would be promoted to the third grade next semester; the other stating that he needed to pay a retention fee of two yuan to register for the next semester. At first, I just glanced at them, because my child would definitely be going to school next semester, so I just needed to pay two yuan to register. But then I remembered that if he had passed the exam, why wasn't there a report card? So I told my child to ask at school. The reply was that it would take some time for the teachers to calculate the scores.

This was strange. If the scores hadn't been calculated, how did they know he had "passed the exam"? If they had already determined that he had passed the exam, the score sheet should have been filled out long ago. So I thought and thought, and I figured out the reason.

Every parent hopes that their child will pass and be promoted, so this promotion notice is actually a receipt for the fee. The school has figured out the parents' psychology, and the "pass and promote" notice is sent along with the retention fee notice. The so-called statistics are actually a budget of how much revenue they will receive next semester.

This kind of "reimbursement education" is the responsibility of both parties. Because many parents transfer their children to another school when they see that they have been held back. The school is afraid that students will "transfer" so they send the "pass and promote" notice before the grade report is calculated. However, the school is responsible for educating children, and if they are truly lagging behind in their studies, they should explain the reason to the parents, so that the parents can find a way to supplement their classes in their spare time. Otherwise, the more they are "promoted," the more difficult it will be for them to digest the material. At the same time, although parents all hope that their children will pass and be promoted, they don't necessarily think that "transferring" will make them smarter if they are really dull.

"Cramming" education is already unacceptable, let alone "reimbursement"? I ask that schools with this kind of "phenomenon" come to their senses and save our children.

### A Rice Shop

— Ji Runmo

Near my home, there is a small rice shop. I pass by it at least two times every day, and it is always the main object of my sight. A few days before May 2nd, I suddenly noticed a snow-white piece of paper on the plain door panel, with some words written in ink. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the prices of various types of rice. I then realized that they were complying with the pricing regulations. In the days that followed, I didn't notice anything new on that piece of paper.

On the evening of May 2nd, I got off the tram as usual and passed by the shop. The prices on the sign had changed. The price of foreign rice had increased by four yuan, and domestic rice was temporarily out of stock. This further increased my curiosity, and every time I passed by the shop, I would glance at the price list. In the next four or five days, the price of foreign rice continued to rise, either by one yuan or two yuan. So, the top-grade Saigon rice, which was forty yuan per picul on May 1st, and the number one Saigon rice, which was forty-two yuan per picul, had become fifty yuan and forty-nine yuan by May 6th.

After that, the exchange rate loosened, and rice prices also fell, but their price list remained the same. The only difference was that domestic rice was no longer "temporarily out of stock" but was on par with the top-grade foreign rice.

In recent days, the exchange rate and gold prices have been fluctuating, and rice merchants have been unreasonably raising prices. The shop has listed foreign rice at fifty-four yuan, while domestic rice is still "temporarily out of stock." At the same time, the front door is closed tightly, and another white piece of paper is posted on a wooden board, saying "Please use the back door." This has been the case for many days, and it is still the same now. I think this is a miracle in the midst of rising rice prices, so I record it here as material for someone to publish a "Chronicle of奸 Merchants'醜 Acts" in the future.

### Good News for the Poor and Sick

— A Luo

Friends:

Please don't neglect this fortunate news, and I hope you can pass it on to your acquaintances.

Doesn't Shanghai have over five million people? Do you know that many of them are suffering from various diseases? The rich can certainly stay in the hospital, enjoy the services of nurses, or spend dozens of dollars to have a doctor come to their home for a consultation. However, let's look at the many poor shop clerks and workers. How much do they earn? Do they have the same resources as the young masters and ladies to stay in the hospital or hire a doctor? Of course not. They can only lie in bed moaning, enduring until they can't endure any longer, and then spend a hard-earned dollar and eighty cents to seek outpatient treatment. As a result, their illnesses become more serious because they cannot rest and recuperate quietly, making treatment difficult. The number of people who die from this every year is undoubtedly in the thousands! Friends, this problem is too serious. How can we solve it?

Mr. Wen Jing was horrified by the situation. In order to seek the welfare of lower-class patients, he proposed to join forces with Mr. Zhong Ying and others to request the Relief Committee to allocate funds to establish a National Medical Public Hospital, so that the poor and sick who are forgotten in every corner of Shanghai can have a place to receive treatment without worrying about expenses. In other words, they can enjoy the same treatment as the rich.

The Relief Committee finally agreed to allocate two thousand yuan per month to subsidize the hospital. At the same time, Mr. Wen and others also organized a board of directors to raise funds for the hospital. Now, the overall structure has been completed. The location is the original site of the Guangyi Hospital on Laobosen Road. The opening date is around the end of this month. The doctors hired will all serve the patients with the greatest enthusiasm and perseverance.

Due to funding constraints, the hospital will initially have 200 beds. It is said that they will only be available to shop clerks and workers. They only need to be referred to the hospital after the board of directors investigates and confirms that they are seriously ill and unable to afford medical treatment. All expenses will be borne by the hospital until they recover and are discharged. A separate outpatient department will be opened to treat patients with milder conditions.

Finally, I have to be rude and nag you a little. If you still have some spare money, would you be willing to take some out to save some of these poor and sick people? Friends.

### Thoughts, Sights, and Sounds

— Yu Bi

A southern goods store on Xinzha Road has the brand name "Give It a Try." Inside the store, there is a slogan-like advertisement: "Tell them if you are satisfied after trying it; tell us if you are not satisfied after trying it. After seeing the goods, the difference between black and white is clear."

### Please Open on Sundays: A Request to the New Asia Library

— Wu

Libraries are the sustenance of mass culture and the repository of knowledge, open to everyone to explore this treasure trove. Several great people in the world have succeeded by immersing themselves in libraries. Therefore, libraries make a great contribution to society, and their mission is very arduous.

There are quite a few libraries in Shanghai, but if you want to find a public library with no class restrictions, a convenient location, and a large collection of books, then the New Asia Library is the best place. Although I have only been in Shanghai for a short time, I have become a regular reader at New Asia. I spend almost all of my spare time there, so I naturally have a very strong affection for the library. However, the library recently decided to close on Sundays for book organization and will not lend out books. Of course, this is necessary. A library with a large number of readers does need a considerable amount of time to organize its books, but I do not agree with setting the date on Sunday. Because Sunday is the day with the most free time for staff and students of general groups and institutions, and the best way to use this time is to read. Therefore, I hope that the library can change the day for organizing books to any day from Monday to Saturday. Anyway, this change has nothing to do with other readers, but it will allow readers with weekly holidays to have more opportunities to read. I hope the New Asia Library authorities will accept this request.

Hawthorne's Case

### The Dancer's Homecoming

— Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter One "A Very Pretty Young Lady!"

Hawthorne also began to look at Detective Ni. Ni Jinshou pointed with his finger to the edge of a piece of glass on the teak desk in front of him, answering Hawthorne's unspoken question.

"This is the fatal bullet. But there's no gun."

Indeed, I saw a small bullet close to the edge of the thick glass. You wouldn’t notice it if you didn’t pay attention. Hawthorne reached out, picked up the bullet, looked at it in his palm, and placed it back on the table.

He asked, "This is a .45 caliber. Where did you find it?" Ni Jinshou said, "Right on that wall." He turned his body and pointed to the wall behind him again.

Hawthorne followed the direction indicated, bent down, took the deceased's chest as a starting point, measured with his eyes, and then nodded. He bent down again to examine the back of the chair and touched the leather cover on the back of the chair.

He said, "Yes. The bullet also passed through the back of the chair. But it's not obvious at first glance; we have to rely on your sense of touch to distinguish it... Jinshou, there should be a bullet hole in her back."

Ni Jinshou nodded. "Of course," he said, and began to cut the back collar of the long robe and shirt, while supporting the corpse, leaning it slightly forward.

I saw that there was indeed a bullet hole in the woman's back, but it was very small, as if it had shrunk, and there wasn't much blood, only a slight redness. Hawthorne walked to the wall and looked at where the bullet hit, and then measured the straight line of the gun again from there with his eyes. Then he returned to the corpse and lowered his head to measure the straight line to the outside of the window. The steel window was open at this time, and the light yellow perforated curtains were also drawn open. (Fourteen)

### German Wartime Film Propaganda

— Xin Fang

In modern warfare, film has indeed become the most important propaganda weapon for belligerent countries. After reading the following example, we cannot deny this statement even more. When the Nazi German army marched into and occupied Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, that very night, the German commander immediately ordered the local film merchants that all anti-German films were not allowed to be screened, and violators would be subject to extreme punishment. Even American-made newsreels were banned.

Now, in Copenhagen, regardless of the size of the cinema, all the films being screened are German films, directly supplied by Nazi film producers in Berlin. The content, of course, exaggerates Germany's power. It is said that after the German army occupies a place, they use this kind of film propaganda.

The Danish women usually worship several stars on the screen, such as Kaer Mann, Eager Flilin, and David Niven. Today, they can only temporarily say, "Goodbye!" Seeing this situation, anyone will be moved. It is a tragic thing to be invaded and unfortunately destroyed. At that time, the right to "enjoy freedom" is absolutely unattainable!

Recent Film City News

### Paramount Sues Don Ameche

— Min

Don Ameche recently starred in the Paramount film "One Night in January." Shortly after filming began, Don Ameche suddenly refused to continue filming for unexplained reasons. After several mediations, he finally refused to propose a compromise solution, which led to a stalemate. Paramount Pictures was furious and filed a lawsuit in federal court, presenting the signed contract as evidence, demanding compensation for losses of $170,000. This lawsuit caused a stir. As a rule, the company is unwilling to submit the contract signed with the actor to the court. This shows the seriousness of the matter. No wonder it caused such a commotion. To date, this lawsuit has not been judged.

Two years ago, Paramount actor Waltes Catlett quit halfway through the film "I'm From Missouri." The company sued, demanding compensation for losses of $8,000. The court ruled that the defendant should pay $6,000 to settle the matter. In addition, there were many similar incidents, but they did not go to court. As early as 1934, Spencer Tracy, affiliated with Fox, suddenly did not show up for several days while filming. The company sued, demanding compensation of $40,000. The court ruled that if the defendant did not compensate for the losses, he would have to tear up the contract. As a result, Spencer Tracy was willing to compensate with the salary for filming a movie. Although these cases are similar to the Don Ameche case, they are not as serious as the current one.

### Random Notes on the Film Industry

— Wang Lun

Regarding the origins of film production in our country, Mr. Zhou Jianyun's "An Overview of Theaters" states: "In the second year of the Republic [1913], American Ishill came to China to produce Chinese films for the Panama Exposition. Zhang Shichuan, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Du Junchu organized the Xinmin Film Company."

Furthermore, the "Chronicle of Chinese Industries" compiled by the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry states: "The film industry in China was actually started by foreigners. In the first year of the Xuantong reign [1909], American Braturky organized the Asia Film Company in Shanghai. In the second year of the Republic [1913], American Ishill traveled to China. At that time, modern drama was flourishing. Ishill used modern drama actors to produce films. Everything was organized by foreigners, and Chinese people only acted."

Based on this, the era of our country's independent film industry should be based on the former.

The first domestic film was called "The Wronged Soul of the Black Register." The screenwriter was Zheng Zhengqiu, and the director was Zhang Shichuan. At that time, the expressions in the films were crude, the movements were slippery and absurd, and men dressed as women. No wonder (it was not strange) that there were such things.

Chen Yunshang's "Mulan Joins the Army" can be said to have caused a sensation. If you take out the "Mulan Joins the Army" filmed by the early Minxin Company and show it again for comparison, there would be a world of difference.

I often meet Huang Nai in the morning. She takes a small pug out of her house on Baylor Road, past Lafayette Road. The big ones go to the flower garden in Gujiazhai, looking very relaxed.

### Laurel and Hardy's expression in the new film "Saps at Sea" (freely translated as "Sea Idiots")

### Jin Suqin's New Developments

— Xing Gu

Jin Suqin, who originally planned to continue Wang Xichun's troupe in Hong Kong, but found that Hong Kong was not suitable for Peking Opera performances, returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the ninth of this month. Yesterday, the reporter visited her home, not only learning about her situation in Hong Kong, but also indirectly learning about the popularity of Peking Opera in Saigon, Annam.

It turned out that Jin Suqin had contacted Huang Hui'an, the representative of Saigon's Zhonghua Grand Theatre, to prepare for a performance in Saigon. So yesterday, coincidentally, Mr. Huang Hui'an was introduced to her home by Miss Jin. He said that there were many overseas Chinese in the Saigon embankment area, most of whom were Fujianese. They all loved Peking Opera very much. There are many Peking Opera theaters in the embankment area, including Continental, China, and Zhonghua Grand Theatre, which is the largest in Saigon.

Now, Miss Jin and they have signed a contract for two months of performances under the name of the Zhonghua Opera Troupe. The Zhonghua Opera Troupe was founded by her and Ouyang Yuqian after the "August 13th" incident, with the aim of reforming and progressing in a positive manner. However, it was later forced to suspend operations due to the environment.

This time, she is regrouping and recruiting new members, intending to perform in a reformed Peking Opera style. If she really does this, then she is indeed a forward-thinking figure among the female Peking Opera performers of today who can say and do things. She will probably leave in about half a month.

### Valuable Gift

— Yong

Recently, Shirley Temple received an extremely valuable gift while filming "Young People"—a box of assorted candies weighing 200 pounds. It was presented to the young star in Hollywood by Ms. Louis Kiradaline on behalf of the Western Candy Merchants Association of San Francisco. It is said that after receiving the gift, Shirley Temple immediately donated it to the children in 14 local children's homes in Los Angeles.

### The Lineup for "Li Xiangjun"

— A Han

The China Travel Theater is very careful about this public performance of Mr. Zhou Yibai's "Li Xiangjun." Firstly, it must meet the requirements of a historical drama, and secondly, it must promote the spirit of art above all else. Therefore, no carelessness in manpower and resources is allowed, and the attitude towards work is very serious. The female lead, Li Xiangjun, is generous and passionate enough to compare with Ge Nenniang; therefore, they specially urged Yong Ruoqing, the actress who played Ge Nenniang, to come to Shanghai to play Li Xiangjun. At the same time, Mr. Bu Wancang was invited to be the director to achieve the effect of art. Now, Tang Ruoqing has arrived in Shanghai on the third, and the rehearsal has already started the next morning.

The entire cast has been completely arranged. In addition to Tang Ruoqing's Li Xiangjun, there are Lan Yan's Li Zhenli, Sun Jinglu's Zheng Tuoniang, Liu Lian's Bian Yujing, Zheng Yulin's Hou Chaozong, Wang Xianzai's Ruan Dawei, Huang He's Chen Dingsheng, Li Jingbo's Liu Jingting, Ge Xin's General Wang, Wu Jingping's Zhang Kuiguan, Cheng Qing's Bao'er, Xia Duowen's Maid, Zhao Shu's Yang Wencong, Zhou Chu's Ma Shiying, Tang Qi's Han Zanzhou, and Wang Hui's Rourou. At the same time, the head of the troupe, Tang Huaiqiu, will also play the role of Prince Fu in a villainous manner. Prince Fu is a mediocre and incompetent person. In the fourth act, he summons Xiangjun to perform in the palace, but is ridiculed by Xiangjun. The confrontation is very lively. At that time, the father and daughter will be at loggerheads and will be outstanding.
