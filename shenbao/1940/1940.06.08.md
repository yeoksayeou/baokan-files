### Various Chinese Armies Implement Blockade, Japanese Crossing of Han River Already Encountering Resistance, Fierce Fighting Developing West of Jiukou Near Qianjiang, Japanese Morale Extremely Disorganized Since Retreat from Xiangyang

Shashi: Fierce fighting is gradually developing in various locations west of Jiukou near Qianjiang on the west bank of the Xiang River. After the Japanese army crossed the river and invaded westward, their rear was exceptionally vulnerable. Chinese forces, hidden near the fords downstream after completing their surveillance of the Japanese, acted with extreme agility, swiftly moving to exploit the situation. On one side, they launched attacks on the Japanese rear, dealing them fierce blows, while simultaneously launching attacks from various concealed locations, seizing Japanese crossing points. One force is currently engaged in bloody battles with the Japanese on both sides of Shayang, another has appeared at Gaoqiao City, Caijiazu, across from Duobaowan, and yet another is launching attacks from the southeast of Banghan Town, advancing towards the fords across from Sigang City. Various Chinese armies are poised to complete a strong blockade. Currently, the Japanese on the east bank have no possibility of continuing to cross, while those who have already crossed to the west bank and continue to advance southward have no hope of survival. The most thorough and complete annihilation battle will certainly be completed as planned. (7th dispatch)

Yichang: The Japanese army, which forcibly crossed from Sigang, suffered heavy casualties from Chinese attacks. The Japanese once reached west of Xiawahu, but were driven back by the courageous attacks of the Chinese army.

Chongqing: According to today's Chinese war news, Chinese troops have concentrated in Yichang, preparing to resist the Japanese attack. In central Hubei, 30,000 Japanese troops crossed the Han River to the vicinity of Xiangyang. Another 15,000 Japanese troops crossed the lower reaches of the Han River between Shayang and Qianjiang, and the fighting is particularly fierce. It is also reported that yesterday, on the west bank of the Han River near Shayang, 3,000 Japanese troops charged the Chinese positions, but were met with deadly fire and over 700 were killed.

### Another Proof of the Consolidation of the Legal Tender

Whenever there is any development in the European war situation, the Shanghai market sees another round of rumors. Recently, regarding whether Italy will participate in the war and the German army's advance on Paris, speculators have all used them as material for speculation, believing that anything that affects foreign exchange will inevitably have such and such consequences. What is said may not be accurate, and much of it is not in line with common sense, but those who talk about it revel in it, spreading it from ten to a hundred. Is this not what is called a war of nerves? One must know that the hub of today's global foreign exchange market is not in London, but far away from Europe in New York. When the British and French allied forces entered Belgium to fight, Belgium's gold flowed to Britain; and when the allied forces suffered losses in Belgium, the gold of Britain and France flowed to the United States again. The most recent shipment to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was a record amount of US$286.72 million. We have long known that the only authority that determines global exchange rates is the United States. If the United States does not change its foreign exchange rates, it will fall into trouble itself. This newspaper said this two months ago. As for yesterday's New York dispatch, the exchange rate against the British pound suddenly rose on the 6th, and the US dollar in Shanghai relaxed accordingly. The matter has already revealed its clues, and how it will move in the future is worth paying attention to. However, some say that the loosening of the Shanghai foreign exchange market the day before yesterday was due to Japanese merchants releasing foreign exchange to absorb legal tender for the purchase of silkworm cocoons. Where there is smoke, there is fire, and it must not be without reason. This has a close relationship with China's economy.

The Japanese have been deliberately plundering resources and absorbing money, which is a prominent fact. The so-called "China Central Silk Company" is clearly a disguised Japanese silk trust. Before the silkworm eggs hatch, they have already made loans to unscrupulous merchants and local bullies everywhere, so that they can set up cocoon collection factories in the production area, as a plan to exhaust everything. They also use silk merchant scum, at their instigation, to run errands for them and set up factories to reel silk, so as to achieve their goal of encompassing everything without omission. The meaning of this is not normal trading, but using China's legal tender to absorb China's products, and then using the products to exchange for huge amounts of foreign exchange, so as to cultivate economic power and purchase sophisticated military fire, which is what is called using war to support war. There are many similar cases. The so-called "control," big or small, is not spared, from small vegetables and fruits to large mineral products and industries, cleverly plundering and seizing, swallowing like whales and devouring like silkworms. Although one says "returning," and the other says "receiving," it is not just empty words and no real benefits, but taking the pearl and returning the casket, a technique of stealing names and deceiving the world.

In its aggression against China, Japan has always thought of using the "using Chinese to control Chinese" trick. Politics is like this, military force is like this, and why not economics? And the biggest goal of economic exploitation, in its initial stage, is to "use war to support war," and in its ultimate stage, to "use China to support Japan." If you want to support, you must take something, and taking must be done by force. Force has the distinction of financial resources and military force. Financial resources are not owned by Japan, and hoping that the Japanese will help with financial resources is like a fool's dream. Therefore, it must be done mostly through military force. The relationship between military force and economy is unreasonable. Under the guise of cooperation, it carries out its hegemonic occupation. The first goal of hegemonic occupation is goods that can be exported to earn foreign exchange; the second is exploitation to the point of the masses' daily life, such as rice, wheat, cotton, and vegetables, all of which are on its list. This year's wheat and rapeseed have also been controlled and taken away by the Japanese. Therefore, the serious pain suffered by the residents of the occupied areas today is all "granted" by the control. The various offensives of the Japanese side are mutually reinforcing and inseparable. If we speak from the economic aspect, then "politics" is actually the tool.

What the Japanese lack is foreign exchange. Although the Japanese have their legal exchange rate, it is like a flower in a mirror, impossible to catch. Industrial and commercial operators have almost no foreign exchange to obtain, and if they do, it is only in the Shanghai black market that they can get whatever they want. The Japanese know this, so they still want to use legal tender to seek foreign exchange. In China's Northeast Four Provinces and Hebei Province, although they have long been included in the yen bloc, the Japanese still avoid and reject it, like preventing an epidemic, seeking to isolate it in practice, and ensuring that it is practically insulated from the yen. On the one hand, they use "joint banknotes" as a tool to link them to legal tender and advance into the Shanghai black market. Therefore, legal tender is something they must fight for. Customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes are all forbidden fruits, and are sources for plundering legal tender. Because they must have legal tender, only then can the banknotes of the so-called "yen bloc" in northern China have any value to speak of; without legal tender, they will become waste paper. Therefore, the Japanese use legal tender to purchase Chinese products, and use Chinese products to exchange for foreign exchange, which is currently the only useful way. For this reason, before their feathers are full, they will not want legal tender to be easily destroyed. It can also be seen that the foundation of legal tender is far above various currencies in East Asia, and its power cannot be easily insulted. Those who hold legal tender and doubt it are truly worrying and ridiculous.

However, there are things that cannot be ignored; that is, the current fate of legal tender, which has a malignant tumor and parasitic worms, is very easy to be a health hazard for legal tender. The health of legal tender does not lie in the amount of the fund, but in the trust of the people; therefore, it is absolutely inappropriate to give people the opportunity to take advantage of the situation, and it is even more inappropriate to make light moves that shake the belief in legal tender. One must know that legal tender is worth money, so the Japanese seek legal tender so urgently. To seek the stability of legal tender, it is better for those who hold legal tender to use it more frugally, and it is even better not to let it fall into the hands of others. In short, if I have legal tender, I will keep it, how can others get a large amount of legal tender to cash in my foreign exchange! Therefore, the more everyone reduces the consumption of legal tender, the more consolidated the foundation of legal tender will be. This is obvious.

### Japanese Prime Minister Yonai Elucidates Foreign Policy: China Policy Follows Predetermined Procedures; Policy of Not Participating in the European War Remains Unchanged

Tokyo - Prime Minister Yonai elucidated the Japanese government's foreign policy when hosting Japanese journalists. Part of his remarks is as follows: "The handling of the China Incident is currently proceeding according to predetermined procedures. I firmly believe that the handling of the incident will follow the basic principles considered by the central figures of the 'New National Government of China' and representatives of the Japanese government on November 30th of last year. The instructions to Ambassador Abe decided at the Asia Development Board meeting on May 31st will be issued within a considerable period. I have heard rumors criticizing Ambassador Abe for dereliction of duty. Abe is fulfilling the mission entrusted to him by me and the Foreign Minister in China. Before the final instructions arrive, he is busy exploring the opinions of the Chinese side and studying matters related to fulfilling his duties. Criticism is unwarranted simply because things do not seem to be proceeding quickly. I do not wish to announce the contents of the instructions to be sent to the ambassador, but a portion of them may be released in the future. The Asia Development Board is currently formulating the basic terms for the start of Sino-Japanese negotiations into a legal format. I believe that Ambassador Abe, based on these instructions, can reach an agreement with the 'Wang regime' and achieve satisfactory progress. Rumors believed in some quarters that negotiations will begin directly with Chongqing are completely unfounded. There are rumors that a third country is making some movement towards the Chongqing government, but as far as I know, there is no new activity. I personally believe that the China Incident can be resolved as quickly as possible. I have heard that Italy was the first to officially recognize the new government of China. As for the attitude of other third countries towards the 'new regime,' I have no knowledge. The Yangtze River will be reopened as soon as possible. This is a matter of principle, but it has not yet reached the stage where I can announce a definite date for the reopening. Recognizing the new regime as soon as possible is the policy of the Japanese government. The government intends to do so after the signing of the basic Sino-Japanese treaty. The Japanese government's policy of not participating in the European war remains unchanged. However, if the continued development of the European war indicates that the end of the war is near, the Japanese government will have its own measures to deal with such a sudden change. The reason why the Japanese government adopts a non-participation policy is that it believes that it is currently advantageous to observe the changing times. As for the outcome of the European war, it may end sooner than generally expected. Whether Britain and France will admit defeat is still questionable, and what Germany will do to Western Europe if it wins is also quite speculative. Japan's policy towards the Dutch East Indies was recently stated by the Foreign Minister and remains unchanged. Some say that if the current situation deteriorates, Japan should urgently occupy the Dutch East Indies to guarantee it, or at least reserve the right to dispose of the issue. The Foreign Minister's recent statement on the Dutch East Indies has prompted the idea that Japan should reserve the right to speak on the issue. From Japan's point of view, it really wishes to maintain the status quo of the area. Japan sincerely wishes to cooperate closely with the Dutch East Indies and increase trade relations between the two sides, which seems to be a way to achieve this. Whether the United States will join the Allied side in the European war is still unclear. Judging from the situation, there is a high possibility of joining. If so, it will change the scope of Japan's concern for the Western Pacific. The United States, because of the need to take action, will disregard Japan and join the war. The US fleet now seems to be gathering in the Pacific, thinking that this can put pressure on Japan, but the Japanese naval power does not feel pressured by the appearance of the US fleet in the Pacific. The ratio of US-Japan naval power is not to be feared. Moves to end the current poor relationship between the US and Japan are currently underway, but its nature cannot be disclosed here. This movement has not yet taken a definite form. Japan does not want to send a special envoy to the United States. All pending issues between the Soviet Union and Japan should be resolved quickly. Now, for the sake of a better relationship between the two countries, in addition to diplomatic efforts, political movements should also be made. Once the time is ripe, practical consideration is often given to such opinions. Today, the Soviet Union seems to be more concerned about Europe than about the Far East." (Reuters, 6th)

### German Army's Forty Divisions Continue Fierce Attacks on French Positions; French Troops Fight Heroically and Defend the Lines; Breakthrough of Over Ten Kilometers in the Amiens Area; French Air Force Assists in Battle, Destroying 400 German Tanks

Paris - The General Headquarters announced this morning that after a period of lull last night, the fighting on the Somme front resumed this morning, with the situation roughly the same as yesterday. (Havas, 7th)

Paris - Military figures here recently stated that fighting broke out again on the front this morning, with the situation as fierce as yesterday. French troops have been fighting heroically along the coast to the Aisne River for two months. The situation is roughly as follows: (1) On the south bank of the Somme, the German army has already crossed the lower reaches, and the Allied forces are now defending the La Bresle River. (2) There are no major changes in the central Amiens area. The French army is still defending the outskirts of the city. The German army has launched repeated fierce attacks on the Bezons area, but the French positions have not changed much either. The German army is fighting on this line with a total of about 1,000 tanks, which is the strength of two mechanized divisions. Only in certain places has it slightly invaded the French positions, advancing at most ten to twelve kilometers, and the infantry has failed to keep up. On the right flank, between the Aisne River and the Aisne-Marne Canal, the German side concentrated 40 infantry divisions and four or five mechanized divisions, launching fierce attacks on the French positions, similar to the early stages of the Meuse River battle on May 19. Both sides' air forces were dispatched. German aircraft repeatedly flew to the rear of the French army and the central and western regions for reconnaissance. The activity of its bombers was less than in the previous few days and did not participate in the battle. The bombing targets were French transportation lines, such as highways, bridges, ports, and airfields. A large batch of German aircraft, about 200, flew over the Paris area this morning, and air raid sirens sounded immediately. However, the purpose of the German aircraft and the results of the bombing are not yet known. As for the French air force, it assisted the army in fighting on the front lines. 400 German tanks were destroyed yesterday, all of which were hit by bombs dropped by French aircraft. In addition, French aircraft also attacked the German rear, all the way to the Rhine River. British aircraft also bombed German concentration points in northern France and attacked cities in Belgium, the Netherlands, and western Germany. (Havas, 7th)

Paris - Recent French military communiqués stated that fierce fighting is still continuing on the various fronts from the coast to the "Avenue de la Grande Armée." The enemy army is participating in the battle with a large number of tanks. Many locations on the battlefield have concentrations of 200 to 300 tanks. It is estimated that the total number of tanks used by the enemy army is over 2,000. Our divisions are fighting bravely. Each infantry battalion, company, and half-company and artillery are defending solid locations to resist the tank attacks and destroy them with artillery fire. Our aircraft have attacked armored vehicles with bombs and guns, assisted by infantry and artillery. Without rest, they are all honored to face the upcoming battle. More than 200 enemy tanks have been destroyed. Some of our squads were submerged and surrounded when dealing with the enemy's unprecedentedly dense attacks, especially those in the lower reaches of the Somme River. The enemy army has invaded the area as far as the Bresle River. The enemy detachments in the Artois area have also advanced to the high ground on the right bank of the Aisne River. The morale of our army is very high. Our aircraft continue to destroy the railways in the Rhineland and the factories in the Rhine region. On June 5th, our fighters and anti-aircraft guns confirmed that 36 enemy aircraft were shot down. In addition, seven enemy aircraft were hit or destroyed. There is nothing to report from the rest of the front line. It is expected that the enemy army will attack the Verdun area, but it has not materialized. (Reuters, 7th)

Paris - Military figures here recently stated that the German army has launched another major offensive, with everything similar to the early stages of the Meuse River battle. The German side is now concentrating a large number of troops and 2,000 tanks, launching fierce attacks on the French positions, but the French army is defending strongly. The German army has only made slight progress on the left and right flanks. Its left flank is in the lower reaches of the Somme River, and its right flank is on the Artois Canal. The German army has gathered heavy troops there to assist the tank corps in advancing, having penetrated ten kilometers. However, the French positions have been able to resist effectively due to the anti-tank defenses. By evening, hundreds of German tanks had been destroyed, most of which were bombed by French aircraft. (Havas, 6th)

### German Army Only 100 Kilometers from Paris; France Decides to Defend the Capital with All Its Strength; Strict Measures Adopted to Prevent Paratroopers

Geneva - After the German army broke through the "Weygand Line," it is only 100 kilometers from Paris. The French General Staff is currently preparing to defend the capital. In the past two days, the main roads leading to Paris and the various squares have been blocked with vehicles and obstacles to prevent German aircraft from landing. (Haitong, 7th)

Paris - Military authorities took strict measures yesterday to deal with possible German airborne landings and attacks. People in Paris entering the city were surprised to see buses with shelters placed in the wide streets and squares. The Ministry of War recently issued a communiqué again, telling the public not to worry about the measures taken in Paris and elsewhere in the country, saying that it is only natural to take precautions to resist possible paratroopers or troop-carrying aircraft landings and should not be taken to mean anything else. (Reuters, 7th)

### Weygand Encourages the Three Armies: Advance, Do Not Retreat

Paris - General Weygand, the Commander-in-Chief, today issued an order encouraging his troops to continue the heroic spirit shown in the first two days of the war to resist the German offensive. The order was broadcast by the Paris wireless radio, saying, "The order is to stand firm or advance, and not to think of retreating. Officers of all ranks should think of your homeland and be filled with unwavering determination. We should follow the example set by glory, and courage and determination will always lead to victory. To defend the land of France and only look forward, the Commander-in-Chief has made preparations to provide assistance in the rear. Our homeland, our future, and the future of your children all depend on your perseverance." (Reuters, 7th)

### German Army Attacks with Smoke Bombs, Penetrating Five Miles into the Weygand Line

Paris - A French Ministry of War message last night stated that German tanks charged towards the Weygand Line, one of the Amiens defenses, yesterday, attacking the golden defense line. 200 tanks were lost, either captured or destroyed by fierce French artillery fire. The deepest penetration point was Saultnau, which is six miles from Péronne. 25 German tanks were destroyed there. The French army has retreated along the Somme River at that point to allow its artillery to repel the German infantry. The Ministry of War continued, "The invading German army used smoke bombs to bombard certain strongholds of the Weygand Line, attempting to sweep away the salient parts of the French army." The Ministry of War acknowledged that German tanks had penetrated five miles into the "Weygand Line" at several points, but said that they were still trying to break through any stronghold of the line. A military figure here stated last night that fierce battles had taken place all day from the lower reaches of the Somme to the Artois River. The main force of the German army was attacking the French forces south of Abbeville, Amiens, and Péronne. (United Press, 7th)

### German Army Successfully Crosses the Somme River; British Army Fights Valiantly at a High Price

Berlin - A German war correspondent participating in the new attack that began on June 5th sent his first report here last night. It stated, "Fierce artillery battles took place when our army crossed the Somme River, destroying the first line of defense held by the French army. Most of the bridges over the Somme River had been destroyed by the French army or bombed by our aircraft in advance. Only one railway bridge remained, which the French army believed was not helpful for tanks and therefore had not been destroyed. When our army attacked, the enemy artillery fire was very dense. Our artillery did not fire back at several points to make the enemy believe that our army had no intention of attacking. At the same time, aircraft provided cover to prevent enemy aircraft from detecting the situation behind our army. At that time, our army was gathering troops from the north. For two nights before the attack, the enemy army bombarded our positions north of the Somme with a barrage of artillery. Our army did not return a single shot. Only after the French artillery fire calmed down did our army begin the attack. Between Amiens and Abbeville, our army stormed the French positions. It was 4:30 a.m. The French army was unprepared. Our army successively crossed the river and engaged in fierce street fighting with the defenders on the other side. Enemy machine guns frantically fired at our army. Our infantry, disregarding their own safety, rushed into the gaps in the enemy positions. Our artillery provided assistance, bombarding the enemy positions across the river from the surrounding mountains. There were landmines buried in the streets, but the enemy retreated in the afternoon of the 5th, and our army immediately occupied the area." (Haitong News Agency, 7th)

London - A military commentator from the Somme front headquarters recounted his eyewitness account of the Highland Regiment of a famous British division fiercely resisting enemy tanks on the Somme River front yesterday. He said, "These troops are part of the British army defending a section of the line near Abbeville. The German army launched a fierce attack across the Somme River on the night of Wednesday. The German army has captured several bridgeheads on the river, leaving several British positions isolated. However, the British army is still fighting valiantly to uphold the glorious reputation of the division. The German invasion has forced the British line to retreat to positions several miles south of the Somme River at several points, but every inch of land has been given up after fierce fighting. This town is no different from an army resisting the German offensive. Among them are people from all walks of life, who were only called into service a year ago, but have now become a strong force. Although they were bombarded by guns and low-flying aircraft, they are in high spirits. After the battle, they shook hands and laughed with each other. The sun was very strong yesterday, and many soldiers took off their clothes to fight. If the British artillery had not bombarded several bridges with 30,000 shells on Wednesday, the German attack might have been even fiercer. Whether the German attack on the Somme River is just a diversionary tactic, attempting to launch a fiercer offensive in a more eastern area strongly defended by the French army, is still unclear. But whatever happens, we are prepared to deal with it." (Reuters, 7th)

### British-French Liaison Officer: Duke of Windsor Resigns

London - It has been learned here that the Duke of Windsor has resigned from his position as a liaison officer between the French and British armies. (Reuters, 7th)

### Air Raid Sirens Sound Frequently in Britain and France; Many Cities Bombed by German Aircraft, Causing Significant Material Damage

Paris - An alarm was issued in Paris early this morning because 200 German aircraft flew over the French front line. The results of the air raid are not yet known. The air raid alarm issued in central France yesterday lasted for three hours before it was lifted. The bombs dropped caused material damage, but no casualties were reported. (Reuters, 7th)

Berlin - Marseille, France's largest port and one of the world's largest port areas, was bombed by the German air force yesterday. The port handles 14 to 15 million tons of cargo annually due to its relationship with the French colonies. For example, Chinese cotton and Japanese silk shipped to France must pass through Marseille. (Haitong, 7th)

London - German aircraft attacked last night, dropping bombs near a town in Lincolnshire and injuring three workers. Alarms were issued in various places when German aircraft flew over the coast, as far as a town in the West Country and a seaside town in the south. Alarms were issued in Suffolk, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Sussex. A red ball was seen in the sky in one place, similar to a plane on fire crashing into the sea. The Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Home Security issued a communiqué at 7:00 a.m. this morning regarding the air raids, stating, "Enemy aircraft flew over our southern coast in many locations last night and then launched continuous attacks over a large area. Before the 'All Clear' signal was issued, the air raid alarm had been lifted. Anti-aircraft guns were firing. Fighter aircraft were ordered to take off and intercept. The enemy aircraft dropped several high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. High-explosive bombs fell in a town in Lincolnshire, slightly injuring two people, but the material damage known so far is minimal. Many bombs were also dropped in the open countryside, and some may have been dropped on airfields." (Reuters, 7th)

### Rumor that Britain will Strictly Control Foreign Exchange

London - Financial circles here claimed last night that strict foreign exchange controls may be implemented immediately. The implementation of this restriction is not to completely abolish free transactions, but to block various loopholes to prevent the division of Britain's gold reserves and US dollar deposits. However, this news has not been confirmed. (United Press, 10th)

(Cheers) "The determination of the British and French governments to restore Belgium's independence and freedom is self-evident." (Reuters, 7th)

### French Morale is Resolute and Vigorous; Belief in Victory is Growing Stronger; The Fate of the World Depends on This Battle; Prime Minister Reynaud Delivers a Broadcast Speech

Paris - Prime Minister Reynaud delivered a broadcast speech this evening, saying, "In the past half month, I have delivered two broadcast speeches. The first was on May 21, when I announced that the German army had arrived in the city of Amiens. The second was on the 28th, to tell the nation that King Leopold had abandoned us, resulting in the Dunkirk port being wide open. Today is the third time. Although the situation is still tense, there are various reasons to be hopeful, and I am happy to tell the nation again. Recently, Germany claimed to be confident in three things, all of which are extremely brutal and cunning: (1) The country's propaganda machine announced that the British and French Allied forces had been surrounded in Belgium and were about to be annihilated and forced to surrender, which would be an unprecedented surrender in history. The morale of the Allied forces would be completely disheartened from then on. However, as proven by the facts, the enemy's steel divisions failed to close the gap, and 325,000 Allied soldiers finally boarded ships and evacuated from Dunkirk. The significance of the British and French control of the ocean can thus be understood by the German side. The morale and public spirit of our country are as resolute and vigorous as those of our predecessors. The heroic events of the Flanders region will also be forever recorded in history. The outstanding achievements of Vice Admiral Abrial, the commander of the northern fleet (who commanded the Dunkirk port operations and the evacuation of the Allied forces), are particularly admired by the world. These great figures are the foundation of France's new life. The glory of the generals of our country's revolution and the naval forces of all generations has also been revived, and it has been made even more brilliant by the thousands of heroic sacrifices for national rights. It is a pity that there may never be a day to recount these heroic events in detail. In short, our country's soldiers may have been caught off guard at the beginning of the war, but later they matched the heroes of 1914. At that time, when the German army arrived in the city of Senlis (45 kilometers northeast of Paris), our heroes also always firmly believed that victory would belong to us. (2) Hitler intended to frustrate the morale of Paris, so on the 3rd of this month, he dispatched hundreds of bombers to carry out a large-scale air raid to scare people. What was its goal? In fact, the result of the bombing was only to cause pain to women, children, and the elderly. Hitler also knew this. Hitler's original intention was to make our national spirit depressed as a result. However, as proven by the facts, the people of Paris were all extraordinarily calm and fearless. We have already learned what the German side calls a large-scale air raid, and the citizens of Paris do not care at all. We have also retaliated. Allied aircraft have flown to bomb Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Essen, Mannheim, Ulm, and Ludwigshafen in Germany. If every city in France is attacked in the future, it will be retaliated in the same way. (3) The third thing that Germany claims to be confident in is the most important, which is the war in France. The enemy army used all kinds of weapons, such as aircraft and armored divisions, to try to break through the French positions. The battle has just begun. Commander-in-Chief General Weygand once told me, "I am very satisfied with the progress of the battle and the implementation of my order to resist the enemy army resolutely at all costs." I can now tell the nation this. In short, our army has been able to adapt to the new form of warfare. Since the start of the war, thousands of enemy tanks have been destroyed. Our army is assisted by Allied aircraft during combat. People all over the world are watching this war intently. The fate of the world will depend on the war of 1940, or, as Hitler said, the fate of the world for hundreds of years to come will depend on this war. In other words, if Hitler wins, a repressive political system will be established inside and outside Europe, and all non-Germans will be reduced to slaves." (Havas, 6th)

### French Cabinet War Meeting; Committee Changed to Eight People

Paris - After the cabinet reshuffle, the cabinet war meeting was also reorganized. The committee was changed from eleven to eight people, namely Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Reynaud, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister without Portfolio General Pétain, Deputy Prime Minister Chautemps, Minister of Armaments Dautry, Minister of Blockade Innes, Minister of the Interior Mandel, Minister without Portfolio Maran, and Ybarnégaray.

### Thorough Reorganization of the British Cabinet Expected: Initial Wartime Setbacks Make the Old Guard Accountable

London - According to well-informed sources here, after the House of Commons holds a closed-door meeting on the 11th of this month, the British cabinet will be reorganized. It is expected that the "old guard ministers," such as Lord President Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood, Lord Chancellor Simon, and Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security Anderson, will all retire. Simultaneously, major changes will occur in various government agencies. The entire nation feels the gravity of the current situation, unseen in British history. This is attributed to the inadequate preparations made in all aspects at the beginning of the current European war. All those responsible for this should step down to appease the nation. Although the previous cabinet reshuffle considered military, economic, and spiritual aspects, it was not thorough enough. Therefore, this subsequent reorganization should be a "revolutionary move," expected to be finalized within the next week. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### British Air Force Cooperates in Battle: Heavy Bombardment of German Tank Columns, Fires Erupt in Hamburg Oil Depots

London - Yesterday, the British Air Force bombed German forces attempting to penetrate the Allied defense lines at Abbeville. In the morning, heavy bombs and numerous smaller bombs were dropped on German armored columns. In the afternoon, British medium bomber squadrons maintained a continuous bombardment for forty-five minutes, directly hitting road bridges and communication lines. At dusk, British aircraft again targeted key bridges at the Somme estuary, directly hitting one important bridge with three heavy bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

London - The British Air Ministry announced that yesterday and the day before, Royal Air Force heavy and medium bombers were dispatched around the clock, continuously harassing the second German offensive in France, repeatedly attacking massed mechanized units and German lines of communication. Two transport truck convoys were hit, and one military train was derailed. Key road and rail locations were bombed and rendered temporarily unusable. In addition, oil refineries and parking lots near the Ruhr and Hamburg were also bombed. Medium bombers attacking between Amiens and Calais were intercepted by enemy fighters, often shooting down two enemy aircraft, which caught fire and crashed. British aircraft also flew over Cambrai, dropping bombs that hit a railway parking lot, destroying hundreds of yards of track. The enemy-occupied Cambrai airfield was also bombed. Enemy troops at Le Cateu were heavily bombed, destroying a train. Saint-Quentin and Douai were also attacked. A major British oil storage depot was bombed, causing extensive fires in the surrounding area. Fires also spread along the Kiel Canal and the Scheldt River, and the Hiesch Canal and other areas were also attacked. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### Dutch East Indies: Raw Materials and Ships, Dutch Government Considers Providing for Allied Use

London - Reuters learned from well-informed Dutch sources in London that "the Dutch government is now considering two important economic matters: providing raw materials from the Dutch East Indies to the Allies and providing ships for Allied use. The supply of raw materials will be limited so as not to hinder exports to the United States and Japan. As for providing Dutch ships for Allied use, it is under consideration, but sufficient tonnage must be left to transport goods to the United States, Australia, Japan, and South Africa."

Gayda Criticizes the United States

Rome - The famous Italian journalist Gayda published an article in "Italian News" yesterday, stating that regarding the possibility of Western European countries forming an alliance with the United States, Italians should remain absolutely calm. American interference in favor of Western countries began at the start of the war and has gradually become more pronounced, with the possibility of even greater activity in the future. However, this is still insufficient to affect the European war situation. The greater the loss of territory, defense lines, fortresses, soldiers, and industrial centers of Western countries, the more difficult it will be for overseas allies to assist the two countries in resisting. If American interference becomes more active, the interests of Germany and Italy will become clearer. We cannot believe that the United States must save the Old World. The point is that Britain and France cannot represent the whole of Europe. The population of Britain and France is only 90 million. If the United States favors Britain and France and interferes in Europe, is it not supporting a small part of Europe and restraining the majority? In other words, it is supporting one system against another. The United States has always regarded the Monroe Doctrine as the basic principle of its foreign policy. If the United States arbitrarily interferes in matters related to Europe itself, it will give European countries the right to take countermeasures. This is very clear. Therefore, if the United States can favor one European country and oppose another, then one day European countries can also favor one American country and oppose the United States, because the United States has now created this precedent. Furthermore, American interference in the European war violates its Monroe Doctrine, and the United States has no right to judge European disputes. The United States can be a country, but it has no sacred mission to judge the fate of other countries. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)

Postponement of Italian Premier's Speech

London - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's "decisive" speech, originally scheduled for last night, has been postponed. Diplomatic figures here have commented on this, saying that the reason is twofold: (1) If Germany's new offensive in France succeeds, Italy will step forward as an intermediary between France and Germany to restore peace, but only if France makes significant concessions to Italy; (2) If the German offensive fails, Italy will wait and see how the situation develops and act accordingly. As for the position of US President Roosevelt, it can be summarized in one sentence: even if he cannot make Italy's attitude more amenable, he can at least delay matters. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### United States Prepares to Implement Conservative Embargo: Allies to Receive Sufficient Supplies, Hull Indicates Far East Policy Unchanged

Washington - A reporter learned today that President Roosevelt's new National Defense Committee has asked industrialists to adopt a voluntary "conservative embargo," refusing to sell military supplies to any country other than the Allies. This is the first official measure taken by the committee. According to officials, although this method is not currently compulsory, exporters have already begun to cooperate with the government even before Congress authorizes the President to ban the export of goods deemed necessary for defense. According to authoritative sources, this new policy has disrupted the United States' foreign trade, and countries participating in the US reciprocal trade program are deeply concerned, as merchants have guaranteed to all countries that they can purchase goods from the US without restriction, even in times of emergency or war. It is reported that these contracting countries have received notification that due to the European crisis, the United States must preserve all its military supplies to facilitate its own and the Allied military programs. Once the European situation clears, this restriction can be lifted. It is rumored that 40,000 US exporters have been formally notified, but officials deny this, saying that the new policy has been secretly communicated to major exporters, so most exporters understand this need and are holding back on export contracts. As a result of the implementation of this new policy, the number of military aircraft exported from the US to China, Latin America, and the Dutch East Indies is now close to zero, and negotiations for Italy to purchase 200,000 tons of scrap metal from the US have been aborted. It is also reported that a large number of machines waiting in San Francisco to be shipped to Japan have been requisitioned by the army, and that all US machine factories have received orders to retain all export orders for government requisition. The National Defense Conference will meet again today to discuss how to plan the rapid mobilization of the industrial sector to make up for the losses of the Allies in the Flanders campaign. (International News Service dispatch, 7th)

Washington - Reuters learned from well-informed sources here that the US government's policy towards the Far East has not changed and does not seem to be under consideration. The various rumors that have been circulating recently are not credible. The US government still adheres to the policy it adopted when it announced the abrogation of the US-Japan commercial treaty. The authorities' attitude remains that the treaty was abrogated because of Japan's actions in China, and Japan's subsequent actions have not provided any reason to change US policy. When Secretary of State Hull recently received journalists, someone asked whether the US and Japan were currently holding negotiations or talks to negotiate a new treaty. Hull always replied that the situation had not changed and there was no sign of change. The US government has used public fears about its own defense to allow Congress to safely pass a clause. If the text openly stated that this was due to the situation in the Far East, some tremors would inevitably occur among isolationists. It is now believed that this clause was drafted by the Department of the Army and the Department of State, with particular attention to Japan. The first action taken by the US government under this clause was to announce a ban on the export of machine tools. The Japanese arms industry previously relied on Germany to supply these items, but since the source from Germany has been cut off, it has relied entirely on the United States, which it will now also lose. The State Department's attitude towards the Dutch East Indies is absolutely firm. Public concern about the country's defense has greatly contributed to this firmness. The entire nation now holds a sincere desire, worrying that its defenses are not fully consolidated, so the authorities, Congress, and newspapers all regard preserving the supply of rubber and tin from Malaya and the Dutch East Indies as the most important part of American foreign policy. Political observers now believe that if Japan does not exercise prudence in its plans and takes serious action against the Dutch East Indies, the United States will immediately rise up to stop it. This view is now everywhere. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### Balkan Entente Economic Conference

Capital of Yugoslavia - The Standing Economic Conference of the Balkan Entente countries is currently being held here to discuss the distribution of raw materials. The Yugoslav delegation has submitted a proposal advocating the establishment of a central organization to be responsible for handling the distribution of raw materials in the Balkan Peninsula countries and purchasing various raw materials, especially cotton, rubber, and coffee, according to the group purchase method. The representatives of Turkey and Romania seem to agree with this proposal, but the representative of Greece does not. It is generally believed that this is due to pressure from Italy, as the German and Italian consortia will try to obstruct any comprehensive attempt by the Balkan Entente countries to cooperate.

### Soviet Pravda Comments on Italy's Entry into the War: Military and Economic Preparations Insufficient, Attempts to Use the Situation to Serve as an International Broker

Moscow - Regarding the issue of Italy's entry into the war, Pravda commented: "Italy is not fully prepared economically and militarily, which has prevented the Italian side from demonstrating its activity in the current international events. The Italian side's wavering attitude is due to the fact that the country's authorities are trying to profit from the current situation, but so far, the benefits that the Italian side has obtained are not as great as it expected. Therefore, the Italian newspapers are issuing strong threats to Britain and France, saying that Italy will use submarines and air forces to turn the Mediterranean Sea into a 'trap' for the Allied fleet." However, the author of the article "Report on Foreign Policy" believes that the Italian newspapers' clamor does not mean that Italy will soon enter the war. He says that Italy will preserve its strength, and once the belligerent countries are exhausted, it will propose conditions or even assume the role of an international broker. (TASS dispatch, 6th)

### The Chorus of "Neutrality" at the Outbreak of the European War (2)

— Shudi

(2) Romania's "Neutrality" (September 17, London)

Earlier, I mentioned that considering only the countries of the Balkan Peninsula (excluding Poland), the military strength that could be mobilized was estimated to be roughly six million people!

However, just as German troops were concentrating on the Polish border, Britain and France had already fully mobilized, and war was imminent, King Carol of Romania suddenly delivered an ultimatum to the Polish government, stating that it would not interfere in the German-Polish conflict; at the same time, it announced to the world that it had decided to "strictly maintain neutrality" in this war.

This sudden move by King Carol was, to some extent, unexpected by most observers. Its greatest fundamental reason, without a doubt, was due to the pressure from Italy. The night before Hitler set off to the front line to supervise the troops, he broadcast in Berlin, "We do not need Italy to join the war now." Italy had long accepted Germany's opinion, in order to fulfill its mission of suppressing the Balkan Peninsula for Germany and to serve as an import and export route, Italy had preemptively indicated "neutrality."

This time, the Italian boot had stepped on the entire Balkan Peninsula in the Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Black Seas; naturally, it had also stepped on Romania.

Ultimately going to war was a great success in British and French diplomacy; here, we must acknowledge that Romania's ultimate decision not to join was, with the same certainty, a failure of British and French diplomacy.

On the eve of the outbreak of the invasion of Poland, the British and French diplomatic representatives formally notified the Romanian government of two things: one was to tell it that if Germany invaded Poland, Britain and France had decided to immediately join the battle; the other was to hope that it would also participate in the Polish campaign. At the same time, the Polish government was also in contact with Romania to organize a united front of Southeast European countries against Germany. If Romania had truly accepted the proposal to participate in the war, then it is clear that the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, surrounded by Poland, Turkey, and other countries, would have had a very high chance of immediately organizing a united front against Germany.

Wuxi Correspondence: Wuxi is the center of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. The mobile units of the Chinese forces in the four rural districts appear and disappear unpredictably. The most recent situation is as follows: In the four districts of Jingyun, Nanyan, Beishang, and Beibu in the eastern countryside, Nanyan borders Wuxian to the east, and Beishang borders Changshu to the north. Jingyun runs through the railway, and Beibu slightly follows the highway. There are many Chinese mobile troops in Beibu and Tianxia Township. The Japanese army has forced the restoration of land and water transportation in Tangkou Town and stationed a small number of Japanese troops there, establishing a puppet township office. In Ganlu Town, north of the town, there are stationed Chinese troops. A few days ago, the Chinese troops there opened fire with the puppet pacification force in Huangdai, Wuxian. The highway north of Houqiao Town is damaged. The small towns of Dongqiao and Rangqiao, subordinate to it to the south, are stationed with Chinese troops. Because they are far from the city, in the western border area bordering Beibu, New Fourth Army mobile units appear and disappear near Songshan. Beibu's Dongting Town, Chajiaqiao, and Meicun Hebei have always been strongholds of the Chinese army. After the Japanese occupied Dongting and Meicun, they forced the people to build a highway between Anzhen and Meicun to prevent sudden attacks by the Chinese. In the four districts of Huaishang, Huaixia, Tianshang, and Tianxia in the northern countryside, Huaishang and Tianxia, bordering Jiangyin to the north, are influenced by the Chinese Patriotic Salvation Army of Chengxian County. The Japanese army sent troops to Zhangjingqiao. Bashiqiao has been repeatedly burned by the Japanese army, and the local vitality is exhausted. Now, the Japanese army is planning to build a road from north of Zhangjingqiao to Chenshu and south to the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway. Japanese troops are stationed in Yangjian Yanjiaqiao, specializing in guarding the Changshu-Wuxi Highway. The Yanqiao Xicheng Highway runs through the north and south and has always been a spot where Chinese mobile troops appear and disappear. Those with a little prestige in the area have all left and not returned. The puppet regime wants to form a puppet township office, but it is difficult to establish it. In the four rural districts of Kaihua, Xin'an, Yangming, and Taibo in the southern countryside, they border Taihu Lake to the south and Wuxian to the east. There is the Suzhou-Wuxi Highway on land and the canal by water. In places such as Nanfangquan, Gedaiqiao, Fangqiao, Banqiao, Zhoutanqiao, Xushe, Shitang, and Wutang, puppet troops are stationed. In the northwest area, Chinese mobile troops are stationed. In Xin'an Liqiao, Luoxiaqiao, Xuntangqiao, Zhoutanqiao, etc., Chinese troops often conduct mobile searches. Yangming Township has suffered severe disasters. Japanese naval troops are stationed in the west of the town, and puppet troops are stationed in Nanqiao. They previously opened fire with the Chinese army and set up tax checkpoints to extort donations from merchants and travelers. The area around Houzhai Daqiangdou is still considered stable. In the four districts of Kaiyuan, Fu'an, Qingcheng, and Wan'an in the western countryside, they border Wujin to the west and Taihu Lake to the south. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Wuxi-Yixing Highway run through the middle. The entire territory of Kaiyuan, with Hui Mountain running through the center, borders Taihu Lake in the south and the canal in the north. In places such as Outangqiao Qianqiao, Xuxiang south of the mountain, Rongxiang, and Heliekou, there are Japanese troops. Xin Duqiao and Yangshan are very far from the city, and the New Fourth Army is very active in the area bordering Wujin. The original transportation has been controlled. Towns such as Dongqianzhou and Beiqifang border Jiangyin to the northwest. The Chinese army has been holding it for a long time, and the Japanese puppets dare not go there. In Mengli, Luoshe, Yangshuyuan, and other places, they are close to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Except for a small team of Japanese troops in Mengli, the other towns dare not go because they fear the Chinese army. In summary, the Chinese forces in the four rural districts are mostly waiting for the enemy at their ease. Japanese troops are stationed in the area, or puppet troops pretend to be Japanese. They dare not take a step beyond the boundaries in the townships and villages. And the farmers' belief in the victory of the War of Resistance is still very firm.

In the 120-yard high hurdles, Li Zhenzhong of Chinese United hopes to win again.

As for the total score, the Western Police have the best chance of winning the championship, and Chinese United is expected to compete with Western Youth for the second place. However, high jump star Wu Bixian will not be able to participate today due to working at the customs, which will be a great loss to the team.

### Massive Shipment of British and French Gold to the US; British-American Exchange Rate Rises by Over Four Jiao; It is Said that the US Will Ban Speculation in British Pounds; Others Say it is the First Sign of US Dollar Devaluation

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed price was unchanged. In the black market for British-American exchange rates, the British and American exchange rates went in opposite directions due to Yi Yin's exchange rate jumping by four jiao and nine fen one two five. The reason for the rise in exchange rates is that the massive shipment of British and French gold to the US has caused speculators to make nervous guesses. Some say that there will be major progress in British finance, others say that the US will ban speculation and control the free rise and fall of exchange rates, which has aroused the compensation of British pound bears, and still others say that it is the first sign of US dollar devaluation, causing the market to open tight for British and loose for American. Later, there was a prediction that the exchange rate would fall back by a small amount of two jiao, and Chinese merchants rushed to buy, and banks sold less for a time. Therefore, the US dollar exchange rate once returned from the opening price of 5.75 yuan to a tight price of 5.40625 yuan, and the shilling continued to soften to three-ben shi eight one two five. Tianjin merchants came to sell British exchange, Hong Kong telegrams and Sassoon sold US dollars heavily in this city, and a certain American bank also sold. Speculators also changed to buying, which caused a violent loosening trend, and the US dollar reached 5.6875 yuan, and the shilling also returned to three-ben shi nine zero six two five. In the afternoon, there was news that the Tianjin silver case with Japan had been resolved and signed. Banks had a slightly better appetite, and Chinese merchants came back to buy, so there was a rebound. Finally, the shilling was three-ben shi eight seven five, and the US dollar was 5.59375 yuan. The British exchange rate was tight by one two five, and the US dollar was reversed by two eight one two five. The transaction was very prosperous throughout the day, but people's minds were very unstable.

Shorts Buy on the Cheap

In the early morning, the price of large bars in London rose by nearly six two five, quickly rising by four three seven five. The price of silver in New York was flat. The exchange rate of raw gold in London was fixed. The exchange rate of British to American was unchanged, and the exchange rate to Shanghai was long by zero three one two five. The exchange rate to France was unchanged, the exchange rate of American to British rose sharply by four jiao and nine fen one two five, the exchange rate to Shanghai was up five jiao, and the exchange rate to France rose by two jiao and seven fen seven five. The listed exchange rates of the Central Bank remained the same. The opening selling price of spot exchange rates in the morning was three-ben shi eight seven five for British gold and 5.75 yuan for US exchange, which was one two five less than yesterday's closing for British exchange and the US exchange rate was reversed by four three seven five, which was caused by drastic changes in exchange rates. However, the market situation after the opening was extremely chaotic, with some banks not offering prices. It was not until the HSBC listed price was announced and all exchange rates were unchanged that the official market price appeared at 9:38, with a balance tax of 3.25% added to silver. British gold was three-ben shi eight four three seven five, and US exchange was 5.625 yuan. Later, Chinese merchants and speculators compensated, and the potential was tight. It is estimated that foreign and American banks have absorbed US exchange for June at 5.5625 yuan and half of the month, and the opening price for July is 5.3125 and two five. The tightest price for spot US exchange has been reported to be 5.46875 yuan, and British gold is three-ben shi eight one two five. Then Tianjin merchants suddenly came to sell, and Hong Kong telegrams and Sassoon all sold. The market turned hard, and foreign banks took over British exchange from Tianjin merchants in June at three-ben shi eight seven five. In the same month, US exchange from Hong Kong telegrams and Sassoon was sold to foreign banks at 5.625 yuan, and the US exchange from foreign banks to Hong Kong telegrams in July was priced at 5.4375 yuan. Near noon, the market was still loose. Maccari sold American gold to American banks in June at three-ben shi nine zero six two five, and American banks did business with foreign banks for spot US exchange at 5.6875 yuan. As a result, British gold closed at three-ben shi nine zero six two five, and US exchange closed at 5.65625 yuan, slightly longer than the morning opening price for spot British exchange at zero three one two five, and the US exchange rebounded by zero nine three seven five.

The Market is Tight for British and Loose for American

The market situation was quieter in the afternoon, and prices were also calm. The Japanese bank came to sell to American banks spot US exchange at 5.625 yuan. Later, speculators also sold American gold to foreign banks in June for 5.59375 yuan. By the time of closing, speculators came to buy foreign gold in the same month for 5.5625 yuan. As a result of the closing, British gold was three-ben shi eight seven five, and US exchange was 5.59375 yuan. The prices for June were the same as this month. The prices for British gold in July were three-ben shi seven five, and the prices for US exchange were 5.375 yuan, which was one two five less than the closing price on the previous day for both spot and forward British gold, and the price for spot US exchange was reversed by eight one two five, while the prices for forward exchange were hard by three one two five.

Hong Kong US Exchange Rises Sharply

Hong Kong, 7th (Friday) Telegram: This morning, the Hong Kong market opened with volatility due to the sharp loosening of American and British exchange rates.

### American Exchange Rate Drops Sharply, Cash Reaches a Shocking Low of 5,680 Yuan

Yesterday, cash in the black market plummeted unexpectedly. It once dropped to 5,680 yuan due to the sharp rise of over 4.9 jiao in the British and American exchange rates. There were concerns that the US dollar might devalue, or rumors that the US government would control the free rise and fall of exchange rates and crack down on speculation. Furthermore, due to the unfavorable situation for the Allied forces in the European war, Britain and France had transported gold to the US, leading to tight foreign exchange in Britain and easing in the US. This triggered many to settle their positions. The opening price was 5,900 yuan, a drop of 200 yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, due to buying by gold shops and retail investors, it briefly rebounded by 100 yuan. However, after foreign exchange rates uniformly strengthened, sellers gathered, and under the pressure of massive selling, it closed at a low price of 5,680 yuan. In the afternoon, the market sentiment slightly improved. It initially opened at 5,720 yuan. Later, there were reports of a resolution to the Sino-Japanese issue in Tianjin, and it was further boosted by buying from gold shops and securities firms, pushing it up to 5,850 yuan. Before the evening session, money exchangers came to settle, pushing it back down to 5,730 yuan. The closing result was 5,795 yuan, a huge drop of 305 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading volume for the whole day was still strong, approximately 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry shops ultimately posted a decrease of 40 yuan, while customs gold and others remained unchanged.

Cash Gold Plunges by Over 300 Yuan

Since the morning, the price per bar (ten taels) initially showed surprising volatility because of the surge in exchange rates and the extreme easing of the American exchange rate. Although people were highly alarmed, they initially remained calm. The morning opening was at 6,200 yuan, with gold shops selling to silver shops 50 taels at 5,900 yuan. Moreover, at that time, sentiment was improving, and the exchange rate market was also tight. Under the influence of gold shops' ability to buoy prices, it strongly rebounded by 100 yuan, with silver shops selling to gold shops ten taels at 6,000 yuan. Later, due to sales by jewelry shops, securities firms, and retail investors, the price weakened. Gold shops sold to silver shops and money exchangers a total of twenty taels at 5,830 yuan. Subsequently, another gold shop bought in, and the price rose again, with gold and silver shops selling to money exchangers a total of three taels at 5,970 yuan. Unexpectedly, selling pressure suddenly arose at noon, with jewelry shops competing to sell, and a lack of support on the trading floor. This resulted in a sharp drop of 290 yuan, with silver shops selling to money exchangers twenty taels at 5,680 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, sentiment improved, and gold shops began buying, pushing up the price by 40 yuan, with gold shops doing business with each other for ten taels at 5,720 yuan. Later, due to large-scale searches by securities firms and reports of a certain agreement signed between Britain and Japan regarding the Tianjin situation, buying sentiment was extremely strong, pushing up the price by 130 yuan, with gold shops selling to securities firms ten taels at 5,850 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange rate market ultimately hardened, and retail investors, unable to withstand the pressure, gave way, and the price dropped back down by 120 yuan, with money exchangers selling to securities firms twenty taels at 5,735 yuan. Before the close, a certain securities firm added to their long positions, raising the price by 75 yuan, with securities firms buying from gold shops ten taels at 5,805 yuan. As a result, another securities firm sold, and the closing price retreated slightly, with another securities firm selling to gold shops ten taels at 5,795 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session, a drop of 305 yuan compared to the previous day. The range for the whole day was 320 yuan. The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand was more than ten yuan higher than that of cash gold, while the buying price was reduced by thirty yuan. The current standard gold was quoted more than fifty yuan lower than the listed price, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Drops by Forty Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael by major jewelry shops initially remained at six hundred and sixty yuan. At 8:30, it was reduced by twenty yuan, at 9:55 it was further reduced by ten yuan, at 10:20 it rebounded by ten yuan, at 10:30 it dropped again by ten yuan, at 11:00 it dropped again by ten yuan, at 12:00 it dropped again by ten yuan, and at 3:00 in the afternoon it rebounded by ten yuan. As a result, major jewelry shops revised the price to 590 yuan. New jewelry shops had the same price as the earlier price, and buying prices were reduced by approximately thirty yuan.

### Rumors of Devaluation Cause a Sharp Drop in American Dollar Notes

The foreign currency market situation that day saw a sudden surge in the decline of cash gold, leading to abundant supply of British and American gold pounds. Market prices uniformly plummeted by seven yuan. British and American gold notes saw the pound price rise sharply by more than 4.9 jiao. Therefore, the trends differed. The former rose by one yuan, while the latter, coupled with rumors that the American dollar was about to devalue, fell by eight jiao. Hong Kong notes fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon. Annam and Philippine notes were slightly supplied, and market prices uniformly weakened. The supply and demand for Japanese gold coins were balanced, and the evening market price remained at one yuan, one jiao, and three fen. There was slightly demand for Korean notes, and the market price rose slightly, with the evening market price being nine jiao, four fen, and five li.

### Discount Rate Enters the 100 Yuan Threshold

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange-denominated bills of exchange continued to fall. For every 1,000 yuan, the discount rate fell from 105 yuan in the morning to only 92 yuan to 102.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it remained stable, a decrease of five yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was quoted at 2.5 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of one fen.

### Securities Drawing Approaching, Class E Rises More Significantly

Yesterday's trend in the securities black market was quite good. As the final day for Class E lottery drawing approached, there was closing of short positions, and the rise was greater. Class C rose again by fifty yuan, and Class D also approached nine yuan. The environment and news remained vaguely shimmering. The goodness of government bonds was partly due to the gradual approach of the ninth-period interest, with short sellers being somewhat apprehensive, and partly due to the decline in gold prices. Whether or not the future prospects of the lottery rights would continue depended on the tightness or looseness of credit. Yesterday morning, Zhen Da, Da Le, Mao Feng, Chang and others actually bought, while Heng Lian, Heng Fu, Tong Po, Lian He and others sold. Class C initially opened at 50.03 yuan, and the result was a sideways market around the 50 yuan mark. Other types were quite firm.

### Yarn Market Deteriorates Daily, Japanese Yarn Drops Sharply, Double Horse Plummets by 100 Yuan

The yarn market is very weak, and the decline is severe. This is because the American exchange rate eased, and gold prices plummeted, which greatly dampened sentiment. Speculative long positions were being settled, which caused the market to be unable to support itself, and the market price declined sharply. However, demand in South China is still relatively strong, but it is difficult to reverse the downward trend. In reality, the environment cannot be overcome. It is said that after the close, 20-count Double Horse yarn was traded at 1,145 yuan, which is more than five yuan lower than the low price on the 16th of last month.

The morning opening for current yarn was influenced by the exchange rate and the very low selling price of Japanese yarn. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,240 yuan, rising slightly to 1,245 yuan. Later, upon hearing that gold prices were falling, selling pressure in the market intensified, and it fell directly to 1,200 yuan. At this time, those who had profited covered their positions, and the price rose again to 1,224 yuan. By the time of the close, because foreign exchange continued to ease and sentiment was even more weak, it broke through the 200 yuan mark, closing at 1,175 yuan. It was found that the turnover for half a day was 1,370 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 99 yuan. In addition, 570 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each group is listed as follows:

Same Trade 780, Hong Kong 490, Total 1,370

### Coarse and Fine Cotton May Fall in Price, Local Market Trading is Quiet

Cotton trading in this market is unusually quiet, and sentiment is mixed. Some say that coarse cotton will fall by 40 yuan, but according to cotton brokers, the strong price is likely a temporary rebound. Recently, the prices on the market have been slightly uneven. The only transaction was one lot of 100 bales of middling cotton by a trader, at a price of 285 yuan, delivered at the pier. In short, because the yarn market has plummeted, the price of cotton is also in a whirlpool.

Another report states that the market prices for foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, initially fell due to selling pressure, but then rallied due to the sudden easing of the Central American exchange rate and purchases by some traders. As a result, the closing market situation was firm, rising by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. India's situation yesterday, including forecasts, was relatively stable.

Yesterday's trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai was quiet because the British and American exchange rates rose suddenly. The American exchange rate rose, and the British pound weakened, so the equivalent cotton price was lower for American cotton and higher for Indian cotton. There were no transactions for even one bale throughout the day. All parties held a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a dead market. The following are the futures factory prices converted at an American exchange rate of 5.5 yuan per dollar:

20-count American Middling 298.90

Also, the lower grade 287.50

32-count also 319.90

Also, the lower grade 308.70

42-count also 325.60

Also, the lower grade 316.00

### Tap Water Has a Strong Odor, Sales of Hypochlorous Acid Increase

Recently, the tap water has had a strong medicinal odor that lasts for a long time. Moreover, when making tea, it is particularly noticeable. It is said that the water source is turbid, and to kill bacteria, more ammonia and alum-like substances must be added for sedimentation and sterilization. As a result, congee, rice, vegetables, and beverages all have a strong medicinal smell. Sales of both substances have been brisk in the market.

### Rice Market, Speculative Merchants Dump Foreign Rice, Tight Credit Due to Approaching Dragon Boat Festival

Yesterday's rice market was similar to the previous day, with an initial weakening followed by tightening, but there was no significant gain or loss. Because the festival is imminent and credit is tight, those who were in urgent need of credit in the morning sought to sell quickly. However, the sales market continued to wait and see, which made the situation weak at that time. After hearing the news of falling gold prices and rising exchange rates, people became even more apprehensive. Not only did the original wholesale merchants throw everything away, but speculative merchants also competed to sell at lower prices. For a time, prices fell rapidly. By mid-morning, No. 1 Chen Saigon was only selling for 53.5 yuan, No. 2 for 51.5 yuan, fire-cooked rice for 52.5 yuan, No. 2 Siam for around 50 yuan, and small-cooked rice for 50 yuan. Moreover, current shipments were even cheaper, and prices were entering the 50 yuan mark, with some selling for as low as 49.7 yuan. However, after this sell-off, some began to buy at the lower prices, and the market gradually stabilized and showed a sideways trend. The situation remained unchanged. Near closing time, the Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo merchants from the mainland suddenly made large-scale purchases, and local shopkeepers also needed to replenish their stocks for the festival. Seeing that the situation had stabilized, they also competed to buy, and the sales market immediately became lively. With many inquiries, sellers' prices rose, and the closing market price was set.

Yesterday, foreign rice weakened in the morning and then rose, only to fall again in the afternoon, influenced by the fluctuations in foreign exchange, the continuing stability of foreign rice prices, and the movements of local merchants and speculative merchants. After the morning opening, prices fell by nearly one yuan, then rose by about one yuan. In the afternoon, they fell again by half a yuan. Although the overall change for the day was only 3-5 jiao, the closing situation was very weak. In addition to rumors of a continuing stability in foreign rice prices, the market also announced the sale of 500 tons of Siam tea rice at 56 yuan, which was one yuan lower than the previous week. Second-grade Siam rice for delivery was offered at 59.4 yuan in the morning and fell to 59.2 yuan in the afternoon, also for 50 tons. It was reported that the counter-offer had also fallen to 59.5 yuan, but foreign firms were still quoting above 60 yuan. The results for the whole day were 54.5 yuan to 54 yuan for No. 1 Chen Saigon, 52.5 yuan to 52 yuan for No. 2, 54.5 yuan to 54 yuan for No. 1 Siam, 52 yuan to 51.8 yuan for No. 2, 53.5 yuan to 53 yuan for fire-cooked rice, 51 yuan to 50 yuan and 5 jiao for small-cooked rice, 50 yuan and 5 jiao to 50 yuan for Tokyo polished rice, 46.5 yuan for broken rice, and 48.5 yuan to 48 yuan for tea rice. It was found that the entire market had a range of one yuan up and down.

There was still a small amount of domestic glutinous rice arriving, and sales were sluggish. Both open and secret market rumors indicated that sales were weak due to the approaching festival. Therefore, prices remained unchanged. Changbang special-grade clean glutinous rice was 58-59 yuan, Chang Kun glutinous rice was 57-58 yuan, old-crop rice was around 56 yuan, Nankang early rice was 56 yuan, old-crop rice was 55.5 yuan, thin rice was scarce and there was no market, Jinli special-grade Yuan rice was 46-47 yuan, Changdan white Yuan rice was 45-46 yuan, and Jiangbei white Yuan rice was 43-44 yuan.

### Limited Supply of Flour

The flour trade remained normal yesterday. In addition to retail sales on this street, the Nanyang merchants were slightly active. However, even at a high price of 16 yuan, factories were unwilling to supply large quantities to the merchants. On this street, the original price was maintained, and there was an invisible limit. Apart from supplying to customers for daily needs, other buyers were not accepted. Therefore, the total market sold directly by the factories was no more than 5,000 bags. The quoted price for returned old-brand trucks was 14 yuan, but there were no official transactions. Domestic flour reserves had been depleted, and sources were unavailable. The situation remained tight.

Wheat, New wheat has not yet officially appeared on the market yesterday. Occasionally, Japanese merchants transported a small number to Shanghai, but it was difficult to confirm. Chinese factories and grain merchants are still discussing the issue of contacting and transporting wheat.

### Miscellaneous Grains, Difficult to Transport New Broad Beans

There was a slightly larger supply of new broad beans, but sales were sluggish, and the market was weak. However, it is currently difficult to transport them, and costs are high. Merchants are unwilling to sell cheaply. Moreover, the weather has been dry recently, and the quality of the beans is dry and clean, making them suitable for long storage. Furthermore, rice prices are difficult to ease, and the villagers also know how to store this type of coarse grain. As the market weakens, the supply is likely to be limited. Those with the means are also hoarding them. There are currently no fewer than 2-3,000 bags of green and white beans stored, and there is a potential for tightening. Recently, there have only been trades of ten or eight bags. Market prices are chaotic. Yesterday, the price of green beans from North Port was still 19 yuan, while green beans from Minhang (actually from Pudong) were 18.6 yuan. It was said that they were all in old hemp sacks. A total of over 160 bags were traded. White broad beans from Jiading were 16.7 yuan, with 200 bags traded. Sales were still limited to retail sales on this street. It is said that they are being hoarded. Today, 520 pieces of beans were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Cotton Cloth Market Fluctuations, Cloth Prices Drop Straight Down

Domestic Cloth: The cloth market fell rapidly, and the selling prices uniformly went down, due to fluctuations in the exchange market, the speculation that the US dollar would devalue and the price of yarn fell sharply, which caused increasing panic. Buyers were less inclined to purchase, so the sales were few. The sale price was unsubstantiated, while the actual transaction prices were very different. Quoted prices fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Merchants on this street and out-of-town merchants purchased small amounts of needed goods, and the trend of hoarding decreased. White twill flannel was available. Da Wei Factory's Yu Feng brand 16-pound cloth was 53 yuan, 13.5-pound cloth was 45 yuan. Nantong Dasheng Factory's Lei Che brand 14-pound cloth was 48 yuan, 13-pound cloth was 45 yuan, and 9-pound cloth was 35 yuan. The wholesale stores on this street offered more than 200 pieces of futures for July, August, and September.

Car Cloth: The downward trend continued sharply, and the price of white goods and fine cloth dropped again by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan (per piece). Dragon Head fine cloth was displayed in the market at 38.4 to 38.5 yuan, and by the noon closing, it rebounded to 38.8 yuan. The momentum weakened in the aftermarket, and the selling trend intensified, falling to 38.3 to 38.4 yuan. The lowest price for Four Gentlemen drill was shouted out at 1 yuan per yard, and the closing price was 1 yuan and 5 fen.

Exports: Today, 150 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Coal, Large Quantities of Soft Coal Arrive

The price of soft coal had been slightly rising because of the shrinking exchange rate, but the ordered goods continued to arrive one after another. Yesterday, one merchant had arrived over 7,000 tons of Indian Kolkata soft coal that was warehoused in Pudong Hongsheng Stack and has already been unloaded. As a result, people are stable and the market plate's coloration is limited. It is heard that the goods that are scheduled to arrive this month are as much as 20,000 tons.

### Dried and Fresh Goods, Pickled Mustard Tuber Transport Costs are Extremely High

The new crop of Sichuan pickled mustard tubers have been harvested early but transportation costs are unusually high. Freight costs alone per picul are as much as 160 yuan, so nobody dared to try. No new products have arrived in this city yet but sporadic lots of new products that transited through Ningbo from the domestic areas have been shipped here. New products on the market are selling for 160 to 170 yuan. Although new goods can also be transshipped through Ningbo, it is extremely slow and will take two months to arrive.

### Sugar Market, Brown Sugar Rises Slightly by 5 Jiao

The sugar market was flat yesterday. No. 24 coarse white sugar was 71.2 yuan at the central warehouse, and 70 yuan to 71 yuan at external warehouses, later 70.5 yuan. Transit goods were soft at first but then tight at 56 yuan to 56.5 yuan, tightening to 57.2 to 57 yuan, closing at 56.8 yuan, up slightly 7 jiao. Taikoo Crystal White was not on offer. The asking price rose 5 jiao to 83 yuan. Dutch brown sugar rose 5 jiao to 61 yuan.

### Hardware, Bamboo Steel Bars Sales are Sluggish, Local Nail Market is also Depressed

The recent trading of bamboo steel bars has been weak, as construction businesses on this street rarely purchase and merchants from other ports rarely stop by. The standard selling price has entered a state of decline given that the gold price plummeted and foreign exchange eased yesterday. Inspected, there was very little trading in the market yesterday, just a few sporadic orders. The asking price was 3 to 4 fen, and each ton sold for about 1,450 yuan, over 5 fen sold for about 1,400 yuan.

The local factory's nails market has become depressed since Tianjin merchants were unable to purchase. Furthermore, the needs of construction businesses in this area are limited, and the factory's output has not decreased. The market has abundant product, so supply exceeds demand and the market price has gradually decreased. Each barrel of nails is only 67-68 yuan, and sales are very sluggish. Inspected, there were only about 100 barrels sold in the market yesterday.

Also, 5,695 pieces of iron hoops arrived from Tianjin yesterday.

### Silk and Tea: The Trade of Chun Mee Green Tea Turns Brisk

Yesterday, the green tea market was active. British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Union Insurance Society of Canton, Sincere Co., Ltd., Kin Lung, Tung Foo, and Ewo all started procuring Chun Mee green tea, and trade was brisk. The entire market saw transactions of over 340 chests. The selling price of new tea ranged from $348 to $390, while the selling price of old tea ranged from $170 to $120. Market prices have stabilized, but "extracted core" Chun Mee and Yunlu tea remain sluggish, and the market for "shrimp eye" Gong Zhu tea is also dull. Yesterday, 559 pieces of vegetable leaves arrived from Wenzhou, and today, 85 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### French Concession Strengthens Police Force to Respond to Rumors with Facts; Japan Should Recognize the Real Situation in Shanghai; the Five Conspiracies Are Intolerable to All Nations

Yesterday's editorial in the North-China Daily News refuted recent rumors that the French Concession would be handed over to the U.S. authorities for trusteeship as baseless, stating that the report was incredible. If the Japanese government recognizes the real situation in Shanghai, it will certainly not be deceived by such rumors. The French Concession authorities are preparing various measures to strengthen security forces so that their strength will not be affected by conscription in France. Because the facts are well known and there are no secrets to hide, the rumors seem to indicate that certain extremist elements intend to imitate Hitler's tricks, creating imaginary dangers and using them as an excuse to cause disturbances. The French Concession is a leased territory granted by the Chinese government to France, so the French will certainly not rashly hand it over to a third country for management. At the same time, the United States initially opposed the establishment of concessions in China, so it would not enter into a complex environment by taking over the administration of a concession in China for another country without first obtaining the permission of the Chinese government. Therefore, the rumors are absurd and not worth discussing further.

Reuters Reports Five Conspiracies

Recently, most of the rumors in Shanghai have targeted the Shanghai concessions. Reuters transmitted a report from Chongqing about five plans by the Japanese to seize the concessions: (1) The new regime would organize a "committee" composed of "Vice Minister" Xu Liang, "Legal Vice Minister" Zai Hanzhang, and "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiaoan to prepare for the takeover of the courts, police, and public institutions of the two special districts; (2) The Wang faction newspapers would promote the recovery of the concessions and launch an anti-British and anti-French movement; (3) The supply of water and electricity to the Public Concession from Yangshupu and to the French Concession from Nanshi would be stopped; (4) There would be plans to prevent food from entering the two concessions and to organize disturbances within the concessions, and then the Japanese army and puppet police would use the excuse of maintaining peace and order to enter the two concessions; (5) The Japanese side, in conjunction with the Italian military commander, would notify the authorities of the two concessions to hand over administrative institutions and withdraw troops, which has made the general public particularly concerned about the future of the Shanghai concessions.

Definitely Not Tolerable to All Nations

A reporter from the Ta Chung News Agency specifically inquired about this with a British diplomatic source yesterday. According to reports, he had not heard of what Chongqing had reported and was unable to speculate on the actual situation. However, the future of Shanghai is indeed of concern to the general public. The reporter then asked what attitude Britain, the United States, and France would take if the Japanese took action against the concessions. According to him, Shanghai is where the interests of Britain, the United States, and France are concentrated, and any threat would be intolerable to all nations. Maintaining the current status of the Shanghai concessions is a necessary condition for safeguarding their interests, so the authorities of all countries will jointly maintain the situation in Shanghai. Regarding the rumor that the special district courts would be taken over by the Japanese puppets, it is said that the special district courts are subject to agreements between the Chinese government and Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Brazil, and other countries, and no one can change them at will without the consent of the Chinese government and those countries.

Miura Once Imitated American and French Consuls

A Japanese spokesman stated at a press conference yesterday that if Italy were to enter the war, the Japanese military authorities in this city would not seize the administrative powers of the Public Concession and the French Concession and change the status quo of the concessions. The spokesman also stated that the Japanese military authorities had heard rumors that the French Concession would be taken over by the United States due to certain relations. Since the Japanese military authorities are responsible for maintaining order and security in the suburbs of Shanghai, they cannot help but worry about this rumor and fear that it will become a reality. To clarify the situation, Japanese Consul General Miura has visited the American and French authorities and said that the rumors are completely unfounded. The administrative authorities of the French Concession have also stated that even in the future, the administrative situation of the French Concession will not change in this way.

Difficult to Allow the Request for Map册

According to foreign sources, the puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to hand over the archive map册 deposited by the former Shanghai Land Bureau to the puppet "Municipal Government" on the 23rd of last month. These archive map册 consisted of 312 boxes. The Municipal Council immediately replied that "the consular corps of this city is currently considering the matter." The Municipal Council believes that the Municipal Government Land Bureau is an agency of the National Government, while the puppet "Municipal Government" is an institution that has not been recognized as legitimate by various countries, so its request should be rejected, and even if it is returned, it should be returned to the hands of the Chinese government.

Japanese Compensation for Loss of Shanghai University

A Japanese spokesperson also announced at a press conference yesterday that Shanghai University has received 1,060,000 yuan as compensation for wartime losses. The Japanese Navy has reached an agreement with the American Southern Baptist Convention and the American Baptist Convention. The compensation is to cover all losses of the school and its faculty and staff. According to Mr. Harold Probart, secretary of the American Baptist Convention, the compensation will be paid in two installments, one on the 29th of last month and the other on the 2nd of this month. The agreement between the two parties was signed on the 7th of this month.

### Shanghai Shops' Income Tax: Those with Branches in the Interior Can Pay There

In order to be considerate of the difficulties faced by merchants, the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance has expanded the scope of income tax payment methods. All shops' income tax or profit tax can be paid in any inland area. Shanghai shops with branches in the interior can pay in the interior. Various chambers of commerce have ordered all merchants to comply.

### The Last Batch of European Jewish Refugees, a Total of 120 People, Arrived and Disembarked in Shanghai Yesterday

According to the English-language "The China Press," a batch of 120 European Jewish refugees arrived and disembarked in Shanghai yesterday (the 6th) on the Italian postal ship "Conte Verde." It is said that this is likely the last batch of European immigrants to come here via the Suez route. However, a small number of other immigrants may travel on Japanese ships. The Shanghai Jewish Refugee Committee is currently seeking cooperation from the Japanese authorities to resettle Jewish refugees from Shanghai in Siberia. Regarding the sailing of various postal ships of the Italian Shipping Company, the company recently stated that it will continue to sail on the usual dates because the restrictions imposed by the Italian government have been relaxed.

### French Ambassador

Although French Ambassador Cosme and his wife are concerned about the war situation and the affairs of the embassy in Shanghai, their trip to North China will not be delayed and they will travel to Beidaihe in mid-June to escape the summer heat. Their secretary and attendants will leave Shanghai for the north after the ambassador leaves, changing to depart after the 20th of this month.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Implement Tax Increase on a Regular Basis: Includes Land Tax, House Tax, License Fee, etc.; Hotel Industry Resolved to Increase Room Rates Yesterday

The Shanghai Municipal Council's decision to increase taxes by 50 percent will be implemented starting next month, July 1. The tax increase includes all taxes such as land tax, house tax, license fees, and fees for using land easements. Details are listed below.

Increased Tax Items

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council decided to increase various taxes by 50 percent starting on July 1 of this year, taxpayers in the concession have requested a postponement due to rising prices and difficult living conditions. However, the Municipal Council has decided to implement the increase as scheduled because it concerns the entire municipal budget. The increased tax items and payment methods are listed below: (1) Land Tax: The land tax within the Public Concession is levied at 9 per mille of the land price. Starting on July 1 of this year, an additional tax of 50 percent will be levied, both of which are to be paid in advance every six months by the lessees. (2) Municipal General Tax: Houses in the Public Concession are subject to a municipal general tax of 18 percent of the estimated rental value. Starting on July 1 of this year, an additional tax of 50 percent will be levied, both of which are to be paid in advance every quarter by the householder. (3) Municipal Special Tax: Houses outside the concession that enjoy the convenience of various facilities owned by the Municipal Council (including public utilities) are subject to a municipal special tax of 16 percent of the estimated rental value. Starting on July 1 of this year, an additional tax of 50 percent will be levied, both of which are to be paid in advance every quarter by the householder. (4) License Fees: All license fees and other fees payable up to June 30 of this year will each be subject to an additional fee of 10 percent. From July 1 of this year until the next meeting of the taxpayers, an additional fee of 50 percent will be levied.

Land Easements

Starting on July 1 of this year, an additional fee of 50 percent will be levied on all fees for the use of land easements in the Public Concession. The so-called land easement refers to the following items: (1) Gasoline pumps and oil storage tanks installed beside and under the road; (2) Gas transmission pillars installed beside the road; (3) Pipes installed under the road; (4) Conveyors, cranes, and scaffolding crossing the road; (5) The use of the Municipal Council's remaining land as a turnaround for trams and buses; (6) Pavilions built on the Municipal Council's property; (7) Signs installed on the wharf and road; (8) Awnings protruding onto the road.

Hotel Industry Increases Prices

After the Shanghai Municipal Council increased the business license tax for Chinese-style apartments to 150 percent starting in April of this year, the hotels have expressed their serious concerns. The industry association has appealed to various influential groups for assistance and has negotiated with the council, requesting that it withdraw the decision. Later, the council replied that it would implement the resolution and would consider reducing it when the industry's business was slack. However, staff were dispatched to collect the taxes in full starting in April. However, the hotels had no way to argue and painfully paid in full, which slightly increased their monthly expenses. In view of the sharp increase in expenses, the hotels have sent letters to the hotel industry association requesting a moderate increase in room rates. Some have even automatically increased prices, resulting in extremely chaotic selling prices. In order to rectify market prices, the industry association convened a joint meeting of all executive, supervisory, and committee members the other day, with all committee members attending and Chairman Xu Wenzhao presiding. As a result of the deliberations, it was decided that starting on the 15th of this month, all hotels in the British and French concessions, whether high, medium, or low, will generally increase room rates by 30 percent. Those found to have exceeded 30 percent will be severely punished if there is evidence. Customers who find instances of overpricing can secretly report them to the industry association for investigation and handling.

### Ningbo Relief Rice Fundraiser Meeting Held; Over One Million Yuan Pledged; Shaoxing Rice Price Rises Above 100 Yuan; People Struggle with Famine and Disease, Unable to Endure

The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai held a Ningbo relief rice fundraiser meeting at 5 PM yesterday in the grand hall of its association headquarters on Yu Qiaqing Road. Over 500 people from various industries and fellow villagers attended. Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runqing, and Zhang Jiguang were publicly elected as the temporary presidium. Chairman Yu Qiaqing first delivered an opening speech, stating, "This rice shortage in Ningbo is due to poor transportation, preventing sufficient grain imports. Since receiving the plea for help from our hometown, the association has begun raising funds for relief. However, purchasing rice in Shanghai and transporting it to Ningbo would incur heavy water transportation fees, exchange fees, and taxes, increasing the cost of the relief rice. Therefore, we are directly ordering foreign rice from production areas to transport to Ningbo, while also requesting the authorities to exempt taxes and provide free currency exchange for relief rice transported to Ningbo. Since the arrival of relief rice in Ningbo, local rice prices have been suppressed. The price of relief rice is 30 yuan per stone, with each yuan buying five catties. However, the need for funds is enormous, and we hope all attendees will actively donate."

Fundraising Objectives

Following reports from Wu Anqin, Fang Jiaoxun, and Kui Yanfang, discussions began on: (1) the draft organizational charter for the fundraising committee, which was approved; (2) the fundraising procedures, which were approved; (3) the amount of donations, with a target of 2 million yuan, which was approved; (4) the deadline for pledged donations to be paid up by the 22nd, which was approved. Then, a temporary motion was made, briefly mentioned, and the "Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai Relief Rice Fundraising Committee Organizational Charter Draft" was passed.

Enthusiastic Pledges

Warm-hearted Ningbo natives in Shanghai pledged generously. Yesterday, on the spot pledges reached 1,082,000 yuan, including: (1) 462,000 yuan raised; (2) 385,000 yuan pledged by various industries; (3) 235,000 yuan in self-donations. Excerpts of the pledges and donations from various industries are as follows: (A) Fundraising: Yu Qiaqing 100,000 yuan, Qin Runqing 100,000 yuan, Zhang Jiguang 100,000 yuan, Kui [blank] 50,000 yuan, [blank] 30,000 yuan, [blank], Lu Deng 30,000 yuan, Le Zhenbao 20,000 yuan, Chen Qingzhao 20,000 yuan, Wang Qishou 3,000 yuan, Huang Zhensheng 3,000 yuan, Yu Bao three 2,000 yuan, Lin Erqing 2,000 yuan, Chen Quanrong 1,000 yuan, Lin Huanzhang 1,000 yuan, etc. (B) Donations from various industries: hardware, cotton cloth, paper, copper and tin, iron, banking, seafood, cotton yarn, ginseng and bird's nest, hardware parts, seasonings, thermos bottle manufacturing, tin printing and can making, woolen fabrics, fresh and salted fish, biscuit, etc. The receiving institutions are Siming, Kenye, Quangong, Fuyuanzhuang, etc.

Eating Grass and Tree Bark

Recently, the food panic in various counties of eastern Zhejiang has reached its peak. According to a person from Shaoxing, rice prices in Shaoxing have soared since the beginning of spring, an unprecedented event. From 50 yuan, it rose to 60-70 yuan, and around the 20th of last month, it soared to 82 yuan. Around the 1st of this month, it skyrocketed to around 120 yuan. Currently, the people of Shaoxing treat rice like precious jewels. Over 99% of them use wheat bran, rice husks, and soybeans to fill their stomachs. The rest, unable to find a solution, eat wild grass, tree bark, and white mud dug from black soil to stave off hunger. As a result, deaths from starvation are common. Furthermore, due to [war] and [disease], the people of Shaoxing, weakened by hunger, are unable to endure. Once infected, they collapse and die. This spring, during the early rice transplanting season, due to scarce rainfall, rivers dried up, making cultivation impossible. Based on this prediction, the autumn harvest will certainly not be bountiful, so residents are in constant fear.

### Fake "Market" Merged, Concentrated, and Monopolized

The Continental News reports that the "Central Market," under Japanese patronage, had its vegetable monopoly rights stripped last month by a rival "market," thwarting the Japanese attempt to monopolize local produce. Yesterday (the 6th), it was learned that this attempt has been revived. Japanese sources say that the "Central Market" will soon be merged into its rival "Shanghai Market" to "eliminate conflicts and internal strife." It is also rumored that the Third Institute

The rival market, namely the "Wusong Foodstuffs Market," will also be merged in the future, thus completing the Japanese monopoly plan. If this happens, vegetable prices in Shanghai will continue to soar. Local produce entering Shanghai is already subject to complete control, and vegetable vendors must pay huge sums in taxes. Currently, local produce entering the two concessions is subject to extremely heavy taxes, causing retail prices to be at least ten times the original price in the production area. Furthermore, vegetable vendors joining the "Central Market" and others must pay 50,000 yuan in cash to the "Market Management Office." It is noted that

Vegetables transported to Shanghai were first monopolized by the "Central Market" on North Suzhou Road in March of this year. Subsequently, the "City Government" permitted the establishment of two similar "markets," one being the "Wusong Foodstuffs Market," established in early April, which had the right to control vegetables transported from the Shanghai suburbs. Shortly thereafter, the "Shanghai Market" appeared in Hongkou, with control methods similar to the "Wusong Foodstuffs Market." Due to its central location, it profited the most. Vegetable vendors estimate that at least half of the vegetables consumed in the city pass through the "Shanghai Market."

### Public Works Committee Meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council

Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, the Public Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting in the council's conference room. Committee members present included Jiang Yiping, Alerman, Kanai, Herlan, Liddell, and others. They discussed matters related to public utilities within the settlement. The result was that the resolutions discussed would be submitted to the Board of Directors.

### Swire Dockworkers' Strike Unresolved; All Ships Temporarily Halt Export; Company Insists on Original Contract Terms; Workers' Opinions Also Divided

The stevedores of the British-owned Taikoo Dockyard, due to recent financial difficulties, demanded a wage increase from their contracting foremen on the afternoon of the 6th to make a living, and after working for a quarter of an hour after lunch, they went on strike together, and the work on each ship was immediately stopped. The circumstances have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper, and now we know that after the workers went on strike in the afternoon of the 6th, they went to Yangjiadu, Pudong, to meet and discuss, and then submitted a written request to the foreman yesterday morning, which was delivered to the two contracting foremen. The content was slightly the same as the oral request recorded in yesterday's newspaper, but the 30% wage increase has been changed to a 50% increase. After receiving the workers' medical requirements, the two contracting foremen turned the request letter over to Taikoo Dockyard and asked for instructions. Labor and labor also took place at 12:30 pm yesterday at 36 Yong'an Street (formerly Chunhe Tea House).

Negotiations Upstairs

At that time, the foreman sent two representatives to attend, and the workers' side included representatives from the three or four warehouses and Tianjin ships, a total of more than ten people. The two sides talked for more than an hour, but there was no result. It is reported that the workers' opinions were also divided, so they argued with each other during the talks, making the solution even more difficult. As for Taikoo Dockyard, after receiving the letter of request from the foreman, it insisted on Article 10 of the second month that the price should not be increased within six months, and ignored the letter. For the strike, the responsibility was quickly dealt with by the two foremen. According to the foreman's side, they are the intermediary between the company and the workers, and the company Xiaoyoujia fee, the workers

Unwilling to Give Way

It is really difficult for seven women to cook without rice, and they are at a loss. It is difficult to solve the strike for a while, resulting in the Hunan wheel, which should have left for Beiyang yesterday afternoon, being temporarily suspended from export because the goods could not be fully loaded. The Qiongzhou wheel, which entered the port the day before yesterday, had not yet unloaded its goods, and the export goods had been piled up at the pier. The original plan to leave for Hong Kong and Haiphong today also had to be postponed. The Yingzhou wheel also arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and stopped at Taikoo Dockyard No. 3. Because the incoming goods were not unloaded, today's export will also be impossible. The ship changed to an oil pontoon yesterday.

Waiting Quietly for a Solution

Afterwards, it docked at the port to load and unload goods. The Shuntian, the regular ship on the company's Beiyang line, arrived in Shanghai on the 4th, and the incoming goods had been unloaded. Because the regular ship cannot be delayed, it will be anchored at 10:00 am today, without loading goods, and the empty ship will be exported to Tianjin, and will also stop at Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai and other places along the way. It is also known that the Nanyang Customs Declaration Office has seen that the company's workers are on strike, resulting in the declared goods failing to be exported on schedule and suffering heavy losses, and also sent representatives to the company yesterday afternoon to inquire and hope to resolve the matter as soon as possible. The company still ordered the foreman to be responsible for resolving the incident because the workers had a contract. Therefore, it is feared that this case will be difficult to resolve in the next two days of this week, and can only wait for development next week.

### Shanghai-Europe Postal Route May Be Changed; Mediterranean Situation Suddenly Changes; Likely to Detour Around the Cape of Good Hope

Since the outbreak of the European war, postal delivery between Shanghai and Europe has not been disrupted. However, all mail from Belgium and the Netherlands is now being routed by the Shanghai Postal Administration through Germany. All mail from British and French nationals in Shanghai has abandoned the Siberian route and is being transported by liners to avoid being inspected and detained when passing through German territory, causing the Suez Canal route between Shanghai and Europe to be very congested. However, recently, due to the tense situation in the Mediterranean, if war breaks out, liners between Shanghai and Europe are likely to detour around the Cape of Good Hope for delivery. Although it will take up to a month or so, round trips will still be extremely safe. In addition, they can also be transported along the Pacific route. Therefore, although the European war is fierce, postal delivery in Shanghai will definitely not be interrupted, it is said.

### University Professor Shen Xingwu Assassinated and Died Yesterday; Three Shots to the Body Caused Instant Death; Assailant Escaped on a Bicycle

A shooting occurred at 215 Lane, Meibaige Road, Public Concession, (Xinyu Li) at approximately 12:45 PM yesterday. The victim was Shen Xingwu, a university professor of profound knowledge and noble character. He was unfortunately shot three times, all in vital areas, resulting in his immediate death. The assailant escaped on a bicycle after the incident. A reporter inquired and learned the details as follows:

Returning Home After Class, Encountering an Ambush

Yesterday afternoon at 12:45 PM, Shen Xingwu, wearing a gray long gown and yellow leather shoes, had just finished teaching at the private Shanghai Middle School at the corner of Jing'an Temple Chengdu Road and was returning home for lunch. Because it was not far from home, he walked at a leisurely pace. When he was about to reach his residence, entering the vicinity of the first lane of Xinyu Li, he did not expect an assailant on a bicycle to follow him closely. Seeing Shen enter the lane, he abandoned the bike at the entrance of the lane and immediately drew a gun and shot at Shen. A total of three shots were fired. Shen could not avoid them and was immediately hit in the head by two bullets, entering from the back of the head and exiting from the left temple. One bullet entered from the back and pierced through the chest. He immediately fell to the ground, blood flowing profusely, with only a faint breath remaining, his life hanging by a thread. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the assailant turned around and hurriedly rode away on his original bike. Afterward, a neighbor ran to inform his family. His wife, Mrs. Zhao, rushed out to see and saw her husband lying stiff in a pool of blood, already dead. She was almost overwhelmed with grief and immediately reported to the Xinzha Police Station by phone. They immediately dispatched detectives to the scene of the incident, but the murderer had already fled without a trace. They summoned a car to send Shen to the morgue of Baolong Hospital and investigated the true cause of Shen's death in order to track down the murderer and bring him to justice.

Encouraging Students to Resist and Build the Nation

Shen Xingwu was 46 years old and a native of Changzhou. He rarely socialized and lived with his wife, Mrs. Zhao (a 34-year-old native of Suzhou), in the right wing room upstairs at 52, 295 Lane, Meibaige Road. They had a deep affection for each other and were inseparable, but they had no children. Shen graduated from Nanyang Public School and studied at Columbia University in the United States, where he studied diligently and obtained a Master of Science degree and a degree in Chemical Engineering. After returning to China, he served as a professor at Beijing Normal University and Beijing University, and as the editor-in-chief of the Beiyang Library. He came to Shanghai in the 20th year of the Republic of China, and various universities competed to invite him. He is currently teaching at Jinan University, Nantong College, and private Shanghai Middle School Yuhua Middle School, often encouraging students to resist and build the nation. Everyone who heard about his death was saddened by it.

### Robber Sentenced to Death for Murder

Sheng Yinghua, an employee of Hongxun Cotton Cloth Shop at 12 Jingxingli, Tianjin Road, was carrying 4,000 yuan in legal tender on May 5th when he was suddenly robbed at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Ningbo Road. At that time, Wang Shousen, a patrolman from the nearby Money Exchange Association, stepped forward to chase after the robber, resulting in an exchange of gunfire. As a result, Patrolman Wang was shot in a vital area and died, while the robber Zhang Yaorong (21 years old, from Huzhou) was also wounded in the foot by bullets and arrested. A pistol was seized. The case was handed over to the Special First Court, where the police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for robbery and murder. The trial has concluded, and Feng Shide, the judge of the criminal court, pronounced the verdict yesterday morning: Zhang Yaorong was sentenced to death for robbery and murder, and for intentional homicide, to be carried out concurrently, with permanent deprivation of civil rights and confiscation of the firearm. After the sentence was pronounced, [the judge] informed Zhang that because you have committed several other robbery cases in the French Concession, today I will hand you over to the special investigators of the Second Court to investigate further. The Zhang criminal heard the sentence, did not speak in tears, and was escorted by the police to Yao Zhupo, a detective from the French Police Department, to take away.

### Young Wife Requests Divorce, Defendant Denies Abuse

Geng Zhisheng, a sixteen-year-old girl from Zhenjiang who currently resides at 4 Run'an Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, has recently retained lawyer Shi Zhenchang to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against her husband, Shen Kunnan (24 years old, local resident residing at 271 Ximen Road), seeking a divorce. She claims that since marrying into the family, she has been subjected to abuse. Last year, she was forced to work in a factory. Due to her young age and inability to endure the hardships, she fell seriously ill. Seeing this, the defendant sent the plaintiff back to her mother's home, neglecting her. This year, he also terminated the lease on their residence, moving everything away and leaving the plaintiff homeless for three days and nights. Fortunately, a relative persuaded the plaintiff to return to her mother's home. [She claims that] due to such abuse, she is compelled to request a divorce. According to the court record, Judge Li summoned [the parties] yesterday, and the plaintiff, accompanied by her lawyer, arrived in court to testify as stated above. When questioned, the defendant denied any abuse. The court reviewed the situation and scheduled a continuation for the fourth day of the month to summon witnesses and re-examine [the case].

### Three Defendants Prosecuted According to Law for Kidnapping School Children

Chen Kangjun, the young owner of Renyuanyong Gift Shop at 383 Hankou Road, eleven years old, was kidnapped on his way to Hudong Elementary School on Fuzhou Road at seven o'clock on the morning of the 21st of last month. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of 50,000 yuan from his parents. As a result, due to the carelessness of the kidnappers, he took the opportunity to escape and reported to the Central Police Station, which led detectives to the kidnapper's den at 44, 1107 Lane, Dongyouheng Road, and arrested five suspects including Shi Wangshi (also known as Xue Wangshi). [They] were handed over to the Special First Court, and a request to change the trial date was legally filed, and the case was registered. The case was continued yesterday afternoon, and the police filed a public prosecution against Shi Wangshi, Zhao Guojun, and Wei Xianshan for helping to kidnap and extort. For the remaining defendants, a request was made to continue postponing the date, on the grounds that the evidence still needed to be completely investigated. Judge Feng ordered all the defendants to be returned to custody and postponed the date for another week for questioning.

A verbal dispute arose, and Zhang immediately kicked Lin in the lower abdomen, causing internal injuries. [Lin] reported the case to the French Police Department, and Zhang was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. [The police] also sent detectives to arrest the defendant Zhang Zhenghua and sent him to the Special Second Court for questioning and detention, waiting for the victim to recover before being questioned. The court also sent a forensic doctor to the hospital to examine the victim's injuries pending verification. But Zhang suddenly did not want to be treated at Guangci Hospital, and requested the police station to send him to Baokelu Baojiang Hospital for treatment on the 3rd. However, due to the injury car ineffective treatment, he died at 7:20 a.m. yesterday. The hospital reported to the French Police Department, and the body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy.

### An Italian Woman Seriously Injured in the Pipa Nightclub Assault; Woman Claims a Valuable Gold Bracelet Was Also Snatched; Two Suspects Arrested, Who Claimed the Woman Refused to Pay the Bill

The North China Daily News reports that Mrs. Connie Scoglio, a 34-year-old Italian national, was assaulted by two Westerners at the Pipa Nightclub at 1337 Yu Garden Road yesterday (the 6th) morning at approximately 8:30 AM, sustaining serious injuries.

she eventually collapsed.

She was rushed to the Country Hospital. Upon receiving the report, the police dispatched detectives to investigate. At noon, a 34-year-old Russian man, Peter Babeff, who worked at the Pipa Nightclub, and a 29-year-old unrecognized Polish man, Albert Kowics, were arrested and taken to the

police station for questioning.

Police officials stated that the case is currently under investigation and declined to release any information. The injured Italian woman's husband is believed to be in Qingdao. The Italian woman originally went to the Pipa Nightclub with another person, but the other woman had already left before the incident occurred.

(Another Report) Yesterday (the 6th) morning at 8:30 AM, an Italian woman was

seriously injured in an assault

at the Pipa (transliterated) wine bar on Yu Garden Road. The woman, Alexandra Consigli (transliterated), reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station that morning, accusing a Russian employee of the wine bar, Peter Saise (34 years old), and a Polish man, Albert Kogoff (29 years old), of snatching a bracelet worth $1,800 from her arm and kicking and punching her. Due to the serious injuries, the police arrested the two

defendants.

The injured woman was taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment. According to the statements of the two defendants, the woman refused to pay the bill after eating and drinking, so they forced her to pay. They denied snatching the bracelet. The police are investigating the case as both parties have conflicting accounts.

The incident was reported to the police, who sent someone to take the body to the morgue, awaiting a report to the court for an inquest.

### Thunder Chicken

There is a thunder chicken in Zhuozheng Garden on Suqun North Street, as large as a stork, with colorful and mottled feathers, especially like a turkey. Observers deliberately provoke it, and it flaps its wings and wags its tail, making a loud noise that shakes the ground, like thunder. It is said that this creature is produced in Leizhou, Guangdong, so it should not be surprising. However, the people of Suzhou have never seen it, so they all want to be the first to see it.

### Pig Anomaly

A butcher in Yangzhou was driving eight pigs the other day, about to slaughter them, when they passed Liuxiang. Unexpectedly, the pigs suddenly rushed into a mansion, from the gate to the hall, from the hall to the room, and in front of the shrine, the pigs all stood upright, making a gesture of cupping their hands. The owner of the mansion saw this and was surprised. He paid the price for the pigs and generously released them. It is now heard that they have been sent to Jinghui Temple outside the South Gate for raising.

### Optimistic Victory

From all perspectives, the prevalent philosophy we can find today is pessimism. We can encounter people who embrace pessimism anytime, anywhere. Their ideal is that the world is doomed to destruction, and the forces of justice are destined to fail—they are the prophets of melancholy and disaster. The most unfortunate thing is that many extremely melancholic and disheartened people often claim to be the most religiously devout. Many religious messages preach about the dim and bleak state of humanity. Many devout people in churches lament that the golden age when churches thrived like trees has passed. They are like those who escort religion to its funeral, content to crawl on religion's grave, admitting that the days when religion was a genuine power in human affairs have passed. Anyone with awareness is hesitant to be an unthinking optimist. Optimists who say everything is lovely without thinking are as undesirable as pessimists. We cannot close our eyes to the current state of the world; we cannot accept that the current situation is ideal or capable of self-salvation. Anything we ourselves do not begin working to build, we will not be able to accomplish. Therefore, we must confront current facts, assess their reality, and seek an optimistic solution for ourselves. Historically, those who uphold religion and justice have always borne the responsibility of guarding this troubled world. Christianity arose from just such a society and continues to struggle with it. Christians began by establishing churches in Roman cities, and then the churches expanded into the countryside, gradually gaining control over the entire Roman Empire. However, paganism was deeply rooted in the countryside. The word "pagan" in Latin originally meant a fortified position in the countryside, where other forces were not allowed to enter. Rural people worshiped ancestors and were stubbornly resistant to change. They believed that the world was hopelessly bad and that humanity was destined to be the sacrifice and slaves of the gods. The gods controlled people through emotions, and people relied on the gods' mercy to survive, with no way to escape. (To be continued)

War

### Parachute Rescue Squad

— Economy

In the midst of war, many soldiers are often wounded and lie in the "no man's land" of the front lines or in mountainous areas with poor transportation. If the rescue team cannot reach them in time, the wounded soldiers often lose their lives due to delayed treatment, weakening the army's fighting power. To avoid such losses, it is necessary to immediately send doctors or excellent nurses to the battlefield to treat the wounded soldiers, in order to preserve the lives of these warriors.

Therefore, the parachute rescue squad came into being. An airplane carrying many nurses flies over mountainous areas with poor transportation, observing the wounded soldiers lying below. Suddenly, a mass of white objects falls from the plane, rotating in space. Gradually, the white objects spread out, turning into many parachutes. Under the parachutes are nurses, slowly descending near the wounded soldiers.

The nurses hurriedly remove the parachutes tied to their bodies and rush to the wounded soldiers to provide medical care. After a moment, they have already applied ointment and bandaged the wounds of the soldiers. The wounded soldiers, after receiving their emergency treatment, now have hope of recovery.

The originator of this parachute rescue squad is Mrs. S. ONill Dranem of France. She herself is a nurse and also a parachute expert. Recently, a reporter visited her.

She said: "Our purpose is very simple: we are organizing a rescue team and stretcher-bearer team so that we can quickly rush to the war zones with poor transportation at any time to treat the wounded soldiers in that area. If a warrior is wounded and lying in a difficult-to-reach mountain ravine, we can immediately fly in an airplane to save his life. Otherwise, by the time the ordinary stretcher-bearer team walks there, the wounded soldier would have already died.

"This undertaking is not easy. To be a parachute rescuer, one must be brave, determined, and bold. Therefore, before anyone joins our rescue team, they must first pass the same rigorous examination as a pilot, because this is not a child's play.

"After passing the examination, they must undergo three months of training before they can serve.

"Jumping down from an airplane is also not a simple matter. Parachutists should consider the speed of the plane and the wind force, etc. They should not only land safely, but also land in a suitable location.

"Therefore, this undertaking is indeed difficult and dangerous. Out of two hundred female students who registered for the exam, only fifty passed, and only twenty-five were able to graduate.

"But this is a great and sacred undertaking, because parachute rescuers risk their own lives when treating others. Their spirit of service is truly worthy of our admiration…"

Essays

### "Following My Inclinations"

— Yan Zheng

Because she wanted to earn some pocket money, my sister took on some "home work" from a glove exporter. She began to knit very seriously from the start. That short crochet hook seemed to have formed an inseparable relationship with her slender hands. Gradually, she shortened her sleep time, starting work at the break of dawn. Despite being so diligent, she could only knit one glove a day at most. This sometimes made her feel indignant. "Speculators earn thousands, tens of thousands in one go, while I knit to death, only earning a few cents a day!" While murmuring, her hands unconsciously and quickly started moving again.

As for me, I often move my pen, writing things that I myself don't even know what they are, to swindle some money from book buyers. But sometimes, when I suddenly think about how worthless my own brainpower is, I can't help but throw down my pen and sigh, wanting to get rid of this bitter business and learn some "shortcut to wealth." Even a sage like Confucius once said, "Even if it's a whip-holding job, I would do it!"

The pity is: first, to get rich, one must first have capital. Without capital, one cannot dream of getting rich. Second, after witnessing the recent huge losses of several so-called "speculators," I can't help but feel disheartened, knowing that wealth and status are unattainable. Moreover, "fundamental wealth is the best, commercial wealth is second, and wealth gained by treachery is the worst."

Every day, at the break of dawn, when my sister starts knitting, it is also when I start writing. We are simply "following our inclinations"!

### Churchill's Poem

— Li Yi

After reading Churchill's speech, we cannot help but congratulate England on having found a capable person.

Churchill was the First Lord of the Admiralty during World War I. It was after Chamberlain stepped down that he was finally recognized as the only all-rounder and rose to replace him.

When reporting on the war situation, Churchill was not only full of heroic spirit, but also did not bury his head in the sand and did not shy away from failure. He revealed the truth of the war entirely to the eyes of the people of the world, thereby expressing his fearlessness of failure and his determination to fight to the end.

He said: "We shall persevere to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender…"

When we read this passage, we simply suspect that we are not reading a speech, but reciting a good poem from the pen of a war poet.

Churchill's spirit of resistance is worth emulating, and Churchill's words are worth remembering.

Cultivation

### Life and Opportunity

— Xianyi Translation

"Lack of opportunity" is often the self-comfort of those who are weak-willed and hesitant.

In fact, every life is filled with them. Every course in middle school or university is an opportunity; every exam is an opportunity in life; every commercial transaction is also an opportunity - a polite opportunity, a brave opportunity, an honest opportunity, an opportunity to make friends. Every evidence of your credibility is also a great opportunity. The responsibility of your strength and dignity is invaluable. Survival is the privilege of effort. When a person encounters that privilege, opportunities come faster than you can utilize them.

Young men and women! Why are you standing around lazily all day? Has the world been filled before you were born? Has the earth stopped its production? Are all positions filled? Are all the seats taken? Have all the opportunities gone? Have the rich resources of your country been fully developed? Have the secrets of nature been discovered? Is it really impossible for you to use the methods described in the past to do something to advance yourself or benefit others?

Don't wait for your opportunity, go forward! Like Napoleon struggling in his desperate circumstances, go forward! Like every leader - whether in peacetime or wartime, turn their opportunity into true success, go forward! Like everyone who wants to accomplish a task worthy of effort.

Good opportunities are of no help to the lazy; only diligence can turn the most ordinary opportunities into good ones. - Original by O.S. Manden

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter One "A Very Beautiful Lady!"

"Mr. Hawthorne, I can't accompany you now. Let's talk about other things after you've investigated. I haven't slept yet."

I sighed inwardly. The life of a dancer is pitiful enough. As I entered the bedroom, I heard the telephone ringing downstairs again. Hawthorne's voice on the phone also seemed very tense and loud, which made me speed up my clothing actions.

When I came downstairs dressed in a gray, domestically produced light gray tweed suit, the dancer had already left. Hawthorne was placing the magnifying glass, ruler, lead powder, camel hair brush, paper pieces, and other items he would need into his overcoat pocket. Because in the past few days, he always wore that mouse-colored thin coat when going out in the morning and evening. He didn't say much, and his face was very tense, which I hadn't noticed before going upstairs.

I asked, "Who called?"

Hawthorne replied with a serious face, "Detective Ni."

Ni Jinshou is a long-time friend of Hawthorne. Anyone who knows Hawthorne will also be familiar with his name. He has been serving in the police force for more than twenty years, and due to his diligent efforts over the years, he has been promoted to his current position. However, if quantitative analysis could be applied, a certain percentage of his achievements would probably belong to Hawthorne. Ni Jinshou, however, is not like the clever opportunists who "forget old friends as soon as they succeed." He still maintains considerable respect for Hawthorne, and whenever there are difficult or relatively important cases, he still maintains contact with Hawthorne. The fact that this call came from him shows that a tricky case has occurred.

I asked again, "What happened?"

Hawthorne replied, "What a coincidence, it's the blood case of the dancing queen Wang Lilan. But the source of this information is different from the previous one." (8)

### Rising Tide of Scientist Films

— Rong Shang

Films based on the biographies of scientists are not uncommon in film history. As far as I can remember, there are "The Story of Louis Pasteur," "Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet," and "The Story of Alexander Graham Bell," all of which have left a deep impression on movie fans. In addition, "Madame Curie" and "Edison, the Man" have been heavily promoted for a long time and are currently still in production. These two blockbusters feature the famous movie stars Greta Garbo and Spencer Tracy in the lead roles, with child star Tony Gaetano playing the young Edison. The cast selection can be described as a match made in heaven, flawless, and the performance is sure to be satisfactory.

Recently, I heard that making scientist films has become a trend in Hollywood. Warner Bros. has also decided to adapt the story of the German chemist Ehrlich, the inventor of "Salvarsan 606," the "magic bullet" for syphilis, into a film, starring the tough guy Edward G. Robinson.

MGM also has a film in the planning stage, titled "Conquest of Pain," which tells the inspiring story of the invention of anesthetics in medical history. There is also news that the story of Dr. Goldberg, the public health official who successfully eradicated pellagra, will also be recreated on the screen.

Scientist films mostly portray the so-called "lasting fame" of scientists for benefiting humanity, inspiring people to admire them. Their educational value is, of course, far from comparable to erotic films that promote large thighs and bosoms. I hope that when these films are released, movie fans in Shanghai will appreciate them carefully.

### Complete Review of Talents from the Five Departments of Fu Lian Cheng Troupe (Middle)

— Only Me

Among the "Shi" generation, two Dan actors were the focus of attention during their time in the troupe: Li Shifang and Mao Shilai. Shifang specialized in Qingyi roles, while Shilai specialized in Huadan roles. The two had completely different acting styles, and each had their own supporters during their time in the troupe, so their reputations and positions were equal. Their supporters even gave them the titles "Little Mei Lanfang" and "Little Xiao Cuihua." However, after leaving the troupe, Shifang's voice was uncooperative, and she couldn't sing a single word, so her talent couldn't be put to use and she couldn't take on leading roles. Shilai, on the other hand, stood on her own, becoming a popular leading actress. In addition to Shilai and Shifang, there were also Liu Shilian and Bo Shiyun, who were also Dan actors in the fifth department, but their skills were average. They are now both supporting actors in Ping Opera and are getting old. Among the "Shi" generation, there are three Lao Dan actors: Shi Shibao, Cao Shijia, and Xie Shi'an. Among the three, Shibao's acting skills are the best, and he was also the most popular during his time in the troupe. He was taught by Li Shengquan from the fourth department and privately studied Li Duokui, so he was quite similar. He recorded records such as "Fishing for a Golden Turtle," and it was almost indistinguishable from the original. He was a promising young Lao Dan actor. It is a pity that his voice deteriorated after leaving the troupe and has not recovered. This is also regrettable; otherwise, at a time when Lao Dan talent is scarce, Shibao would have been able to make the Lao Dan role shine. Cao Shijia is the grandson of veteran actor Cao Xinquan. He later abandoned Lao Dan and learned Erlu Laosheng, but did not become famous. Xie Shi'an also works as Lao Dan (Shibao also works as Erlu Lao Dan). His acting style is different from Shibao's and is not based on singing, but he still has his merits. He is now in Ping Opera. As for Wudan, the fifth department has many talents. Ge Shishan, who is now famous in Shanghai, is one of them. In addition, there are also Wang Shixiang and Ban Shichao. The skills of these three were all supported by Ge Lanqiu (Jiuzhenfeng). However, Shishan is Lanqiu's nephew and is naturally intelligent, so his skills are superior. The Wugong of the other two are not weak. Wang Shixiang's appearance is slightly lacking and is now a subordinate of Wusheng Zhang Yunxi (he previously came to Shanghai with Zhang). Ban Shichao, on the other hand, has both good Wugong and appearance and is also a rare talent in this area.

### "China" Efforts to Make New Films

The China Film Studio yesterday gave a notice to the Hai Xing Society, which included: "The work of 'China Production' will be temporarily suspended. This is solely to shoot new films." It is thought that the rumor is unfounded. After the completion of the five major new films of the Studio, it is decided not to delay publicity work and to continue shooting new films, including Situ Huimin's "Women's Army," Sun Yu's "Young Pioneers," Shen Siling's "One Year," Yuan Yemei's "Mother's Creation," Shi Dongshan's "Long Live China," Ying Yunshu's "Three Warriors," He Feiguang's "The Birth of New China," Li Zhiqing's "Humanity…?", and Wan Chaochen's animated feature film "Traitor's Collection." Please treat this as news to be issued on our behalf, to clarify the situation. The source of film and materials is not difficult, and will not affect our work."

### Gone With the Wind (3)

— Yao Senyuan

"Gone With the Wind" by Margaret Mitchell

After several years of war, it finally stopped, the North and South were unified, and Ashley also returned home after being discharged from the army. Scarlett's parents died one after another, and Melanie had a child. At this time, due to the decline after the war, an economic panic occurred, especially in the South, where the people could not live. Therefore, Scarlett and Ashley in Atlanta also felt pain. Scarlett hoped to elope with Ashley to the North to live, because she had remained a widow until now for Ashley, but unexpectedly, Ashley refused. Although Ashley also loved her, he could not abandon his wife and daughter to go to the North with Scarlett. Scarlett was disappointed and felt very painful. She thought that the only person who could help her now was Rhett, because before the end of the war, he had said to her, "I Want you more than I have ever wanted any women and I've waited Ionger for you than Jve ever Waited for any woman." She thought that if she could marry him, money and life would definitely not be a problem.

Scarlett arrived in the North and learned that Rhett had been imprisoned because he had embezzled government funds. So she went to the prison to try to borrow money from him and marry him. As a result, Rhett's attitude had changed, and her request was mostly rejected. Her plan failed this time, and she thought there was no way out. Coincidentally, she met Frank on the road, Suellen's lover. He was injured in the war and now runs a sawmill in the North, which is very profitable. He plans to marry Suellen next year. When Scarlett heard that he was doing well and had opened a factory, she wanted to pursue her selfish purpose. She wanted to take her sister's lover as her own husband, so she expressed that she was very lonely now and was willing to remarry, and lied that Suellen was going to marry another man next month. Frank heard her lie and thought it was true, and also saw that Scarlett had some affection for him, so he married her.
