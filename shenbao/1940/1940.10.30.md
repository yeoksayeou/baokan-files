Chongqing – Today's military communiqué states that after a round of fierce fighting yesterday, Shaoxing was recovered. The Japanese army is currently retreating towards the mountains. According to Chinese authorities, they hope that Japanese forces in Guangxi and southwestern Guangdong will be completely driven out. Official sources believe that Japanese forces may be transferred to Hainan Island, as the winter climate is better there and supplies are more convenient. Once reorganized, they may attempt a new adventure in the Dutch East Indies. (Associated Press, 29th)

Chongqing – According to battle reports from the front lines of the Chinese army in southern Guangxi, after Chinese forces captured key strongholds outside Nanning in a general offensive, the vanguard has advanced to the outskirts of Nanning. The recovery of the city is imminent. The Chinese army in southern Guangxi launched a general offensive on October 23rd, surrounding Nanning from all sides. One column from Binyang attacked Santang, 10 miles north of Nanning, along the highway. Another column attacked from Jiandaoxu, east of Nanning. Chinese forces west of Nanning have already recovered Shibu. On October 25th, Japanese forces, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launched a fierce counterattack along the Wuming-Nanning highway, but were unable to stop the advance of the Chinese army. At the same time, Chinese forces on the south bank of the You River launched a general offensive on the Japanese forces occupying Longzhou area on the night of October 27th. After a night of fierce fighting, they completely recovered the city at 5:30 AM yesterday. Other Chinese columns also recovered Mingjiang and Suilu, key cities on the highway between Longzhou and Nanning. Chinese forces on the north bank of the You River are now approaching the outskirts of Nanning. Chinese forces on the west have cut off traffic between Nanning and the Vietnamese border. Other Chinese forces are threatening the highway between Nanning and the coast. Japanese forces in Nanning city are currently retreating, planning to reach the coast via Beihai and Qinzhou, fearing being completely surrounded by the Chinese army. All sectors of the Chinese community here are overjoyed at the imminent recovery of Nanning, as this will be the first provincial capital recovered in three years of fighting. This will boost the morale of the Chinese army and further strengthen the general public's confidence in the fighting power of the Chinese army. The Chinese victory in southern Guangxi will also create a good impression overseas, convincing the United Kingdom and the United States that the Chinese army is capable of dealing with the Japanese army, and their aid to China will certainly be more enthusiastic. According to sources here, once Nanning is recovered, the Burma Road and Kunming can be kept safe. Military experts believe that Yunnan province only fears an attack from the east, and now that the entire eastern wing is in the hands of the Chinese army, Yunnan province can rest easy. (Reuters, 29th)

Chongqing – Sources here claimed this morning that the Chinese army has won repeated victories and has recovered three other locations besides Nanning. Nanning is the largest city occupied by the Chinese army after its counteroffensive. The city fell on November 24th last year. It is understood that the Japanese army began to retreat when the Chinese army approached within artillery range of the city. It was announced here that Longzhou, Mingjiang, and Suilu have also been recovered by the Chinese army. It is reported that yesterday, when the Japanese army retreated to Fengshan, Zhennanguan, Ningming, and the Yong-Qin highway west of Nanning, the Chinese army attempted to pursue them. It is also reported that Japanese troops in various parts of southern Guangxi retreated at the same time. (Associated Press, 29th)

Chongqing – Regarding the Chinese army's great victory in southern Guangxi, experienced Chinese observers here recently stated that after Japanese forces entered Vietnam, they believed that China's external route had been cut off, and there was talk of abandoning Nanning. However, the Chinese army had already prepared to launch a timely counteroffensive, and recently launched an offensive with elite troops in separate directions, stepping up the pressure. One route pressed towards Nanning, fought fiercely for three days, and finally recovered it. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses. Another route advanced directly to Longzhou, northwest of Nanning, and also recovered it at the same time. Taking advantage of the victory, they also recovered Mingjiang and Suilu, north of Longzhou. In short, this decisive victory in southern Guangxi is of great significance. (Havas, 29th)

Hong Kong – Chinese sources here report that the Chinese army recovered Longzhou, Mingjiang, and Suilu in southwestern Guangxi province yesterday morning, and also won a decisive victory behind the Japanese forces slowly escaping from the southwestern Chinese encirclement. The old site of the Guangxi provincial government, Nanning, was previously recovered by the Chinese army after three days of fierce fighting, not long before the recovery of these three important cities. News from the wartime capital of China reaching here states that Chongqing considers the success of the Chinese army's recovery of past Japanese strongholds to be extremely important due to its strategic value. It is expected that the Chinese army will advance further south, as Japanese forces in southwestern China clearly want to abandon most of the strongholds they previously held. It is also reported that Chinese guerrillas in the Dongjiang area are preparing to launch a large-scale counteroffensive against Japanese forces in the southern section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. (International News, 29th)

Hong Kong – Military sources in Chongqing claimed yesterday that Nanning has been recovered after three days of fierce fighting. Observers believe this news is of great significance, as Nanning is the capital of Guangxi province, and the Japanese army occupied the city on January 24th, 1939, and is said to have heavily fortified it. At the same time, news received here states that Japanese troops who broke through the French forces in Xinyi (transliteration) did not return along the original route, but have withdrawn from Haiphong to Taiwan and are temporarily ceasing operations. According to Chinese sources, these Japanese troops were cut off by the Chinese army, but broke through the encirclement and entered Vietnam. Observers believe that the Chinese statement has been confirmed. (International News, 29th)

Chongqing – News of the Chinese army's recovery of Nanning has been informally confirmed. According to the initial Chinese reports, Chinese troops in southern Guangxi actively advanced along the highway from Binyang to Nanning, engaging in fierce fighting with Japanese forces and inflicting heavy damage. This morning, official sources here announced that the Chinese army has approached the outskirts of Nanning and the Japanese army has shown signs of retreat, advancing into the city and recovering it shortly thereafter. Subsequently, news was received that Mingjiang, northwest of Nanning, has also been recovered. (Havas, 29th)

### Japan's Southern Advance Policy Seems to Have Temporarily Halted, May Attempt to Invade Kunming from Vietnam, But Terrain Will Make It Very Difficult, Americans Express Joy at Chinese Army's Victory

Chongqing – Due to the resolute attitude expressed by the United States and the United Kingdom, Japan's southern advance appears to have temporarily halted. However, it is rumored that the Japanese may launch from Vietnam in an attempt to invade Kunming, so as to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road and threaten the southwestern provinces. Military experts believe that the Japanese invasion of Kunming will be very difficult due to the terrain and lack of convenient transportation. (Reuters, 29th)

Washington – The news of the Chinese army's victory in recovering Nanning from Chongqing, if confirmed, is considered by those familiar with Far Eastern affairs as an appropriate response to the Japanese claim that influential Chinese people are negotiating peace with Japan. Eastern news received here indicates that Japan is now extremely eager to find a suitable way to end the war in China, probably because it is shifting its speculative actions to the Indochina Peninsula, so as to obtain faster and more generous gains than it has gained in the three years of bloody battles in China, which have consumed manpower, financial resources and material resources, or because the strong attitude of the United States has forced Japan to concentrate its remaining forces in areas outside central China. News from Tokyo in the past few days has shown that Japan now knows that the United States is consistent in its words and deeds, and is not comparable to empty threats, and Japan's recent recall of its diplomatic representatives to the United States is also related to this. It is said here that the diplomatic representatives to the United States failed to accurately report the trends of American sentiment, such as newspapers and public opinion, to Nanjing, which is also one of the reasons for their withdrawal to their country. The trend of American sentiment does not change because of Japanese rhetoric, such as that of Suma, the spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Suma's derogatory remarks against President Roosevelt have had the opposite effect, causing undecided Americans to vote for those whom Japan does not want to be elected. Secretary of State Hull's remarks on Saturday are seen as confirming continued American aid to China, or that the US authorities may not take further action in the Far East immediately, but if Japan takes any aggressive steps, the United States will inevitably respond.

Editorial

### A Bird's-Eye View of the European Situation

A bird's-eye view of Europe can be broadly divided into three systems, that is, three forces. The first: the so-called "New European Order" of Germany and Italy, in Europe itself, is to thoroughly establish their hegemony: for all countries, large and small, they will be annexed, controlled, or conquered separately: without hesitating any means, they will create a European country that is completely suitable for their own intentions in politics, culture, economy, and even in the distribution of races. They absolutely negate the existence of all the situations created by the Treaty of Versailles; and their further attempt is that after defeating the European colonial countries, the ownership of their vast overseas colonies will also be transferred to Germany and Italy. The second: standing opposite to Germany and Italy, another group is implicitly formed, with Britain as the only current leader. The fundamental principle advocated by this group is to confirm the legitimate rights of the independent existence of more than 20 large and small countries in Europe since the Versailles Treaty; at the same time, it is of course insisted on the current situation of the distribution of overseas colonies; even if there is any unavoidable change, it is also advocated to be carried out within the scope of the League of Nations organization. The first is the Soviet Union, which dominates the north and looks down on the European continent. Its biggest premise is to ensure the existence and development of its own socialist system: therefore, its words and actions focus on encouraging all progressive forces internationally, abhorring stagnation, and opposing backsliding.

For more than a year, a large-scale war has been going on between the first and second forces: and at the same time, a diplomatic war is also going on between them and the third force. These are three intertwined into an overall. More analytically, Germany and Italy have two main goals on the mainland, (1) westward, to form a group of four countries, Germany, Italy, France and Spain, and (2) eastward, to completely annex the Balkan countries. The first goal takes the route of attracting France and Spain to join the German and Italian group, and aims to attack the Strait of Gibraltar via Spain, cross the Mediterranean Sea, and reach Africa all the way. Looking at the movements of Hitler, Mussolini, Laval, Franco and others in the past few days, it is enough to symbolize that the evolution of the first goal has reached the present. It is almost estimated that the future of this evolution is not a fundamental issue of success or failure, but a question of the degree of achievement; because what Germany and Italy are seeking from France is to hand over all the naval, land and air forces of France, which are now scattered in vast overseas colonies, to the disposal of Germany and Italy, as far as the power of the Vichy government can call, and become a part of the German and Italian war machine against the center. If Pétain does not accept it, Germany and Italy can make Laval replace Pétain. In short, there is no worry that the Vichy regime will not be driven. The problem is, in how many colonies are the naval, land and air forces willing to be called upon by Pétain or Laval. As for Spain, her problem is not whether to participate in the war or not, but how to avoid the lack of national economic and financial resources and the materials necessary for the daily life of the people caused by the blockade after participating in the war; if there are some remedies for the lack, it is the day when she follows Germany and Italy and participates in the war against Britain. However, when Germany and Italy impose severe pressure at any time and launch an offensive strategically, the scope that Franco can choose is very narrow.

As for the second goal, Germany and Italy's work of annexing the Balkans, the most obvious is first Germany's control of Romania, and now Italy's implementation of an attack on Greece, which is a naked and strong leap. Greece itself was originally not enough to protect itself, and the shrunken and cold declaration of "neutrality" by Yugoslavia and Bulgaria inevitably hit the morale of Greece. Therefore, Greece currently relies on Britain for its resistance; Britain must immediately send warships to seize the military ports of Crete, etc., and Salonica in advance, and send troops to land to block Germany and Italy's continued advance; but what is the benefit to the overall situation of Greece's resistance? We still have to wait for the facts to explain in the future. In addition, if Turkey immediately takes joint action with Britain and provides assistance, then the support for Greece's resistance war can almost be compared to everything.

On the British side, its diplomacy with European countries has lagged behind step by step and failed step by step. If the countries are used as units to compare the numbers, Britain is increasingly isolated; fortunately, the number of units is not the strength or weakness of the strength, so even if it is isolated, it does not become a reason for pessimism. Now it is also working on two objects: (1) to strengthen the British-American connection, and to complete its resistance to Germany and Italy with the ever-increasing assistance from the United States. (2) to gather its vast colonial potential forces into the British Empire's war machine and converge into a vast source with the times. Regarding the first object, it unexpectedly benefited from the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, because the American attitude became clearer and more active. Recently, a certain Italian newspaper angrily said that if it were not for the American aid to Britain, Britain's air force might have been destroyed: of course, the angry remarks cannot be accurate, but with the wealth of American resources and the strength of production, under the full determination to aid Britain, it can indeed enable the British air force to increase rapidly, and even can be said to enable Britain to last for a long time without being exhausted. This will undoubtedly be a decisive factor for the rise and fall of the situation of the competition for air supremacy between Britain and Germany. Regarding the second object, the recent meeting of the British-owned territories in the eastern hemisphere has its great significance of a hundred streams converging and ten thousand forces rushing.

Looking at the overall situation, today's Germany and Italy are like internal lines extending outwards, trying to open up a wider way out; while Britain, relying on its naval hegemony, has formed the largest encirclement of Germany and Italy. This is not the parallel opposition of two lines, but the inward and outward expansion of two circles. Without distinguishing between offense and defense, without distinguishing between the host and the guest, it is a desperate fight where the workers use all their strength and each uses all their strength.

As for the Soviet Union's attitude, until now. It is still silent. But forced by the general trend, silence also has its maximum limit; in the past, the European War for the Soviet Union was a fire outside the door, burning to the distance; but yesterday's Italian invasion of Greece, after affecting the Balkans, was a fire nearby burning to the door. Following this flame and wind, even if the Soviet Union is calm and wants to be silent, it cannot continue like this for a long time. Turkey is half a wall shielding it in between!

### Soviet-Japanese Treaty; Atmosphere Again Appears Ominous; Jianchuan Presents Credentials

While the Soviet Union in London is adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards the Balkan war, reliable sources arriving here say that Moscow is eager to conclude an agreement with Japan. Once the Soviet Union is relieved of pressure on its eastern border, it may be more at ease to deal with the Axis powers' threats to the Dardanelles and Turkey.

The agreement will also stipulate that the Soviet Union recognizes "Manchukuo," while Japan recognizes the Soviet Union's dominant position in "Outer Mongolia" and Xinjiang, and the right to station troops in these two regions. The long-standing Soviet-Japanese fishery dispute will also be resolved in this round of negotiations. However, the Soviet Union will reject Japan's requests to stop providing military aid to China and its proposal for a Soviet-Japanese partition of China.

### Roosevelt's Campaign Speech; Vigorously Defends National Defense Policy; Accuses Republicans of Lacking Foresight; The Precedent of France's Failure Serves as a Warning

New York, President Roosevelt last night at Madison Square Garden accused Republican leaders of lacking foresight on national defense issues. The President declared that the policies of responsible Republican leaders on national defense affairs are cowardly, weak, and shortsighted. It must be known that France's failure was the result of such cowardly and shortsighted policies, and England only realized the fallacy of this policy until the final period of crisis. The fact that the Republicans treated national defense issues as child's play in 1938 and 1939 is obvious. Even today, the party is still engaging in games on the issue of national security. The President also said that the Republicans' votes in Congress are tantamount to a work slowdown on the executive branch's continued efforts to increase national defense and deal with the unprecedented crisis. The President also accused former President Hoover, Senators Vandenberg and Taft, and Representative Fish, among other Republican leaders, of trying to obstruct the progress of national defense. The President also said that Republican campaign speakers have said that America's rearmament is too slow and incomplete and can never cope with foreign threats, and he only finds such remarks absurd. President Roosevelt's speech was broadcast nationwide. Before this important speech, the President made seven short speeches yesterday during an eight-hour journey by car from New York to northern New Jersey. In one of these speeches, the President told the people surrounding the car that his administration had built a navy capable of matching any country and an army and air force that America had only seen in peacetime.

Hanoi, three Thai bombers and eighteen fighter planes flew into Vietnam, circling over the airfield in Laos Province three times without dropping bombs. (29th Associated Press dispatch)

Hanoi, regarding the negotiations between French Vietnam and Thailand, the Thai government is currently insisting that the joint committee of both parties, in addition to handling the issue of demarcating the new border along the Mekong River, should also have the power to study Thailand's claims to the land on the right bank of the Mekong River. Therefore, the negotiations have made no progress. However, no new disputes have occurred in the border area for some time. Thailand's military deployments are still in progress, and the entire border between the country and Vietnam has been blockaded. Telegraphic communication on both sides of the Mekong River has also been interrupted in several places. At the same time, a fierce anti-French movement is underway in Thailand. Generally speaking, the situation has not deteriorated. The United States' refusal to lend money to Thailand and its ban on the export of arms to the country may have an impact on the future situation. (28th Havas dispatch)

Athens, this morning, the Greek Ministry of Public Security issued a statement stating that as a result of the Italian plane bombing of Patras, more than 100 Greek people were injured and more than 50 were killed. The reason why there were so many casualties was that the people did not go to the air raid shelters to hide, and some even climbed to the roofs to watch the air combat. In the future, it is hoped that the people will be vigilant and will not make unnecessary sacrifices. (29th Haitong dispatch)

### Italian Side Declares Greece Will Be Occupied Within Three Weeks

Rome, well-informed military circles here recently stated that regardless of whether Greece allows the cession of territory, Italy's occupation of Greece will be completed within three weeks. The so-called three-week period is set aside for whether Britain will implement intervention. It is also stated that if any other country in the Mediterranean, such as Turkey, rises up to fight and help Greece, Germany will immediately intervene. Whether the negotiations between Hitler and Mussolini yesterday included such an agreement is unknown, but well-informed sources believe it may have happened. However, officials here recently formally announced that the two sides' views have reached complete agreement on yesterday's Hitler-Mussolini meeting. Diplomatic circles believe that if the Italian-Greek war requires the implementation of the Tripartite Pact, then Japan will also be drawn into the war against Greece before the Italian-Greek issue reaches a peaceful resolution. The acceleration of offensives on all fronts, from the air raids on Britain to the attack on Egypt, is also recognized by diplomatic circles as continuing. Furthermore, military officials said that at dawn tomorrow, Italy's entire operational machinery, including the parachute troops, will be mobilized to occupy the Greek islands. Observers here are speculating a lot about the Hitler-Mussolini meeting. The official communique only stated that all the issues discussed at the meeting had reached a complete understanding.

### Talks Between German and Italian Leaders: Full Understanding Reached on Various Issues; Roman Newspapers Claim Meeting Concerned the Future of European Politics; Hitler Left Florence for Germany That Evening

After holding important talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Florence yesterday, German Führer Hitler immediately returned to his country by special train at 6 PM. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ciano also swiftly returned to Rome. (Havas News Agency, 29th)

The official announcement from Rome stated that Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini reached a full understanding on the many issues discussed during their meeting in Florence yesterday. The official announcement claimed that the Führer and the Prime Minister spoke for several hours, demonstrating the spirit and sincerity of their alliance, and fully agreed on their views on all current issues. The announcement also stated that the Foreign Ministers of Germany and Italy, Ciano and Ribbentrop, attended the meeting. Hitler and Mussolini began their talks at 11 AM and concluded at 2 PM. (United Press, 29th)

An editorial written by Baloni, editor of the Roman newspaper "Il Popolo di Roma," stated that the Florence meeting was unique. Previous meetings between German and Italian leaders focused on military matters, but this time the discussions were closely related to the future of European politics. The main issue at present is the need for a clear division between the European continent and Britain. Countries leaning towards Britain should not be allowed to have a foothold on the continent. Once this "scorched earth" policy is completed, Britain will find it difficult to resist attacks from the Axis powers in the long term. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

The semi-official German "Diplomatische Korrespondenz" commented on the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, stating that nothing could prevent the realization of the Axis powers' plan to establish a united group of European countries participating in the progressive movement. The complete removal of British influence from the European continent is a necessary prelude to the reconstruction of Europe. If we find any base that could be used by Britain's dangerous institutions anywhere, it must be eradicated for the sake of Europe's interests. (Reuters, 29th)

According to news from Florence, New York, Hitler and Mussolini met in Florence yesterday to discuss an agreement to reduce Italy's territorial demands on France in exchange for French warships to be used in attacks. (Reuters, 29th)

Regarding the meeting of Axis leaders in Florence, Berlin, German authorities announced yesterday afternoon that, following the meetings between Führer Hitler and Franco, Pétain, and Laval, Hitler's meeting with Mussolini to discuss recent developments was inevitable. The date of this meeting, occurring at a time of extreme activity for the Axis powers' military and political affairs, and also coinciding with the 18th anniversary of the Fascist Party's rule, shows its importance. Berlin did not release the content of the talks, stating that it would be published in the official gazette at a later date. Previous statements had repeatedly stated that the Axis powers' goal was to create a new cooperative Europe. The issues discussed at the Brenner Pass must have been reviewed again at this meeting. The official side called the French peace terms reported by the American press fabricated, but remained silent on the content of the Franco-German talks. Berlin officials did not comment on the Italo-Greek situation yesterday, but said that Greece's pro-British stance was intolerable. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### Turkish Prime Minister Declares Resolve to Maintain Independence; Remains Neutral on Italo-Greek War; Turkish Military Representative Arrives in Athens

Ankara: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam, in a nationwide broadcast, without directly mentioning the situation in Greece, stated that the dangers we face are increasing, but a mature and noble sense of unity is the strongest weapon to defend our security. Turkey has firm faith in its own strength and will not hesitate to defend its independence. We are now stronger and more confident than ever before. (Reuters, 29th)

Ankara: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam made a firm official indication here yesterday that Turkey will remain neutral in the Italo-Greek war. The Prime Minister hinted in his address commemorating the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic that Turkey will not be involved in the current crisis. The Prime Minister did not even mention Greece in his address, but emphasized the "happiness of peace." Political observers here are awaiting Saydam's speech with keen interest, as this is the first statement by a senior Turkish government official since the invasion of Greece. It is believed that Saydam's remarks will indicate Turkey's intention to respect its mutual aid agreement with Greece, which stipulates that the two countries should help each other if either is attacked. (International Telegram, 29th)

Ankara: The Turkish Broadcasting Station announced the news of Italy's ultimatum to Greece at 7 AM yesterday morning. News that Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas rejected the Italian ultimatum and that Italian troops had entered Greece has caused alarm in Turkey, as Turkey has obligations to Britain under the treaty. As of noon yesterday, Turkey had not shown any signs of pro-Greek intervention. Diplomatic circles here are confident that Turkey has a well-thought-out plan and will maintain a defensive position when the Italo-Greek war breaks out. It is generally expected that Turkey's attitude towards the new situation in the Balkans will soon be revealed. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Chief of Staff of British Near East Forces Arrives in Ankara

Ankara: General Smith, Chief of Staff of the British Near East Forces, arrived here from Cairo. Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff General Gündüz also visited Athens. This is seen here as a sign of political change. Diplomatic circles believe that Turkey will only express its attitude towards the Italo-Greek dispute after the National Day celebrations and when the situation in Greece becomes clearer. It is reported that Major General Smith's visit is a unilateral action by Britain and does not indicate a change in Turkey's attitude. According to parliamentarians, Turkey will only react when attacked. Therefore, Major General Smith's visit is merely a return visit to Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff General Gündüz's visit to Cairo a few months ago. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Ankara: According to information received here, General Smith, Chief of Staff of the British Near East Forces, has already left for Ankara and will meet with the Chief of Staff of the Turkish Army. It is also learned that the Turkish military delegation has arrived in the capital of Greece. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

London: Britain and Turkey are currently discussing the Italo-Greek situation through normal diplomatic channels. There is no news here about Germany and the Soviet Union's current attitude. Rumors that British troops have landed in Kefalonia, Crete, and Thessaloniki are completely confirmed. (Reuters, 29th)

Istanbul: Britain and Turkey are currently discussing what position Turkey should take in the Italo-Greek war in accordance with the treaty recently signed between the two countries. Although Turkey has no obligation to help Greece, it is said that Greece deeply hopes that Turkey will rise up to help Greece when it defends its country. Therefore, it is essential for Turkey to maintain a strong position in Thrace. Greece does not need land assistance, but it needs naval assistance, but it is difficult for Turkey to provide it. (Reuters, 29th)

### Greek Prime Minister and Turkish President Have Long Phone Conversation

Athens: Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas had a 15-minute telephone conversation with Turkish President İsmet last night. The content of the conversation is kept secret. According to well-informed sources, Metaxas met with the British, Turkish, and Yugoslavian envoys yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### Bulgaria Declares Neutrality

Sofia: Political circles here declared yesterday that Bulgaria will closely monitor the Italo-Greek war but will not interfere. Since the King mentioned in Parliament yesterday that Bulgaria would maintain friendly relations with its neighbors, it is generally believed that the King's intention included Greece. However, it is difficult to say whether Bulgaria can maintain this attitude if Turkey joins the war on the British side. According to news received here, the Bulgarian-Greek border is very stable, and Bulgaria has not taken any border defense measures. However, the air route between Sofia and Athens has now been suspended. Bulgarian newspapers today carry reports on the Greek war, stating that Greece's pro-British stance has forced Italy to use force strategically. The newspapers claim that, in any case, Bulgaria will protect its independence and interests and urge the people to be more vigilant. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### German Light Bombers Raid England

Berlin: German light bombers continued to raid London yesterday afternoon, dropping many bombs on railway stations and factories. They engaged in fierce battles with British fighter planes, shooting down two British planes. One German plane is missing. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

London: According to official announcements, one German bomber was destroyed on Monday night. German aircraft activity covered several areas, but London and the Midlands remained the main targets. An Air Ministry communique said that German aircraft began attacking after dusk, but the intensity subsided by this morning. Several houses, shops, and other buildings were destroyed in the London area, and several fires broke out, but they were quickly extinguished. A large number of incendiary bombs were dropped on a city in the Midlands, causing many fires, but casualties were minor. Enemy aircraft activity was also detected in the southeast and northeast of England, but damage was minor and casualties were very few. (Reuters, 29th)

### US Expresses Sympathy for Greece

Washington: The Greek envoy to the United States visited the State Department yesterday afternoon and was received by Undersecretary of State Welles. The envoy told reporters that the King and government of Greece were doing their best to restore normalcy in the country and hoped that the United States would express sympathy for the situation in their country. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### British Naval Chief Announces British Navy Has Been Mobilized to Aid Greece; British King and Prime Minister Send Telegrams to Greece Guaranteeing Full Assistance

London: Naval Minister Alexander announced today that British naval assistance to Greece has begun. He said, "I can assure Greece and the United States that the British Navy will do its utmost to help Greece. Mussolini's aggression against Greece is nothing less than a repeat of the attack on Britain from behind in June of this year. The British Navy has achieved great success in the Mediterranean and Red Sea in recent months, sinking a large number of enemy submarines and destroying many destroyers and cruisers." (Reuters, 29th)

London: The British King sent a telegram to King George II of Greece and the Greek people, stating, "The current trial is very difficult, but we all accept it with a firm belief in ultimate victory. We hope that the tide will turn and the moment of the aggressor's failure is gradually approaching." (Reuters, 29th)

London: Prime Minister Churchill sent a telegram to Greek Prime Minister Metaxas yesterday, strongly encouraging Greece and firmly guaranteeing that Britain would be able to provide assistance. Churchill said in the telegram, "We will give you as much assistance as we can. We are fighting the same enemy and will share the victory together in the future. Italy has repeatedly threatened you without effect, so they have launched an invasion against your country on the pretext of unfounded accusations. Under your leadership, your people have recently disregarded the enemy's threats. This spirit has been envied by the enemy. I am confident that you will be able to weather the crisis with the same spirit." Diplomatic circles here have paid close attention to the situation in the Balkans in the past 24 hours, paying attention to Turkey's possible actions, according to the most well-informed sources. Turkey's current actions may only be trying to put pressure on Yugoslavia to demobilize to prevent it from joining the attack on Greece. Diplomatic observers solemnly stated last night that the Balkan Pact originally stipulated that Turkey should provide military assistance to Greece to resist an attack by Yugoslavia because Yugoslavia is a Balkan country. However, the agreement does not clearly stipulate military assistance in the event of an attack on Greece by a non-Balkan country. (United Press, 29th)

London: The British envoy to Greece was instructed by London to clearly state to Prime Minister Metaxas that Britain will provide Greece with all possible assistance to help it resist the Italian invasion. A Reuters reporter learned from the Turkish Embassy in London that the Turkish Embassy had received information that Turkey and Italy are now in a state of war. The British are very pleased with Greece's position and will provide the fullest possible assistance in accordance with the guarantee conditions. It goes without saying that when the British Prime Minister announced this guarantee in the House of Commons last April 13, he stated that the British government regarded the non-disturbance of the status quo in the Mediterranean and the Balkans as the most important event. Before invading Greece, Italy deliberately spread rumors that groups of Greek refugees attacked Italian border outposts, causing many deaths and injuries, and that British or Greek people were trying to cause explosions at a certain port in Albania. In fact, these rumors are completely unfounded and have been firmly denied by the Greek government. Italy wants to send troops to invade Greece and break the guarantee it gave to Greece a year ago, so it first makes false accusations. This trick cannot escape the observation of the world. (Reuters, 29th)

### Content of Italy's Ultimatum to Greece: Demands Occupation of Strategic Locations

Rome: Italian envoy to Greece, Grazzi, presented a note to the Greek government at 3 AM yesterday, stating that the Italian government has repeatedly found that the attitude adopted by the Greek government in the current European war not only violates the peaceful, friendly, and good-neighborly relations between Italy and Greece, but also violates the Greek government's obligations to remain neutral. The Greek government has allowed the British fleet to use Greek territorial waters, coasts, and ports during combat, and has provided food supplies to the British Air Force, and has allowed British military intelligence personnel to operate in Greece, causing damage to Italy. The Italian government has been repeatedly forced to ask the Greek government to fulfill its obligations, and has repeatedly protested against the Greek government's measures that violate its obligations. The Greek government is well aware of this situation and has repeatedly become the subject of Italian diplomatic action. The Greek government also understands the serious consequences of its attitude and has not responded with any measures to protect its neutrality, but has instead intensified its actions, assisting the British army, and cooperating with the Italian enemy. Italy has evidence that the Greek government knows of this cooperation, and the method of cooperation is stipulated by agreements between the army, navy, and air force. The Italian government does not mention here that Greece accepted the British guarantee, and regards it as part of a plan aimed at Italian security. The Italian government only states the Greek government's clear responsibility to provide strategic locations in Greece, including airfields in Thessaly and Macedonia that can attack Albania, to countries at war with Italy. The Italian government must remind the Greek government of Greece's provocative actions against Albania, the implementation of terrorist policies against the residents of Samaria, and attempts to create unrest outside the border. Regarding this incident, the Italian government has been forced to inform the Greek government of the inevitable consequences of this anti-Italian policy. Italy can no longer tolerate it. Greece's neutrality is becoming increasingly hypocritical. The responsibility for this situation should be borne by Britain, which hopes to involve various countries in the war. The current Greek policy is tending to turn Greek territory into a base for belligerent actions against Italy, or at least has allowed this transformation. This policy will cause military conflict between Italy and Greece. Italy has tried its best to avoid military conflict. Therefore, the Italian government has decided to ask the Greek government to allow Italian troops to occupy Greek strategic locations during Italy's war against Britain, as a complete guarantee for Italy. The Italian government asks the Greek government not to oppose this occupation, and not to obstruct the troops occupying strategic locations. Italian troops are not enemies of the Greek people. The Italian government has no intention of affecting Greek sovereignty and independence with the temporary occupation of strategic locations, which is purely defensive in nature due to the needs of the situation. The Italian government asks the Greek government to immediately issue the necessary orders to the military authorities to allow Italian troops to carry out the occupation peacefully. If Italian troops encounter resistance, they will use force to break this resistance, and the Greek government should also bear the responsibility for all losses. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### US Naval Officers Ordered to Concentrate Residence; All Personnel Residing in French Concession Must Move Out; Families to Depart on December 3

According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," this morning (29th), it was learned that officers of the 4th US Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai have received orders stating that all those residing in the French Concession and other parts of the city must move into the "area" bounded by Foch Road, Jiaozhou Road, Seymour Road, and Haifang Road.

New Restrictions Facilitate Assembly

It is also disclosed that in the future, US troops stationed in Shanghai will not be allowed to stay outside the new "area" after midnight. At the same time, it is heard that US troops stationed in Shanghai are now allowed to prepay three months' salary so that they can send it to their families in the country. It is believed that the implementation of this new restriction by the 4th Marine Regiment is aimed at making it easier to summon all officers and soldiers when necessary.

Family Evacuation Arrangements Completed

In addition, the families of US Marine Corps personnel here are expected to evacuate Shanghai entirely by mid-December. It is heard that arrangements for their evacuation have been completed. The first batch will leave Shanghai on the President Monde on December 3, and the rest will depart on the Mariposa in mid-December.

The ship will remain in Shanghai until December 21, when it will set sail for Manila, where it is expected to arrive on the 23rd, and will leave on the 25th, arriving in Los Angeles on December 8.

Oil Tankers Sailing to Singapore Completely Baseless

According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," rumors that the Asia Petroleum Company's oil tankers and inland river vessels currently sailing between Shanghai and North China are scheduled to withdraw from Shanghai and return to Singapore next week have been denied by a senior official of the Asia Petroleum Company. It is said that this statement is actually inaccurate. The company originally had several ships docked in this port and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Several of them were requisitioned by the British government last year.

### American Community Fetes Two Consuls; Farewell to the Old and Welcome the New; Acting Consul to Return to America

It is reported that Locke Hart had previously been stationed in various parts of China several times.

### Public Rice Sale to Be Held the Day After Tomorrow; Rice Price Evaluation Temporarily Postponed Due to Current Market Price Being Lower Than Production Cost

To stabilize the entire rice market in Shanghai, the Rice Price Evaluation Committee held its eleventh standing committee meeting at its office yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. Seventeen committee members attended, and representatives from both the foreign settlements and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce were delegated to attend and provide guidance. Zhang Nianxuan was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, and he reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the current market price of foreign rice has already fallen by five yuan per dan (unit of weight) compared to the production cost, seemingly making an evaluation unnecessary. However, in accordance with the wishes of the foreign settlement authorities, the price of foreign rice should also be evaluated based on production cost. Subsequently, Fu Qiangeng, Zhu Zixiang, and others stood up and made suggestions separately, and then a discussion began. The result of the discussion was that the current market price is lower than the production cost, and if the instructions of the foreign settlement authorities are followed, adding profit and loss would greatly exceed the market price. Therefore, only the current production cost and market conditions can be reported to the two settlements for their review. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.

Urging Orders

According to the Rice Price Evaluation Committee's statement yesterday, it hopes that all sectors will not stand idly by and will quickly participate in group orders of foreign rice. Although the current rice market situation in Shanghai appears to be stable on the surface, in this volatile international situation, if the source of foreign rice is interrupted, rice prices will inevitably rise again. The committee will also strongly encourage all industry members to take advantage of the current long-term foreign exchange policy and low production cost of foreign rice to place large orders to prepare for any emergency. However, the requirement that each bag requires a prepayment of forty yuan in national currency from the purchaser is felt to be burdensome given the unrecovered economic hardship of the people. It is hoped that this can be reduced or that other guarantee methods can be devised. In addition, the Ningbo Native Place Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss methods for fellow villagers to purchase rice as a group.

Seventh Phase of Public Rice Sale

The Public Rice Sale Committee issued its seventh public notice yesterday, stating: "For public notice, it is hereby announced that the seventh phase of the public rice sale will be held from November 1st, continuing the previous method. The Rice Merchants Association is still entrusted to designate sixty member rice stores in the two foreign settlements to handle the public sale, including thirty-six in the International Settlement, with eighteen selling tickets and eighteen distributing rice, and twenty-four in the French Concession, with twelve selling tickets and twelve distributing rice. The Rice Merchants Association has already designated these stores, and they will open on time. Rice purchasers must purchase rice in accordance with the regulations and must not rush or squeeze. In addition to reporting to the authorities of the two foreign settlements to instruct the police to assist in maintaining order and protecting the public, this notice is hereby given. (Names of ticket-selling and rice-distributing stores omitted.)"

### New Loans Released at the End of the Month: Over Ten Million Yuan; Old Customers Granted Loans Appropriately to Avoid Idle Consumption of Interest

Tomorrow is the last day of the month for Shanghai's industry and commerce, the only general closing period for long-term monthly settlements. It is learned that new credit loans amounted to more than 100,000 yuan, which is more than the mid-month closing in the first half of the year. This is mainly due to the sharp increase in deposits in various banks and firms, which necessitated granting appropriate loans to reliable old customers to avoid idle consumption of interest. However, most require reliable guarantors. Regarding the overall financial market, due to frequent reports of victories from the front lines, the black market foreign exchange rate for HSBC has lengthened, and the black market price of silver dollars has increased but remains stable as usual. The interbank lending rate remains at the original price of 12%, and there is no emergency in the money market. There is no problem in safely passing through the end of the month.

### Japanese Troops Spying on Cao'e Intercepted; They Have Collapsed Towards Doumen; The Situation in Shaoxing and Zhuji Remains Unchanged; The Situation on the East Bank of the Cao'e River Has Become More Stable

The Zhejiang Provincial Association in Shanghai received the following telegram from eastern Zhejiang yesterday: "(1) The Japanese troops who crossed Keqiao and attacked Shaoxing City are a small force of more than 100 men who sneaked into the Shaoxing urban area from the southeast suburbs. Fierce street fighting immediately broke out, and a fire broke out in the city, which lasted until the 27th and has now been extinguished. The material losses were quite significant. The Japanese troops in the city yesterday (the 20th) morning again exited the Wuyun Gate to the east, occupied Donghu Villa, and then sneaked to the Chebu Fanjiang area, causing the situation between Baiguan and Cao'e to suddenly become tense. After being intercepted by strong troops, they have collapsed towards Doumen. The situation on the east bank of the Cao'e River has stabilized. The Japanese troops within Shaoxing are exhausted and there are no drastic changes. (2) According to military news, the Japanese troops in Gaobu, east of Shaoxing, are collapsing westward towards Doumen. There are currently no unexpected drastic changes in the Zhuji area. (3) The more than 1,000 Japanese troops who are roaming on the right flank, including the more than 100 who sneaked into Shaoxing City, are trapped in a corner and are difficult to develop. (4) The number of Japanese troops invading Shaoxing is small, and large forces have arrived at the front line one after another. It will not be difficult to resolve the situation in the shortest possible time. Currently, the city's telephone lines have been interrupted, and the situation is unclear. The Chinese army is attacking in the rain."

### It is Rumored that the Shanghai Consular Body Will Convene a Meeting Next Week; The Vacant Position of Head Consul Will Be Appointed; This Meeting is Likely a Factor in Stabilizing Shanghai

All facilities of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement are based on the resolutions of the annual meeting of taxpayers as the warp, and the instructions of the Consular Body as the weft. It is an absolute representation of the legal interests of various countries and the highest administrative body of the municipality where taxpayers enjoy their rights. Recently, the situation in Shanghai has become tense due to the turbulence of the international crisis. Some aspects of the Municipal Council's measures cannot be compared with the past. Impartial people from all countries share this sentiment and hope that the situation can be changed as soon as possible and that the general situation in this port can be stabilized. After the diplomatic personnel of the countries concerned were transferred to Shanghai, this wish was sincerely felt. If there is a harmonious feeling in the Consular Body, the Municipal Council will naturally receive assistance and increase its administrative efficiency.

New American and French Consuls; Important Responsibilities

Recently, the consuls of the United States and France have been replaced. The new American Consul Lockhart and the French Consul General Magere have arrived in Shanghai one after another. All parties are paying close attention to the position and stance of the American Consul. There have been some unfounded rumors in the French Concession in the past few weeks. Mr. Mage, when he first arrived, should calm everything down to comfort the people's expectations. Therefore, the significance of the arrival of the two new consuls in Shanghai this time is not just a transfer of diplomatic personnel from their respective countries.

Convening a Meeting to Discuss Everything

It is now heard that the Shanghai Consular Body will convene a consular meeting next week to seek to connect the feelings between the consuls and to discuss the general situation in Shanghai. It is heard that one of the most important points is to re-elect the Head Consul, because the original Head Consul, Italian Consul Niron, has been transferred to another position. This position is still vacant. As for other matters, some discussions may also be held to adapt to the current environment in Shanghai. It is believed that this meeting is a factor in stabilizing the overall situation in Shanghai, so it is given great importance.

### Zhuang Songfu Died of Illness in Fenghua

Zhuang Songfu, also known as Zhuang Jingzhong, was naturally gifted and physically strong. In his youth, he was a student and a farmer, offering advice. As he grew older, he absorbed new knowledge and worked for the revolution. Dr. Sun Yat-sen regarded him as a comrade, and his circle of friends expanded. He established new academic societies, associations, and bookstores (now the China Agricultural Bookstore) on Jiaotong Road in this port. In addition to writing, he served as a vanguard of the revolution with martyrs such as Chen Yingchi and Huang Yingbai. After the Xinhai Revolution, he achieved his long-cherished ambition and was appointed as the Director of Finance of Zhejiang Province and the Director of the Salt Administration Bureau, eliminating long-standing malpractices and ensuring a clean officialdom. After the success of the Northern Expedition, he served as a member of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government and the Deputy Director of the Huai River Water Conservancy Commission. He was able to implement what he said and could be emulated. Even European and American experts could not challenge him. After the September 18th Incident, the project of diverting the Huai River into the sea was greatly hindered, and he began to show signs of fatigue. He traveled around eastern and western Zhejiang, and wherever he went, he did his best to promote industry, water conservancy, supervision, encouragement, and rewards. He also implicitly taught the meaning of concentrating strength. After the August 13th Incident, he returned to his hometown of Fenghua, managing the Linmu Company and living in seclusion, worrying about national affairs. His health deteriorated due to illness. Last summer, the Zhejiang Provincial Senate was established, and the central government hired him to serve as a senator, but he declined due to old age. In November of winter, it was his 80th birthday. Chairman Lin, President Chiang, Dean Kong, and others all presented plaques with inscriptions such as "Distinguished Elder of the Party and the State," "Respected for Virtue and Morality," and "Noble Character of Loshe" to show their respect. President Chiang also inscribed his residence as "Nanyang Xiaozhu". At that time, his health was already poor, and he died of illness on the 24th of this month at Qiuwo Cottage in Caocun, Fenghua, at the age of 81. A veteran and old star suddenly returned to seclusion. What a sorrow!

### Germany: Oil Panic; Statement by the Manager of the Dutch Oil Company

A foreign businessman in this port received a letter from London yesterday from Mr. Keeslow, manager of the Royal Dutch Oil Company, stating that the biggest panic currently felt in Germany is oil. The original letter stated that if Germany launches a large-scale offensive recently, a serious oil panic will inevitably occur within six months. According to rough calculations, Germany needs 20 million tons of oil per year for small-scale military operations and to maintain civilian use in the occupied areas. However, the Axis countries, if they reorganize the inferior oil transported from Romania, can obtain 4 million tons of oil per year. German mines produce 1 million tons of oil. The total amount of synthetic products from Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland is 4 million tons per year, and Estonia produces 1 million tons. The three countries of Italy, Switzerland, and France total 5 million tons. Therefore, if a large-scale general offensive is launched, Germany will still be short of 10 million tons of oil per year. As for the point of Soviet aid to Germany, even if the Soviet Union is willing to transport goods to Germany, given the current capacity of the refineries and the inconvenience of transportation, large-scale transportation may have to be delayed for several years. Currently, the Soviet Union only transports a small amount of lubricating oil, kerosene, and unrefined crude oil to Germany.

### The Public in Chongqing and Kunming are Not Afraid of Air Raids; Morale is High and Attitude is Calm; The Chinese Section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is Being Demolished Sequentially; American Reporter Returns to Shanghai from a Southern Tour and Talks About His Impressions of the Trip

The English-language Great Evening News reported that Steel, a Far East reporter for the Chicago Daily News, recently returned to Shanghai after touring the "emergency" areas of southern China for two months. This morning (the 29th), he told reporters about the situation in Kunming, Chongqing, and the border between French Indochina, saying that although Kunming and Chongqing have suffered repeated air raids, morale is high and the public generally regards air raids as a daily occurrence, and the preventive measures are now very effective, so the number of casualties is very small.

Damage in Kunming Is Not Serious

The claim in recent telegrams to Chongqing that "Kunming was razed to the ground by a squadron of Japanese bombers on October 13" is an exaggeration. Although the damage caused by the air raid was not minor, Kunming was far from destroyed. The cultural district of the city, including Yunnan University, suffered heavy damage, but the number of military targets of importance that were destroyed was also very small. Seventeen Japanese aircraft participated in the raid and dropped more than 100 bombs, including those weighing 1,000 pounds. Steel stayed in Kunming for a week and then stayed in Chongqing for a week, encountering air raids twice. The morale of the capital was very high. The air raid alarms gave the public ample time to take cover, so the casualties were light. Steel said that during the air raids, he saw that the public showed no signs of surprise and were all calm as usual.

The Burma Road Cannot Be Destroyed

Regarding the Vietnamese border, Steel said that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which connects Lao Cai and Kunming and is about 290 miles long, is now being dismantled by Chinese technicians at a rate of one kilometer per day to prevent the Japanese army from spying on Yunnan along this line. The railway passes through mountains and forests. Once the railway is destroyed, it will be extremely difficult for the Japanese army to invade. As for the Burma Road, which runs 740 miles from Lashio to Kunming, it is not easy to destroy it and render it useless due to its location.

### French Ambassador Cosme Still Stationed in the Capital; Shanghai Office Prepares to Move to Peiping; Archives and Documents Being Sorted

The Shanghai office of the French Embassy in China, located at No. 2 Avenue Joffre in this port, will soon move back to Beiping after receiving orders to relocate. Recently, the office staff have been actively sorting out all archives and documents in order to transport them by boat to Tianjin and then to Beiping. Apart from Ambassador Cosme's wife and two daughters who have already left Shanghai for Beiping, the date of his departure to the north is still uncertain. However, it is understood that he will leave for Beiping as soon as the preparations are completed. As for Ambassador Cosme, since leaving Shanghai and flying to Vietnam and then to Chongqing, he is currently staying in the capital, in close contact with the central authorities, and plans to become a long-term resident of Chongqing.

### Qian Rende and a Dancer Double Report Poisoning

Qian Rende, a 28-year-old from Ningbo, lives at No. 23 Avenue Albert, French Concession, and works as a clerk at the Yongming Life Insurance Company at No. 218 North Sichuan Road. After work, he enjoys visiting dance halls. Several months ago, he fell in love with Zhang Meina (20 years old, from Ningbo), a dancer at the Lido Dance Hall, who lives at No. 35 Yongnian Lane, Route Cardinal Mercier. Subsequently, a physical relationship developed. Recently, Zhang Meina stopped dancing because she was three months pregnant, but Qian Rende also felt very sorry for Zhang and planned to marry her. Unexpectedly, Qian's wife strongly opposed it, and it could not become a reality. Qian immediately had the idea of ending his life. Yesterday afternoon at about 6:00 p.m., he went to Zhang Meina's place and took her to the Continental Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, booking room 504. After paying the room fee, they closed the door and went to bed. At about 10:00 p.m., the waiter heard moaning sounds from the room and was very surprised. He went to knock on the door, but there was no response. He found a way to pry open the door and saw the man and woman lying on the bed, their faces pale. An empty bottle of poisonous liquid was on the table, indicating that they had committed suicide by taking poison. He quickly called an ambulance to send the two to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is said that both of them were deeply poisoned, and there may be a danger to their lives.

### A Kidnapping Case Occurred on Dongyouheng Road Last Night; The Kidnapped Person Was the Owner of the Dalun Silk Weaving Factory; The Carjacking Case Seems to Be Related to the Kidnapping

Gu Jinhui, also known as Hongpei, a 50-year-old from Suzhou, founded the Dalun Silk Weaving Factory at No. 79, Lane 1143 (i.e., Rongchang Lane), Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou. Gu and his family lived upstairs in the factory. Yesterday at about 7:00 p.m., suddenly

Eight kidnappers broke into the factory. Six of the kidnappers were wearing suits, and two were wearing blue cloth short shirts. They took out guns and threatened the factory staff, prohibiting them from making any noise. The kidnappers went upstairs and ran into Gu's bedroom. Without asking any questions, they forced Gu out of the room. Gu resisted slightly, and the kidnappers

Threatened him with a gun, and Gu did not dare to disobey and had to let the kidnappers take him downstairs and out. When they reached the alley entrance, the kidnappers pushed him into a taxi that was parked on the side of the road (number unknown). The kidnappers also boarded the car one after another, and one of them drove away at full speed. Afterwards, the family reported to the police station in charge, and they sent detectives to investigate. It is heard that about an hour before the case occurred, a Ningbo Road Meihua Motor Company

A taxi (No. 17820) was passing through the intersection of Zhoujiazui Road and Baoding Road in Hongkou when three bandits suddenly used guns to force the driver Zhang Baosheng to stop. Zhang had no choice but to stop. After the three bandits got into the car, one of them drove away. As of midnight last night, the driver and the car had not been found. As for whether the car used by the kidnappers was the car that the three bandits had carjacked, it has not been confirmed.

### The 240,000 Yuan Leather Clothing Case; Witnesses Were Interrogated Yesterday; The Situation is Complex and Detailed Inquiries Lasted One Hour; The Court Ordered Further Investigation and Rescheduled the Hearing

Zhou Meiyihui (57 years old this year), a wealthy widow from Jiangxi who lives at No. 20, Lane 1400, Avenue Haig, Public Concession, was recently sued by Zhou Pengling (22 years old this year), the cousin of her deceased husband Zhou Zishan, through lawyer Shan Yuhua, to the First Special Court's Civil Division, requesting a judgment to return 23 boxes of leather clothing worth 240,000 yuan in national currency. Judge Guo has summoned her several times, and because the case is complex and important, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled

Call Witnesses for Questioning

Judge Guo opened the Civil Division Two courtroom again yesterday afternoon to hear the case. Shan Yuhua, the lawyer representing the plaintiff Zhou Pengling, first presented the ledger of the leather boxes stored at the defendant Zhou Mei's house. Judge Guo immediately questioned the witness Peng Boqian based on this. He asked if the ledger was recorded by them at the beginning. Peng read it for a long time and testified to the court that it was written by the witness and Zhou. According to Zhou Weibin, who also testified, he had written a letter at the instruction of lawyer Peng

Explain in the Letter

The method of resolving the leather clothing worth 20,000 yuan stored at Zhou Zishan's place, but he did not know how many boxes or how many pieces of leather clothing it referred to, because the witness was in a very bad situation at the time, his house was sealed, and he was mentally confused. The court then asked the defendant Zhou Mei how many boxes the plaintiff had actually stored at her place. According to Zhou Mei's lawyer, there were actually 39 boxes, excluding 18 boxes of leather clothing as collateral for Zhou Zishan's debt of more than 23,000 taels to the Yu Da Money Shop on behalf of the plaintiff's deceased father in 1927. The plaintiff took away 13 boxes

Auctioned Eight Boxes

The plaintiff himself and the lawyer then said to the court that there were actually 23 boxes of leather clothing stored at the defendant's place. The defendant said that there were only 18 boxes of leather clothing, which was inconsistent. The plaintiff's claim that he took 43 boxes and auctioned 8 boxes were not within the original 39 boxes stored at the defendant's place. The items originally stored at the defendant's place were all recorded in the ledger that the presiding judge just gave to the witness Peng Boqian and was proven to be written by Peng et al. There are lot numbers to check. According to the representative of Tian Yushu, the manager of Yu Da Money Shop, who brought the ledger from 1927

Testified to the Court

Zhou Zishan had repaid more than 30,000 yuan that year. The plaintiff's lawyer said to the court that the records in the ledger were inconsistent with Zhou Zishan's current account and could not prove that Zhou Zishan had repaid the debt on behalf of the plaintiff's deceased father. Moreover, according to Zhou Zishan's current account, the plaintiff had paid Zhou Zishan several payments in 1927. The court checked the statements, and because the interrogation had lasted for an hour and there were still things to be investigated, it was ruled that the hearing would be rescheduled to November 9.

### Several Thousand Barber Shops in the City Plan to Form a Cooperative

There are thousands of barber shops in this city, employing 40,000 barbers. The industry consumes the most cosmetics because it serves modern women for haircuts and makeovers. Over the years, it has amounted to millions. Most of the cosmetics used, such as perfume, soap, and hair oil, are imported. Over time, the benefits are increasingly flowing abroad, which has a significant impact on the national economy. It is now learned that enthusiastic people in the industry have initiated the organization of a consumer cooperative to save on expenses and recover benefits. They also plan to raise shares to establish a factory to manufacture various cosmetics themselves. Representatives of the industry, Chen Yongting, Zhu Mingqing, and dozens of others, held a dinner at the Lao Ban Zhai Restaurant last night. Many supporters from all walks of life also attended. During the dinner, Zhu Mingqing reported on the significance of organizing the barber industry consumer cooperative. Chen Yongting, Chen Defu, Jin Zhibao, Jin Wanquan, Wang Chunbo, Liu Shunlin, Wang Yongcai, Lu Yukuan, Hua Defu, Du Defa, Xu Dengxiang, Zhu Yucheng, Chen Yongyuan, and others discussed the results and decided to formally establish a preparatory committee for the consumer cooperative. The issue of establishing a factory to manufacture cosmetics themselves was also decided to be actively pursued, and Sun Ren, a chemical engineer who studied in Germany, was hired to oversee everything.

### The Man Shot Was Actually a Bandit; The Wuweizhai Robbery Was Solved; The Police Department Is Investigating the Remaining Gang Members

The Shanghai Times reported that at about 1:00 p.m. yesterday (the 28th), a man suddenly arrived at the Sanmin Hospital at the intersection of North Henan Road and Tiantong Road, seeking treatment for a gunshot wound. The person was either Japanese or Korean and spoke poor Shanghai dialect, asking the doctor not to report to the police. However, the doctor refused and confined him to a room. When the detectives from Huizi Police Station

Arrived after receiving the report and investigated, they immediately determined that the person was a bandit who, on the night of the 27th of this month, along with an accomplice, broke into the Wuweizhai Restaurant at No. 76 Jing'an Temple Road with weapons, robbed it of 500 yuan, and escaped. During the escape, he was shot and wounded by a Chinese policeman but still managed to escape in a rickshaw. His accomplice also escaped without a trace. After Huizi Police Station detectives apprehended the suspect, they notified the Japanese Consulate Police Department and took the suspect away. It is heard that he has been sent to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road. Late yesterday night,

The police claimed that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department and the Japanese Consulate Police Department are still investigating the case. It was found that during the Wuweizhai robbery on the night of the 27th, the Chinese policeman fired three shots at the bandits, and the arrested suspect had three bullet wounds, which confirmed that the suspect was the bandit who was injured and escaped in the robbery. It is heard that the suspect was injured in the face, right arm, and chest, but the injuries were not serious. After the robbery, he managed to escape the police dragnet and barely spent the night. Yesterday morning,

He went to two Japanese doctors in Hongkou to seek treatment, but fled in panic because the doctors reported to the police. At 1:15 p.m., he turned to Sanmin Hospital and finally fell into the police dragnet. It is heard that the suspect claimed that he was shot in the Xujiahui area of western Shanghai on the night of the 27th.

### Theft of Introduction Letter, Impersonating for Job, Embezzlement of Public Funds Leads to Arrest

A certain Ye Dingyuan, who previously worked at the Hading (transliteration) Company at 121 Beijing Road for several years, resigned this year. Later, his nephew, Chen Jiqi (also known as Chen Dexian), knew that his uncle was highly trusted by the foreign manager of the company. He seized the opportunity to obtain a letter of recommendation for a job change from the foreign firm's manager. He then impersonated his uncle's name and went to the Maerkang Company at 220 Sichuan Road to seek employment. The company, seeing the letter of introduction from the Hading Company, hired him. For several months, everything went smoothly. However, on the 30th of last month, the manager of Maerkang Company gave Chen a check from the Chen Zongyuan Bank for 6,000 yuan, instructing him to cash it. Unexpectedly, after cashing the check, Chen embezzled the funds and fled without a trace. The company reported this to the General Patrol Room. After investigation by Chinese Detective Feng Qishan, it was discovered that Chen had used the name Ye Dingyuan. Therefore, they sought out Ye, but after investigation, Ye denied ever working for Maerkang Company. After further investigation, the truth was revealed. Chen was apprehended yesterday at 32 Hengchang Lane, Beile Road, at the residence of his fiancée, Sun Peifang. It was discovered that after embezzling the funds, Chen deposited them in the Siming and China Banks but had spent 650 yuan, claiming it was lost in gambling dens in West Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The Patrol Room's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested that the hearing be postponed because the investigation was not yet complete. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, he was ordered to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.

University of Hong Kong Graduates Who Pass the Entrance Examination Are Allowed to Enter Chinese Universities as Regular Students

(Hong Kong Dispatch) The University of Hong Kong, in order to promote Sino-British cultural exchange and benefit students from mainland China, established several scholarships for Chinese students starting last year. Currently, there are two students studying at the university who were selected and sent by the Ministry of Education of the Chinese National Government. To reciprocate the University of Hong Kong's generosity in treating Chinese students, the Ministry of Education previously stipulated that graduates of English colleges in Hong Kong could not apply to national universities or independent colleges in China as regular students, but could only apply with equivalent academic qualifications (the number of places for those applying with equivalent academic qualifications accounted for only 5% of the total number of regular students). Now, it is permitted that anyone who has completed the first class of English colleges in Hong Kong and passed the University of Hong Kong entrance examination will be specially allowed to apply to public and private universities and independent colleges in China as regular students to show preferential treatment. Furthermore, at the request of the Chinese government, the university has sent six graduates from the Department of Civil Engineering, three graduates from the Department of Electrical Engineering, and one graduate from the Department of Mechanical Engineering to serve in the rear areas of southwest China. In addition, there are three graduates from various departments who are serving in the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives in Guangxi. It is believed that Sino-British friendship will become closer due to cultural exchange and academic relations.

### Finance: Selling Pressure on Foreign Exchange Eases by Noon, Subsequent Market Situation Turns Tense Again

Regarding the foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC listed British exchange rate increased by 125, changing to a suspension of 3 points and 8125. The US exchange rate was listed at 5.875 yuan, with a decrease of 25 points. Other exchange rates, such as Dutch, Russian, and Japanese, unanimously increased. As for the domestic market situation, it suddenly tightened. There was no stimulus in the environment, and foreign banks such as British and American banks had very strong appetites. Although speculators sold heavily, they were able to cope with ease. At the beginning of the morning, the US exchange rate was the loosest, with transactions at 6 yuan and 25 first calls. By noon, it turned weak. Sasseon and others also pulled up, and the trend went from tight to flat. As a result, British gold closed at 3 points and 90625, and the US exchange rate closed at 6 yuan and 03125, which was tighter by 0625 and 125 compared to the previous day's British and American exchange rates, respectively.

British Gold Traded at Four Points

At the beginning of the morning, London's large orders, both near-term and far-term, fell by 0625. New York's silver price remained flat. London's raw gold was fixed. The exchange rate of British to US remained unchanged, while the British to Shanghai increased by 0625. The US to British increased by 75, the US to Shanghai increased by 18 points, and there was no market for the US to France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling price in the morning was 3 points and 96875 for British gold and 6 yuan and 15625 for the US exchange rate. Compared to the previous day's closing, there was no change in the British and American exchange rates. After opening, Huaxing first released this month's first calls, and foreign banks received 4 points. Speculators followed and sold, and the US exchange rate for October sold to foreign banks reached 6 yuan and 21875. HSBC announced the listed exchange rate, with the British exchange rate increasing by 125 and the US exchange rate firming by 25. Other exchange rates also unanimously increased. The silver balance tax was announced, decreasing by 0.25. Afterwards, Huaxing and speculators continued to release orders, but HSBC, American banks, and other foreign banks had good appetites, so the easing trend was blocked. HSBC entered the October US exchange rate of Huaxing at 6 yuan and 1875. Later, domestic speculators sold heavily, and the funds were abundant for a time, causing the October US exchange rate to drop to 6 yuan and 5. By noon, the selling pressure eased slightly, and Japanese banks, Huaxing, and British and American banks were all eager to buy. The price rebounded and tightened. Japanese banks entered the next month's US exchange rate of foreign banks at 6 yuan and 0625. The afternoon closing was 3 points and 90625 for British gold and 6 yuan and 03125 for the US exchange rate, which was softer by 0625 and tighter by 125 compared to the morning opening.

Sasseon Had Purchases in the Afternoon Market

Sasseon also came to purchase in the afternoon market. The market initially weakened, with the November US exchange rate priced at 6 yuan. Later, it rebounded slightly. Speculators sold the same month's US exchange rate to foreign banks for 6 yuan and 03125. There was little change before the evening closing. As a result, British gold closed at 3 points and 90625 and the US exchange rate closed at 6 yuan and 03125. The current month's rate was the same as the spot price, tighter by 0625 and down by 125 compared to the previous day's British gold and US exchange rate, respectively.

Hong Kong's US Exchange Rate Slightly Decreased

Hong Kong, 29th (Monday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. There were no gains or losses in the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates.

### Various Parties Resume Searching, Cooked Gold Rebounds

Yesterday's cooked gold dark market rebounded and increased. The highest price once reached the 5,600 yuan mark. The foreign exchange rate went from easing to tightening, and people's confidence turned strong. Securities firms and a certain bank were vigorously searching for purchases in the morning, gradually raising prices from low levels. Securities firms and gold shops in the afternoon market also tended to buy. Although bullish banks closed at high levels, the result still closed at 5,520 yuan, an increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume for the whole day was still strong, at more than 2,000 taels. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops increased by 10 yuan, while Guan Yu and others remained flat.

Cooked Gold Increases by One Hundred Yuan

At the beginning of the morning, people's confidence was still strong, and the price was stable. Gold shops entered 10 taels of silver from banks at 5,420 yuan, opening higher by 20 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. Later, money changers sold 20 taels to gold shops for 5,410 yuan. Before long, money changers and securities firms vigorously purchased more than 100 taels, and the price immediately rose. Securities firms entered 10 taels from gold shops for 5,470 yuan. Afterwards, due to the easing and firming of the foreign exchange rate, both banks and gold shops sold, falling to 5,415 yuan. However, a certain bank continued to search for purchases at low levels, so the price rebounded. Gold shops entered 20 taels of silver from banks, once seeing a top price of 5,570 yuan. Also, banks sold 10 taels to gold shops, rebounding to 5,525 yuan. As a result, banks traded 20 taels for 5,510 yuan, making the noon closing price. In the afternoon market, banks and money changers vigorously entered. The banks opened the market by entering 10 taels of gold from gold shops, reporting 5,540 yuan. Shortly after, the banks released 20 taels from securities firms for 5,515 yuan. At this time, gold shops and securities firms had a strong intention to enter, pulling up dozens of yuan. Banks traded 10 taels for 5,550 yuan. However, because bullish banks were eager to close at high levels, the price was lowered again. Gold shops released 10 taels to banks for 5,490 yuan, while banks traded 20 taels again, reporting 5,520 yuan, making the evening closing price, an increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 160 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current brand gold in cash gold shops was more than 10 yuan higher than cooked gold, and the closing price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was 560 yuan lower than the listed gold, and both rarely opened for trading.

The Price of Gold Ornaments in Silver Shops Also Increased

The selling price of gold ornaments in silver shops increased by 10 yuan at 10:00 AM, and there was no change after that. Datonghang was priced at 570 yuan. The prices of Xintonghang were similar to the above price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Yen Speculation

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: the market price of cooked gold rose sharply and quickly, and the prices of British and American gold pounds also rebounded by 3 yuan uniformly. The price of British gold notes remained unchanged. The price of American gold notes initially continued to fall from the downward trend of the previous day, once falling to 15 yuan, 3 jiao, and 8 fen. Afterwards, because HSBC and British and American banks had a good appetite for the black market US exchange rate, people's confidence turned stable. The needs of various parties turned strong, and the market price rose step by step, once rising to 15 yuan, 9 jiao, and 2 fen, but finally fell slightly to 15 yuan, 8 jiao, which was a rebound of 3 jiao compared to the previous day. The price of Hong Kong notes continued to fall due to the abundant supply, and the evening market fell to 3 yuan, 8 jiao, and 6 fen, a further decrease of 6 fen compared to the previous day. The prices of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both rose sharply again and again because there were not many in circulation, and speculators were making trouble from it. The former was as high as 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen, and the latter rose to 1 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 fen.

Qianzhuang Reserve Also Reduces Interest Rate

The Qianzhuang United Reserve of this city sent a letter to all member qianzhuang yesterday, stating that it would reduce the interest rate on check deposits by 1 li from November 1st, that is, from November 1st, the check deposits deposited by each qianzhuang in the Reserve will be calculated at an annual interest rate of 2%.

### Discount Rates Decrease Again

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange-cleared bills was still decreasing. The discount rate for each 1,000 yuan was still 8 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen for the initial discount, and 9 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen for the outgoing discount. In the afternoon, it decreased to 9 yuan, and the discount approval was only 8 yuan, which was 2 jiao and 5 fen smaller than the previous day. The interest rate for the Qianye Association remained unchanged, and the morning and afternoon markets were both priced at 1 jiao and 2 fen.

### Grains: Over 80,000 Bags Arriving Today; Foreign Rice from Saigon Reaches Shanghai; Buyers Hesitant, Market Price Gradually Declines

Today, a large quantity of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, transported directly from Saigon by the French company D'Orient's mail ship, totaling 8,000 tons, equivalent to over 80,000 bags. It is expected to arrive at the port today and berth at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. (Zu)

Orders for foreign rice flooded in. Although powerful major players intended to support the market, ultimately supply exceeded demand, confidence weakened, and speculative traders competed to sell, causing the market to gradually decline. Yinghua Company, dealing in reimported rice, initially quoted 73 yuan when the exchange rate retracted, but with limited buying and heavy selling, the actual transaction price in the afternoon was only 71 yuan. Original bagged rice initially opened at 73.7 yuan, but later buyers only offered 72 yuan. The market appeared tired and listless, suggesting a possible further decline. Moreover, most of the recent orders, totaling over 100,000 bags, will arrive in port soon. Therefore, the market and investor sentiment currently lack any expectation of a turnaround. Spot transactions were less than 5,000 bags, and original bagged rice was only a few dozen tons. As a result of spot trading, all prices fell by about one yuan. Grade One new Saigon rice opened at 66 to 65.5 yuan; Grade Two, 61 to 60.5 yuan; and premium grade machine-milled rice opened at 64.7 to 64 yuan. However, rice from the central region (Zhongguan) was abundant in the market, leading to intense competition and the steepest price drops, from 61-62 yuan to 59 yuan. Grade Two Siam rice was 60 to 58.5 yuan, small-milled rice 59 yuan, and broken rice 55 to 54 yuan. Broken tip rice ranged from 52 yuan down to 49.5 yuan, while Wuhu broken tip rice was 58.4 yuan to 58 yuan, appearing slightly more resilient than foreign broken tip rice.

New early rice and kiln-grown wild rice totaled 13,000 piculs. Shops on this street, seeing the decline in foreign rice, also reduced their appetite. As a result, sellers were more willing to sell, and new early rice and kiln-grown rice fell by one yuan. New early rice was quoted at 71.5 to 71 yuan, and Qingjiao kiln-grown rice at 70 to 73.2 yuan. Yishi Xing wild rice, due to its scarcity, remained relatively firm, holding steady without change; wild rice remained at 79 yuan, down to 77.8 yuan, with Yishi Xing at 75 yuan. Du foreign tip rice lacked both success and failure; Du tip rice by the picul opened at 66.5 yuan, falling to 63.8 yuan. Sheep tip rice by the picul opened at 66 yuan, usually opening at 85 yuan.

Glutinous rice vendors have become sluggish, and the congee rice stall sales have also slowed. As a result, the market color has also softened. Yi-brand goods opened at 76 yuan, Changdan goods at 74.8 to 74 yuan, and Hong Kong white yuan at 71-72 yuan, down to 68-69 yuan, it is said.

### Flour Mill Supply Gradually Increases; Market Eases

The current flour market is dull and unremarkable. Since the recent easing of rice prices, actual sales of flour on this street have not been as active as before. Moreover, the supply from various mills has been increasing frequently, presenting a situation of oversupply. Reimported Lao Che Pai brand flour has been selling off, but buyers are waiting and watching. It is heard that it has already fallen to 18.8 yuan, and shops on this street have made some purchases. The situation for foreign flour is frequently softening because pre-orders will arrive at the beginning of the month, and the end of the month is approaching, so sellers are eager to sell. It is heard that Gao Pai Rising Sun brand foreign flour is only selling for 19.5 yuan, and Double Eagle brand has already fallen below the 19-yuan mark, with few transactions. Hua flour mills are still pricing at 17 yuan, with nearly 10,000 bags released by the two mills.

The wheat market is increasingly stagnant. This is because the supply has been scarce for a long time, and occasional sporadic arrivals are extremely rare. Furthermore, most of the supply is directly delivered to Japanese mills, and prices are also unchanged. As for market supply, it remains lacking. The Hua mills and the inland export market are also quiet, and the market remains as dull as ever.

### Securities, Domestic Bonds, and Foreign Stocks All See Declines

The after-hours market for securities saw its scope of fluctuation gradually widen yesterday. Spot goods in the financial sector continued to flow out, and long positions gradually emerged, causing market prices to become unsustainable. Both Class C and Class E bonds broke through the 9-yuan barrier and reached a recent low of 8.5 yuan. The morning opened steady, with Shunchang Xinfu making some purchases, raising prices by two or three jiao, but then Jiufeng Hongda sold heavily, ultimately falling back two or three jiao. Morning closing prices were mixed, with minimal fluctuations. In the afternoon, Yuxing sold off another large batch, and Tongkang bulls gradually emerged. Lianyi Hongda also released some positions. Jiufeng Yichang and Le Mao also made some sales. Although Dingkang Lianli and Shengchang bought a lot, they ultimately failed to maintain the price, and Class C and Class E bonds quickly broke through the 9-yuan mark and reached 8.5 yuan. Later, retail investors bought, and the price recovered slightly by one or two jiao. The market sentiment has declined and is difficult to stabilize temporarily. As a result of market prices, except for Class D bonds, which did not trade all day, all others uniformly fell by 5.5 to 9 jiao. The transaction volume was around one million yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Category  Highest  Lowest  Closing Price Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 67.75  67.20 67.20 Down 0.80

Unified B 61.90  61.30 61.30 Down 0.51

Unified C 59.75  58.50 58.75 Down 0.70

Unified D ——  ——  ——  ——

Unified E 59.45  48.35 85.45 Down 0.90

Stock trading: 50 shares of Cheng Wenren Yuan Real Estate Company were traded at a price of 25 yuan.

The opening of the public stock market seemed to have a general upward trend. Jardine Matheson first showed an increase, believing that its dividend would be announced immediately. The morning closing price even rose to a high of 91 yuan. In the afternoon, the company officially announced a dividend of 5 yuan, but the public seemed disappointed with this amount, and the price then gradually fell to a closing price of 85.5 yuan. The remaining stocks that had risen in the morning also fell back at this point. Only Jardine Brewery shares were able to maintain their strong position despite heavy pressure. Rubber shares remained overlooked, as the trading volume of industrial shares was extremely large.

London, 28th (Monday) telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British commercial companies' stocks remained flat, with no changes in the market.

### Yarn and Cotton: Short Selling of Cotton Yarn Becomes More Active

The yarn market, which had been rising for consecutive days, plummeted by 100 yuan in these four days. This kind of reactionary decline was also reasonable. However, such large ups and downs make people fearful. In reality, prices have entered a high level, making them prone to changes. Coupled with the fact that current sales have slowed slightly, and the long-term wind of foreign exchange has become stronger, those who purchased at high prices are uneasy, and liquidations have become active, causing the market to quickly decline. According to the market, General cotton has arrived in Shanghai in thousands of bags, and therefore, short sellers are very active in the forward market, making the market even weaker.

In the morning opening of the yarn market, due to the rumors from the previous day that people were anxious and rumors were all negative, there were more sellers in the market. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1215 yuan. The selling frenzy was so strong that it fell directly to 1202 yuan. Upon seeing the low price, those who had sold short the previous day quickly covered their positions, and it rebounded to 1214 yuan. At this time, the opening of foreign exchange saw further lengthening, and the selling frenzy resumed, returning to 1203 yuan. After a slight correction, it was heard that the market at the exchange was trending upward, and the exchange rate changed and contracted, causing the market to gradually turn around, rising to 1227 yuan. The closing price slightly returned to a flat level, at 1223 yuan. It was found that the total transaction volume for half a day was 7770 bags, and the market for 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 17 yuan. Xinsheng Factory opened 200 bags of 40-count Golden Tiger yarn at a price of 1470 yuan, 300 bags of 20-count Golden Tiger yarn at a price of 1150 yuan, and 200 bags of 18-count Golden Tiger yarn at a price of 1030 yuan. It was found that 75 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today, and another 40 pieces were shipped to Siam. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:

Hong Kong 540  Same Trade 6,500

Inland 730  Total 7,770

### Cotton Market Quiet

The current cotton trading has become quiet. This is because the sharp decline in the yarn market has slightly stimulated raw cotton, so the market is showing weakness, and transactions are particularly scarce.

Changyinsha 240.00 Defeng 200 bags

Huoji flower 324.00 Defeng bought 236 bags

Dazhongji 243.00  Shenghuai 20 pieces

Another report: Foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, the market is quiet, because of the lack of important buyers, and later because of the sale of overseas cotton merchants, the result was a closing price lower than the previous day by 4-5 pounds. Yesterday, India's cotton market, including forecasts, did not fluctuate much.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading, recently because the exchange rate is long and loose, all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude, but the market's inventory is not abundant, so market prices have never been able to turn cheap. The mentality among the same trade remains exceptionally firm.

### Piece Goods: Prices Rebound

The factory cloth market was slack yesterday. Because the yarn price fell sharply and then slightly rebounded, people were uneasy. National cloth sales were relatively stable. Speculative hoarding tended toward selling, and the end of the month had arrived, so retail investors also sold off. However, buyers were watching and only made scattered spot purchases with slight transactions. The selling price of a portion of fine cloth and colored cloth continued to fall by 2.5 jiao per piece, and coarse cloth fell by 1 to 2.5 jiao. Factory disks and large hoarded goods are still insisting on not releasing. On this street, more than 300 pieces of grey cloth, bleached dyed, and printed cloth were traded. The Wenzhou gang bought more than 200 pieces of coarse and fine cloth and serge. The Fujian gang bought nearly 100 pieces of fine cloth and colored twill. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs bought more than 200 pieces of colored cloth. The North Road Yanjin gang bought more than 100 pieces of blue cloth, coarse cloth, and flannel.

Eastern cloth yesterday, because actual sales on this street were good, and the same trade was bullish, white fine cloth and fine twill rebounded by 5-6 jiao per piece. The majority of transactions in the market were mid-range fine cloths, with 600-700 pieces traded. Longtou serge turned silent, which is sufficient to show that the actual demand for dyed blanks is not small. At closing, Longtou fine cloth sold for 37.2 jiao, and Sijunzi serge for 1.1475 yuan.

Today, 25 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Rangoon, 380 pieces to Hong Kong, 7 pieces to Little Luzon, 115 pieces to Siam, and 75 pieces to Singapore.

### Oilseed Cakes: Oil Market Lifeless

Yesterday, the oil market was still lacking bullish sentiment. Although certificates for moving out stock are still being issued, the outlets are narrow, making it difficult to arouse interest. Moreover, both arrivals and inventory are thick, and the number of futures contracts is gradually increasing, so its market sentiment is in a slump. Four traders appear calm on the surface, but are quite frustrated at heart. The total market opened with 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at a price of 75 yuan, 200 pieces of Dayou Factory soybean oil at a price of 85 yuan and 84.25 yuan, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at a price of 69.5 yuan to 68.5 yuan, and 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil at a price of 69 yuan. Qingdao raw oil for November delivery opened at 250 barrels at a price of 98 yuan to 96.5 jiao, 350 barrels for late November delivery at a price of 99 yuan to 97.25 jiao, and called for 800 barrels for late December delivery at a price of 100 yuan to 99 yuan.

Also, 610 units of soybeans arrived from Tianjin yesterday, and 184 pieces of tung oil arrived. Miscellaneous grains exported included 200 bags of soybeans, shipped to Hong Kong on the 30th, 600 bags to Singapore, and 250 bags to Little Luzon. There were also 150 pieces of sesame oil and 1,000 cans of butter shipped to Hong Kong.

### City Sugar: Foreign Sugar Trading Stagnant

Yesterday, the sugar market, apart from Lai Chang and the Association, seemed to be at a standstill. Only Taikoo Cube White B Mark East Pier was priced at 70 yuan, West Pier at 70 yuan and 5 jiao, totaling a small 1 yuan and 1 jiao. Dutch Red Spot was at 54 yuan, and goods en route for November 18th, with orders placed, were at 54 yuan and 4 jiao, a small 6 jiao. Market Price: Tuesday, October 29th, Year 29. Financial.

### Regarding "Reconstructing Morality"

— Lu Yang

After I published an appeal to medical workers in this newspaper on the first of this month, I received a letter from reader Mr. Wang through the editor, who, in addition to sympathizing with the appeal, said that in the process of social morality's decay, we should advocate "reconstructing morality." The meaning of "reconstructing morality" is that each of us makes a new resolution, advocates a new life, a life based on the principles of honesty, purity, selflessness, and universal love, a life managed by God, to save today's moral decline." Mr. Wang's enthusiasm for advocating morality, and his ability to address the superficiality and selfishness of most people by advocating the above virtues, is indeed something I admire. However, when I wrote the previous article, I did not really expect it to make much of a contribution to reality. I only hoped to promote social awareness of this issue. This is not self-deprecation. In fact, I understand very well that the negligence or even discrimination of medical workers towards ordinary patients has its complex reasons, and it is not just a matter of "morality"!

Undeniably, so-called morality is just one of the society's ideologies, and the ideology of a certain society is determined by the economic organization of that society; in other words, the economy is the lower foundation of a society, and politics, law, religion, morality, art, etc. are its superstructure. Therefore, if we only try to improve the morality of this society by reconstructing morality, that is possible, but if we say that we want to fundamentally improve the moral system of this society, then it will disappoint us! Just imagine, with rice prices so high recently, can we make a rice weevil reflect on moral issues and give all the rice it has hoarded to starving people? That is simply unimaginable! He is free from the law, but a person who steals a handful of white rice from a hoarder's rice cart is qualified to be dragged to prison with a crime on his back. This is the morality of this society. What is there to say? The other day, Mr. Shi explicitly pointed out in this newspaper in an article starting from the overcrowding of prisons that too many of those lawbreaking prisoners are driven by the needs of life, because the society cannot solve their living problems, which leads to their taking risks. How can that be just a matter of "morality"!

Therefore, I think that if we want to advocate true morality, then instead of taking reconstructing morality as a means of improvement, we should prioritize finding out the basic reasons that cause the current moral decline and working hard to rationalize it.

### Difficult, Signing, and the Doctor's Responsibility

Dear Editor:

On October 4th, I read Ms. Lu Yang's article "Perform Our Task with the Highest Degree of Vigilance" in your publication. It moved me to tears. I recalled the tragic death of my late wife during childbirth. "Was it the doctor's negligence? Or was it caused by the disease?" The flashing of the circumstances makes me feel infinitely sad. Here is a detailed description of the process. I earnestly hope that you will disclose it so that doctors and husbands will pay more attention to the ladies.

My late wife was very healthy before giving birth and had been examined before and during admission to the hospital. When she was about to give birth, the doctor did not give any reports. After a few hours, I personally went to the hospital to visit. I was told that she had not yet given birth. I requested to see the pregnant woman, and she was in the waiting room. I was originally allowed to enter, but I had no choice but to go home disappointed and wait for good news. Less than two hours after I arrived home, a messenger came from the hospital and summoned me to the hospital quickly. I thought that she had already given birth. When I arrived at the hospital, who knew that my poor wife was wrapped in gauze in the morgue and had said goodbye to me forever. At that time, I was so grief-stricken that I almost passed out. I hurriedly asked how she died. They replied that it was due to difficult labor and heart disease. I asked why the examination before birth did not report heart disease. Furthermore, why did they not seek the consent and signature of family members before performing the surgery? The answers given were evasive. Because I believed in the large scale of the hospital and the high level of skill of the doctors, and because of financial reasons, I had to admit my bad luck and just grieve.

After reading Ms. Lu Yang's article, I suddenly realized that the indifferent attitude of some doctors and midwives in the hospital, and their failure to take full responsibility, etc., must have caused my wife's death due to negligence and dereliction of duty. Although I don't know the cause of Mrs. Li's death, I suppose it must be one of them.

I have a few questions below, and I pray that people in the community will review them.

(1) Is it very dangerous for a pregnant woman with heart disease during childbirth? If the pregnant woman had been examined by a doctor when she arrived at the hospital and found to have no heart disease, could she suddenly develop heart disease a few hours before giving birth?

(2) Is this type of heart disease harmful to life?

(3) When a doctor knows that a pregnant woman has heart disease, does he usually save the adult or protect the baby?

(4) Does the hospital have regulations that family members must sign before performing surgery for difficult labor? However, if the doctor has already examined the patient and filled out a form one month before delivery and at the time of delivery, proving that there will be no difficult labor, and there are no other changes at the time of delivery, can it suddenly become difficult labor?

(5) In the above situation, does the doctor need to seek the consent and signature of the family before performing surgery?

(6) If the family has not signed, and the hospital performs the surgery, resulting in an accident, is the hospital and the doctor fully responsible? Chen Lian bows respectfully

Huo Sang Detective Case

### The Dancer's Women's Dormitory

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

The Shoes Problem

Huo Sang was also walking east, and had stopped at the corner of Datong Road. Lao Mao was also standing next to him. I rushed over to take a look. Lying on the ground was a person, it was that old man Li Zhiban!

At this time, none of us spoke. I looked at Li Zhiban on the ground. His body was curled up and lying on his side on the ground. He was still wearing that dark blue wrinkled silk camel hair robe, and a pair of black satin shoes with double beam cloth soles on his feet. His eyes were closed tightly, and his lips were open, panting there. I knew that he had been shot, but I didn't know where. Huo Sang had already squatted down and used his hand to unbutton the old man's chest. Only then did I see that there was a bright red blood stain on the right chest of the shirt inside.

Huo Sang tilted his head and said to me, "Bao Lang, quickly make a phone call to the police department and tell them to send an ambulance."

I immediately turned around and ran into the doorway. Jin Mei was stunned inside the iron gate. I pushed away and rushed into the house, stepping up the stairs three steps at a time. At the turn of the stairs, I dialed the number of the telephone. The call went very smoothly, and it took only a minute or two. Ni Jinshou was still in the hall. This news was of course unexpected to him. He promised to come right away.

When I returned to the corner outside, Huo Sang had straightened up and was putting a few pieces of paper, which seemed to have been searched from Li Zhiban's body, into his own pocket. His expression was of course very nervous, but not flustered. Lao Mao was still standing next to him, and the flustered expression was taken care of by him alone. I told Huo Sang that Ni Jinshou was coming right away. Huo Sang just nodded. He also looked at the opposite side of the street and both ends, and spoke to Lao Mao.

"You came out before me, did you see anything?"

Lao Mao opened his small eyes and nodded, saying, "I saw him - I saw Zhao Boxiong, surnamed Zhao."

Huo Sang didn't answer, nor did he look particularly surprised, but he closed his mouth tightly, as if thinking about something.

I couldn't help but say, "Oh my, it's this guy again! So powerful!" Huo Sang didn't answer, and said to Lao Mao, "Could you have seen it wrong?" Lao Mao shook his head and said, "No, when I ran to the corner of the road, I saw two people running north and one person running south." He pointed his hand to the north and south ends of Datong Road. "The two people going north have run far away, so I certainly can't see clearly. The one who escaped to the south was still very close. I saw him very clearly. It was really that tall guy surnamed Zhao. I am used to seeing his back, so I can't be wrong." (151)

### "Watching and Caring" Responsibility

— Yun Si

On the evening of June 24th, I suddenly felt feverish. The next day, I couldn't even eat; however, for the sake of my work, I had to pull myself together and continue working. I endured day by day like this, and by July 5th, the fever was even higher, and I really couldn't bear it anymore.

At that time, a friend of mine strongly suggested that I go to a certain hospital on Xinzha Road for treatment. So, at 10:20 a.m. that day, I was admitted to the hospital. After completing the admission procedures, a hospital worker helped me into the ward. The ward was arranged with three rooms connected, and the middle room was attached to the nursing station, where there were always two or three nurses waiting to care for the patients. However, it just so happened that when I arrived at the ward, there was only one nurse, who was slumped over the table, dozing off. The worker shouted loudly for a long time, "Miss, a new patient is here, please arrange a bed!" Only then did the nurse raise her head and slowly stand up; she even stretched lazily, as if she hadn't slept enough. But, she had to come over and perform her duties. After about half an hour, the bed was finally made, but I was already dizzy, so I had to lie down and sleep. Because of the high fever, I took the opportunity to ask, "Miss, please take my temperature quickly!" Upon hearing this, the nurse immediately frowned and said, "You're such a nuisance!" and then she left.

I endured the pain until a little after five o'clock, when three doctors came into the ward. At that time, the nurse was again slumped over the table, dozing off. Just as the doctors approached the nursing station, the nurse was awakened by the sound of leather shoes. Her face turned red, and she hurriedly took out the "Chart." One of the doctors took the "Chart" and walked to my bedside, first examined me, wrote out a prescription, and then said to the nurse, "After a while, please give him an enema!" Who knew that upon hearing this, the nurse said, "How annoying! Another enema to give." Then she forcefully pushed the "Chart" into the cabinet, making a loud bang, like a hand grenade exploding. The sound awakened those trauma patients who were sound asleep.

In short, that nurse just scolded and reprimanded every day according to her mood. Almost all the patients complained and silently endured their suffering.

Breaking down the word "nurse" [看護] (kanhu) into its components: "看" (kan) means to watch over patients, and "護" (hu) means to protect patients. In such a large-scale hospital, I don't think there should be nurses who don't uphold these principles. It should be understood that in addition to "watching and caring" for patients, nurses should also have a "comforting" heart. How can they cause patients even more distress? I hope all nurses will correct their faults if they have them, and strive to improve if they don't! (Compliments)

### The First Page in Musical History — Memories of the Occupation of Oslo

— Yong

Oslo, the capital of Norway, with a population of 250,000, was occupied by German troops on April 9th of this year. Although this event has already become yesterday's news, the details of what happened are quite memorable. I have specially translated the report from the Chicago Daily News below for the readers of this publication.

Prior to this, when the German army attacked the city, the vanguard force consisted of only 1,500 men. After arriving, because the number of troops was small and military weapons were not used, they adopted a method of hypnotizing people with music. They first divided into several small teams, each carrying musical instruments, and played German waltzes and American joyful tunes along the main roads. One of the teams was playing on the steps of the State Council. The people of Oslo were pitiable; they swarmed up in groups, all excitedly competing to enjoy the music, forgetting that the enemies were standing in front of them. As a result, 1,500 German soldiers occupied a big city with a population of 250,000 all day without encountering any resistance!

Two days later, an almost identical "comedy" was staged in the same place. This time, the main force of the German army arrived, totaling 20,000 men. Within half an hour of landing, only the sound of a large chorus could be heard on the docks. The infantry was in the front, the artillery in the middle, and the transport team followed behind. As they landed, they were all singing a famous German song called "Going to Town." When the people of Oslo saw this phenomenon, they still believed that nothing serious had happened.

Finally, when planes painted with the swastika flew in groups in the sky but did not drop bombs, the people of Oslo realized that their capital had fallen. It was too late to resist! The German subjugation of Norway was achieved through the complementary forces of military and music. In musical history, we should also record this event on a page!

### A Look at the Yongchun Society, Past and Present

— Wei Wo

The Yongchun Society, led by Li Wanchun, has not been to Shanghai for nearly three years. In response to renewed invitations, they are making a comeback, but the lineup is slightly different than before. Therefore, I have listed the lineups of the Yongchun Society's previous visits to the South as follows:

Year 24 (at Gong Wu Tai) Year 25 (at Huangjin)

Lead role Li Wanchun

Martial male lead Mao Qinglai

Clown Xiao Kuiguan Zhang Yongliang

Painted face Gao Binfeng

Acrobatic clown Liu Binsheng

Acrobatic actors Yu Binan Wang Delu Li Dechun Zhang Fuhua

Year 27 (at Huangjin)

Lead role Li Yuchun

Martial male lead Mao Qinglai Zhao Shengbi

Young male lead Gao Weilian

Painted face Su Lianhan Chen Furui

Old male lead Chen Xiguang

Martial female lead Zhu Shengfu

Acrobatic clown Liu Binsheng

Acrobatic actors Gao Shenghong Bao Shengqi Yu Binan Wang Delu Li Dechun Zhang Fuhua

Clown Zhang Yonglu (i.e. Zhang Yongliang)

Year 29 (at Gengxin)

Lead role Li Wanchun

Female lead Li Junong Gu Yulan

Martial male lead Lan Yuechun Jiang Tielin

Young male lead Yan Qinglin

Painted face Qiu Shengrong Wang Yongchang Chen Furui

Clown Zhang Yonglu

Old male lead Yang Zonglin

Acrobatic clown Liu Binsheng

Acrobatic actors Wang Delu Bao Shengqi Yu Yiting

Based on the Yongchun Society's previous lineups in Shanghai, this performance's lineup is the most complete. Gu Yulan, one of the female leads, originally named Yulanhua, trained at the Binqing Society. She and Wanchun are like siblings, and she has been to Shanghai several times, so no introduction is necessary. Li Junong is making her first trip south, so it is necessary to introduce her. Junong transitioned from an amateur to a professional performer and is a disciple of the late old opera singer Yu Yuqin. She performs female lead and martial female lead roles and has Yuqin's true legacy, which is quite unique. This time, she joined the Yongchun Society to collaborate with Wanchun, and it is expected that there will be many wonderful performances. Lan Yuechun, the martial male lead, was Wanchun's old partner. Yuechun and Wanchun are also like siblings; they both trained at the Binqing Society. When they starred in the old capital, all the plays they performed achieved the effect of beautiful flowers and green leaves. They separated due to some reason, and it has been more than ten years since then. This time, because Mao Qinglai left, Wanchun re-invited Yuechun to collaborate. They are familiar with the routine, and Yuechun should be able to handle it with ease. Jiang Tielin is Wanchun's disciple. His martial skills are well-grounded, and he can fight and flip, completely in the "ruthless" style. Yan Qinglin, the young male lead, is the son of the old opera singer Jiuzhenfeng and the top disciple of Jiang Miaoxiang. He follows Jiang Liu's style, and his singing and recitation are excellent. Qiu Shengrong, the painted face, is well-known to the people of Shanghai. Wang Yongchang is also a transition from amateur to professional performer, with a burly figure. His art follows Hao Shouxin's style, and he is quite similar to Hao. After becoming a professional, he immediately joined the Yongchun Society and has been with them for many years. Wanchun regards him as his right and left hand. In all the plays written by Wanchun, Yongchang occupies an important position. Chen Furui is the only talented painted face from the third class of Fu Liancheng. His art follows his senior brother Hou Xirui. He has been with Li Wanchun the longest, but unfortunately, he is short and fat, lacking aesthetic appeal. Zhang Yonglu, the clown, originally named Qisui Chou, is also a disciple of the Binqing Society. He was initially a supporting role in the Yongchun Society. After Xiao Kuiguan left, Yonglu became the leading clown. His skills are not weak, and he can make a loud sound. He is a promising talent among clowns. As for Liu Binsheng, Bao Shengqi, Wang Delu, and Yu Yiting, they are all Wanchun's subordinates, so I won't go into detail.

### Nan Tiesheng's Coming to Shanghai is Scheduled

— Ke Yun Louzhu

Nan Tiesheng, known as the "Mei Lanfang" of Hankou, performed at the Huangjin last autumn, and the reviews were quite good, leaving a deep impression on the people of Shanghai. Due to the great flood in the north, the supporting actors could not be gathered, making it difficult to fully display his talents. After performing for the remaining performances, he quickly returned north. Now, he has been invited by Huangjin to continue the performance after Yu Hua. This time, he is bringing with him the male lead Yang Baosen and a young male lead, who will be replaced by Yu Zhenfei.

Yang Baosen's singing style is vigorous. He has a deep understanding of Shu Yan's Qin腔 [Qinqiang], which is quite similar, and has already received good reviews. Yu Zhenfei is proficient in both Kunqu and miscellaneous plays, with a very deep foundation. His performances are neither fiery nor lukewarm, but gentle and refined. Whenever the plot becomes tense, he reveals his passion, using both voice and expression, which is particularly unique. In the current young male lead scene, he can be called unparalleled. Since separating from Yu Shuang, he has been collaborating with Tiesheng, performing in various cities in North China, rising to fame. The two have a very close personal relationship, so Zhenfei's collaboration with Tiesheng is also limited to coming to the South. With Zhenfei as his assistant, Tiesheng has beautiful flowers and green leaves, which can be said to complement each other. Mei Wanhua's performance is uncertain, and Huang Guiqiu has a voice but lacks appearance, only Tiesheng's color and artistry are unmatched and flawless. This time, he will come south to give a public performance, and his theatrical talent will definitely be brought into full play.
