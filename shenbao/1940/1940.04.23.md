Editorial

### The Evolution of the Nordic War

Since the development of German military forces into Northern Europe, Denmark has been controlled bloodlessly and the main ports of Norway have been occupied. If, as Napoleon said, "War is the control of seeking position," this statement still has its important significance in modern warfare. In the initial phase of the Nordic War, Germany has taken the lead. Germany took Oslo, Bergen, Bodo, and Narvik in one fell swoop, waiting at sea for the Anglo-French to attack, and pursuing the Norwegian army on land, directly approaching Dombås. The German military strategy at this stage is to make the Norwegian army have nowhere to stand before the Anglo-French forces can make contact with the Norwegian army, and then devote all their efforts to dealing with the Anglo-French forces coming from the sea. What the Anglo-French are anxious about is to quickly land from the sea to aid the Norwegian army before it is defeated, so that Germany is attacked from both sides, not only unable to control the entire territory of Norway, but also has no foothold. So far, Anglo-French troops have landed at Sols and Djurs in northern Trondheim; according to Anglo-French sources, they have made contact with Norwegian troops and recovered Hamar. This is the initial success of the Anglo-French landing, which is certainly not enough to measure the victory or defeat of the overall situation; and the battle between the two sides will inevitably become more intense; therefore, future war reports from Norway deserve to be watched. However, the possible evolution of the Nordic situation is not limited to military affairs.

Germany under the leadership of Hitler has two unique methods for winning battles: one is the "blitzkrieg tactic," using rapid military action to destroy small and weak countries; the other is the "divide and conquer tactic," using political means to achieve the goal of winning without fighting. The blitzkrieg tactic is based on precise science, and the divide and conquer tactic is the legitimate inheritance of imperialism; since imperialism has always hunted for colonies, it often uses indigenous armies as its vanguard, causing them to kill each other, and then conquering them. The German military action in Norway cannot control a legal government as its tool like in Denmark, so it found a Quisling as a puppet to be used. Quisling's relationship with the German Nazi Party has been a matter of years ago. However, the Scandinavian countries not only have their deeply rooted nationalism, but also have long been baptized by democracy, which is fundamentally incompatible with German Nazism. The National Central Party organized by Quisling did have a period of expansion in 1933 when Hitler came to power, but later it declined for a long time because of its own divisions and the public's distrust. After Hitler invaded Norway, he wanted to put Quisling on the stage; and Quisling actually put on his official robes, and issued a so-called political program, which also put aside party politics, saying that it would organize a new parliament based on economic groups and cultural groups, and implement true democracy. This is transplanting the "vocational group politics" theory of the Nazi Party to Norway, so that its master behind the scenes can rule Norway. Unexpectedly, it could not attract an audience. The Norwegian military and civilians still unanimously support the legitimate government to fight Germany, and Foreign Minister Hesselberg in the puppet government also abandoned his post and fled. Recently, there has been news that the Quisling cabinet has resigned and the mayor of Oslo has organized an administrative committee to govern the new German-occupied area. This has proved that the blitzkrieg tactics used by Germany in Norway have encountered strong resistance halfway, and from then on, it has to engage in a broad and prolonged positional war; the divide and conquer tactics used are also not applicable to Norway, which has a strong national consciousness. Germany's attempt to control the entire territory of Norway has no hope of a quick victory, and no place for trickery. It can only use real knives and guns to fight against the Anglo-French-Norwegian alliance.

The entire occupation of Norway can not only provide Germany with military raw materials, but also put Sweden in a desperate situation militarily, and make it automatically throw itself into the arms of Germany. It is like throwing a stone at England, France, and Norway, and getting two birds with one stone, and having Sweden and Norway. Although Sweden has declared absolute neutrality, and Germany has also declared that it recognizes its neutrality, the scope of the war will not temporarily affect Sweden, but the spread of war is often not predetermined by reason. What's more, Germany regards blitzkrieg tactics and divide and conquer tactics as its successful masterpieces. Germany has something that it cannot help but do to Sweden, and Sweden has something that it cannot feel at ease with Germany. Judging from the internal situation in Sweden, although the authorities are working hard to strengthen its unified regime, there is more than one party in the country that is close to Nazism, such as the Swedish National Socialist Party, led by Frugaard, with the slogan of "Swedish Revival," and its party emblem is also the swastika; in 1933, it merged with the National Socialist Labor Party, and was led by Lindholm, who was recently arrested by the Swedish government. Another example is the National Socialist Party Group, led by Count Rosenborg, the brother of Ekström, the ex-wife of Goering. Although these many political groups do not have much power, they attempt to brew a coup, overthrow the government, seize power, and promote Sweden to throw itself under the banner of the German Nazi Party, which is an open secret; if there is no foreign aid to create opportunities for him, of course, he cannot have any achievements. Now that the flames have spread to Scandinavia, making Sweden threatened externally and latent traitors internally, then Quisling's ilk may not appear in Sweden. Himmler, the leader of the German secret police, once publicly said: "In future wars, we will not only have the army on the land front, the navy on the water, and the air force in the air, but we will also have the fourth force on the war stage—Germans inside." This kind of German divide and conquer tactic lurking inside was first seen in Austria, then in Czechoslovakia, third in Danzig, and fourth in Norway; from the point of view of civilization and morality, we wish that it would not be seen a fifth time, and would even disappear from humanity forever.

### Japanese Spokesman Again Claims Respect for Foreigners' Rights and Interests, No Understanding Reached Between the US and Japan on Maintaining the Status Quo of the Dutch East Indies

Tokyo, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman received reporters this morning, he gave a speech based on the Washington official telegram that detailed the meeting between Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi and US Secretary of State Hull, saying that the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and the US Secretary of State had not reached any understanding on maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, and it was not appropriate for Japan and the United States to reach such an understanding. The spokesman continued, when the US Secretary of State inquired the Japanese Ambassador about Japan's attitude towards China, the Japanese Ambassador told him that the Japanese government's intention was to fulfill its guarantee to all countries, maintain China's open door, and show ample respect to third countries in China. The Japanese government's policy of guaranteeing the rights and interests of third countries in China has not changed from beginning to end. The current situation is due to the fact that large-scale wars are still ongoing in China. He hoped that all third countries would be able to understand this environment. A reporter then asked, whether the Japanese Ambassador's meeting with the US Secretary of State resulted in the US and Japan holding the same view on maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. The spokesman replied, the Japanese Ambassador at the time had explained to the US Secretary of State Foreign Minister Arita's remarks made on the 1st of last week regarding the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, and the Japanese government's attitude towards this issue (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)

### US Postmaster General Broadcasts Speech, Supporting the Current Policy

Boston, Postmaster General Farley (one of the Democratic presidential candidates) gave a broadcast speech here last night, expressing his support for the current policy of the United States, which aims to avoid getting involved in the vortex of war, and praised the commercial policy promoted by Secretary of State Hull, advocating that the countries of the Western Hemisphere should cooperate with each other. He said, "The defense of the Western Hemisphere depends on the cooperation of the countries of the Western Hemisphere. As for the basic conditions for the security of the Americas, it lies in not allowing any foreign country to set foot in the New World. If the other parts of the world are always separated by the ocean, three thousand miles away, then the defense problem is very simple, but the United States must have a strong army and navy, so that it can come out and help when its neighbors in the Americas need assistance," (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

### Japanese Newspapers Advocate Compromise with the Soviet Union, While Simultaneously Opposing Anti-American Rhetoric

Tokyo, the newspapers here all claim that the Soviet Union will make new friendly gestures to Japan. Foreign observers attach great importance to this kind of argument, and say that after US Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement on the issue of the Dutch East Indies, advocating maintaining the status quo and avoiding interfering in its internal affairs, the Japanese newspapers immediately took an anti-American tone, and at the same time, suddenly made this kind of speculation about the Soviet Union, which seems to coincide, so it can be seen that a new movement is about to occur in Japan, with progressive revolutionaries as the background, and promoting anti-Americanism as the main doctrine in domestic affairs. According to a diplomatic problem reporter of the Alliance News Agency sending news to Japan, the Soviet Union seems to have the sincerity to resolve various outstanding issues between the Soviet Union and Japan. Although the country still focuses on maintaining neutrality in the European war, it is actually assisting Germany, and is paying attention to the Balkans, the Near East, and India. Because of this, the country must maintain freedom of action in the Far East. Its urgent attempt to improve relations with Japan is probably for this reason. In addition, the Miyako Shimbun holds the same view, and argues that before accepting the Soviet Union's gift, the Japanese government should first carefully observe the Soviet Union's attitude to know whether it is based on sincerity. Although the Soviet Union's attitude has always lacked sincerity, it may not necessarily be the world's response to Japan. If the country can understand the Japanese government's true intention to establish a "New Order in East Asia" and can actively cooperate with Japan, Japan will not hesitate to shake hands with the Soviet Union. The Sino-Foreign Business News also carries that the Soviet government seems to have changed its Far East policy due to the increasing danger of the European war spreading to the Balkans. Under this situation, the country will naturally find it wise to maintain peace on the Siberian border. But the Soviet Union is capricious, and Japan's negotiations with the Soviet Union have never failed. The government authorities must not be negligent (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

### Japanese Demands on the Philippines Arouse Anger of American Congressmen, Considering This a Trojan Horse Tactic of Japan, Hoping the US Government Will Ignore It

Washington, Japan's demand to the United States for special status in the Philippines has aroused the anger of American congressmen today. It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Washington, Horinouchi, requested US Secretary of State Hull last Saturday to use the power of the United States to pressure the Philippine legislature to amend or even abolish the Japanese immigration law. Congressmen have strictly criticized this demand, condemning it as Japan's Trojan horse tactic. Senator Bob Reynolds and Congressman Martin Dies both expressed their opinions, hoping that the government would ignore Japan's demands. Reynolds said, "I don't see any reason why the government should interfere in the internal affairs of the Philippines." Dies said, "Judging from this demand, the Japanese seem to want to use the old trick of the Trojan horse. I very much agree with allowing the Filipinos to be independent in 1946, and at the same time, I think the government must not act on the orders of Japan. It must be known that once the bill is abolished, it is tantamount to putting the Philippine political situation on the path of hara-kiri." Officials here all believe that Hull will convey Japan's views on this issue to the Philippine government without adding any criticism from the United States, so that the Filipinos can decide their own best policy. The opinion of legal authorities here is that the immigration law does not have any strict divisions and does not violate the United States' treaty obligations. It is also reported that Ambassador Horinouchi has argued that in view of the Japanese people's contribution to the Philippines in economic and cultural aspects, the Philippine government should have allowed more Japanese citizens to immigrate to the Philippines (International News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro claimed today that US Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi Kensuke held a meeting yesterday, the theme of which was Japan's opposition to the Philippine authorities' recently passed immigration restrictions. "We feel that maintaining the average rate of Japanese immigration is essential for the continued development of Philippine agriculture. We do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of the Philippines, so we do not make a special request. We feel that the Philippine authorities' limiting the number of Japanese immigrants to 500 is too low, because Japanese women and children who move to the Philippines often return to Japan, which is enough to reduce the natural increase rate of the Japanese people in the Philippines." Suma ended by saying that after Hull and Horinouchi discussed the Philippine issue, Hull inquired Horinouchi about the situation in China. Horinouchi replied that the Japanese government always respects the interests of third countries in China (Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd)

### Europeans Invest in the United States Under False Names, Totaling Over 10 Billion Yuan, Aiming to Prevent Being Seized

The nationality of the investors is not easy to find out, but the official arena believes that a large part of them come from Germany and countries close to Germany (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)

### Japan's Austerity Plan Not Approved by Military; Claims Readiness to Cope with World Situation; Current Military Expenditure Must Not Be Reduced

Tokyo, an Asahi Shimbun report yesterday stated that the government had decided a few days ago, before the completion of the resource mobilization plan, to reduce the expenditures already approved by the Diet. The Ministry of Finance and the Army and Navy Ministries were allowed to begin negotiations, and the authorities of each ministry have already promised to economize. Regarding this matter, a military spokesperson denied it in a statement to the Nichinichi Shimbun, saying that as far as the army is concerned, there is absolutely no possibility of reducing the already approved expenditures for this fiscal year because the army's requested expenditures during the drafting of the budget were already at the "absolute minimum." The Nichinichi Shimbun then commented that if these expenditures are further reduced, it will have extremely unfavorable effects on the formulation of the army's budget for the next few years. "Although the China Incident has reached a new and advantageous stage for Japan, the evolution of the world situation may still lead to unexpected developments. For Japan's sake, we must be prepared to deal with them at any time. Therefore, the army's current expenditure must be maintained." (Havas dispatch from the 21st)

### Sharp Increase in Infant Mortality in Japan

Tokyo, due to the increasing infant mortality rate and declining birth rate in the country, the Ministry of Health and Welfare recently convened a meeting of the heads of health bureaus from various prefectures to discuss remedies. According to the 1938 statistics, the number of infant births nationwide decreased by 250,000 compared to 1937, while the mortality rate saw a sharp increase. When the Ministry of Health and Welfare implemented a preliminary infant health care plan last year, 2 million children underwent physical examinations, and the results were quite satisfactory. At this meeting, it was decided to allocate 860,000 yen for a large-scale infant health test, and the procedures are as follows: (1) The testing period will be from May to September this year. Infants born in 1939, aged two to fourteen months, must be examined by a doctor every three months. (2) The prefectural governors will appoint one doctor in each school district to conduct the examinations, totaling 20,000 doctors nationwide. (3) The prefectural governors must also assign 30,000 qualified midwives and nurses to assist doctors in the examination work, half of the expenses of which will be allocated by the national treasury. (4) Summon 100,000 infant care consultants to ask them to express their opinions on infant care and raising. (5) Request charitable workers across the country to work together to improve infant diets and provide free physical examinations. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)

### Horinouchi's Reception for News Reporters

Peiping, Horinouchi, the Director-General of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated today when he hosted news reporters that the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin would not be lifted, which was a decision arbitrarily made by the Japanese army in Tianjin. This blockade was implemented due to strategic necessity. Before he left Tokyo, the negotiations between the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, had ended, so the Tianjin silver issue could be properly resolved in the near future. As for the progress of the negotiations between the Japanese side and the French authorities, he was unaware, but there was satisfactory progress. Horinouchi came to Peiping today to attend the North China Economic Conference. On Friday, he spoke with the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Mutō; the Japanese Consul-General in Peiping, Shichida; the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, Fujii; and other senior officials. Mutō returned to Tianjin on Saturday to resume his post. Horinouchi went to Tianjin yesterday and returned to Peiping that night. According to Japanese sources, the policy of the Japanese diplomatic authorities in Tianjin has been decided after these meetings. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

Tokyo, the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Suma Yakichiro, recently told the press that the final resolution of the Tianjin silver issue may not be far off. Although the press generally believes that the final resolution can be achieved by the end of April, a definite date cannot be predicted. Actually, the Tianjin silver issue is not a major incident, but technically, it is quite complicated, so the resolution requires a long time. When the press asked whether the Tianjin silver issue and the blockade of the British and French concessions were two separate matters, Suma replied that the nature of these two matters is completely different.

Commander Holtermann was originally an officer of the Norwegian General Staff and studied advanced military science in Paris. (Havas)

German war report claims progress northwest

Berlin, regarding the German army's military actions in the past 24 hours, the headquarters issued a statement this afternoon stating that enemy warships again bombed Narvik yesterday, but there was no attempt to land troops in the German-occupied area. In the Trondheim area, German troops reached important strongholds of military action. No other important battles occurred. In the Bergen area, German troops captured a large number of new-style guns and other military supplies. Land traffic from Oslo to Stavanger is now open. In the Oslo area, German troops advanced north and northwest, defeating the Norwegian army and occupying Lillehammer, Gjøvik, and other places. The enemy suffered heavy losses. British troops attempted to land at Namsos and Åndalsnes, but were thwarted by the German Air Force. Railways and villages occupied by the enemy were destroyed. A British destroyer was hit, and two enemy cargo ships were sunk by German aircraft. The German Air Force also destroyed the enemy fighting north of Hamar and destroyed the enemy's rear railway. It is particularly gratifying that the German army discovered a gunpowder depot in Heidal, storing a large amount of ammunition. This move is of great benefit to the German army. Two enemy submarines were destroyed in Skagerrak and Kattegat. The Norwegian naval shipyard in Horten has begun operations. German aircraft continue to patrol the west coast of Norway and scout the northern North Sea. A British air raid on the Aalborg airfield resulted in three enemy aircraft being shot down, with no losses on the German side. No particularly important events occurred on the Western Front. German planes flew to France for reconnaissance and engaged enemy aircraft several times, shooting down two British and two French aircraft. Three German aircraft did not return to their bases, and one was forced to land in Switzerland due to running out of fuel. (Haitong dispatch from the 22nd)

German Planes Heavily Bomb Three Norwegian Cities

Stockholm, a Havas correspondent telegraphed from central Norway that the Norwegian city of Namsos has been leveled by German aircraft. Steinkjer and Grong were also heavily bombed by German aircraft this morning. However, after the Allied forces landed south of Trondheim, disregarding the German aircraft bombing, they are advancing towards Levanger and Verdal, surrounding the German troops in Trondheim. In addition, when German planes bombed Snåsa, the Havas correspondent happened to arrive at the scene and witnessed the event, seeing three German Junkers planes dropping bombs, targeting the railway and the station, but they missed. According to the correspondent's impression, only the coastal area and the vicinity of the bays in Norway can be battlefields. The outcome of the war depends on the number of Allied and German troops. Now that German reinforcements cannot be transported by sea, and many German airfields in Norway have been destroyed, the United Kingdom and France have an obvious advantage. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)

Allied Forces Achieve Significant Successes in Norway

London, The Times recently published an editorial, stating that the Allied forces have achieved significant successes in Norway, which clearly demonstrates the strength of the British and French naval forces. The conclusion is that the position we occupy is now more advantageous than two weeks ago. If there are other needs in the international situation, a portion of the naval forces can be used elsewhere. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)

German Troops in Trondheim Gradually Becoming Isolated

London, a Reuters military correspondent stated that Trondheim is threatened by Allied forces from both the north and south. The German troops advancing from Oslo are clearly attempting to fight their way through to relieve the garrison isolated in Trondheim. The Norwegian army, using Kongsvinger and Elverum as bases, has been effectively hindering the German advance, and the time delayed by this is of great value to the Allied expeditionary force. At present, the position of the Allied forces not only prevents the German troops from Oslo from reaching Trondheim, but also isolates Trondheim and its bay. However, the above seems to be only one of the objectives of the Allied forces. According to Scandinavian news, British troops have landed at Åndalsnes, south of Trondheim, and are marching to meet the German troops on the east bank of Lake Mjøsa. This shows that the main destination may be Oslo. According to reliable news received in London today, the Norwegian army, whose morale was greatly depressed due to acts of treason in the army, has now fully recovered. Officers and soldiers are striving to perform their duties and are busy forming teams to resist the Germans. It is rumored that the German army would hardly be able to occupy Oslo without forging military orders. It is now reported that the Sigerness Battery on the coast of the Oslofjord is still held by Norwegian troops. The German troops near Elverum have so far failed to break through the line of defense based on Lake Mjøsa. Norwegians have been fighting in the form of guerrillas, often without officers and without military equipment. The British army has found that the Norwegian troops in all the areas they have contacted lack all equipment, but the morale of officers and soldiers is extremely high. From the current situation, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Germans did not initially anticipate that Norway would resist. We believe that the Germans would not rashly send troops to Narvik or use parachutes to land troops before gaining control of the sea. As for the British landing, the German side still does not seem to be fully aware of it. According to reliable news received in London, the British landing has been proceeding smoothly and without any losses. At present, the terrain of the suburbs where the Norwegian army is fighting is mountainous and extremely difficult, requiring small mechanized units. The only artillery that can be used is light mountain artillery. However, the Norwegian army is currently fighting very smoothly, and in some places, it has joined forces with the British army, especially in western Norway, where the two armies have made more contact, and the speed of this contact is quite unexpected. Rumors that Elverum and Hamar have been recovered have not been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

British Military Gear Designed by Explorers

London, according to an announcement by the Minister of Supply, Herbert Burgin, today, the cold-weather equipment for the British troops in Norway was purchased from British and Canadian manufacturers within one month in absolute secrecy and distributed to various army depots within a few hours at the request of the General Staff. No army has ever been so well-equipped in such a short period of time. This is due to the efforts of manufacturers in the country and Canada. This equipment includes special clothing, snowshoes, boots, skis, Arctic tents, wood-burning stoves, and a large number of materials used by explorers. Sigurdur, the son of a famous Arctic explorer, and Smythe, who went to Mount Everest three times, both helped to jointly purchase the items. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

### British Air Force Attacks Northern Denmark Airport Again; Incendiary Bombs Start Large Fires; This Place is a German Air Force Base

London, British bombers attacked the German air force base in Aalborg, northern Denmark, last night again, dropping high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. The airfield was heavily damaged. Fires caused by the air raid are still burning in several places. One British plane is missing. According to responsible sources, the British air raid on Aalborg in northern Denmark on Saturday night came as a complete surprise to the Germans. This was the first raid by British planes on a Danish air base used by the Germans to conduct their Norwegian campaign. The British planes set off separately, and the first to arrive saw the night flight lights of the airfield illuminating the entire airfield. At that time, a large German military transport plane, with its flight lights on, was about to land when it was suddenly strafed by a British bomber with a machine gun and quickly fled into the clouds to avoid being shot down. The British plane then flew low over the airfield, dropping several high-explosive bombs and destroying a large hangar. Before long, other planes arrived one after another and carried out destructive work against ground defenses, but they were met with heavy anti-aircraft fire and machine-gun fire, and they attacked the airfield at various altitudes. After one low-altitude attack, three fires broke out at the airfield. Some British planes that attacked Stavanger on Saturday night also attacked quickly in single and rotating methods. Although they encountered anti-aircraft fire, all the attacking British planes returned safely to their bases. The British planes that attacked Kristiansand also encountered light anti-aircraft fire around the airfield. Anti-aircraft guns placed in the mountains around the airfield also fired fiercely at the British planes, but the British planes only broke one guide wire. It is said that when British planes attacked Aalborg last night, many explosive bombs hit ground targets, and incendiary bombs started six fires. All parts of the airfield are still burning. One pilot flew to a height of 100 feet from the ground and felt that most searchlights could not illuminate such a low altitude, so he was able to hit the road near the control tower with several bombs. A large squadron of long-range bombers attacked the Stavanger airfield. One plane launched a low-altitude attack with ten bombs, hitting fifteen enemy planes parked on the ground, destroying at least six of them, and the rest were likely to be heavily damaged. One plane flew low over the airfield, dropping bombs and causing several fires, while another strafed a line of enemy planes with a machine gun, setting two of them on fire.

In the afternoon, British planes again clashed with German planes, shooting down two more German Messerschmitt planes in French territory. Another one was also destroyed. All British planes returned safely to their bases except for one pilot who was injured, causing his plane to be forced to land. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)

At the time, Losey was assisting in the evacuation of American citizens from the war zone. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)

### German Troops Collect Mineral Oil in Norway; Restrictions on Bank Withdrawals

Oslo, mineral oils in the occupied areas of Norway are extremely scarce. The "Administrative Committee" established by German troops in Oslo has issued an order that lubricating oil used by automobiles, machinery, bicycles, and various engines must not be discarded, but must be stored for refining. The use of mineral oil for painting is also prohibited. In addition, the committee has also implemented restrictions on finance, stipulating that the monthly withdrawal amount for those with current deposits in banks shall not exceed 400 Norwegian kroner, except for the issuance of salaries and alimony.

Both submarines have now returned triumphantly and safely sailed back to their home base today. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)

### Mussolini Urges Nationals to Enhance Military and Economic Power; "Work and Arms" as National Slogan; Corporate System as Economic Foundation; Speech Delivered on Rome Founding Day

Rome: Today is the anniversary of the founding of Rome. Celebrations were held throughout the country. Representatives of the Fascist Party from various provinces went to the Piazza Venezia in front of the Prime Minister's residence to cheer for Prime Minister Mussolini. The Prime Minister immediately appeared on the balcony and delivered a speech, stating that "the Italian people should take work and arms as their slogan."

The goal of this system is to concentrate the nation's strength in order to enhance Italy's military and economic power. (Havas dispatch of the 21st)

Rome: Yesterday was the anniversary of the founding of Italy and National Labor Day. Celebrations were held throughout the country. Ansaldo, the editor of "Telegrafo", gave a radio broadcast, elaborating on the significance of National Labor Day, stating that the Italian people should devote themselves to the work of nation-building for the country's future. The conquest of Abyssinia was a difficult task for Italy to gain living space. In terms of the current conflict, the interests of the state and the workers have become closely linked. The interests of the workers are based on Italy's military strength. From a military point of view, if Italy is a strong country, it will surely be victorious. In the future, the realization of the goals of Fascism, the pursuit of the happiness of workers and the nation, depends entirely on Italy's military weapons. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)

Rome: The whole of Italy celebrated both the anniversary of the founding of Italy and National Labor Day yesterday. In addition to holding banquets, Prime Minister Mussolini also distributed medals and scientific awards from the Royal Academy at the Palazzo Venezia.

The only firm guarantee that Italy is not dragged down lies in the strength of Italy's military. It is said that in Ansaldo's previous speech, the war in Norway may come to Italy, but if the bugle sounds, it will be us who blow it. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)

### European Diplomatic Situation Slightly Eases; Observations from British Political Circles

London: Political figures here have stated that the current diplomatic situation has not only not worsened, but can be said to have eased slightly. There are three indications that can be taken into consideration: Many German "tourists" have successively entered Yugoslavia, and large numbers of German troops have concentrated near Hungary. The general public originally feared that Germany would take action in Southeastern Europe, but so far it has not done so. This is one. Although Italy's opposition to Britain and France has not completely disappeared, it has understood that Britain and France cannot be subdued by force. Britain and France also know that Italy is easily provoked. Therefore, speeches delivered by the British Minister of Economic Warfare, Cross, and the French Prime Minister, Reynaud, warned of the consequences of Italy's involvement in the vortex, while stating that Britain and France are not hostile to Italy and are willing to reach an agreement with it. This expression has been unanimously supported by public opinion in Britain and France. Although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini telegraphed German leader Hitler, expressing that "Germany's victory is assured," the British and French authorities do not regard this as Italy's response to Minister Cross and Prime Minister Reynaud, as Italy has not assisted Germany in the war with force. Therefore, this telegram is to perfunctorily please Germany. This is two. In addition, British-Soviet trade negotiations are about to reopen. This is three. Regarding this matter, although the future is not optimistic because the Soviet Union has stated that it is unwilling to reduce its export volume of certain goods, the British authorities have also published important statistics to prove that Britain has no intention of hindering Soviet trade, but only wants to prevent goods from passing through the Gulf of Bothnia to Germany. As for what Britain and the Soviet Union themselves need, they are very willing to exchange as much as possible. As such, Britain has expressed sincerity. Whether the Soviet Union is truly sincere, or wants to continue to assist Germany, must be proven by facts by the Soviet side. (Havas dispatch of the 21st)

### Belgium's Historical Mission; Belgian Newspaper Discusses Current Situation

Brussels: The Catholic newspaper "Le Soir" has reprinted the views of British newspapers, most of which say that British people believe that Belgium must still fulfill its "historical mission" in this war, becoming a battlefield of the European war. Wilkinson wrote in "The Tidings" that Belgium will once again become a battlefield of the European war. It is almost destiny. It seems superfluous to propose the question of whether Belgium can avoid it today. We believe that what should be discussed today is whether Belgium is willing to be occupied by Germany or by Britain. "Le Soir" commented, saying that the views of British writers are not what we are willing to accept. If Belgium encounters this traditional fate again, it will definitely fight to defend the country.

### German Newspaper Comments on British and French Balkan Policy, Believes They Aim to Encircle Germany

Berlin: Miguel, a foreign affairs correspondent for the Berlin "Financial Times", today wrote an article discussing the Allies' attempt to involve the Balkans in the war, stating: "Recently, the Balkans have become the target of Allied propaganda. From the Danube to the North Sea, rumors have spread, saying that the troops of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union will violate the peace of the Balkans. In fact, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union all want to maintain the peace of the Balkans." Regarding this matter, Miguel mentioned the conversations of Allied politicians on the Balkan issue. Prime Minister Chamberlain said, "The Allies will never treat neutral countries unfairly." Terfugu said, "The Balkan Peninsula does not need to immediately form a solid group to support the Allies in order to defeat Germany militarily. This is imperative and does not need to consult the Balkans themselves." According to a report from British reporter Bryce from the capital of Turkey, the British Foreign Office convened a meeting of ambassadors stationed in Turkey and Greece to discuss how to involve the Balkan countries in the war. Miguel pointed out that for a year, the Allies have automatically provided unnecessary guarantees to countries in Southeastern Europe and the Near East. The purpose is to complete the plan to encircle Germany. However, since the end of the wars in Poland and Finland, although the conflict in Northern Europe is still evolving, it shows the same principle, that the guarantees of Britain and France are insufficient to defend against Germany's blitzkrieg strategy. Today, the Balkan countries probably know that the best way to maintain peace and security is to stay out of the European war. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)

### Soviet Government Commends Navy

Moscow: The Soviet Navy participated in the Finnish War and fought the Finnish Self-Defense Forces with extraordinary bravery. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded various medals. A total of fifteen people received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

### Paris Military Court Tries Communists

Brussels: The First Paris Military Court yesterday tried three key criminals who distributed communist propaganda. Each was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and fined 3,000 francs. The Second Paris Military Court sentenced communist Severt to two years of imprisonment and a fine of 5,000 francs for engaging in defeatist propaganda. The Third Paris Military Court sentenced Italian communist Bacano to five years of imprisonment for engaging in communist propaganda. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)

London: The Secretary-General of the French Socialist Party, Fure, recently sent a letter to the British Labour Party, explaining the reasons for the French government's dissolution of the Communist Party, stating that the measures taken by our government are indeed very severe, but the Communist Party has become a spokesman for another government, and this government is currently assisting the country at war with France. Therefore, if the Communist Party is allowed to continue to exist, it can obey foreign countries, accept their subsidies, participate in the work of our country's parliament, especially various committees, and learn state secrets. How can this be tolerated? (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)

### Bulgaria Not to be Drawn into War Vortex

Sofia: Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov delivered a speech in Lovech in northern Bulgaria, declaring Bulgaria's policy of peace and neutrality to the representatives present. He stated that although the international situation has changed, there is no danger of Bulgaria being drawn into the war vortex. The Balkans as a whole do not seem to be tending to become a battlefield. Because several of the great powers have demonstrated their willingness to maintain peace in the Balkans, the Bulgarian people can work with peace of mind to seek the progress of national culture and material, so that national unity can become more consolidated. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)

### Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations Favorable to Britain, Related to Economic Warfare

London: Well-informed sources say that Foreign Secretary Halifax contacted Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky on Friday for trade negotiations. People here hope that the Soviet side will have a satisfactory response. This move by Britain is a concrete result of the recent consultations between the British Foreign Office and British ambassadors stationed in the Balkans. Diplomatic circles believe that this move by Britain is part of the overall policy of economic warfare against Germany. They claim that concluding a trade agreement with the Soviet Union has the same effect as concluding one with other neutral countries, ensuring that Soviet goods will no longer be transported to Germany. This is very obvious. Concluding a trade agreement with the Soviet Union will allow cooperation to prohibit contraband from being transported from the United States to Germany via Siberia. Therefore, this major loophole in the blockade can be filled. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)

### Yugoslavs Plan to Exchange Agricultural and Industrial Products

Bucharest: A Yugoslav economic delegation, led by former Finance Minister Đorđević, is traveling to Moscow for economic negotiations with the Soviet government. They passed through Romania last night. According to a member of the delegation who spoke to a Havas reporter, "Our chief representative, Đorđević, will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. These negotiations are purely economic in nature. There are many agricultural and industrial products that can be exchanged between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia can sell pigs and tobacco to the Soviet Union in exchange for liquid fuel. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)

### Spanish Interior Minister Delivers Speech

Selfishness should not exist among the people of New Spain. The Falange is the sole political organization in Spain, and its task is to seek the unity and freedom of the country under the leadership of General Franco. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)

### Swiss Army Expresses Willingness to Sacrifice; General Guisan's Speech

Bern: A gathering was recently held here to raise funds for the Red Cross. General Guisan, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, attended and delivered a speech, stating that as of today, the term neutrality is being interpreted in various ways by various parties. We believe that in order to maintain neutrality, we must unite and strengthen ourselves, with the people and the army becoming one. Our current crisis boils down to three points: First, those from abroad should be set aside for the time being. Second, those from within the country, some foreigners are engaging in sabotage in our country, conducting propaganda and spreading rumors. We should not tolerate such actions. Third, some Swiss citizens often fail to understand the seriousness of the situation and the need to accept sacrifice. In short, we are determined to be our own masters. To achieve this goal, no sacrifice is too great. (Havas dispatch of the 21st)

He told the press, "The goal of my trip is to establish closer contacts between our country's foreign envoys and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and to visit dignitaries from various countries and listen to information from all parties in order to gain a general idea of the general situation. There is no other purpose." I also intend to travel to Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Balkan Peninsula, and come to the United Kingdom again before returning home.

### German White Paper - Item 12

Berlin – The German Foreign Ministry last night released the twelfth Polish document, a report from Polish Ambassador to Britain, Raczyński, to the Polish Foreign Minister on March 29, 1939. The report contains three points: (1) the British government's attitude towards the European crisis, (2) its relationship with Poland, and (3) Raczyński's conversation with the US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy. The original text is translated as follows:

"Since the Czechoslovakian incident, British public opinion and the government have undergone great changes, believing that Britain needs strong measures and can no longer tolerate it. However, general appeasers, such as Sir John Simon, all advocate that Britain should take the protection of imperial interests as the premise. Britain can withdraw from Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the scope of German development without any loss. These people also hope that friction will occur between Germany and the Soviet Union, and that Germany will encounter difficulties in occupying Czechoslovakia, so that even if Britain and France withdraw from Eastern and Central Europe, Germany will not be able to rest easy. These appeasers advocate restricting the scope of British interests and also advocate signing a joint declaration between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland. Regarding this matter, the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union is noteworthy. When the British Overseas Trade Minister, Hudson, visited Warsaw, I made a detailed report stating that the British side was extremely willing to increase the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union politically. However, the Soviet Union does not seem enthusiastic. Moscow has attached conditions to the signing of a joint declaration, but the content has not yet been announced. However, it is known that among the conditions put forward by the Soviet Union is the inclusion of Poland as a condition for signing the declaration (Note: This matter was learned by me in the Foreign Ministry, but the Soviet Union denied it). In any case, the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union is not as close as it was when Britain first initiated it. When French President Lebrun visited London, I met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky several times at the reception. He expressed great satisfaction with the recent developments and also saw the recent truth about the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union.

On the 28th of this month, I held talks with the US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy. In accordance with Your Excellency's instructions, I have reported the results of the talks to Director Lubienski, who will forward them to Your Excellency. I asked Kennedy whether the content of his recent talks with Prime Minister Chamberlain on the Polish issue could be revealed to me. Kennedy denied it solemnly, saying that he had not held talks of that nature. At the same time, he expressed surprise at the public discussion of this issue by the US Ambassador to France, Bullitt. Then I asked for his opinion on British military action. Kennedy's answer has been reported by me in detail above. According to Kennedy, if Poland is determined to resist Germany in order to defend Danzig, Britain will inevitably be drawn into the whirlpool. However, whether Poland will be determined to fight Germany for Danzig is something that people here dare not make a rash judgment on. When I mentioned the Soviet Union issue, Kennedy remained silent, unwilling to discuss it much, only hoping that Britain's willingness to cooperate with Poland was more enthusiastic than with the Soviet Union (This opinion is also expressed in today's London newspapers). The above is the expression of Ambassador Kennedy. In addition, London news circles widely report that Kennedy once expressed to the British government that if Britain can support the small countries threatened by Germany, the United States will express great sympathy for it.

### Two US Envoys to the Far East Hold Important Consultations in Japan - Commissioner to the Philippines Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Immediately Went to Tokyo - To Discuss with Grew How to Deal with the Future Situation - US Determined to Maintain the Status Quo

US Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, arrived in Shanghai on the US Asiatic Fleet flagship, the USS Augusta, at 11:00 AM yesterday. The ship was anchored at the naval pontoon in the Huangpu River. US officials in Shanghai went to greet him. It was also reported that the ship ran aground in the southern Philippines on the 23rd of last month, so the US naval personnel in Shanghai, upon hearing the news of the ship's arrival, waited at the dock yesterday morning to learn about the recent situation of their loved ones, making the situation even more lively and tense. Here is a record of Sayre's conversation and other situations:

How to Deal with Drastic Changes in the Situation

According to Sayre, he told a reporter from the Great China News Agency that his trip was to Japan to visit US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, to discuss how to deal with various issues that have arisen after the recent drastic changes in the international situation. The purpose of this trip is to enable the US government and its foreign envoys to maintain closer contact in order to cope with future drastic changes in the situation. However, Sayre denied that this trip would involve discussions with Japan on the Dutch East Indies issue. He said that when he decided to depart, the Dutch East Indies issue had not yet arisen at all. However, he did not deny that this trip might involve discussions with Ambassador Grew in Japan on the general situation in the Pacific.

The Pacific Should Maintain the Status Quo

He said that the general opinion in the United States at present is that it is necessary to maintain the original status quo in the Pacific. He also launched a major attack on countries with a policy of military force, believing that such aggressive behavior is sufficient to destroy thousands of years of human culture that has been painstakingly built up. The US national policy is to maintain these painstakingly built-up crystallization products through humanitarian and legal means. He believes that if the status quo is changed, chaos will follow.

The US and the Philippines are on the Same Page

Regarding the observations of various circles in the Philippines on the Dutch East Indies issue, he said that the Philippines currently has many internal problems, so the attention of the Filipino people is focused on these issues. As for the future situation, it is extremely difficult for us to predict. However, we can assert that the former Philippines and the United States adopt the same view, which is to maintain the balance of power in the Pacific.

The Independence Issue Still Needs to be Considered

When talking about the Philippine independence issue, Sayre said that Philippine independence still awaits the formal approval of the US Senate and House of Representatives. However, he believes that unless there is a major change in the world situation in the next four years, the Philippine independence issue will definitely be realized. But "in any case, it is still difficult for us to predict this issue at present, because this issue still needs to be carefully considered by the US government authorities."

A Short Stay in Shanghai and a Scheduled Trip to Japan

Finally, he also stated that the United States does not currently want to control a larger area. The reason why the US government has been slow to grant the Philippines independence is simply to enable it to gain more autonomy. Sayre is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan on the 28th of this month and is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel and has set up an office at the consulate. He hopes to return to Manila on May 22nd.

The Flagship Has Been Repaired After Running Aground

According to the ship's crew, the ship ran aground at Corong Bay in the southern Philippines. The area there is very narrow, but there has never been any news of reefs in the port. When the ship slowly sailed to the area at dusk to dock, it unfortunately ran aground. Although the hull was not damaged, the propeller was bent, and the rudder was severely damaged, with several ruptures, making it impossible to navigate. Therefore, repair work was carried out. However, due to the small number of workers, it took a lot of time, forcing the ship to remain in Manila for a week.

### Japanese Spokesperson Claims that Abe Has Arrived in Nanjing - Passed Through Shanghai on the Kashima Maru Without Stopping

A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at a press conference yesterday that Abe Nobuyuki departed from Kobe on the 18th, passed through Shanghai on the 21st without stopping, and has now safely arrived in Nanjing. The spokesperson said that Abe is a special envoy of the Japanese government, and it seems too early to call him an ambassador. Tokyo is currently eager for the "Wang Jingwei government" to be recognized by various countries. Only after recognition can Abe be called an ambassador.

Passed Through Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday

General Abe Nobuyuki and his party arrived in Shanghai on the Kashima Maru the day before yesterday. Some say that the Kashima Maru entered the Wusongkou at 6:00 AM, and the Japanese side immediately sent a special boat to the center of the river to welcome Abe ashore. Others say that Abe landed at the Huishan Wharf at 3:00 PM under strict guard. Due to the Japanese side's strict secrecy, Japanese news agencies and newspapers were prohibited from publishing yesterday and the day before yesterday, so it is impossible to verify. However, the New Shenbao editorial yesterday revealed the news, saying that Abe arrived in Shanghai at dawn.

The So-Called Mission

According to news from the Japanese side, after Abe goes to Nanjing, he will begin to review the treaty on the "peace plan" based on the three principles of Konoe that the Chinese government and people oppose. He plans to turn the established facts into conditions, and then turn the conditions into laws. Then Japan can use this condition to annex Manchuria and Mongolia, block Central China, and control South China, from the Heilongjiang River in the north to Hainan Island in the south, up to the sky's weather, down to the underground mineral deposits, and in the middle from east to northwest, from territorial waters to inland rivers, all occupied and controlled, completely excluding the rights and interests of third countries and expelling third countries from the Far East. It can be seen that Abe's trip is of great importance.

### The Income Tax Office Encourages Informants - 1% as Reward

The excessive profit tax during the emergency period has been levied since January 1, 1939. This excessive profit tax is an excellent wartime tax system. After the levy, it will increase tax revenue and enrich war expenses, which is still its decision. Its important significance lies in realizing the principle of saving the country by having money contribute money and balancing the burden on society. All industries have uniformly complied. Now, the Income Tax Office has reported that a small number of merchants have forged books or reported excessive expenses in an attempt to reduce the tax amount. Therefore, five regulations for rewarding informants have been formulated. If a taxpayer has illegal intentions to reduce the amount of tax payable, someone who informs will be rewarded with 10% of the tax payment. This bonus can be applied for by the informant to the local office after the tax payment is paid.

### Lockhart to Succeed as US Consul General in Shanghai - Currently Still in Peiping and Will Return Home - Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai from the US in Early September to Take Office

Since Gauss resigned from the post of US Consul General in Shanghai, his duties have been temporarily handled by the administrative consul. It is now learned that Washington has decided to appoint Lockhart, Counselor of the Embassy in Peiping, to succeed Gauss as US Consul General in Shanghai. Lockhart is currently still in Peiping, but it is said that

Before Taking Office

He will return home for a trip. He is scheduled to go to Kobe from Peiping first, and then take the President Coolidge to the United States on the 16th of next month to meet with the authorities for instructions, make a small stay, and then take the President Coolidge to Shanghai again in early September to take office. He is still a Counselor of the US Embassy. Lockhart has served as US Consul General in China several times and is very familiar with

China Situation

He is very familiar with the situation in China, and his transfer to Shanghai this time will definitely be welcomed by all circles in the city. He has served in US government agencies for more than 26 years. He came to China in 1920 and served as the US representative at the tariff conference held in Peiping. On April 15, 1925, he was appointed as the Consul General in Hankou. In 1931, he was appointed as the

Consul General in Tianjin

In 1935, he was appointed as Counselor of the US Embassy in Peiping and has been there for 20 years, achieving considerable labor. In September of last year, when Gauss left Shanghai for Manila, he briefly stayed in Shanghai and then returned to Peiping.

### Overseas Chinese Remitted 500 Million Yuan Last Year

Since the Chinese government encouraged overseas Chinese to remit money to their homeland, overseas Chinese compatriots in various places have enthusiastically remitted money. It is reported that the amount of money remitted by overseas Chinese in the United States last year exceeded the amount of the previous year. According to statistics released by the US Post Office, this remittance reached US$35 million last year, accounting for about 16% of China's trade deficit last year. This type of figure is encouraging to those who hear it. If calculated according to the Shanghai black market foreign exchange rate, one US dollar is equivalent to 16 yuan in national currency, then the total amount is 530 million yuan.

### Work at British United Shipyards Comes to a Standstill - Boat Hires—Also Go on Strike - More Than Double the Number of Striking Workers

Since the British United Shipyards labor strike occurred, it has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. According to the workers' side yesterday, it is believed that in the near future, the scope of the labor strike will expand, and even any part of the company's work will come to a standstill. Since the end of last week, the kitchens and some assistants on the ships belonging to British United have also announced a strike, unanimously expressing sympathy for the shipyard workers, hoping that the company can understand the seriousness of the situation and find a way to mediate as soon as possible. Although it has not yet extended to Chinese employees in the Yangshupu Company, according to news from the workers' side, they are already uneasy and may join soon. However, the workers' side still hopes that the company authorities will hold negotiations and obtain a satisfactory solution. They also firmly deny that there is any background instigating this strike. What they are asking for is "how to adapt to the current living needs." This labor strike originated in the Yangshupu Yesson Shipyard, and then workers in various shipyards in Pudong joined, so that the number of striking workers has increased from 600 to 1,500.

### Workers at the Scientific Can Factory Will Endure and Resume Work - A Uniform Salary Increase of Four Yuan - Workers Submit Guarantees

More than 150 workers at the Chinese-owned Scientific Iron Printing and Can Making Factory at 609 Route Tenant de la Tour, French Concession, requested that the employer improve their treatment due to the painful threat to their livelihoods, resulting in a go-slow. It has now been resolved, and the course of events is recorded as follows:

Requests Unsuccessful

The Scientific Iron Printing and Can Making Factory is operated by Chinese businessmen and is large in scale. More than 150 workers in the factory felt that their wages were meager. In this autumn of continuously rising living costs, what they earned was not enough to maintain themselves. Therefore, on the 14th of this month, they submitted four requests for improved treatment to the factory director and engineers: (1) Wages below 30 yuan will be increased by 30%, and those below 20 yuan will be given more as appropriate. (2) Night work will be restored to six hours per shift. (3) Workers who are sick will be given meal allowances. (4) Year-end bonuses will be issued for one month. After the requests were submitted, the factory did not respond. On the 16th, the workers asked the Department of Political Affairs of the French Municipal Council to send someone to mediate, but it was still unsuccessful. The workers then began a go-slow on the afternoon of that day.

Employer's Conditions

On the 17th, the workers again asked the Department of Political Affairs to mediate, but they still failed to get the point. On the 18th, the factory posted a notice proposing three conditions: (1) Implement a contract system. (2) The number of workers to be hired must be determined based on the amount of work. Workers without work will still receive a monthly meal allowance of 11 yuan. (3) Wages will be determined based on work ability. The labor side felt that these conditions were too far apart and could not be accepted. On the 19th, the factory posted another notice, saying that the factory was operating at a loss. If the workers were willing to work, they should register before the 23rd. Those who were unwilling would be dismissed with one month's severance pay. All workers would receive a uniform salary increase of four yuan. The labor side, feeling that there was no way to appeal, went to register. On the 20th, the factory again proposed that the workers must submit guarantees before they could enter the factory to work. In order to take the overall situation into consideration, the labor side had to endure and accept it. Once all the guarantees are submitted to the factory, work can be resumed.

### Increase in Monthly Season Tickets for British Public Buses - Passengers Decreased by Two-Tenths - But Revenue Increased Instead

A notice from the Public Bus Company of the International Settlement stated that due to rising prices, the company was forced to increase the prices of monthly season tickets from May 1, 1940, as follows: (1) Ordinary monthly season tickets: adults 24 yuan per month (originally 16 yuan), children 12 yuan per month (originally 8 yuan). (2) Special bus monthly season tickets: adults 38 yuan per month (originally 24 yuan). Ordinary monthly season tickets cannot be used on special express buses, while special monthly season tickets can be used on all buses. A reporter from Dagang News Agency inquired with the company yesterday. Since the increase in fares, the number of passengers has decreased by two-tenths, but the revenue from tickets has increased. Before the price increase, the total daily operating revenue was about 16,000 yuan, and after the price increase, it is about 18,000 yuan (excluding the revenue from monthly season tickets). The decrease in the number of people after the price increase is actually a phenomenon that should have occurred after each price increase. If one or two months pass, the original number of people can be restored. At that time, the daily revenue from tickets can be increased to about 23,000 to 24,000 yuan.

### Women's Circles in the City Strive for National Assembly Delegate Seats

The women's circles in the city believe that the National Assembly convened by the government on November 12th this year is approaching in a blink of an eye. In order to respond to the delegate quotas in various places, they have held many meetings to discuss. They all believe that the KMT party platform and the constitutional provisions this time stipulate that women are equal to men in law, politics, and society. However, the number of representatives often elected by women seems to be too small. Proposals concerning women themselves may be incomplete, and if there are not many female representatives in the council, they will also be neglected and rejected. It is necessary to send telegrams to the central government to appeal. Now the Shanghai Women's National Assembly Delegate Election Committee has issued a declaration to awaken the attention of the women's circles in the city. The general idea advocates that (1) the representatives legally elected above are not considered invalid except for those who defected to the enemy, and the seats that were canceled due to defection to the enemy should be filled by women as much as possible. (2) Shanghai is the national cultural center, and the number of talents is naturally more than in other places, so more convenience should be given.

### Japanese Troops Build Camps at Hongqiao Airport - Green Cloth Curtains Rise - War is Imminent

The Japanese army carried out a large-scale massacre near Zhuzhai Town, and more than 100 villagers died. The town was fortunate not to be affected. The situation has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the Japanese army in the Hongqiao area is now building barracks at the Hongqiao Airport, fearing the possibility of being attacked by guerrillas. Japanese soldiers have been stationed in the lookout posts. It is reported that the guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai have recently become active again.

Field Crops

Have grown tall, using them to conceal themselves, attack Japanese soldiers, and kill several. The Japanese army then carried out severe retaliation. "According to what has now been confirmed, on the morning of the 15th of this month, the Japanese army arrived at Zhuzhai Town, which is not a few miles away from Hongqiao Airport, accusing civilians of hiding guerrillas, and massacred no fewer than 400 civilians and burned 800 rafters of houses to vent their anger. However, there were no guerrillas in the town at that time. After the Japanese soldiers set the fire, they

Poured Kerosene

To make the fire more intense, and opened fire on the civilians who escaped. A few days ago, the Japanese army again set fire and massacred innocent people in a village in the suburbs of Shanghai. The wife of a certain sampan owner was hit by a stray bullet and was sent to the Shanghai General Hospital for treatment on the 19th and died of serious injuries on the 21st." etc. The exact situation in Zhuzhai is still unknown. Let's record it first and wait for proof.

### Returning the Railway is Just a Beautiful Fantasy - The Japanese Side Issued a Bill to Demand Huge Sums of Money - This Amount is Enough to Build Two New Railways

According to foreign sources, before the establishment of the Nanjing "regime," it asked the Japanese side to return the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. The Japanese side readily agreed, and then made a counter-request, listing a bill with detailed items, demanding huge sums of money before they would return the railway, including (A) the cost of transferring locomotives and passenger cars from the South Manchuria Railway, (B) the cost of repairing damaged tracks and bridges, and (C) road costs, including the salaries of puppet troops and life compensation costs. The exact total amount of these expenses has not yet been heard, but it is said that the amount is at least enough to rebuild the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways with some remaining. The rumored remarks of the "Minister of Railways" are even more depressed. He feels that there is no hope of recovering the two railways unless he can raise huge sums of money one day to rebuild the two railways, but this is just wishful thinking. It is learned that Chuan Shishuo once told his friends that what is under the jurisdiction of the "Ministry of Railways" he "presides over" is only a narrow-gauge railway three English miles long, which is the light railway from Xiaguan in Nanjing to the city.

### Famous American Writer Emory Observed the Trends of the European War - It is Not Impossible for the Battle Line to Extend Southward - Britain and France Have the Advantage in Economic Terms

The English-language Great American Evening Post stated that Dr. Emory, a famous American international and economic affairs writer, came to the Far East to conduct research and recently arrived in Shanghai. He spoke freely to reporters about the international situation, saying that the United States must now "pay close attention" to Europe and the Far East. The development of the European situation will inevitably have a strong impact on the Far East.

US Fleet Posture

However, the United States' maintaining a fleet in the Pacific is not a posture to deal with Japan. Its purpose is to maintain the status quo in the Pacific. Moreover, the US fleet has been stationed in the Pacific for several years. If it is transferred to the Atlantic, it will only increase the tension in the European situation. The outbreak of the war in the Scandinavian Peninsula is the beginning of the expansion of the European war front and may promote the early outbreak of the war in the Balkan Peninsula.

Trend of the Battle Line

Because after Germany invaded Denmark and Norway, the Allied countries may take action in the Balkan Peninsula and on the Turkish-Soviet border. Germany's motivation for invading Norway is to prevent the Allied countries from strengthening their control over the region. Sweden seems to have long had a plan to occupy Denmark and Norway, but it is waiting for the Allied countries to act first. In Denmark, Germany may be able to obtain some metals, but Norway does not have valuable raw materials, so the most important gain for Germany in this victory over Norway should be strategic benefits, that is, to ensure the transportation of Swedish iron sand and other necessary goods to Germany and to prevent the Allied countries from gaining an important position to strengthen their blockade.

The situation in Northern Europe

There is little hope that the war in Northern Europe will be localized, and Sweden is now in danger of being invaded and may not be able to avoid direct participation in the war. It is not impossible for the Allied countries to use troops against Romania to attack Germany and control the Romanian oil fields. At this point, war will also break out in the Balkan Peninsula, and the Soviet Union will supply oil to Germany. The Allied countries may decide to intercept it to strengthen the blockade against Germany. Then large-scale war will break out along the entire line from Northern Europe to the Near East, or even drag the Soviet Union into the war.

Judgment of Advantages and Disadvantages

In terms of economic warfare, Britain and France have a great advantage, as do the navies. The organization and training of the German army are excellent, but the talent of its supreme commander is probably inferior to that of the German army commander during the World War. Dr. Emory is scheduled to go to Nanjing today (the 22nd) and then return to the United States via the Philippines.

### China International Radio to Broadcast Special Programs Aimed at Entertaining Foreigners Beyond the Coastline - Two-Hour Broadcasts Every Sunday Evening - Many Former Shanghai Foreigners Also Participating

The English-language "China Press" reports that China International Radio, located in Sichuan with call sign XGOY, wavelength 25.21 meters, or 11900 kilocycles, has added a new two-hour program every Sunday evening called "Voice of China's Sunday Evening Program," aimed at entertaining foreigners beyond the Chinese coastline. In addition to musical programs, it includes short, special segments.

Shanghai Reception

The broadcast time is from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM. Shanghai listeners are expected to find this special program particularly interesting, as several foreigners who previously resided in the city participate in the radio station's broadcasts on a regular weekly basis. For example, the American female writer, Miss Emily Hahn, broadcasts for fifteen minutes each time, reciting English translations of Chinese poetry accompanied by appropriate

Chinese Music

Mrs. Du Ting, Mrs. Bernfield, and Mrs. Graham broadcast for ten minutes, reporting on life in Chongqing through the eyes of foreigners in a chatty style. Mrs. Du Ting previously taught at the American School in Shanghai and has resided in China for a long time. Her husband is a correspondent for the New York Times. Mrs. Bernfield is currently responsible for the publicity of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives and previously worked as a correspondent for the United Press in Peiping for many years. Mrs. Graham currently works at China International Radio and previously served as a news editor for the English-language "China Press" weekly.

News Editor

Another special program is "Voice of China's Questions and Answers." This type of question program is extremely popular in the United States. Questions related to China that are of public concern can be addressed to the International Radio Station, and the station will answer them as quickly as possible in this program. In addition, musicians are invited weekly to perform ancient Chinese music and

Beautiful Songs

Including a solo performance of the Guqin on the 7th of this month and a solo performance of a Chinese lullaby by Ms. Hong on the 14th of this month. The International Radio Station has requested listeners to provide criticism of this two-hour program and welcomes any suggestions. Letters can be sent to China International Radio, P.O. Box 107, Chongqing.

### Dredging Work to Begin Next Month

Since the Japanese returned the dredgers of the Huangpu River to the Dredging Bureau, the various machines and surveying equipment have been awaiting repair, so the dredging work has not yet resumed. It is reported that the dredging work, under the supervision of the Japanese, will begin in mid-May.

### Norwegian Residents Sever Commercial Ties

According to news from foreign residents in this city, since the expansion of the European war and the establishment of a state of war between Germany and Norway, German and Norwegian residents in this city have now ceased all commercial relations and broken off contact. The reporter confirmed this with the Norwegian Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday. According to the Norwegian Consul General, T. Knudtzon, "The severance of commercial relations between Norwegian residents in Shanghai and German residents is a voluntary act by the Norwegian residents, and the Norwegian Consulate has not issued any such order." It is estimated that there are about 700 to 800 German merchants and about 200 Norwegian merchants residing in Shanghai. It is also reported that when the Soviet-Finnish war broke out, the Japanese spread the news that the Soviet Union would restore its consulate in Shanghai, but until recently, the Soviet Union has not restored its consulate in Shanghai, nor is it prepared to do so. The reporter inquired about this matter at the Norwegian Consulate General in Shanghai, which stated that "Soviet citizens in Shanghai are still being represented by the Norwegian Consulate as usual. As for the previous statement that the Soviet Union would restore its consulate in Shanghai, nothing has been heard of it so far."

### Changes in the Economic Review Committee Membership - The Japanese Can No Longer Exploit It - Committee Members from Various Countries to be Elected by Residents

At the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 17th of this month, the Japanese proposed the establishment of an Economic Review Committee with ten members. However, after a vote by all foreign taxpayers, the result was that the ten members were changed to twelve and passed, namely two each from China, Britain, the United States, and Japan, and one each from Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. According to this newly organized committee, its power is second only to the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council. Fortunately, the foreign taxpayers at the annual meeting modified and passed the Japanese proposal, making it impossible for them to exert any influence. According to a report from the reporter of the "Ping Ming News Agency" to the relevant departments of the Municipal Council, the members of the Economic Review Committee will be produced by the residents of various countries according to the number of seats, that is, two British and American members will be elected by the British and American Residents Associations, respectively. The Japanese members will be nominated by the Japanese Residents Group. In addition, one member each from Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands will also be nominated by the residents groups of each country. As for the two Chinese members, they will be nominated by the Chinese Taxpayers Association. Currently, various parties in China and abroad are separately nominating suitable individuals to serve as members. The Municipal Council will formally announce the list of names as soon as all the residents' groups have nominated their representatives.

### Goods to be Marked with Prices - All Industries Preparing - Sample Price Lists Distributed - Hoarding and Profiteering to be Severely Punished

Since the authorities of the two concessions announced that all shops and markets must mark the prices of goods for sale, all parties have hoped to see it implemented as soon as possible. It is now learned that all shops and markets are preparing after receiving the sample price lists, and are determined to follow the regulations of the authorities and act in unison. It is also heard that the industry associations have also decided to assist in the implementation of this matter, in order to make it universal. They believe that marking prices not only facilitates public selection and purchase, but also benefits the shops themselves. After all, price chaos only leads to the disappearance of social purchasing power, which results in reduced sales and stagnant funds for shops, which is equivalent to suffering losses. The authorities of the two concessions are now determined to do their utmost to suppress and stabilize prices. If merchants hoard and profiteer, or if non-merchants use speculative funds to stimulate prices, they will be strictly prosecuted and punished. It has been decided, in consultation with the courts, that the penalties of a few days' detention and fines in accordance with the police regulations are too light, and they will be punished in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the government for punishing unscrupulous merchants.

No Price Limits for Now

The French Concession Price Stabilization Committee and the Public Concession Price Control Committee, acting in parallel, have successively published average price lists of daily necessities by the Price Stabilization Committee and the Health Department on the 13th and 17th of this month. It has been decided in principle that the first step is to publish the prices of necessities for residents to refer to, and no price limits will be set for the time being. In the future, if residents encounter merchants who are not satisfied with reasonable profits, excessively raise prices, or resort to tricks and fraud, they can report them to the police for investigation and punishment.

French Consulate Announcement

The French Consul General's Order No. 158 reads as follows: "In order to enforce the law, in accordance with Article 2 of this Consulate's Order No. 78 of February 19, 1940, and the resolution of the meeting of the Price Stabilization Committee for Necessities of April 4, 1940, the following order is issued: Article 1: This order applies to all merchants who retail the items listed in the attached table. Article 2: These merchants shall post an abstract of the price list of daily necessities sold outside the shop or in a place easily visible on the road. The price list must be marked in French or English, but for Chinese or Russian customers, a separate table may be established in Chinese or Russian and posted next to the price list. Article 3: All goods for sale, whether inside or outside the store, shall be affixed with a price tag indicating the price per retail unit (such as per kilogram, per piece, per dozen, per centimeter, etc.). The indicated price shall be in Arabic numerals, the size of which shall not be less than three centimeters. Article 4: Any first-time violation of this Consulate's order shall be given a warning; any subsequent violation shall be subject to a fine of one to five hundred yuan. After being punished by the Consul General's Office, the business license may also be revoked. Article 5: The warnings and punishments stipulated in the above article may be announced or published by the Consular Police Department. Article 6: The provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of this Consulate's Order No. 34 of January 29, 1940, shall apply to the price disclosure methods of this Consulate's order. Article 7: This Consulate now directs the Commissioner of Police to implement it. April 12, 1940, Consul General Baudais."

### Charity Broadcast for Zhongshan Refugees Ends

The charity broadcast held by all circles in Shanghai at the Glass Radio Station of the New Capital Hotel ended last night. Famous actors, singers, famous courtesans, and entertainment artists all participated voluntarily.

### "Roulette King" - Garcia Returns with a Vengeance - Concession Authorities Closely Monitoring

According to news from foreigners, the gambling tycoon, Mexican Garcia, known as the "Roulette King," has recently come to Shanghai again, waiting for an opportunity to act. It has been found that Garcia opened a large-scale roulette gambling den at No. 151 Jing'an Temple Road in this city twelve years ago. The concession authorities cracked down on it on April 22, 1928.

Later, it was cracked down on by the police authorities. Now that the Western District of Shanghai is full of smoke and gambling, Garcia has returned with a vengeance, hiding in Shanghai. It is heard that the authorities responsible for security are closely monitoring Garcia's whereabouts.

### Securities - Reasons for the Big Rise in Wheelock Marden Shares - Domestic Debt Affected by Banking Factors

The unofficial securities market continued to fall sharply yesterday. All stocks were under pressure due to tight funds, and sellers continued to arrive. This shortage of money is due to very complex reasons. Bund banks are absorbing cash for interest arbitrage, and interest rates are increasing. Foreign stock prices have suddenly soared, requiring a large amount of cash, so the discount rate is high. Banks are rushing to collect money at the end of the month, and those going long are paying interest as high as 3%. Most of the above have prices but no market. The silk and tea business is gradually starting, requiring huge amounts of money, and banks must also prepare funds. Therefore, when applying for loans from banks, they are rejected except for a very few who have connections. Although this phenomenon is a temporary supply and demand relationship, it has deeply affected the government bond market and it will be difficult to activate it within this month. Although the market price has fallen quite a bit, it has not yet caused it to rise rapidly. Even if there is a recovery, it will be short and small. Yesterday was still spent in a gradual state of weakness. Although No. 38, Renchang, and Lianhe bought in the morning and afternoon, and others such as Tiansheng, Tongshun, Yongkang, Dafeng, and Hengfu Tongyu also bought in first, the selling pressure was still strong. For example, Shunkang and Lianyi continued to sell constantly, and a steady stream of spot goods continued to flow out from Hongda, Taifeng, Shuntai, Shengda, and Tongkang. Although the market price recovered slightly in the afternoon, the trend was still extremely weak and listless. At best, the future will see a temporary consolidation, and the rising trend is not yet the time. As a result, it continued to fall by 3 to 5.5 jiao, and the total number of transactions was 1.56 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 50 shares of Great China Match were traded at a price of 25.75 yuan.

The foreign stock market situation was strong and lively yesterday, beyond words, due to the weekend news, which was all favorable to the bulls. What Wheelock Marden shares encountered was especially glorious and extremely splendid. The company recently announced the issuance of new shares, coupled with external rumors that the Far East shipping costs will proportionally increase. Both of these are the main factors for its repeated surge. The highest price was 272 yuan, which caused those with rights to sell wildly. If the market situation is excellent, the decline should not be limited to a few yuan. National, Yangtsze, Jardine and other stocks are in great public demand. China Land Reclamation shares rose to 29 yuan, and were also outstanding. Rubber stocks had been neglected for several weeks and have recently bloomed like sturdy grass in a strong wind. Compared to the sharp rise of industrial stocks, the price of rubber stocks has recently been lower than it was a few weeks ago, which is illogical.

The capital of Wheelock Marden & Company is set at 10 million taels of silver, divided into 1 million shares. The face value of the stock is 10 taels of silver, and the paid-up capital is 2,393,600 taels of silver, for a total of 239,360 shares. The company convened a board meeting last Saturday, April 20), and decided to continue issuing 239,360 new shares from the uncollected capital, to be subscribed equally by old shareholders, with one old share being able to purchase one new share. The issue price of the new shares is 25 yuan in national currency. All shareholders registered before May 4 of this month can apply for subscription. The deadline for subscription and payment of shares by shareholders in the Far East is May 24. The date from which the new shares will accrue interest is set to begin on April 1 of this year.

### Hutchison Rubber Shares Pay Dividends

The 30th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Hutchison Rubber Limited, managed by Hutchison & Company, will be held on May 3. The final dividend for 1939 is proposed to be 7.5 jiao in national currency, for a total of 1.75 yuan in national currency including the interim dividend.

### Finance - US Dollar Exchange Turns to Selling, Flowing Continuously

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listed rates. The unofficial British and American exchange rates continued to strengthen. This was because there were no new developments in the European situation and the exchange rate had already rebounded to its previous high. Market transactions were entirely concentrated on arbitrage and swaps. Today, Chinese merchants were willing to pay a premium of 2.5 cents for spot US dollars to sell May contracts. The swap difference between spot and May contracts required paying out 0.28125. At the opening this morning, gold was flat, and the US dollar was strong at 0.03125. Although speculators and outsiders with gains occasionally sold, the underlying trend remained quiet. It was only heard that the Tianjin exchange rate was weak. Speculators were reluctant to accept forward contracts for pounds sterling, while US dollars were still flowing out in a continuous stream. The afternoon situation was extremely quiet. The loosening trend for US dollars in the current month was most evident. Therefore, the closing prices for spot and May contracts were similar to the opening prices this morning, while the current month was hard at 0.03125.

Most Transactions Were Arbitrage

This morning, the exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai dollars, French francs, etc., were all flat. The US dollar was up two points against the British pound, unchanged against the Japanese yen, and up one point against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening selling prices for spot exchange rates at banks this morning were 4 shillings and 1.125 pence for British gold and 6.03125 yuan for US dollars. Compared to last Saturday, the British pound was flat and the US dollar was up 0.03125, due to the rebound in the exchange rate. At the same time, futures contracts also opened slightly lower. After the opening, the market still appeared strong, but trading was not very active. Chinese merchants continued to engage in arbitrage and swap transactions. It was heard that Chinese merchants were willing to pay a premium of 2.5 cents for spot US dollars to sell May futures, and a premium of 0.21875 for entering April and selling May. Furthermore, many bulls sold spot and bought back May futures, willing to pay out 0.28125. Swapping April for May required paying out 0.21875. The HSBC listed rates remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Subsequently, speculators and outsiders with gains all sold, but the market outlook remained the same. It was calculated that speculators gave Chinese banks a price of 5.71875 yuan for May US dollars, and that beneficial parties sold May British gold to Chinese merchants at 3 shillings and 9.0625 pence. There were no changes until the afternoon. The closing prices were 4 shillings and 1.125 pence for spot British gold and 6.03125 yuan for US dollars, the same as the opening prices this morning.

Both Spot and Futures Prices Loosened

The afternoon was unusually quiet. Only outsiders were willing to sell May British gold to Chinese merchants at a price of 3 shillings and 9.0625 pence. Until the evening closing, the situation changed. The closing prices were 4 shillings and 1.125 pence for spot British gold, 6.03125 yuan for US dollars, 4 shillings and 10.078125 pence for April British gold, 5.96875 yuan for US dollars, 3 shillings and 9.0625 pence for May British gold, and 5.6875 yuan for US dollars. In the end, spot British pounds were flat and US dollars were firm by 0.03125. April contracts loosened, British gold by 0.015625 and US dollars by 0.0625. May contracts for both British pounds and US dollars were firm by 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively.

### Tightening Money Supply - Gold Market Declines

Yesterday, the unofficial market for cash gold saw a decline because the money supply became increasingly tight today. Discount rates for bank drafts had already exceeded the 100 yuan mark, so the bearish trend remained unabated. Prices moved downward, but the decline was limited because people were not discouraged by the low prices. There were many people who saw an opportunity to buy. Because the foreign exchange market reported gains this morning, the opening price was lowered by 35 yuan compared to Saturday, opening at 5,755 yuan. After a while, the banks helped the gold shops, and a buying mood emerged, causing the price to rebound to 5,775 yuan. Soon, money changers and securities firms aggressively sold, and the price could not be sustained, falling to 5,750 yuan, the lowest price of the day. Later, it rebounded by 20 yuan, but the afternoon closing price was only 5,755 yuan. The market atmosphere had already changed before the afternoon opening. The price had already risen to 5,780 yuan upon opening, but because retail investors continued to sell, the supply exceeded demand, and the price eventually closed at 5,770 yuan. The market declined by 20 yuan overall. Trading volume for the day was about 2,000 taels. Jewelry gold was listed 5 yuan lower, while customs gold remained flat.

Cash Gold Falls by 20 Yuan

From the morning, with the exchange rate reported high and the US dollar loosening, the market sentiment was bearish, and the opening price immediately fell by 35 yuan. Money changers sold 50 taels of gold to gold shops for 5,755 yuan. Later, some gold shops were willing to buy, and banks followed suit, immediately rebounding by 20 yuan. Banks traded 20 taels of gold amongst themselves for 5,775 yuan. After that, securities firms and money changers competed to sell aggressively. Although a certain gold shop continuously bought on behalf of customers, they felt overwhelmed. The price fell by 25 yuan. Gold shops sold 10 taels to securities firms, at a loss, for 5,750 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, gold shops suddenly had the intention to buy, and relied on a certain gold shop to continue to buy in, and the sellers gradually decreased, so the price rebounded by 20 yuan. Gold shops bought 30 taels from banks for 5,770 yuan. Near closing, the buyers stopped their activity, and money changers came to sell again, dropping another 15 yuan. Money changers sold 30 taels to gold shops for 5,755 yuan. After the closing, the buying mood rebounded, and securities firms turned from selling to buying, immediately raising the price by 10 yuan.

The price fluctuated by 30 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand of gold was several yuan higher than the cash gold price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current price of gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little activity.

Jewelry Gold Down Another 5 Yuan

Initially, major jewelry stores were still quoting 585 yuan per tael for jewelry gold. At 9:40, the price was lowered by 5 yuan. There were no changes after that. The major jewelry stores changed their quote to 580 yuan. New jewelry stores had the same price as the old ones, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Loosening Trend for Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw funds flow into foreign stock markets, resulting in tighter money supply and weaker purchasing power for foreign currencies. Coupled with the rising trend in British gold prices, buyers became hesitant. British and American gold pounds continued to fall by 0.5 yuan. The market for British gold notes was also soft. American gold notes initially traded at 16.52 yuan, then rose to 16.55 yuan, and then fell back to 16.46 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell further to 16.44 yuan, and finally closed at 16.45 yuan, down 0.1 yuan compared to last Saturday.

The supply of Korean notes was also smooth, and the evening market fell to 1.01 yuan. Other currencies remained stable.

The Money Dealers Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 0.2 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Yarn and Cotton - Although Actual Demand is Weak, Yarn Market Still Looking Up

The yarn market is hovering with a tightening trend. This is because the market sentiment is good and yarn prices are still expected to rise. Therefore, although the US dollar has appreciated and the Huang Yu has loosened, the yarn market has not been affected and remains firm. Some say this is because spot goods are running out and the base is tight. However, the actual need is turning towards a weaker path. Now,

The yarn market opened well in the morning, and asking prices were very high, but there were few buyers. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,385 yuan, and the factory price was 1,370 yuan. Few accepted this price at the opening, and prices quickly fell back. At the same time, customer sales were weak, falling by more than 10 yuan. However, some parties, seeing the low prices, bought in a few dozen bales, and the market rebounded to more than 10 yuan. The Double Horse factory price reached 1,385 yuan. The total turnover for half a day was 1,650 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse factory yarn rose by 10 yuan. Yesterday, 1,210 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 45 pieces were shipped to Haikou. The amounts purchased by various brokers are listed below:

Counterparts: 130
Hong Kong: 190
Inland: 10
Tianjin: 100
Total: 1,651

### Spot Indian Cotton Selling Price More Than 20 Yuan Higher Than Contract Price

The cotton market is unusually sluggish because the factories have no interest in buying, so market sentiment is mediocre. In addition, Indian cotton has been arriving from overseas recently, increasing inventory, so the cotton market feels particularly weak. Selling prices cannot rise and are bearish, which is very different from the yarn market. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed below:

2 Extra American Varieties: Counterparts purchased 200 bales at 310
Ordinary Good Er: 197 yuan, also 600 pieces at 198 yuan
Omra: 231 yuan, also 200 pieces
Dazhong Collection Packing: 247 yuan, also 140 pieces
General Packing: 224 yuan, also 200 pieces
Mitlin: 294 yuan, also 100 pieces

There has been another shipment of North Sha Songhua cotton. Yesterday, the Portuguese ship Avi Maria arrived in Shanghai from Qinglong Port, carrying 831 bales of cotton, which were transported away by customers using trucks. Today, 500 bales are being shipped to Tianjin for export.

In other news, foreign cotton prices. The New York cotton market initially fell due to mass selling, but later stabilized due to the strength of Wall Street and short covering. As a result, the market closed firmly, with both near-term and far-term contracts rising by 4-5 pounds compared to the previous day. India's daily forecast rose by more than 2 rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market continues to be very active. Because everyone believes that it is difficult to transport foreign cotton to Shanghai, spot goods have been selling well in the market for several days. Also, there are very few shipments arriving daily. In mid-May, except for small amounts of Indian cotton, there are almost no American cotton shipments. Currently, because yarn prices are high, factories are still opening a batch of cotton yarn. Although they have also ordered foreign cotton, this raw cotton cannot arrive in time, so the factories are quite empty. In recent days, they have been buying spot goods in the market, so spot prices are more than 20 yuan higher than contract prices. The factory price converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 6 yuan is as follows:

20 Count American Mitlin: 292.50
20 Count Subgrade: 282.10
32 Count: 307.60
32 Count Subgrade: 296.80
42 Count: 310.95
42 Count Subgrade: 300.85

### Piece Goods - Eastern Piece Goods Firm and Expensive - Rebranded Eastern Goods Still Shipped to Inland Areas

Because the end of the month is approaching, money is tight in the cloth market. Merchants are focused on the turnover rate, and many are selling at reduced prices. Cheap, readily available goods kept appearing in the morning market, and the market was particularly sluggish with few transactions. In the afternoon, prices for Eastern piece goods steadily rose, and the business of traders and real customers became active. Selling prices also rebounded after the decline, mostly returning to the closing prices from the previous week. More than 100,000 pieces of grey cloth, bleached cloth, and poplin were sold from local brokers. More than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, and coarse cloth were sold by the Wen Yong brokers. The Yue Min brokers also sold several hundred pieces. Recently, it has been heard that rebranded Eastern piece goods, printed with domestic product labels, are still being shipped to inland areas in considerable quantities. This should also be guarded against.

The Eastern cloth market was stable in the morning. In the afternoon, sales of fine cloth by the North brokers and local traders were very strong, so selling prices gradually rose. As a result, the price of each piece of fine cloth rose by about 2 yuan, and the price of each yard of serge rose by about 7 cents. The current spot price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is 44.75 yuan, and the price for next month is 47.5 yuan. The current market price for the Four Gentlemen brand serge has risen to 1.385 yuan, with a firm trend.

Piece goods exports: 725 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 55 pieces were shipped to Haikou, and 54 pieces were shipped to Haiphong on the 22nd. 180 pieces were shipped to Yantai and 230 pieces were shipped to Tianjin on the 23rd.

### Serge Market Mixed - Weak and Strong Trends

The serge market trend is inconsistent, with strong and weak trends. White serge is in short supply in the market. British-made top-grade serge is selling for 30 yuan per yard. The Fengyu brand is asking 23 yuan. Non-Western goods double yellow edges are asking 16.25 yuan, second-grade is 13.5 yuan. Domestic Deda top-grade is 16 yuan, second-grade is 14 yuan. Yuanchang gray-brown plain thin serge has limited actual sales, and prices are also mediocre. However, domestically produced products from the local factory have abundant inventory, and prices are generally weak. Prices for yellow-green colors have improved. Dagongming Yinfeng brand is sold in batches at 10.05 yuan, and Dalong is at 9.6 yuan per yard. The average price of Zangqing gray-brown colors is about 0.25 yuan cheaper. Medium-thick serge, because the weather is hot now, and its price is expensive, Zangqing Huate ne and Hanlimeng are more popular, so there is not much rise or fall. The Yihe 55 number is still sold in batches at 19.5 yuan, and the 39 number is at 16.5 yuan. Yesterday, 55 boxes of wool were shipped to Haizhou.

### Grains - Rice Stays Level - Rumor of 100,000 Bags of Guest Xian Rice Arriving in Shanghai

The rice market is open for the first time after the holiday. Buying and selling directions have changed, and there is a feeling of being unable to hold on and having difficulty entering or exiting the market, so in the morning everyone adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Later, floating speculators and retail investors sought to sell off, and lacked a receiver for large amounts, so small amounts initially held at 43 yuan, but then the price went down all the way, only reaching 42.35 yuan, a drop of 0.5-0.7 yuan compared to the previous closing price of 43 yuan. After hovering for a long time, as various parties began to purchase, prices rose immediately. The prices of all goods were restored to their original levels, and the entire market ended with a flat situation.

The source of japonica and glutinous rice. The source of japonica rice has become scarce, with only five or six trucks from Suzhou and Tongxiang, totaling six to seven hundred bags. The glutinous rice transferred from Jiangyin is quite plentiful, no less than one thousand four to five hundred bags. The sales of japonica goods are still only in the off-site unofficial market, and it is heard that there is not much trade, with a depreciation of four to five cents. Wuxi held 46 yuan for japonica, and Changzhou white rice was 44-45 yuan. Other Suzhou Kun japonica in the central market ranged from 44-45 yuan to 43 yuan, Qing Si thin paddy rice ranged from 45 yuan to 43 yuan, and Nanhai early and late paddy ranged from 42-43 yuan. There are still customers hoarding glutinous rice, and the path to pastry shops and rice stalls is not weak, so although the goods are plentiful, there is not much impact. The selling price presents a stable and non-falling situation. If Liyang's Zhente Yuan is still 41 yuan, Special Grade is 40.05 yuan, 40 yuan, and other Dan Chang goods are mostly between 38-39 yuan, with only limited goods opening at 37.5 yuan. Yesterday, there was another rumor in the market that 100,000 bags of Jingwu and Jiangbei rice would arrive in port soon. It is not known whether this news is true or not. If it is true, then rice prices are likely to fall.

Imported rice is arriving in large quantities, but the overall situation is still weak. Although the merchants have set new non-cutting prices, intending to hold firm, but actual sales are sluggish, and non-professional speculators have shifted their attention to other commodities. Therefore, the holding situation was eventually broken by floating investors selling off their profits. However, the floating investors did not sell much. Spot rice only fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan in the morning, and continued to fall slightly in the afternoon. The lineup of long and short positions on the futures market is gradually shifting. Most of the shorts are original root firms, while the longs are northern gangs and big players. Both sides are evenly matched, and the market has entered a stable situation. However, about 20-30% still belong to general floating investors, so the August-September No. 2 Saigon early market stood at the original price of 54.5 yuan, but was depressed by the floating investors selling off their profits in the afternoon, with the closing price at 54.35 yuan, a slight drop of 0.15 yuan, and the immediate delivery price at 52.5 yuan. The immediate delivery price for No. 2 Siam was 52.2 yuan. 300 pieces of returning original packages were opened in the general market, and about 7,000 bags of spot goods.

Imported rice arriving in Shanghai. The Yihuo Steamship Company Mingsheng Wheel arrived in port from Hong Kong the day before yesterday (21st), carrying 7,951 bags of imported rice, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. The unloading onto the wharf began yesterday morning. Large amounts of imported rice and corn are being shipped north recently. Today, the Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing Wheel exported 700 bags of Shanghai-shipped imported rice and more than 6,000 bags of imported corn to Tianjin, and 2,000 bags of imported corn to Yantai.

### Coal - Charcoal Arrivals Increase - Prices Have Fallen

The charcoal market is sluggish. Selling prices vary greatly, because large quantities have been sold in the occupied areas such as Shenjiamen and Dinghai, resulting in too many retail investors, a lack of interest from buyers, and a chaotic market. It is estimated that the price of Wenzhou grade A charcoal is 8.3-8.4 yuan per dan, Haimen bamboo charcoal is 6.2 yuan, and Huangyan flat charcoal is 5.6-5.7 yuan per dan, a fall compared to last month.

### Oil Cake - Oil Market Falls Slightly

Yesterday, bean oil fell slightly compared to the end of last week. Bean oil continues to arrive, and sales are flat. Only the merchants are slightly active, so there is little development in the market. The Gang and Guizhou sesame oil also lost momentum. Yesterday, only 2,500 cans were purchased. The stance of Jiangbei Benfang bean oil is soft (the price is 170 yuan). Other Benjie traders sold 400 pieces of degummed Jiaozhou bean oil for 77 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao bean oil for 107 yuan, and 1,000 cans of Yantai bean oil for 100 yuan. Dalian oil was traded at 150 barrels for 106 yuan, Bengbu oil at 20 barrels for 102 yuan, Qingqi oil at 100 pieces for 75 yuan, Yanqi oil at 400 pieces for 76 yuan, Jiaozhou oil at 200 pieces for 74 yuan, and Dayou factory oil at 100 dan for 75.5 yuan. On the 22nd, 1,335 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea - Silk Market Rises

Yesterday's silk market: Yokohama spot goods 1,470 yuan, up 30 yuan; near-term 1,480 yuan, up 31 yuan; far-term 1,508 yuan, up 28 yuan. Market sentiment here has been invigorated. Except for white factory silk, Yihuo Xinfu Dachang bought 90 dan of Ji Li warp silk and 20 dan of Zhonggan silk. Selling prices fell nearly 10 yuan from before. The market atmosphere has not loosened, but US sales are still sluggish.

Yesterday, 500 bales of Husi were shipped to Europe, 24 pieces were shipped to Suez, 209 pieces of silk waste were shipped to Europe, and 40 boxes of artificial silk were shipped from Hong Kong.

### Tea Leaves: Strong Trade in Both Import and Export

In recent days, the source of raw tea leaves from inland areas has been quite abundant. Among those for domestic sales, there were over 800 packages of new Longjing and Qiqiang tea shipped from Wenzhou, and over 1200 packages of old stock. From Ningbo, over 2000 packages of raw tea leaves also arrived. Including the original stock on the market, the total is estimated to be no less than 20,000 packages. However, the sales to foreign firms remain sluggish. Yesterday, only Yongxing Baochang and other firms purchased over 80 boxes of Zhongzhuang Zhenmei tea, with prices ranging from 210 to 225 yuan, a drop of over 10 yuan in the market price.

We encourage each other to guide the youth and work together in our respective positions. Even if the pressure increases, we vow to persevere to the end.

Sincerely, the Shanghai Secondary School Guidance Research Association.

### Overview of Adult Education Year Implementation in Guizhou Province (1)

(Guilin Correspondence) Lei Binnan, Director of the Education Department of Guangxi Province, recently wrote an article entitled "Overview of Adult Education Year Implementation in Guangxi Province," detailing the implementation of adult education in the province. The full text is excerpted below:

(I) Introduction

The popularization of basic national education in this province began to be planned and implemented in 1933. In the process of implementation, adult education and children's education were carried out simultaneously, without any distinction. Since the implementation, schools have been widely established, and children's education has also been quite effective. However, adult education has not been able to achieve the planned goals due to the limitations of teachers and funding in the past. It is estimated that from 1934 to the end of 1938, a total of 1,550,425 illiterate people were eliminated, according to surveys, with an average of 380,000 illiterate people eliminated each year. There are still more than 2 million out-of-school adults in the province. If education continues at the previous pace, it will take more than five years to achieve universal education. At the second stage of the war, the demand for mobilizing the masses to participate in the war and national construction work is extremely urgent. Our supreme leader once pointed out to the people of the country the principle that politics is more important than military affairs. It is even more imperative to educate and train the masses without delay. In order to quickly complete the popularization of adult education and meet the needs of the war and national construction, it was determined that 1939 would be the Adult Education Year in this province. Human and financial resources were concentrated to thoroughly popularize adult education throughout the province within one year, in order to strengthen mass mobilization and bring into play the power of war resistance and national construction. This arduous task has been accomplished within the expected time limit as a result of the concerted efforts of the education community throughout the province and the enthusiastic participation of the masses throughout the province. However, due to the impact of the war in southern Guangxi, the data has not been collected and compiled, and a detailed report has not yet been made. At this time, only a brief outline of the implementation and the experience gained and the difficulties encountered in the implementation process can be provided for correction by domestic sages.

(II) Implementation Plan

The implementation of adult education is based on the "Implementation Plan for the Adult Education Year in Guangxi Province." The design process and content highlights of this plan are summarized as follows:

(1) Design Process: Between September and October 1938, this province had the motive to concentrate efforts to popularize adult education in 1939. In late December, the Provincial Government Committee decided that 1939 would be the Adult Education Year in this province. As a result, the large-scale popularization of adult education became a settled matter. The design was immediately started, and a symposium on adult education was held on January 4th and 5th, which decided to organize a drafting committee. Tong Runzhi, Yang Weiyu, Dong Weichuan, and Lin Wanli were hired as committee members, as well as the responsible personnel of the Education Department. Meetings were held five times before and after January 5th to 18th, and many small group meetings were held. By the end of January, the entire plan was completed, and it was approved by the Provincial Government Committee at the 195th meeting on February 4th and promulgated on the same day.

(2) Plan Content: This plan consists of 19 chapters and 64 articles, divided into purpose, goals, implementation principles, organization and equipment, enrollment and staffing, teachers, curriculum and teaching materials, teaching, guidance, graduation, continuing education, special ethnic education, inspection, assessment, funding, implementation procedures, summary, and appendices. In addition, there are six appendices regarding the organization of provincial and county promotion committees, teacher training, enrollment surveys, guidance goals, and examples of social activities. The plan stipulates that all out-of-school adults aged 18 to 45, and those who cannot read and understand the first two volumes of the textbook for civil schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education, must enroll in adult classes. All levels of basic national schools, county-run private secondary schools and above, and local cultural and industrial groups should set up adult classes, with at least 25 students and a maximum of 50 students per class (at least 15 students in mobile teaching classes). Classes should be divided by gender in principle, and a lottery compulsory enrollment method should be used, divided into periods for handling within one year. Each period lasts two months, and classes are held for two hours each day (no rest on Sundays), and the implementation process is stipulated to achieve the goal according to the schedule.

### Seven Educational Films Produced by the Ministry of Education

(Chongqing, 21st) The Ministry of Education is currently entrusting the Central Film Studio to produce educational films, including seven types such as (Charcoal Vehicle), (Vegetable Oil Vehicle), (Songpan Cotton), Children's Nursery, (Refugee Children), (Bristles), and (Grass Leaves). They are currently being produced and will be completed shortly.

### Provincial Nantong Middle School Headquarters Decided to be Located in Dongtai, Provincial Government Appoints Yao Baiyu as Principal

The headquarters of Jiangsu Provincial Putong Middle School is located in northern Jiangsu, as part of the provincial school relocation plan. Since the provincial government officially appointed Yao Baiyu as the principal, he immediately began active preparations. It is reported that the new school site has been determined to be in Dongliujiaoxie, and a spacious house belonging to a certain family has been rented as student dormitory. School equipment and everything are being arranged. In addition to selecting and hiring several teachers who have previously served in provincial schools and have rich knowledge and experience, the school's guiding principles will be based on the laws and regulations to implement resistance and construction education to meet the needs of youth in northern Jiangsu. It will enroll students in Shanghai in mid-July to allow students from northern Jiangsu to return home to study. The provincial Nantong Middle School currently located in Shanghai has been converted into a branch school.

### Hong Kong Education Authorities Actively Training Teachers, Normal School Expected to be Completed in Summer and Autumn

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong government has recently been actively improving education in Hong Kong. The promulgation of the new education ordinance is one of the steps. The strict limitation of teachers is also an important part of the plan. The purpose of this move by the Hong Kong government is to train teachers and standardize the educational level of Hong Kong with other British colonies. It is now found that the normal school under construction on Bonham Road is expected to be completed in the summer and autumn. The establishment of this school is purely for training teachers to supply schools throughout Hong Kong.

### Public Exhibition Cup Handball Second Round: Double Matches Tonight, Success or Failure Depends on the Efforts of China Youth Team

In the tenth Public Exhibition Cup handball, the China Youth team has already won the first round. In the ten singles matches of the second round last week, they were greatly threatened.

Otherwise, a third round must be held to decide the championship of this year. The order of doubles matches for tonight and tomorrow night is as follows:

### Track and Field Match: Mai Ling Overwhelms American Children, Result 62 to 33, Lun Bo Takes Three Championships

The first sound of track and field this year, the friendly match between Mai Ling and American Children, was held at the American Children's Sports Ground at 2:30 PM last Saturday. In the seven events, Mai Ling took four and American Children took three. In the half-mile relay, the American team was evenly matched and overwhelmed Mai Ling. Mai Ling dominated the field events. In the end, Mai Ling defeated American Children by a large margin of 62 to 33. Mai Ling's Lun Bo won three championships alone. His score of 10.2 seconds in the 100-meter dash equaled the record set by Edward at the Central and Western Group Games last year, which was the most outstanding. In addition, Mai Ling's Ross in the shot put, Kerrens in the high jump, and American Children's Baylor in the 880-yard race, with such results at the beginning of the season, are all commendable. The results of each event are recorded below:

Track Events: (100 yards) Lun Bo (Mai Ling) 10.2 seconds, (200 yards) Lun Bo (Mai Ling) 23.5 seconds, (440 yards) Lun Bo (Mai Ling) 55.8 seconds, (880 yards) Baylor (American Children) 2 minutes 10 seconds, (1 mile) Huale (American Children) 5 minutes 10.4 seconds, (120-yard low hurdles) Que Bo (Mai Ling) 15.8 seconds, (880-yard relay) American Children's Team, 39.4 seconds.

Xu Duo, Lu Zhongqiu, Liu Keren, Chen Linsheng, Hu Jiankun, etc. were present, chaired by Xu Duo and recorded by Hu Jiankun. Wang Yi and Ding Du were present as observers. First, Chen Linsheng reported on the status of various cup matches. Regarding the issue of male and female players of the Chinese team, the directors carefully considered and decided to use the qualifications and experience of those who recently won the championships of each group of the three Jingwu Cups as the standard. Lu Hanjun (captain), Zhang Ying, Ouyang Wei, Ji Zongpei, and Deng Xiurong were elected as official representatives, and Huang Zhijun was the alternate. In the women's group, Liang (captain), Lin (Hua Lian Woman), Huang Tongyin, and Zhang Yongru (Female Youth, etc.) were elected as representatives.

The uniforms of the entire Chinese team have been donated by China Table Tennis Company, which is commendable.

### Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Huang Zhijun and Li Zongpei Win the Ninth and Tenth Groups Championship

The third Spiritual Cup Individual Table Tennis Tournament was held in the afternoon the day before yesterday at 2:00 PM in the association's billiard room for the elimination rounds of the ninth group. Because it was a Sunday holiday, more than 300 people watched. Zhang Zhihong, the seeded player of this group and the fourth-place winner of the previous tournament, was highly regarded with his excellent offense and defense. However, he had been neglecting practice recently. In the first and second rounds of the rematch, he encountered strong resistance. Fortunately, he was careful and managed to turn defeat into victory and advance to the final week. Another Allied friend and strong player, Huang Zhijun, almost fell victim to the fierce attacks of Zhang Yuan in the rematch. Ultimately, relying on his rich experience, he defeated Zhang Yuan with a score of 11 to 9 in the final game and entered the final with Zhang Zhihong. Zhang appeared fatigued, choosing to hit the ball instead of defending, resulting in many wild shots. Huang took the opportunity to attack, putting on an excellent performance. He also had good luck, and although the scores of each game were close, Huang ultimately won the final victory. As a result, Huang Zhijun defeated Zhang Zhihong with a score of 3 to 0, winning the ninth group championship.

Huang Zhijun: 11-8, 11-9, 12-10 Zhang Zhihong

The final battle between Li Zongpei and Fang Yumin in the tenth group began at 7:00 PM in the evening. Li defeated two formidable opponents, Ye Maozhi and Zhong Xianfang, in the first two rounds, demonstrating extraordinary strength. Fang Yumin had suffered a crushing defeat to Li in the previous tournament and was eager to avenge himself this time, putting up an exceptionally fierce fight. However, he missed a sure-win opportunity in the first game, giving Li Zongpei the chance to come from behind. His morale inevitably declined, and he ultimately suffered a crushing defeat of 3 straight sets, allowing Li Zongpei to win the championship. Now, the champions of all ten groups in the Jingwu Cup have been determined. The organizing authorities plan to hold a round-robin tournament among the ten group champions to determine the overall championship.

Li Zongpei: 13-11, 11-9, 11-6 Fang Yumin

### Studies on Copper Production in Yunnan Province (Part 2)

Guanzi said, "The distance from east to west is 28,000 li, and from north to south is 26,000,000 li. Those that produce water are 8,000 li, and those that receive water are 8,000 li. There are 467 mountains that produce copper and 3,690 mountains that produce iron." The Biographies of Money-Makers says, "Copper and iron are found every thousand li, often with mountains producing them in a checkerboard pattern." Suoyin says, "It means like placing chess pieces, there is often one." The Treatise on Food and Money in the Book of Wei says, "Shangshu Cui Xian reported that there are copper mines in Hengnong Quntong Qinggu, with one dou yielding five liang and four zhu of copper. In the Qichigu mine, one dou yields eight liang of copper. Yanzhushan in Nanqingzhou and Shangshan in Qizhou are both old sites of copper officials." From this, we can infer that the amount of copper mined in Yunnan may vary, but the mountains and valleys are steep and deep, and the mineral deposits are likely similar to what is recorded in historical texts. However, all mining methods require pumping water. Gold is the mother of water, and wherever metals are produced, water accumulates. Therefore, copper mining always involves expenses for draining water, as is the case with silver mines. Between summer and autumn, there is a lot of water in the mine shafts, making drainage difficult, so operations are suspended to avoid damaging the mines. However, this is only the case before Western machinery was introduced to China. When looking for mines, one should first seek mountains with abundant shapes, solid geological veins, and lush vegetation, with mineral indicators visible. If there is indeed a reliable indication, then one should proceed according to regulations to avoid waste. In Yunnan Province, wherever there are mountains with mines, the surrounding hills must show mineral indicators. One should then search carefully. When a true indicator is found, the ore formation gradually becomes a patch, which the Yunnan people call "brushing the trough." From there, tunnels are dug. The wider ones are called "halls." From forming a trough to forming a hall, one finally has a prosperous mine. If soil and rocks are mixed together, it is called "loose wasteland." It is easy to lose money on labor if it is opened and then abandoned. In severe cases, the lower part may be opened, and the upper part may collapse, which could endanger lives. Not only will the assets be lost, but lawsuits will also arise. The Yunnan people call this "being covered," like a blanket covering one's head and face, so that one can no longer see the sun.

### An Artist of War

— Pinpin

Dr. Stoltzenberg is a modern European eccentric! Truly, from his appearance, Dr. Stoltzenberg is a distinguished scientist: tall, thin, kind, steady, with gentle blue eyes. Everything indicates that he is an old-fashioned scholar. This demeanor of his "tells that he has the spirit of a martyr for pure science: without hypocrisy, worn out by hard work and diligence. He once said, "People should not forget the great value of pure science and its inestimable benefits to all mankind."

He has a great laboratory in Hamburg, where he hopes to quietly study his "pure science."

His factory is filled with many workers, relying on marvelous machines, manufacturing poison gas under his command.

Once, due to careless manufacturing, his factory leaked poison gas, permeating most of Hamburg, poisoning thousands of people, and killing hundreds of workers. Afterwards, the doctor said, "The disaster is truly regrettable. No one can sympathize with the dead as much as I do - but this is an inevitable price we must pay for the research of pure science." The doctor is too enthusiastic about his "pure science." Therefore, in addition to the factory in Hamburg, the doctor has also secretly established countless similar factories in Madrid and other places.

In the last European war, the doctor supervised the production of a large number of poison gases to kill the Allied soldiers. He is a destroyer of culture; he makes women and children weep; he rapes science.

Dr. Stoltzenberg is addicted to war, and he has recently made many amazing inventions to make war more lovely and lovable.

He invented the "Butterfly" gas mask. According to the doctor's insight, people look very ugly wearing gas masks, which is detrimental to the beauty of women and very uncomfortable for children. Barbarians often tattoo their faces and bodies when going to war, but we are already civilized people, and aesthetic and hygiene concepts are most needed. Therefore, the doctor imitated the masks worn during festivals and made a type of "Butterfly gas mask." Soldiers wear it with majesty and beauty, women wear it like butterflies flitting among flowers, and children wear it softly and comfortably. The doctor is truly clever, he wants to turn cruel war into a happy festival. With this beautiful gas mask, people will not oppose gas warfare, and the doctor will become the top-tier rich man.

The second "contribution" to beautifying war is the doctor's "Rainbow Mist." He mixes various poison gases to form a "mist," because poison gases come in many colors, such as cyan, yellow, and green. If you add some other colors and mix them, wouldn't it be a "rainbow"? Under the "Rainbow Mist," hundreds of thousands of soldiers break out in cold sweats, their blood vessels rupture, their lungs rot, they go mad, and their flesh turns to pulp. This is beautiful enough, but Dr. Stoltzenberg is not yet fully satisfied with this invention. He hopes to make the "Rainbow Mist" have no odor at all (perhaps even make it fragrant and sweet), so that it meets the ideal of "pure science." - The sky is filled with colorful and fragrant "Rainbow Mist," and people die happily without realizing it. Dying like angels, Dr. Stoltzenberg is indeed an "artist" of war.

If we practice, wearing "Butterfly" gas masks, strolling under the "Rainbow Mist," wouldn't it be an excellent entertainment? The doctor created a new civilization - a civilization of death. Doctor, great scholar, he makes mankind love death, because he makes war into entertainment.

Does this represent human progress? Or regression?

Random Thoughts

### The Sacrifice

— Jinchuan

My grandmother sacrificed her life because she didn't go to school. It's not that she didn't have the opportunity to go to school, but this opportunity was sacrificed to "superstition." She often complained about her fate, recounting her experiences of not going to school. My maternal grandfather's family was very wealthy, and my grandmother was an only daughter, so my great-grandfather very much wanted to educate her and turn her into a useful woman. So he hired a teacher for her. This was truly a big deal in a remote village. The villagers were envious, so they sent their sons to attend school with rice offerings. There were usually about ten students. But in just half a year, there was a joke. My grandmother was very smart and quickly learned to read Tang poetry, while these many boys were still reciting the Three Character Classic. This caused an uproar in the entire village. They all said, "Women cannot study, women studying takes away the talent of men." So all the villagers gathered together to force my grandmother to drop out of school. The parents at the time were also helpless and had to dismiss the teacher and stop her from studying. This became a sacrifice to superstition, a regret for life!

Now this phenomenon will no longer exist, but I am writing this story to give the ladies on the isolated island who have the superior environment to study a comparison, so they can know the difficulty of women studying at that time, and now that they have books to read steadily, and skills to learn, they should work hard to strive to become a woman who contributes to society.

### Two Questions

— Aisi

In his address to youth, the modern French writer Andre Maurois answered two very important questions:

(1) What is the most valuable lesson that life teaches us?

(2) How can a young person maintain normality in difficulty?

In response to the first question, he said: "The purpose of the art of living is to eliminate the useless and painful experiences, and replace them with a pure and selfless appreciation of beauty." He further cited examples from facts, saying: "Escape from pain can be obtained from reading, music and other creative pleasures." Regarding human emotions, he said, "Stay away from those who hurt us, and then unpleasant memories will gradually fade." Finally, he said regarding the second lesson that life shows us: "Only a very few people are extremely bad. A young person who has always lived in a gently family life will be surprised by cruelty, selfishness, and suspicion when he first comes into contact with the outside world, and therefore think that everything he encounters must be this kind of bad phenomenon. In fact, his pessimism, thinking that mankind is very despicable, is not without basis. But when we know people a little more deeply, we will also feel that most people can be kind, can be gentle, and everyone has a heroic spirit. At this point, we begin to realize that what is hidden in the armor of sin is actually fear of life. The most common thing is that all ignorance stems from blind knowledge and action. The famous British essayist Charles Lamb once said, "I hate that person." At that time, an auditor objected and said, "But you don't know him deeply." Lamb said, "Of course, I have never known him deeply." "Do you think I would hate someone I know deeply?" Therefore, the most precious lesson that life gives us is sincere trust in human nature, regardless of the sins he commits after tomorrow, and regardless of his madness after tomorrow. Because all sins and madness are just a result, not a cause."

Regarding the second question, Maurois believes that our lives should be built on a solid foundation and should adhere to strict discipline. "If we can wholeheartedly abide by the discipline of religious life, the discipline of work, and the discipline of various games, they are pure and useful. In addition, we should seek unity of plan and perseverance in work. A young person is often tempted by various unlimited possible tasks. In fact, every young person should make choices. Although he likes to make various friends; likes endless travels; likes to pursue boundless knowledge; likes to engage in various careers; and experience every kind of love; but life must have limits; he must make choices, only in this way can he live deeply and richly."

### Meddling is Necessary

— Qiu

A child sees a wild boy bullying a group of ducklings on the road and strikes up to "fight for justice." As a result, he gets a face full of mud thrown at him by the wild boy. When he gets home, his father grabs his ear and scolds him, "Who told you to meddle!"

A primary school student can't bear to see his friend suffer a severe punishment from the teacher, so he begs the teacher to forgive him. But the teacher glares at him and says, "Don't you meddle!"

Everyone has been educated since childhood with "don't meddle in other people's business" and has studied the "maxim" of "each sweeps the snow from his own door, and does not care about the frost on another's roof." When they grow up, they imitate the behavior of the "sages" who "cultivate themselves alone." The upper class pretends to be "gentlemen" and "elders." The lower class also feels that they are "not ashamed before heaven, nor ashamed before men," that they are "good citizens."

Therefore: The "toss-top-hats" on rickshaws, the "pocket-touchers" on streetcars, bystanders only treat them as a "performance" and absolutely no one helps to catch the "pickpocket." The ruffians in the alley "extort money," bystanders only treat it as a debate, and no one is willing to say a "fair word." When the police on the road are chasing thieves, bystanders only hide under the telephone poles and will never step forward to help catch them. In short, the minds of every bystander are flooded with a huge wave of "don't meddle in other people's business": This huge wave has overturned the small boat of "acting bravely for a just cause"!

Therefore, there are only people in society who help "evil" grow; and no one supports "justice." That "evil" is growing vigorously like spring bamboo shoots, unstoppable; and "justice" is gradually withering like autumn grass, "unable to revive"!

Indeed, if you meddle in other people's business and fight for justice, it will provoke the hatred of the "evil-doers" who will unite to attack you; but why are there only groups of "evil-doers" in society, and no groups of "righteous people"?

Meddle in other people's business! Meddle in other people's business! I hope that all the "righteous people" will unite to meddle in other people's business! Don't stand idly by and watch the growth of "evil" and let "justice" perish!

### The Color-Changing Fish

— Hui

Most fish can adapt to the surrounding environment and change their body color. Blind fish have gray-white bodies and can never change again. Fish that are blind in one eye also have gray-white on the side of the body opposite the blind eye, while the blind side can still change with the environment. This is due to the effects of endocrine and nerve function.

### Being a Son of God (Part 2)

Jesus never said that our life is a long and sweet song, he understood that life is a beehive full of hardships. According to him, religion is not to remove these hardships for good people, but to give people the power to bravely face hardships and become victors through struggle. Religion may not give you satisfaction, but it can give you power. Religion does not give you protection from danger, but it can give you the courage to face danger without fear. What Jesus taught and what he practiced permanently is that religion always has a power that is sufficient for the brave. It not only helps people overcome all adversity but also guides people to make moral progress and achieve spiritual victory. In today's difficulties in all aspects, in our personal experience, and in the competition of world affairs, isn't this the time for us to give Jesus' test a suitable opportunity? I wholeheartedly believe that religion can meet our needs and can cultivate a kind of personality that gives meaning and purpose to this chaotic world. "He gave them the power to become sons of God," as the author of the Gospel of John recorded, this sentence implies that there are still great areas of human experience that have not been reached. If people dare to do this, they will not harm each other, hate each other, but will make themselves and help others to be good sons of the heavenly Father. We urgently need to address this question today: "What are you becoming?" or rather, "What do you want to be?" In the famous work of Rhodes, there is this passage: "After twenty or twenty-five years, when you meet a person in the road that you knew when you were young, sometimes it will shock you very much. You remember seeing him when he was young, his face was beautiful, his attitude was charming, different from others. Now? Haggard, thin, because he neglected physical exercise when he was young. In addition, what has become of his thoughts? There was also a person whom you admired in the past, you can almost say that he was the driving force for you to work hard. Whenever you came into contact with him, you were passionate, your thoughts were alert, and you were determined to work hard to read more, think more, and do more meaningful things. There was an internal force driving you forward. You knew that you couldn't catch up with him, but because of him, you certainly made greater progress. After many years, you meet him and can't help but ask yourself, "What has become of his sharp mind and courageous spirit?" Why does he seem so ordinary? What he thinks and says is the same as others? His attitude and words show that he has given up the struggle to build himself into a more excellent, more real, and more great personality.

### Shirley Temple's Success Story - Today is Her Eleventh Birthday -

— Xinying

Time flies so fast, Shirley Temple is already eleven years old. She was born on April 23, 1929; therefore, today is her eleventh birthday. Here, I will write some about Shirley Temple's success story:

Eight Years of Film Life Since she stepped onto the screen at the age of three, Shirley Temple's film life has been a full eight years by this year, when she is eleven years old. During these eight years, she has indeed earned a lot of money. When she first started on the screen, she only earned $250 per week, but it soon increased to a price of $75,000 for each film she made. Since she was five years old, she has been enjoying good luck, and her popularity has continued to this day, leaving an impression on movie fans in every corner of the world.

A Virtuous Mother Shirley Temple is innocent and lively on the screen. Such acting skills are of course due to her artistic talent. But in addition to talent, we also have to give credit to her mother's proper upbringing. Mrs. Temple pays attention to everything for this money-making daughter and loves her. Whether it is in physical or artistic aspects, she does not allow her to suffer setbacks. Under a virtuous mother and proper upbringing, Shirley Temple can also go straight to the road to success.

Special Treatment by the Company For Shirley Temple, Fox Film Company has also earned a lot of money. The main point is that the films starring Shirley Temple have low costs and high box office. For this reason, this little star is also treated specially. She does not film at night, and filming does not exceed the time stipulated in the contract. Not only is Shirley Temple's salary so high, but even her mother also receives a weekly salary of $150.

No Substitute Found Shirley Temple is now eleven years old, and her childhood has passed in an instant. Whether she will continue to make films on the screen in the future has become a question. Some say that she will leave the screen, and others say that she will continue to make films. But in any case, she has been declining recently, and the films she has made have not been as popular as in previous years, which is certain. Therefore, her fate in the future cannot be said for sure. Hollywood is constantly discovering child stars, but a second Shirley Temple, this substitute has not yet been found. It can be seen that it is not an easy thing for a child star to achieve the same success as Shirley Temple!

### Recent Events in Film City

— Degang

Sonja Henie Becomes a US Citizen The Hollywood skating star Sonja Henie, originally from Norway, recently decided to become a US citizen. According to Miss Sonja herself, the reason for this is that she will never have to be afraid of the Germans again. But according to people who are familiar with Miss Sonja, she became a US citizen to avoid the US government's various taxes on foreign film actors. This reason may be correct, because Miss Sonja is a very thrifty girl!

Movie Stars Peddling Cigars At the Coco Club in Hollywood, a grand dance party was recently held, hosted by Korda, and all the proceeds were used to benefit British and French charities. Countless famous movie stars, such as Myrna Loy, Olivia de Havilland, Annabella, Merle Oberon, Diana Lynn, etc., wore waitress outfits and peddled cigars to the dancers, priced at $25 per box. In an instant, they were all sold out.

Shirley Temple to Retire After filming one more film, child star Shirley Temple will leave the film industry and return to the life of an ordinary girl, because her golden age has passed. After Shirley leaves, the only remaining child star is Kim Hye-soo. Miss Kim is known for her naughtiness and activity, unlike Shirley who is known for her innocence. I wonder if the audience can accept Miss Kim ascending the child star throne left by Shirley?

### Drama Trends

Li Lihua, the female lead in "The Heroic Lovers," is a new talent whom Art China values highly. Li comes from the theater, specializing in Qingyi roles, and her appearance is extremely beautiful. Her father is the once-famous Xiaosheng (young male role) Li Guifang. Li Lihua's performance on the silver screen is quite brilliant. Art China claims to have found another Yuan Meiyun, which shows her position in Art China.

The critical circle unanimously believes that Cao E, a promising newcomer, played the role of Hongzhu, Zhang Wenyuan's lover, in "Cherishing the Beauty in the Boudoir." Her charming expressions are very wonderful. However, Cao E has a strange habit of liking to cry; women can't escape this flaw.

Zhang Cuihong is becoming more and more beautiful. Recently, she has been filming "Guanyin" day and night. Although the work is hard, her spirit is very full. Dressed in the attire of a Bhikkhuni (nun), she appears extraordinarily simple and lovely. It is said that Zhang Cuihong will take a short break after "Guanyin" is finished.

Art China will plan another great work, taking the story of Cao Cao forcing the palace in Xiaoyaojin from a novel as the theme, which has considerable significance. It is said that the film will be titled "The Empress Fu's Vengeance."
