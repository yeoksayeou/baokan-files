### Over 160 Japanese Planes Bombard Outskirts of Occupied City Again Yesterday; Rain of Bombs Causes Most Brutal Air Raid; Circle for Five Hours Before Being Repelled by Chinese Air Force

Chongqing: After being routed yesterday, Japanese planes regrouped and attacked the occupied city again this morning with over 160 aircraft. Approaching the vicinity of the temporary capital around 9:00 AM, they hesitated to advance upon seeing the Chinese Air Force waiting in full battle array. They circled over the suburbs for as long as five hours. Finally, around 1:00 PM, some Japanese planes bombed the outskirts, attacking defenseless civilians. A unit of the Chinese Air Force bravely engaged them. Some Japanese planes took the opportunity to break into the city airspace, but were met with a pincer attack from the Chinese iron bird units both inside and outside the city. Simultaneously, the Chinese ground air defense units bombarded them fiercely. The Japanese planes then fled eastward. (Dispatch of the 27th)

Chongqing: A hundred Japanese planes staged a large-scale attack on Chongqing today, indiscriminately bombing areas within a fifteen-mile radius of the city. Although the Chinese side continuously fired dense anti-aircraft artillery at the Japanese planes, the Japanese still dropped heavy bombs as if it were raining. As a result, over five hundred Chinese people were bombed to death. The Japanese planes not only bombed the Chongqing area extensively, but also flew to many other cities in Sichuan Province and dropped countless bombs. Today's air raid was even more brutal than yesterday's. Since the tragic bombing of last May, this was perhaps the most cruel air raid. From noon to 2:00 PM, Japanese planes bombed the outskirts of Chongqing for two hours, repeatedly dropping various sizes of bombs on the areas where refugees and residents lived outside Chongqing City. Many houses were engulfed in flames, creating a horrific scene. However, during this intense bombing, no foreigners were reported injured, and foreign properties also escaped damage. Currently, officials from Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are assisting Chinese officials in investigating the disaster situation in the bombed areas near Chongqing. A town on the Jialing River suffered the most damage and the highest number of deaths. A school for the orphans of fallen soldiers located there was also destroyed. Doctors and other assistants at the American Methodist Church hospital were extremely busy caring for the injured and maimed people. Seriously injured Chinese people were sent to the relief station run by the American Methodist Church outside Chongqing City for emergency treatment. According to the church, the number of deaths and injuries was at least five hundred. Today, the air raid alert in Chongqing City lasted from 9:30 AM to 3:10 PM, a total of five hours and forty minutes. Thousands of people living in special air-raid shelters heard the continuous sound of bombs exploding and anti-aircraft guns firing. (Reuter's dispatch of the 27th)

Chongqing: Between 9:20 AM and 3:00 PM this morning, Japanese planes attacked Sichuan Province in six waves, but only two waves bombed Chongqing. It is reported that this batch of Japanese planes dropped bombs in the western suburbs, far from the city, and the sound of the explosions was barely audible. According to Chinese sources, when Japanese planes bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing yesterday, two Japanese planes were shot down. One crashed 25 miles away, and the other fell on the border between Sichuan and Hubei. It is reported that 136 Japanese planes participated in yesterday's air raid. (Reuter's dispatch of the 27th)

Chongqing: Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing on the afternoon of the 26th. The printing houses of three newspapers, including the Central Daily News, were damaged. The National Daily News and the New Sichuan Daily were also affected. However, it is expected that the three newspapers will resume publication soon. Rumors that the British ambassador's residence was bombed are unfounded. After the air raid, the ambassador personally informed the Reuters reporter by telephone that all buildings of the embassy were intact and that he was safe. The German Embassy, which is very close to the bombed area, was also shaken. (Reuter's dispatch of the 26th)

Chongqing: Several Chinese newspapers, whose printing presses, editorial departments, and business departments were affected during the Japanese bombing, continue to publish today, demonstrating their extraordinary spirit of enterprise. It is especially commendable that the Central Daily News continues to publish despite the damage to its printing house. The editorial offices of the National Daily News and the New Sichuan Daily were also damaged yesterday. Estimates of the number of casualties from yesterday's attack vary. The official Chinese figure is 120 killed and wounded, while foreigners estimate a total of about 300 killed and wounded. (Reuter's dispatch of the 27th)

Chongqing: It is now known that during recent Japanese attacks on Chongqing, twenty bombs hit Fudan University (same school as Fudan Middle School). Several school buildings, including dormitories, were destroyed. Hundreds of residents nearby were killed or injured. It is not yet known whether any students were killed or injured. A printing house near the school was also destroyed, killing twenty workers. In addition, several bombs hit a densely populated village nearby, causing hundreds of casualties. The total number has not yet been confirmed. (Reuter's dispatch of the 27th)

### Japanese Troops Near Zao Yang Surrounded Separately by Chinese Army; Japanese Troops Attempt to Break Through Repeatedly Without Success; Chinese Side Gains Significant Battle Results

Fancheng: Over three thousand Japanese troops who fled southwest of Zao Yang on the 25th were overtaken by Chinese pursuing troops near Fangjiaji. Unable to resist, they retreated towards Paishan to the southwest, where they were met with a head-on attack by Chinese intercepting troops, resulting in the death of over a thousand Japanese soldiers. On the same day, another group that continued to flee from Zao Yang retreated south through Yushan and was also intercepted by Chinese troops between Jiaji and Lijiaji (both southwest of Zao Yang) and surrounded. They repeatedly attempted to break through that day, but were unsuccessful. In addition, the Chinese army has been intercepting retreating Japanese troops on the Xianghua Road for several days, gaining significant battle results. A unit of Japanese reinforcements rushed south of Zao Yang on the 25th, but was also blocked by the Chinese army in the mountainous area around Wanshanling (southeast of Zao Yang) and has not been able to contact the besieged Japanese troops. The Chinese army is tightening the encirclement of the besieged Japanese troops, numbering about ten thousand, forcing them into the areas near Shuanghe Town and Zao Yang and launching an encirclement attack. (Dispatch of the 27th)

Luoyang: After the remnant Japanese troops in the border area between Southern Henan and Northern Hubei were repeatedly defeated by the Chinese army, Chinese pursuing troops continued to advance towards the suburbs of Zao Yang. On the afternoon of the 24th, they surrounded and attacked about a thousand Japanese troops near Yangjia, forcing them into the area north of the Gunhe River. At the same time, elite Chinese troops advanced rapidly towards Zao Yang from east of Cangtai Town. On the afternoon of the 24th, they encountered over two thousand Japanese troops near Qizhuang Weishan (southwest of Huyang Town) and immediately launched a fierce battle. By night, another unit of the Chinese army charged into the rear of the Japanese forces, killing over eight hundred Japanese soldiers. (Dispatch of the 26th)

### Chinese Troops on Xinhe Road Force Their Way to Outskirts of Xinhui City; Japanese Reinforcements from Jiangmen Intercepted by Chinese Troops; Account of the Recapture of LiangKou Fenghuo Ling

Sihui: On the morning of the 24th, Chinese troops on the Xinhe Road attacked towards Xinhui City, once forcing their way close to the outskirts of the city. They engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese all day, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. By night, Japanese troops from Jiangmen and other places rushed to reinforce them, but were intercepted by the Chinese army, resulting in the death of over two hundred Japanese soldiers by the morning of the 25th. (Dispatch of the 27th)

Wengyuan: In the battle to recapture Fenghuo Ridge (southwest of LiangKou) on the 25th, the Japanese regimental commander Jiro Yamamoto was killed on the spot, and two Japanese officers, Matsumoto Araki and Matsuko Yoshika, were captured (two were company commanders, one was a lieutenant). (Dispatch of the 27th)

Wengyuan: Since the 14th, the Japanese troops invading the northeastern area of Conghua have been reinforced by six to seven thousand troops, plus about a thousand cavalry and artillery units. In order to implement their strategic plan, the Chinese army completed a new deployment with agile movements, luring the Japanese troops deep into the expected mountainous area and launching a typical encirclement and annihilation battle. One unit advanced into areas such as Jilonggang Fozishi Hengpailing (northeast of Conghua), destroying highways and cutting off the Japanese army's rear lines of communication, leaving the Japanese isolated and without reinforcements. Another powerful mobile unit advanced rapidly in multiple directions, attacking from the east and west in areas such as Feitianfeng Ding, Gaoshadi Ding, Fenghuo Ridge Jiekou, cutting the Japanese troops into two sections. At the same time, the main force of the Chinese army pressed south, heavily surrounding the Japanese troops, placing them in a desperate situation. On the morning of the 25th, the Chinese troops advancing south successively occupied important high grounds such as LiangKou North and LiangKou West. The fierce fighting continued until night. A unit of Japanese troops advanced north from Conghua Jiekou to reinforce them, but the Chinese army, in order to concentrate their forces for annihilation, did not block them, but lured the Japanese troops into the Chinese pocket-shaped position and surrounded them. The Japanese troops in LiangKou, after the arrival of reinforcements, desperately defended the positions north of LiangKou, hoping to cover the retreat of their remnants to the south. The Chinese army, aware of the Japanese plan, again consumed their strength in the mountainous area northwest of LiangKou. By the dawn of the 26th, the Japanese were exhausted. The Chinese army once again launched a fierce pincer attack from the north and south, engaging in intense bayonet fighting. By noon, the Japanese position was shaken due to heavy casualties. At 2:00 PM, the Chinese army took advantage of the situation to recapture LiangKou and Fenghuo Ridge, an important stronghold to the south. At this moment, a unit of the Chinese army pursued from the north, while another unit blocked from the southwest. In this battle, over three thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, including the regimental commander Jiro Yamamoto. Two company commanders, Araki Matsumoto and Matsuko Yoshika, were captured, along with several dozen soldiers. In addition, a large number of guns, documents, and spoils of war were seized. This is the largest victory since the Great Victory in Northern Guangdong. (Dispatch of the 27th)

### Chinese Troops in Northern Henan Fiercely Attack Loulou; Japanese Reinforcements Ambushed

Luoyang: Chinese troops in Northern Henan have been fiercely attacking the Japanese troops in Loulou (west of Tangyin) for days, killing many of them. On the afternoon of the 24th, five trucks of Japanese soldiers drove west from Tangyin to reinforce them, but were ambushed by Chinese soldiers near Gengsi (near Loulou East). All the Japanese soldiers were annihilated, the trucks were blown up, and over ten light machine guns were captured. (Dispatch of the 27th)

Luoyang: On the morning of the 25th, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese troops in Qinyang with swift action, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese after half a day of fierce fighting. A Japanese lieutenant squad leader was captured alive and has now been escorted to a safe location and given preferential treatment. (Dispatch of the 27th)

### Chinese Troops Achieve Great Victory in Southern Anhui; Tongling Now Under Control; Over Two Thousand Japanese Killed

Shangrao: On the 23rd, the Qingyang Chinese troops in Southern Anhui launched a surprise attack in multiple directions with lightning speed. One unit advanced north from Muzhen and had advanced to the southeast of Tongling by the 24th. Tongling is now under Chinese control. Another unit destroyed the Japanese position at Damaoling and continued to advance towards Guichi City to the northwest. Another route recaptured Hengqiao, north of Qingyang. The Chinese army's attack caught the Japanese by surprise, causing them to panic and lose their combat effectiveness. Over two thousand Japanese soldiers have been killed in the past two days, marking a major victory in Southern Anhui. (Dispatch of the 27th)

### The Consistent Style of Italy and Japan

The tense situation in the European war and the land which is falling victim to war, has become a virtual hell on earth. The countries standing inside the circle, no matter their successes or defeats, have met with the dire misfortune of those who do battle for dominance. Other countries outside the circle are all quivering with fear at this raging conflagration. Others are rolling up their sleeves, feigning to prepare themselves for the whirlpool, intending to reap the fisherman's profit. Originally before the European war, Germany and Italy had formed an axis and Japan clung to it. After the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the Anti-Comintern Pact became invalid and they lost their common foundation for a time. However, their desire to change territory and their means of invading the weak were the same, and the objects they wanted to attack were the same. Therefore, there was often a considerable response between them. Since the Second European War, we have seen a very obvious and formulaic posture in these two countries: whenever the international situation becomes tense, they also stir up trouble. What should be distinguished is that Germany and Italy do maintain a close relationship, but Japan has long been abandoned by Germany. Therefore, rather than saying that there is any relationship between Germany and Japan, it is better to say that Japan unilaterally uses Germany. For example, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Shiro Torau, advocated economic aid to Germany, believing that there was no need to fear democratic countries and that a strong policy should be adopted towards them. Here, everyone knows that what Shiro Torau calls economic aid to Germany is a facade. Japan's weak economy makes it difficult to solve its own crisis. Assisting Germany is even more of a delusion. Japan's expression of this is not really out of love for Germany. It is merely taking advantage of the victory of Germany's operations on the Western Front to signal Britain and France in an attempt to achieve its blackmailing plot, hoping that Britain and France will sacrifice some of their interests in the Far East. As for Italy, its desire lies in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. The Italian People's Daily, which represents the Italian Foreign Ministry, once said that Italy considers the Danube River basin and the Balkans to be the key to Italian security, and also said, "Although Italy is very eager for peace, if a war breaks out in the Balkans, Italy will never be able to stand aside." There are too many such frank expressions to list. In March, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki issued a joint statement recognizing that "there is a completely harmonious relationship between Italy and Germany, Germany and Hungary, and Italy and Hungary. The two countries firmly advocate, especially in the current situation, adjusting their actions to maintain peace in the Danube and Balkan regions." This can illustrate that Italy has achieved partial success in the Balkans through diplomatic means. What it hopes for now is to strike Britain and France in the Mediterranean. Mussolini called the Mediterranean "our sea", but the two main ports on this sea, Gibraltar and the Suez Canal, are both in the hands of Britain and France. Therefore, Italy's desire to develop towards Africa and the Near East is hindered by Britain and France. This is the fundamental contradiction between Italy and Britain and France, and it is the fundamental reason why Italy is now waving its flag and shouting.

Then, will Italy join the German side and immediately go to war with Britain and France? His claim that "the opportunity for war is imminent" and "preparation for war" have all been widely known, but there has been no action to date. The reason for this is that, diplomatically, it may have been influenced by the considerable concern expressed by the United States; militarily, the German army has taken advantage, but has not reached the point of decisive victory, and the British and French navies still maintain overwhelming authority in the Mediterranean; at the same time, it is also due to Italy's own economic weakness. From 1935 to last year, his tax revenue was insufficient, totaling 5.6 trillion lire. The burden of taxes was transferred to the farmers. The farmers shouted, "There is nothing to eat." The lack of coal and kerosene has also become a fatal wound to his military industry. Last year alone, it was necessary to import 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion tons of coal. Italy occupied Albania and planned to obtain 37% of its kerosene needs from that country. As a result, Albania was only able to supply 7%. The plan to replace kerosene with alcohol was also declared a failure due to the lack of coal. Iron, an equally important war resource, is also in short supply. Italy wanted to import a large amount of iron from Spain, but the result was not as hoped. The fact that these main war resources are in a state of great shortage makes Italy unable to avoid worry. Perhaps the reason why there has been no action to date lies in this! "War", "war" is constantly being said, but in the final analysis, the true intention is still to wait for an opportunity, hoping to reap the fisherman's profit without any sacrifice. Taking advantage of Germany's power to blackmail countries in the war to fulfill their wishes is the same for both Italy and Japan. The decline of human civilization and the failure of justice and fairness to become international norms have trapped Japan in difficulties from which it cannot extricate itself. It is by no means the world's sympathy and justice for China, but the blood and iron in China's resistance. By extension, the future of the European situation will also depend on blood and iron as the final decider. Italy's hesitation lies in estimating Germany and Britain and France, as well as its own blood and iron!

### U.S. Army Strength Enhanced; Major Exercises to be Held This Week; Roosevelt's Speech Dispels Fear and Fantasy; Isolationist Policies Will Invite Future Attacks

New York – Last night, President Roosevelt delivered a speech urging the people to consider national defense measures. Simultaneously, the U.S. Army is preparing to hold large-scale exercises in Louisiana this week.  With new uniforms, new organization, new combat methods, and new equipment, about one-third of the U.S. Army will engage in the annual spring maneuvers held across the United States. President Roosevelt inspected the exercises of the U.S. Army's Fourth Corps in Georgia in late April. It is widely believed that Mr. Roosevelt's statement last night, "Our country's naval and land forces today are the most powerful military institutions in world history," was partly inspired by the exercises he witnessed in Georgia.  The uniforms currently worn by the U.S. regular army have undergone significant changes. The short trousers worn by the U.S. expeditionary forces during the last European war have been replaced with long trousers secured with leggings. The exercise procedures have also been modernized, abandoning the previous four-column or infantry maneuvers. The new exercise method uses twelve infantry squads formed in a column, with each squad separated by an arm's length. The previous division system of 15,000 men has also been changed to 8,500 men in peacetime and 12,000 men in wartime. Five infantry divisions and one cavalry division have been fully motorized, and half of the remaining cavalry divisions have also been mechanized. It is stipulated that 25,000 of the 70,000 troops participating in the exercises will be equipped with the new semi-automatic M1 Garand rifle. This rifle can fire 25 rounds per minute, while the rifles currently used by most of the regular army can only fire 10 rounds per minute. The exercises will also involve large-scale testing of new mortars, field guns, and new anti-aircraft guns. The Army Air Corps has also been reorganized and possesses high-speed aircraft capable of flying 400 miles per hour. With the recent surge in production at American factories, 17,000 aircraft can be produced annually, with the potential to produce 50,000. It seems not difficult for the U.S. Army to acquire 10,000 aircraft.  As a result of the major reorganization proposed by U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, the peacetime strength of the regular army has increased to 227,000, and can be increased to 1 million within a week of mobilization. This future large-scale army exercise

is comparable in scale to naval exercises in the Pacific. U.S. Army officers have already foreseen that the "Blue" U.S. Army will defend Louisiana against attacks from the "Red" army from the west, and believe that these exercises will enable the forces to cooperate effectively. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Asserting the Uselessness of Isolationism

Washington – Last night, President Roosevelt delivered a radio address, saying that the United States was shocked by the almost unbelievable suffering currently being experienced by the civilians of Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France. President Roosevelt earnestly called on the people of the country to generously contribute to the Red Cross for the sake of our shared humanity. He continued by discussing the issue of American defense, forcefully stating the uselessness and impossibility of isolationism for the countries of the Americas. He said that if such a concept were to be the foundation of national defense policy, it would only invite future attacks. The past two weeks have shattered many isolationist illusions; they no longer imagine that the United States is remote and isolated, immune from the dangers unavoidable elsewhere. Some, after awakening, have even become nearly panic-stricken, saying that we have no defense. Still others whisper that only by abandoning our liberalism and way of life can we create an adequate defense and match the strength of the aggressors. He has no such illusions, nor does he have such fears. Although we are now more focused on reality than before, we should not merely cry out about impending disaster and doubt our strength. We should eliminate this fear and fantasy. President Roosevelt also mentioned the recent discussion about the lack of American preparedness, saying that today's American naval and land forces are the largest, best-equipped, and best-trained military organizations in American history. World events may change, necessitating the need for the United States to reassess its naval and land forces programs at any time. He firmly believes that if such a situation arises, Congress and the President will work together harmoniously, as they do today. He will not hesitate to request additional funding whenever necessary. The United States has requested assistance from domestic manufacturers for all military materials. The government is now prepared to allocate funds for expanding factories, establishing new factories, and hiring thousands of new workers, because in light of the constantly changing international situation, it would be unfair to hope that manufacturers would undertake the above matters if future orders were to be suspended.

Strictly Dealing with Spies and Traitors

When President Roosevelt discussed the dangers of the "Fifth Column," he said that spies, saboteurs, and traitors must be dealt with strictly. New forces are constantly using meticulously planned propaganda to disperse and weaken our strength in times of danger, as they have done in other countries. These forces are extremely harmful and must be stopped from spreading to the New World, as they have done in the Old World. At this time, the entire world, including the American hemisphere, is threatened by destructive forces. The people of the Americas are determined to build their armed defenses to the extent necessary in the future and will do so quickly. Our defense and the creation of a way of life are not only for the Americas but for all humanity. We have a supreme responsibility and a great task. He prays day and night that the world in which we live will see peace again. He knows that the people of the country all feel the same way. God will surely heal the wounds inflicted on the human soul.

Strong Naval, Land, and Air Forces

President Roosevelt continued, saying that the U.S. government spent $1,487,000,000 more on the navy between 1933 and 1940 than it did in the seven years before 1933. The total number of naval combat personnel has increased from 79,000 to 140,050. In 1933, the U.S. Navy had 1,127 usable aircraft; today, it has a total of 2,892 aircraft, either owned or on order. Today's navy is far stronger than at any time of peace in our country's history. In terms of attacking power and efficiency, it can be definitively said to have exceeded the era of the last World War. In 1933, the army had 122,000 soldiers; today, the number has actually doubled. The government allocated $1,292,000,000 more to the army between 1931 and 1940 than it did in the previous seven years. By the end of 1940, every unit of the current regular army will be fully equipped with the most modern weapons. In 1933, the United States had 355 anti-aircraft guns; today, the number of modern anti-aircraft guns owned or on order exceeds 1,700. The entire army had only 24 modern infantry mortars in 1933; today, the number owned or on order exceeds 1,600. The number of modern tanks in 1933 was only 48; today, the number owned or on order exceeds 1,700. The number of army airplane pilots in 1933 was 1,263; today, only the army has more than 3,200 of the world's best aviators. Hundreds of highly skilled aviation personnel in the National Guard and reserves are not even included.

Stepping up Production to Meet Emergency Needs

Last year, the aircraft industry's ability to produce military aircraft increased significantly, but this capacity is still insufficient. The government is now cooperating with the industry and has decided to increase its production capacity to meet needs, so that it can produce 50,000 aircraft annually.

President Roosevelt newly stated that many patriotic people with expertise and ability have come to Washington to assist the government with their training, experience, and talent. Our purpose is not only to accelerate production but also to increase the overall convenience of the country, so that it can continue to expand to meet future emergency needs. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### U.S. May Ban Raw Material Exports to Japan Due to National Defense Needs; Japan Asks U.S. to Exert Authority Over the Philippines; Expand Quota for Japanese Immigration to the Philippines

Washington – The U.S.'s national defense needs may cut off the war materials shipped to Japan, including scrap metal. Members of Congress have agreed to amend the military defense bill to authorize the cutting off of military equipment, machinery, and munitions shipped to Japan. It is believed that this amendment will be passed by the Senate. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Washington – The Japanese government has called on the U.S. government to use its influence to persuade the Philippine government to expand the quota for Japanese immigrants to the Philippines. Political observers are now paying close attention to the outcome of this move. According to the Japanese government, in recent years, an average of about 2,800 Japanese immigrants have entered the Philippines annually. The legislation currently under consideration in Manila would limit immigration from each country to 500 people per year. The Japanese government is making this appeal because the U.S. President has the authority to veto any Philippine law regarding immigration. The Washington Post, which favors independence, said that this move puts Roosevelt in a dilemma. Relations between the U.S. and Japan have generally been poor, and some are strongly advocating against any measures that would further strain relations. However, if the U.S. President were to prevent the Philippine government from implementing its immigration laws, it would inevitably cause displeasure among the Filipinos. The United States has long set an example in immigration policy, and the Philippine government has the right to implement its own immigration policies based on this example. The current Philippine plan does not discriminate against any country, while U.S. law does indeed favor some countries over others. What the Japanese ambassador said, that the Japanese have contributed to the economic development of the Philippine Islands, is true. However, in light of the events in Manchuria and Norway, it is understandable that the Philippine government has doubts about whether the Japanese contribution will be respected in the future. The newspaper continued that while the U.S. flag and the U.S. fleet protect the Philippine Islands, the possibility of conspiracy by Japanese residents is perhaps not deeply concerning. But after 1946, the large and ever-increasing number of Japanese residents in the Philippines will be a clear danger. The general opinion here is that the U.S. will no longer be concerned with Philippine affairs in six years. If Manila legislators limit immigration to the Philippines from all countries to preserve the Philippines for the Filipinos, the U.S. government should hardly oppose it. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Allied Forces Hold Northern Positions; Intense Fighting in Flanders; German Attacks on Mennan Repelled; French Army Abandons Valenciennes Position

Paris – An official communiqué was just released stating that yesterday, Allied forces were engaged in intense fighting with enemy forces on the eastern front of Mennan (north of Lille). The enemy suffered heavy losses, and some elite units were completely annihilated. Our forces in Valenciennes have retreated to a position behind the Escaut River last night. There were no other significant battles in other positions. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Paris – An official announcement was made this afternoon stating that as of 9:00 AM this morning, the Port of Calais in northern France is still in the hands of our forces. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

London – This morning, Belgian military communiqués broadcasted on Paris radio announced that the Belgian army continues to perform well, though they have fought many desperate battles and are in a difficult situation. Located on the left flank of the Allied forces, the army has achieved localized victories from place to place, such as yesterday’s capture of 500 enemy soldiers. Our air force is currently launching attacks which have been quite successful, having shot down 255 enemy aircraft since the beginning of the war. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Paris – A military spokesperson stated that on Saturday and Sunday, the German army launched extremely violent attacks on Allied forces in Belgium. Artillery, aircraft, and tanks all participated in the fighting. Those advancing towards Arras fought back and forth, but Allied forces ultimately held their original positions. The German army also launched two attacks on a six-to-ten-mile frontline, both of which completely failed. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Paris – Headquarters just released a battle report stating, “The enemy recently concentrated a large number of troops and armaments in the Boulogne area and launched a major offensive yesterday. After intense street fighting, the city has fallen. The situation on the northern front remains extremely intense, as does the situation along the Somme River. Our forces continue to make progress in that river basin. Between the Aisne and Meuse Rivers, our artillery and machine gun teams inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, as even enemy prisoners have admitted. We witnessed several enemy infantry units being mowed down by machine guns. In addition, enemy aircraft flew to our airfields to bomb, and our fighter planes and anti-aircraft teams immediately inflicted heavy damage on and dispersed the enemy aircraft.” (Havas dispatch, 26th)

London – Responsible parties here just confirmed that the French Port of Calais is still defended by Allied forces. British troops are operating. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Paris – Although the authorities remain silent regarding the Allied forces’ situation in the Flanders region, this morning's newspapers all believed that the Allied forces’ recovery there seems increasingly evident. For example, General Duval wrote in the Paris Daily that the initial momentum of the German advance seemed to be coming to an end, and that the French, British, and Belgian armies were now defending in an orderly and determined manner. The paper also quoted a dispatch from Soulek that German propaganda agencies were now stating that the Nazi armies were still far from victory in this war, and that the articles in German newspapers over the past few days have not been as boastful of victory as before. Even the German commander-in-chief suddenly realized that the war had many difficulties. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

London – A British military headquarters communiqué stated that there were no serious attacks on the British front yesterday. The Belgian army to the left of the British army was under heavy German attack, and the British army has assisted in the battle. Towns and cities in the rear areas were heavily bombed. The developments over the past few days have not diminished the courage or supplies of British soldiers. One British tank destroyed seven enemy armored vehicles on its own. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Paris – As the German army has begun to launch offensives in the Flanders region over the past two or three days, military figures here have commented on them, calling them an attack on a "graveyard" and believing that the enemy's general staff is adopting the same strategies used by the German general staff during the last European War

The German General Staff used strategies to launch an offensive in the Flanders region.

in the Battle of Verdun, that is, concentrating manpower and resources to make a desperate attempt at any cost. In essence, it is an attempt to use a real "human wave" to "submerge" the opponent's positions. Moreover, the main targets of the German offensive this time are the city of Mennan on the east bank of the Lys River (north of Lille) and the city of Kortrijk. However, as of this morning, despite the German army's full-force attack and heavy losses, its gains in terms of positions have been minimal, with no significant progress. At the same time, the German army also attacked the city of Valenciennes. After strong resistance and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, the French army retreated to a new defensive line last night, according to orders from headquarters, as the position there was already too exposed in terms of the overall situation and could not be held for long. As for the western front, after occupying the port of Boulogne, the German army is advancing towards the Port of Calais. The German radio station issued a message yesterday afternoon stating that Calais had fallen, which has been denied by French military figures. In addition, on the Somme River, the French army continues to clear out the remaining enemy forces, and has recovered several bridges and communication points on the north bank. In the upper Argonne region, the German army launched a large-scale offensive three days ago. After a strong French counter-offensive, several lost territories have been recovered, and the enemy left behind many corpses. In short, judging from the enemy's combat situation, its military authorities seem to disregard the deaths and injuries of soldiers. We often see enemy soldiers advancing bravely under artillery fire and even in the barrage of automatic rifles, resulting in thousands of deaths each time. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Allied Forces Resisting German Offensives; German Army Suffering Heavy Losses

Paris – Last night, French military sources said that the situation on the Artois front and the English Channel yesterday had improved compared to before. The gap between Bapaume and Beronne on the Artois front was still open but not closed yesterday. However, the corridor through which the German army reached the English Channel was under heavy Allied artillery fire. At the same time, the situation around the English Channel was slightly more favorable to the Allied forces. The mechanized units commanded by German General Reichenau were once again firmly blocked by the Allied forces in the Saint-Omer and Arras areas. Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand flew to inspect the northern front of France yesterday and returned here last night, expressing great satisfaction with the morale and combat capabilities of the Allied northern forces. The Allied forces there repelled three German attacks on Sunday and two more yesterday. The Allied northern forces refused to give up an inch of territory in southwestern Belgium. Allied artillery and air forces inflicted serious losses on German General Reichenau's mechanized units. The German losses in the past forty-eight hours were heavier than on any day of the past seventeen days. The heavy losses of the German army can confirm Hitler's order to the German General Staff, "Attack without regard to sacrifice." General Reichenau originally planned to launch a "lightning attack" behind the Allied lines, but yesterday moved north outside Arras, trying to flank the right wing of the Allied forces in the north. French officers said that this was the German army's renewed attempt to encircle the British, Belgian, and French troops north of the gap, to prevent the Allied forces there from communicating with the Allied forces in the central front along the Somme and Ancre rivers. Although the German army had a slight advantage over the Allied northern forces, the German army's five attacks over the past two days were repelled. The Allied northern forces continued to fight, receiving a large supply of food and munitions from the sea. News from the Balkans stated that 70,000 German wounded soldiers had arrived in Austria from the northern front, and that schools there had been hastily converted into hospitals to accommodate the wounded soldiers. The German army suffered considerable material losses. In the past four days, the German army lost 70 to 80 first-line aircraft every day. Statistics showed that the British Royal Air Force shot down about 40 German aircraft every day, and the French Air Force shot down even more German aircraft. In addition, the Belgian, Polish, Czech, and Dutch air forces also attacked German aircraft. In the past two days, Czech aircraft alone have shot down 11 German aircraft. French military analysts stated last night that Hitler had deployed 110 German divisions from the North Sea to the Swiss border, and that there were five German armies in Flanders and the Netherlands. The total German force consisted of 200 divisions, half of which were very weak because the soldiers were overage and poorly trained. French officers said that the German divisions had the same shortcoming, namely, a lack of fully trained officers, no commissioned officers, and poorly skilled artillery. The German artillery suffered the most during the period when the Allied powers forbade Germany from possessing a standing army. During the period of expansion, German artillery expanded its peacetime organization into a wartime organization by a ratio of 20 to 1. As a result, the German artillery did not receive adequate training. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Germany Declares Occupation of Calais, Preparing for a Major Assault on Britain

Swiss Capital - The Supreme Headquarters of the German Army recently released a war report stating that German forces have already occupied the French port of Calais and are advancing victoriously towards Gravelines (between the ports of Calais and Dunkirk). (Havas News Agency, 26th)

Berlin - The German High Command announced last night that after a fierce battle with British, French, Dutch, and Belgian forces, the German army has occupied the strategically important French port of Calais, located 24 miles from Britain. At the same time, the High Command warned Britain that German aircraft are now ready to launch a massive assault on the British Isles "like waves". It is reported that after the German army occupied the main French ports on the English Channel, they cut off the retreat route of one million Allied soldiers in northwestern France. According to German military officials, this move has made it impossible for the Allied expeditionary forces to withdraw to Britain. Semi-official German sources claim that in addition to occupying Calais, German forces also control Lens and Béthune. This report indicates that the northern German forces are also advancing on Calais to complete the encirclement of the isolated Allied forces. (Associated Press, 27th)

German Headquarters - The German High Command issued a war report this afternoon stating that our forces are advancing in the provinces of Flanders and Artois, narrowing the encirclement. North of Menen, our forces have broken through enemy lines in that area and have pushed towards Ypres. (Note: Menen and Ypres are located northwest of Lille.) French colonial troops northeast of Lens attempted to counterattack, engaging our forces in a bloody battle, suffering heavy losses and retreating. After our forces occupied Calais, the French front line in that area has been cut off. Our air force continues to bomb ports along the English Channel, preventing the enemy from attempting to evacuate troops surrounded by our forces. The Dunkirk port pier was hit and caught fire. There is no important military news on the southern front. In the recent battles south of Sedan, the enemy had five tanks destroyed by our forces. Our air force flew to the vicinity of Paris and Reims, bombing transportation lines and troop columns. An enemy airfield with dozens of aircraft had twenty aircraft destroyed by our planes. Yesterday, the British and French lost a total of seventy-three aircraft, while our army lost fifteen aircraft. In the Narvik area, our army has dispatched paratroopers to reinforce. An enemy aircraft carrier was anchored near Harstad and was sunk by our planes. Another large warship, two cruisers, and a transport ship were hit and caught fire. Many aircraft parked at the Bardufoss airfield were destroyed. Last night, enemy aircraft invaded our western territory and bombed non-military targets, but there were no major losses. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

Berlin - German radio reported on the conquest of the French town of Lillers, claiming that two French battalions were defending the town. The German army attacked with one battalion, and after a fierce battle, the German army invaded the city from the north and northeast at 8:30 PM. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

French Forces Attack the Siegfried Line; Sound of Artillery Heard Near Basel

Basel - Allied forces, in order to ease the pressure of the German army on the ports of the English Channel, plan to launch an offensive against Germany's "Siegfried Line." Last night, French heavy artillery, located at Volgelsheim, four English miles from here, bombarded the Stein area of the "Siegfried Line." The sound of artillery could be heard here. The German village of Efringen-Kirchen suffered material damage, and the German troops there have withdrawn. The French artillery also bombarded the German railway hubs of Baden and Müllheim. (Associated Press, 27th)

Swiss Capital - The Telegraph Agency has just issued a message stating that at 3:30 AM today, the sound of artillery was heard near Basel, lasting for quite some time with short pauses in between. It is believed that the French artillery first heavily bombarded German positions, and the German army retaliated with heavy artillery. Soon after, thick smoke rose from a town in the French province of Upper Alsace, presumably hit and on fire. In addition, at 3:00 PM, French artillery in Upper Alsace again opened fire on German railways, villages, and towns north of this city, lasting for a long time. (Havas News Agency, 26th)

### General Ironside Transferred, Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Home Forces; General Dill Succeeds as Chief of Staff; General Kirke to Retire

London - General Ironside has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces. The position of Chief of Staff he vacated has been filled by Deputy Chief of Staff General Dill. The current Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces, General Kirke, is about to retire. According to well-informed sources in London, due to the development of the war situation, the defense against possible German invasion of Britain must be entrusted to someone with strong and resolute methods. Therefore, this transfer has taken place. It is said that the appointments of Ironside and Dill demonstrate the British government's great emphasis on strengthening Britain's domestic defenses by any means within its power. According to well-informed sources, the issue of domestic defense is now extremely important, and Ironside's new position can only be entrusted to a military person with strategic capabilities and experience. Britain has not been invaded by enemies for centuries, so this type of defense must be placed on a completely new foundation. However, Ironside's appointment is by no means due to criticism of General Kirke's approach to his duties. Furthermore, according to Reuters, this adjustment by the British High Command is completely different from the army adjustments announced on Saturday night. There were no "dismissals" in the Central High Command. However, the extreme seriousness of the overall war situation and the rapid increase in the German threat to the Channel ports have made it necessary to immediately step up action on the British home front. (Reuters, 27th)

London - The Admiralty has appointed Powell as a senior member of the department and Chief of Staff of the Naval Air Arm. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

London - The new Chief of the General Staff, General Dill, has a long military career, having served as commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, Director of Operations at the War Office, and commander of the garrison in Palestine. He received decorations from Britain, France, and Belgium during the South African War and the previous European War. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

London - Newspapers here are satisfied with the appointment of General Ironside as Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces and emphatically state that this shows the British government attaches great importance to domestic defense. Regarding the news that fifteen French generals have been dismissed, some newspapers recall that Marshal Joffre took similar measures when the Battle of the Marne was about to take place during World War I. The unanimous response of British workers to the government's call to accelerate war industry has also attracted the attention of British newspapers today. The Daily Telegraph reported that the government's appointment of General Ironside is an acknowledgment of the new problems that the war has brought to the country by affecting the Channel coast. He must now be given greater powers to extend to the army and air force. The Times stated that home defense is a simple problem in nature and must be related to both the army and the air force. The most urgent necessity is the close cooperation of the two armies. The Times also warned the public not to claim that Germany is now exerting all its strength in the war. (Reuters, 27th)

### Mussolini Inspects Italian Youth Corps; Italian Army Receives Action Warning; Government Orders Stockpiling of Wool and Cotton

Rome - The atmosphere of war in Italy became tense again yesterday, as one million Italian soldiers received a warning in Italy that the "time is near" for action in the Mediterranean. This warning was issued during a broadcast by Ansaldo, the editor of "L'Impero" newspaper, who is considered the mouthpiece of Foreign Minister Ciano. Also, Gada, the editor of "Il Giornale d'Italia" newspaper, another mouthpiece of the Foreign Minister, boasted in the newspaper that even if Italy stays out of the European war, it will restrain the Allies from concentrating 1.2 million troops on the Italian border. Recently, Prime Minister Mussolini inspected 25,000 members of the Fascist Youth Corps and Blackshirt Corps. The members of these two groups, all between the ages of six and eighteen, raised short swords and shouted "War! War! War!" as they marched past the review stand. The Japanese envoy was also standing to the right of Mussolini on the review stand. Before the inspection, the Prime Minister talked with the leaders of Italian arms factories about the program for certain new types of artillery. He then met with senior generals to discuss details of the Italian war machine. Recently, it was announced here that the use of all coal-powered vehicles will be prohibited after June 1. Also, an order was issued last night that all raw materials for plush supplies must be registered with the government within fifteen days. Yesterday, Italian newspapers again promoted the idea that France is mistreating Italians throughout Tunisia. Note that Tunisia is one of Italy's demands to the Allies. (Associated Press, 27th)

Rome - Yesterday, Prime Minister Mussolini, accompanied by Undersecretary of War Soddu and Chief of the General Staff General Graziani, received General Rossi, General Cussoni, and the head of the anti-aircraft artillery, General Pariani. He also met with the directors of Italy's two largest arms factories, Ansaldo and Terni, and gave instructions on plans for the rapid and complete equipment of the artillery. The Prime Minister also met with the Minister of Public Works, Celina, to discuss the issue of self-sufficiency and decided to develop a power plant project that can generate 25,000,000,000 kilowatt-hours per year, which would save 16,000,000 tons of foreign coal. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

Rome - The Italian government has ordered all warehouses and depots to stockpile wool and cotton. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

Rome - All newspapers in Rome yesterday carried the order issued by Crown Prince Umberto, the Italian military supervisor, on the national day, stating that the entire nation should be determined to avoid all dangers as long as it is beneficial to the country. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

Turin - After holding a sports meeting, all students in Turin, in front of the Crown Prince, swore an oath as follows: "I will fight for the future of the Italian people, fight for the freedom of the motherland at sea, fight for the victory of Italy, and fight to obey the orders of the Leader." Germany sent representatives to participate in the student games. When the German representatives departed, Italian students and civilians gathered in front of the train station, cheering for the friendship between Germany and Italy. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

### Italy Proposes Suggestions on Contraband Control; British Representative Satisfied; Detailed Rules Being Drafted in Rome

London - The Ministry of Economic Warfare has just announced that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, who recently went to Rome to attend the meeting of the Anglo-Italian Joint Standing Committee to discuss the control of contraband, is scheduled to return to London last night. Leith-Ross believes that the Italian authorities' proposals regarding the control of contraband can be a very satisfactory basis for a compromise between the two sides. British and Italian representatives have been working in Rome to draft detailed rules. (Reuters, 27th)

### Turkish Martial Law Now in Effect; Britain and France Emphasize Cooperation with Turkey

Istanbul - Turkish martial law came into effect on the 25th after being promulgated by the government gazette. The law stipulates three circumstances for declaring martial law: (1) implementation of mobilization, (2) disturbances within the country, and (3) feeling a military threat. The key point of the law is to immediately transfer all civil powers to the military authorities. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

Turkish Capital - The Ottoman press is paying close attention to the situation in the French theatre of war and the anti-British and French demonstrations in Italy. The semi-official Ulus newspaper stated that if Italy enters the war, the U.S. government will implement neutrality laws against Italy, and Italy will be unable to obtain various raw materials needed. Therefore, it is doubtful whether Italy will rashly embark on the path of entering the war. A spokesman for the Turkish intelligence agency said that Germany had indicated that the appointment of General Weygand of France as commander-in-chief of the Allied forces was an expression of indifference towards Turkey by Britain and France. In fact, this is clear proof that these countries attach importance to cooperation with Turkey. (Havas News Agency, 26th)

### British Air Ministry Announces Front-Line Air Combat Situation; Aircraft Heavily Deployed Over Calais; British Aircraft Attack German Airfields

London - The Air Ministry announced that from 5:30 AM to 9:30 AM yesterday morning, British Air Force squadrons shot down at least twenty enemy bombers and fighters and damaged twenty others. The British side lost only five aircraft. Air battles were constant over the French coast between Calais and Dunkirk. According to pilots' reports, the air there was full of aircraft. On Saturday night, British heavy bombers continued to launch attacks on enemy forces. Targets in the Rhineland bombed by British aircraft included railway junctions, branch lines, and troop assembly areas. Many important targets on enemy transportation lines were also bombed. A munitions depot was hit, exploded, and caught fire. Two British bombers were lost. Medium bombers flying from southern England and France again attacked enemy armored vehicles, munitions, and artillery overnight, with considerable success. Four British aircraft are missing. Due to weather conditions on Saturday, fighter activity was less frequent, but twenty enemy aircraft were shot down. Four British fighters were lost. On Sunday, enemy aircraft destroyed or damaged totaled forty, and seven British fighters are missing. The four British fighters that were reported missing on Thursday have now safely returned to their French airfields. British Coastal Command reconnaissance planes flew to Rotterdam yesterday morning and saw that the oil tanks there were still burning after being bombed recently. They took the opportunity to drop bombs on other oil tanks, causing them to catch fire. According to a report from the Air Ministry's intelligence office, British aircraft launched a major attack on Friday night, bombing troop trains and important railway junctions in northwestern Germany and the German-occupied areas with considerable success. British aircraft also attacked the Fluggen airfield at midnight. The hangar suffered heavy damage and caught fire from incendiary bombs. It was still burning two hours later. Bridges on the canal connecting the River Lys and the Rhine were also bombed at low altitude by British aircraft, suffering heavy damage. Another British plane heavily bombed Nordhorn, a few miles from the German border, destroying troop trains and munitions trains. Ten machine guns on top of the troop train opened fire to resist. According to a bomber crew member, "We passed through a network of blue tracer bullets and dropped our bombs in unison. The explosions were deafening, and we saw fragments of freight cars flying everywhere, and their wreckage immediately caught fire. The whole area was ablaze." A motorized column of thirty vehicles was attacked ten miles from Düren and completely dispersed. The railway junctions at Jemappes, Libramont, and Rocourt were also attacked. Munitions and gasoline storage facilities in Rocourt were hit and exploded. A train near Namur was hit and half destroyed. Several other military convoys were also bombed and strafed. The railway junction in Leuven was hit and caught fire. The Saint-Ghislain railway junction was also heavily bombed. British aircraft also attacked troop assembly areas and airfields within Germany. The pilot who bombed an airfield northeast of Dortmund reported that on his return trip, he saw a fire in the Ruhr, indicating that other British aircraft had hit their target. On Saturday, British aircraft launched continuous attacks in a wide area. Bombers attacked pontoon bridges and roads in the Belgian front-line area and dropped 200 bombs on a long line of enemy supply trucks near Poperinge, then dove to a height of ninety feet to scatter small bombs. The main road bridge over the River Lys was destroyed, and one pontoon bridge was destroyed, while the rest suffered military damage, and the roads leading to the pontoon bridge were blocked. That evening, British aircraft flew into Belgian territory and heavily bombed a large number of German troops gathered behind the front lines. (Reuters, 27th)

London - The Air Ministry announced that British Royal Air Force heavy bombers bombed enemy transportation lines all night and attacked enemy-occupied airfields and the Poperinge area and Belgian territory. No aircraft were lost in these operations. (Reuters, 27th)

Cologne - According to the "West German Observer," enemy aircraft bombed southern Cologne on the night of the 25th, dropping four bombs that all landed in the Rhine. A British aircraft was hit by German anti-aircraft fire, and the pilot jumped out using a parachute and was immediately captured. The other personnel on board perished with the aircraft. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

London - Reuters has learned that well-informed sources are laughing at the German communiqué claiming that German aircraft bombed British airfields. It is likely that what the Germans are referring to is the attack on Suffolk and East Anglia. The Air Ministry has released a detailed statement that, apart from what has already been reported, there has been no other damage. (Reuters, 27th)

### British Warships Lost; Sinking of Aircraft Carrier Denied by London

### Germany to Intensify Attacks on British Convoys; Warning to Neutral Responsible Personnel

Berlin - German officials yesterday again warned neutral countries not to participate in British convoys. According to a reporter from Haitong News Agency, Germany will intensify its commercial war against Britain in the near future. The German warning stated that Germany has repeatedly warned neutral countries not to participate in enemy convoys, but neutral ships continue to participate. This action is an act of non-neutrality and will encounter all the dangers of war. Furthermore, British warships are unable to protect ships participating in convoys and scatter and flee whenever they encounter submarines. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)

### Balloon Barrage Deployed Over London

London - As a result of German aircraft attacks on the southeastern corner of Britain this week, Britain has stepped up its efforts to cope with the threat of German aircraft invasion. Britain's most reliable air defense equipment, the balloon barrage, has been densely deployed in the skies, and all air defense preparations have been strengthened. The exact number of these British air defense balloons is a military secret, and no one knows for sure, but there are probably at least several thousand. Sometimes only a few of these balloons are raised in the air, while at other times they are scattered like stars in the sky, too numerous to count. The number of balloons raised varies according to the situation. (Associated Press, 27th)

### Allied Forces in Northern Norway Advancing

Paris - The Norwegian embassy has just released a war report from the military authorities in northern Norway stating that British, French, and Norwegian troops in the Ofotfjord area have advanced to the Niingsvatnet River and the Hankkivaara River. There is nothing worth mentioning about the situation in southern Helgeland. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

Swiss Capital - The Neue Zürcher Zeitung of Zürich has just published a dispatch from a reporter stationed in the Swedish capital stating that Germany is now preparing to use Norway as a base to launch a large-scale attack on Britain. Those originally stationed in central and southern Norway have concentrated in the ports of Bergen and Stavanger. Many German cargo ships are quickly unloading cargo in Swedish ports and then sailing away, probably heading to various ports in western Norway to prepare to transport troops.

### Pravda Comments on German Military Tactics

Moscow - Pravda commented on the European war situation, saying, "Examining the war situation over the past two weeks, our judgment of the first battle between the Allied forces and Germany proves that the Anglo-French group is not as prepared in this war as Germany. The smooth development of the German offensive is due to the use of new tactics, such as tanks, low-flying bombers, motorized convoys, and new types of soldiers (airborne parachute troops). At the same time, the German air force is superior to the Allied forces in both quantity and quality, which is why the German air force is dominant. The German command is using the experience they gained in Poland and the West to continue their strategy of cutting off the main enemy forces, with the obvious intention of defeating the enemy forces one by one. Although the Anglo-French group has dragged the Netherlands and Belgium into the war, they have not given them sufficient military assistance. As a result, the Dutch army, seeing the futility of resistance, surrendered to Germany within five days. The Belgian army is also currently retreating, and they have not received significant assistance." (TASS, 27th)

### Japan Organizes Core Cabinet; First Meeting Today

### Curbing "Fifth Column" Activities: French Concession Intensifies Precautions. German Residents with Neutrality Can Stay As Usual. Special Protection for Public Utilities

Mr. Aurenty, the French Consul General in Shanghai, told reporters yesterday that the French authorities in the city are already working to curb the activities of the German "Fifth Column" within the French Concession, but whether any emergency measures will be taken is yet to be decided. Mr. Aurenty denied that the French Concession authorities will adopt a "release-prisoners-on-parole system" for Germans (including Jewish refugees). He stated that "since the outbreak of the European war, we have not changed our attitude towards German residents. All residents will still be allowed to live in peace and enjoy their work."

Inciting All Parties to Oppose Jewish People

When Jewish refugees were asked about the rumors, they said that these rumors are being spread by the Nazi organizations in the city. They implicitly indicated that the so-called news that another 3,000 Jewish refugees were coming to Shanghai, although already denied by the Municipal Council, originated from the "Fifth Column." It is said that the German side clearly wants to incite antipathy towards Jewish people among both Chinese and foreigners in the city, so that Jewish people will face the same situation as they encounter in Germany. Recently, amid the Municipal Council's staff reduction, rumors have spread that a large number of employees were being laid off and replaced by Jewish people, which is one of the German propaganda efforts.

German Residents' Situation Not Painful

Furthermore, according to foreigners who have resided in the city for a long time, the treatment of German residents is currently very different from what they received during the last European war. When the last European war broke out, all German residents in the French Concession were ordered to move elsewhere. Some families could not find a place to live and wandered the streets, in extremely dire circumstances. Foreigners who have lived in Shanghai for a long time can still recall the concentration camps set up for German residents during the last European war, although it was a long time ago and they cannot accurately remember the location and the number of German residents imprisoned. Since the outbreak of the European war last year, only five German residents in the French Concession have been expelled. In addition, three German tourists in a Belgian business apartment received warnings and were ordered to leave.

Intensified Precautions in the French Concession

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, an information spokesperson for the French Embassy stated this morning (the 27th) that although the French Concession authorities have not issued orders affecting German residents within the concession, they have intensified precautions within the concession. Rumors that many German residents residing in the French Concession have recently been ordered to leave the country are indeed inaccurate.

Outrageous Elements Are Being Expelled

It was found that in late April, five German residents were expelled for not complying with the orders issued in the French Concession to the four hundred German households at the time of the European war outbreak, and maintained their "neutral residency". It is heard that afterwards, only one German was ordered by the authorities to leave the French Concession at the end of this month for applauding when the screen showed Hitler and expressing contempt when the screen showed King George of England while watching the film "The Lion Has Wings" at the Cathay Theater earlier this month.

Recruiting British and American Police Officers for Assistance

According to the French Embassy spokesperson, the French authorities are not afraid of destructive activities occurring within the concession, because since the outbreak in Europe, they have been constantly taking precautions. Precautions have recently been strengthened, and special protection measures have been taken at power stations, fire brigades, hospitals, and waterworks, with personnel guarding them day and night. At the same time, the special patrol section of the French Police Department has recruited British and American police officers to assist regular patrols. It is also heard that all personnel of the French Municipal Council are now working on a "wartime" basis, with their working hours many times longer than usual. This is due to the lack of staff caused by employees enlisting in the army.

### American Parcels Can Be Sent to Chinese Occupied Areas

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, the National Government previously prohibited about 300 types of contraband from being imported from overseas or through the mail. The American Post Office then ordered that parcels containing such contraband intended for the occupied areas would not be accepted. Earlier this month, American merchants in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai protested to the American Consulate in Shanghai, stating that this action by the American Post Office has seriously affected American merchants, as most American merchants in China use parcel post. This protest was supported by the American Chamber of Commerce. The American Consulate then reported the information to the American State Department. According to inquiries made to the American Consulate this morning (the 27th), the American Post Office has amended this prohibition, and especially parcels sent to the occupied areas of China. However, in case of accidents, the sender will be responsible.

### Various Gatherings Suspended on May Thirtieth Commemoration Day

As the May Thirtieth Commemoration Day is approaching, the police authorities of the two concessions, in addition to taking necessary strict precautions on that day, have now notified various groups, associations, and societies that all gatherings are prohibited during this period of precautions. Therefore, some organizations that were planning to hold gatherings on that day have now postponed them.

Concessions Take Routine Precautions

According to the *Shanghai Times*, the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession will take routine precautionary measures on Thursday this week, which is the fifteenth anniversary of the May Thirtieth Massacre, in order to maintain public order. Because the current situation in Shanghai is special, there will be no commemorative ceremonies. The precautions taken by the authorities will be lifted at midnight on that day.

### Tobacco and Currency Exchange Businesses Start Applying to Exchange Aluminum Coins. Strict Investigation Required Before Approving the Amount

Since the Ministry of Finance entrusted the Bank Association and the British-owned HSBC Bank to issue new aluminum coins, various banks and money shops have been applying to exchange them in succession, so as to circulate them in the financial market as soon as possible, and then gradually allow industrial and commercial enterprises to exchange and use them separately. A reporter from the Daguan News Agency learned from both the tobacco and currency exchange industries yesterday that the new one-cent and five-cent aluminum coins have been issued to the fourth batch. However, there is little circulation in the various industry markets. The exchange authority has now approved applications for exchange from the members of the tobacco and currency exchange industries. The exchange procedures are: (1) Each exchange shop and tobacco shop must first submit a letter applying for the amount to be exchanged; (2) The exchange authority will send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation of the actual business needs; (3) Based on the investigation report, the amount of exchange applied for will be approved. The strict implementation of the above three measures can thoroughly prevent manipulation and hoarding. Various tobacco shops and exchange shops have followed the above measures and submitted letters requesting exchange in order to meet the needs of business transactions and making change.

### Japanese and Puppet Troops Disturb Fengqiao Without Succeeding, the Ning-Shao Area is Safe

According to a Ningbo telegram received by the shipping industry, Japanese troops from Xiaoshan, accompanied by puppet troops numbering four or five hundred, suddenly left the city yesterday and attempted to disturb Fengqiao. The Huajun was on strict alert, and the Japanese and puppet troops did not dare to advance and retreated back into the city to defend it. Currently, the Ningbo-Shaoxing area is extremely safe, with only occasional Japanese aircraft disturbances.

### Merchants Disregard Price Control Laws, Given Final Warning. Twenty-One Street Vendors Penalized Separately. The French Concession Has Penalized Over One Hundred Yuan. Strict Inspections to Begin in June

In order to facilitate public purchasing and improve market conditions, the Municipal Council had previously stipulated measures for stores to clearly mark prices and ordered compliance. It is now learned that many street vendors and retail stores have been prosecuted by the Municipal Council for delaying to post price tags, as a warning. The Council also reiterated its previous order, strictly requiring all stores selling essential daily necessities to comply with the provisions of Council Notice No. 5233 before June 1st, and implement the method of affixing price tags and posting price lists. If there are any further violations, once detected, they will be prosecuted according to law.

Twenty-One Street Vendors

Yesterday morning, the Public Concession police department filed complaints against twenty-one street vendors in the West Bazaar, Chengdu Road Bazaar, and Yulin Road Bazaar who failed to comply with the order to mark prices, with the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao-Yi stated that the Municipal Council's policy of suppressing prices was being implemented to eliminate the evils of speculation, manipulation, and hoarding, and strict sanctions would be imposed. Marking prices is also part of the price stabilization policy. The defendants have not complied with the clear instructions, and should be given appropriate punishment in accordance with Article 33, Item 1 of the Violation Penalty Law, and requested the court to impose punishment according to law. After questioning by Judge Shen Shanzeng, it was decided that the defendants had limited knowledge and were first-time offenders, so leniency was granted, and each was fined eight yuan, as a slight warning. If they dare to re-offend, they will be severely prosecuted without leniency.

Weights and Measures Cases

From May 4 to May 26, 1940, the French Concession Police Department inspected the weights and measures used by stores within the concession, totaling 109 cases. Among them, 23 violated the regulations and were fined from 20 to 250 yuan. Among them, five were for using false scales, four were for using short English feet of two or three *sheng*, and about five were for using counterfeit weights and measures. In addition, the Police Department is strictly inspecting the marking of prices for daily necessities as stipulated in Order No. 158 of the French Consul General's Office of April 12, 1940. Eighty-one stores were fined from 5 to 10 yuan for violating the order.

Final Warning from the Price Control Committee: A public announcement is hereby issued. It has been found that there have been 81 cases of French Concession merchants being punished by the French police for violating the provisions of Order No. 158 of the French Consul General's Office of April 12, 1940, regarding the mandatory marking of prices of goods. It has also been found that some merchants quickly raised prices when the French currency recently depreciated, but did not adjust prices after the exchange rate improved, which is extremely inappropriate. A final warning is hereby issued to the merchants concerned, urging them not to test the law.

### Pawnshops Shorten Pawn Period to Twelve Months, Effective June 1

The Shanghai Pawnshop Guild has resolved to shorten the pawn period to twelve months, effective June 1. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Guild yesterday that the industry, in view of the fact that current clothing styles are constantly changing and becoming novel, and that sales are actually difficult after the original eighteen-month expiration, has decided to shorten the period from the original eighteen months to twelve months. All new and old pawnshops in the two Shanghai concessions will implement this uniformly from June 1.

### Japan's Ambition to Invade the Dutch East Indies Not Permitted by Facts. Rumors of Increased Japanese Troops on Hainan Island Difficult to Verify. Dutch Government Rules Over People's Property

Yesterday afternoon, it was rumored in the city market that 150,000 Japanese troops had landed on Hainan Island to increase defenses. Those who easily believed the rumors explained that the Japanese military's actions were due to the increasingly tense situation in the Dutch East Indies. The reporter believed that the Japanese army had recently suffered defeats in Henan and Hubei, and the counter-offensive power of the Chinese army was unstoppable. The Japanese army was only worried about reinforcing the front lines in Central China, and how could it leisurely dispatch troops to Hainan Island to increase defenses? Furthermore, the number of 150,000 is not something that Japan can quickly mobilize at present.

No Ability to Increase Defenses in Hainan

According to a foreign military expert familiar with Far East defenses, after the Japanese side occupied Hainan Island in February last year, it drafted a plan to open up a naval port to build a base for the Japanese navy in the South China Sea, as a base for southward aggression. However, the current tension in Southeast Asia refers to the possibility of the Japanese military taking the opportunity to seize the Dutch East Indies, not that any third country will attack the Japanese military's base. Therefore, it makes no sense for the Japanese side to mobilize large armies to strengthen the defenses of the occupied Hainan Island. If they want to invade the Dutch East Indies, they should use naval power, which cannot be achieved by increasing troops in Hainan Island. Moreover, Hainan Island's military strategic position in the Japanese southward policy is second only to Taiwan. It is necessary to first consolidate the defenses of Taiwan before defending Hainan Island. However, the Japanese side is still facing great economic difficulties due to the war of aggression against China, making it impossible to realize its plans to strengthen Taiwan's defenses, as recently frankly expressed by Taiwan Governor Kobayashi in Tokyo. Therefore, the plan to defend Hainan Island is even more powerless to promote. Therefore, the rumor of a large army increasing defenses is factually impossible.

Dutch East Indies Rules People's Property

The Dutch Embassy counselor issued a statement yesterday that the Dutch government issued an order in London on the 24th of this month to protect the private and corporate property of the Netherlands and to avoid actions that infringe on the interests of individuals and the state. The order also stated that all kinds of rights belonging to individuals or companies residing in or having legal domicile in the Dutch Empire, such as gold deposits, stocks, and margin, have become state property since May 24, in order to properly manage them under the principle of preserving the interests of all owners. However, if the private or company was not residing in a place outside the occupied area of the Netherlands by May 15, then all the benefits will be returned after the war. The order is simultaneously implemented in the Dutch East Indies.

Dutch East Indies Joins the British and French Currency System

The Dutch Chargé d'Affaires in Shanghai announced yesterday that the Dutch East Indies government has joined the British and French cash trade agreement on the 21st of this month. He has received a telegram from Batavia stating that trade between the Dutch East Indies and the sterling bloc will be settled in sterling, and the official exchange rate set for Dutch currency against sterling is 7.6 Dutch currency (Guilder) to 1 sterling. However, for countries that have not joined the British and French trade agreement and are blocked, this trade is limited to settlement in US dollars, or payment is allowed in other foreign currencies that the Java Bank has declared acceptable. After further necessary adjustments to the British and French cash trade agreement, it will be implemented in the near future. As for the exchange rate between Dutch currency and US dollars, it is 0.5308 US dollars per Dutch currency. Due to the sufficient reserves of the Dutch East Indies Bank, various adjustment measures adopted by the Dutch East Indies government have been implemented. The current Dutch East Indies is strictly controlling foreign exchange and foreign trade, and has restricted the export of goods from sterling bloc countries to third countries.

No Disputes Between Germans and Dutch People in Peiping

It was previously reported that after the Netherlands and Belgium were invaded by Germany, the Dutch Embassy in Peiping had notified the Germans in some Dutch-owned properties in Dongjiaominxiang to move out, and that the German School and General Association were now moving into the former Austrian Embassy and expelling all Dutch residents as retaliation. When the reporter from the Peiming News Agency inquired about this matter with Mr. R. Flaes, the counselor of the Dutch Embassy in Shanghai, Mr. Flaes replied as follows: The Dutch Embassy in Peiping has indeed notified the German General Association to move out, but the association has not yet implemented it, or may do so, which is unknown, but there have been absolutely no disputes. As for the rumor that the German side in Peiping will expel all Dutch residents in retaliation, it is completely inaccurate.

### Armed Bandits Rampant, Business People and Civilians Take Note

Recently, cases of armed robbery within the concession have occurred repeatedly, seriously affecting public security. All parties hope that the concession authorities will quickly adopt effective preventive measures to ensure that businesses can operate safely and innocent civilians are not harassed. The public hopes that as armed lawbreakers are so rampant, police inspection work should be strengthened and implemented immediately. In addition, suppressing prices and cracking down on speculation and manipulation is an even more fundamental solution. It is especially hoped that the planned progress will be actively promoted, and the improvement of the situation in the western part of Shanghai is also urgently needed. Some parties also hope that in the current situation, businesses must be particularly cautious about collecting payment for goods, and citizens should carry as little cash as possible when going out. As for women dressing extravagantly, it is unnecessary and only invites covetousness.

### Shanghai Customs Benefited by the European War, Foreign Trade Surges. This City's Trade with Britain and France Turns into a Surplus. Trade with India and Cotton Exports Are the Most Prosperous

During the last European War, Japan benefited from remaining neutral and was able to leap to become an industrial nation. British Asian markets, including the colonies, were invaded by Japanese goods. Although China failed to fully utilize the opportunity due to frequent internal unrest, all kinds of industries also began to sprout at this time. In the past, China's tariffs were restricted by treaties, but domestic industries were still able to have some scale. This has to be said to be a gift of the European War. This time, China is in the midst of the Anti-Japanese War, and the war zones are extensive, with many large and small industries destroyed. It is difficult to take advantage of the opportunity. Japan is even more mired in the quagmire, and its manpower and material resources cannot take care of everything, and sits by and watches the passing of a great opportunity. Shanghai's isolated island, due to the concessions,

Avoids Bombardment

In the past one or two years, due to the war, it has uniquely enjoyed abnormal development. With the outbreak of the European War, Western goods cannot be smoothly transported to the Far East, and the city's industries are even more stimulated and more lively. According to investigations by a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency with relevant parties, if the flames of war in Western Europe do not spread to Asia, then this city's industries still have the hope of development, and foreign trade will also improve. China's trade with European countries is mostly in deficit. With shipping blocked, European goods cannot come east, which reduces the deficit. Recently, Britain and France have purchased many livestock products and raw materials from China, and the city's trade with Britain and France has changed from deficit

To Surplus

The city's export trade with Southeast Asia is also showing a sudden surge. For example, if we compare this year's export trade with the previous one or two years, it has increased several times, and some have increased to dozens of times. For example, from January to April this year, goods shipped from this city to India were valued at 36 million yuan, an increase of more than twenty times compared to 1.4 million yuan in the previous year. Other places such as Siam, Singapore, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Hong Kong, Annam, Burma, etc. have also ordered many times more goods from the Shanghai market than in previous years, especially raw silk, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth exports, the most prosperous. The two items of cotton yarn and cotton cloth alone reached more than 100 million. If the city's foreign shipping does not stop, there is hope for future development.

### The American Flagship Augusta Sailed to North China Yesterday. When Will the Marblehead Come to Shanghai? There is No Definite News Yet

The flagship Augusta of the US Navy's Asian Fleet and Admiral Hord's private yacht Isabell sailed from Little Luzon via Hong Kong to Shanghai at the beginning of last month and moored at the British Navy pontoon on the Yangjingbang River. After berthing in Shanghai for nearly two months, it weighed anchor and sailed out of the port at 2:00 pm yesterday. The yacht Isabell sailed out of the port 25 minutes before the flagship raised its flag. It is said that they are both going to North China for patrol. As for the previous report that the giant US cruiser Marblehead would come to Shanghai after the flagship Augusta left Shanghai, there is no news yet when it will arrive in Shanghai.

### The Japanese Army Surrounded at the Junction of Kunshan and Qingpu. Attacked by Gu Fusheng's Troops. More Than Ten Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded

According to reliable merchant sources from the Qingpu County area, a small team of Japanese soldiers was suddenly surrounded and fiercely attacked by Gu Fusheng's troops of the Third Detachment of the Songhu Guerrilla Force of the Chinese Army when they were passing through the villages of An Ting, Lujia Bang and Bai He Jiang on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line the day before yesterday. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded on the spot, and they fled towards the railway line. Afterwards, a large number of Japanese troops went to search, but found nothing. In addition, although the large number of Japanese troops has withdrawn after the Japanese army carried out a massacre on the Qingpu-Shanghai highway last month, the order in the area has not yet recovered. Some of the Japanese troops and the puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army" are still stationed in Guanyintang, Lujiage and other places, so the villagers, except for the old, weak, women and children, still dare not return to their villages. As for the troops under Gu Fusheng, after this anti-"mopping-up" battle, their main force has now moved westward and concentrated in a safe place for training. The rumor that they are active in the Wusong area is not accurate.

### American Vessels Seize Opportunity to Rise, Taking on European-Asian Shipping, Italian Ships Cease Operations, French Mail Still Operates, but Sailings East of Hong Kong are Kept Secret

Since the Italian postal shipping company was suddenly ordered to cease its Far East express mail service, only the French postal shipping company remains operating the European line in this port. However, if Italy declares war, whether the French postal shipping company's ships will also take a detour and how they will operate in the future has attracted general attention.

French Vessel Activity

According to sources, the French postal shipping company has not yet received any orders from its government. Therefore, the company's postal and cargo ships are still operating according to their original routes without any changes. However, the itineraries of postal and cargo ships, even east of Hong Kong, are being kept strictly confidential. Except for passengers, no further announcements are being made. It is rumored that a French postal ship will arrive in Shanghai from the Mediterranean within the next few days, but its name and arrival date are being kept secret. As for what changes will be made to the company's ship routes in the event of a change in the situation, it is currently unknown. However, it is claimed that, like British ships, they will bypass the Mediterranean and sail around the Cape of Good Hope.

American Vessel Activity

The United States President Lines will become increasingly active due to the expansion of the European war. In addition to maintaining its existing ships operating between Europe, Asia, and America, the company has recently announced plans to increase ships and expand routes. It is rumored that this plan will be implemented soon. Therefore, even if Italy participates in the war, the shipping traffic between Europe, Asia, and America will not be interrupted. It is rumored that the company's postal ship, President Cleveland, will sail from Shanghai via San Francisco and Los Angeles to New York, USA, on July 7th. The World Class postal ship, President Garfield, will sail from Shanghai via Hong Kong, Luzon, Colombo, and Mumbai, etc., via the Mediterranean to various European ports around July 15th, before returning to the United States.

### British Residents in This Port Hold Special Prayers, Large Crowds Participate, British Consul and Others Also Attend

The North-China Daily News reports that the British King designated May 26th as a day for the Empire and Allied nations to hold prayers. British people everywhere responded. British residents in this city also gathered at the Great Hall on Jiangxi Road and the New Tianan Church on Suzhou Road on the morning of the 26th to participate in special prayers, providing enthusiastic spiritual support to the British forces at the front. The prayer service in the Great Hall began at 10:30 AM. The British people who attended were extremely crowded. The hall was not large enough to accommodate everyone, so those who arrived later stood on the grass. Therefore, loudspeakers were temporarily installed outside the hall to allow them to listen to the speeches. British Consul-General George and British army and naval officers participated in the prayers. Furthermore, a large number of Jewish people prayed for the victory of the Allied nations at the two synagogues on Museum Road and Seymour Road.

### Haifu Sails to Ningbo Without Carrying Relief Rice, Denied Entry, First Affected by Japanese Detention, Then Obstructed for Violating Orders

The Ningbo-Shaoxing area of Eastern Zhejiang has suffered a drought this year, and food supplies are worrying. Various charitable organizations in this city are actively raising funds to purchase foreign rice for relief efforts. The Ningbo authorities, to facilitate the unloading of relief rice, have specially allowed small rice-carrying boats to enter directly to the Jiangbei shore. As a result, the number of ships participating in direct voyages has reached six so far. However, the Changde and Gaodeng ships were specially approved, so they can enter even without carrying relief rice. The other four ships cannot enter unless they carry relief rice. Last week, the Jardine Matheson's Haifu ship sailed directly to Ningbo from Shanghai for the second time. A few hundred bags of rice were loaded onto the ship and transported to Ningbo the day before, but they were unreasonably detained by the Japanese authorities. Although they were released after lobbying, the rice could not be transported to Ningbo. Therefore, the Haifu ship did not carry relief rice this time.

The ship sailed to the mouth of Zhenhai on the morning of the 24th and waited for inspection as usual before entering. Unexpectedly, after the inspection, it was denied entry because it did not carry relief rice. It had to anchor outside the port, while further requests were made to the authorities.

Still Unresolved

It is heard that passengers have been transported to Ningbo for disembarkation by barges hired by the company. The cargo on board has not yet been unloaded, so the date of the ship's return to Shanghai is uncertain. According to company sources, the matter has been resolved and the ship will return to Shanghai within days. However, the issue that future direct ships will not be allowed to enter if they do not carry rice is a major issue.

### The Seventh Branch of the Central Military Academy Continues to Recruit Students in Ningbo

The Seventh Branch of the Central Military Academy recruited students in Ningbo last year, and the number of applicants was very enthusiastic. More than a thousand students were admitted and embarked on a grand "Long March". They are now approaching graduation. It is now heard that the school, to train military cadres, has decided to recruit a large number of young people with high school grades or above in Zhejiang. The Education Director, Mr. Hu Zongshan, has telegraphed Mr. Cai Zhuping, Director of the Political Work Guidance Office in the Sixth District, to appoint him as the Director of the Ningbo Recruitment Office of the school. It is scheduled to be established immediately, with the address attached to the Commercial School at No. 90 Beida Xian Road, Ningbo.

### Case of Undutiful Son Instigating Robbery, Eldest Son Released as Uninvolved, Police Prosecute for Attempted Robbery

Wang Gongyun, a native of Yantai residing in Room 812, 8th Floor, YMCA, Baxianqiao, used to trade in Korea and served as president of the local chamber of commerce. He retired from his position due to age and came to Shanghai to live a life of leisure at sea, residing alone in the YMCA. At 8 AM on the 16th of this month, when Wang returned to his room from the dining room on the ninth floor, there were already two well-dressed young men waiting in the room, seemingly visitors. When the two young men saw Wang arrive, they

Pulled Out Guns to Intimidate

and tried to put a rope around Wang's throat. Wang shouted loudly for help, and the two young thugs immediately rushed out of the door. Ge Lan, an attendant at No. 84, captured the young man Huang Fachang who was holding the rope and handed him over to the police. One of the thugs ran down the stairs and escaped from the back door. After interrogation by the police, Huang Fachang confessed that the man who escaped was named Lu Xiji and that this matter was instigated by Wang's two sons, Wang Mingxing and Wang Mingyao. Therefore, Detective Yan Jinwen went to No. 33 Yudan Lane, Baer Road, based on Huang's confession and arrested the Wang Mingxing and Wang Mingyao brothers, who were then taken to the Special No. 2 Court for investigation and detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. This case was further heard yesterday morning in the Criminal Division One by Magistrate Zhang Minsheng. The police lawyer, Chen Ming, presented the case, prosecuting Huang Fachang and Wang Mingyao for attempted robbery. After investigation by the police, it was found that Wang Mingxing had

Admonished His Brother

not to commit such a heinous and undutiful act, but Mingyao ultimately ignored his brother's advice. Therefore, the police did not prosecute Wang Mingxing and requested his release first. When questioned, Huang and Wang confessed to participating in the matter, and that Ke Shaorong, who is still at large, was also present at the scene. After verifying the confessions, the court ordered a further hearing on the morning of the 31st. Wang Mingxing was not prosecuted by the police and should be released.

### Thugs Resist Arrest, Police Return Fire to Apprehend, Stray Bullets Injure Four People

At around 8 PM last night, a man in his thirties was loitering near Hedde Road and Singapore Road in West Shanghai. He was spotted by two Chinese constables, Nos. 2005 and 7970, who found his behavior suspicious and ordered him to stop for questioning and search. Unexpectedly, the man, upon seeing the police approach, immediately drew his handgun and opened fire to resist arrest, turning to flee. The two constables pursued closely, returning fire. Bullets flew everywhere for a time, causing great chaos and prompting passersby to flee for their lives. The two sides exchanged fire for about twenty rounds. Some passersby were hit by stray bullets, and the man escaped into the crowd and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the Chinese constables summoned ambulances to transport the four injured people to the Red Cross Hospital and Renji Hospital for treatment. The injured were identified as Wu Fugen (22 years old), a native of Yixing, residing in an unnumbered bungalow on Hedde Road, with a left leg injury; Wang Changlong (23 years old), a native of Anhui, residing at No. 1475 Rue Robert, with a buttock injury, the bullet did not penetrate; Wu Baodi (18 years old), with a right leg injury; and Yang Cunxiang (48 years old), a native of Jiangbei, working as a cook at the Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' School, with a stray bullet hitting his chest, which did not penetrate, causing serious injuries and endangering his life.

### Ticket Seller and Driver Neglect Duties, Passenger Dies After Being Run Over, Case to be Investigated Before Further Inquiry

The British-owned Shanghai Public Omnibus Company's No. 15032 Route 10 bus, driven by driver Wang Baohua (No. 463) and with ticket seller Chen Bin (No. 708), stopped at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Park Road at 9:35 AM the day before. At that time, many passengers were getting on and off the bus. Passenger Chen Afa and his wife, Zhang, were also boarding at that location. Chen had already boarded the bus, and Zhang was in the process of climbing the metal pole when the bus suddenly started moving, traveling about twenty feet. Zhang, unable to hold on, lost her grip and fell, resulting in her head being crushed by the rear wheel. She died instantly. Chinese constables from No. 2912 arrived, sent the deceased's body to the coroner's office, and took the driver Wang Baohua and ticket seller Chen Bin into custody. They were sent to Special Court No. 1 Division 2 yesterday morning, requesting detention. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin's statement of the case, the current dispute is whether the ticket seller had already rung the bell. The deceased's husband and the Chinese constables reported hearing the bell, but witness Xu Changfa testified that the bus door was not closed. According to the police investigation, the bell would not ring if the bus door was not closed. The case requires further investigation, and a request was made for a postponement. Wang Baohua stated that he heard the bell ring before starting the bus, but Chen Bin claimed that the bell was not rung, the bus door was not closed, and he did not know how the bus suddenly started. The court ordered a postponement of seven days for further hearing after the coroner's report.

### Dancer Accuses Husband of Bigamy, Wei Luming Arrested, Interrogated, and Ordered Back into Custody, Claims Accusation Stems from Frustrated Extortion Attempt

Wei Luming, also known as Fu Gen, a 27-year-old native of Nanhui who resides at No. 33 Lafei Fang, Lafei Road, and operates a construction business, married Jin Suzhen (the same age as Wei), a fellow villager, in his hometown in 1930, introduced by Wei Guifu and Yang Yousheng.

### Cruller Vendor Slashes Two People, Altercation Over Purchase of Crullers

Ke Changkui (40 years old), a native of Yangzhou, and Guo Changlong (59 years old), both worked as cooks at the Tianle Yuan Restaurant at No. 638 Hankou Road.

Gong Mei, a 17-year-old girl from Haimen residing at No. 6 Xinhe Fang, Yanshan Road, Hongkou, used to work at a factory with Chen Hongying (17 years old), a girl from Tongzhou. Chen then accepted a job at the Yangong Tour Agency at Room 59, Laobaohe Hotel, No. 11, Lane 420, Guangdong Road, working as a "tour girl," responding to calls day and night, and going to various hotels to engage in prostitution. On the 23rd of this month, Chen, using the pretext of working at a cigarette factory, went to Gong Mei's place and lured Gong out, taking her directly to the Yangong Tour Agency, forcing her to become a tour girl. For three days, although she was only hired for nine hours, she was raped twice by patrons. The nine yuan she earned was also taken by the agency, and Gong did not receive a single cent. Unable to endure the abuse, she escaped the day before yesterday and told her father, Gong Xiaoqing, who reported the incident to the Yulin Road police station. Detectives Yuan Xinzhong and Wu Wenfa went to the Yangong Tour Agency and arrested Chen Hongying and the accountant, Xu Heshang. The agency owners, Jiang Fushan and Fang Er, were at large. They were taken to the police station and sent to Criminal Division 2 of Special Court No. 1 yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin brought charges of luring into prostitution. Gong Mei also reported that she had been tricked into becoming a tour girl by Chen Hongying, who had lodged and raped her. When questioned, the defendants' statements were evasive. Magistrate Fu ordered them to be remanded in custody for further verification in seven days.

At 9:45 AM yesterday morning, five customers, all dressed in Western suits, suddenly arrived at the Yunfei Motor Car Company's branch station at No. 101 Songding Pan Road, West Shanghai. The accountant instructed driver Yu Yongfu, No. 134, to drive a taxi, No. 12256, westward. Upon reaching the entrance of the Country Club on Columbia Road, two more people were waiting on the side of the road, signaling the taxi to stop. They jumped into the car and ordered it to drive to the intersection of Kaixuan Road and Anhe Temple Road. The customers instructed the driver to stop the car. Two of them pulled out handguns from their pockets and threatened the driver, forcing Yu Yongfu out of the car and stripping him of his uniform. Two people were assigned to watch him in a remote area, while the other five drove the car away. About half an hour later, the car returned to the original location and was returned to the driver. The bandits then left. Afterwards, Yu Yongfu reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple police station for investigation. The police chief immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to conduct a thorough investigation within their jurisdiction to determine if any cases of kidnapping had occurred.

### Elementary School Teacher Ma Bole Rapes a Married Woman, Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment After Being Caught

Ma Bole, also known as Ma Zhenbang, a 37-year-old native of Suzhou, works as a teacher at the Tiantong Elementary School on Tiantong Road. Gao Taisheng, a native of Suzhou working as a tea server at the Far Eastern Hotel residing at No. 724 Qunyu Fang, Guangdong Road, has a nine-year-old daughter, Zhao Di, who studies at the school where Ma teaches. Because Zhao Di is lively and innocent, Ma sometimes sends her home after school, which led to his acquaintance with Gao's wife, Hu Yuying (30 years old, a native of Changshu). Although Hu is

Middle-Aged, She Possesses Some Beauty, and Ma Developed Improper Thoughts. Using the excuse of sending Zhao Di home, he exchanged glances with Hu, and over time, the two developed feelings for each other. In September of last year, they had an affair. The two were deeply infatuated and, in December of last year, secretly eloped to Suzhou, also taking with them more than 500 yuan in cash. Later, due to a lack of money, Hu had no choice but to return to her husband's home, and Gao forgave her and allowed her to live with him again. Hu also expressed

Repentance, and the couple reconciled. However, recently, Hu was enticed by Ma and rekindled their old affair, engaging in clandestine meetings. On the night of the 18th of this month, while Gao was working his shift, Ma sneaked in to continue their affair. Just as they were naked and enjoying their dream, Gao unexpectedly returned home at 12:30 AM to retrieve something and discovered their affair. Furious, he tied up Ma, doused him with cold water, and reported the incident to the Zhabei police station. Chinese detective Zhou Wenqing arrested both the adulterer and adulteress

and brought them back to the police station. Ma, having been frightened after the affair and doused with cold water, suffered severe abdominal pain and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Gao Taisheng still hoped that his wife would repent, so he expressed his unwillingness to pursue charges, and she was released. Ma has now recovered and was sent to Criminal Division 4 of Special Court No. 1 this morning. Police lawyer Peng Qixin brought charges of adultery. When questioned, Ma fully confessed. Magistrate Rong Duo, considering that the defendant was a teacher and yet committed such an act, sentenced Ma Bole to six months imprisonment, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day, to serve as a punishment and a warning to others.

In addition to drafting a five-year implementation plan for national education in the province, it has also formulated a teacher training plan for national education this year. The outline is as follows: (1) To supply the first batch of teachers for national education in the province, a three-month training course will be held, with a quota of 10,000 people. (2) Training schools for national education teachers will be established and managed separately by county. This year, 60 counties, including Taishan and Qujiang, will establish training schools. Counties that do not establish schools will temporarily send students to neighboring counties with training schools for training. (3) The county magistrate will serve as the director of each training school, and the president of the local provincial normal school or high school will serve as the deputy director. (4) Local secondary schools and the equipment and personnel of various government agencies will be utilized as much as possible for equipment and education. (5) This period will run from June 25th to September 25th this year, for a total of three months. (6) This period will require a total expenditure of 140,000 yuan, which will be borne equally by the central and provincial treasuries. The central government's subsidy portion has been approved by the Ministry of Education for an appropriation of 225,000 yuan. The Provincial Department of Education has also requested the provincial government to allocate funds for the establishment of national education schools under its jurisdiction in the second half of this year, with the central and provincial governments each bearing 25% and the county and local governments bearing 50%.

### Hong Kong Authorities Show Understanding to Schools After Implementing New School Building Regulations, Instructing That Exemption from Relocation May Be Granted After Improvements

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong authorities implemented new school building regulations and sent personnel to inspect various schools. Any facilities that did not meet hygiene standards were shut down, and notices were issued requiring relocation within a recent period, which greatly affected the schools. In particular, the charitable schools were most severely affected. Most of the students at these charitable schools are from poor families. If they were shut down, these poor students would lose their opportunity to study. Therefore, the various overseas Chinese countries that sponsor these charitable schools will jointly petition the authorities to postpone the implementation of the new regulations in order to prevent thousands of students from losing their education. It is now found that the authorities in the Department of Education have already replied that they will not approve the request, but will handle the matter with flexibility. They will send personnel to investigate the various schools again and provide instructions for improvement to avoid relocation, allowing them to continue classes at their original locations. However, the non-compliant areas of the schools, such as the kitchen and lighting, must be improved, and the number of students must be reduced. It is heard that the same treatment will be applied to other schools. If improvement is possible, relocation will not be strictly enforced. However, if the hygiene standards are too low and cannot be improved, then elimination is inevitable.

A certain money changer issued twenty taels to the silver shop, and the silver shop traded with each other for ten taels, both for five thousand seven hundred and fifty-five yuan. After this, another money changer and securities gang mutually bought, immediately rising twenty-five yuan. The securities gang entered the silver shop for fifty taels, for five thousand seven hundred and eighty yuan. Subsequently, the exchange market announced that it was hardening, and the selling wind re-emerged. Money changers and retail investors competed to stuff out, and for a while, there was a lack of buyers, dropping by fifty-five yuan. The silver shop gang released thirty taels to the gold shop, for five thousand seven hundred and twenty-five yuan. At this time, the gold shop gang was low and cheap and reeled it in, and the market situation turned stable, returning to five thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan. Later, the foreign exchange suddenly announced that it was softening. The buying wind was very large, and money changers and securities gangs dragged in a lot. The price then rushed out of the five thousand eight hundred yuan mark. The silver shop issued fifty taels to the money exchange trade, and the securities gang traded twenty taels, both for five thousand eight hundred and ten yuan. At noon, a certain money exchange suddenly went from entering to exiting, and the foreign exchange had stopped tightening and returned to flat. Although the Hong Kong gang was mediating and absorbing slightly at this time, the head office still felt ample, stepping down twenty-five yuan. The silver shop traded twenty taels, for five thousand seven hundred and eighty-five yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon market was quiet, and the head office gold shop traded ten taels with each other, still for five thousand seven hundred and eighty-five yuan. Then the silver shop stuffed out slightly, five yuan smaller. The silver shop issued ten taels to the money changer, inferior to five thousand seven hundred and eighty yuan. Later, a certain silver building reeled in nearly a hundred taels on behalf of a customer, and there were several short positions to cover, so it raised ten yuan, the gold shop entered the silver shop for fifty taels, for five thousand eight hundred yuan. After entering, the buyers stopped pulling, and it retreated by five yuan, the money changer issued twenty taels to the gold shop, for five thousand seven hundred and ninety-five yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it rose by nine yuan compared to the end of last week. The entire day saw an eighty-five yuan rise and fall. The selling price of the cash gold of the current card number was more expensive than the boiled gold by ten yuan. The intake was reduced by thirty yuan. The current target gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little to do.

Jewelry is Stationary All Day

The exchange of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops did not change throughout the day. Da Tong Heng still had the original price of five hundred and ninety yuan. The new trade was the same as the above price, and the intake was reduced by thirty special scenes.

### Discount Rate Rises by Another Five Yuan, Interest Rate Also Rises by One Point

Yesterday's exchange rate discount rate for drafts gradually increased from low to high. Initially, it was around 125 yuan per thousand yuan, with the smallest discount of 122 yuan. Later, the asking price gradually rose to 130 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 135 yuan. Finally, it was 132 yuan, which was an increase of five yuan compared to Saturday. The money industry association's interest rate also continued to rise. Both the morning and noon markets were listed at 2.8 points, and then rose by one point.

### Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Differently

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slight need for English and American pounds. The market price rose slightly. There was no shortage of supply of English gold notes, and the market price was weak. The US dollar bill was slightly tight in the black market, resulting in a demand exceeding supply, but the increase was limited. Hong Kong bills rose slightly with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. French francs and Annam bills suddenly had a supply, and the market price trended lower. The Canadian bill trended weak, and the market price fell. Philippine bills were in demand, and the market price rose sharply. The need for Japanese gold bills and Korean bills increased sharply, and the rise was frequent and fierce. The former had risen to 1 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen 5 li, and the latter had risen to 9 jiao 6 fen 5 li.

### Securities: Overseas Stock Market is Bleak, Domestic Debt Business is Desolate

Yesterday's stock market remained unchanged, and female transactions became increasingly quiet. The gold and foreign exchange markets were stable. The bulls and bears were watching and holding on as much as possible. Before the biggest changes in the international war are revealed, it may be difficult to change temporarily. The market was firm in kind E because the ninth draw will be held on June 10th. Those who buy now include the right to the ninth draw. Yesterday's lack of buying and selling was unprecedented. In the morning, Zhi Tong Kang slightly provided, which was absorbed by Runli. In the afternoon, Yi Tai Lian Yi slightly purchased, which was supplied by Xinhua Yichang. As a result, only type E was slightly better by five points, and the rest were slightly smaller by five corners to two and a half corners. Type B had no highs and lows, and the turnover was less than 300,000 yuan. The following is a brief table.

In stock trading, five Upper Trust shares were traded, with a price of 10 yuan 1 jiao.

The opening price of various public industrial shares was the highest in the day. They then fluctuated in a narrow range. The closing price was slightly higher than the lower price. The demand for Zhongying Real Estate shares was excellent, and the price rose from 7 yuan 2 jiao to 8 yuan 1 jiao, and closed at 8 yuan 05 fen.

Rubber shares trended firmer, and the turnover was not large. The prices of each share (that is, the shares of each Dutch Indian company) rose. Koloa shares had the largest turnover. The price rose from 1 yuan 4 jiao 4 fen at the close on Friday to 1 yuan 7 jiao. Among the shares of various Malaysian companies, Rubber Trust also rose sharply. The price rose from 7 yuan 3 jiao at the opening to 8 yuan at the buying close.

### Cotton Yarn: Hong Kong Merchants Handle Coarse Yarn, Double Horse Brings Up Sixty Yuan

The yarn market, which had fallen for two consecutive days, rose again yesterday, because the demand for coarse and fine yarns in South China was constant. Thus, human sentiment was revived and took a step higher, but the overseas cotton industry was still mediocre.

The atmosphere of the current yarn morning opening was moderate, the price of 20-count double horse yarn was 1,250 yuan, and it fell slightly to 1,245 yuan. However, it was learned that the Hong Kong gang was eagerly purchasing 10-count yarn. Human sentiment suddenly rose, and the buying momentum suddenly became fierce. The market slowly rose to 1,300 yuan, and slightly fell back by ten yuan in the middle. According to the turnover statistics in half a day, there were 1,925 bales. The price of 20-count double horse yarn rose by 60 yuan. Yesterday, there were 160 pieces of cotton yarn, and today, there will be another 760 pieces shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows.

Tong Hang: 520 Yunnan: 130 Hong Kong: 1,145 Ningbo: 50 Wenzhou: 80 Total: 1,925

### Limited Cotton Transactions

Cotton transactions are very few. Only the American cotton, Indian cotton, and Qingdao brokers are quite active, but general sentiment is so-so. The current cotton transaction details are listed below:

Pengjia Pu: 244.00, Qingdao brokers buying 200 bales, 244.00 to 295.00

Middling: 299.00, also 300 bales, 297.00

Kang Jianghua: 220.00, fellow merchants buying 100 bales

Tongzhou Cotton: 32.60, also 300 bales

Furthermore, regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market was particularly stable yesterday, but due to the weekend, trading was less active. As a result, closing prices for the near term were up 3 points (British pounds) compared to the previous day, while the far term was down 23 points. The Indian cotton market was also very quiet, with the result, including forecasts, being up more than one rupee compared to the previous day.

Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai are limited due to the tight credit of all parties at the end of the month. Except for a few who were in urgent need of funds and reluctantly sold at reduced prices, sentiment among all parties tended to improve. Therefore, according to the current situation, spot goods are scarce in the market. If the spot goods can be stored past the end of the month and the Tianjin merchants make some purchases, the market situation will immediately turn bullish. The cotton market prices yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of 5.5 yuan for US currency, for delivery to factories are as follows:

20 count American Middling: 305.6

also lower grade: 296.00

32 count: 323.50

also lower grade: 314.90

42 count European: 326.90

also lower grade: 316.80

### Grains: Foreign Rice Weak; Japanese Merchants Buy Ximi Rice Again

The rice market concluded on a weak note the week before last. Yesterday, both buyers and sellers adopted a cautious attitude. According to investigations, Shanghai's inventory is only slightly over 500,000 bags, forming a stalemate between the two sides. The market remained inactive for a long time. Activity was only seen in the central market, with limited transactions. Prices for various goods depreciated by 20 to 30 cents. Chenxi brand No. 1 (past harvest) was still bought at 51.5 yuan and 51 yuan; No. 2 at 49 yuan and 48.5 yuan; Siamese No. 1 at 50 yuan and 49.7 yuan; No. 2 at 48.5 yuan and 48.1 yuan; Fire-marked rice at 50.05 yuan to 49.5 yuan; Min Dai rice at 49 yuan and 48.4 yuan; Small Jiaojian rice at 48.4 yuan and 48.2 yuan; Tokyo Jian rice at 47.5 yuan, down to 46.3 yuan; Mixed broken rice at 45 yuan and 44 yuan; Mi Lu rice at 46.5 yuan and 46 yuan.

Although 3,000 to 4,000 bags of foreign rice were purchased by Hangzhou and other inland brokers yesterday, shops and rural households in this street have so far lacked appetite due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival. Nanyang brokers also did not inquire. Ningbo brokers were blocked and stopped trading. Transactions on this street were only slightly over 2,000 bags, so prices gradually weakened after opening. The afternoon close was already down about half a yuan. The market rallied by 40 to 50 cents at one point in the afternoon, but remained weak at the evening close. New transactions are being negotiated, but no formal deals have been made yet.

More foreign rice arrived. Yesterday, Taikoo's Qingyuan vessel arrived in Shanghai, carrying 2,475 bags from Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng also arrived at the port, carrying 1,324 bags from Hong Kong. A total of 4,799 bags of foreign rice arrived yesterday.

The arrival of Japonica and glutinous domestic rice is still only 1,000 to 2,000 bags. The glutinous rice sales floor is still active due to seasonal demand, but it is less active than before. Therefore, supply and demand are similar, and there are no large price fluctuations. Kaijin Li special Yuan rice: 44.8 yuan and 44.5 yuan; High: 44 yuan; Dan Chang goods: 42 to 43 yuan, varying prices. Off-market trading of Japonica rice is also said to be sluggish, and selling prices are mediocre along with other goods. Wuxi special Qing Japonica rice: 53 yuan; High Qing Japonica: 52 yuan; Chang Kun white Japonica: 51 yuan; second-grade to old goods: 49 yuan; Qing Si special thin Japonica: 52 to 53 yuan; big market: 51 yuan; second-grade to old: around 49 yuan; Nangang early rice: high from 50 yuan; second-grade to 48 or 49 yuan.

The Wuxi rice market has been trending upward again recently because Japanese merchants are buying in bulk, with a fixed quota of 10,000 piculs. The factory price is 32 yuan, making it difficult to loosen in the short term. On the 25th, when the market opened, high white Japonica was 32 yuan to 31.78 yuan per picul; high brown Japonica was 30 yuan; market high was 29.8 yuan; high Japonica rice was 15.23 yuan per dan; Yuan rice was 14 yuan; high white Yang Xian was 35 yuan; high white Da Zi Xian was 34 yuan. Japonica rice is the most popular, and Da Zi Yang Jian goods are scarce, with prices exceeding the market price of Japonica rice by two or three yuan. (Good

### Extremely Few Flour Transactions; New Wheat from Xiyi on the Market

The flour market remains stagnant. Transactions with local merchants are uniformly quiet. Due to difficulties in shipping and high factory prices, new transactions are difficult to develop. Therefore, factories may secretly be willing to lower prices to local merchants. However, the wholesale price on this street has already been reduced to 13.8 yuan, making it difficult to lower it further at this time. Transactions on this street are only for daily needs and there is no progress. The assorted flour from Wuxi and other places has recently been favored by inland brokers. Those holding goods are taking the opportunity to be opportunistic, still asking for a price of 13.6 to 13.7 yuan. Therefore, most inland brokers are directly purchasing and transporting from the place of production, causing the Shanghai market to feel lonely. Returned goods of old brands are also being abandoned.

Wheat transactions are as quiet as ever. At present, old wheat has already been removed from the market and new wheat has not yet been launched, which is the time when new and old are not connected. Before the opening day, Er Xin Xing factory handled several hundred bags at a price of 22 yuan. Yesterday the market heard that it was 21 yuan, because old wheat quality has many differences, and there is no formal market to discuss.

Wuxi flour, because there are still two weeks before the new wheat is available, the old goods are mostly transported to Beijing, Shanghai and Xiyi, and the bottom of the warehouse is limited. In recent days, the price of flour has risen to 13.5 to 13.6 yuan per bag, which has exceeded the market price in Shanghai and become an inverted market price. The old wheat bottom is drying up and is still sold at 34 yuan (174 market catties per bag). The new wheat has been on the market for more than ten days. The weather has been good for both sunny and rainy days this year, and the seeds are full and golden in color. The asking price is similar to that of old wheat. According to the current weather, the new wheat harvest will be bumper and is expected to be on the market in large quantities after the Dragon Boat Festival. (Good)

### Miscellaneous Grains: New Rapeseed on the Market

News of this year's new small ripe crop is quite concerning due to environmental factors. According to reports from people in various rural industries, the annual yield and output are better than last year. Wenzhou, Pinghu and other broad beans and rapeseeds are the first to be on the market, but due to high costs and the lack of a fixed standard for transportation costs, and the special environment with a lack of transporters, new goods have been delayed in entering the market. Until yesterday, new small samples of black rapeseed from Pinghu were on the market. The goods are indeed superior. It is reported that the production price is 24 or 25 yuan, so few customers are interested.

Also, 1,390 bags of raw peanuts arrived from Yantai yesterday. Today (the 28th), 755 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 2,510 bags were shipped to Singapore.

### Oil Cake: Lively Soybean Cake Transactions; Soybean Oil Rises by 1.5 Yuan

Actual sales and speculative transactions of soybean cake remain undiminished. The various pre-ordered cakes have also begun to be transacted quietly. Although the general situation is in a state of vigorous sentiment, the shipping lines to South China do not have sufficient guarantees, so there is a potential weakness hidden. Although transactions were lively yesterday, market prices remained at the same levels as at the end of last week. It is estimated that 15,000 pieces of Dayou factory's Four Brands cake were transacted and purchased by Quanzhou and Xinghua merchants. Shantou merchants inquired about 13,000 pieces of Shengji cake from the same surname factory and 5,000 pieces of Feizi cake from the Puli factory for June delivery, and 5,000 pieces of Yuanlong cake from the Xiefeng factory for the second half of June. Inland merchants adopted 2,000 pieces of Yuanlong cake and 5,000 pieces of Feizi cake.

The soybean oil market has been weak throughout the past week, which has aroused the appetite of various rural merchants in Suzhou and Wuxi. Generally, manipulation streams seized the opportunity, and the weak and stagnant market was once again monopolized and raised. Yesterday, the market rose by 1.5 yuan compared to Saturday's market. It is estimated that 100 barrels of Dayun oil were opened, with prices detailed in the market price section. 150 pieces of Yanqi oil, 150 pieces of Qingqi oil, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, and 300 dan of Dayou factory oil were opened.

Also, 800 tins of raw oil arrived from Yantai yesterday.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Declines

Yesterday, the sugar market weakened as the exchange rate rose slightly. The guild's listed prices for current goods were 65.2 yuan for No. 2 coarse white sugar at local warehouses, and 64.5 yuan in the afternoon. Foreign warehouse goods initially opened at 65.2 yuan to 64 yuan, and 64.5 yuan in the afternoon, down 1.4 yuan. Transshipment goods arriving on June 3: 52.8 yuan to 51.8 yuan; arriving on May 21: 52.3 yuan to 91 yuan, down 1.7 yuan to 1.6 yuan. Taikoo's old white sugar B mark: 76.2 yuan, 100 bags transacted; new goods: 77.5 yuan, down about 2 yuan. H mark crude red sugar: about 54 yuan; Dutch crude red sugar: 57 yuan, both untraded. Local snow white sugar: 66 yuan. It is said that more than 4,000 pieces of local ice sugar have been ordered before and after, and have not yet been cleared, so there is a lack of continued transactions. Domestic sugar is quiet and lacks transactions. 3,389 bags of sugar and 262 boxes of sugar slices arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Seafood: Western Light Dishes and Qicai Both Decline

The previous market price of Luodan vegetables was 190 yuan. Due to exchange rates, it has declined. The current market price is 165 yuan. Qicai has also loosened simultaneously. Lion's mane vegetables are selling for 153 yuan, Western mushrooms are at 50 yuan, Wudun vegetables are at 49 yuan, and Longya vegetables are at 47 to 49 yuan. The overall trend seems to be gradually stabilizing.

### North-South Goods: Black Fungus Steady

Black fungus has become weak and tired again recently. Sichuan fungus has a listed price of 300 yuan, but buyers are few. Top brand You fungus is 295 yuan, and second-grade is 290 yuan to 280 yuan. It is found that there is not much sales, and it is difficult to turn around for the time being.

### Silk and Tea: Foreign Silk Mills Selling Off

There was no market in New York yesterday. Yokohama silk prices were weak. Spot prices opened at 1,520 yuan, down 5 yuan. The afternoon close was down another 5 yuan. Near term: 1,534 yuan, 1,512 yuan in the afternoon. Far term: 1,572 yuan, 1,548 yuan in the afternoon. Each was down 24 yuan.

In the local silk market, foreign sales of new silk continued to be sold off. White factory 7/8 grade price: 5,100-5,150 yuan. Transactions of Zhengfu brand Filature silk were at a price of 2,400-2,420 yuan. A total of more than 100 bales were traded. Market records: white factory increased by another 50 yuan, while Filature silk was relatively weak. 6 pieces of silk head were shipped to Hong Kong on the 28th, and 2 bales of silk yarn were shipped to Singapore.

Inland cocoon prices: Haining local variety: 220 yuan. In the Huzhou area, Filature silk is 130 yuan per 100 taels, slightly weaker than at the beginning of last week. In the Wuxi area, the official start of sales is expected to be in early June.

275 packages of rayon were shipped from Hong Kong on the Yusheng vessel. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Rochefort wharf for unloading. 1,058 pieces of tea were shipped from Hong Kong on the 27th. Also, 374 pieces of tea dregs were shipped to Hong Kong on the 27th, and 289 pieces of tea were shipped to Singapore on the 28th, and 49 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Wuxi Spring Silkworms Spinning Cocoons; Qing Households' Costs are Very High; Losses Are Expected

Wuxi silkworm news: Due to the suitable climate and good management, the silkworms are developing healthily. Now, the big households have been eating leaves for three or four days since their great molt, and the early households have already begun spinning cocoons. The number of silkworms raised by farmers has increased compared to last year, but due to the impact of the European war, the future of silk prices is bleak. The price of mulberry leaves is high, from 250 yuan to 270 or 280 yuan, while the yield of mulberry leaves is not high, and the price of leaves is expensive. The highest price for mulberry leaves in the northern region is 50 yuan for three dan. The southern region produces more leaves, but each dan is also 14 or 15 yuan. In areas such as the new town of Naxiang in the south, because the lack of leaves in previous years depended on the east and west Dongting mountains, this year, the number of silkworm raising households has also flourished, the source has been cut off and the price of leaves has soared from 40 yuan for three dan to 90 yuan for three dan. Because they are unable to buy, most silkworm raisers have abandoned the late silkworms. If cocoon prices cannot be raised, it is expected that this year's leaf-buying silkworm raisers will suffer losses. Yesterday (the 27th), the cocoon industry held a meeting of the industry in Sanhuang Street to discuss the opening price and the cocoon price limit. (Good)

### Piece Goods: Dragon Head Fine Cloth Rises and then Falls Again

The domestic cloth market gradually stabilized yesterday. The floating surplus from this month has already been sold off, and most of the industry has slowed down sales after prices have fallen a lot. Therefore, the market has remained stable and selling prices have stabilized. However, small-amount hand goods transactions are still cheaper than the market, by 50 cents to 1 yuan per piece. More than 200 pieces of bleached and dyed white goods were traded on this street. Wen Yong brokers traded more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth and colored cloth. Brokers from Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan and Nanyang lacked bulk transactions.

Actual sales of East cloth remain sluggish and it is unable to rise. The white goods market opened sharply in the morning with Dragon Head fine cloth, rising to 40.075 yuan at one point, before falling back to 39 yuan at the close. After-market trading was done at a high of 39.5 yuan. Orders for the next month opened at 42.5 yuan. The asking price for Junzi Serge is currently 1.04 yuan per yard. The futures market for June is quite tight, with the closing asking price at 1.15 yuan.

There were 350 pieces of piece goods exported to Hong Kong today, and 52 pieces were exported to Singapore.

### Coal: Coal Ball Prices Remain Unchanged

Regarding the price of coal balls, it has been widely rumored in the market recently that factory prices have fallen by another 6 yuan, but after the reporter inquired with the guild, it was found that this was not true. The price of coal balls has already fallen by three rounds in the middle of this month. With the current exchange rate stabilizing and costs remaining the same, it is impossible to fall again. In fact, it was caused by a newspaper incorrectly publishing news, which led to false rumors. According to investigations, the Yitaixing Nanyang coal ball guild still sells coal balls at 148 yuan per ton, with transportation added separately. However, although the listed price for shops on this street is 8 yuan, some are also selling for 7.8 to 7.9 yuan.

### Metals　Plain White Iron Firm

Recently, due to a lack of plain white iron arrivals and low factory production, standards remain firm. The current market price is around seven dollars and five cents per sheet for six-foot sheets, and eight dollars and fifty cents per sheet for seven-foot sheets, both showing an increase of twenty to thirty cents compared to before. Yesterday, the construction gangs on this street bought the most, exceeding a hundred bundles. Other gangs from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places also purchased nearly a hundred bundles. On the 27th, two hundred and fifty pieces of point copper and one hundred pieces of tinplate were shipped from Hong Kong.

Old News Rehashed: 67 Years Ago (397)

(See this newspaper from the twelfth year of Tongzhi in the Late Qing Dynasty)

### Renting a Wife

I have heard that in remote rural areas, there are names such as "renting a wife" or "curving a wife." I used to think it was an exaggeration, but I never imagined it would actually happen. On Saturday, at the French Concession Court, Chen San claimed: Originally from Jiangbei, he had rented his wife to Zhang Jiu, receiving an initial payment of twenty silver dollars. It was agreed through a mediator that the monthly rent would be one thousand five hundred copper coins, and a contract was drawn up, with each party holding a copy. Now, when he went to collect the rent from Zhang, not only was he not paid, but he was also threatened with physical violence. Therefore, he requested an investigation. The magistrate, upon hearing the testimony, was deeply surprised! He then addressed Zhang Jiu, saying that with such a cheap transaction, how could he refuse to pay the rent? Zhang Jiu claimed that Chen San was not starting the trouble over the rent, but because he still wanted to have relations with the woman, which led to the argument. Magistrate Sun then asked Chen San why he did not redeem his wife. Chen replied that he was struggling to eat, so where would he find the money to redeem his wife? The magistrate instructed them to go outside and resolve the matter through the mediator themselves.

### Crying for Help While Seeking Death

There are cases of people crying for help after being attacked, but it is unheard of for someone to seek help while trying to commit suicide. On the third day of the month in the afternoon, a person on the bank of the Dagou Bridge shouted for help, saying that if no one helped, he would jump into the river. A Chinese constable, number 145, brought him back and sent him to the authorities. According to his statement, he had become destitute after failing to find his relatives. Judge Chen, considering that he was crying for help while seeking death, found the situation unusual, but ultimately due to poverty. He ordered that the man be given five hundred large coins and instructed him to return to his hometown to close the case.

Education

### The Distress of Secondary School Teachers

— Shui Huo

Before the July 7th Incident, Ms. Chen Hengzhe issued an appeal to save secondary school students. She pointed out that the heavy workload of secondary school students' curriculum had caused adverse effects on their physical and mental well-being. Therefore, she had many worries about the future of secondary school education. Indeed, this is a major crisis facing secondary school education today. However, on the other hand, the teachers who are responsible for education in the isolated islands are facing an even greater crisis. The author would like to express the accumulated grievances for the thousands of secondary school teachers in the isolated islands, and hope that government leaders, school authorities, people from all walks of life, and secondary school students can pay attention to this issue and work together to help solve the distress of teachers.

Tenth, what we want to bring up is the poor environment. This is not an excuse to shirk our responsibility. In fact, the school buildings of most schools today are mostly makeshift, narrow and unbearable. The rooms are small and crowded, and ventilation and lighting are not paid attention to. Or, the classrooms of other schools are borrowed, which makes teaching even more inconvenient. School buildings in bustling areas or near the market are even more noisy all day long. In terms of teaching equipment, in addition to blackboards and chalk, there is an even greater lack. "A skilled woman cannot cook without rice." The impact on teaching efficiency is very significant.

Second, the treatment is meager. In isolated island secondary schools, classes are valued by the hour. If there are weekends or winter and summer vacations, then salaries are suspended for four hours. The remuneration per hour is mostly less than one yuan. Even only four or five jiao. This kind of method is really unreasonable. Because for every hour a secondary school teacher teaches, they must have more than two or three hours of preparation, such as preparing before class and correcting papers after class, which all take time. Nowadays, most students are often dissatisfied with teachers' book-style teaching, but this is also a necessary phenomenon under the current situation, because teachers do not have time to prepare. Some teachers inevitably worry about their livelihood due to the reduction of salaries and the rise in the cost of living, so they have no heart to teach. Teachers with more resources have to increase their hours to thirty or forty hours per week, or engage in other businesses, so they do not have time to prepare before class, and they do not have enough energy during class. Teachers and students suffer.

Third, respect for teachers is lacking. In today's school commercialization and factoryization, the status of teachers has not received attention. Although the mission they bear is very important. The position of ordinary teachers in schools is only that of a clerk or worker. And the academic atmosphere is arrogant, and there are even malicious forces destroying schools, causing teachers to lose their personality. The dignity of teachers is even more unbearable to ask. Since teachers are not respected by students, teaching and moral education will not achieve significant results.

Fourth, the level of students is too poor, making teaching unable to expand. The isolated island school authorities all regard students as cash cows. Often, without screening, they are arbitrarily inserted into grades. This is indeed a broad promotion of education, with no discrimination in teaching. However, class teaching should not have too many differences in level. Because doing so often results in catering to one at the expense of the other. And the result of declining scholarship is that the materials in the textbooks cannot suit their level, so teachers can speak earnestly, but listeners still feel unable to understand.

The ancients said: "A person's breath lies in being fond of being a teacher." Although we are unwilling to ridicule and satirize ourselves with this, we hope that everyone can understand the distress of the isolated island teachers today, and work together to improve it. Then, not only will secondary school teachers be fortunate, secondary school students will be fortunate, but the national education will be even more fortunate!

### When Spring Departs

— Xu Yi

The countryside is silent. In the silent countryside, there are not even stray dogs.

Bright red flowers bloom all over the countryside, like a village woman that no one knows, blooming and withering on their own, growing old from their youth. Sighing about their own lives, they wither away and let the wind carry them far away, falling down and being trampled by the cruel iron hooves.

The setting sun, blinking its eyes, lets out a sorrowful sigh, seeing the loneliness of the countryside, and remembering the scene of village girls snatching mulberry fruits under the green shade in the past, how can it not feel some melancholy?

The leaves tell each other about the rise and fall of the countryside. Now, there are no longer lovers talking under the trees, and there are no longer farmers plowing the fields with sweat, only the ancient pine trees always stand slanted, missing their old neighbors!

How quiet is the countryside after the calamity. The God of Spring quietly sends the flowers and plants to bloom, but they gradually wither.

Excitedly, the breeze blows from afar, bringing the news: "All the gods of nature, next spring, you will surely see a unique sight."

War

### The Realization of Parachute Troops

— Shi Tao

The Rise of Parachute Troops: As the saying goes, "The Flying General descends from the sky." Now, this saying has been realized with the rise of parachute troops. This type of surprise tactic first appeared in the Soviet Union. In September 1936, the Soviet Union held a rare large-scale parachute troop exercise. Only 150 parachute infantrymen participated in this exercise. They descended from six giant military aircraft onto the same airfield. In less than eight minutes, they had organized their ranks, each guarding their own positions. Military attachés from various embassies who observed the exercise at the time were shocked by this.

Before parachute troops descend, they must first conduct aerial reconnaissance to find strategic locations behind enemy lines with no resistance. Then, the parachute soldiers take advantage of the gap. Through multiple experiments by the Soviet parachute regiment, it was found that machine gun-type weapons could be safely deployed by parachute and transported to the ground. Even transporting field guns and tanks in the air was very simple. For example, in one practice exercise, 1,500 paratroopers brought 150 machine guns and eight field guns to the ground, along with ample ammunition.

The Advantages and Disadvantages of Parachute Tactics: After the Soviet Union made this type of troop formation public to the world, it made the following explanation: "The purpose of the parachute regiment is to carry out surprise attacks behind enemy lines. If a large number of soldiers land in enemy territory, they can disrupt the enemy's plans behind the lines. Moreover, during air raids, only a small number of paratroopers are sufficient to destroy enemy equipment such as telephones and electric lights in major cities." The Soviet authorities also pointed out its shortcomings, saying: "Soldiers relying on parachutes to land in enemy territory are in danger of being strafed by enemy machine guns. However, as long as an aircraft can release a thin smokescreen, this danger can be prevented. Parachute soldiers must not land in the center of enemy positions, because if there are superior enemy forces nearby, it will be disastrous."

Training Flying Generals in Major Powers: The Soviet Union places great trust in its parachute troops. It is the only country in the world that has developed them to such an extent. After being stimulated by the Soviet Union's public exercises, the United States was the first to engage in research. France, Italy, and Germany also adopted them successively in 1937 and 1938. As a result, the art of parachuting was carefully studied by military experts and aviation technicians from various countries. Specifically, regarding the progress of parachute regiments, the German Air Force established a parachute soldier school in Stendal, beginning organized training. It recruited a large number of young people aged seventeen to twenty-two for intensive training. However, the activities of the German parachute regiment were kept completely secret. The extent of its development was beyond the comprehension of outsiders. However, the German military authorities were certain that in the event of war, this parachute regiment would achieve amazing results. Judging from the recent war in Europe, this certainty was not unfounded. As for France, it also hired Soviet air force officers to conduct vigorous research. In June of the previous year, the Italian Air Force conducted exercises in the Libyan colony of Africa, deploying two battalions of engineers from the sky to quickly build an airfield. It also used large aircraft to transport two regiments of assault troops, and was also able to transport a large number of machine guns and several light field guns to the ground.

Paratrooper Activity in the Early Stages of the European War: When the German army invaded Poland, parachute troops immediately landed behind the Polish front lines, cutting off the Polish army's retreat and destroying bridges and other transportation infrastructure. On September 13th of last year, the United Press correspondent with the Polish army reported to the New York headquarters from a certain location in southern Poland via international telephone: "In order to disrupt the Polish rear, the German Air Force has organized parachute commando teams, secretly using parachutes to drop a large number of spies into Polish territory to scout out the locations of Polish troops, air bases, military supply factories, and other areas..."

Subsequently, when the Soviet Union attacked Finland, the Soviet army also used parachute troops in surprise attacks on the Kamennogorsk Isthmus front line, and deployed soldiers and spies behind the Mannerheim Line, which ultimately forced Finland to make concessions.

The threat of parachute troops will become increasingly serious due to the expansion of the European war. The development of parachute troops will also accelerate due to the intensity of the war.

Essay

### Big Birthday

— Liu Yueshen

The calendar told me: today is my birthday. And it is the so-called "big birthday every ten years," my twentieth.

When I got up in the morning, it was not yet six o'clock. The sun had just revealed half its face, the morning breeze was gently blowing, and the surrounding air was no different. Only my heartstrings went from being quiet to throbbing.

Ten years ago today, what a happy day! I embraced infinite hope and tried my best to enjoy this day. I "rightfully" took a day off from school, wore gorgeous new clothes, and ate endless cakes and candies. Guests filled the house, so lively and fun, it really made me feel happy. Turning my eyes, the calendar had its three thousand six hundred and fifty pages torn away; and now my big birthday is here again. In theory, it should be doubly joyful and doubly lively; but, in fact, it is the opposite. My hometown has become a ghost domain, my relatives and friends are scattered like stars and clouds, leaving only me, lonely and isolated, living on a deserted island, tasting loneliness and hardship.

My psychology has fundamentally changed. There is nothing to celebrate on my birthday, and I feel even more infinite sadness. Why? My age increases as time passes, my lifespan shortens as my age increases, and the burden on my shoulders becomes heavier day by day. For twenty years, I have lived a life like a stupid insect, without any achievement. I have let down society and the country, I have let down my loving mother, and I have let down myself even more. My heartstrings were violently vibrating, my face was red with shame, and my eyes were tearing with sorrow.

"Whoosh..." The factory whistle woke me up, and the past memories and past sorrows all disappeared without a trace. I quickly raised my hands, embraced reality and worked hard—work!

I have already given up twenty years of my youth, so let me grasp this present youth tightly!

### "I..."

— Luo Daoai

The New York Telephone Company has carefully studied conversations on the phone. They found that the word "I" is the most frequently used word on the phone. From the replies of five hundred telephone calls, they heard three thousand nine hundred and ninety "I" words.

According to a report by Wasserman, a student at Syracuse University in the United States, the person who uses the word "I" most frequently in speeches is German leader Hitler, who uses the word "I" once every fifty-three words. Next is Italy's Mussolini, who uses the word "I" once every eighty-three words. Other figures include US President Roosevelt, who uses the word "I" once every one hundred words; British Prime Minister Churchill, who uses the word "I" once every one hundred and sixty-nine words; former French Prime Minister Daladier, who uses the word "I" once every two hundred and thirty words; and former British Prime Minister Chamberlain, who uses the word "I" once every two hundred and forty-nine words.

Entertainment World

### The Palace of Art—Hollywood

— Hua Sheng

Hollywood—the film city where movie fans all over the world make beautiful dreams—is a small place that cannot be found on ordinary maps, yet it is the most famous place in the New World. California's reputation is surpassed by Hollywood, its glory is greater than its production of large quantities of wool.

Now almost every American wants to build a villa there. Indeed, Hollywood's material prosperity in recent decades is fascinating, not to mention the golden mountains and waters of California in the evening, which are so intoxicating! Even in Shanghai, we often hear people say: "If I have money, I must go to Hollywood for a trip."

We cannot deny that Hollywood's current status is the result of the combined hard work and money of countless people. We admire the hard work of their predecessors. We remember Mr. Samuel Irving, who grew up in California and had a great interest in film art. He can be said to be the first person who aspired to make Hollywood a filming location, but he never dreamed that Hollywood would stand at the highest peak of the world's film industry. The great achievement of a career requires struggle, and Hollywood's current status is by no means accidental.

Between 1914 and 1918, the chaos and terror in Europe made the Americans very rich. The wealthy countries became even wealthier. Since then, the Americans have been living a happy and stable life under the protection of the god of peace. They also came up with various forms of entertainment, and they became even more interested in the film industry. Therefore, Hollywood's rapid progress in film technology has surprised many other scientists.

### Jin Shaoshan's Troubles Never Come Singly

— Wei

After Jin Shaoshan went north, although he was able to overwhelm Hao (Shoushen) and Hou (Xirui) and become popular in Beijing and Tianjin, his temper remained eccentric, just like when he lived in Shanghai. Recently, the scandalous affairs that have occurred involving Jin have been widely rumored in the old capital. According to reports, Hu and Fan, two qin players, each had a daughter. They became apprentices of Jin the year before last. Jin held an apprenticeship ceremony at the Tonghe Xuan, inviting insiders and outsiders to observe the rite. Therefore, all circles in the old capital knew that Jin had accepted two female apprentices. Unexpectedly, one of the female apprentices was seduced by Jin this year and committed adultery with him. They engaged in serious negotiations. Jin was afraid that the matter would spread outside, so he asked people to intervene and was willing to spend three thousand taels of gold to settle it. This matter was finally settled. However, one wave subsides, and another wave rises. Another female apprentice was also heard to be six months pregnant. At that time, Jin said to others: "Since they are both apprentices, they should be treated equally. These girls were already blind when they worshiped me as their teacher. However, I will never let them suffer. I will give her three thousand taels as well." From his words, it seemed that he thought such things could be solved with money. Unexpectedly, the other female apprentice was unwilling to accept this and filed a lawsuit accusing him of seduction. On the day of the trial, Jin fled to Tianjin, and again asked people to run around and take care of the aftermath. As a result, it was resolved with the sum of six thousand taels. However, Jin was extremely short of money and planned to pay it in two installments. Although he has already paid three thousand taels, it was all borrowed. Recently, he has been singing his business operas more frequently, which is due to this. On the one hand, he urgently wants to make up for the deficit, and on the other hand, he still needs to raise three thousand taels to settle the case. Therefore, the Jin overlord has no choice but to pull out his throat and sing loudly in Beijing. (Previously, Shaoshan only performed once a week in Beijing, but now he performs every other day).

There is another matter that is also laughable. That is Jin's housing dispute. According to reports, the house on Panjiaheyan Street where Jin lives is owned by Li Yongli, the father of Li Wanchun. Yongli and Shaoshan are sworn brothers, so when Jin came to Beijing, he let Jin live in the house without paying rent. After Jin moved into the house, he made major renovations, such as installing floors, installing telephones, and adding sanitary ware, which cost him four or five thousand taels of gold. However, he never paid rent. The rent was one hundred and twenty yuan per month, which was not excessive, but because it had been owed for a long time, it amounted to several thousand yuan. Although Li Yongli repeatedly asked Jin for it, Jin turned a deaf ear. Li did not want to create resentment over this matter, as he had a sworn brotherhood with Jin, so he simply sold the house. Recently, the house has been bought by a Japanese person. Li thought that since the house had changed hands, Jin could move out. Unexpectedly, Jin has been delaying until now because he has not been able to find a suitable house. He would rather decorate the house for others than pay rent. Observers said that this is truly a wonderful person and a wonderful thing.

### Snippets from the Film World

— Xing

In order to pay tribute to the national flag and the portrait of the Premier, Chairman Lin, and Chairman Chiang, the China Film Studio has recently produced a large batch of five-color short films, which will be provided free of charge to theaters at home and abroad for screening.

Tian Han is skilled at writing lyrics. For example, the famous songs in the films "Peach and Plum Tribulation" and "Song at Midnight" were all written by him. Recently, someone recorded the theme song he wrote for the film "Great Victory in Northern Hunan," which reads: "A phoenix resurrected from the ashes, Changsha revived from the scorched earth, People tempered in suffering, have created the battleground's splendor!"

### Quick Notes on the "Student Concert"

— Zhang Peng

The Shanghai Conservatory of Music held its first student concert at the YMCA auditorium on the evening of the 25th. The proceeds from the tickets, after deducting all expenses, will be used for the construction of the conservatory. There were many performances, starting with a cello solo, followed by violin solos, duets, and trios, then soprano solos and tenor solos, and finally Zhu Yijun's piano solo "Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6." The melody was beautiful and rare.

What impressed me the most was the performance of pianist Zhu Gongyi, which can be said to have reached the pinnacle of perfection. When he played his piano solo, the high and low, ups and downs, and beautiful melodies floated in the space of the entire auditorium, captivating the audience. Here, I must introduce Zhu Gongyi to the readers of this publication. He is the son of the famous doctor Dr. Zhu Jifu, and he is only eighteen years old now, but his art has reached a state of perfection. It is expected that he will have great accomplishments in the future and become a talented pianist in China's music world.
