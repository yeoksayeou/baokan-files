### Main Force of Suiyuan Troops Advancing Towards Baotou; Japanese Reinforcements Attempt to Re-Invade Wuyuan; Fierce Fighting on Both Sides of the Wujia River

Chongqing: The Chinese Army spokesperson received reporters this afternoon and, reviewing the week's battle situation, stated that the situation in western Suiyuan is extraordinary. The main force of the Japanese army is launching a western offensive from Baotou, again attempting to seize Wuyuan, while the main force of the Chinese army is advancing from Wuyuan towards Baotou. Although the Japanese army may be able to occupy Wuyuan, according to the latest news received in Chongqing, the Japanese army is still ten miles away from the city's northeastern side.

Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, the Japanese army in Suiyuan is now making every effort to counterattack Wuyuan, so the re-capture of Wuyuan is possible. As of yesterday, the vanguard of the Japanese army had advanced to within ten miles of Wuyuan. Before the 25th, the Japanese army had also counterattacked Wuyuan, but its strength was obviously very weak. However, since then, the Japanese army has received reinforcements of 3,000 fresh troops, carrying twelve heavy artillery pieces and over 1,000 rubber boats, rushing to the Wujia River front. According to the spokesperson, although Wuyuan may be lost again, the Chinese army's victory on the 22nd, the battle to retake Wuyuan, is indeed commendable. In this battle, the number of Japanese officers (including political workers and special agents) annihilated reached 300, and the number captured alive reached 11. (28th Associated Press dispatch)

Fierce fighting is occurring everywhere between the Chinese and Japanese forces in the northeast and southeast regions of Wuyuan. The Chinese army is seizing the most advantageous initiative and will launch another large-scale annihilation battle. (28th dispatch)

### Ruling Class of Japan Deeply Knows that Military Force Cannot Conquer China - Commentary by the Soviet News - Chinese Morale Has Not Diminished in the Slightest - Japanese Political Conspiracies Are Bound to Fail

Chongqing: Moscow dispatch, The News recently commented on the Sino-Japanese War and included a detailed map, saying that after three years of experience, the ruling class of Japan deeply knows that military force cannot conquer China. In the initial stage of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army occupied a large amount of territory, important industrial centers, railway lines, and major ports due to its superior equipment, but it still failed to defeat the Chinese army or become the true master of the occupied areas. The Japanese side has also failed to destroy the unified solidarity of the Chinese people. For the past three months, the front lines in central China, southern China, and northern China have not changed, which shows the enormous losses in manpower and materials suffered by the Japanese army over the past two years and the high degree of anti-war sentiment within the Japanese army. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that the Japanese side is stepping up the establishment of puppet organizations. The Japanese side knows that it cannot win militarily, so it uses others to realize its ambitions, but this attempt is also bound to fail because the morale of the Chinese people has not diminished in the slightest and will not compromise until the Japanese army is completely driven out of the country. Any Japanese conspiracy will be difficult to achieve. (27th dispatch)

Editorial

### After Mr. Welles Returns to the United States

U.S. Under Secretary of State Mr. Welles was ordered to visit several European powers, meeting with the authorities of Italy, Germany, France, and England. He lingered in Rome, awaiting the return of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler from their talks. Then, after a long conversation with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, he set off for the United States. Last night's telegram stated that Mr. Welles arrived safely in New York yesterday and immediately proceeded to Washington. According to previous reports, U.S. President Roosevelt or Secretary of State Hull will make a statement to the world after listening to Mr. Welles' report. The actual scope of Mr. Welles' mission and the precise gains of his visits are unknown to outsiders due to the tight-lippedness of all parties involved. Therefore, what the U.S. President or Secretary of State intends to declare is, of course, beyond the scope of anyone's speculation. Nevertheless, what the world is eagerly awaiting in the next few days lies in this. We sincerely wonder how Mr. Roosevelt or Mr. Hull will reassure the world?

From the time of Mr. Welles' visits to European powers until his return to report, international phenomena have been complex and can be interpreted in various ways. Merely skimming the surface of a few phenomena makes it difficult to reach accurate conclusions. For example, in recent days, warring nations have everywhere expressed their determination to fight, actively engaging in various efforts without the slightest slackening, and have also demonstrated the sharpness of their struggle in the international political, diplomatic, and economic spheres. At the same time, the Finnish-Soviet war suddenly took a turn for the worse, leading to peace, and the warring European nations seemed to have some expectations in the military sphere but took no drastic action. This is a new dynamic. On the whole, it is a mixture of joy and sorrow, and it is impossible to lean towards either side. Therefore, it is difficult to say whether Mr. Welles' trip was a success or failure. We earnestly hope that Mr. Welles has had extraordinary gains, and that Mr. Roosevelt, acting decisively, can turn the tide, turning weapons into instruments of peace. Let the three groups of wars in the world be such that the Finnish-Soviet war erupted last and was resolved first, and the war between England, France, and Germany, which began before the Finnish-Soviet war, will be resolved after the Finnish-Soviet war, and then they will jointly plan for the stability of the Far East. The greatest contribution of the United States and the most rational procedure for resolving disputes should be nothing more than this. Perhaps not. If the United States, through Mr. Welles' trip, realizes that the intentions of both sides in the European war are vastly different and that circumstances prevent reconciliation, and that the time for mediation is not yet ripe, then what we earnestly hope that the U.S. President or Secretary of State will declare to the world is to clarify the crux of the European war and to reiterate the U.S. President's interpretation of international peace two weeks ago: namely, true, lasting, stable, just, and reasonable peace is the universal need of mankind and must be based on morality. Based on this interpretation, the intentions of both sides in the European war are measured. By this means, we can answer the universal question of mankind: Are the war between England, France, and Germany and the need for peace fundamentally incompatible? Do both sides agree that peace should be interpreted properly? Is one of the warring parties intentionally controlling or destroying the other party? We firmly believe that civilized peoples will give similar answers to these questions, and this is where the nature of the European war and the nature of the Far East war differ greatly. If the United States, based on Mr. Welles' report, confirms that this answer is not wrong, then although the time for mediating the European situation has not yet ripened, the possibility of mediating will inevitably exist in the long run. We earnestly hope that Mr. Welles' trip has not been in vain, that the European situation can be resolved rapidly due to the U.S. authorities' efforts to mediate based on Mr. Welles' report. If not, even if the implementation of mediation awaits the arrival of opportunity, how to urge both sides to gradually shorten the distance between their vastly different intentions is also an undeniable duty of the United States and something that the U.S. authorities are happy to strive for.

The United States is far away in the New World, standing outside the whirlpool of the current war. Solely because the interests of international politics, diplomacy, and economics are intertwined and closely related, the facts do not allow the United States to close its doors and isolate itself. Therefore, in the past, when three world wars coexisted, the United States devoted its efforts to three things separately. Now that the Finnish-Soviet war is over, and whether the time for mediating the European situation is ripe will also be determined by Mr. Welles' return. If it is ripe, then the United States will, of course, not be lax and will strive for the best possible outcome. If it is not ripe, then the United States will make preparations for mediating the European situation and take effective action to deal with the Far East as another matter. The nature of the Far East war is different from that of Europe; what Europe needs is mediation, what the Far East needs is to curb violence and suppress chaos. Mediation requires the belligerents to be willing to accept it, curbing violence and suppressing chaos does not require the consent of the violent and chaotic. Whether to wait for acceptance depends on whether the opportunity is ripe, there is no need for those who do not need consent to judge the strength and effectiveness of the power. In terms of military strength, the United States must know that it is a strong and unparalleled force, and the large-scale exercises of the navy and air force in the Pacific in the near future will prove the certainty of this strength through testing. Moreover, the United States does not need military force to curb violence and suppress chaos, but only needs determination; in addition, dealing with exhausted adversaries is like crushing dry weeds and rotten wood. In terms of economic strength, embargoes are an effective sanction, as evidenced by the anxiety expressed by Japan after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce, which frankly explained it.

Therefore, "English and American people traveling in Japan must learn Japanese, and we will hire translators." The newspaper expressed resentment that shop owners use English signs to make their businesses surpass other less educated shop owners. The newspaper attacked the welcoming of English-speaking people, saying that "the ugliness of England during the three years of the 'China Incident'" demonstrates the wickedness of the English. The newspaper claimed that using English signs does not benefit German and Italian people. Japan must give preferential treatment to German and Italian people, who are friendly to Japan in the fight against communism. To strive to eradicate English, the newspaper advocated abolishing English courses in girls' and middle schools. It argued that girls never use English after graduation, so there is no reason to teach them English for several hours each week. (United Press International, 28th)

### Japan and Spain Conclude Commercial Treaty

Paris It was believed here last night that the Japanese commercial delegation to Spain concluded a commercial treaty with Spain yesterday. The commercial delegation had been negotiating in Madrid for three weeks. It is widely believed that the contents of the treaty involve Japan transporting silk, rayon, velvet, and other chemical products worth 10,000,000 Spanish pesetas to Spain, including 1,000 bales of raw silk and 300 tons of rayon, in exchange for mercury, potassium, and industrial salt worth 14,000,000 Spanish pesetas from Spain.

### Tokyo Employees' Union Forced to Dissolve

Tokyo The "Tokyo Municipal Employees' Union" implemented its dissolution this week because the government adopted an anti-union attitude after the outbreak of the "China Incident." The union was established in 1924 with 2,000 members, mostly drivers and conductors of buses and streetcars. Three years ago, the union once went on strike for three months demanding increased wages for bus drivers and female ticket sellers, which almost cut off transportation in Tokyo. Eventually, the union won, with a total increase in wages reaching 1.3 million Japanese yen per year. That year, several leaders of the union were arrested due to the surge of nationalism in the country after the "Incident." Hashimoto, chairman of the union's executive committee, told reporters that the union was bowing to nationalism to adapt to the trend of the times. "After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, liberalism and capitalism seem to have declined, so the labor movement has also declared its end." (United Press International, 28th)

### Another Soviet Cargo Ship Detained by British in Far East; Escorted by British Navy for Inspection; Soviet Ambassador Maisky Visits British Foreign Secretary; Germany Purchases Raw Materials from Dutch East Indies

London It is now known that the Soviet cargo ship "Mayakovsky" is currently being detained in Hong Kong so that the Allied powers can inspect its cargo. It is reported that the ship loaded copper and copper from North America destined for Vladivostok. (Reuters, 28th)

Hong Kong The Soviet vessel "Mayakovsky," said to be detained in Hong Kong for inspection, as reported by London, does not appear to be in the area. According to the most reliable information available in Hong Kong, the ship was intercepted around March 15th in the North Pacific and escorted to an unknown destination for inspection, likely in Hong Kong or Hanoi. (Reuters, 28th)

London The diplomatic correspondent of The Times claims that Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday afternoon. This is the first time since relations between the two countries became strained after the Soviet invasion of Finland. All newspapers state that Maisky's visit is related to the detention of the Soviet ship "Mayakovsky," which was escorted to Hong Kong after being intercepted, and the detention of the Soviet ship "Salonga" in Hong Kong. The Soviet side stated that these ships are state-owned and should be treated differently from privately owned vessels. (Reuters, 28th)

London The Rotterdam correspondent of The Times claims that, according to a report in the Rotterdam Morning News from Surabaya, German representatives in the Dutch East Indies have recently purchased large quantities of rubber, coconuts, palm oil, kapok, and other raw materials, regardless of price. Business people in Surabaya expect that the German government intends to transport these goods to Vladivostok to break through the blockade. Several German ships currently docked in Surabaya are likely to be used for this purpose. It is also reported that Soviet personnel in the Near East are actively purchasing goods from the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters, 28th)

London The People's Voice newspaper carries an article by You Wei discussing the Hong Kong detention of the Soviet merchant ship "Mayakovsky," stating that the Soviet Ambassador to the UK previously protested to the British government about the detention of the Russian ship "Salonga," which was carrying a batch of tin, antimony and tungsten, and is now bound to protest again. However, the British issued orders to the Pacific Fleet to stop contraband goods en route from the United States via Vladivostok and the Siberian Railway to Germany. This is an action that Britain is entitled to take under the rights of belligerents, and this order is now being strictly enforced. Germany is forced to take the long route, which is time-consuming and expensive, to obtain supplies, and its predicament is evident. Now this route has been cut off again. The prevention of the Pacific route is now being strengthened and will soon achieve complete results. (Reuters, 28th)

London The detention of a Soviet ship by British authorities in Hong Kong is increasing friction between Britain and the Soviet Union. It is generally expected here that a large-scale naval and commercial war may arise from this on the vast Pacific Ocean. Although Britain is striving to strictly suppress the smuggling of contraband goods into the Far East in wartime, it does not want to break ties with the Soviet Union as a result. However, the Daily News claims that "the Navy is now trying to close Germany's backdoor in and out of Vladivostok." The report continued, "There are signs that the United States is circumventing the rules and engaging in private contraband trade with Germany. The goods are first loaded onto American ships and transported to Mexico, and then loaded onto Soviet ships from Mexico to Vladivostok, but this move will now be blocked." The London News further stated that the British Navy may be actively at war in the Pacific with German submarines escorting Soviet freighters. According to news obtained from Shanghai, Germany is negotiating with Japan to allow Germany to establish a base on Hainan Island, as the island is located at a key point on the British lifeline between Singapore and Hong Kong and is a strategically important base. The report also said that at least eighty German submarines were being transported to Vladivostok via the Siberian Railway and prepared to be assembled in Whaling Bay near Vladivostok. The Daily News also reprinted a report from the Melbourne Daily News in Australia, stating that the Soviet Union is deploying a tightly organized espionage network in Australia, which will greatly benefit Germany. In view of the above, the general public here believes that the top politicians of Britain and France will soon convene to promote strategies for the war. The Pacific issue and the issue of the United States supplying Germany will also be considered. (International Society, 28th)

The Hague Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky visited the British Foreign Office to negotiate the Hong Kong detention of the Soviet ships "Selega" and "Mayakovsky," stating to Foreign Secretary Halifax that these ships were owned by the Soviet Union and that the cargo on board was also being transported to the Soviet Union for consumption within the Soviet Union. It is claimed that Maisky demanded the immediate release of these ships and stated that the British government would be responsible for the losses incurred due to the detention. However, Halifax only promised to conduct an investigation and did not provide a firm guarantee. The "Selega" was carrying ore and tin from Manila to Vladivostok and was intercepted near Taiwan by two British cruisers and immediately escorted to Hong Kong. "Mayakovsky" was transporting 4,000 tons of copper from Mexico to Vladivostok and was intercepted by British warships in the Tsugaru Strait of Japan and escorted to Hong Kong. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

London Today's "Chronicle News" praised the British detention of Soviet ships suspected of carrying military supplies to Germany. The report stated that the British action of detaining the Soviet ship "Salenga" in Hong Kong and detaining the Soviet transport ship "Mayakovskiy" on March 15 constituted "news that the whole country wants to hear." (United Press International, 28th)

### Welles Returns to Washington to Report; Refuses to Criticize European Dignitaries

New York U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here today on the Italian mail ship "Conte di Savoia" and immediately transferred to Washington to report to President Roosevelt on the outcome of his inspection of Europe. (Havas, 28th)

Conte di Savoia Mail Ship U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles has prepared a report on his recent visit to major European cities and his talks with various European dignitaries. It is heard that he will arrive in New York at 9:00 a.m. this morning. After arriving in New York, he will immediately rush to Washington. On his return trip, he often communicated with the U.S. State Department by wireless telegraph. While on the ship, he had discussions with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Fishu regarding British and French military plans in the Near East, and he also spoke with Mr. Cole, former Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Spain. (United Press International, 28th)

New York Assistant Secretary of State Welles returned from Europe today to New York and took the train to Washington. When receiving visitors, Welles was amiable and taciturn. It is said that he has no plans to travel to Europe again and firmly refuses to comment on any of the dignitaries he met in Europe. (Reuters, 28th)

London According to a special dispatch from this area, the Brazilian newspaper Diário de Notícias commented on the possibility of a reorganization of the British Cabinet, saying that it would be more efficient and unified if the leaders of the Labour Party participated. (Reuters, 28th)

### Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki Observes Papal Audience; Talks with Italian Authorities Yield Two Results

Rome Pope Pius XII received Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki this morning for a duration of one and a half hours. The Hungarian ambassador to the Holy See was also present. After the meeting, Teleki introduced his daughter and entourage to the Pope. He then visited Cardinal Maglione, the Vatican Secretary of State. The Hungarian Embassy hosted a banquet for Teleki at noon and invited Maglione and President Roosevelt's representative to the Holy See, Dai Le, to accompany him. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

Rome Political figures claim that the visit of Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki to Italy to talk with Italian authorities has yielded two results: (1) Hungary has accepted Italy's advice and will not raise territorial demands against Romania during the current war. (2) Italy has assured Hungary that it will provide assistance in any circumstances. Foreign observers claim that Prime Minister Teleki made concessions on the first point in deference to Italy's orders. However, the main goal of the trip was to inquire about Italy's true intentions towards Hungary, and this goal has been achieved as desired. This can be seen from the official communiqué issued yesterday, as well as the comments published in the fascist newspapers. Italian journalist Gaida (known as Mussolini's mouthpiece) recently published an article in the semi-official "Italian Daily News" and commented, "Italy and Hungary are both determined to maintain peace in the Balkans and the Danube River Basin, but this does not mean that Hungary's territorial demands will be permanently abandoned for a satisfactory resolution, or that other issues in Southeast Europe can be forgotten. Mussolini knows very well that the idea of peace should be built on a foundation of public good." (Havas, 27th)

Budapest Hungarian Air Force Commander-in-Chief Colonel Halley departed from here yesterday for Rome, accompanied by staff officers from the army and air force, as well as Italian military attaché to Hungary, General Mattei. According to official announcements, Halley's visit is to visit Italian Undersecretary of Aviation Piccolo and also to represent Hungarian Regent Horthy in awarding Piccolo the Hungarian Grand Cross Medal. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

### Soviet Government Recalls Ambassador to France Suritz Due to Improper Telegram by Suritz

Paris Prime Minister Reynaud reported to the Cabinet yesterday that the Soviet Union had agreed to recall Ambassador to Paris Suritz at the request of France. He stated that Suritz was no longer a diplomatic representative because Suritz had sent a telegram to Moscow after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, in which he used the term "British and French war provocateurs." The telegram was sent in French and was therefore subject to inspection. A copy has now been sent to Moscow chargé d'affaires Beyed, instructing him to inform the Soviet Foreign Minister that Suritz's actions exceeded the bounds of diplomacy. It was recently announced that Prime Minister Reynaud will visit the capitals of various European countries to consult with the French ambassadors stationed there. He has already met with the French Ambassador to London, Corbin, and will meet with Ambassador Pance in Rome. Yesterday, Soviet sources in this area stated that the date of Suritz's return to Moscow had not yet been determined. After Suritz's return to his country, the Soviet Embassy in France will be managed by Chargé d'Affaires Krabi Visev. A French spokesman told the press, "The Suritz incident should be considered a personal matter concerning the ambassador himself, as Suritz has gone beyond the scope of etiquette." Recently, French Ambassador to Moscow Noah Province has been on sick leave since February, and Ambassador Cici, who is stationed in Moscow, has also returned to England for treatment for the same reason. Also yesterday, French police closely guarded the Soviet Embassy, and all people entering and leaving were interrogated, without exception, including embassy staff. (Taiwan Masses, 28th)

### Chamberlain Prepares to Reorganize Cabinet

London Well-informed sources in this area recently stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain will announce a reorganization of the Cabinet at the end of this week or the beginning of next week. However, this will not involve recruiting new talent, but only reassigning existing Cabinet members to different positions. (Havas, 27th)

London According to a special dispatch from this area, the Brazilian newspaper Diário de Notícias recently commented on the possibility of a reorganization of the British Cabinet, saying that greater efficiency and unity would be achieved if the leaders of the Labour Party participated. (Reuters, 28th)

### Italy Celebrates Air Force Anniversary

Rome Today marks the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Italian Air Force. All Italian military air bases held special flight demonstrations. Prime Minister Mussolini personally participated in the celebration in Rome. All of Italy's latest military aircraft were lined up in the airfield, and Mussolini personally awarded medals to air force officers who had repeatedly performed meritorious service, such as Minister of Aviation Mutti and Undersecretary General Piccolo. This morning, the Italian newspapers said that the spirit and technology of the Italian Air Force can look down on the world and are second to none. In the future, they should continue to improve and manufacture better aircraft. At present, all of Italy's materials and aircraft manufacturing industries can manufacture the latest aircraft. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)

### British Foreign Secretary Summons Near East Envoys

London According to responsible sources, Foreign Secretary Halifax has summoned the British Ambassador to Turkey, as well as the ministers to Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, to return to the country for consultations. They are expected to arrive in early April. At that time, the British Ambassador to Italy is expected to take a short vacation in London. (Reuters, 28th)

London The British government signed a financial agreement with Spain a few days ago, stipulating that the United Kingdom will provide a loan of £2 million to Spain at an interest rate of 4.5%, with the principal to be repaid in 20 years starting from June 30, 1942. (Havas, 27th)

### Hungary and Yugoslavia Negotiate Addendum to Commercial Treaty

Budapest A Hungarian economic delegation is scheduled to travel to the capital of Yugoslavia today to negotiate an addendum to the existing commercial treaty between the two countries. Economic figures in this area say that now that political relations between Yugoslavia and Hungary have improved, commercial relations are bound to be positively affected. (Havas, 27th)

### Anglo-French Control of Contraband in the Near East: American Newspaper Claims Victory

London - According to a special dispatch from here, the Washington Post reports that Britain and France have already achieved victory in the first phase of controlling contraband in the Near East, without encountering strong opposition from the Axis powers. The Allied powers now hold strategically important military locations in the Near East, communication lines, and economic resources, which is disadvantageous to Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. The Allied military strength in the Near East is gradually increasing. Britain has now expressed its opinion that if Romanian oil continues to be supplied to Germany, Britain will adopt stringent measures to prevent it. An American newspaper in Cleveland states that the Soviet Union cannot supply Germany with sufficient quantities of the three raw materials necessary for warfare: oil, vegetable oil, and manganese. Even if Stalin is confident that aiding Germany can expand Soviet political interests and is willing to seize what belongs to his own people to supply Germany, transportation is the biggest obstacle. The lack of Soviet railways and shipping will ultimately prevent Stalin from fulfilling his wishes. The New York Sun commented on the sinking of German ore-laden ships, saying that this is of great significance at this time. Britain's sinking of such ships is tantamount to opening fire during wartime to cut off the supply of materials necessary for German military operations. If Britain can close this line, Germany will be severely affected. If British submarines can operate deep in the Baltic Sea, the difficulty of Germany transporting ore will be impossible to resolve. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)

### French Minister of Merchant Marine's Broadcast Address

Paris - The Minister of Merchant Marine, Mr. Rivol, delivered a broadcast address this evening, stating that France has a total of 3 million tons of merchant ships. Since the start of the war, only 16 ships have been lost, and only two have been destroyed by the enemy while under escort by warships. Although the number of French merchant ships is considerable, it is still insufficient to transport all the supplies needed by the country during wartime. Fortunately, Britain can allocate its surplus merchant ships for France's use. The total number of merchant ships of the two countries accounts for one-third of the world's total, and the strength is undoubtedly immense. In addition, in order to meet wartime needs, France has to limit the import quantity of various non-essential goods, so as to use the merchant ships freed up for more beneficial transportation. In short, in addition to making every effort to facilitate overseas transportation, Britain and France are also implementing strict inspection measures against Germany. Up to now, these measures have achieved good results, and hundreds of thousands of tons of various goods (especially various ores) have been intercepted by British and French warships on their way to Germany.

### International Economic Peace Committee Convenes in the Netherlands

The Hague - Currently, one Briton, two Frenchmen, and three Germans have arrived here to attend the "Economic Peace Committee" organized by the International Chamber of Commerce.

### Intense Artillery Battles on the Western Front; Anglo-German Air Forces Clash Three Times; British Communiqué Claims Seven German Aircraft Shot Down, One Lost; One German Patrol Boat Sunk in the North Sea Area

Paris - Yesterday, German artillery units in the area east and west of the Saar and Vosges Rivers were more active than usual, concentrating fire at long range on French positions such as wooded areas. French artillery bombarded the German side fiercely. The two sides exchanged fire for some time with varying intensity. Both sides sent out patrols, clashing several times in "no man's land." (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)

Paris - The French military headquarters communiqué stated a short while ago that artillery units on both sides were active west of the Vosges River yesterday. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)

French Front - The British Air Ministry announced today that seven British aircraft and 31 German aircraft engaged in fierce fighting for about three hours over the Western Front. Five to seven German aircraft were shot down, while the British lost only one aircraft. Five or six German Messerschmitt fighters, possibly including one Dornier, were shot down by the British Air Force. (United Press dispatch on the 28th)

London - Reuter's correspondent stationed in France cabled that the British Air Force in France shot down at least five enemy aircraft yesterday. Two other enemy aircraft are also believed to have been shot down, while the British lost one fighter. During patrols by British Hurricane aircraft yesterday morning, afternoon, and evening, they encountered four different types of German aircraft, resulting in three aerial battles. The five aircraft shot down were reportedly all Messerschmitt models. Another Messerschmitt, a Dornier, is also believed to have been shot down. A British pilot, a New Zealander, only 21 years old, who had previously gained fame in the Air Force for shooting down three enemy aircraft, shot down two more Messerschmitt aircraft yesterday. However, he narrowly escaped disaster during the engagement, being hit in the leg by shrapnel. He limped back to base, recounting the battle to his comrades, saying that shortly after noon, he and the pilots of two other Hurricane aircraft engaged nine Messerschmitt enemy aircraft. He attacked one by one, and soon hit one aircraft, which caught fire and crashed. After a brief melee, he shot down another enemy aircraft. The sky was clear, and he turned his head to look around, only to see another enemy aircraft, which had been watching the battle, diving down towards him. He immediately heard a terrifying bang, the engine cover was shot off, and the fuselage had a large jagged hole. Gasoline and flames sprayed into the cockpit. He was shocked and lost consciousness, but quickly regained it. He then tried to get out of the aircraft, and after a long time, he untied the parachute cord, and floated down. He was dizzy and felt a cold air rushing towards his face. As he passed through a thick cloud layer, he almost thought he was entering heaven. He landed in the no man's land between the two armies, and staggered into the forest, hiding the parachute with weeds. A French captain, holding a pistol, ran towards him. Recognizing that he was British, he helped him return to the French lines. Two other Hurricane British aircraft each pursued an enemy aircraft. One, piloted by an officer, fiercely attacked the enemy aircraft, causing it to catch fire and crash. Another British aircraft, piloted by a soldier, returned and reported that the enemy aircraft he was chasing disappeared into the clouds. Air Force Commander Barratt sent a telegram congratulating the British aircraft pilots. The entire camp was excited when this telegram arrived. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)

Berlin - Responsible officials here recently declared that the news of the British Air Force's success, as reported by British news agencies and radio stations yesterday, is again inaccurate. According to the German military headquarters official report, one British and one French aircraft were shot down on the 26th of this month, and another British aircraft was shot down over Germany on the 27th. In the above two aerial battles, the German Air Force suffered no losses. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 28th)

London - The British Air Ministry stated that yesterday, while conducting reconnaissance over the North Sea, the British Air Force attacked and sank an enemy patrol boat. The German ship was drifting downstream in the eastern North Sea. The British aircraft dived to attack amidst intense anti-aircraft fire. There were four enemy ships in total, but the British aircraft only selected one of them as the target, dropping bombs on it. It was witnessed that the bombs exploded on the deck with a loud sound. Thick smoke and flames rose upwards. The British aircraft ascended into the clouds after dropping the bombs. When they reappeared, only three ships were visible, and only a patch of foamy water remained where the bombed German ship had been. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)

London - An aircraft was discovered over Hitler's airspace today. It is believed to be a German aircraft. British fighters scrambled to intercept it and issued an air raid alert. It is believed that the German aircraft did not drop any bombs. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)

### Finnish President's Speech: Continue Efforts for Reconstruction; Rumors of Authorization for Paasikivi to Conduct Economic Negotiations with the Soviet Union

Helsinki - Finnish President Kallio said in a speech to Parliament yesterday that although the Finnish people have suffered from the ravages of war, they will continue to work hard for the future. We are saddened by the disasters Finland has encountered, and we are grateful that the Finnish people understand their responsibilities. The independence of Finland, the loyalty of the Finnish people, and the army still exist today. All of these are cornerstones for us to continue building the future. The defensive capabilities of the Finnish army are now vastly different from what they were at the beginning of the war. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)

Helsinki - When Finnish Prime Minister Ryti took office, he declared that the main task of the new government is to begin promoting the peaceful reconstruction of the country. Our foreign policy will aim for peace and neutrality, and establish friendly and trusting relationships with all countries. The national defense construction of Finland will be based on the new situation and past experience. About one-eighth of our compatriots are unemployed and destitute, and they must be able to live and work in peace again. The government will promptly provide effective assistance, and the people must also determine their contributions according to the amount of accumulated capital. After this war, Finland lost about 10% of its resources, farmland, and industrial products. The cession of the Karelian Isthmus caused Finland to lose 17% of its national railway and even more of its roads. After the fall of the Saimaa Canal entrance, the inland losses were also destructive. Finland ceded several important ports, resulting in significant losses in foreign trade, and even domestic finance, currency, and purchasing power were hit hard. If we want to restore the losses suffered in the new territory, we must work diligently and tirelessly. Such as food production, forest reclamation, the establishment of new industries, the development of water conservancy projects, the improvement of water and land transportation, roads, and ports, and the restoration of international trade relations, are all essential tasks. (Haitong dispatch on the 18th)

Helsinki - Well-informed sources here pointed out that after the reorganization of the Finnish cabinet, three cabinet members were born in Sweden, namely Foreign Minister Witting, Interior Minister Born, and Social Minister Fagerholm. This fact has a significant impact on the policies of the Finnish government. Diplomatic circles believe that after Witting takes over as Foreign Minister, his foreign policy will be based on the foreign policies of the Scandinavian countries, and he will adjust the lineup of foreign envoys as much as possible. It has been generally decided to recall former Foreign Minister Oco, who is currently the ambassador to Sweden, and to authorize Paasikivi as a special representative to conduct economic negotiations with Moscow. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)

Helsinki - Marshal Mannerheim arrived here today. All Finnish cabinet members went to the station to welcome him. When Mannerheim passed through the streets, the people cheered enthusiastically to express their respect. When the Finnish President received Mannerheim, he introduced the new cabinet members.

### Finnish Troops Retreat to New Border, Foreigners Prohibited from Entering

Helsinki - After the demarcation of the new Soviet-Finnish border, Finnish troops have now retreated to the new border. During the Easter holidays, Finnish troops continued to carry out the withdrawal work without rest. Some old border areas are about 120 kilometers away from the new border. Because the ice and snow along the road have not yet melted, it is quite difficult for ordinary civilians to withdraw from the ceded areas to the new border. Due to the lack of supplies, the livestock they carried were slaughtered halfway. The number of people withdrawing from the ceded areas is about 450,000. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)

Helsinki - The Finnish Ministry of Interior, at the request of the Finnish Army General Headquarters, issued a decree prohibiting anyone from entering the new border. Foreigners who want to enter the new border must first obtain special permission from the police station. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)

### Belgium Strictly Adheres to Neutrality, Safeguards Economic Prosperity

Brussels - Belgian Senator Doerna gave a speech to Parliament, stating that the Belgian King announced a policy of neutrality on October 14, 1936. At present, Belgium is still following this foreign policy, because even strong countries are in danger of losing territory during warfare. Belgium is a small industrialized country with a dense population. Once war breaks out, it will inevitably suffer disaster. Therefore, Belgium's policy of neutrality is not due to fear, cowardice, or attempts to take advantage of the situation, but to maintain Belgium's economic prosperity. Military actions are enough to destroy national finances and private enterprises, and Belgium relies on export trade as the main source of national wealth. Doerna concluded that the Belgian people support the government's policy of strictly adhering to neutrality. (Haitong dispatch on the 28th)

### Britain Implements Control of Tea Trade

London - The Ministry of Supply recently announced that the government has taken all necessary measures to ensure that the supply of tea this year will not only not be scarce, but also be able to be exported to foreign countries. In the future, private manufacturers who want to purchase tea from foreign countries must obtain a permit from the government, because the government has already controlled the tea trade. In addition, the tea needed by Britain in the future should be purchased from various autonomous territories and domestic territories. The government has signed contracts with tea merchants from various parts of the empire, and the validity period is set for one year, that is, from January 1st to December 31st of this year. As for the price, the average price from 1936 to 1938 will be used as the standard. If costs increase due to the war, the government also intends to consider providing subsidies. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)

### Tin Prices Tend to Fall

London - The Manchester Guardian commented on the downward trend of tin prices, saying that the price of tin in US dollars is now cheaper than before the war. The tin production quota can now be reduced again to raise market prices. The temporary setback after the promulgation of the new foreign exchange regulations was expected. However, American buyers cannot stop buying tin for a long time simply because they have to pay a few more dollars, because most of the tin supply comes from British territories. The US tin inventory is indeed smaller than the current demand, indicating that consumers are now using their previous high-priced inventories and are unwilling to take advantage of the current low prices to replenish them. There is probably no other reason for this than the expectation of a reduction in future consumption. (Reuter's dispatch on the 17th)

### New York Foreign Exchange Market

New York - The exchange rate of the British pound is still weak today due to the scarcity of buyers. It opened at $3.54875 and closed at $3.49375. Yesterday's closing price was $3.535. Operators are still pessimistic about the foreign exchange market because the use of the British pound will be greatly reduced according to the new British control regulations.

### US Army Aircraft Supplied to Britain and France

Washington - During the House of Representatives meeting yesterday, Mr. Boling, to the Congress , the cracks of the US Army's aircraft for sale to the Allies are now clear. The President has approved a new policy of selling new types of American aircraft to the Allies immediately. In order to ensure that military secrets are not leaked and that the expansion of the US Air Force is not delayed, the Army Department is adjusting its policy on selling aircraft to foreign countries in all aspects. For example, it stipulates that aircraft drawings owned by the Army Department or its manufacturers shall not be transmitted overseas for imitation or assembly. He formulated this policy "without being forced or pressured by anyone." Senior officials of the Army also spoke, stating that with the current expansion of production facilities, the United States will be able to produce 30,000 to 40,000 aircraft per year after the end of this year. The House Military Affairs Committee has indirectly approved the government's policy of selling aircraft to foreign countries. Several aircraft manufacturers then met with government officials to discuss ways to expedite the processing of foreign aircraft orders. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)

### The Dutch Ship "Waterland" - Chinese Crewmembers Encountered a Sinking - Confirmed: Only One of Twenty-One Chinese Crewmembers Injured

The Hague dispatch: In the past half-year, as the European War has intensified again, the competition of feints has sought to determine victory on the seas. For example, in mid-February, Xue Yitulu, a waterman serving on the Dutch ship "Saluria," told people that his ship was fortunate to be carrying non-flammable asphalt. En route, it struck a mine, and the hull was breached. Fortunately, the compartments were isolated, and the engine remained intact, allowing it to travel for two days to reach a British port, and then another day to the Netherlands. This is one example. Looking at the thousands of Chinese sailors serving on merchant ships of neutral countries, the most vivid experience of explosions was the incident on February 18th of this year (1940).

At around 9 a.m. that morning, the Dutch ship "Waterland," which had set sail from Luotang the previous evening, was heading south towards Asia when it was suddenly bombed near the Xiezi Sandbar, about fifteen nautical miles northwest of Xiekuidao Island in the Dutch province of Haizhou. Its position was 51 degrees 45 minutes north latitude and 2 degrees 18 minutes east longitude. The ship was equipped with mine deflectors but was still bombed. Whether it was destroyed by a submarine's torpedo remains unconfirmed. It is said that the ship's cargo was divided into five holds. The engine room, located under the smokestack, was between the third and fourth holds. The fifth hold was bombed and ruptured, taking on water first. Of the four lifeboats on the ship, one remained intact after the explosion and was immediately launched. In the instant of the explosion, a loud noise came from the rear of the ship, with wooden splinters and iron scraps flying everywhere. Fortunately, all fifty-one people on board remained calm and did not panic, allowing them to board the lifeboat together. Among them, the firemen from Dongguan and Bao'an counties in Guangdong Province were awakened from their sleep in the rear of the fifth hold when the explosion occurred. Among the stokers on duty in the boiler room, the chief fireman, Shen Lai, suffered serious injuries, fracturing his lumbar vertebra near the surface of the skin, with jagged protrusions and swollen, festering muscles around it. Ye Xiang, Deng Lai, Yuan Sen, and Zhuang Zhonghua suffered minor injuries. The remaining sixteen people, including Li Cai, Lu Yao, Deng Zhu, Zhong Tian, Liang Jiu, Zhan Liang, Huang Sheng, Ye Zu, Qiu An, Yuan Qingyao, Lin Fu, Zhang Long, Chen Fa, Zhang Jin, Xie Pei, and Hu Jian, were unharmed and boarded another Dutch ship that came to rescue them, along with the Western crewmembers. However, as the lifeboat moved away from the "Waterland," it was small and carried many people, and the seawater barely cleared the top of the boat. Fortunately, a British plane arrived overhead to watch over them, sending reassuring signals until the rescue ship appeared on the horizon, and the crowd's anxiety was finally relieved. Finally, the captain of the "Waterland" and a few senior crewmembers, realizing that the ship was not sinking very quickly, returned to the original ship on the newly emptied lifeboat and struggled to climb back onto the deck to salvage documents and some important items. However, Cai and carbon monoxide gas gradually began to appear in the ship, so they dared not stay any longer. Later, they saw that the undamaged part of the original ship was also taking on water and was being towed close to the shore. By 12:45 p.m., the 4,537-ton cargo ship had completely sunk.

Afterward, the captain and all the crewmembers who were fortunate enough to be unharmed or not seriously injured were taken by the rescue ship to Mu Chuan Gate, west of Luotang City, to disembark and return to Luotang by car. Among the twenty-one Chinese sailors, only Shen Lai remained in the "Holy Education Shuo Hospital" in Feixing Port, Haizhou, Netherlands. The four who were slightly injured returned to Luotang for treatment at the Sailors' Hospital. The loss of clothing due to the accident was reported to Consul Feng in Apbu by the Luotang Overseas Chinese Association, and negotiations were made with the company. At the same time, the Luotang Overseas Chinese Association, signed by Zhou Gui, who was also the secretary, sent a letter of condolence to Shen Lai, who was hospitalized for treatment.

Since the beginning of the war, the most distressing incident was on March 18th. Before dawn that day, two British ships collided in the sea off Ireland because they were traveling at high speed with their lights off to avoid enemy aircraft. One of the ships sank within three minutes, which was truly a tragedy. In that critical moment, the chief officer, Xi Lai, hurriedly grabbed a plank and jumped into the sea, while the other crewmembers struggled to cling to it. Gao Lai sang loudly, remaining calm in the face of danger to dispel fear. It was also heard that Bi Lai, an old sailor who had been working on ships for 31 years and could not swim, had twice experienced the danger of torpedo explosions and survived. In this incident, liquid rubber spilled onto the sea, rendering swimming skills useless. Bi Lai groped in the darkness and fell from the deck into the cabin. Thinking he had no hope of escape, he unexpectedly found a plank. As the ship tilted and sank, he was thrown out of the ship. Because he had the plank, he was calmly rescued. These are all experiences of escaping danger that travelers should remember.

### Serious Food Situation in Fujian Province - Each Stone Has Risen to Ninety-Two Yuan - Provincial Government Has Stipulated Corrective Measures

Fuzhou dispatch: Food prices in Fujian Province have been rising in recent months, exceeding the general price index in various places, which is unreasonable. In order to correct this, the provincial government has stipulated three measures and ordered all counties to comply with them. They are listed below: (1) Stipulate the prices of rice, wheat, and barley. All prices will temporarily be based on the local market price on February 20 of this year as the maximum and may not rise further. First, stabilize the market price, and then seek reasonable price reductions. If farmers and merchants hoard and speculate on the basis of this restriction, the local government should force the sale of their registered grain reserves. Violators will have their grain confiscated and will be punished according to law. The wholesale and retail prices of rice, wheat flour, potatoes, and other commodities in the market will not be evaluated, but the local government will restrict the profits of merchants at all levels to no more than 10%. The standard of restriction will be announced by the local government to ensure that sources with different costs can be concentrated in the market without obstruction. If the profit exceeds the limit, the offender will be punished according to law. The above is the initial decision of the government to stabilize food prices. (2) Because local authorities in rice-producing areas and rice-deficient areas often cannot take care of each other due to different circumstances regarding food matters, the responsibility of local authorities in rice-deficient areas is to first collect and sell local surplus grain to the market. If the amount is insufficient, grain merchants will be ordered to transport grain from outside. Strictly supervise the responsibility of local authorities in rice-producing areas to be fully responsible for supplying rice-deficient areas, not only to assist in purchasing but also to assist in transportation. In the future, the provincial government will designate a certain county to supply the grain shortage of a certain county according to local sales habits, current situation, and necessary changes. If there is any attempt to shirk responsibility or the supply is not coordinated, the responsibility will be discussed according to the above division of responsibilities. The district sales method has been implemented since March 11. Each county will telegraph the provincial government the minimum quantity that must be transported in or may be exported each month for reference. (3) It was decided to announce on March 20 the measures to crack down on food hoarding and speculation. If merchants and farmers have purchased, stored, and harvested grain that has not been registered or has been registered incorrectly, in addition to confiscating all undeclared or underreported grain, a fine equal to the value of the hoarded grain will be imposed. Those with a large quantity will be sent to military judicial organs for punishment. Fearing that ignorant villagers may mistakenly violate the law, the provincial government has ordered all counties to inform the people of the county of the registration before the promulgation of the measures to crack down on hoarding. Those who have registered incorrectly or have not registered are allowed to voluntarily apply for supplementary registration before March 20. If they delay any further, they will be punished according to the law and will not be tolerated. The county governments are instructed to explain to the people that the government's intention of registering grain reserves is purely to understand the surplus and shortage of grain in various places in order to make overall arrangements. After the provincial government issued the above three measures, the price of rice in Minhou, Lianjiang, Changle, Luoyuan, and other counties belonging to Fuzhou has fallen from 45 yuan to 40 yuan per stone (100 catties), and the price of grain has also fallen from 22 yuan to 20 yuan per stone.

Another report: The price of rice in Fuzhou City has recently risen to 92 yuan per stone because Wang Meihui, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Cao Xiaosan, Pan Yaosheng, Chen Dengying, Xue Kexiang, Xu Gaoren, Huang Yifei, Zheng Zhong, Wang Tiru, Wang Guchen, Dong Lesan, Guan Deyu, and others jointly formed a rice industry consortium to manipulate grain. They blocked rice boats from the outside, not allowing free trading, and hoarded and speculated on the inside, sharing the spoils and getting rich. As a result, the common people could not bear the hunger, and there were daily reports of people committing suicide by jumping into the river, taking poison, or hanging themselves. This is truly a serious problem in Fujian Province.

### Trees on Qizishan (Seven Sons Mountain) in Suzhou Are Almost Completely Cut Down - Affected by High Price of Firewood

Suzhou dispatch: Qizishan Township, outside Xumen in Suzhou, has always been a cemetery area. There are no fewer than five or six thousand tombs in the vicinity, including the ancient tombs of former sages related to local history. The area was once lush with pine and cypress trees and had beautiful scenery. Recently, due to the high price of firewood, all the trees have been cut down by ignorant people.

### Japanese Army Forcibly Builds Highway in Southeastern Jiangyin - Purpose Is for Transportation

Jiangyin dispatch: Since the Japanese army took control of the Yangtze River shipping industry in the ten townships southeast of Chengyi, Huayangjun Town, the port of Shiyiwei has become a hub for goods, on par with Hupu. For the convenience of transportation, the Japanese army has recently been forcibly recruiting farmers in the Yangjun area, paying four jiao for skilled labor and two jiao for unskilled labor, to build a highway from Yangjun to Shiyiwei Port. The route passes through Donglai Town, demolishing shops along the dyke, leaving many people homeless. The highway construction plan intends to include major towns in the vicinity, such as Fushan Luyuan, Xinzhuang, Masi Bridge, Futian Town, Shierwei Port, and Huashu, connecting them to the mouth of the Yangtze River and linking them to the existing Yangjian Fushan Highway and Chengxi Highway. The purpose is nothing more than to achieve their goal of exploitation.

### Ding Zihuan, Head of the Puppet Autonomous Association of Dinghai, Was Assassinated - Mortally Wounded by Clubbing on the Head

Dinghai dispatch: Ding Zicheng, the head of the puppet autonomous committee of this county, was a respected member of the community, a successful candidate in the late Qing imperial examinations, and once served as the magistrate of En'an County, Yunnan. After the Republic of China was established, he served as the first magistrate of Dinghai County. Because he always decided cases quickly, people called him "Seventh Master." However, he was cunning and resourceful, and he was even more skilled at exploiting the people. The people of the county hated him very much. Even his second son, Songsheng, strongly opposed his actions and once broke off the father-son relationship, which shows that he was despised by everyone. Later, because of his old age, he lived in seclusion at home and did not ask about worldly affairs, so many people hoped that he could maintain his integrity in his later years. However, when Dinghai fell last summer, Ding, despite his advanced age, was shameless and took up a puppet position, resuming his means of exploiting the people to enrich himself. At about 9 p.m. the other day, Ding was walking back to his residence from the puppet office when two strong men suddenly jumped out of the darkness and struck Ding's head with clubs as he passed through Shuaiqi Lane. Ding was caught off guard and, because he was over seventy years old, immediately fell to the ground with a bleeding head. His injuries were so serious that he died on the spot. The two strong men then calmly fled. Afterward, Ding's followers reported to the Japanese puppets, and the Japanese army imposed martial law and conducted a thorough search, but found nothing.

### Schools Lower Flags Today - Solemnly Commemorating Revolutionary Martyrs - Holiday for One Day in Accordance with Ministry of Education Regulations

Today is the 31st anniversary of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. At the same time, we commemorate Deng Shengyuan, Hu Zhantang, Chen Yingshi, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and Huang Keqiang. All levels of schools in this city will, as usual, take a holiday for one day and lower the flags to mourn. In this special situation, a large-scale memorial service cannot be held. Each school will separately convene teachers and students to describe the great achievements of the martyrs. We should inherit the legacy of the martyrs and rescue the country from danger. Recently, news of victories has been frequently reported from the western Sui and southern Guangxi battlefields. The people of Shanghai are doubly excited. Our colleagues in the education field should firmly support the national policy and complete the great cause of winning the war of resistance and building the nation. In accordance with the Ministry of Education's academic regulations, all levels of schools in this city will have a spring vacation for one week from April 1 to April 8, when classes will resume as usual.

The Educational Association Encourages the City's Educators

The Shanghai Educational Association issued a letter encouraging the city's educators, saying, "As we encounter this grand and solemn Martyrs' Revolutionary Memorial Day, we feel doubly saddened and grieved. Our colleagues in the education field must not merely comply with regulations and take a day off, thinking that is enough. We must have a thorough understanding of this tragic event, glorious history, and valuable lessons, and we must have an effective expression so that we may not fail this program on this, the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. (1) After the Prime Minister advocated the revolution, he launched several uprisings, all of which failed. Among them, the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs in the Huanghuagang battle was the greatest sacrifice, and its impact on the success of the Xinhai Revolution was also the greatest. From this, we can know that failure is a necessary stage before success in anything, and the more times we fail, the more hope we have of success. The greater the achievement of sacrifice, the more confidence we have in victory. That is to say, in whatever we do, we must first have a firm and unyielding ambition, recognize our own doctrine, and adhere to our own position, not being discouraged by failure or compromising halfway because of sacrifice. Success is what everyone desires, but if we cannot succeed, we should have the courage and determination to die for our cause. This is why the seventy-two martyrs will be remembered forever and admired by later generations. (2) The Battle of Huanghuagang was a manifestation of the great unity of the Qing Dynasty's revolutionary comrades, with the entire party's manpower and financial resources united as one. Although it did not succeed at the time, this tragic and enthusiastic spirit of sacrifice was enough to shock heaven and earth and deeply impress the Manchu Qing government. Fear and chaos spread, and the Manchu Qing government was so afraid of revolutionaries. Therefore, after the Battle of Huanghuagang, even if the revolutionary army had only one soldier, it could defeat the Manchu Qing government's million-strong army. The victory of the Xinhai Revolution was not due to the strength of the revolutionary army, nor was it due to the laxity of the Qing government's defenses. The main factor was the spirit of great unity among the revolutionary comrades. This is another significance of our remembrance of the martyrs. Today, we are fighting the war of resistance on the one hand and working hard to eradicate traitors on the other. The situation is worse than at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and the responsibility is greater than that of the martyrs. We should emulate the martyrs' spirit of fearlessness and take it as a banner. We should emulate the martyrs' actions of great unity and take them as a warning. We should also take this opportunity to instill the glorious history of the martyrs in students and make them thoroughly understand that achieving success and achieving ren are one and the same thing. Having the perseverance to achieve ren is the only way to achieve success. Without the courage to achieve ren, it is just a matter of luck, which will not only fail to achieve success but will also lead to debt. Traitors are willing to bet everything on the nation and the country, which is because they do not understand the relationship between achieving success and achieving ren. I hope that the entire education community in our city will accept this valuable lesson with sincerity and express it in action, achieve the goal of eliminating traitors and eradicating violence, and complete the mission of resisting Japan and building the nation."

### Financial - US Dollar Nears Six Yuan Mark - Bulls Aggressively Buy 300,000 Yuan - Sterling Soars Yesterday

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in listed exchange rates. The unofficial sterling-dollar exchange rate trended sideways, showing signs of recovery. However, due to the exchange rate decline, the market was mixed, with periods of tightness and looseness. The US dollar exchange rate, initially expected to rise, continued to fall by 1/8 of a cent, resulting in a situation where the central rate remained flat while the US dollar tightened. The rates were 4/1/8 of a cent and 6.03125 yuan, respectively. Nevertheless, the general expectation for the US and sterling exchange rates today is still bullish. Chinese merchants and speculators, seeking to profit, aggressively bought over 50,000 pounds of sterling and sold over 200,000 yuan of US dollars. Soon, Hong Kong also sold, and foreign banks like HSBC showed weak appetite, suddenly turning hard. Around 11 a.m., sterling reached 4/1/7/8125 of a cent, and the US dollar reached 6.01875 yuan. By midday, selling pressure eased slightly, and the situation stabilized somewhat. In the early afternoon, there was continued selling from Hong Kong and speculators, still showing a loose trend. Later, with gold prices rebounding, sellers hesitated, and the Bank of Japan unexpectedly bought slightly, causing the market to tighten again. By closing, sterling was at 4/1/5/625 of a cent, and the US dollar was only at 6.009375 yuan. As a result, sterling rose by 0.03125 compared to the previous day, while the US dollar contracted by 0.0625. The potential trend of futures was slightly converging with the spot market.

Midday Potential Trend Turns Loose

Early morning saw London's rates for near and distant futures rise by 1/8 of a cent each. New York silver prices remained flat, and London raw gold was stable. Exchange rates for sterling against the US dollar, Shanghai, France, and other currencies were all flat. The US dollar fell by 1/8 of a cent against sterling, decreased by 1 dime against Hong Kong, and slightly by 2/8 of a cent against France. Central listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling rates of 4/1/8 of a cent for sterling and 6.03125 yuan for the US dollar, with sterling flat and the US dollar tightening by 1/8 of a cent compared to the previous close, due to the continued decline in exchange rates. After opening, speculators initially sold into the market, causing the market to harden immediately. It was reported that Chinese merchants sold US dollars for 6.0625 yuan and sterling for 4/1/8 of a cent to foreign banks for the current month. At that time, the spot prices had risen to 4/1/40625 of a cent and 6.09375 yuan. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax rose by 1 cent. Afterwards, the public remained bullish on exchange rates, and speculators re-emerged, especially with the US dollar. The potential trend continued to loosen and harden. It was reported that speculators sold US dollars for 6.125 yuan for the current month and US dollars for 5.90625 and 9375 yuan for the following month to Chase and other banks. Subsequently, Hong Kong also suddenly came to sell, and HSBC's appetite was weak, further loosening the market. It was reported that Hong Kong sold sterling for 4/1/5/625 of a cent and US dollars for 6.01875 yuan in the spot market to HSBC and other foreign banks, which could be settled at one point. At the same time, spot sterling also hardened to 4/1/71875 of a cent. After 11 a.m., sellers gradually decreased, and the situation gradually stabilized. Only speculators continued to sell US dollars for 6 yuan for the following month to foreign banks.

### Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs Today; Shanghai Vows Loyalty to the People's Welfare in Renewed Struggle; City Halves Flags and Suspends Entertainment and Banquets; Various Parties Issue Declarations Offering Mutual Encouragement

Today is the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day, also the anniversary of the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. Various circles in this city, in accordance with the methods agreed upon by various public organizations and the concession authorities, uniformly fly flags at half-mast to express condolences and voluntarily suspend entertainment and banquets to show their grief. Schools and the Jianghai Customs also observe holidays as usual. At the same time, the martyrdoms of Deng Zhongyuan, Chen Yingshi, Liao Zhongkai, and Zhu Zhixin, as well as the deaths of Huang Keqiang and Hu Zhantang, are also commemorated. All circles have resolved to emulate the heroic, struggling, and unyielding spirit of the martyrs, strengthen their convictions, support national policies, complete the great task of resisting aggression and national reconstruction, and continue to promote the frugal national salvation movement to relieve the suffering compatriots. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Half-Mast and Holiday: Solemn Commemoration

March 29th is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. Because it is an extraordinary time, the central government has specially stipulated that the memorial days of Deng Zhongyuan's martyrdom on March 23rd, Hu Hanmin's death on May 12th, Chen Yingshi's martyrdom on May 18th, Liao Zhongkai's martyrdom on August 20th, Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom on September 21st, and Huang Keqiang's death on October 31st be combined and held on March 29th, and renamed the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day. All circles in this city remember the difficulties of the martyrs in establishing the Party and the country. At this time of the war of resistance, when the rivers and mountains change color, remembering the sages, especially deep sorrow. In order to express condolences and admiration for the great achievements of the martyrs, the whole city will fly flags at half-mast today and automatically suspend entertainment banquets. Courts, customs, post offices, schools, factories, and various associations will also have a day off. In order to support the national policy of resisting aggression and to promote frugal national salvation and national spiritual mobilization, we will complete the great task of resisting aggression and national reconstruction.

City Party Headquarters Issues Letter to the Citizens

The Shanghai City Party Headquarters, in memory of the revolutionary martyrs, issued a letter to the citizens, saying, "Today is the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day. It has been twenty-nine years. The martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed their lives, regarding death as going home. This great sacrifice and immortal spirit influences the psychology of the people, awakens the awareness of compatriots across the country, and influences the actions of the people, inspiring the struggle of compatriots across the country. Finally, it laid the foundation for the Wuchang Uprising. Today, when we hold the commemoration, everyone should think about how to continue to work hard to comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven. What did the martyrs follow the late Premier in devoting themselves to the National Revolution for? This has been clearly instructed to us in the Premier's will. Its purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China. Since July 7th, the Japanese have used aircraft and artillery to advance their so-called continental policy, trying to suppress our hoped-for freedom and destroy our expected equality. Then we must rise up to resist aggression in order to achieve the goal of the National Revolution. This resolution to resist aggression, everyone knows, is a long-term resistance. Naturally, we cannot wait until the victory of the war of resistance before building the country, because the purpose of building the country is also to seek freedom and equality for China. Victory in the war of resistance and success in building the country will inevitably lead to the attainment of freedom and the realization of equality. Therefore, our support for the national policy of resisting aggression and building the country is a practical point that should be done in the voice of commemorating the martyrs. The process of resisting aggression has entered the stage of victory, and the program of building the country has reached the time of success. Some people have betrayed from the ranks of resisting aggression and national construction, insulting the Premier's will and distorting the true meaning of peace, and destroying China's freedom and equality themselves. Therefore, our launching of the anti-traitor movement is another practical point that should be worked hard in the voice of commemorating the martyrs. Compatriots, we support the central government, we obey the President, resisting aggression and building the country on one hand, and eliminating traitors on the other hand. The martyrs are smiling, watching, waiting, waiting for the early arrival of freedom and equality in China."

Shanghai Memorial Service: Various Parties Send Condolences

Chongqing, 28th - On the 29th, the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day, the Shanghai Lone Army Camp will also hold a memorial service on the same day to commemorate the 811 martyrs who died in the Four-Line Warehouse battle and Battalion Commander Yang who died of overwork. All the important figures in the central government deeply commend the past glory of the Lone Army Camp. Chairman Lin has decided to send condolences to Shanghai. Chairman Lin inscribed "Gan Cheng for the Country," Chairman Chiang Kai-shek "Make My Great Wall," and He Yingqin "Fulfill Responsibility and Defend the Territory." The Central Executive Committee jointly wrote "Being Mountains and Rivers on Earth, Being Sun and Stars in Heaven, Taking Righteousness to Achieve Benevolence After Wars," "Good at Forging Spears and Shields, Good at Practicing Armor, Martyr Flag Guards the Country for Thousands of Autumns." Wu Kaixian jointly wrote "Born as a Hero, Died as a Spirit, Taking Righteousness to Achieve Benevolence, the Revolution Is Passed Down by Seventy-Two Warriors," "Merit in the Country, Martyrdom in the Party, Admiring Merit and Repaying Virtue, Leaving Fragrance to Watch for Thousands of Autumns."

Youth Organizations Urge Citizens

The Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League issued a declaration in memory of the martyrs, encouraging citizens to work hard, save the country, support the central government, and strengthen their belief that the war of resistance will surely be won and the country will surely be built, so as to complete the great task of resisting aggression and national reconstruction, recover lost ground, and glorify China as soon as possible. The Lide Friendship Association encouraged the citizens, saying, "At this time of commemorating the revolutionary martyrs, we should, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, emulate the spirit of the martyrs who devoted themselves to the revolution and regarded death as going home, eliminate the evil-doers, and eliminate the good for the country." Shanghai Loyalty Society's announcement to citizens said, "Fellow compatriots, today is the anniversary of the death of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. Recalling the enthusiasm of the compatriots' revolutionary sentiments and the spirit of generously sacrificing themselves at that time, it really evokes our infinite emotions. Our China, since interacting with foreign countries, has seen a decline in all aspects of culture, military, and politics. The great powers see our weaknesses, so there are always oppressions in negotiations. If we open the history of the late Qing Dynasty, which one is not a fact of our country and nation being invaded and oppressed by foreign nations? The Manchu Qing government still did not think about reforming and strengthening itself to consolidate the foundation of the country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was born at the right time and deeply knew that the country could not be revitalized without overthrowing the Manchu Qing Dynasty, so he called on comrades to carry out the revolution with the goals of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. Although it went through ten failures, the Wuchang Uprising received a response from the masses, and the Manchu Qing government was half overthrown. The deep penetration of national concepts and national consciousness among the people was really promoted by the great power of the revolutionary patriots at that time. Therefore, the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs led to the Wuchang Uprising, and the Wuchang Uprising led to a response across the country. How can we not deeply express our respect for the achievements of the sages? However, compatriots, now our country is suffering from external oppression, even more than in the past. The responsibilities we can bear are also even greater than in the past. Please see how the enemy has painstakingly planned for years, and how their current conspiracies and tricks are. We must not just express our respect. We must use our blood to do it, to continue the spirit of the sages, to eliminate national traitors internally, to resist the strong externally, and to recover our lost land, creating an independent and complete country. This is how we commemorate the Seventy-Two Martyrs and also do not forget our Premier."

Points of Propaganda for the Integrity and Shame Movement

The Integrity and Shame Movement Committee of all circles in this city telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the soldiers at the front to congratulate them on the victory, and paid their respects. At the same time, they announced to all circles, districts, and industries that the regiment members would be dispatched to carry out propaganda to the citizens in accordance with the propaganda points for the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial prepared by the committee in advance, urging citizens to stick to their posts, and writing various eye-catching slogans, which were posted on telephone poles and walls on various roads, such as: (1) People with ambition and enthusiasm should know integrity and shame; (2) Do you accept shameless money? (3) Are you participating in a shameless cause? (4) You have gone astray and embarked on the road of shamelessness, quickly repent and return; (5) We must promote integrity and shame, and we must have a spirit that is not threatened or tempted by profit; (6) We must temper our aspirations, promote the integrity and shame movement, and save China's peril; (7) We must develop the virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame to enrich our spiritual national defense, etc.

Concession Authorities Are Closely Guarded

The police authorities of the British and French concessions, because today is the Revolutionary Martyrs' Day, sincerely fear that bad elements will take the opportunity to disrupt public order, so they decided to implement emergency precautions from 5:00 this morning. In addition to prohibiting illegal gatherings and parades, posts have been increased on various roads and transportation routes, and car patrol teams and search teams have been dispatched to patrol in various districts. Anyone with suspicious behavior of pedestrians and vehicles will be inspected. In addition, the defense forces stationed in Shanghai and the International Settlement Volunteers are also mobilized to assist the police authorities in maintaining order to ensure the safety of the area.

### Increased Source: Rice Prices Turn Down

The entire rice market in Shanghai City has been manipulated by speculators, holding the spot goods, so that the market price has tended to rise again. Yesterday, after the rice shop tea party market opened at 9:00, people's hearts were weak, big households had no intention of continuing to enter, and small households also showed a wait-and-see attitude. The number of spot goods increased, and the market price fell back. As a result, it fell by about one yuan, and the source of rice and grain also arrived at the port one after another. Yesterday, it was estimated that more than 3,000 bags of domestic rice were transported by wheels, and 38,000 bags of foreign rice were transported by the Sazhe wheel managed by the Zha Hua Company from Yangon. Due to the gradual shrinking of rice prices, restaurants, taverns, package meal shops, and dim sum shops have all reduced prices one after another, and the general public is celebrating. However, the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills continue to supply fair-priced flour, and the price insists on the number of 13 yuan per bag, and the bureau continues to negotiate. According to the general opinion of the public, it is believed that the problem of people's food cannot be delayed. The raw materials of the flour currently sold by the factory are all purchased earlier, so the price of fair-priced flour can be lowered.

### Japanese Troops in Shanghai Will Be Transferred

The Continental News reported that, according to reliable sources, there were 14 Japanese transport ships at the mouth of the Yangtze River on the 25th. According to people who came to Shanghai via the mouth of the Yangtze River, each ship seemed to be empty, and it was expected to be loaded and transferred from the Japanese army in the Yangtze River. As for when each ship would arrive at the mouth of the Yangtze River to stop or stay there for a long time, it is not known. Observers said that the Japanese army in Shanghai seems to have a large-scale transfer.

### Too Crowded Delivery: Kunming Parcels Temporarily Suspended

For bulk commodity parcels sent to Kunming, the Shanghai Postal Administration has been congested since it resumed accepting them the day before yesterday, resulting in mountains of accumulation. According to a reporter from the New Sound Society, the bureau has decided to temporarily suspend acceptance from tomorrow. Those who have registered but have not been able to deliver them should complete the delivery tomorrow (because the bureau is closed today as usual). In addition, Kunming bulk small packages will be accepted as usual.

### Taxpaying Westerners' Annual Meeting Scheduled; Additional Donations Included in the Agenda; Will Be Decided by Voting; Municipal Council Intends to Increase Reserve Fund

The annual meeting of the Public Concession Taxpaying Westerners Association has now been decided to be held at the General Assembly Hall of the Racecourse at 2:30 pm on April 17. The list of attendees will be published in the Municipal Council Gazette to be published today. According to Article 19 of the Yangjingbang Land Charter, any taxpayer who is unable to attend the annual meeting due to illness or leaving Shanghai may appoint a representative to attend. According to the reporter from the Great China News Agency, the agenda of the conference is expected to have two major items. One is the issue of the Municipal Council increasing donations and taxes, which is expected to cause fierce debate. It is heard that the final decision will be made by voting. The other is the issue of increasing the Municipal Council's reserve fund. The Municipal Council's 1939 final accounts will also be reviewed at the annual meeting. The chairman of the conference will be Judge Moss of the British Supreme Court, and Moss has agreed.

According to the Municipal Council Information Office, any taxpayer with voting rights who wishes to request a copy of the Municipal Council's annual report for the previous year can directly write to the General Office of the Bureau at 209 Jiangxi Road, but the word "annual report" should be noted on the envelope.

### Three Blood Cases Occurred Within Two Hours Yesterday Morning: Xue Xianyang Shot Near Paramount Hotel; Ma Shaoquan Shot at the Entrance of Fulili Road Xicun; Xu Shen Shot Three Times on Hongkou Hanbi Li Road

Yesterday morning, three assassination cases occurred one after another within two hours in the French Concession of the Public Concession. The protagonists of the three cases were Xue Xianyang, a member of the current "Two-Road Party Department," Ma Buquan, and Xu Shen, a reporter for the Xin Shen Bao. After the above three cases occurred, all circles were shocked. The details obtained in each case are recorded in detail below.

Xue Xianyang

A shooting occurred near the Paramount Ballroom in West Shanghai at about 8:26 yesterday morning. The person shot was Xue Xianyang from Wusong, who was shot four times. He was later taken to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. Because of the serious injuries, his life was in danger. Xue Xianyang is 38 years old, a native of Wusong, with children. He lived at 7 Lane 259 Yu Yuan Road. Before the war, he was a section member of the Machinery Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. He is currently the so-called "Executive Committee Member of the Two-Road Party." Xue goes to the "Two-Road Employees' Correspondence Office" at 416 Sichuan Road every day to work, and is very active. At around 8:26 yesterday morning, Xue was wearing a light-colored French flannel suit, a woolen overcoat, a felt hat, and yellow leather shoes. As usual, he went to Sichuan Road to work. When passing near the Paramount Ballroom on Yu Yuan Road, he was about to take a public bus east on the road when suddenly two people ambushed on the side of the road. Seeing Xue approaching, they suddenly shot and fired four bullets, all of which hit. Two bullets penetrated his chest from the back, and two bullets hit his buttocks. He fell beside the stone steps in front of the Lao Juxing Fruit Shop at No. 237, and blood flowed out. At that time, the shooter took the opportunity to escape into the crowd. After being wounded, Xue was still conscious at the time and could barely open his mouth to ask the guards to urgently call an ambulance to take him to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road. Because the Jing'an Temple Police Station in charge was nearby, he ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene. They took the injured person to Fumin Hospital, retrieved several empty bullet casings around the scene, and took them back to the police station for research.

Ma Shaoquan

Ma Shaoquan, a native of Wuxi, who lives at 8 Xicun, 355 Lane, Fulili Road, French Concession, is 46 years old this year. He was a member of the Shanghai Municipal Coal Ash Industry Association. He is currently the general manager of Lixin Printing and Dyeing Factory, a printing and dyeing company of American Liming Knitting Company. Ma usually travels in his own car. Recently, he hired Xu Bingfa from Hebei as a bodyguard, who follows him armed every day. At 9:40 am yesterday, Ma and his bodyguard Xu Bingfa took a car from their residence in Xicun to go to work. Ma sat in the back of the car, and Xu sat with the driver. When the car had just driven out of the lane on Xicun Road, four men suddenly rushed out from the side of the road and ran to Ma's car. One man held a large stone and smashed Ma's car, shattering the car window into a large hole. Two people in front of the car prevented the car from moving forward, and another man took out a pistol and shot more than ten shots at Ma and the bodyguard. Ma was shot once in the left shoulder and right arm, and the right buttock was scratched by a bullet. The bodyguard Xu Bingfa was shot in three places, two bullets in the abdomen and one bullet in the right hand. The murderer saw that the purpose had been achieved and fled separately. After being wounded, Ma immediately ordered the driver to drive back to the residence. His family immediately called the Lujiawan French Police Station and immediately summoned an ambulance to rush the injured Ma and Xu to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, Chinese and foreign detectives were sent to the scene of the incident to investigate and look for bullet casings, and to investigate the reasons for Ma's victimization. Ma was very conscious after being injured and admitted to the hospital. According to his family, Ma originally intended to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong, but he was unable to make the trip due to miscellaneous matters, but he was unexpectedly subjected to this accident.

Xu Shen

A reporter for the current "Xin Shen Bao" was passing by the corner of Hongkou Hanbi Li Road and Miller Road at about 10:00 yesterday when suddenly a person jumped out from the side of the road and shot him. He was shot three times in the vital parts of his chest and abdomen, and he immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and unconscious. When the street guards heard the sound and rushed to the scene, the shooter had disappeared. They immediately took him to Fumin Hospital for treatment. After the hospital performed surgery, the bullets were removed, but his life was still in critical condition. It is heard that Xu Shen's name is Jiqiao, a native of Jinshan, 35 years old. He used to work as a field worker for the Shibao, and later joined a major news agency. After leaving his job due to an incident, he joined the "Xin Shen Bao" for service due to the times after "August 13th." He also served as a counselor in the staff headquarters of the Central China Special Service Agency. He usually frequented the Huiquan Tea House on Fuzhou Road.

### Japanese Side Implements Food Control and Blockade: Refugee Area Cut Off Food for Four Days: 20,000 Wretched People Driven to the Brink of Starvation: Resolved After Negotiations with the French Authorities

The refugees accommodated in the refugee area in the south of the city numbered no less than 200,000 during the August 13th battle. After continuous repatriation, up to recently there were still 20,000 refugees accommodated. The food consumption of the refugees in the area reached 1,800 bags per month, and the Finance Committee of the refugee area directly signed a contract with the merchants, and the Japanese Military Police issued an "Import Permit" to transport the food for supply. Recently, because the Japanese side attempted to "prosper" the market and opened up the south of the city, Japanese commercial institutions moved in one after another. Then there was the "Rice Grain Company," which was a

Rice Control

The food consumption in the refugee area is quite large, but they cannot be controlled by it, and they have been coveting it for a long time. On the 17th of this month, after the expiration of the "Import Permit" for food in the refugee area, the Japanese side did not continue to issue it. On one side, they strongly demanded that the refugee area authorities accept the request for rice and grain control. The refugee area authorities have a contract with the merchants in the concession for the supply of rice and grain. The Japanese request is difficult to accept, so they refused. Therefore, the Japanese side

Blockade Food Input

As a result, 20,000 refugees in the refugee area, except for some of the elderly and weak who used thin porridge and boiled water to satisfy their hunger every day, most of them pawned their clothes, hats, and shoes for rice to maintain their lives. However, the income was very little, not enough for a full meal, and those who could not pawn anything had to cry and wail all day long. 20,000 wretched people were driven to the brink of starvation, and those who were cut off from food reached four days. The tragic situation cannot be imagined by those who wear silk and eat meat in the concession. The authorities in the refugee area, knowing that the situation was serious, knew that it would be ineffective to negotiate with the Japanese side alone, so they asked the French Concession authorities to

Strongly Negotiate

If the rice and grain were not released immediately, the iron gates of the French Concession would be closed. The Japanese side was eager to "prosper" the south of the city, so they had to accept it and issued the "Import Permit" immediately. On the 23rd of this month, 300 bags of rice and grain had been transported in, and 500 bags were transported in the day before yesterday, so the food cut-off panic in the refugee area in the south of the city was resolved.

### Chairman Lin: Broadcast Tonight: Shanghai Can Listen

Today is the Memorial Day of the Martyrs of Huanghuagang. Chairman Lin of the National Government will give an important broadcast speech on current affairs to compatriots at home and abroad at 7:00 tonight. It will be broadcast jointly by the Central Broadcasting Station (call sign XGOA 1200 kilocycles) and the International Broadcasting Station (call sign XGOY 11900 kilocycles). All radio stations in the country will broadcast it simultaneously. Shanghai can also listen. However, it is found that 7:00 pm Eastern Time is equal to 8:00 pm Shanghai time.

### French Concession Equalization Committee: Proposes Two Matters: Adopting New Weights and Measures System: Investigating Responsible Persons in Various Industries

The French Concession Price Equalization Committee was originally scheduled to hold its third congress yesterday, but at the committee meeting the day before yesterday, the members of the committee believed that, in order to gather ideas and benefit, it was necessary to wait until the report from the Police Department of the Public Concession arrived before the plenary meeting could make a second decision. Therefore, yesterday's congress temporarily announced the postponement. At the committee meeting the day before yesterday, someone proposed to hold two matters: (1) to adopt a "new system of weights and measures" in the French Concession; (2) to investigate the names of the responsible persons in various industries, and to order the responsible persons to report the rise and fall of market prices to the committee at any time.

### Tokens for Public Buses, Etc.: No Longer Produced and Issued: Various Companies in the Two Concessions: Have Been Recalled As Much As Possible

The British China General Omnibus Company and Tram Company and the French Water and Electricity Company in this port used to issue copper, aluminum, and nickel metal tokens and various denominations of coins because of the lack of dime coins in the market and the difficulty of making change, in order to solve the difficulty of making change. Since the Bank of China issued one-cent and five-cent coin notes, the circulation amount has been quite large, which is enough to meet the needs. Therefore, in addition to trying to recall the previously issued tokens and coins as much as possible, each company will not print and issue them in the future.

### More Than 300 Groups of American Chambers of Commerce: Public Banquet to Gauss

Foreign newspaper reporters, because American Consul Gauss is about to leave Shanghai and return to his country, held a farewell banquet for him in the Gold Room of the American Club yesterday afternoon. This Saturday, more than 300 groups including the American Chamber of Commerce will jointly hold a banquet for Gauss at the Columbia Club at 6:30 pm. Commander Glassford of the American Yangtze River Fleet, Colonel Baker, and Judge Haimilk and his wife will all attend as guests, and the American Fourth Naval Band will play music to help the fun.

American University Alumni Association: Grand Dinner Party the Night Before Last

The Continental News reported that the American University Alumni Association held a dinner dance party at the American General Assembly Hall on the night of the 27th to say farewell to Gauss, the former American Consul General in Shanghai and the first American Minister to Australia. It was chaired by Shen Siliang, the president of the alumni association. About 300 members and guests attended. The guests included Gauss, Bowden, the Australian Trade Commissioner to China, Judge Haimilk and his wife, the American Naval Attaché Judge, Colonel Baker and his wife, the Commander of the US Fourth Battle Squadron, Rear Admiral Glassford and his wife, and Shi Zhaoji, the former Chinese Ambassador to the United States. During the banquet, Haimilk and Bowden gave farewell speeches, and former President Bassett presented Gauss with a gift on behalf of the members. The guests and hosts had a good time and dispersed when they were satisfied.

### Gu Shengqi: Died in the Line of Duty

Wangjiangjing District, Jiaxing County, is the transportation center of the Jiaxing Line and the Canal. Since the National Army withdrew to the west and Jiaxing fell, Yang Andun and Gu Shengqi (graduated from the former Whampoa Military Academy) were ordered to organize the Fourth Squadron of the Jiaxing County National Corps. Surrounded by evil forces, he did not avoid dangers, defended his hometown, and urged and led the local area to be peaceful. However, because the northeast neighboring villages were plagued by banditry, and bandits disturbed several times a night, Captain Gu repeatedly decided to personally lead the team to suppress and arrest them, and they captured quite a lot. Therefore, these people held a grudge and plotted to harm him in every possible way. On the night of March 18, Captain Gu led the team out to patrol and encountered a large gang of bandits on the border of Chixi Township. After several hours of fierce fighting, he unfortunately died in action due to the disparity in strength. The bad news came out, and the people in the entire district mourned him.

### Domestic Postage Rates Increased: Have Been Approved: New Stamps Are Being Printed: Date of Price Increase Not Announced

The Ministry of Communications has submitted the matter of increasing domestic postage rates to the Legislative and Executive Yuan for approval. Therefore, this matter is actually a matter of time. It is obviously too late to implement it on April 1st. At the same time, the Postal Administration had not received the order to increase prices from the Kunming Postal Administration as of yesterday. Once domestic postage rates are increased, new stamps must be printed due to the different amounts on the stamps. It is now known that Hong Kong is printing them, and it is also known that before the new stamps are printed, the currently used stamps will be temporarily applied with an additional stamp. However, there is no definite news on the exact date of the price increase.

### Candidates for Japanese Board Members Will be Elected Early Next Month. Reportedly Due to Unfinished Procedures. Reflecting Demands to Increase the Number of Japanese Directors.

According to Japanese sources, the election of Japanese candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) board, originally scheduled for yesterday (the 28th), has been postponed to early next month at the Japanese Club due to unfinished procedures. Previous reports mentioned the recommendation of two Japanese assistants by the Japanese Residents' Association to assist with the election, approved by the former Council. According to a reporter from the Ta Chung News Agency, after further inquiries, the two Japanese assistants are Takiguchi Masahide and Iwasaki Hideo, recommended by the Shanghai branch manager of Yokohama Specie Bank, Kishi Nami, and have been approved by election supervisor Mr. Brent and others. Takiguchi is currently an employee of the Yokohama Specie Bank branch and also serves as the acting branch manager. Iwasaki is currently the head of the dispatching section of the East Asia Shipping Company. Their duties in the election will be to assist the supervisors, while Mr. Brent and others will oversee the voting, guard the ballot boxes, and count the votes.

Japanese Demands to Increase Candidates

Regarding the Japanese demand to increase the number of candidates, British and American figures in the city have repeatedly expressed their opinions, believing that in the past history of the SMC, the Japanese have repeatedly attempted this, but never succeeded. They also believe that the power of the Japanese in Shanghai is difficult to rival that of the British and American communities. Some also believe that if Japanese taxpayers could cooperate with Chinese taxpayers, they might be able to obtain an absolute majority in the SMC and exclude British and American influence. However, this is currently impossible. It is generally speculated that this year's attempt by the Japanese will suffer the same fate. However, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated yesterday that the Japanese residents in Shanghai intend to nominate several more candidates for the upcoming SMC board election. The spokesman claimed that representatives from various Japanese organizations and the Japanese Residents' Association will soon hold a joint meeting to decide on the number of additional candidates to be nominated. The Japanese residents are currently working on investigating to determine the number of votes and the total number of Japanese taxpayers. Once this issue is resolved, the meeting will be held. The spokesman repeatedly emphasized that the Japanese side intends to increase the number of Japanese directors, pointing out that the number of Japanese residents in Shanghai has increased sharply in recent years, and therefore the number of Japanese taxpayers has also increased. The number of candidates to be nominated by the Japanese side is currently an important issue. If the Japanese continue to nominate two people as usual, the SMC board election seems unnecessary. However, judging from the spokesman's statement and recent rumors that the Japanese want to increase the number of Japanese directors, this year's SMC board election will be very fierce. The deadline for nominating candidates for the SMC board will be next Tuesday (April 2nd), so the Japanese have six days to decide everything. The election will be held on April 10th and 11th.

### Rickshaw Drivers Request Increase in Alcohol Allowance, Negotiations Today, Both Parties Express Opinions, Attitudes are Very Sincere

The drivers of the four major dispatch car companies in this city, Xiang Sheng, Taylor, Silver, and Yunfei, requested an increase in alcohol allowance from their employers. The drivers of these companies each sent four representatives on the 22nd of this month to negotiate with the employers, but no satisfactory solution was reached. Both parties immediately agreed to negotiate again this afternoon to find a solution.

Employer's Opinion

In the past week, the employers of each company have jointly studied the matter several times. The result is that each driver is allowed an increase of half a corner for rice subsidy per person. However, the labor side felt that this was a drop in the bucket and difficult to solve the problem, and finally did not accept it. According to the employers, if the drivers' request to increase the alcohol allowance is implemented, customers may not be willing to accept it, especially Western customers. In that case, the company would have to be responsible, and the loss would be too great, especially since Taylor Motor Company's customers are mostly foreigners, and according to foreign customs, this request is difficult to realize.

Labor's Difficulties

According to the labor side of a certain company among the four major motor companies, the hardships of the drivers are not known to outsiders. Taking the drivers of a certain company as an example, the highest salary is only nine corners per day (plus three corners for rice subsidy, totaling one yuan and two corners), and the lowest is only five corners per day (including eight corners for rice subsidy). Moreover, the company only has over a hundred vehicles, while there are over three hundred drivers. Therefore, each driver can only work an average of fifteen or sixteen days per month, earning only ten yuan or so per month. Adding the original alcohol allowance, it is only twenty or thirty yuan. It is difficult to provide for personal food and expenses with this limited salary, let alone a family burden. Furthermore, if they are slightly negligent and violate traffic rules, they will be fined three to five yuan by the police, all of which are borne by the drivers themselves. In addition, if the drivers accidentally damage the car, they are also liable for compensation. As for working hours, they are irregular for sleep and meals, and many people suffer from illness. Moreover, the company has raised the fare three times, while the labor side only receives a meager rice subsidy. The company's profits last year reached a huge sum of over 770,000 yuan. Our request is really not excessive, they said.

Driver's Attitude

The labor representatives of each company met yesterday afternoon at 3 pm to discuss everything. The result of the discussion was that the half a corner that the employer is willing to add for rice subsidy only amounts to two yuan or so per month for us (because the drivers can only work a dozen days or so per month on average). Our request is for alcohol allowance, not rice subsidy, so it is difficult to accept. Moreover, our request to increase the alcohol allowance can be abolished once prices fall. It does not seem to be inappropriate in terms of reason and emotion. As for the rumor that if the negotiations do not have satisfactory results, we will all strike, this is a misunderstanding. Since we made this request, we have all maintained a sincere attitude, knowing that it is absolutely impossible to easily strike and disrupt ourselves at this time and place. However, for the sake of maintaining a livelihood, we are also determined not to make excessive concessions. It is also learned that the labor and management will hold negotiations this afternoon, and the location may be in the Big World Ballroom. Each company will send four representatives to participate, it is said. It is also learned that both parties have a very sincere attitude, and the negotiations should be able to achieve a satisfactory solution.

### Shanghai War Loss Compensation Case, Lawsuit for Over 20,000 US Dollars, China East Electric Company Sues American Insurance Company, The Key is Robbery Rather Than War Loss, American Consular Court Once Tried

Continental News: The China East Electric Company, a Chinese-owned company at 959 Zhoujiazui Road, suffered major losses during the Shanghai War in 1937. However, the company had insured with the American Home Insurance Company, so it demanded compensation of US$27,000. However, the Home Insurance Company claimed that the China East Company's machines were robbed rather than damaged during the war, resulting in a lawsuit. The American Consular Court in China held a continued trial on the 27th. Peng Nat, the head of the Huishan Police Station during the Shanghai War, testified in court. He stated that in the second half of 1937, the Japanese army had engaged in "rampant looting" in the Huishan area. In September of that year, he personally witnessed Japanese naval infantry looting in the area, but did not see any Chinese looting. He never saw Japanese soldiers stop other Japanese soldiers from looting. Starting at the end of that year, the Japanese army systematically looted machinery and various steel items, accumulating three large piles in the Huishan area, he said. After the British Huake and other witnesses from the Shanghai Water Company testified, the court adjourned and scheduled a continued trial.

### Agreement Reached on Allocation of Low-Priced Coal Dust, Sales to Begin Next Month, 100 Yuan Per Ton, Total of 1,000 Tons, Coal Ball Prices Should be Further Reduced

The Shanghai Municipal Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 pm at the association hall at 59 Hong Kong Road, inviting representatives from various coal dust companies to allocate low-priced coal dust. Xu Jiqing and Yan E'sheng from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were present, as well as You Chunxin and He Ziguo and other representatives from Yitaixing, Dalongxing, Hancheng, Tongcheng and other coal companies, and Chen Cuifang, chairman of the Coal Ball Industry Association. Xu Jiqing presided over the meeting. The chairman first read the minutes of the previous meeting, and then began allocating low-priced coal. Yitai was allocated 500 tons, Dalongxing 300 tons, Hancheng 100 tons, and Tongcheng 100 tons, totaling 1,000 tons. The flat price was 100 yuan per ton in national currency, allocated to 24 small coal ball factories, and it was decided to start sales on April 1st and end on April 10th. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. In addition, the Shanghai Cooked Water Industry Association voluntarily donated to refugee relief after obtaining low-priced coal dust this time, 10 yuan per household. Since the beginning, donations have been very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, around 1,000 yuan had been collected and dispatched to Yu Qiaqing of the Flat Price Committee, Yuan Fudeng of the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute, and Huang Yanfang of the Refugee Relief Branch, 300 yuan each, totaling 900 yuan. However, the industry association is still urging members to continue to donate to continue sending to the above charitable organizations.

### Puppet Market Coerces Local Goods Industry, No Results, Taxes and Commissions Layered Exploitation, South City Industry Always Firmly Refuses

The "Central Market" held an opening ceremony on the 22nd of this month and decided to officially open for business on April 1st. Then it actively coerced local goods and other industries in the city to join, but the industries in various places in South City have always refused. The details are now divided as follows:

Extensive Control

According to a reporter's investigation, the control range of the "market" is very wide. The "market" reportedly plans to raise 5 million yuan in capital. If you join the "market", you must pay at least 500 yuan in capital. The size of the business depends on the amount of capital paid. If you don't pay, you can't do business in the "market".

Heavy Donations and Commissions

At present, the taxes and fees donated by local goods such as dried meat transported to Shanghai from various roads are already more than 60%. After the puppet "market" wants to implement control, it also collects a 10% commission on those who have already paid taxes. This commission is paid to the "Wholesalers Association" organized by the Japanese puppets. According to local goods industry sources, the Japanese can net 20% of this commission, and the rest is used as public funds for the "market".

Industry Firmly Refuses

The South City local goods industry, mainly fruits and dried meat, has been coerced by the Japanese puppets many times, but has not yet joined. The various industries there believe that if they join the "market" to do business, under the control of the Japanese puppets, they are afraid that not only will there be no profit to be made, but before joining, they must first pay a huge deposit. According to sources in the industry, the active figure in the 16th pier area is the owner of a certain local goods store that has now closed down.

### Apprentice Brazenly Kidnaps Child for Ransom, Demanding 50,000, Two Criminals Arrested, Inner Ticket Already Rescued in Changzhou

Zhou Xisheng, a native of Changzhou who resides on Route Robert and currently runs the Zhou Xiji Plank Box Shop, had his only son, Wen Zhao (6 years old), kidnapped at 3:20 pm on the 10th of this month while accompanying his sister Jin Feng to study at the Life Elementary School at 1085 Gordon Road. The kidnappers were Xu Ronghu, a fellow townsman and former apprentice coppersmith at Zhou Xisheng's former shop in Zhabei, in collusion with Xu Genda (also a native of Changzhou and an apprentice coppersmith) who was at large, to lure Zhou's child.

Kidnapped Without a Trace

After Zhou Xisheng reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, the police dispatched detectives to arrest Xu Ronghu at the Tai Ji Coppersmith Shop at 120 Dagulu Road, brought him to the police station, and sent him to the First Branch Court, which was postponed. Zhou Xisheng received an anonymous letter delivered by the Changzhou Ben Niu Post Office, stating that if he wanted his son Wen Zhao back, he had to pay 50,000 yuan, which made him realize that Wen Zhao

Was Hidden in Changzhou

He entrusted relatives and friends to take the train to Changzhou to investigate the whereabouts of Zhou's child and learned that Wen Zhao was hidden in an empty house in the Lion Lane outside the North Gate. He reported the situation to the puppet police of the Water Patrol Team, who rescued Zhou Wen Zhao at the address, while Xu Genda had fled upon hearing the news. Only a young man named Xu Cai Di, who was guarding Zhou's child, was apprehended and taken to the Water Patrol Team for detention. Zhou's child was

Returned to Shanghai by Relatives

Yesterday, Judge Liu Yukui came to the Third Criminal Court to investigate the case. Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer for the police station, stated that although the defendants Xu Ronghu and Xu Genda, who were at large, were young, this method constituted kidnapping for ransom. The case should be adjourned again. Zhou's child then accompanied his father to court to prove that the defendant and Xu Genda gave him candy on the way and said they would take him

To See a Play Somewhere

They took a rickshaw to a train station, took a train to Changzhou, and hid him there, etc. When questioned, the defendant claimed that Xu Genda was the instigator and asked for leniency. Judge Liu ordered that he be remanded in custody for further verification.

### Shanghai West Gambling Dens, Lingering On, Using Sex to Attract Gamblers, Fierce Infighting Between Two Gangs

The Shanghai West Bad Land gambling tax has a monthly income of 1.8 million yuan, so the puppet municipal government and a certain puppet organization once planned to seize it. It has been rumored for a long time that the Japanese side is unwilling to give up this income and still wants to continue to control it. Large gambling dens such as Hollywood, Zhao Feng, Yuyuan, Qiu, Monte Carlo, and their branch gambling dens in Caojiadu and other places, such as Da Sheng, are taking the opportunity to squeeze each other, so that some will close down and be able to concentrate profits. Therefore, the gambling dens of Guang Sheng and Da Xin were closed down and fled after Sun Shucheng was reported by Yang Abing. Xu Weijiang and others interrogated the accomplice Wang. Shao Lian of Rong Sheng Company also sold the gambling den and fled to Hong Kong, creating a confrontation between the Zhu and Gao gangs. Illegal things are endless, such as instigating gangsters to rob gamblers from other gambling dens, which happens almost every day. At the same time, the Yuyuan was bombed, and several gamblers died tragically. Zhao Feng also had a similar incident. Therefore, gamblers are afraid to move forward, and the doors can be used to catch sparrows. Now, because the Japanese puppets have ordered to use dance halls or entertainment and restaurants and tea rooms as a guise, they issue two licenses for entertainment venues and clubs. Therefore, gamblers use this as a smokescreen, advertising and luring gamblers to try to save the decline. Among them, Zhao Feng and others, who use dance halls as a guise, even use nude dancing to anesthetize the crowd, which is truly a strange phenomenon in the den of sin. There have been rumors of the closure of gambling dens in Shanghai West many times, but according to the reporter's personal investigation in the Western District, the so-called amusement park clubs and flower associations are still everywhere. Even the gambling stalls built with mat sheds still gather people to gamble. The saying of banning gambling is obviously empty talk.

### Xu Qizhong and Sheng Meiying End Cohabitation Relationship, Sheng's Counterclaim for Compensation for Damages Rejected

Xu Qizhong, the son of Zhejiang gentleman Xu Guannan, who was traveling in Shanghai, concluded with Sheng Meiying, a dancer in the Grand Shanghai Ballroom in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Then he was tempted by her and instigated by bad friends. In the following year, he rented a house to live with her. However, Sheng was born in a dance hall and was extravagant by nature. Her daily life was extremely luxurious. In a few years, Xu Qizhong

Exhausted his efforts to supply her, spending as much as 100,000 yuan, resulting in heavy debts that he was unable to repay. He finally declared bankruptcy in the winter of the 24th year of the Republic of China. Since then, it was not easy to live in Shanghai, so he moved his family to Suzhou to reduce expenses, and Sheng also went with him, renting a house to live separately. In the middle, Sheng had left Suzhou once in a fit of anger because she could not get what she wanted, but soon quietly returned. Xu Qizhong compromised. At that time, the feelings between the two were still not bad. When the war broke out, Xu led his family to Shanghai via Suzhou, who had survived the robbery. The economy was extremely difficult, and all expenses could not fully satisfy Sheng's intention. Sheng Jianyu's golden age has passed

Unable to deal with it, she took advantage of people's unpreparedness and rolled away her clothes and decorations at dawn on April 6th last year and never returned. In addition to asking a lawyer to send a letter to Xu demanding huge sums of money, she also published huge warning notices in various newspapers in Shanghai, and applied to Xu for reconciliation and payment of living expenses to the Special First Court, and filed a criminal lawsuit for abandonment, which had already been ruled that Xu Qizhong was innocent. Xu decided that he could not persuade her to return to continue living together, knowing that she could not live in poverty and wanted to leave. If she was left outside, it would not be a good idea after a long time. So he hired lawyers Lu Shaozong and Shen E to file a lawsuit against Sheng to

End Cohabitation

Relationship, At first, when the two were living together, they signed a cohabitation contract, which stated that if either party wanted to terminate the cohabitation, they had to compensate the other party for damages of 10,000 yuan. To this end, Sheng also filed a counterclaim, demanding Xu Qizhong to pay 10,000 yuan. The case has been tried and concluded by Judge Xu Fuji, and the verdict was given a few days ago to allow the two parties to end their cohabitation relationship, and Sheng Meiying's counterclaim for payment of 10,000 yuan was dismissed.

### Fuxin Flour Factory, Workers Riot, Thirteen People Injured, One Hit by Stray Bullet

Workers at the Fuxin Flour Factory on Dasulu West Suzhou Road in the Public Concession were previously contracted by foreman Yu Qingzhi (36 years old). Now, Yu has left his job due to an incident, and new foreman Xue Yougui has taken over. At around 10 am yesterday, Xu led more than 100 new workers to take over. At that time, the old workers used by Xue were unwilling to lose their jobs once and blocked the new workers from entering the factory. The two sides then clashed. The workers on both sides had weapons such as iron rods. For a time, they were twisted and fought in a group, and many people were injured. Then, Huapu No. 1515, No. 515, and No. 480 heard the police and arrived. Because there were many workers, they were unable to persuade them. In order to maintain order, they fired shots into the sky as a warning. However, at that time, a stray bullet hit Gao Jinsheng (22 years old), a native of Jiangbei, in the right leg, and he fell to the ground injured. At the same time, 13 workers were injured, including Guo Wenzi, 53 years old, seriously injured in the head, He Erhui, 32 years old, Qiao Laosha, 63 years old, Lu Wenzhang, 22 years old, Li Shouru, 33 years old, Yao Deyang, 36 years old, Yan Baosheng, 32 years old, Pan Yixiu, 43 years old, Zhang Ziyuan, 60 years old, Zhang Achen, 32 years old, Shi Abing, 27 years old, Zhang Renqing, 25 years old, Liu Baosheng, 28 years old, each had injuries. Afterwards, they were all sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Counterfeit Liu Shen Wan, Each Defendant Fined

Lei You of the Shang Song Fen Tang Pharmacy recently found that someone on the market was counterfeiting the Liu Shen Wan produced by the pharmacy, and the Jin Chang Watch Shop on Simalu publicly published advertisements to sell them at low prices. They started an investigation and sent someone to buy several boxes from Jin Chang. Upon inspection, they were indeed counterfeit. They reported to the Old Ah Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Zhou Xianggen, Hua Guanqing, Wang Jingxin, Wu Shanfa, Wang Minsheng, and Ye Ziqing, among others, and copied out a large number of Liu Shen Wan. They brought them to the police station and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation. The day before yesterday, Fang Justice of the Peace continued the trial of the case in the Fourth Criminal Court. Chiang Baolien, the lawyer for the police station, filed a lawsuit according to law, and the Shang Song Fen Tang Pharmacy hired Fan Gang and Yu Enliang as lawyers to attend the court to bring incidental civil lawsuits, requesting that the defendants be jointly and severally liable for compensation for losses of 21,300 yuan in national currency. Questioning the defendants, they jointly hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Qian Yuzhong to defend them in court. After Fang Justice of the Peace inquired clearly, he sentenced Zhou Xianggen and Hua Guanqing to not guilty, Wang Jingxin and Wu Shanfa each to a fine of 100 yuan, Wang Minsheng to a fine of 200 yuan, and Ye Ziqing to a fine of 300 yuan, and compensated the victim for losses of 600 yuan, and the counterfeit Liu Shen Wan was confiscated.

### Youth Association Holds, Deaf-Mute Art Exhibition, Displaying Over 1,000 Works, Open to the Public Free of Charge

The Shanghai Youth Association recognizes that deaf-mute compatriots are also members of the country. Although they are congenitally deficient, deaf in the ear and mute in the mouth, many of them are intelligent and talented, and some are even better than ordinary people. Last month, the association established a deaf-mute society to teach them knowledge of morality, intelligence, physical education, and group education, which has been quite effective. Now, in order to promote deaf-mute art, it has been decided to hold a deaf-mute art exhibition at the association's second floor in Baxianqiao from the 29th, 30th, and 31st of this month, from 1 pm to 7 pm every day. It has collected deaf-mute works from all over Shanghai, various handicrafts, patterns, posters, photographs, embroidery, seals, sculptures, plaster models, and other items, totaling over 1,000 pieces, which are displayed among them. In addition, there are performance programs, on-site painting, and Q&A with guests. The association is now arranging everything and welcomes people from all walks of life to visit free of charge.

### Detective Extortion Case, Sentenced to Imprisonment Separately

Zhu Gaoji, who entered French nationality, was sent to the Consulate for interrogation. Lu Guanfu, Wang Enhan, and Jiang Xian, new detectives from the former French police station, extorted 5,000 yuan from Wang Yaokun, the owner of the sesame oil workshop at 78 Xiaodongmen Street, on the grounds of searching for opium on the morning of the 11th of last month, together with accomplices Zhu Gaoji, Wang Kunde, and Gao Haogen. Wang only paid out 600 yuan as a reward. Lu and others continued to negotiate because the numbers were too far apart. Wang immediately telegraphed the police station to report the situation. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Lu and others and send them to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court for trial. Zhang Minsheng Justice of the Peace presided over the trial. The police prosecuted each defendant for the crime of intimidation and fraud, but the fourth defendant, Zhu Gaoji, had entered French nationality and was transferred to the French Consulate for interrogation. The case was concluded yesterday morning. The main text was that Lu Guanfu, Wang Enhan, Jiang Xian, and Wang Kunde jointly intended to illegally possess themselves, intimidating others to deliver goods, and each was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Gao Haogen helped to intimidate and defraud, and was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. All defendants were remanded to the detention center.

The New Asia Library is located in the Cishou Building on Nanjing Road. Because of its convenient location and abundant books, it is extremely crowded with readers. Recently, I heard that the library has another service department, specializing in copying books, handwriting regular script, and typing for social people at low cost and simple procedures. Now the library's delivery department has also ordered a convenient method. Readers join the monthly fee of 1 yuan in legal currency. The library sends a new magazine every three days for circulation. It is really good news for scholars. For detailed methods, the charter can be requested in person.

### Old Newspaper Excerpts Sixty-Seven Years Ago (338)

(From the Shun Pao, Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Dismembered Qing Dynasty)

Official Selection

The methods of selecting officials in ancient and modern times differ, and the paths to becoming officials also vary. From the era of Emperors Yao and Shun to the Ming Dynasty, a comprehensive review reveals the details. When a wise ruler is in power, the selection of officials is a collective endeavor; when a mediocre ruler is in power, it is a matter solely determined by the ruler; and when a foolish ruler is in power, officials seek their own advancement. When even generals seek their own positions, the state is inevitably headed for ruin. How can we say it's a collective endeavor? Observe Yao's selection of Shun and Shun's selection of Yu. Initially, they consulted the Four Mountains; then, based on the unanimous recommendations of the Four Mountains, they finally placed them in the court. Later, the selection of officials during the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties followed similar patterns. The reason why the reigns of the Three Emperors and Five Kings surpassed all others was undoubtedly due to their ability to select officials effectively. How can we say it's a matter solely determined by the ruler? The system of the Han dynasty did not emulate the emperors and kings but only followed the example of Qin Shi Huang. The ruler became increasingly exalted, while the ministers became increasingly humble. In governance, they constantly emphasized the sole control of authority; in selecting officials, they constantly emphasized that appointments came solely from above, showing a disdain for treating rulers and ministers as equals. However, there were occasional exceptions, such as Emperor Wu of Han's appointment of Ji Changru and Emperor Taizong of Tang's appointment of Wei Wenzhen. Although they often dared to speak frankly and directly point out his faults, Emperor Wu of Han was still able to tolerate it, not seeing him without formal attire. Emperor Taizong, however, was merely seeking fame and praise, and he often endured Wei Wenzhen's blunt advice, returning to the palace with resentment, saying, "I must kill this country bumpkin to vent my hatred." If not for Wei Wenzhen's loyalty and Empress Zhangsun's admonitions, it would have been difficult to maintain consistency. As for others, they were promoted when pleased and demoted when angered, not selecting the worthy for the sake of the state but merely dispensing personal favors. Yet, Emperor Wu was able to entrust Huo Guang with the care of Emperor Zhao to assist him, while Emperor Taizong instead gave his final instructions to Gao Hanyu to elevate the Li clan. Their superiority or inferiority is self-evident. These two emperors were known as wise rulers of the Han and Tang dynasties, yet they acted in this way. How much more could we expect from those even less capable than them? Their selection of officials is even more readily apparent.

To be continued tomorrow.

Spring and Autumn

### Two Swindles

Shanghai is a mixed community with both good and bad people. With the high cost of living these days, various scams and shady dealings are unfolding almost daily. A slight lapse in vigilance can easily lead to significant losses. However, upon investigation, every scam has its own "opportunity." The following two submissions illustrate this point. One involves a thief who, under the guise of repairing water pipes, stole a radio. The scammer obviously knew about the festive occasion beforehand, and the fact that Shanghai residents "each sweep the snow from their own doorstep" provided him with the opportunity to act. The second involves the lure of cheapness. Isn't there a free government-run smallpox vaccination clinic? Yet people tend to trust a "stranger" who comes to their door (as a "special envoy"), and, after a bunch of nonsense, are swindled out of fifteen dollars. Therefore, residents should help and look out for each other. If everyone is indifferent and allows a repairman to roam around the house unescorted, even if he really is sent by the landlord, a "grab-and-run" situation is likely to occur (as has happened in the newspapers). And one should be even more cautious of a "stranger" who talks about "completely free service." (Editor)

### Hospital "Special Envoy"

— Jin

The day before yesterday, as I returned home in the evening and stepped onto the stairs, I already heard a barrage of complaints. Upon meeting Sister T, she told me disappointedly, "Bad luck! I was swindled out of fifteen dollars!" Indeed, this was the first time our family had been scammed.

The fact is this: Around three o'clock that afternoon, Sister T took fifteen dollars to buy something. As she ran downstairs, a stranger, a middle-aged man in his thirties wearing an old suit and overcoat, with a local accent, carrying a leather bag, barged into the landlord's house and said, "I am a special envoy from XX Hospital. Our hospital is entirely dedicated to charity. Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock, we will be providing free smallpox vaccinations at the intersection of Ganshi East Road (very close to my home). You must all go to get vaccinated! But those with dampness in their bodies cannot be vaccinated." Then he sat down and added, "If you encounter poor people who are sick, please send them to the hospital for treatment. 'We will not charge a single cent.'" After speaking, he left a note: "Zhao Zikun, No. 12, XX Hospital, across from the Great World." He also said that he would treat illnesses, "completely free of charge." However, those whom he cured were to give him a plaque to make him famous and to get him a ten-dollar raise at the hospital. In this way, no one would suspect that he was a swindler.

So the landlord was the first to ask him to examine her. When he got to the fifth person, Sister T's son, who is only six years old and has a skin condition, he said to Sister T, "This child will not be healthy until the dampness is removed. If I treat him, I guarantee he will gain weight. Let me examine him first and then prescribe medicine. However, you live upstairs. Since he has to take off his clothes, he will catch a cold here." Sister T honestly replied, "Upstairs." "That's great. Let's go upstairs to take a look." So everyone went upstairs. Sister T took off her son's outer garment and held him in her arms. There was no one else upstairs. He took out a copper cylinder about an inch in diameter and three inches long from his bag and placed it on the child's navel. Attached to the cylinder was a three-foot-long rubber tube, which he used like a suction pump. "There is electricity in here!" he said, spouting such nonsense. After a moment, he took off the cylinder, and there was some snot-like fluid inside, which he claimed was extracted from the body. Therefore, the navel needed to be bandaged immediately with medicine, which cost three to four dollars per bottle! About fifteen dollars in total. After buying it, vinegar had to be added and boiled together. He asked Sister T, "Are you literate?" "Yes." "What about English?" "I don't understand." "Then let me

### Martyrs' Day Reflections

— Wenying

What day is it today? Martyrs' Day. Twenty-nine years ago today, the martyrs, with their spirit of sacrifice, paid the price for freedom, creating this glorious page in history—to overthrow the Qing dynasty and liberate the people from tyranny.

But what about now? The darkness has exceeded that time by tens of millions of times. Oppression, humiliation, and slaughter are all intensified upon every compatriot in this place and at this time. We have lost freedom of body and mind, lost all guarantees, and are surrounded by serious threats. This darkness has brought us to an unbearable point. Therefore, today, in addition to sincere commemoration, we must continue the spirit of the martyrs, unleash everyone's strength, look at the current environment, and think about what we can do.

If we cannot continue the spirit of sacrifice of the martyrs, fighting for the country and the nation, and can only engage in a kind of ritualistic commemoration, then it is a disgrace to those who live on!

write an English medicine name for you!" As he spoke, he took the paper packet containing about fifteen dollars from Sister T's hand and wrote a few English words on it. Then he took out a plaster from his bag and said to Sister T, "Recite the method I just taught you for adding vinegar and boiling the medicine." After she recited it as he had instructed, he said, "No, someone once got my method wrong, and as a result, they ruined more than ten dollars' worth of Western medicine. Besides, the pharmacies now sell all their old stock to customers, the potency is insufficient, and the price is too high. I'm afraid you'll ruin the medicine, which would be a pity. So I'm willing to sell you medicine that I've already prepared and boiled at an 80% discount." Then he took out two bottles of so-called medicine powder from his bag, poured it on the plaster, and, strangely enough, the wallet disappeared without anyone knowing. He put the plaster on the child's navel and said, "Take good care of him, and he will be fine in twenty-four hours. I'll come again next week." After speaking, he packed up his belongings and left in a hurry.

### Repairing Water Pipes

— Guangzhao

On the third of this month, a day with light rain, it was a roommate's wedding day. Around ten o'clock, a young man wearing a blue work uniform, holding pliers and all the necessary plumbing parts, came to the door and said that the landlord had sent him to repair the water pipes. The cleaning lady in the kitchen thought that was right, as the water pipes in the toilet room were not very smooth, so she let him come upstairs. The people upstairs thought he was sent by the landlord and didn't pay attention to him. After going up and down more than ten times, people thought he was looking at the water pipes, but in fact, he was examining the items in each room. Around twelve o'clock, he said to the cleaning lady, "I'll come back to repair it in the afternoon." Around two o'clock, he came again. By that time, it was time for the wedding, and many people had gone to watch the ceremony. There was only one cleaning lady watching the house. The repairman went up and down again, just like in the morning. He suddenly said to the cleaning lady, "This water pipe can't be repaired without your radio upstairs." In fact, the radio and the water pipe were completely unrelated. Because the cleaning lady didn't understand, he had the opportunity to steal the radio. He said directly to the cleaning lady, "Let me take the radio down to fix it, so the water pipe can be repaired." The ignorant cleaning lady believed him and watched him take the radio down. After waiting for more than half an hour, he didn't come back, and the cleaning lady became anxious. She went down to check, but where could she check? The clever thief had probably already sold the item.

### Apples and Black Dates

— Xun

In recent days, many large apples and black dates have arrived in the market. Vendors are shouting and selling them on the side of the road, with baskets and bags full.

Apples are two for a dime, and black dates are five cents a bag, two dimes per pound. These prices are indeed extremely cheap in Shanghai, but please do not be tempted by this cheapness and do not be deceived by their lies. The apples are not from India but from Korea, and the black dates are not from Fujian but from Taiwan. Everyone should recognize this clearly.

### Rumors

— Yanxi Baihua

Living a lifetime, cherishing orchids and artemisia,
Ignoring those fickle ones before the winds.
Three words of murder confounded Zeng Shen,
Only this world grieves for the passing of Tang Sheng.
Clinging to flawed white jade, flies land,
Sitting on cold green mats, geese squabble for food.
Yet I laugh at the masses who are as dull as dullards,
Never willing to wash away the old glory, remaining rugged.

### A Sentence on the Cross

We believe that the words spoken by Jesus on the cross have been preserved to this day. Those present at the scene included John, a man of deep love and keen ears. There were three Marys: Jesus' mother, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene. They loved Jesus and naturally paid close attention to what he did. There were also many other women, as well as other disciples. According to Mark's account, there were also many people mocking Jesus. Although their spirits differed from the disciples, they also took note of Jesus' words. Thus, we can believe that everything Jesus said on the cross has been passed down to us. The seven sentences on the cross encompass everything. Among the seven sentences, Matthew recorded one, Luke recorded three, and John recorded three. These seven sentences represent the seven key points of Christ's personality and work. The first sentence is about forgiveness: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." The second sentence is about salvation: "Today you will be with me in paradise." This was said to the repentant thief. The third sentence is about love: "Woman, behold your son… Behold your mother." The fourth sentence is about atonement: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This shows what sin is and the pain that Christ suffered for atoning for humanity's sins. The fifth sentence is about physical suffering: "I am thirsty." The sixth sentence is about victory: "It is finished." Some believe that these two words "It is finished" are the greatest words, as no one but Jesus could have uttered them. Because Jesus' personality was complete, flawless, and without blemish, he dared to say "It is finished." The last sentence is about reunion: "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." The thought of the Heavenly Father permeated Jesus' entire life, so naturally, at this moment, he would completely trust in returning to the Heavenly Father. Now, let us temporarily set aside the other six sentences and discuss the first one: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." What significance does this sentence of forgiveness have for us, who are poor, weak, sinful, and full of sins? What significance does it have for this sin-filled world? An old man said that Jesus' teachings cannot stand because they are built on a cross, on the death of the leader, on a great disaster. How can it stand? Little does he know that the reason why Jesus' teachings have been spreading wider and wider for thousands of years is precisely because of this. (To be continued)

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 22: News Reports Fly in from Afar, Noble Discussions and Great Theories Are the Beliefs of Mankind

He Liyu said, "Sister Huihua! Look at every desk in this editorial office; there is a telephone. I think if all these telephones started talking at the same time, this editorial office would be very lively." Shao Huihua laughed and said, "That is an idealized imagination. How can there be telephones all talking at the same time? You are thinking of the direct-line telephones in foreign exchanges and banks, but those are overwhelmed from all directions. Here on the top floor, there is a wireless telegraph room, which receives all the important domestic telegrams. These telegrams are translated and sent down to the editorial department. As for the telephones on each person's desk, they are for special use. For example, in international affairs, if private individuals know something before the official documents are released, they can call the editorial department directly. Or if something is widely rumored but not actually accurate, they can explain the truth to the editorial department and tell us everything over the phone. Now that long-distance telephone services are available everywhere in China, if there is any important news in the country, our correspondents can make a long-distance call to the newspaper. China's transportation authorities also give special preference and assistance to the news industry, hoping that information will be especially fast. As for the local news department, if there is any news after midnight, it all depends on telephone reports. That's why the desks in the local news editorial department have so many telephones." Wu Junsu said, "Any news after midnight? For us, we go to bed at ten o'clock at the latest. In school, the lights are turned off at nine o'clock because everyone has to get up at six o'clock tomorrow. At twelve o'clock, we are already in deep sleep." Shao Huihua laughed and said, "Can the things in a newspaper office be compared to the things in your school? Needless to say, many international telegrams arrive in the middle of the night. Because the earth is rotating, the time is different in different places. Our night is daytime in the United States. Your school turns off the lights at nine o'clock, but people in the United States are still working. So if you want a piece of news that happens during the day in America to reach China immediately, wouldn't it already be in the middle of the night? As for local news! Shanghai is such a big city that it certainly has a night market, and the night market is also very late. Now, entertainment venues are already regulated and not allowed to stay open all night, but there are also people who work at night. For example, our newspaper office is a night job. Other factories are also working at night to rush orders. You say there is no news after twelve o'clock? You have to know that society is like a big machine, constantly moving day and night, and wherever there is movement, there is news. Besides, there are still three hours from twelve o'clock to three o'clock when the plates are made."

### Garbo in Lubitsch's Eyes: Waiting… Quiet… Simple

— Jia

Ernst Lubitsch has always admired Greta Garbo. After directing her in "Ninotchka," his understanding of her deepened. Here is what he said to people during filming:

"Since I started my directing career, I have had a lot of contact with movie stars. Each person has their own characteristics. For example, Miss Garbo has a characteristic: she doesn't like to work after five o'clock in the afternoon. However, she can start filming at nine o'clock in the morning without any haste. Because her performance is very skilled, she proceeds very smoothly with her work. Miss Garbo is so punctual that you can treat her like a clock."

"I think Miss Garbo is one of the quietest women I know. The quietest man in Hollywood is Gary Cooper. These two people never reveal their emotions. If you asked them to stand in front of a crowd and give a speech, it would be impossible."

"Generally, female stars apply a lot of powder during breaks in filming and spend a lot of time doing so, but Miss Garbo is different. Unless I tell her to, she never likes to look at her beautiful face in the mirror."

"The thing Miss Garbo dislikes the most is being rushed, so she doesn't like to work after five o'clock. The time after five o'clock is entirely her own."

### Roadside Willow and Wallflower: A Discourse on the Way of Husband and Wife, Worthy of Your Consideration

I remember seeing a movie starring Hu Die called "Roadside Willow and Wallflower." At the time, I didn't have much of a feeling about it. A few days ago, after reading Mr. Neichang's "Happy Family," I couldn't help but think of the issue of roadside willow and wallflower. I agree with Mr. Neichang's statement that so-called happy families under the old ethics are bitter water wrapped in sugar. Why is this so? Because in the old ethics, the husband's responsibility to the wife is to provide for her, and the wife's responsibility to the husband is to bear children. Think about how unequal and unreasonable this principle is. Whether or not a wife can bear children is not entirely her responsibility. Either the husband cannot have children, or there is a physiological incompatibility between the two. Does the blame always fall on the wife? It is unreasonable to blame the wife for something that is not her fault. Conversely, it is also a great fallacy to consider that the wife has fulfilled her responsibilities simply by giving birth, which is natural and not solely her effort. Therefore, the wife's responsibility to the husband is not childbirth, and the husband's responsibility to the wife is not just providing for her. The responsibility that both should fulfill towards each other is comfort; comfort in body and mind, and consolation of emotions. After work, everyone needs to be comforted. When the husband's income is sufficient to cover the family's expenses, the wife should manage the household affairs in an orderly, clean, simple, and frugal manner, without unnecessary waste, and save a little when there is a surplus, finding some proper entertainment. If the husband's income is insufficient to cover necessary expenses, the wife should help earn some money, and both should share the obligations of the family. On which side? When the wife is tired from managing the household, the husband should take her out to play, tell her interesting stories, or jointly study an art that interests them. I believe that the union of husband and wife does not depend on whether it is new or old. The maintenance of love depends on only two conditions: one is to provide for the other's needs, and the other is to be considerate of the other's emotions. The beautiful story of Liang Hong and Meng Guang raising their trays to their eyebrows was not because Liang Hong was rich and powerful or because Meng Guang was beautiful and enchanting. Therefore, even in a free marriage, if the union is based on one party's money and the other party's beauty, there will still be no good outcome.

### Huang Guiqiu and Others Arrive in Shanghai

— Jing

Gengxin's female performer Xin Yanqiu, Yu Zhenfei, and others performed until the 31st, when their term expired. The roles will be taken over by Huang Guiqiu, Ma Junwu, Zhou Weijun, Bai Qingxiang, and others. They arrived in Shanghai on the Shenjing ship two days ago. Gengxin sent staff to the dock to welcome them. Guiqiu's arrival in Shanghai is a return to a familiar place. She is staying at her friend Wang Yunsun's home. Weijun is temporarily staying at the Yangtze Hotel. Junwu, to facilitate practice, is staying with Bai Qingxiang in the backstage dormitory. That evening, the theater hosted a welcome dinner for them at Yuebin Restaurant, which is also a customary reception banquet.

Previously, Guiqiu traveled from Hankou to Shanghai to perform at the Tianchan Theater. After her term expired, she returned to Beijing. She has been away from Shanghai for ten months. This time, she is back, and her style is still the same. She is a direct descendant of Chen Delin, and her singing has a unique style. She also has considerable research in painting. One of her masterpieces, "Butterfly Matchmaker," features an on-stage butterfly painting performance. Many female performers are her disciples, including Wang Xichun on Xiaodao Island in Hong Kong, Jin Suwen in Carlton, and Zheng Bingru. Guiqiu's three opening acts have been scheduled as "Butterfly Matchmaker," "Si Lang Visits His Mother," and "Wang Baochuan," starting on the first of next month.

Ma Junwu is the son of Ma Chunqiao and the nephew of Ma Lianliang. He is one of the young and vigorous martial performers, and his style is completely different from Liang Huichao's. In the summer of the year before last, he came south with Lianliang in the same troupe and performed at the Golden Grand Theater. The audience has a considerable understanding of him. Zhou Weijun, the young male performer, was also one of the first members invited by Gengxin to come south. He has partnered with Wu Suqiu, Zhao Jinrong, Liang Yunqiu, Zheng Bingru, and others. His teacher is Jin Zhongren, who is as famous as Wang Yurong. Zhongren highly praises this beloved disciple and has said, "His performance of 'The Eight Great Hammers' is unparalleled in Beijing." This time, he may have the opportunity to show it off in Shanghai.

### Gu Eryi Is Not Dead

— Hua

The news of Gu Eryi's death seemed to be absolutely certain. The Lafayette Theater even held a morning performance of "Parasitic Grass" the week before last to raise money for Gu Eryi's family.

However, we recently received a letter from a friend in Chongqing stating that Gu Eryi, along with Bai Yang, Zhang Youping, Wei Heling, Shi Chao, and others, performed Yang Hansheng's play "Beyond the Great Wall" directed by Shen Xiling at the Chongqing Guotai Grand Theater on March 17th.

Although transportation between Chongqing and Shanghai is inconvenient, news about movies and dramas is often exchanged in personal letters. Yet, the "news of death" of Gu Eryi was spread so bizarrely, and even verified by the Gu family in Nantong! This is truly a strange piece of news.

Now it is definitely proven that Gu Eryi is not dead, which can be a comfort to his friends and audiences.

Old Tan's Extraordinary Cleverness (Part 2)

After the performance that day, according to custom, he should wait for the Emperor and Empress to grant gold and silver pellets and other rewards. However, due to a mistake of one word, Wei was not full, and they did not meet. Tan did not mind it slightly. He hurriedly returned to his residence after removing his makeup. His companions knew that Tan's temperament was eccentric, and no one dared to question him afterward. There was a certain actor from Shanghai who had a close friendship with Tan. After arriving in Beijing, he stayed at Tan's house. Driven by curiosity, the actor had discussed with Tan that day, asking to be dressed as a servant to accompany Tan into the palace to observe the scenery inside the forbidden area. Tan recited the four words "kill the pig, slaughter the cow." The actor heard them clearly. In the evening, when no one was around, he lay down next to the couch and privately asked Old Tan, "What happened to you today, sir? Why did you recite 'slaughter the cow' instead of 'slaughter the sheep'?" After listening, Old Tan only smiled and continued to play the flute. When he finished in one breath, he jumped up from the couch and gestured with his hand, saying, "Killing one sheep is enough to lose one's head! Moreover, this year is 'Three Sheep (Yang) Bring Prosperity.' I originally didn't want to sing this play, but the playbill added 'Catch and Release.' If I had recited the original words today, I would have committed a great act of disrespect. If someone pointed it out and explained it to the chief eunuch, would I still have my head?" After listening attentively, the actor realized that the Empress Dowager Cixi and Li Lianying were both born in the year of the sheep. This year happened to be the year of the sheep, hence the saying "Three Sheep Bring Prosperity." The next day, the actor told the others, and someone who wanted to curry favor with Li relayed Tan's words. Li was pleased with Tan's carefulness and alertness and praised him greatly before the Empress, doubling the rewards. Later, the actor returned to the south and constantly warned his peers, saying, "After all, the Beijing actors have received training. They often learn from scholars. Not to mention their study of words, they even know these taboos. They are afraid of violating the holy name. Compared to those who spout nonsense on stage, they are many times better." It is said that after this, the eunuchs managing the Southern Mansion in the inner court never again put "Catch and Release" on the playbill. Tan the Great King's extraordinary skills are enough to amaze people, and his extraordinary wisdom is also the greatest reason for his fame.
