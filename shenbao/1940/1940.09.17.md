### Fierce Air Battle in London the Day Before Yesterday: British Air Force Achieves Major Victory; British Official Report Claims 185 German Planes Shot Down; German Planes Continuously Attacked Again Yesterday Without Success

London - Yesterday's massive air battle was the greatest sacrifice made by the German Air Force in a month. Around 11 AM, approximately 350 to 400 German planes in two batches attacked London and the southeast of England. The first batch of 200 enemy bombers and fighters were divided into eight or ten groups, flying into the skies between Dover and Dungeness. At 1:15 PM, another ten groups of enemy planes, totaling 150 to 200, also flew over the coast. Smaller groups of enemy planes harassed the areas of Portland and Southampton in the evening, but British patrol fighters intercepted them each time. The two fierce battles over London were unprecedented. Spitfire and Hurricane British squadrons, mostly piloted by experienced aviators from London's air defense, flew out to intercept. The enemy planes turned back, and the British planes pursued relentlessly until the enemy planes flew over the English Channel. One squadron of Hurricane fighters destroyed nine enemy planes and then returned to London to search for more. Another British squadron shot down five enemy planes in pursuit. Some enemy planes that flew to the Thames Estuary were severely attacked by Hurricane British planes, with almost none surviving. Apart from five enemy planes crashing, the rest were also heavily damaged and fled in disarray. After the fourth air raid warning, enemy planes flew into the inner circle of London, but the barrage of artillery fire was deafening, and the enemy planes ascended and fled in the same direction, not daring to circle London.

A Certain Port in Southeastern England - Yesterday, an extremely fierce air battle occurred over this area. At least a hundred German planes, forming a strong formation, fought with British destroyers. German planes appeared over this area five minutes after the air raid alarm was issued, and were immediately met with deafening anti-aircraft fire from the British side. Although many anti-aircraft shells pierced directly through the German groups, the German planes were undeterred and continued to soar. After a few minutes, a large number of British fighters ascended and pounced on the German planes, scattering their formation and engaging in a fierce battle in the clouds. German and British planes could be seen darting down from the clouds from time to time, or ascending again while strafing with machine guns. It was reported that three German planes immediately crashed to the ground. The British fighters fought extremely fiercely, without a moment's pause, preventing the German planes from having a chance to drop bombs. One German aviator deployed his parachute and landed near here, unharmed. The sound of the air battle subsided after a long time. (United Press, 16th)

London - This morning, German planes again scattered bombs capable of causing death and destruction over London. The tension increased until 1 AM (9 AM Shanghai summer time). A hospital in London, which had been built for many years, was directly hit by a bomb, and the extent of casualties and damage was difficult to ascertain immediately. A reporter from the United Press was hit by shrapnel from an anti-aircraft shell on Oxford Street, wounded, and fled. While fleeing, he still heard four bombs falling nearby, but none of them exploded, seemingly being time bombs. Early this morning, German planes also visited many towns in the northeast, southeast, southwest, and central regions. (United Press, 16th)

London - Today, London was again subjected to air raids, with three alarms sounded before noon. The first two lasted about half an hour each. The third was issued at 11:12 AM and lifted 39 minutes later. At 1:12 PM, a fourth air raid alarm was issued again. Most of the German planes were driven back near the coast, and no fighting occurred over the London area. (Reuters, 16th)

London - Today, German long-range artillery positions along the French coast opened fire on Dover, injuring eleven people. The British side also returned fire. (Reuters, 16th)

Dublin - After a full night of bombing by German planes, the all-clear signal was not given in London until 5:36 AM this morning. The first air raid alarm was issued at 8:08 PM last night. The anti-aircraft fire was extremely intense throughout the night, causing all street traffic to come to a standstill, as shrapnel rained down, making it quite dangerous for pedestrians. Several places caught fire due to incendiary bombs. It is now believed that most of the bombs dropped at night were delayed-action types. Yesterday, the London area shot down three German bombers. (Reuters, 16th)

London - According to an official announcement, a total of 185 German planes were destroyed yesterday. The actual number of British planes lost was 25, as five of the 30 previously reported missing had safely returned to their bases, with all twelve crew members safe and sound. After 8 PM last night, German planes continuously invaded, incessantly throughout the night. The dense anti-aircraft fire network forced the enemy planes to evade. Three hospitals were hit, but only one sustained minor casualties. Buckingham Palace was bombed three times last night, and the extent of the damage is still unknown. The Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security issued a public statement saying that small groups of enemy bombers attacked London in shifts last night, causing damage to residences, shops, and other buildings. Three hotels have been bombed and damaged. Since last Saturday and Sunday, the German side has lost a total of 455 planes and 1,100 crew members, while the British have lost 101 planes and 57 crew members. (Reuters, 16th)

### Air Raid on Berlin

Berlin - An air raid alarm was issued in Berlin at 11:28 PM last night and lifted at midnight. No enemy planes dropped bombs. Berlin's anti-aircraft units did not open fire either. According to responsible sources, British planes were unable to fly near Berlin due to the interception by anti-aircraft units, nor did they drop bombs elsewhere. By 12:50 AM, the British planes had flown back to England. (Haitong, 16th)

### London Stock Exchange Prepares to Relocate

New York - The New York Times reported this morning, citing a dispatch from London, that British authorities are currently considering relocating the London Stock Exchange away from the British capital. (Haitong, 16th)

### German Air Force Uses New Tactics: Penetrates Anti-Aircraft Fire Network

London - Although Sunday's air raid on London resulted in heavy losses, the German commander continued to send bombers into London this morning to carry out immoral attacks on various targets. It has been decided that German Air Force personnel will change their tactics. Small teams of bombers, led by a team leader, will use gliding and circling methods at high altitude to enter the center of London. The German Air Force is now adopting closely linked and mobile groups of aircraft, charging in from all directions of the British capital, so that they can penetrate the fierce anti-aircraft fire network on the ground from the British side. The method of group bombing of London for the past week is no longer being used. This morning, German planes again flew into the skies over the suburbs of London, but only a few reached the center of London. London has now been subjected to four air raids, and Buckingham Palace has been bombed three times, fortunately without casualties. Buckingham Palace was hit by two bombs, both hitting houses and penetrating the tapestry room used by the Queen as a reception room. (International, 16th)

### German Planes Dart into London Area; Buckingham Palace Bombed Again

London - A joint public statement from the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security stated that a large number of enemy planes in two groups crossed the coast near Dover yesterday morning. British fighter squadrons immediately met them head-on and engaged in a fierce battle. Two small groups of enemy planes darted into the London area and dropped bombs. Buckingham Palace was hit by another bomb, but this bomb did not explode. Houses elsewhere in the London area were also hit, with some catching fire. Gas pipes and water pipes were all damaged. A high-explosive bomb that landed on St. Paul's Cathedral was removed by experts yesterday, so the streets that had been closed to pedestrians for several days have now been reopened. Shops can reopen today. It is now known that St. Thomas' Hospital in London has also been bombed recently. A Reuters aviation correspondent stated that the second week of the air battle over London has now passed, and the form of the German air raids has clearly changed. Sometimes single planes attack, sometimes entire squadrons are dispatched. General Goering, in view of the losses suffered by the German Air Force, has to rest temporarily while re-examining the squadrons, which is why single planes are sent out to maintain pressure on Britain. Although this does not fit in with his planned invasion of Britain, Goering has used most of his first batch of aircraft. It is conceivable that the German lightning war against Britain has not lasted two months, and the attempt to invade Britain has not yet been realized, but its air force has reached this stage. This is something that can make people happy. The defensive capabilities of the British fighters and anti-aircraft guns have been demonstrated. If the German side wants to invade Britain without gaining air or sea superiority, its failure is undoubtedly inevitable. (Reuters, 16th)

London - Up to 9 PM last night (6 AM Shanghai summer time), 175 German planes attacking Britain were shot down, breaking the previous record. London issued alerts four times yesterday, and Buckingham Palace was bombed for the third time, although it was hit by a bomb there were no casualties. Thirteen British fighters went missing, but ten pilots were safe and sound. The first alarm started at 10:51 AM and lasted for 65 minutes. Two bombs fell on Buckingham Palace, one hitting the palace tower and penetrating the Queen's reception room on the second floor, and the other falling on the lawn, neither of which exploded. At the same time, many small incendiary bombs fell outside the palace, and the lawn caught fire, but was quickly extinguished. At the time, the King and Queen were not in the palace, and only servants remained, sheltering on the lower floors, so there were no casualties. (Reuters, 16th)

London - Yesterday, the area of the air battle was extremely wide, stretching from London along the Thames to the British Channel coast. Two heavy incendiary bombs and sixteen incendiary bombs all fell on Buckingham Palace, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. As for the two heavy bombs, they did not explode. Witnesses here said that while attacking Buckingham Palace, after dropping the bombs, it was shot to pieces in the air by the British Air Force. Another German plane was damaged, and the pilot died because his parachute failed to open, falling on a rooftop. (United Press, 16th)

### German Military Headquarters Claims British Planes Lost 79

Berlin - According to a statement from the German military headquarters, German planes continued to attack London yesterday, bombing shipyards and harbors.

German planes attacked convoys near the coasts of Ireland, Scotland, and England, sinking two ships totaling 18,000 tons, one catching fire, and one heavily damaged. Another ship was sunk in the English Channel. German bombers raided Liverpool and Birmingham at night, causing fires in many places. British planes attempted to attack Berlin but failed. British planes bombed homes in western Germany, destroying several houses in a certain town, setting fire to a school, killing two civilians, and injuring several others. Anti-aircraft guns and destroyers shot down several British planes each. Coastal patrol boats shot down three. In total, the British lost 79 planes, and 43 German planes did not return.

Two water plants, one power plant, and one pumping station were all destroyed. Most of London has been turned into an uninhabitable area. The Portland naval base and the port of Dover were severely damaged, and large fires are erupting. According to unofficial sources, long-range cannons on the French coast are also shelling London, and two British cargo ships of 8,000 tons each were sunk last week. (International, 16th)

London - When German planes bombed London on the 11th of this month, a slow-action bomb fell near the world-famous St. Paul's Cathedral. Although the authorities have disabled the bomb, as a precaution, they have ordered nearby residents to evacuate and temporarily isolated the adjacent streets, so that worship services have also been suspended today, which has not happened for many years. (Havas, 15th)

London - The historic St. Paul's Cathedral was almost destroyed today, because a delayed-action torpedo bomb fell in the courtyard of the cathedral. A heroic soldier discovered it and moved it to a place where it could not cause damage to explode. The bomb was removed by Lieutenant Davis and his soldiers after three days of effort. (United Press, 16th)

Swedish Capital - According to the British Home Secretary's announcement, the heaviest bomb dropped by German planes in London weighed over one ton and fell near St. Paul's Cathedral, fortunately it did not explode. Its timing fuse has been removed, and the bomb will be disposed of in an open area outside the city. When the bomb explodes, the diameter of the hole it creates will be over one hundred feet.

British Planes Brave Storms to Bomb German Military Areas; Antwerp Docks Hit Hardest

London - Large squadrons of bombers from the Aviation Corps fiercely attacked enemy ships, military installations, and storage depots in the English Channel ports, as well as enemy supply distribution centers and transportation lines, inflicting heavy damage and systematically destroying the German High Command's invasion organization. British planes braved bad weather and fierce resistance from ground defenses to bomb Antwerp, Ostend, Vlissingen, Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne ports, warehouses in Mannheim and other places, and railway traffic in the Rhine and other places, hitting targets. The Antwerp docks were hit the hardest, and the Cap Gris-Nez battery and several airfields were also bombed. One British plane went missing. (Reuters, 16th)

London - According to the Intelligence Office of the Ministry of Aviation, British planes flew out in frightening weather, and were struck by lightning on the way. The electrically charged wind and rain were so fierce that the radio cables on the aircraft backs were burned off, and many aircraft surfaces were iced over. However, the British planes braved these difficulties and dangers, fiercely attacking the invasion "front line" along the coasts of France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and bombing German bases, railway junctions, and transportation centers. The most severely attacked area that night was Antwerp, "directly pointing at the heart of London." British planes flew on the city from 11 PM (Saturday) to 2:30 AM (Sunday), dropping about 40 tons of high-explosive bombs and over a thousand incendiary bombs, causing heavy damage to large docks, warehouses, gasoline depots, and ships. Many areas in the dock area were hit. The east and west areas were repeatedly bombed from all directions. One warehouse was hit and destroyed. Judging from the intensity of the explosion, it must have stored explosives. Large fires broke out, oil pools caught fire, and there were other kinds of explosions. Coal, iron sand, and stacking yards were bombed, and debris flew high. Part of the newly formed Polish bomber squadron participated in the attack and succeeded in bombing oil operations. At that time, cold air swept through the clouds, fog was everywhere, anti-aircraft guns were constantly firing, and searchlights flashed across the sky. The British planes, undeterred, identified each part of the port and found their targets, launching fierce bombings. The ships in the port of Calais and the surrounding searchlight teams were heavily bombed from 5:30 PM to 8 PM. About 300 barges in a certain shipyard were especially lost. The British planes also used the fires visible from 20 miles off the coast to fly to Dunkirk, braving fierce anti-aircraft fire and repeatedly dropping high-explosive bombs, hitting the shipyards directly. When British planes attacked Ostend, they discovered that the port's defenses had been greatly strengthened in the past week, but they could not prevent the British planes from attacking the large number of ships in the port.

Editorial

### Reviewing the Delineation of the Japanese Sphere of Influence in Vietnam

Regarding the Vietnamese issue negotiated between France and Japan, the resulting impact is extremely significant and far-reaching, and we cannot regard it as other people's affairs. Up until now, the exact content of the negotiations remains a secret between the two sides. Observing the ambiguity in the French statement, Pétain's weak attitude, and various external rumors, although extremely unfavorable to France, one cannot help but believe that the rumors are not entirely false. Yesterday, the German Haitong News Agency again transmitted a telegram from the Vichy side of France, claiming that the French-Japanese negotiations had been agreed upon in principle by the two countries' authorities; France would demarcate the Tonkin and Cambodian regions of Vietnam as the Japanese sphere of influence; other regions would still be maintained under French sovereignty, but Japan might impose some kind of control. This is also an unconfirmed message from French officials. The same report was made by other parties a few days ago; now it comes from Vichy and is transmitted by Haitong, making people even more concerned and subject to further review.

When discussing Vietnam, the general concept of people may not be very clear. Historically, it belonged to Chinese territory early on. During the Qin Dynasty, when the feudal system was changed to prefectures and counties, the area belonged to Xiang Prefecture. After the Five Dynasties, it became a kingdom by secession, but it always claimed to be a vassal and paid tribute. In 1885, it was carelessly abandoned by the corrupt Qing Dynasty and became a French colony. However, its appearance, beliefs, customs, and habits are still the same as those of China. Geographically, it is south of the three Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan, with an area of approximately 285,000 square miles, which is one-third larger than mainland France and more than 30,000 square miles larger than the total area of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. It borders the South China Sea to the east and Siam and Burma to the west, and controls the Gulf of Siam. Politically, the entire territory is divided into five parts: the northern part is called Tonkin, the eastern half of the central part is called Annam, the western half is called Laos, and the western half of the southern part is called Cambodia. Each of these four parts has its own small court and is a French protectorate. The eastern half of the southern part is called Cochinchina, which is a directly administered French colony. China may call it Annam or Cochinchina, but that is not sufficient to refer to the entire territory, so it is not generally called Vietnam, but France generally calls it Indochina.

Assuming that the Vichy telegram transmitted by the Haitong News Agency is credible, then it is known that what Japan wants to take as its sphere of influence is two of the five parts. Tonkin is in the north, bordering China, and includes all of its coastal defenses, Hanoi, Lao Cai, Lang Son. It has the best climate, the densest population, convenient land and water transportation, and abundant rice and coal production. It is the plain of Vietnam and the essence of the territory. Cambodia is the southwestern plain of Vietnam, bordered by Siam to the northwest, and its southwestern coastline embraces the Gulf of Siam. Agricultural and mineral resources are abundant and a prosperous source. The two parts of Tonkin and Cambodia are not connected, so why doesn't Japan mind its separation? An obvious reason is that it is the initial step in aggression, first making separate arrangements, and then swallowing the entire territory like a whale. And its current main reason for seeking the Tonkin region is to encircle the southwest of China; for seeking the Cambodian region, there is another great desire. In addition to its economic value, Cambodia has important military value. Taking Cambodia as a base: (1) further advances would be Siam; (2) crossing the Kra Isthmus would be the Indian Ocean; (3) across the sea, it faces the British Malay Peninsula, about 600 nautical miles from the British naval port of Singapore, known as the key to the Far East; (4) it would form Japan's best and most advanced frontline for land, sea, and air forces to the west; (5) it would trap the American Philippines in a large encirclement. As for the lower cultural level of the Cambodian people (i.e., the Khmer people) and the hotter climate of the area, these are the most suitable conditions for Japan to take as a colony. Just look at its failure to immigrate to China's Northeast provinces in the past two or three decades, which can serve as an accurate negative proof.

The so-called sphere of influence is commonly seen in the history of international politics, but there is no clear and fixed definition. It must be transferred according to supplementary specific conditions. As in this telegram transmitted by the Haitong News Agency, there is a phrase that "other regions will still be maintained under French sovereignty." This shows that after the two regions of Tonkin and Cambodia become the Japanese sphere of influence, the sovereignty of the two regions is no longer maintained by France, but will be transferred to Japan. The absence of sovereignty is imaginable. There is no doubt that this changes the current situation in Vietnam! In this regard, it is a method of taking the pearl and returning the casket, stealing the sky and changing the day, to only call this form a sphere of influence!

Why does the Vichy government abandon the territory in this way? Why does the German government pretend to be deaf and dumb? There is currently no accurate information available to explain. What can be imagined is that regarding such a far-reaching issue, what Vichy can gain or lose, at least, is tacitly approved by the German side. And the flexibility of Germany's attitude towards Japan must be proportional to the strength of Germany's confidence in defeating Britain: that is, the stronger the confidence in Britain, the more flexible the attitude towards Japan; otherwise, the opposite is true.

### Korean Restoration Army to be Established Tomorrow

(Chongqing) Korea has been annexed by Japan for 30 years. For the past 30 years, the Korean people's heroic struggle against Japan for freedom has never ceased. To further forge a Sino-Korean united front and strengthen anti-Japanese forces, the Korean Provisional Government, in accordance with the previously promulgated regulations on the organization of military organs, has established the General Headquarters of the Restoration Army, which has been approved by Chairman Chiang.

### Muslims Should Be Referred to as Hui Religious Believers

(Chongqing) Our country has always advocated the republic of five ethnicities: Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan. Among them, the Hui ethnicity is actually the Islamic religion. Like the Mongols and Tibetans, they have a fixed territory and a fixed political and religious system, hence they can be called Mongol ethnicity and Tibetan ethnicity. However, the Hui people are spread all over the country. Although there are more of them in provinces such as Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, everything about them, except for their religious rituals, is no different from the Han people. In fact, they are the same as believers of Christianity and Catholicism, so they can only be called Hui religious believers and cannot be called Hui ethnicity. In the past, this terminology has often caused ethnic problems, leading to estrangement and misunderstanding, which is a great pity. Although this phenomenon of estrangement has now been eliminated, if the name is incorrect, then the statement will not be proper. It is still necessary to fundamentally correct it. It is heard that the Executive Yuan, in view of this, intends to issue a general order to the whole country that, from now on, Muslims should be uniformly referred to as Hui religious believers and should not be referred to as Hui ethnicity.

### Fierce Air Battle Over Chongqing; Japanese Planes Bomb Western Suburbs of Chongqing; No Major Losses on the Chinese Side

(Chongqing) Today, Japanese planes bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing. This morning, Japanese planes used the clear moonlight to drop bombs in the western suburbs and the Xiacheng area. Chinese fighters scrambled to intercept them, and fierce fighting occurred over Chongqing. Yesterday, Chongqing was bombed four times during the day. Over twenty bombs fell on the northern bank of the Jialing River, the western suburbs, Nan'an along the Yangtze River, and the vicinity of Nankai University, setting over ten houses on fire. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

(Chongqing) At 00:50 on the morning of the 16th, several Japanese planes raided the city. At that time, the sky had light clouds, so the Japanese planes blindly dropped several bombs, all of which fell outside the city. An air raid alarm was issued in the city at 10:07 and lifted at 03:04. At noon, 68 Japanese planes in separate batches attacked Chongqing again. The first batch consisted of 24 planes, the second batch 9 planes, the third batch 17 planes, and the fourth batch 18 planes. When the Japanese planes approached the urban area, they were fiercely fired upon by the Chinese merchant shooting units. The Japanese aircraft formations scattered in confusion and flew in different directions, dropping bombs in the eastern suburbs south of the city and in various other locations. An air raid alarm was issued in the city at 10:12 and lifted at 13:33. (Dispatch of the 16th)

(Chongqing) On the 15th and 16th, Japanese planes harassed Chongqing in three separate waves, dropping bombs in the suburbs and outskirts of the city. The Chinese suffered no losses.

### Tominaga Returns to Vietnam from Tokyo; Will Continue Negotiations with Vietnamese Governor; Fu Carries New Instructions from Tokyo; Thailand Claims It Will Station Troops on the Malaysian Border

Hanoi: General Tominaga, the right-hand man of Japanese delegation leader Major General Nishihara, arrived here by plane from Tokyo today. According to Japanese sources, Tominaga will hold a meeting with Governor-General Decoux tomorrow. It is rumored that Tominaga is carrying new instructions from Tokyo, as the Franco-Japanese conference was at a standstill when he went to Tokyo last week. At the same time, reliable sources claim that, in order to avoid unfortunate incidents on the border, the Japanese army in Guangxi has withdrawn nearly 20 miles from the Vietnamese border. It is said that last week, the Japanese army crossed the border into Vietnam, but retreated immediately because the French authorities in Dong Dang took a firm stance.

### National Comforting Association Holds Autumn Festival Comforting Rally in Chongqing; Representatives of the People Present Flags and Respect to Chairman Chiang, Minister He Yingqin Receives the Flags on Behalf of the Association and Delivers a Thank You Speech to the Rally; Major Cities Simultaneously Hold Comforting Rallies

(Chongqing) The National Comforting Association held Autumn Festival comforting rallies in Chongqing and other major cities today, using the remaining funds from the gifts collected during the spring comforting campaign and other fundraising efforts, totaling one million yuan, as a grant for mooncakes for the soldiers at the front. At the same time, the Chongqing General Association also represented the people of the country in presenting flags and respect to Chairman Chiang and Minister He. The meeting was held this morning, presided over by Vice Presidents Gu Zhenggang and Ma Chaojun, who delivered speeches hoping that the will and strength of the military and civilians across the country would be concentrated, and that under the call of national supremacy and ethnic supremacy, they would strive for military supremacy and victory supremacy, and complete the tasks of resisting Japan and building the country. Then, representatives presented flags embroidered with "Savior of the Nation" and "Commanding with Precision," which were received by Minister He, who delivered a thank you speech. Since the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, Japan has devoted its entire national strength to invading China. Under the unified command of the Supreme Commander Chairman Chiang, the Chinese army has adhered to the established national policy and persisted in long-term resistance. In the past 38 months of war, through arduous struggle, loyalty and sacrifice, the Chinese army has become stronger and stronger in battle, and the Japanese army has become weaker and weaker in battle, sinking deeper and deeper into the mire. The manifestation of these slight achievements is due to the skill and precision of the Supreme Commander's command, as well as the sincere assistance of compatriots across the country. Our army is responsible for defense and is determined to save the country. Faced with this current national crisis, although we have exhausted our wisdom and loyalty, we have not been able to slightly save the situation. Much of our beautiful land is still in the hands of the Japanese, and we only feel ashamed and do not dare to accept the comfort of compatriots across the country for any merit or labor. However, we should sincerely accept the encouragement that we have received from our compatriots. From today onwards, we will follow Chairman Chiang's instructions of "no arrogance, no discouragement," and carry forward the spirit of renewed efforts and indomitable perseverance. We will fight to the end with all our blood and lives, in exchange for the perpetual life of the nation and ethnicity, and to strive for the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation and ethnicity. We will not rest until our goal is achieved. (Dispatch of the 16th)

### US Pacific Fleet Ready to Move Anytime, Anywhere; Defenses of Honolulu Impregnable; Military Projects Underway on Various Islands

Honolulu: As a result of the deteriorating diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States, the United States is working to defend the first line of defense in the Pacific with unprecedented determination. After four months of unprecedented exercises, the US Pacific Fleet has been quickly completed. Since April 3, the authorities have been extremely secretive about the general situation of the fleet. However, one thing that has not been kept secret is that the fleet is ready to move at any time and anywhere in the Pacific. Naval authorities have confidently declared, "Every ship in our fleet can rival any country in the world." They hope that the naval shipbuilding program will enable the country's navy to be on par with any combined fleet in the world. The US Army stationed in Hawaii is now maintaining an absolute advantage and is waiting with agility. Sentries are patrolling all important traffic and transportation lines day and night. The authorities have also established a plan for underground storage facilities on Oahu, but information about underground airfields has not been made public. If the Army and Navy departments agree, it is believed that this can be achieved. The basic task of the US fleet is to maintain the highest level of gunnery skills. Officials believe that, apart from Britain, the navies of other countries in the world are not as accurate in their shooting as the American sailors. Oahu is now storing large quantities of military materials. Unofficial sources say that the amount of ammunition stored there can enable the fleet in that area to wage a prolonged war. Naval supplies are now being heavily taxed to ensure a steady flow of motor oil and other supplies into Pearl Harbor to supply the more than 100 warships there. The local naval operations authorities never disclose information, but they often make secret deployments lasting two or three weeks. It is reported that aircraft carriers are frequently conducting "foreign patrols." No less than a million people are building naval and air bases on the central islands and Johnson Island, which shield Honolulu. They have established the initial work of establishing a base on Wake Island. The defenses of the Sumay base, at the southernmost tip of Honolulu, have also been greatly enhanced to cope with any eventuality. All of the above is no different from a wartime picture. The supervisors there admit that the defense itself is impregnable. The United States is sufficient to deal with any eventuality in the Pacific. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

New York: According to reliable British sources, US Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador to the US Lord Lothian, and the Australian Minister to the US will meet to discuss Pacific defense issues. (Haitong dispatch of the 16th)

### Remarks of Japanese Diet Member Kawanishi on US-Japan Relations: A Scathing Critique of Clumsy Diplomacy

Tokyo – According to Japanese Diet member Kawanishi, who has traveled to the United States several times, US-Japan relations have never been as tense as they are today, yet there is no reason for war between the two countries. In an article published in mid-September, Kawanishi reviewed the tensions between the two countries arising from the China Incident and the European War, stating that "the relationship between these two Pacific powers is not uncorrectable, and only requires that Tokyo and Washington engage in negotiations with a straightforward attitude." Kawanishi concludes that neither Japan nor the United States will gain anything from war. He says, "Even if the U.S. Navy could blockade Japan, it could not make Japan submit. Conversely, even if the Imperial Japanese Navy could invade the American Pacific coast from the Philippines and Hawaii, Japan could never advance into the American continent and occupy Washington. Therefore, a US-Japan war would inevitably become a protracted event. In my opinion (Kawanishi referring to himself), there is nothing in the world that would cause more severe losses to both the US and Japan than a protracted war between the two countries." Furthermore, according to Kawanishi, since the gradual progress of the European War to date, the number of people in the United States who advocate establishing an understanding with Japan has greatly increased. Regarding this point, he says, "Americans are different from the British. The British are a pragmatic people, while Americans are purely emotional. Therefore, it is easier to deal with them. The reason why Americans have recently become increasingly anti-Japanese is due to our clumsy diplomatic actions. The result of diplomatic failures has led them to point to Japan as an aggressive nation. If we can be candid, the United States might understand our intentions. Therefore, we must explain to them the true nature and purpose of building a new order in East Asia. We should also inform Americans that since the enactment of the U.S. Immigration Act of 1924, which has adopted a closed-door policy toward Japan, we have had no choice but to expand in Asia. In addition to this immigration law, Australia and Canada have various laws that made Japan realize that its interests in Asia only lie in pioneering Greater Asia." Kawanishi says that if we want to resolve relations, there are three major prerequisites: 1. The China Incident; 2. Japan-Soviet relations; 3. French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies issues. He says that the reason why relations have recently become strained is undoubtedly due to the China Incident. Therefore, when dealing with the China Incident, if we can reassure the United States and protect their interests in China, and guarantee the restoration of their commercial rights with China, the two countries' friction will naturally disappear. After resolving the China Incident, the first thing Japan should do is restore the vitality of the war-torn areas, and this task cannot be accomplished without foreign investment. European countries will generally not discuss this after making such great sacrifices. Asian countries also cannot provide us with economic assistance. Therefore, Japan should cooperate with the United States, and it goes without saying that it is imperative to maintain friendly relations with the United States." When discussing Japan-Soviet relations, Kawanishi said, "As a result of careful study of Japan-Soviet relations, it is clear that improving US-Japan relations is no less important. Approaching the US can also pave the way for Washington and Moscow to establish close ties." Kawanishi, while defending Japan's advocacy of the Monroe Doctrine in Asia, said, "In order to liberate the people of Asia from the oppression of Western powers, the US should oppose Japan's actions in the Far East. Regarding our policies toward Indochina and the Dutch East Indies, we should also be candid and explain them without concealment. In short, we sincerely hope that US-Japan relations can be resolved through peaceful diplomatic negotiations without resorting to force. For example, we should immediately engage in negotiations to allow the United States to export oil, iron, and other materials to Japan, while the tin, rubber, and other products of the Dutch East Indies can also be exported to the United States."

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on Stalled US-Japan Negotiations: Accusations of US Discrimination Against Japan

Tokyo – Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma, while meeting with reporters this morning, acknowledged reports that Ambassador to the US Horinouchi had protested to US Undersecretary of State Welles on September 13 regarding the US embargo on gasoline. It has been reported that Welles rejected the protest. Suma also stated that the Japanese side had lodged a protest with Washington four or five weeks ago regarding the US embargo on gasoline, considering it discriminatory and unfair to Japan. US Undersecretary of State Welles responded with a written note a week later. The spokesperson refused to disclose the content or nature of the US response. It was also reported that when Horinouchi and Welles met on September 13 to discuss several major issues, almost all outstanding issues between the two countries were touched upon, but none were resolved. When a reporter asked on what grounds Japan's protest was based, the spokesperson replied that the US action was discriminatory against Japan, as the US allowed the export of gasoline to Western Hemisphere countries while imposing an embargo on Japan, which was unfair. He acknowledged that the US had sufficient gasoline supplies and could produce gasoline in any quantity. He also stated that this action by the US ran counter to the free trade principles that Secretary of State Hull had vehemently advocated for many years. Japan has been fighting for the two major principles of free trade and equality of opportunity since the Treaty of Versailles, and we will continue to fight for them." Another German reporter asked whether Japan's protest was based on the possibility of US gasoline being exported to England. The spokesperson expressed his personal opinion, saying that many transactions between the US and England, such as the sale of weapons and ammunition to England, may involve violations of the neutrality laws.

Sofia – There is much attention here regarding Japan's recent establishment of a first-class embassy in Sofia.

### British Press Comments on Air War Situation

London – British newspapers commented at the end of the week on the air war of the past week. Their general conclusion is that the German air force, using the methods it used to crush the Polish, Dutch, Belgian, and French air forces, attempted to defeat the British air force as a prelude to invading Britain. Thus, they engaged in fierce attacks over the past week, but this effort has clearly failed. The British air force has not only not been defeated, but is stronger than before. The window of opportunity for invading Britain has now passed. The military correspondent for the *Sunday Times* stated that the German air force must now admit its failure for the first time. However, whether Hitler will persist in his invasion strategy remains to be seen. Garvin, the editor of *The Observer*, said that it would be madness for Hitler to launch a large-scale invasion of Britain without achieving air superiority. If Hitler intends to do so, he must risk a try this week. Tomorrow (i.e., Monday) is the full moon and high tide, but Hitler may not be able to do so in time. (Reuter dispatch, 16th)

Germany also spent nine months preparing before attacking France. Therefore, Germany will only begin the attack when it is confident of victory. Germany remained very calm during the war against France, allowing the winter to pass in order to prepare fully for victory in the coming year. Its policy will naturally be the same in dealing with the war against Britain. When the time comes and it is possible to exchange victory for a few sacrifices, it will launch the final attack.

### Further Talks on the European War (7): The Enormous Military Expenditure of Germany

Regarding the situation of Germany's military preparations, this newspaper has previously translated a report from a "New York Times" correspondent. Now, we translate and record the massive scale of German military spending as reported in the "Christian Science Monitor" below. Compared with the situation in France, they are worlds apart.

The total amount of German military expenditure is still difficult to estimate, but according to an analysis by the U.S. Department of Commerce at the outbreak of the European War, German military expenditure accounted for 47% of national income in the fiscal year 1938-1939. To date, this percentage has likely increased significantly.

Germany has already gone bankrupt internationally and is experiencing a severe lack of resources. How can it disregard economic and financial principles and exploit resources in this way?

Six years ago, Germany was extremely short of gold and foreign exchange, its credit was bankrupt, and it declared a suspension of all foreign debt payments. At that time, Hjalmar Schacht, then President of the German Reichsbank, constantly lamented Germany's dependence on foreign raw materials and appealed to the world for "compromise, tolerance, and goodwill." From a financial and economic point of view, Germany seemed to have reached the end of its rope.

However, within a few months, German Chancellor Hitler was accelerating a large-scale and costly military expansion plan.

Last autumn, he announced that he had spent 90,000,000,000 marks on expanding the military. This was hard for other countries to believe. At that time, it was difficult to calculate how much the German currency, due to its lack of gold backing and its inability to be freely bought and sold on the world market, was worth in U.S. dollars, but according to the officially stipulated exchange rate, it could be converted to $36,000,000,000.

The current amount of military spending in Germany is unknown, but its magnitude is undoubtedly enormous. British estimates suggest it requires $15,000,000,000 per year. Other estimates are even higher.

Economists explain that the principle of estimating wartime military expenditure based on peacetime economic standards is no longer applicable. In 1914, almost all economists agreed that Germany could only afford to wage war for a few months financially. But Germany spent as much as $186,000,000,000 in the last World War, excluding the loss of life, destruction of property, depreciation of capital, and loss of trade. It's seven times the total expenditure of the U.S. government from 1789 to 1916.

In modern warfare, ground forces must use mechanized units, and the skies must use aircraft. The cost will inevitably be much greater than in the 1914-1918 era. How can impoverished Germany carry out its adventurous campaign to conquer all of Europe? We trace back to the early days of the Nazi Party's rule.

At the beginning of his rule, Hitler discovered that 30% of German people were unemployed, factories were shut down, and the treasury lacked money to purchase essential raw materials and food. In such a crisis, the German people obediently accepted the system of control over industry, labor, trade, and finance, which was unprecedented in modern industrialized countries.

Similar control systems continue to be strengthened today. If you are a German, the government will tell you what you can eat, what you can wear, where to work, when to work, how much you can earn, and how much you should pay for your necessities.

If you are an industrialist, you will be told what to manufacture, what to sell, and the remaining profits after paying taxes should be lent to the government. If you run a savings bank or insurance company, you will be told where to invest your funds.

Until recently, the British government obtained the same overwhelming power from Congress. The centralization of power is a massive and detailed project that takes a long time. Hitler has been carrying out this plan for six years.

The funds that Germany currently uses for war are not only derived from huge taxes, not only borrowed from the people's savings controlled by the government, but also require strict sacrifices in people's lives.

In terms of food, one person can only eat one pound of meat per week. Apart from that, only cabbage and sweet potatoes can be eaten in limited quantities. As for clothing, each person is only allowed to buy a few items each year. The amount allotted to each person is even less than that of a Russian prisoner. Women are only allowed to wear four pairs of socks per year.

Economists explain that the entire strength of Germany has been mobilized for war. Repairs to factories, houses, and other institutions are put on hold if they are not related to war. Walther Funk, the current president of the Reichsbank, said in April that the production of consumer goods should be restricted, and merchants should limit investments in renovation. All savings should be easily accessible to the government from savings banks and lending institutions.

But besides intensifying domestic organization, Germany still has the problem of obtaining important raw materials from abroad. Among the three main raw materials of coal, iron, and oil, Germany can only fully supply itself with coal. Domestic production of cotton, wool, copper, rubber, and other major raw materials is lacking.

However, according to international trade experts, in the years before the war, Germany had already imported large quantities of resources each year, far exceeding its normal needs. In the early years of the Nazi Party's rule, all foreign trade was strictly controlled. The free trading of German currency on the world market was prohibited. American exporters could receive German payments but had to keep them within Germany. Exporters could use that German money to buy German goods, ship them to the United States for sale, and earn U.S. dollars.

But the exchange rate of the mark was not uniform and depended on the nature of the transaction. For example, the official value of the mark was set at 40 cents U.S. An American merchant who sold $40 worth of goods would receive 100 marks. But in some transactions desired by the government, each mark was only worth 20 cents U.S., so selling $40 worth of goods would yield 200 marks.

Even so, Germany's overseas supply problems are still seen by many economists and military experts as Hitler's weakest link. The supply of coal is certainly adequate. The supply of iron can be obtained in large quantities from Luxembourg and Sweden. The supply of food is also not a problem because Denmark and the Netherlands are under its occupation. The most problematic item is oil. According to international oil experts, even if Germany obtains all of Romania's oil production, the annual oil production of Romania, plus Germany's own small output and a small portion obtained from the Soviet Union, would only amount to the quantity produced by the United States in 20 days.

Therefore, most experts agree that, from both an economic and financial point of view, Germany's massive wartime apparatus and frantic actions will have difficulty overcoming the difficulties of winning. Apart from supply problems, some experts also acknowledge that there is the question of how long the German people can endure the sacrifices that the state forces them to endure.

### Serious Tragedy Occurs in the Chinese Military Concentration Camp in the French Concession Yesterday: Clash with Vietnamese Soldiers Results in Many Deaths and Injuries; Dispute at the Lone Army Barracks Still Under Negotiation

The conflict between the Lone Army Barracks in the Public Concession and the White Russian merchant group has not yet been resolved. Unexpectedly, a tragic dispute occurred in the Chinese military concentration camp in the French Concession yesterday. Vietnamese soldiers opened fire with machine guns and used water hoses to suppress the Chinese soldiers, resulting in more than twenty deaths and injuries on the Chinese side. The details are reported below:

Lone Army in the French Concession's Nanshi District

In November 1937, when the Chinese army withdrew from Shanghai, the soldiers and police in the Nanshi area who could not retreat were disarmed and taken in by the French Concession. They were detained in schools at various addresses, including Route Ratard, Avenue Joffre, and Route Saussoy. After successive releases, all members of the security team, special forces, and other units had been bailed out. The remaining approximately 960 people were soldiers from the 328th to 330th regiments of the 165th Brigade of the 55th Division of the Army. Their detention place was also concentrated at No. 16, Lane 388, Route Ratard. This place was originally the old site of the Weiyu Elementary School. After being occupied, the school moved to the former site of the Better Elementary School on Avenue Lafayette for classes.

Conflict Triggered by Food Issues

The French Concession authorities received 24,000 yuan per month from the Chinese government to cover the soldiers' food expenses. When soldiers were sick, they were sent to the Lao Jian Ti Yuan of the Guangci Hospital for treatment three times a week. The French Concession's surveillance of the camp was extremely strict, and there had been few incidents in the past. At around 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the soldiers in the camp clashed with the guards over the issue of side dishes, leading to mutual fighting.

Suppression by Gunfire Leads to Deaths and Injuries

Upon hearing the news, the French police sent eight trucks carrying approximately 30 Vietnamese soldiers to suppress the situation. The Vietnamese soldiers fired machine guns. According to inquiries by the Pingming News Agency, seven soldiers on the Lone Army side died, and more than 20 were injured. At the same time, traffic on the outside roads was cut off for three hours. The camp's chief representative, Zhang Guangzhi, was taken to the police station. According to another source, the dispute arose because the soldiers requested old wine and mooncakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival, leading to a conflict with the French officer due to disagreements. Vietnamese soldiers opened fire to suppress the situation, resulting in five deaths and eighteen injuries, some serious, among the Lone Army.

Official Announcement from the French Concession

The French Concession police issued an official announcement yesterday, stating that at approximately 12:30 yesterday afternoon, a large number of Lone Army soldiers in the Chinese military detention camp on Route Ratard suddenly attempted to escape and tried to break through the defense line of the French defense forces and police. Although the guards tried their best to dissuade them, it was ineffective. Therefore, the guards were forced to use weapons to drive back the crowd. It is reported that several people suffered minor injuries.

Western Newspapers Report on the Incident

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the unrest in the Lone Army Barracks in the Public Concession spread to the Chinese military detention camp on Route Ratard in the French Concession today (the 16th). French and Vietnamese soldiers stationed at the Route Ratard camp were suddenly attacked by Chinese soldiers in the camp and opened fire to suppress the situation. Afterwards, several injured Chinese soldiers were immediately treated in the camp.

Wire Mesh and Bamboo Poles Used as Weapons

It was found that the Chinese soldiers in the Route Ratard camp, who were the Nanshi garrison troops who retreated into the French Concession in 1937, suddenly used bamboo poles with barbed wire and other items as weapons to attack the guards and police in the camp. The French army urgently fired warning shots into the air, which were ineffective, and then shot at the Chinese soldiers in self-defense.

Authorities Investigate the Cause of the Incident

French officials told reporters that they did not understand why the Chinese soldiers suddenly launched the attack, as the Chinese soldiers had no complaints beforehand, and their food was quite sufficient. The number of injured Chinese soldiers has not been disclosed today, but it is believed that there were some who were seriously injured. After the incident, the French soldiers guarding the camp restored order, and the situation is now normal. The authorities are investigating the cause of the incident.

Dispute at the Lone Army Barracks

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," it is reported that after three days of disturbances in the Lone Army Barracks on Kiaochow Road, several representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps went to the camp this morning to negotiate a solution with Xie, the commander of the Lone Army. The Lone Army put forward a strong demand for immediate release. As of noon today, no solution has been reached. It is believed that the two sides will continue to negotiate this afternoon. The Lone Army soldiers are still furious.

The Municipal Council Will Take Appropriate Measures

This morning, the Shanghai Municipal Council made no statement regarding the negotiations. However, it is believed that after today's negotiations, the Municipal Council will decide on a plan for the future of the Lone Army and submit it to the board meeting on Wednesday for discussion. The Lone Army Barracks incident began last Friday when coolies from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department went to repair the football field gate. It was then agreed that the coolies would be allowed to repair it, but on the appointed day, the Lone Army soldiers still opposed it, leading to a conflict with the White Russian soldiers guarding the camp. Colonel Hohn, commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, personally went to the camp to seek a solution. It is rumored that the Lone Army also used force against Hohn, leading to disturbances that have not yet been resolved.

Searchlights Installed Around the Barracks

The security measures around the Lone Army Barracks became even more severe yesterday. Three White Russian soldiers were also stationed in the Kiaochow Park adjacent to the Lone Army Barracks. Yesterday afternoon, workers were seen installing seven 1,000-candlepower searchlights on the tops of the telephone poles around the Lone Army Barracks. The road connecting the Lone Army Barracks to the outside world was still blocked yesterday, so all goods and visitors could not enter. The telephone lines remained cut off. All the Lone Army soldiers ate only white rice yesterday. The Lone Army soldiers frequently showed their heads on the wall, revealing their anger. Since the clash between the Lone Army soldiers and the White Russian soldiers on the 13th, the camp has been under strict guard by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the Municipal Police. Several Lone Army soldiers and a small number of White Russian soldiers have not yet recovered from the effects of the tear gas thrown by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.

### Tomorrow is the 9/18 Anniversary: Citizens are Increasingly Loyal, Actively Promoting the Winter Clothing Donation Campaign; Security in Both Concessions Will Become More Strict

The ninth anniversary of the September 18th Incident is approaching. It has recently been ordered by the central government that the anniversaries of both August 13th and September 18th have been merged with the July 7th Festival and do not need to be held separately. All sectors of Shanghai society will focus on spiritual encouragement and actively promote the fundraising for winter clothing and savings campaigns, using them as meaningful commemorations. Furthermore, many Northeastern compatriots who have suffered since the start of the war of resistance have migrated with the army to various parts of the south, unable to return home and facing difficult circumstances. A campaign has been launched to save one day's income and remit it to the Northeastern Refugee Relief Association to provide assistance. The authorities of both concessions attach great importance to the security measures for September 18th and have implemented joint security measures since yesterday, with the defense forces of various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps deploying separately for patrol and prevention.

Security Tightened, Curfew Strictly Enforced

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that in preparation for the 8th anniversary of "September 18th," the concession authorities have tightened security since yesterday to prevent the occurrence of unfortunate incidents. However, crime in the urban area was visibly calm yesterday, as it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and government offices, banks, and various organizations were closed for the holiday, making the scene in the bustling commercial district quite different from usual. Although yesterday passed peacefully, both concessions continued to maintain security and continue to implement the prevention measures that began at the beginning of this month. Since the 18th is the anniversary of the "Mukden Incident," both concessions have tightened security since last night. In addition to the police, the garrisons of various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will participate in the prevention procedures starting this morning. The curfew in both concessions will also be strictly enforced from last night. It is rumored that all nightclubs in the urban area will be ordered to temporarily close on the eve of the "September 18th" anniversary, and police leave will also be suspended.

### Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival: All Sectors Generously Donated, Promoting the Winter Clothing Fundraising Relief Campaign; Military Donations All Changed to Winter Clothing Contributions

Yesterday was the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival. The silver and money industry, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the post office, customs, and various public groups and factories were closed as usual. Citizens were unable to avoid the customs of the festival, but there was also a strong response to saving money to support the winter clothing donation relief campaign. According to reports from the Xin Sheng News Agency, various charities such as the Refugee Relief Association, the Charity Federation, and the Child Welfare Association, as well as various agencies collecting winter clothing contributions, received a large number of donations. Although the business of tea houses, dry goods stores, and vegetable markets was still brisk during the Mid-Autumn Festival, those in the industry said that it was no longer comparable to the past. Sales volume had decreased significantly, reflecting the high prices and weak purchasing power of citizens. Furthermore, military donations for the Autumn Festival were all changed to winter clothing contributions to unify the effort.

Central Bank Open as Usual

The members of the Silver and Money Industry Association, as well as the bank reserve money industry reserve, and the member banks of the Foreign Banks Association, were all closed for the Autumn Festival yesterday. All receipts and transfers during the holidays will be handled after the market opens on the appointed day. However, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank was open as usual. As for the various industry markets such as gold, securities, yarn flowers, beans, rice, miscellaneous grains, cotton cloth money exchange, and foreign exchange, the markets were closed as usual yesterday and will open for trading starting today (Tuesday). Furthermore, some factories and businesses closed down and took a holiday for the Mid-Autumn Festival to handle ordinary settlements.

Unpredictable Profits and Losses in Various Industries

The abnormal development of various industries in Shanghai is a thing of the past. Since the beginning of summer this year, freight transport on various routes has stopped, leading to unusual stagnation. The profits earned in the past have been lost in almost all cases, and factory inventories have piled up, with actual sales greatly reduced. Therefore, this year's Mid-Autumn Festival is very different from previous years. Fortunately, various industries have tried their best to manage and barely made it through the festival. However, there is hope that the market will improve after the Mid-Autumn Festival. We fear that problems will arise at the final summary in the future. All firms and banks allowed extensions for Mid-Autumn Festival loans at the request of various industries.

### Bethel Church in Ningbo Bombed by Japanese Aircraft

The Bethel Church in Ningbo, located on Caowu Road, was suddenly bombed by Japanese aircraft on the 9th of this month. According to reports, a total of one bomb fell on the church, one at the foot of the front wall, destroying several tiles. The other fell in the back courtyard of the dining hall, destroying a hole in the ground. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries. The church has now reported the detailed incident to the General Assembly.

### Ferry Carries Passengers, Communication to Yunnan Restored

Taisheng and Taiyuan to Sail to Haiphong Tomorrow: Yunnan-Vietnam Passengers Restricted to Carry Luggage But because communication to Kunming has been suspended, all passengers going to Yunnan have hesitated. Therefore, the passenger loads on ships going to Haiphong, such as the Taikoo Company's Suzhou ship that sailed on the 8th of this month and the Jardine Matheson Company's Mingsheng ship on the 12th, were not crowded. This was due to the interruption of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. According to a telegram from

Lao Cai, communication to Yunnan has now been restored. Although the railway bridge destroyed between Lao Cai and Hekou has not been repaired, passengers can be ferried back and forth by barge. Passengers traveling from Haiphong to Yunnan can also purchase through tickets. However, the maximum amount of luggage that can be carried is 40 kilograms, and it must be carried by the passengers themselves. The railway will absolutely not allow luggage to be checked in and transported on behalf. Furthermore, due to the tense situation in Vietnam recently, the Hekou Governor's Office has been conducting strict inspections of foreign

Immigration Passengers. Passengers departing from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places for Yunnan, regardless of gender, must have identification certificates from their respective service companies, customs, or groups, schools, etc. Otherwise, they must be allowed to proceed after verifying that there are no errors. Recently, ships sailing from Shanghai to

Haiphong include Jardine Matheson Company's Taisheng and Taikoo Company's Taiyuan, which will sail on the 18th of this month. The next departure is the Taikoo Company's Hengyang on the 21st. According to reporters, seats on the ships going to Haiphong are heavily booked, all because communication to Yunnan has been restored.

### Chinese Army Chen Yaozong's Unit Fights Bravely Against Japanese Army, Obtaining Many Spoils; Even Attached Zhang Songhai Killed in Action

The Chinese army guerrillas led by Chen Yaozong, operating in the areas of Wujiang, Qingpu, and Kunshan, are very active. They have repeatedly engaged the Japanese army and inflicted severe blows, achieving significant results. On a certain day, the Japanese army gathered troops stationed in Jiaozhi, Chenmu, Wujiang, and Tongli to search the Longjing Hospital, but found nothing. They then retreated to the Chensi area to attack. Regiment Commander Chen led his troops to resist, and the two sides fought fiercely for two and a half hours. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses, and only the Second Company of Chen's regiment suffered slight damage. Furthermore, the Japanese army dispatched troops stationed in Zhujiajiao, Jiaozhi, Chenmu, and other places on the previous day, traveling on three motorboats and five civilian boats. At 9 o'clock in the morning, they suddenly attempted to approach the Chiji Bay. The Fourth Company of Chen's regiment

Reported the attack and launched a pre-emptive strike. The Seventh Company detoured to cut off the Japanese army's retreat, attacking them by surprise. The entire Japanese army was surrounded. The battle lasted until after 1 p.m., when the Japanese army was defeated by the Chinese army. The three motorboats escaped to the north, and the five civilian boats were captured by the Chinese side. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered great losses. The Second Battalion and First Battalion of Chen's regiment also encountered the Japanese army stationed in the City God Temple in Zhouzhuang. Due to the terrain, the Chinese army fought bravely and fiercely for five hours. The Japanese army was cut off by the Eighth Company of the Chinese army and retreated in panic. This battle was very fierce. Company Attached Zhang Songhai was brave and skilled in combat, leading from the front. He eventually died in action due to being hit by too many bullets. Regiment Commander Chen Yaozong personally led a strong force on a certain night at 11 o'clock, attacking the Japanese defense area in the southeast, west, and north of Chenmu Town in multiple directions. The Japanese army fled in droves, completely demoralized. The Chinese army captured one steamship and many other spoils.

### Yushan Waters - German Ship Detained - Released Last Night Via Telegraph

The Hai Yi, a ship managed by the German firm Tongtai Feng Yanghang, has been sailing to ports such as Songmen, Xiushan, and Qushan near Shanghai for about a month. The ship recently departed from Shanghai on the 11th and arrived at the aforementioned ports. Originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 14th, it had not yet arrived by yesterday. A reporter from the Datong News Agency inquired at the Tongtai Feng shipping office on Wuma Road and learned that the ship, while returning from Xiushan to Shanghai on the 13th, was ordered to stop for inspection by a Japanese warship in the waters off Yushan. However, as of noon yesterday, the Japanese warship had not sent troops to board and inspect the ship, preventing it from continuing its journey and effectively placing it under surveillance. At 7 p.m. last night, the Datong News Agency reporter inquired with the company again and was informed that they had received a telegram from the shipowner stating that the ship had been inspected and released to return to Shanghai, and was expected to arrive today.

### British Auxiliary Ship to be Dismantled in the Far East - Replaced by "Daxing"

The British Royal Navy's auxiliary ship "Hehua" of the Far East Fleet, with a displacement of 1,200 tons and equipped with two four-inch guns, served in areas such as the Dardanelles, Black Sea, and Red Sea in the United Kingdom. In 1927, it was transferred to the British Far East Fleet. Built in 1916, the British Admiralty decided to dismantle it in the Far East, considering it had served in China for over a decade and exceeded its service life. After the dismantling, it will be replaced by the "Daxing" for service in the Far East.

### 100,000 Tons of Coal to Arrive in Shanghai This Month

A large quantity of 100,000 tons of bituminous white coal has already been shipped from its production area and is expected to arrive in Shanghai within half a month to meet market demands. In addition, sporadic shipments continue to arrive at a steady pace. As autumn approaches and consumption is expected to increase, various coal businesses have stockpiled considerable quantities in preparation for selling them during the winter season. Regarding the sale of subsidized coal briquettes, despite various sectors requesting its continuation after its suspension, the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association has yet to make any statement or convene representatives from member manufacturers to discuss concrete measures. It is reported that Yizouxing and other coal briquette factories strongly support the subsidized sale of coal briquettes.

### Japanese Arrest Two Chinese in the French Concession Yesterday

Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, several plainclothes Japanese personnel, traveling in two cars, went to the French police station and, together with officers dispatched from the station, first searched a residence at No. 186 Xujiahui Road for about an hour before leaving. It was reported that the residents of that address had moved out beforehand, so nothing was found. Subsequently, they went to No. 1943, near Tushanwan on the same road, and arrested a man in his thirties wearing Western clothes. It was later learned that the man's name was Shen Shikui. Finally, they arrested another person at a residence near the intersection of Route Doumer and Route Courbet, but due to tight security, their name could not be ascertained.

### Mexico's National Day Yesterday

Yesterday was Mexico's National Day. The Mexican Embassy on Avenue Joffre and the Consulate General on Jiangxi Road were both closed for the holiday and flew their flags. Mexican expatriates in Shanghai also held celebrations to commemorate the occasion.

### Another New Hurricane in the Pacific Ocean - No Official Announcement from the Observatory

According to information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, another new hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean. As it is still far from Shanghai, the observatory has not yet made an official announcement. The hurricane is currently located southeast of the Ryukyu Islands and is moving northward, but its future direction is uncertain.

### British Government Issues Interest-Free Loans - Repayment Three Months After the End of the War - Sympathizers of Britain Hope to Help Generously

With the increased intensity of German air raids on London, the capital of England, the extent of the damage suffered has also become more widespread than in the past. British expatriates in Shanghai, after hearing the appeal from the Mayor of London last Wednesday, have been enthusiastically donating funds to help the families of those affected. The first batch of the "Air Raid Relief Fund," amounting to 2,500 British pounds, has already been remitted to the mother country. The second batch of donations will also be remitted to Britain in the coming days. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the British government recently announced the issuance of

Interest-Free Public Bonds. Those who are willing to lend funds to the British government without requiring interest during the war can send their contributions to the British Treasury within their means. The Treasury will issue receipts and send them back to the lenders. The loan is to be repaid in full three months after the war ends. Another method is suitable for smaller loans, which can be deposited with the Postal Savings Bank, with the

Interest Donated to the British Government. Those who can only offer short-term loans should notify the British Treasury before making the deposit. It is reported that the British government hopes that British expatriates in China will actively participate in this initiative, and also hopes that others who sympathize with the British government will lend funds to the British government.

### Rampant Damaged Banknotes - Exchange Them as Much as Possible - Can Be Directly Exchanged at the Four Banks - Do Not Exchange at a Discount Out of Ignorance

Since the Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) restricted the flow of new legal tender into occupied areas to prevent counterfeiting, the occupied areas are now flooded with old banknotes. Regarding the exchange of damaged banknotes, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Four Banks that damaged banknotes that meet any of the following conditions will be exchanged at full value: (1) the damage is minimal, and more than three-quarters of the banknote remains; (2) although split into pieces, the pieces can be matched; (3) soiled or scorched but the signatures, numbers, text, and patterns are still identifiable. Damaged banknotes with less than three-quarters of the original remaining will be exchanged at half value. However, (1) those that cannot be identified due to being burned, flooded, stained with oil, or painted over; (2) those with less than half of the original remaining; (3) those pieced together that cannot be matched; (4) those deliberately cut, dug, painted over, or with one side removed; (5) unusable banknotes such as sample notes or canceled notes, will not be exchanged. It is reported that the Shanghai branches of the Four Banks have been ordered to handle the exchange of damaged banknotes in accordance with the above procedures. Anyone holding damaged banknotes can directly request exchange at the Four Banks and should not exchange them at a discount at money exchanges or cigarette shops to avoid losses.

### News Briefs

Group Return to Hometown - The Wenzhou Association in Shanghai previously initiated a group return to their hometown. More than two hundred fellow villagers registered to go. The association originally scheduled the departure on the 4th of this month, but the journey was postponed due to road blockades. It is now learned that although there are ships traveling on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route recently, they are intermittent and not smooth, so this plan has been temporarily abandoned.

Rickshaw Licenses - The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession announced that the rickshaw pullers licenses are about to expire, and is now issuing a notice setting a deadline for renewal.

### Bus Robberies Abound - Gangsters Increasingly Rampant During Mid-Autumn Festival - Notorious Courtesan Loses Valuable Diamond Ring

The Zi Lin Daily reports that armed robberies on buses in the western district near the Chinese district are becoming increasingly common. Recently, due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, the gangsters have become increasingly rampant. Yesterday (the 15th), they even robbed passengers on a bus in the central district. The incident occurred at 8:35 p.m. last night. A Route 4 bus was traveling along Bubbling Well Road near Park Road. At that time, there were fewer passengers than usual. Suddenly, a Chinese man, Rui Yi, was threatened by a thief, who stole a diamond ring worth 300 yuan. When the bus stopped, the three robbers calmly got off the bus and fled.

Valuable Diamond Ring Stolen and Case Solved

The famous prostitute Lin Xiaoyun, known as "Old Eight," who advertised in Yuli, is 31 years old and originally from Zhenhai, Ningbo. She was once a concubine of Fan Shaoliang, the former president of the Five Hua Bank. Recently, she became involved with the gambling den owner Gao A'gen and now lives at No. 76 Limei Road. In March of this year, her employed maid Wu Wangshi (32 years old, from Yangzhou) suddenly stole a seven-carat diamond ring, a gold watch chain, and gold rings, totaling over 22,000 yuan, and fled without a trace. Until the day before yesterday, the French police dispatched detectives to apprehend Wu Wangshi. Yesterday, she was escorted to the Special Second Court, where Judge Zhu Chuzhe presided over the Eighth Criminal Court for questioning. The police lawyer requested an extension because the investigation was not yet complete. The court ruled that the defendant be remanded in custody and the trial be adjourned to the 25th.

### Xu Chongdao General Store Employees Request Improved Treatment - Store Reports to Police

According to the Xu Chongdao Employees Organization, Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store on Avenue Edward VII and its thirteen branches have reportedly made considerable profits since the war, but have not increased employees' salaries (the original salaries were a minimum of six yuan and a maximum of fourteen yuan). A total of more than 380 employees are hired. Due to the soaring prices of goods, the employees can hardly make ends meet. Representatives from each store were elected and jointly decided to propose eleven demands for improved treatment, including a minimum salary of twenty yuan per month, a salary of sixteen yuan for senior clerks, and a request for an additional fifteen yuan for rice allowance and a uniform monthly allowance of five yuan. Because the employer did not negotiate, they reported to the police and sent officers to suppress them. The employees now believe that requesting improved treatment is their right. In addition to preparing a document requesting the Shanghai Municipal Council Political Department to uphold justice, they also hope that the employer will understand the employees' suffering and agree to their demands. Otherwise, the employees, driven by the need to make a living, will have to request that people from all walks of life provide sympathy and assistance from a fair standpoint.

### Foreign Sailor Drowning Case - Vendor Accused of Murder

On March 24th of this year, a foreign sailor from the American ship Bilo purchased a small suitcase from Shao for the price of 70 cents in American currency. Shao followed him to the sailor's cabin to collect the money. Unexpectedly, another sailor, Yarov Nilin, in the cabin was pushed and fell into the Huangpu River and drowned. The river patrol police arrested the main suspects, Shao Mingcai and Yuan Jinsheng (both vendors), while the others reportedly fled. Shao and Yuan were sent to the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, where Judge Zhang Mingsheng presided over the case. The two defendants hired lawyer Zhang Shiben to defend them. Because there was a question of jurisdiction in the case, the court submitted it to the Supreme Court for designation of jurisdiction. After the Supreme Court ruled that the Special Second Court had jurisdiction, the hearing continued yesterday morning. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi prosecuted the two defendants for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. When questioned, both defendants denied the charges. According to witness Qin A'er, Yarov Nilin usually rode in my sampan, but on that day, he rode in someone else's sampan, so I don't know about the dispute. Another witness, Chen Shou, said that his sampan was next to the ship that Yarov was riding in on that day, so I saw the two defendants arguing with Yarov, but I did not see how Yarov fell into the river. The court ruled that there was no significant evidence of the two defendants' guilt and that other witnesses must be summoned, so the hearing was adjourned to 9:00 AM on the 20th. The two defendants were remanded in custody.

### Tram Company to Reduce Tram Accidents

Recently, accidents have occurred frequently on trams in the two concession areas of this city due to ticket conductors failing to close the tram doors and pulling the bell to start the tram, resulting in passengers who were still boarding falling and being injured or killed. A reporter specifically addressed this issue to the tram company authorities yesterday. According to them, the company authorities have already

punished the negligent employees, and the judicial authorities have sentenced them to the appropriate penalties. Subsequently, they

ordered all subordinates to ensure that passengers have completely boarded and have their tickets before pulling the bell to start the tram, in order to avoid endangering passengers. However, since the population has increased sharply, every tram is crowded, and passengers rush to board as soon as they see the tram arriving at a stop. Even if the tram is already overcrowded, they still push to board. Although the ticket conductors loudly advise them to take the next tram, it is ultimately ineffective, leading to tragic accidents. It is hoped that passengers will board and alight in an orderly manner in the future, and if the tram is full, do not

board.

### Kidnappers Punished Separately

Kidnapper Yan Zei Ru Buquan, also known as Peng Guangyuan, was previously a detective in the French Police Department but was dismissed due to an incident. On the morning of June 30th of this year, he gathered accomplices to kidnap Jiang Beihai, the accountant of Yongyu Coal Company at No. 2, Lane 475, Route Paul Henry. After the incident, the French Police Department arrested Bu and accomplices Hao Jinlin, Fang Donglin, Jiang Guiqing, Wang Ahua, and suspect Jiang Yongjin, and escorted them to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention. Because Jiang Yongjin was not involved in the case, he was not prosecuted. Bu and the other four defendants were prosecuted for kidnapping for ransom. During the trial, Bu died in custody due to illness. Hao and the other four defendants' final trial concluded, and yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Mingsheng sentenced Hao Jinlin to seven years of imprisonment, Fang Donglin to eight years of imprisonment, and each was deprived of public rights for the same term as their imprisonment. Jiang Guiqing and Wang Ahua were each sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, and each was deprived of public rights for three years. Bu Guangquan's case was dismissed. The defendants were transferred to the detention center.

### Stepmother's Son Accused of Embezzling Common Property - Sun Yingkang Devoured Father's Inherited Public Accumulation Fund - Sister-in-Law and Nephew Sue for Disposition - Ruling Orders Further Review

Sun Jinting, a native of Wuxian, Jiangsu, accumulated a substantial fortune through business and managing his household. In addition to real estate, city houses, and land worth more than 400,000 yuan, movable property included cash, gold bars, silver ingots, antiques, calligraphy, paintings, and securities, worth approximately 600,000 yuan. During his lifetime, Jinting married four wives successively and had a total of seven children: Xiaokang, Dekang, Xuankang, Yingkang, Yuankang, Lekang, and a daughter Youfen. Except for Yuankang, who died early, the others were all

married and established.

After Jinting passed away, all of the inheritance was managed by the youngest wife, Fang, and her son, Yingkang. Recently, Sun Chen Zhenji, the daughter-in-law of the eldest son Xiaokang, acting as the legal representative of her children, Sun Jingmei and Huangi, hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court against her brother-in-law, Yingkang, for embezzlement under Article 210 of the Criminal Code and Article 335 of the same code, alleging

embezzlement of common property.

The points of the alleged crimes included concealing accumulated public funds over the years and appropriating them for himself. During the distribution of assets to each branch of the family, a portion of the assets was proposed to be used as a public accumulation fund. The use of this public fund was intended to provide assistance to each branch of the family when encountering weddings, funerals, inability to maintain a living, or to pay for educational expenses. However, the defendant seized the public funds and never provided assistance to anyone, which clearly

indicated intent to embezzle.

Furthermore, the 50,000 yuan in cash, 200 taels of gold bars, and silver ingots, antiques, calligraphy, paintings, and porcelain inherited from Jinting were also secretly deposited by the defendant in his capacity as the head of the Shanghai Yongheng Bank, with funds transferred from the Shenyu Qianzhuang in Suzhou. He also forged an agreement with Madame Fang to undervalue the public property and illegally dispose of it to benefit his children. They requested the court to punish him according to the law for the aforementioned crimes. The First Special Court previously summoned them for questioning and ruled for an adjournment for a further hearing.

### Hou Yunqing Prosecuted for Assaulting a Woman He Was Pursuing - Fined as a Warning

Hou Yunqing, the medical director of the Zhaofeng Sanatorium and a native of Tongzhou, runs a clinic above the Huaying Pharmacy. Wu Yeqi, a wealthy woman from Suzhou, hired Hou to treat her illness. Hou took advantage of his professional position to pursue her, taking her to various gambling venues, causing her to incur significant debts. When Yeqi's mother learned of this, she prevented Hou from harassing her daughter and forbade her from associating with him. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of last month, Hou lured Yeqi to his clinic again. When Hou's advances were rejected, he assaulted Yeqi, causing injuries. Yeqi immediately reported this to the police, and the medical report confirmed the injuries. After unsuccessful mediation by friends, Yeqi filed a private criminal lawsuit against Hou for assault with the First Special District Court. Judge Fang Qinghuan presided over the Fourth Criminal Court for the hearing. Both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court with their lawyers. After Judge Fang questioned them, he found the defendant Hou Yunqing guilty of assaulting the plaintiff and immediately sentenced him to a fine of thirty yuan as a warning.

### Business Youths Leave Jobs to Join the Military

Four young men from this city, Xu Qingyu, Gu Minglie, Sha Zizhao, and Zhang Yong, previously worked in the business sector. Due to their fervent patriotism, they left their jobs together to join the military. On the 9th and 13th, they secretly went to the mainland to join the army. It is reported that Mr. Xu was originally scheduled to marry Miss Shi at the beginning of winter. His fiancée, Miss Shi, had tried her best to stop him beforehand, but he was deeply concerned about saving the country, disregarding personal feelings and making this heroic move, which is admirable.

### Fire at Canvas Shop - Shop Owner Highly Suspect - Maliciously Plotting to Obtain Insurance Money

On the morning of the 7th of this month at 9:15 AM, a fire broke out at the Taichang Canvas Shop at No. 225 Tokyo Road. It was caused by apprentices Shi Zibing (from Ningbo, 17 years old) and Xin Afa (from Jiangbei, same age) carelessly handling turpentine, white wax, and other materials while drying and applying paint. As a result, apprentice Xin Afa and Chen Youfa's six-year-old daughter, Mei Jiao, who lived upstairs, were both burned to death. The concerned officers from the Gordon Road Police Station arrested Yuan Bingzheng, the shop owner from Ningbo, and sent him to the First Special Court for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Third Criminal Court conducted a trial. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that, after investigation, the Taichang Canvas Shop had a fire insurance policy of 6,000 yuan. The cause of the fire was that the defendant and a Zhou surname shareholder who was on the run had instructed the two apprentices to dry and apply turpentine, white wax, and gasoline, all of which are flammable materials. This work was previously done by the Zhou surname shareholder, but now they suddenly had these two young apprentices do this dangerous work, with bad intentions and the possible intention of causing a fire to claim the insurance money. When questioned, Yuan Bingzheng's testimony was evasive, and he pleaded for leniency. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody and the investigation to be continued in detail. The request from Lawyer Zhang to re-test the process of heating flammable materials in an iron pot on a coal stove in order to clarify the truth was approved.

### Special Second Court Burns Contraband

The contraband and gambling paraphernalia confiscated by the Jiangsu Second Special District Local Court from July 1st of last year to June of this year were publicly burned yesterday afternoon as the 26th such event. Representatives from the Higher Second Branch Court, Higher Third Branch Court, First Special Court, and Second Special Court, and the Law Enforcement Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession Police Department were all present to supervise. The burning was completed at around 6:00 PM.

### Zhenye Silk Weaving Factory Reduces Production Volume

The Zhenye Silk Weaving Factory on Rue du Consulat in Hongkou, which previously had more than 200 weaving machines and operated day and night, still felt that supply could not meet demand. Now, it has been reduced to just over 20 machines, and its silk products still lack customers. According to the person in charge of the factory, the reason is nothing more than the interruption of domestic and foreign sales channels and the inability to compete with foreign companies. It is also learned that the cotton textile industry, although not as prosperous as in previous years, is still in better condition than other industries. However, the factories that are currently barely operating have all reduced their scale and production.

### Cultural Painting and Calligraphy Association Preparing for Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition

It is expected that the event will be a grand spectacle with a dazzling array of art.

### Recent Situation of Northeastern University Moving to Ertai

Northeastern University is quite stable in Santai. In terms of food alone, the monthly food cost is eight yuan, and the two meals, lunch and dinner, often maintain a record of four dishes and one soup, two meat and two vegetables. The atmosphere of studying at Northeastern University is quite strong. There are often hundreds of people in the library, guarding a fixed seat and working hard at the desk. Six gasoline lamps are hung up at night, shining brightly, and there is even a problem of overcrowding. The current students of Northeastern University include students from all provinces of the country. The number of Northeastern students has gradually decreased. Most of the students come from the occupied areas. When Northeastern students recall the past, they are all heartbroken. The sadness and solemnity are beyond words. They are still worthy of being Yan and Zhao scholars. Regardless of Northeast and Southeast, they are all people in distress. In the exchange of emotions, except for the slight difference in language, it is impossible to distinguish between Northeast and Southeast, or any regional bias. In this situation, they have cultivated a spirit of perseverance and tenacity. They are truly able to give personal accounts and have the courage to take responsibility without hesitation for all patriotic work such as propaganda, fundraising, or donation. In this year's spring Labor Army donation movement, the enthusiasm of the Santai people to donate broke all past donation records. The strength of Northeastern University is really great.

### Southwest Associated University Builds Spacious School Buildings, with Excellent School Spirit and Students Diligent in Self-Study

Southwest Associated University in Kunming, in terms of life, due to limited funds and location, all kinds of equipment are simple. Near Sanfen Temple in the north of the city, after more than a year of painstaking management, more than 40 student dormitories in the style of model prisons have finally been completed, as well as more than 30 classrooms and laboratories with relatively bright windows and clean desks, and there are also relatively spacious libraries and cafeterias. This is the so-called new campus of the Associated University. Recently, the Associated University, from professors and students to workers, has found that the most difficult and unsolvable problem is eating. In the past few months, the price of rice per shi (Dian people call dou as shi) has risen from 20 yuan to more than 60 yuan, and the food cost has risen from 6 yuan to 18 yuan per month, and there is a trend of increasing day by day. The suffering in this is really hard to say. The atmosphere of studying at the Associated University has always been very strong. Now there is only one library that can accommodate five or six hundred people in the new campus, which is full day and night. In addition, there is a magazine reading room and a reading room for specialized journals in the College of Science, which are also often full. It is a pity that these reading rooms are closed at night. After sunset, the students inevitably regard the eight teahouses on Longxiang Street outside the Great West Gate as self-study rooms. In order to occupy a bright place, they do not hesitate to spend a mao of national currency for each bowl of bitter tea.

### Aurora University Establishes Banking and Accounting Department

It is heard that the number of students who have registered for the lecture is very large, which shows that the Chinese and foreign university students of the school are very interested in this special subject.

### Yinqian Cup Ping Pong Performance, Wang Qing Representative Produced

Zhang Yongru and other ten female generals were selected. Shanghai women's table tennis has always been ignored by all walks of life, resulting in talents and levels being difficult to compete with men, which is a great pity. In view of this, the Shanghai Women's Youth Association hosted the All-Shanghai Women's Table Tennis Training Class last spring to promote it. Hundreds of people participated. In order to expand it, the association specially organized the "Women's Youth Table Tennis Team" and hired Mr. Chen Linsheng as the instructor. The Women's Youth has worked hard under his leadership for a year, and talents have emerged. They once defeated the men's team in a friendly match. The whole team is strong and the talents are average, which is rare in the history of women's table tennis. The enthusiastic promotion of the association has also attracted attention from all walks of life in Shanghai. Peicheng Girls' School responded first, followed by the Municipal Council Girls' School, Huadong Girls' School, Soochow University, and Baolian Industry Women's Team. Now, in order to promote women's table tennis, the Women's Youth Team has specially participated in the Yinqian Cup League. The league authorities have exceptionally allowed it as a performance item. The list of all the team members was produced yesterday, including Zhang Yongru (captain), Wang Guangmei (secretary), Hu Jiahe, Yang Chengdi, Fang Xiuwen, Zhu Shangxin Zhang Dexin, Xu Ruilan, Wang Mingxia, and Tao Lanying as official representatives, and He Jinxia, Zhang Yixuan, Fang Yangchu, and Zhu Min as new forces.

Calculation, Counting Rods, and the Abacus

The numerals used in Chinese calculations are generally of three kinds: (1) namely one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. These are the basic forms of numerals. (2) Namely 壹, 貳, 叁, 肆, 伍, 陸, 柒, 捌, 玖, 拾. These are commonly known as the "capitalized" numerals, mostly borrowed characters. (3) The "code numerals" used in the commercial and industrial sectors (see below), now also called "commercial numerals."

The first kind is borrowed for use as capitalized numerals (except for 壹, 貳, 叁, which were originally numerals) precisely because their strokes are more complex and not easily altered. Therefore, official documents (even now) and the writing of amounts on checks all use them. However, for ordinary bookkeeping, the basic form of numerals or the code numerals are still used for their ease of writing.

The origin of code numerals is ancient, but its source is unknown. In the past, people only knew that they existed but did not seek to understand why; moreover, they thought of them as a trivial commercial skill, not worth researching or investigating. Even those who knew their function were unwilling to put it in writing, which has led to modern people forgetting their ancestors. The desire to know what they were and why they existed has become unattainable. Several years ago, I was asked by a friend to write about this, but I was too lazy to put pen to paper. Now, seeing an article in this newspaper about the origin of Arabic numerals that touches on code numerals, I feel compelled to express my views and serve as a pioneer in researching code numerals.

"Code numerals" should be written as "counting rod numerals" (the "dock" in "dock numerals" is also written with the "rod" radical, not with the "code" radical, the "code" in "Morse code"). The origin of counting rod numerals is the counting rods used in the game of pitch-pot. The counting rods are the arrows of the game; the marker is the rod placed for the winner to keep score. The Book of Rites states in its section on pitch-pot: "After the regular cup has been drunk, please place a marker for the winner. One marker follows two markers, and after three markers are placed, please add more."

Kong Yingda said: "Placing markers means taking counters as markers to represent the winning score. Each win results in the placement of one marker. The ritual is based on the rule of three; after three markers are placed, please add more markers, meaning that the victory is complete." It also says:

"Counters are one foot and two inches long."

This refers to their length. But "counter" and "marker" are really the "substance" and the "function." Therefore, it is said:

"Each marker is worth its counter."

Pitch-pot

The marker is pictorial, embodying martial spirit in the game of pitch-pot, and is used to count the score of the winner.

The characters 筭 and 算 were originally different when they were created. The Shuowen Jiezi (Explanation of Script and Analysis of Characters) under the bamboo radical defines 筭 as:

"筭, six inches long, used for counting numbers; from bamboo and 弄 (nòng, to play with), one must constantly play with them to avoid mistakes."

The Shuowen Jiezi was written by someone during the Eastern Han Dynasty. At that time, the counters were six inches long, which is still about four inches according to today's measurement. Later, it was reduced to slightly over one inch. However, the explanation says that calculation requires constant practice to avoid errors, so 筭 contains 弄, deeply capturing the essence of learning calculation. Even those who study calculation today must practice constantly to succeed, showing that Chinese character creation can embody the meaning of how to succeed in learning calculation. It also says:

"算 (suàn), number; from bamboo and 具 (jù, tool), pronounced like 筭."

Duan Yucai commented: "筭 is the tool for calculation, and 算 is the function of 筭. The two characters have the same sound but different meanings." He also said: "算 refers to 筭 being used, different from using 算 to denote numbers, it means calculating." One is a noun, and the other is a verb. Among the characters related to divination, the one that best shows the form of counting rods is

“卦”

The shape of this character clearly shows the vertical and horizontal arrangement of counters, resembling the prototype of a calculating array.

Regarding the use of counters, the Shuowen Jiezi says:

"籌 (chóu), arrow for pitch-pot. From bamboo and 壽 (shòu, longevity, sound), Xu Kai said, the arrow for pitch-pot, its shape is like chopsticks, people use it to calculate numbers."

籌 originally referred to the arrows used in pitch-pot. The number of arrows successfully thrown determined the placing of markers to calculate wins and losses, and the use of 籌 was no different from that of markers. Thus, "籌" (counting rod) and "馬" (marker) became linked, forming the term "籌馬" (counting rod marker), a general term for calculating numbers in later generations. Although the system of counting rod calculation has been abolished, the use of counting rods to count numbers still prevails today. For example, warehouses still use bamboo sticks to count goods in and out. Therefore, Lao Yuchu said in his discussion on counting rod calculation: "算 is the proper name; 籌 is the common name; 數 is the pronunciation for using them to calculate. Their material is bamboo, their shape is like chopsticks, and their color is either red or black (positive counters are red, negative counters are black). Their length varies, being long in the past and short now. In ancient times, people sat on the ground to use them, laying out the calculation array on the ground, so they should be long; later generations used them on desks, so they should be short. Understanding this clarifies the reason why Zhang Liang borrowed chopsticks to represent strategies. In the early Han Dynasty, people still retained the habit of sitting on the ground (such as Emperor Wen of Han not noticing the length of the mat, showing the use of mats at that time). However, since 算 and 籌 were similar in shape, 'borrowing chopsticks' could 'replace counting rods,' but later people used the phrase without understanding why chopsticks could replace counters."

Now that the origin of counting rod calculation is clear, we can explore its form to understand the origin of counting rod numerals. In counting rod calculation, the arrangement of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4... has both vertical and horizontal formats (see figure). When arranging the counters, vertical and horizontal arrangements are alternated to avoid confusion. What is remarkable is that although counting rod calculation and written calculation differ across time, places, and cultures, the numbers are always listed from the left. The position of zeros in counting rod calculation (such as the zero between two numbers and the unit zero) is represented by a space, while in written notation, a zero is used. The placement of digits according to their place value is the same whether using counting rod or written calculation. Regardless of time or place, human consciousness is innate, so what humans create is largely similar with minor differences.

The loss of counting rod calculation, it is unknown when it began. I have examined the histories of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, but it is difficult to find traces of it. Generally, counting rod calculation was still prevalent during the Tang Dynasty, as can be seen in the biography of the monk Yi Xing, who created the Dayan Calendar in the Book of Tang:

"Yi Xing sought teachers and mentors to master the Dayan calendar. He went to the Qingliang Temple on Mount Tiantai and saw a courtyard with a dozen ancient pine trees and a stream flowing in front of the door. Yi Xing stood between the gate screen and heard monks in the courtyard arranging counters and saying to their disciples: 'Today, a disciple will come from afar seeking my calculation method. He has already arrived at the door. Is there no one to lead him in?' Then he removed a counter and said again: 'The water in front of the door will flow westward, and the disciple will also arrive.' Yi Xing accepted his words and rushed in, bowing and begging for the method, and received all his skills, and the water in front of the door indeed flowed westward."

After this, although the laws and calendars changed, the only mention of counting rod calculation in writings is the "Counting Rod Calculation" in the Ming History Art and Literature Catalogue by Luo Yagu. During the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, Mei Wending wrote "Study on Ancient Calculating Instruments," indicating that counting rod calculation was already lost.

When written calculation entered China, it is also impossible to ascertain, but it must have been during the Yuan Dynasty. In the fourth year of the Yuan Dynasty, the Muslim astronomer Jamal al-Din presented a ten-thousand-year calendar using his native calendar, with 365 days as a year, without intercalary months but with intercalary days. In the early Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, an official position was specially established for the Muslim calendar to manage its affairs, but it was later abolished. Afterwards, the calendar lost its order, and the timing of solar and lunar eclipses often did not match. Even on the night of the new moon, a crescent moon could be seen. Matteo Ricci came to China, bringing Western astronomy with him, and studied with Xu Guangqi and others in Shanghai. Xu then presented the theories of Western astronomy and, together with Diego de Pantoja, Sabatino de Ursis and others (all Western Catholic priests), revised the calendar. Later, other Catholic priests came to China, including Johann Adam Schall von Bell, Niccolò Longobardo, Luo Yagu, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, etc., all of whom have significant histories in Chinese astronomy. During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, Johann Adam Schall von Bell was even imprisoned for lecturing on the calendar, but his calculations were eventually proven accurate, and Ferdinand Verbiest (also a Western priest) rose up to exonerate him. Verbiest also manufactured cannons for Emperor Kangxi to quell the Three Feudatories. (It is noted that Xu Guangqi also advocated building cannons together with the priests to resist the Qing army, but this was rejected by the Ministry of War. Incompetent officials harmed the country, only knowing their own interests and not the public good.) Since the entry of written calculation into China, Chinese arithmetic has undergone a major change, and the decline of counting rod calculation is one of the major reasons.

Because counting rod calculation was used, the results of the calculations were recorded, depicting their shape, and becoming the popular counting rod numerals of today. This can be clearly seen in the attached figures. Counting rod numerals are the symbols for counting with counting rods. However, only 〡, 〤, and 文, three of the markers, do not match the shapes of counting rod calculations. These still need to be verified.

〡 is the shape of two crossed rods. Tracing its origins, it is the ancient character for "five," so it is unrelated to 〡. 〤 is the writing of "five" in one stroke (see attached figure), so it does not come from counting rod calculation. If 〡 and 〤 were arranged according to counting rod calculation, they would be either four or five strokes, or four or five vertical lines. The number of vertical lines is too many, making it inconvenient for writing, so simplification was sought, resulting in 〡 and 〤. The transformation of "nine" into "文" is also derived from counting rod calculation, but its form has been changed. The upper vertical stroke in counting rod calculation represents five, so "nine" is written as 文, with five on top and four below, adding up to nine.

Since counting rod numerals are derived from counting rod calculation, it is most appropriate to call them "counting rod markers." Calling them "commercial markers" is inaccurate, as the use of these markers is not limited to the commercial sector.

The abacus is merely the application of the principles of counting rod calculation to create a calculating tool. The abacus is the same to the counting rod except that the five-unit beads are placed on the horizontal bar, slightly differing from the horizontal format of counting rod calculation (in fact, it is still consistent. When adding one to four on the abacus, one first adds five and then subtracts four, and the five is on the upper bar. If one does not subtract four after adding five, it is still the same as the counting rod). The rest are all similar to the horizontal arrangement of counting rods (see attached figure). As for when the abacus originated, I have searched the historical records but could not find it. (I have not read many histories, so perhaps it exists but I have not found it! I don't know if there is any record of this in Mei Wending's "Collection of Books," but I regret that I have not seen the book.) However, it seems that counting rod calculation has gradually been lost since the Yuan and Ming dynasties. There must have been something that rose to replace it at that time. Otherwise, a calculation tool, indispensable in daily life, would not have been lost. It is suspected that the abacus was already invented at that time. Moreover, the formulas for the abacus originally came from counting rod calculation. The origins of the formulas are ancient. Hong Zhai of the Song Dynasty recorded common sayings in the "Continued Writings of Hong Zhai," such as "three four twelve, three six eighteen..." He said that Huainanzi and Du Yu's annotation of Zuo Zhuan had the sentence "eight eight sixty-four" (I cannot remember the original text, only the general meaning), indicating that it was already popular between the Han and Jin dynasties. This provides further evidence that the multiplication table currently used is derived from ancient counting rod calculation.

The transformation from counting rod calculation to abacus is an advancement in Chinese calculation tools. Using rods to arrange counters is not as convenient as the free movement of circular beads on a cylindrical frame. Each rod fixes the number of beads, with one bead on the upper bar representing five and each bead on the lower bar representing one, which is essentially the same as counting rod calculation. However, during operations, except for the occasional simultaneous use of two beads on the upper bar, the beads on the upper and lower bars are usually sufficient, unlike counting rods, which are easily confused, and the positioning is not as fixed as on the abacus. The abacus is more flexible than counting rod calculation, so people prefer to use it, and counting rod calculation is no longer considered.

For addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the abacus is faster than written calculation. Lao Yuchu's "Study on Counting Rod Calculation" also states that square root extraction is faster with counting rod calculation than with written calculation, but I have not tried it. However, I believe that except for the newly invented calculators, the abacus is the most convenient calculation tool. Although there is the regret that errors are not easily detected, this is due to the lack of "constant practice." Those who practice constantly will rarely make mistakes. This can be seen in the several famous abacus masters in the money industry, who move the beads like flying, causing those who are fast at written calculation to sigh in admiration. Even modern calculators are sometimes not as fast. It is a pity that although the number of abacus learners has gradually become common in recent years, those with excellent operational skills are rarely seen.

The fact that Chinese counting rod numerals are derived from counting rod calculation should not be greatly mistaken. However, whether Arabic numerals are transformed from Chinese counting rod numerals or introduced from India, I dare not make a rash judgment before further research. I will leave the theory as is and await future verification. It is noted that the communication between Islam and China occurred during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang (Muhammad conquered Mecca and dominated Arabia in the fourth year of Zhenguan, which is the year of Gengyin). During the first year of Qianyuan in the reign of Emperor Suzong, Princess Ningguo was married to the Uyghur Khan. During the first year of Yongtai in the reign of Emperor Daizong, the Uyghurs and Tibetans invaded, and Guo Ziyi took off his helmet to meet the Uyghurs and made a pact before returning. The communication between China and Islamic countries was most frequent during these 150 years. If counting rod numerals were introduced from China to the Uyghurs during this period, it would not be easy to draw a conclusion without a thorough study of Arabian history. As for being introduced from India, it would be necessary to find additional clues from the historical facts of both India and Arabia. However, I have a doubt, which is that the formal structure of Roman numerals is surprisingly similar to Chinese counting rod numerals. Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ are inherently the same as the vertical arrangement in counting rod calculation. Although the form is different from five to nine, the principle is the same. China and Rome are two of the four ancient civilizations in the East, and the numbers are similar. What is the significance of this? There is still room for research, but unfortunately, I am unlearned and unable to resolve my doubts.

"Economic Miscellany" is not often published, not because there is a lack of manuscripts, but because there is a lack of position; it is not written for a lack of position, but also because those with a position should provide readers with content, so "Economic Miscellany" is not published in this newspaper unless it is necessary. In the future, it will be published in "Liutang's Jottings" to seek recognition in the world, but I do not know when that will be. — The Editor

### Further Discussion on Arabic Numerals

— Shen Yan

I was very interested in an article about "Arabic Numerals" written by Mr. Xu Wenwen in the Commercial News on August 28th. Mr. Xu's conclusion is that Arabic numerals are definitely derived from Chinese commercial numerals. However, as far as I know, what are now called "Arabic numerals" were not actually invented by the Arabs, but were learned from India. Because ancient Indian astronomy was very developed, mathematics developed as a result of need. We can see the Arab's learning of mathematics from India in H.G. Wells' "The Outline of History." Wells said: "...Besides this, the Arabs received further stimulation from a third source, namely India, and mathematics especially benefited from this..." Thus, the Arabs learning from India can be proven.

However, there are two theories as to how India invented these numerals; but whether they are true or not, the author will leave it to the readers to discuss.

The first theory is that these Indian numerals evolved from tally marks. The simplest is to represent "one" with one stroke and "two" with two strokes. This is also the case with our Chinese tally marks (not commercial numerals). The author believes that this theory is the most accurate and reliable: (see figure below)

The second theory is that Indian numerals evolved from angles. Because ancient peoples had a concept of angles very early on. The Babylonians, four to five thousand years ago, had already invented angles of sixty degrees. Moreover, angles are very useful for astronomy, and India, as an advanced country in astronomy, certainly had a concept of angles very early on. However, the author believes that this theory is not as reliable as the first, because the invention of a straight line must have come earlier than that of an angle, and it is more mysterious and difficult than tally marks. (see figure above)

Finally, as for Chinese commercial numerals, the author believes that they were also introduced to China from India by Xuanzang after he brought back the scriptures from India during the Tang Dynasty?

### Finance - Changes in British-American Exchange Rates over the Past Year

Before this European war, British-American exchange rates were consistently around the par value of four dollars and eighty-six cents. Until August 25th of last year, due to the impending European war, capital flight, and the abandonment of maintaining the exchange rate, the British pound fell to four dollars and ten cents on August 28th. In September, the United Kingdom implemented exchange controls, and the London market only had an official fixed exchange rate of four dollars and two and a half cents. As for the New York pound, it could still be freely traded. On March 5th of this year, the British government announced the strengthening of exchange control, and the exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar fell to three dollars and seventy cents. When the German army attacked Norway on April 9th, it fell to three dollars and forty cents. As the German army invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, it fell further, once reaching three dollars and fifteen cents. On the 6th, the British government announced that securities owned by non-British residents could no longer be sold in markets within the sterling area. The free price of the pound in New York immediately rebounded, and has recently been around four dollars. Last Saturday, it was four dollars and three and three-quarters cents. However, according to the exchange rates of Shanghai's British and American currencies on Saturday, one pound was only worth three dollars and fifty-three cents. That is, according to the closing price of the British exchange rate on Saturday, three pence point six nine three seven five, selling one pound of British gold, receiving sixty-six yuan, forty-nine cents in national currency. At the same time, the closing price of the US exchange rate was five yuan point three one two five. Buying US dollars with the price of one pound of British gold only amounted to three dollars and fifty-three cents in US dollars. Compared with the New York British-American exchange rate, the difference per pound reaches more than fifty cents in US dollars.

### Metals - Tin Plate Shows Signs of Hoarding

-Flat Galvanized Iron Weak-

Recently, the route for North China galvanized iron has slightly improved, but not much. Asking prices such as six yuan and a half per six-foot sheet and seven yuan and fifty cents per seven-foot sheet are quoted.

Transactions of tinplate in the city are also small. However, it is heard that in the past two days, the industry has been absorbing and hoarding. This is probably due to concerns about the Dutch East Indies. The amount of stock in the market is not abundant. After this search, the standard price will inevitably rise. Therefore, yesterday's price for 99.5% pure tin had to be sold at 1,500 yuan.

### Distinguishing Between Real and Fake Banknotes of Various Banks

— Shen Yun

Shanghai circulating banknotes, besides the legal tender of the Central, China, Communications, and China Farmers Banks, also include those from the China Workers' and Peasants', China South, and Siming Banks (the banknotes of these three banks are handled by the Central Bank as an agent), the China General Chamber of Commerce, and Agricultural and Commercial Banks (the banknotes of these two banks are handled by the Bank of China as an agent), Zhejiang Industrial, China Industrial, and China Reclamation Banks (the banknotes of these three banks are handled by Communications Bank as an agent), totaling eight banks. Additionally, there is the Zhejiang Local Bank, but most of its banknotes (with the Hangzhou place name) have been withdrawn, and are rarely seen in the market.

Banknote denominations are divided into five types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan. Each denomination has different styles and colors due to different issuing years and versions. There are also banknotes with place names from other provinces (commonly known as "foreign vouchers"), some of which are usable and some are not (legal tender issued in recent years has no place names and is universally usable throughout the country). Furthermore, some receiving bank vouchers have been converted into legal tender, such as the China Workers' and Peasants' Bank converting Central Bank one-yuan notes, the China Industrial Bank converting Communications Bank one-yuan notes, and the Hubei Provincial Bank converting China Farmers Bank five-yuan and ten-yuan notes. The above are just a rough outline, and the variety is already numerous, dazzling to the eye.

However, distinguishing banknotes is based on the memory and skilled instinct that we should possess. If there is a good method to facilitate checking, wouldn't it save our time and brainpower, and avoid unexpected losses? As for the editor of this newspaper, he mentioned in a previous note that many banknotes had hidden marks before watermarks were introduced, but he was unwilling to reveal them, fearing that counterfeiters would imitate them, and claimed that counterfeiters deliberately left flaws on banknotes to reduce their sentences when caught in the future. However, in my humble opinion, the hidden marks on banknotes before watermarks were introduced were originally for the purpose of identification. The fact that they were not publicly announced is true, but the shape of the hidden marks was not disclosed to the silver and money industry either. As for not publishing the hidden marks for fear that counterfeiters would imitate them, this is not the case. Counterfeiters generally take photos of genuine banknotes as blueprints and then make copperplate prints. Therefore, the patterns on counterfeit banknotes are generally rough and blurry. The hidden marks on genuine banknotes are extremely small, often beyond the reach of eyesight. The patterns on counterfeit banknotes are blurry, so these fine hidden marks cannot be printed. The so-called deliberate exposure of flaws to make it easier to identify is merely due to the limitations of printing technology. Counterfeiters want to make counterfeit banknotes as realistic as possible so that recipients do not notice them. Try folding and comparing genuine and counterfeit banknotes, and you will see that the surrounding patterns, lines, and numerical shapes match. From this, it can be seen that this is a technical issue, not a matter of avoiding punishment. Does the editor agree?

Editor's Note: Regarding the saying that counterfeit banknotes are not made to be realistic in order to reduce punishment, I vaguely remember that when counterfeit banknotes of a certain bank in the late Qing Dynasty were discovered and the case was solved, the counterfeiters presented a counter-argument, claiming that the double dragons on the banknote did not have pupils. However, due to the length of time, the details of the case cannot be clearly remembered. The editor has also heard about reprinting from genuine banknotes.

Now, I will list a table of the types of banknotes issued by the Central Bank, the characteristics of distinguishing counterfeit notes, and the various types of altered notes, for the reference of all sectors.

(1) Central Bank Banknotes

Denomination / Year of Printing / Printing Company / Shape and Color / Counterfeit Notes? / Identification and Characteristics / Altered Notes? / Remarks

100 yuan / 1928 / American Bank Note Company / Black-gray pattern on the front, "One Hundred Yuan" written horizontally under the name of the Central Bank, purple-gray on the back, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the middle / None yet / None yet / All banknotes listed in the table are circulating in the market and are commonly seen by all sectors. A separate table will be provided to explain withdrawn circulating vouchers and universally usable foreign vouchers.

50 yuan / Same as above / Same as above / Orange pattern on the front, blue-gray on the back, style is the same as the 100 yuan note / None yet / None yet

10 yuan / Same as above / Same as above / Blue-black pattern on the front, green on the back, style is the same as the 100 yuan note / Counterfeit notes have rough patterns and are easy to identify, so they are rarely found in the market / Yes / There are Hankou notes altered to Shanghai notes, printed in 1926, which have been discontinued. Counterfeiters alter the place names and mix them in the market. However, the front of these notes is red with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the middle, and the back is blue, which is easiest to identify, because Shanghai notes are not red. / The front and back mentioned in the above table refer to the Chinese text as the front and the English text as the back.

10 yuan / 1936 / Giesecke & Devrient / Blue-black pattern on the front, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen on the left and a blank circle on the right, viewed against the light reveals a watermark of Sun Yat-sen's portrait, gray-green on the back, with the Marble Boat and ancient trees / Yes / Counterfeit notes have slightly thicker paper, blurry surrounding patterns, black shadows on both sides of Sun Yat-sen's portrait, clear squares on genuine notes, unconnected squares on counterfeit notes, fine patterns on the face of the genuine portrait, clear eyebrows and eyes, rough and blurry patterns on counterfeit notes, but there is one distinguishing feature, that is, the watermark of Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the right side of the note is not visible when viewed straight on, but only when viewed against the light, while it is visible when viewed straight on for counterfeit notes. / The "shape and color" column above could have been omitted, but often there are stopped redemption vouchers from other banks that are converted into universal vouchers, small denomination vouchers that are converted into large denomination vouchers. By listing this column, it is easier to compare and identify questionable banknotes.

10 yuan / 1936 / Thomas De La Rue & Company, Limited / Blue-black pattern on the front, Sun Yat-sen portrait on the left, slightly smaller than the Giesecke & Devrient version, with a watermark beside it, the right side of the back is a view of an ancient palace / Yes / Counterfeit notes have rough paper, surrounding patterns are slightly lighter and very blurry than genuine notes, the face of Sun Yat-sen is also not clear, the cloud shadows on the palace on the back have the roughest patterns, which is the easiest place to identify, and there is another feature, that is, there is no Sun Yat-sen watermark in the blank space on the right side, the numbers on both sides are also dimmer and unclear than the genuine ones.

5 yuan / 1930 / American Bank Note Company / Green on the front, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the middle, green on the back, with a view of Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum in the middle / Yes / Many of these counterfeit notes have been found in the market, there are several types, those with rough printing patterns are easy to identify, those with fine printing are more difficult to distinguish, but the face of Sun Yat-sen is ultimately more blurry than the genuine ones, and there is another distinguishing feature, that is, the five-yuan note only has counterfeit notes with the hidden marks "Ju" "Ji" "Xin". The hidden mark characters are black on the front right corner, and red under the seal on the back right corner, the characters are large and noticeable. / None yet / Before this version was issued, there was another five-yuan note from 1928, the pattern on the front was dark coffee color, the back was red, and there was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the right corner. This voucher has been completely withdrawn, but it has not been stopped from redemption, and may still be found in the market, and is still universally usable. However, this voucher also has counterfeit notes, which are easy to identify.

5 yuan / 1936 / Giesecke & Devrient / Green pattern on the front, green on the back, the Sun Yat-sen portrait watermark and the scenery on the back are the same as the Giesecke & Devrient ten-yuan version, but the surrounding patterns are slightly different / Yes / The points for distinguishing these five-yuan counterfeit notes are the same as those for the Giesecke & Devrient ten-yuan counterfeit notes / None yet / The three hidden marks "Ju," "Ji," and "Xin" mentioned in the above table for five-yuan counterfeit notes are the hidden mark exchange vouchers that various money houses and commercial banks received from the Central Bank. The counterfeiters used these three types of hidden mark vouchers as samples, so the counterfeit notes also have these three hidden marks.

5 yuan / 1936 / Thomas De La Rue & Company, Limited / Green pattern on the front, light green on the back, the pattern is the same as the Thomas De La Rue ten-yuan version, the surrounding patterns are slightly different, and there is also a watermark in the right corner / Yes / The printing of the patterns on the front of these counterfeit notes is clearer than other counterfeit notes, and the patterns on Sun Yat-sen's portrait are also clear, making it difficult to distinguish at a glance. The watermark on the right side is not visible when viewed straight on like the ten-yuan counterfeit notes, but must be viewed against the light to be seen, but the watermark is not as clear as the genuine notes, the color on the back is dim, and the palace patterns are blurry, making it still easy to identify. / There are five-yuan notes altered to ten-yuan notes. The counterfeiters take advantage of the fact that the patterns are almost the same as the ten-yuan notes, print the number ten on the paper, glue it on, and iron it flat. Just remember that the ten-yuan notes issued by this bank have blue patterns on the front, and the five-yuan notes have green patterns.

1 yuan / 1928 / American Bank Note Company / Green pattern on the front, brown on the back, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the right corner / Yes / This one-yuan note is widely circulated in the market, the counterfeit notes are also rough, the paper is oily, and the eyebrows and eyes of Sun Yat-sen's portrait are unclear, which is the easiest point to identify, and the colors of the patterns on the front and back are also lighter than the genuine ones / None yet

1 yuan / 1936 / China Police Bureau / Red pattern on the front, with a black Marble Boat scene on the right, dark brown on the back / Yes / The authenticity of this note can be noted on the right side of the front, the Marble Boat scene, the patterns on the genuine notes are fine and bright, the counterfeit notes are pale and blurry / None yet / There is also another type of this note, the front and back colors are the same, only the Marble Boat on the right side of the front is red instead of black, and is universally usable like the black one, and there are no counterfeit notes

1 yuan / 1936 / Giesecke & Devrient / Orange pattern on the front, brown on the back, the pattern style is the same as the Giesecke & Devrient ten-yuan and five-yuan versions, and there is also a watermark / Yes / Counterfeit notes have rough paper, blurry patterns, and no watermark, making them very easy to identify, so they are rarely found in the market

1 yuan / 1936 / Thomas De La Rue & Company, Limited / Ocher pattern on the front, orange-yellow on the back, the pattern style and watermark are the same as the Thomas De La Rue ten-yuan and five-yuan versions / Yes / Identification is the same as above / None yet

1 yuan / 1934 / American Bank Note Company / The patterns on the front and back are both red, which are Central Bank notes altered by the China Workers' and Peasants' Bank. The six characters of the China Workers' and Peasants' Bank are covered with a red seal, with the Central Bank printed below, with a scene of a farmer plowing the field with a cow in the middle, and the hidden mark "央" on both sides / None / This is an alterated voucher that can be universally used, there are three types, one is a no-place-name voucher, one is a Beijing-place-name voucher, and one is a Tianjin-place-name voucher, all of which are universally usable

### Two Lessons in Life (1)

Dear Readers: In the past month, we have introduced to you the sacrifice, courage, and forgiveness of Jesus Christ. Although we could continue to talk about Jesus' other virtues, in order to give you some insight in terms of thought, let us study life. One says, "My warehouse is full and I have no place to store my goods," and the other says, "Jehovah has treated me with great kindness." In other words, the happiness of one person is based on material wealth. From the lives of these two people, we can learn three lessons about life: (1) From looking at the lives of these two people, we can know what is real and what is illusory. Ordinary people always think that what can be seen with the eyes and touched with the hands is real, otherwise it is regarded as illusory. Therefore, they compete for wealth in material things, and want more when they have more, and want more even when they have enough. They are greedy and insatiable, and completely focus their energy on material things, even putting God out of their minds and neglecting their own souls. What a dangerous and heartbreaking thing this is!

Jesus said, "A person's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions." (Luke 12:15) In other words, a person with a rich family may not have a rich life. Many people are burdened by their wealth and cannot live in peace. There are also many people who work hard all their lives, save every penny, and when they are old and weak, they cannot get health even if they have money. If they are unfortunate enough to encounter natural or man-made disasters, the rich can immediately become poor. If we can see through all this and distinguish between the real and the illusory, and cherish what is truly real, then we are truly wise. (To be continued on the 20th)

Women

### Wife's Sacrifice

— Yan Zhi

"...Sister is not a mediocre person, on the contrary, you are several times stronger than me. But now you are buried in the trivial matters of the family! I am not against you staying at home, but I think you can avoid becoming a vulgar person. That does not mean that you must do something earth-shattering. Is it not an urgent task to nurture the future masters and strengthen their education? Don't look down on small things, they are our reserve army!..."

Reading the letter from her younger sister from distant northern Shaanxi, the wife smiled and said nothing. But I once again felt ashamed and wanted to hide myself.

My wife graduated from the normal school of a famous girls' middle school in Shanghai. At school, because of her excellent character and learning, teachers and friends praised her as one of the most promising. In the days when I first met her, she was already working in a company. At that time, our ideals were very beautiful. We planned to go out early and return late together after marriage, each fulfilling our respective responsibilities to the country and society. Unexpectedly, not long before our wedding, the company she was working for closed down and she lost her job. Then we got married and had children...

My wife began to be buried in the trivial matters of the family, especially after we left my old family. The beautiful ideal finally turned into a bubble! The past seems like a dream. My wife had to abandon books and her ideals, and wander around the vegetable market, kitchen, and bedroom. She became an excellent housekeeper. This sacrifice is quite huge, and I often feel ashamed and want to hide myself when I think about it!

Then her younger sister went to northern Shaanxi alone. Her second sister also became a teacher. I understand how these two things affected and impacted my wife. But my wife's character is quite stubborn. She doesn't like to recall the past. On the contrary, she seizes the present and enthusiastically educates the children. Her attention is completely focused on the three children, as if she entrusts her hopes to them. She wants to pass on everything she knows to them. In this way, our eldest child was able to enter a strict primary school. The second child at home hums the three kindergarten textbooks that her older brother has read to pieces, and our ten-month-old Ah San claps his little hands and laughs when he sees strangers!

In addition, one point is worth mentioning: my wife's love for the children is latent. She educates the children like a park gardener taking care of the flowers and trees he planted, and at the same time he understands that those flowers and trees belong to the public.

Reading the letter from her younger sister from distant northern Shaanxi, the wife smiled and said nothing. But I once again felt ashamed and wanted to hide myself.

I don't know how many other people have made sacrifices like my wife!

War

### War and Climate

— Shi Tao

Human material civilization is so developed, and human wars seem to be becoming more and more frequent. Recently, general astronomers have been enthusiastically studying the relationship between war and climate. They believe that the sunspots have a great relationship with war. The more sunspots there are, the more excited humans become due to the stimulation of ultraviolet radiation, leading to the outbreak of war. However, their arguments have not yet matured. We will put aside for the moment how much influence the number of sunspots has on the occurrence of war. At least climate has a great relationship with combat: it is not uncommon for humans to use the variations of severe cold, heavy rain, dense fog, etc. to make special strategies. Kongming borrowing arrows in Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a perfect example.

In peacetime, meteorological business is international. In order to make accurate weather forecasts, it is necessary to exchange meteorological information with neighboring countries. However, in today's wartime, when iron crows are flying everywhere, belligerent countries are keeping meteorological information secret, because if the other party knows the climate here, the crisis of being bombed by enemy planes will be even greater. According to American newspapers and periodicals, the European belligerent countries have recently implemented meteorological controls and are also trying their best to collect meteorological information from the enemy.

The confidentiality of meteorological information to prevent enemy aircraft from being active is certainly a major reason. After the outbreak of the European War, the British and French did not implement meteorological control for a long period of time, which resulted in London being bombed by German aircraft countless times. The United Kingdom has learned from the past lessons and will naturally not repeat the same mistakes.

In this great war, poison gas does not seem to have been used yet. Of course, the release of poison gas and the spread of bacteria are prohibited by international law in wartime, but even if it is not prohibited, poison gas is difficult to use in war. In order for gas warfare to be effective, it must meet three conditions: (1) There must be a large amount of gas material, (2) The wind force is weak, the wind is blowing towards the enemy, and there must be a temperature inversion layer, The replenishment of gas materials is now very difficult, and the accumulation of gas also takes a considerable amount of time, so it is impossible to meet the needs of emergencies, As for the second condition, it is even more noteworthy, Once the poison gas is released, it will dissipate after a considerable period of time, and its density will gradually decrease until it loses its effectiveness, Poison gas is most suitable in a wind speed of about one and a half meters, In order for the released poison gas to stay on the ground for a long time, there must be a temperature inversion layer of at least two meters high on the ground. However, this so-called temperature inversion only occurs on clear mornings, It is naturally a necessary condition for the wind to blow towards the enemy, but when the wind speed is one and a half meters per second, the general wind direction is uncertain, It will be a southerly wind for a while, and then it will suddenly become a northerly wind, Moreover, the wind direction is also prone to sudden changes due to the influence of terrain, Therefore, the time to spread poison gas and is subject to many restrictions.

### Essay: Longing for Hometown

— Pin Pin

I have always longed for my hometown. My father said: Our hometown is behind the sea and in front of the mountain. What a beautiful place this is, even now I think about it. The sea must be roaring, and the mountains must be flashing with five colors in the sunset; a world of music and painting, which cannot be described in words.

My hometown is also a fragrant world, because it is located in the south, with the fragrance of fruit trees and exotic flowers, and the fragrance of seafood and delicacies. In the past, whether my father returned to his hometown or people from the hometown came to Shanghai, they always brought many fragrant things to eat, such as hexagonal star fruit, lumpy pineapples, flat dried yuyus fish, and round sweet potato heads... I devoured them like a hungry ghost. When I was a child, everyone called me a "glutton," but who wouldn't be a glutton in front of these fragrant things? When I grew up, I wasn't a glutton anymore, but there were also few things to put in my mouth - my father was often unemployed and couldn't afford to buy them.

And now there is nothing left. Not only are there no star fruit and pineapples, but there is not even the sea and the mountains. The sea and the mountains are covered with dim shadows. Music turns into wails, and the picture turns into fresh blood, and fragrance turns into the stench of corpses; this is already a pile of broken things.

Oh, hometown, how much I long for you!

From birth to today, I have never visited my hometown, because there was no opportune opportunity. I have been buried in the city's cave for too long, and I only hate the city. I dream of my hometown, I think of my hometown, what about today?

Therefore, I long for my hometown all the more.

My hometown is broken, but to whom? I know it clearly. I don't complain, I believe that my hometown is only temporarily broken, and in a day that is coming soon, it will surely destroy the destroyer, and a new world will appear in the brokenness. Temporary brokenness is necessary, because it prepares for new life. - Then, roar, sea and mountain! So, raise up iron-like fists! Before many other people's hometowns get the dawn of liberation, mine is also in the light.

I am going to go to my hometown, bringing a pot of wine to drink to the Dragon.

### Am I Old?

— Pu Ming

There are many successful business people who, although they are old, still have young hearts, feel fresh about everything, and keep overcoming all difficulties, and see the path of life as long and broad.

"Old!" This is the death knell of life. A person's ambition will never be old, and the power of struggle has no end.

Nietzsche said: "You should not love the country of your ancestors, but you should love the country of your descendants." We should not love the past time, but should love the days to come. No matter how great a career you have done, it is not worth crossing, you should still work hard, and there is no time to stop by shouting old.

Hawthorne Case

### The Dancer's Fate

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 7 "Take Him Away"

"After finishing dinner, you went to the movie theater. After the movie was over, what happened?"

"I sent her back."

"Did you go in with her?"

"No, I didn't go in. My car stopped at the door and let her get out alone. Because it was raining heavily, I wouldn't get out of the car myself."

"The movie ended at half past eleven. I sent her home, at most around quarter to twelve."

"Did you see anyone at the door?"

"No - Mr. Hawthorne, are you asking about Zhao Boxiong?"

Hawthorne didn't answer, but continued to ask himself: "At that time, did you see any lights in the reception room downstairs?"

Lu Jiansheng had a thoughtful look, as if trying to recall something. Then, he shook his head and said, "I didn't notice, because I wouldn't get out of the car."

"Are you sure you didn't get out of the car? I think it's better for you to tell the truth."

"Of course it's the truth, I really wouldn't get out of the car."

"I went home -"

Hawthorne suddenly cut him off and said, "Went home? Is that the truth too?"

Lu Jiansheng's body froze, and an undisguisable look of astonishment floated on his face. He hurriedly corrected himself and said, "Ah! No, I went to the Yangtze Hotel."

Hawthorne sneered. "Mr. Lu, you're too forgetful, it's only been a few hours, and you can't remember."

The big belly frowned tightly, lowered his gaze, and his right thumb and index finger were constantly spinning the unlit cigar. This embarrassing state was really ridiculous and pitiful.

He struggled to say, "Mr. Hawthorne, don't take it seriously, it was a slip of the tongue. I went to the Yangtze Hotel to play mahjong, and didn't go home until dawn. I only found out about Wang Lilan's murder when I got home." (109)

Entertainment world

### Amidst a Chorus of Birthday Wishes, Let's Talk About Wang Yaoqing's Students

— Sick Dove

The veteran actor Wang Yaoqing, since accompanying his female disciple Wang Yurong southward last year, has left a very good impression on the people of Shanghai. This year, his sixtieth birthday falls on the upper ten days of the eighth lunar month, so the theatrical circles in the old capital are putting on performances to offer congratulations, an unprecedented grand occasion. Amidst a chorus of birthday wishes, his students are kept extremely busy making arrangements. Newspapers in both Beijing and Shanghai are competing to record these events, which is also a wonderful story in the theatrical world.

Yaoqing is the elder brother of Fengqing and was the first student to emerge under Chen Delin. He enjoyed a great reputation at the end of the Guangxu era. When Tan Xinpei performed, Yaoqing always played the supporting role of the female lead, perfectly matching him in every way. His name was highly respected at the time, and his reputation remains excellent to this day. He excels in all types of female roles – Qingyi (virtuous woman), Dan (young female), and Daomadan (female warrior). After his voice weakened, he devoted himself to dialogue plays, reciting lines with precision and clarity, sharp and experienced, unmatched by anyone. He is especially skilled in performing Qing court dramas. It is said that when he served in the inner court, he was exposed to the behavior of the consorts of princes and dukes, and when he reenacted them, he captured their essence perfectly. He is good at creating new tunes and has a deep understanding of the sounds of words. In terms of costumes, such as the barbarian boots of the Thirteenth Sister and the flag worn on the back by Princess Shuangyang, he created them all. He has made many contributions to the theatrical world throughout his life, and his achievements are no less than those of the veteran Tan Xinpei. On the occasion of his auspicious birthday, it is only right that we express our appreciation.

Since retiring, Yaoqing has made a living by teaching students, and no fewer than dozens have sought to study under him. The following is a list of those I remember; those who only enrolled in name but did not truly learn are not included.

Male Performers: Rong Diexian, Mei Lanfang, Wang Huifang, Shang Xiaoyun, Luo Xiaobao (Xiao, before changing to playing male roles, sang Qingyi), Cuihua, Jiang Miaoxiang, Furongcao, Wang Yunfang, Gou Huisheng, Cheng Yanqiu, Cheng Yuqing, Li Xiangyun, Ma Yanbing, Huang Yulin, Dai Yanfang, Li Zhizhi, Guo Xiaoqing, Guo Xianglin, Wu Lanfang, Wang Shengyi, Sun Shengfang, Nan Tiesheng, Zhang Xiaoshan (amateur), etc.

Female Performers: Xue Yanqin, Xin Yanqiu, Du Liyun, Hua Huilin, Zhang Eryun, Mao Jianpei (deceased), Zou Jianpei, Li Yinxiang, Jin Suqin, Li Yanchun, Wang Yurong, and the recently accepted Lu Ranxiang, Zhang Yunyan (i.e., Qiu Yunyan, who went north), etc.

Among Wang Yaoqing's students, the Four Great Dan are the most successful. However, in terms of actual skill, Cheng Yuqing can be said to be a miniature representation of him. Although Mei and Cheng received instruction from Yaoqing, they did not completely imitate him, instead adapting to their own personalities, drawing on the strengths of many others, and incorporating everything, which allowed them to achieve their current status. The fact that they achieved this through their own efforts is certainly commendable, but the contribution of Yaoqing in guiding them cannot be ignored. Huisheng and Tongshan have the best grasp of Wang's Beijing vernacular. In the amateur circles, Nan Tiesheng (now performing professionally) has learned the superficial aspects, while Zhang Xiaoshan has entered the inner sanctum, and his skill is no less than that of a professional. Among the female performers, Xue Yanqin and Xin Yanqiu have both received personal instruction and have gained something from it. Zhang Eryun has studied with Wang the longest, and her skills far surpass those of ordinary performers. She can be called the number one female Dan. Hua Huilin lacks talent, and Wang Yurong only excels in singing; neither is particularly gifted. As for those below them, there is even less to say.

### A Film Producer Talks About the "Almost" Tendency in the Film Industry

— Sea Star

I met a film mogul at a banquet and talked about the production direction of domestic films. The mogul spoke freely about his personal views, which could serve as valuable reference for today's filmmakers. He said: "In the past, the literary and art circles had a 'close enough' tendency. Today, the film industry seems to be following suit. All companies are flocking to historical dramas, and their nature is nothing more than two types. One is romance stories about young masters and young ladies, which account for nineteen out of ten films made in the Republic era. The other type depicts tragic historical events, which have good subject matter, but the layout and characters are mostly the same. Some people call it 'silver eight-legged essays,' which doesn't seem like an exaggeration. I believe that whether it's a historical or modern drama, it can be filmed. The form can be flexible, but the theme must be new. The so-called 'new' doesn't mean being unconventional or indulging in fantasy. To live up to its original purpose, a film doesn't necessarily have to depict loyal ministers sacrificing themselves for their country or chaste women dying for their virtue. There are plenty of other good subjects to explore." The "close enough" problem really needs to be examined by today's filmmakers, otherwise, they are bound to get narrower and narrower.

### The Smile of Empress Li Qinian

### Review of "Li Xiangjun"

— Jin Ge

Indeed, "Li Xiangjun" is a work worth seeing.

Adapted from the stage to the screen, with the original author serving as the adapter, the plot has not changed much. Therefore, many of the cautionary dialogues in the play are still preserved, and many scenes that could not be performed in the play due to spatial limitations can be fully realized through the unique technology of film.

Director Wu Cun is competent. He handles the lingering affections of the male and female protagonists with his unique style, delicate and vivid. He also uses bold and decisive techniques for several war scenes. It's just that the capturing of the climax is still slightly insufficient.

Mr. Zou Xiao said that the author's description of the characters' psychology in the play is extremely delicate. The director's thorough understanding and self-creation are also very successful in this regard. For example, when General Wang sends bribes, Chaozong's hesitation reveals his wavering will and foreshadows his future surrender. Also, the hedonistic Prince Fu secretly peeks at the script of "The Swallow Note" when he is welcomed into the capital, which shows that he is an incompetent person who does not care about politics. The handling of the scene where Xiangjun faints after hitting the window is inappropriate. Although it is not necessary to call a doctor, Zhen should at least bandage Xiangjun or apply some medicine, otherwise it seems too unreasonable. The arrangement of the camera angles shows great care and also increases its artistic achievement.

Gu Lanjun gives a very good performance. The scene where she throws the bottle and Hou vomits blood and dies tragically is performed very well. However, the expression in her eyes when speaking is sometimes too mechanical. I hope she can pay attention to this. Bai Yun's Hou Chaozong can be said to be largely dutiful, but he is a little too frivolous.

The profound meaning of the script, the excellent directing techniques, the deep acting skills of the actors, and everything else will not disappoint you. This film can be said to be the first ray of light from Golden Star.

### Examination of Kunqu Lyrics

— Master of the Flute Pavilion

Since the beginning, amateur performers and dramatists have all said that Kunqu scripts are more elegant and refined than Beijing opera. However, few people are inclined to study it. In times of war and chaos, people's hearts are strong and resolute, and culture is declining, making it difficult to understand the profound. The sound of insects heralds the arrival of autumn, and the rumble of thunder brings mountain rain. From this, we know that the way of sound is not unrelated to the fate of the world. I have often dabbled in various romances, such as "Singing Phoenix," "Jingchai," "White Rabbit," and "Loyalty," all of which emphasize loyalty and righteousness. "Pipa" and "Bowing to the Moon" are deeply devoted to filial piety. "Red Pear" and "Jade Hairpin" are refined and elegant. The Four Dreams of Yuming have beautiful words and strict rhythm, and slow and gentle melodies, which can cultivate the mind and should not be regarded as mere expressions of love. I have occasionally selected good lines to share with like-minded people, and I hope that gentlemen in the world will promote them.

(1) "Wandering in the Garden" (Soap Gauze Robe): "Flying in the morning and rolling in the evening, the clouds and mists decorate the emerald pavilion; threads of rain and slices of wind, misty painted boats; the embroidered screen and beautiful people look down upon the fleeting spring." Just imagine Du Liniang entering the garden, seeing this beautiful scene, what kind of feelings are in her heart! The melancholy and shyness of spring are the natural emotions of a young girl, a kind of graceful state that is inadvertently revealed. Liu Mengmei enters the dream by the plum blossoms, and they are tender and affectionate with each other, "provoking bee sorrow and butterfly love, a predestined fate of three lifetimes." It is not necessary to have the event, but it is impossible not to have this music.

(2) "Seeing the Moon" (Spread Gold Character Order): "Dusk is near, the courtyard is filled with faint mist; the clear night is quiet, the sound of the bell drips into the empty quiet; a sorrowful person, who will pity him?" This describes Emperor Tang Minghuang returning to the western capital after the rebellion, looking up at the bright moon, thinking of his beloved concubine, and feeling extremely sad. The word "Huang" (yellow) should be sung with a slight touch of black (乌) and yellow (黄) sound. "Hun" (dusk) should be pronounced as "hu wen qie," and "jin" (near) should be pronounced as "qi yi yin qie." This is a Changsan eye (a musical term), which is extremely pleasant to listen to. It is also a solo performance for a government official, and very few people sing it. I have heard one person sing it in Haining, and only one or two people in Shanghai can sing it. Later, there is a song called "Night Rain Striking the Wutong Tree," which is as mournful as the cuckoo's cry, with a feeling that shakes the Qiong Valley.

(3) "Tragic Sight" (Tipping Cup Jade Hibiscus): "Packing up the great land and rivers in a single load, the four elements are all empty; having experienced the vast journey, the desolate plain; the piled up mountains, the rolling Yangtze River." This is when Yongle usurped the throne, and Emperor Jianwen, together with Cheng Ji, disguised himself as a monk, avoided Xiangyang, and saw countless loyal officials being killed along the way, all of whom were former ministers, and the common people were supporting the old and carrying the young, wandering and displaced. This play is commonly known as "Eight Yang," with eight songs before and after, rhyming with "Yang." In the early Republic era, many people sang it. The meaning of the words is broad-minded, and passed down to this day, it is like an ornament of the times.

(4) "Breaking Willow at Yangguan" (Golden Bell): "How much spring weaving is left? The embroidered battle clothes are personally given to the men." The separation of husband and wife makes people sad! Today's travelers on long journeys should also feel it in their hearts. Seeing the farewell at the barracks in Beijing opera is too much like adding feet to a snake (unnecessary). The emotion in Kunqu is seen in the lyrics, which are gentle and without agitation. The dialogue is also quite fitting. Huo Xiaoyu sends Li Yi to Ba Bridge, and they look at each other across the green willows, so there are the lingering words: "Tell him to not leave his sword wherever he goes through the passes, and ask him to send letters to home when he meets people on the post road." All of this requires careful study of the lyrics. It cannot be understood at a glance, so the music is high and few people can sing along. Common people often cannot understand it and look down on it.

Random Notes from the Pear Garden

### Tao Xiaoting reduced to Beggary

— Mei Yi

The old Kunqu opera actor Tao Xianting has a son named Xiaoting, who used to fill minor roles in the Rongqing Society Kunqu troupe. Sometimes he played the flute as a guest performer. Although the income was not very good, he was not reduced to beggary. According to a letter from a friend in Tianjin, Tao Xiaoting became addicted to bad habits last year, and later also smoked drugs. Recently, he was suddenly heard to be begging on the streets. Tao's relatives and friends, seeing Xiaoting willingly falling, all turned their noses and passed by, unwilling to offer help. According to reports, it is not uncommon for people in the Pear Garden to beg. There was Zhao Shengbi, a famous martial artist who graduated from Fu Society, who died of a drug overdose last year, and a certain female performer who once enjoyed great fame. Xiaoting is just one of them. The reason for their downfall is all due to drug use. People in the Pear Garden are mostly addicted to bad habits. Should they not be alert after reading this news?

### Examination of Characters in the "Confucius" Film (1)

— Drawn by Tianye, Written by Qingniao

Preface: During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the world was in decline. Although the Zhou Dynasty had the name of the Son of Heaven, it had no real power to rule. The feudal lords divided the world, established their hegemony, fought and killed each other, killed their rulers and fathers. For more than two hundred years, rebellions did not cease. Confucius was born in this era. As a commoner, he traveled everywhere, lecturing on faith and righteousness, verbally criticizing and writing articles. His words and deeds are enough to serve as a model for all generations. Last October, when the sun was bright and the leaves were turning dark, the Shanghai Minhua Film Company specially produced "Confucius," a film about the lifelong struggles of the Sage, directed by Mr. Fei Mu, with a serious and careful attitude. At this time and in this place, this is especially commendable. Before the film is released, this publication will specially introduce the characters in the film, publishing it over six days, and we hope that readers will pay attention to it.

Confucius, named Qiu, styled Zhongni, was a native of Lu. He was born in 1462 BC, the twenty-first year of King Ling of Zhou, and died in the forty-first year of King Jing of Zhou, at the age of seventy-three. He was born 551 years earlier than Jesus Christ and six years later than Sakyamuni. The Master "matches virtue with heaven and earth and caps his way with ancient and modern," taking propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love as the foundation of his life, and rectifying his heart and making his intentions sincere as the beginning of governing his family, ruling his state, and pacifying the world. Where great righteousness lay, he never tired of teaching, struggling all his life, until his death. Later generations respected him and honored him as the national teacher.
