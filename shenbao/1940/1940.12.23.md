The sole mission of the commission is "to increase the highest possible speed of production based on America's resources, manpower, business talents, and industry, so that we can achieve victory. We ask the public to deeply recognize this crisis, which is the very reason for the establishment of this committee."

The dispatch states that this is President Roosevelt of the United States showing the world how great his hopes are for the new ambassador to France.

### Washington's Increased Aid to Britain Provokes Serious Resentment from Germany, US Authorities Consider Requisitioning Foreign Ships for British Use, Germany Calls it Provocation and Humiliation, Says it Can No Longer be Tolerated

London: US-German relations suddenly deteriorated yesterday because the German government requested the United States to recall two personnel from the US Embassy in Paris who had pro-British behavior. Furthermore, the German Foreign Office spokesman told foreign journalists that British Shipping Minister Cross recently made a statement requesting the United States to confiscate enemy ships in the United States and transfer them to Britain. Germany is now closely watching how the United States will respond to this request. US Secretary of State Hull replied yesterday to the first point, stating that three members of the Paris Embassy staff could be recalled. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

New York: According to Berlin radio, a German government spokesman stated that US aid to Britain is completely unjustified and can no longer be tolerated, and that what he said was the opinion of the government. The spokesman mentioned the US government's recall of the First and Second Secretaries and female clerk Diggin from the US Embassy in Paris, saying that their activities were only one type of action by the United States or its appointed officials that endangered German security. The German government side said that the German government is now preparing startling documents accusing the embassy personnel, and will soon disclose the details of their activities. A Berlin official spokesman claimed that if the United States requisitions German ships in the United States and sells them to Britain, Germany will regard it as an act of war. Germany is now closely watching this situation, which is of great importance to German interests. Germany has restrained itself to the point of self-harm, while the United States continues to adopt policies of irritation, provocation, humiliation, and moral oppression. According to this declaration, Germany is watching President Roosevelt's actions to decide whether to participate in the war, except for his plan to aid Britain. This is the first candid disclosure that we have crossed the limit set by Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry's attack yesterday on the US for "moral invasion" has been anticipated by journalists here in recent days. The person who made this statement admitted to being a representative and responsible spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry, which attracted the attention of the foreign reporters present. The press had originally expected Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to make a declaration, but since British Shipping Minister Cross made a speech in the House of Commons on Friday, the German side immediately took this opportunity as a point of attack. Cross called for an increase in ships built by the United States to compensate for the loss of British ships at sea, so the German Foreign Ministry stated, "That country harbors special affection for one of the belligerent nations while slandering, biting, challenging, and humiliating the other belligerent nation. This moral invasion of Germany has reached an intolerable level." Events occurring simultaneously and remotely echoing this type of statement include Foreign Minister Matsuoka's strong remarks on the Far East situation on Wednesday, Japan's reappointment of Oshima as Ambassador to Germany, and the recent establishment of a mixed committee of the three Axis powers, all of which are noteworthy. Furthermore, the German government has announced that it has asked the US government to recall several of its diplomatic personnel, including Mrs. Diggin, a receptionist at the US Embassy in Paris, who was accused of assisting a British military officer to escape from a military prison. There are also US Commercial Attaché Hans and Accounting Attaché Cross, who were accused of harboring British spies in the embassy for months. The German official news agency claimed that the spies were eventually arrested by the police and had confessed everything. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Washington: US authorities are now striving to find a legal basis for the government to take over ships. It is widely believed that after the ships are requisitioned, they will be handed over to Britain. It is reported that the law currently being studied by the authorities is the Espionage Act of 1917. According to this law, if the appearance or activities of foreign ships in US territorial waters conflict with US policy, the President has the authority to take them over. It is also reported that the provision in the International and US Industrial Requisitioning Act, which stipulates that the state enjoys central rights and requisitioning rights over all domestic industries, is also being studied by the US authorities. When Secretary of State Hull was asked about the reaction in Berlin, Hull replied that he did not want to criticize the reaction. Observers in Washington believe that no matter what the Berlin Foreign Ministry says, it will not affect the policies currently being discussed or decided by the US authorities. The US authorities are now giving full consideration to the issue of ships inside and outside US territorial waters, and a decision is expected within a few days. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Washington: People here have not paid much attention to Germany's attacks yesterday on US aid to Britain. Some outsiders believe that this is Germany expressing to the American people its anger about the matter and making the German people understand the deep impact of this situation on Germany. Secretary of State Hull said yesterday regarding the German government's request for the United States to recall three personnel from the US Embassy in Paris, that any government has the right to ask another government to recall the personnel it has sent without giving its reasons. The State Department will investigate the matters stated by Germany, but a preliminary investigation has not found that this person helped the British escape from France. Hull declined to comment on Berlin's statement that Germany would consider it an unfriendly act if the US requisitioned ships outside US territorial waters for Britain. In fact, the German Foreign Ministry's accusations will not only not cause the United States to back down, but will also cause American leaders to strengthen their aid attitude. Because the US policy towards Britain is consistent with its goals in the Far East and Central and South America. Japan's repeated declaration of its alliance with the Axis powers forces the United States to pay close attention to US interests in the Pacific and East Asia. The Congressman from Massachusetts, Hamilton, said, "No matter how Germany complains, the United States will decide its own steps to protect American interests." He also said, "If Germany wants to improve friendship, it can first stop anti-American and espionage activities in the United States." Hamilton believed that Congress would not approve the proposal to confiscate German and Italian ships remaining in the US and transfer them to Britain. This proposal has been very noisy recently, including 28 German ships, 27 Italian ships, 37 Danish ships, and 28 French ships, but it has not been formally submitted. A high official said, "The authorities have already studied it. If there is no legal conflict, it would have been transferred to Britain long ago." (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Chongqing Newspaper Comments on Japanese Political Situation

Chongqing: The Central Daily News this morning carried an article discussing the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, which is now increasingly leaning towards the extreme right wing, stating that Hiruma's appointment as Minister of Home Affairs and Araki's appointment as a Minister Without Portfolio are Prime Minister Konoe's attempts to appease the extreme right-wing elements. The Konoe cabinet is actually Japan's last resort, and the inclusion of extreme right-wing elements in the cabinet is also Konoe's last resort. If another major political upheaval occurs in Japan, the Konoe cabinet will inevitably collapse along with it. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Editorial

### Reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet and Future Trends

This autumn, Konoe's re-emergence on the stage was something that, among Japan's last three or four prime ministers, was relatively the most supported by all parties in Japan; Konoe himself also had great confidence, harboring major ambitions, preparing to use astonishing measures to transition the struggling Japan to a completely new situation; However, for five months, everything has not gone as expected, and although its internal and external operations have been bolder than any of its predecessors, its own situation has become increasingly difficult; As a result, Konoe's personal prestige has also greatly declined with the passage of time, extravagant hopes have turned into resentment, and support has turned into attacks; From the military right wing to some industrial capitalists, they have all focused their arrows on Konoe and expressed their dissatisfaction, making the Japanese political situation particularly turbulent. Recently, the military has openly expressed its support for the government, and the cabinet has also been reorganized, thinking that the turmoil in the Japanese political situation may come to a temporary end, and Konoe's response to this problem also shows his painstaking efforts; But whether the fundamental unrest in Japanese politics can be eliminated as a result, and whether Japan's future difficulties can be slightly reduced, remains a major question.

Looking at Konoe's past handling of political affairs: being idealistic and daring to act are its comparative advantages over other contemporary authorities in Japan; However, being idealistic and overly mysterious, and being brave and extremely fragile, are its major weaknesses. The fundamental problem is that although Konoe's vision is deeper than those who are solely focused on quick success and instant benefit, at best it can only work to fill the gaps for the radicals, and at first it was unable to create new opportunities outside the scope of the military, aiming at the true interests of Japan and intending to get to the root of the problem, and under the control of extreme advocacy. On the contrary, it lacks the ability to cope with situations like Takahashi Saito in the past. It goes without saying that the July 7th Incident broke out during Konoe's term; This time, when he took office again, he signed two treaties before and after September 27th and November 30th, which were certainly something that his predecessors did not dare to do, but the result was only an increase in international resentment and pressure, and did not make Japan gain any real benefits. Furthermore, in terms of internal measures, the New Structure Movement, which he used to call for, has actually deteriorated since it was renamed the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. It is neither a political system reform nor a one-party movement, but merely formed a kind of official political organization mostly led by bureaucrats, and its nature and function are still not very certain. In the meantime, there are factional oppositions and personnel disputes, which have not improved at all compared to the era of political parties, and the constitutional norms and the political party system have been completely destroyed, resulting in the peculiar phenomenon that the 76th Diet only has a members' club and no political parties. Konoe himself seems to have greatly reduced his interest in this and does not pay much attention to it. As for the most difficult foreign policy issue for Japan, the Japanese authorities have fully demonstrated their inability to advance or retreat and their lack of direction. The call to be friendly to the Soviet Union once reached a high pitch, and Tatekawa went to his post amidst enthusiastic farewells, but the stalemate remains to this day, and anti-Soviet arguments have risen again. As for US-Japan relations, Konoe and Matsuoka once challenged in the front, and then softened in the back. Recently, on the one hand, they hope that Nomura will ease US-Japan relations, but views that offend the US side continue to be expressed in writing, and the path for Nomura to carry out his mission will be completely blocked. Moreover, the deterioration of Japanese-US relations has aggravated Japan's economic difficulties, and the recent Japanese government's plan to control industry and commerce and foreign trade will make the rift between the government and the zaibatsu capitalists increasingly deep. All of these situations show that although Konoe is doing his best to use his ideals, in reality his plans are always misguided and only enough to increase his current difficulties.

This reorganization of the Japanese cabinet is, in form, a retreat of bureaucratic forces and an advance of military fascism, which is the reward the military has received for announcing its support for the cabinet. However, to use right-wing military men for the judiciary and to rely on big figures like Hiranuma for internal affairs shows that the internal unrest in Japan is urgently relying on this reorganized cabinet to strengthen its internal control, and its intention is naturally to prepare for future external adventures; Therefore, in addition to the cabinet reorganization, it is also conceivable that the Japanese government's policies will inevitably change accordingly. It was rumored some time ago that right-wing elements were dissatisfied with the three ministers Matsuoka, Kawa, and Kobayashi for not being strong and radical enough. Although these three ministers have not been replaced, Matsuoka's speech at the farewell to Nomura on the 19th and his conversation with reporters on the 9th have shown a degree of difference. In addition, coinciding with the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, the connection between Japan and the Axis powers is also strengthening. What has been shown in fact is that the Ministry of the Army is sending a military delegation to Germany and Italy for inspection, the technical committee stipulated by the Three-Power Alliance will be established in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo respectively, and the position of Ambassador to Germany was formerly held by Oshima Hiroshi, who had previously promoted the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact and consistently advocated strengthening the Axis alliance. It has been three months since the establishment of the Tripartite Pact, and these measures have suddenly been realized at this time, which can also somewhat explain the future trends of the Japanese side. The so-called easing of relations with the United States is basically nothing more than a smokescreen. The Japanese have probably come to a considerable understanding of the resolute attitude of the United States; Therefore, although the decline of the Axis front has increased unabated, the Japanese side cannot regard the rumored German offensive next spring as the basis for its future attempts. Its recent moves are nothing more than intensifying preparations for this future.

### One Week of War Situation: December 15th to 21st

Chongqing: The military spokesman stated that in the past week, the Chinese army has often taken the initiative to inflict heavy damage on the Japanese. The war situations in various places are as follows:

The Japanese outer outposts in Fenxi, Hongdong, Xiangling, Xinjiang, Wenxi, Xiaxian, and other places on both sides of the railway have been constantly attacked by the Chinese army, and Japanese casualties are estimated at over two thousand. On the morning of the 16th, the Chinese air force flew to bomb Japanese bases and military material warehouses between Anyi and Yuncheng, and all were hit by bombs and burned down. Between Guanxi Guyang An, more than a thousand Japanese troops attacked Xiantai Liang, but were completely defeated by the Chinese army. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to Guyang.

The Chinese army destroyed one Japanese locomotive and three carriages between Gu'ao and Xiajiatang near Yuezhou, killing the Japanese officers and soldiers. The Japanese troops in Luojiawan Yangshuliwan and other places near Yichang have been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army in recent days and have suffered considerable casualties, with more than a dozen trucks carrying more than five hundred corpses to Shayang for cremation. The Chinese army near Shashi has also inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese army from time to time. In the Battle of Guanmingkou, twenty grain ships and many guns, ammunition, and documents were captured. The Japanese troops attacking Banzhupu north of the Jing-Sha Road have been pursued to Zhujiapu and surrounded. The traffic and power lines from Hougang to Shizhuoqiao have been destroyed. There are many anti-war slogans written by Japanese soldiers along the way from Zhongxiang to Hanchuan, which shows that the Japanese soldiers are disheartened and vulnerable. Pengjiawan in Mianyang, Shaomaoshan in Chongyang, and Ningming Mountain in Tongcheng have all been captured by the Chinese army. The Japanese outposts between Huayuan and Guangshui were attacked, killing more than two hundred Japanese soldiers.

### Vichy Diplomatic Observers Say: France is Willing to Negotiate with Thailand, Hoping for a More Concrete Expression from Thailand. Thai Military Attack on French Island Results in Failure.

Vichy: Regarding the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, diplomatic observers here recently commented that the repeated border incidents between Thailand and Vietnam are regrettable. However, up to this point, no serious consequences have arisen, primarily due to the moderate attitude of the French authorities. The Governor-General of Vietnam has limited his response to the hostile actions of the Thai authorities to retaliation. Judging from the repeated statements issued by the Thai government, it is clear that the Thai authorities do not wish to reopen negotiations with the Vietnamese authorities according to the principles decided in June of this year. If Thailand can express this intention more concretely, the French Chargé d'Affaires in Thailand, Mr. Gachot, will find it easy to negotiate with Thailand. (21st Havas Dispatch)

### Japan's New Political Structure Deprives People of the Right to Vote. It Has Now Caused Resistance from the National Public. There Will Be FierCE Debate on This in the Current Diet.

Tokyo: Japanese political leaders, attempting to realize the so-called "restoration of Japan's true principles," are currently proposing a new plan to amend the previous election laws. Once this new plan is approved, it will deprive four million voters of the right to vote. This new plan, which has already caused major resistance, focuses on Japan's traditional family system and is based on Japan's old ideas to create a modern country. Although this plan has the appearance of totalitarianism, it actually seeks to transform the fundamental principles of Japan that have been implemented for more than a hundred years. Although Japan had the shogunate system and dictatorship system before Europe tried the dictatorial system, modern Japanese leaders do not say that Japan is restoring this shogunate concept, but these people have said that all new developments are completely Japanese in nature. When Cabinet Information Minister Ito spoke with foreign reporters, he strongly stated that Western and Eastern ideas are completely different. "For example, in Britain and the United States, you all say that voting is the right to vote," but in Japan, we believe that voting is "the obligation to vote." Therefore, we do not feel any difficulty in depriving millions of people of the right to vote. Those who are instructed to vote will fulfill their obligations to the country, and this obligation should be fulfilled by the heads of each family. The proposal to change the election law has been considered for many years. This did not happen yesterday or the day before. We have been proceeding for a long time, and finally, we made a plan to submit to the Diet. The reporters asked Ito about the differences between Japan's new institutions and European-style totalitarianism. Ito said that this is completely different from European ideas. "Because we want to firmly build our country's government concepts and procedural concepts in every way of life. These concepts have been submerged in darkness for seventy years. We have promoted these concepts to make them clearer than before. Today is the most appropriate time. The system of the Meiji era worked very well at that time. If we make some slight changes, it is also to adapt to the modern world, because fundamentally they are the same." According to reports, the last major revision of Japan's election law was the adoption of universal male suffrage in 1925. This reform increased the number of voters in the 1928 general election from 3.3 million to 12.5 million. The current estimate is 14 million. As for women, they have no voting rights in Japan. The government's plan at this time will also allow men serving in the army and navy who are over 25 years old to have the right to vote even if they are not the head of a family, and will reduce the number of members of the House of Representatives from 466 to 300. Such a sharp reform has aroused severe criticism in political circles. It is expected that there will be a fierce debate on this proposal in the Diet. The Japanese government's plan is the result of building a so-called "new political structure" that gives Japan a totalitarian color. The Japanese government has told the public that this plan is not only to improve the quality of voters and members of parliament, but also to maintain Japan's family system. Because of these purposes, the government's new plan is supported by the military and right-wing elements. The Japanese cabinet's claim that limiting the right to vote to heads of households over the age of 25 is sufficient to improve the quality of voters has aroused debate among many people. The so-called head of household often refers to the head of household registered on the census form. If so, the eldest son in the family over the age of 25 will not have the right to vote if his father is still alive. Currently, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Mr. Ishiguro, who is 56 years old, and the newly appointed Cabinet Information Department spokesperson, Mr. Ishii, will also be deprived of the right to vote. Newspapers here also believe that if this system is implemented, the country will lose most of the knowledgeable voters. Opponents of the government's plan also claim that this system will not only fail to maintain the family system, but will have the opposite result. Because if there are two brothers in a family, the younger brother must rise up and separate from the original family to form another family in order to obtain the right to vote, which will result in the dispersal of the members of the family and the loss of the advantages of the family. Also, the "Daily News" stated that the government's special permission for men serving in the military to have the right to vote is obviously discriminating against men who have not served in the military. Military service is the duty of citizens in Japan and has been written into the conscription law. How can those who have not served in the active service know that they cannot serve the country in other ways? (22nd United Press Dispatch)

### Unemployed Japanese Merchants Migrating to Manchuria

Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to migrate 5,000 middle-level merchants and peddlers, who have had to change their occupations due to the reorganization of economic institutions, to "Manchukuo." It has been decided that 300 rice merchants and charcoal merchants from Yamanashi Prefecture will go to "Manchukuo" on February 11th of next year, National Foundation Day. 150 merchants from Nagoya Prefecture are also being trained by the authorities and will depart soon. In addition, 60 confectioners, pharmacists, photographers, carpenters, and weavers are also in training. (21st Havas Dispatch)

### Discovery of Antimony Ore on the Seabed Near Myojima Island Cancelled

Tokyo: A certain mining company in Osaka discovered antimony ore on the seabed near Myojima Island and requested permission from the Osaka Mining Administration to use explosives to mine on the seabed. Local fishermen strongly opposed this, saying that after the seabed is bombed, fish will be frightened and flee, and the livelihoods of fishermen will be affected. The two sides argued endlessly. The Osaka Mining Survey Office conducted a very careful test. Afterwards, it was said that if explosives were used at a depth of 45 to 75 centimeters below the seabed, with long intervals between each blast, it would not frighten the fish away. A storm was finally calmed. (22nd Havas Dispatch)

American Construction of Submersible Cargo Ships for Exclusive Use by Britain to Avoid Sea Attacks

New York: Mr. Lake, an old inventor of submarines, is now planning to build a type of submersible cargo ship that travels underwater to avoid sea attacks. Lake has requested a sum of 200 million dollars to build 100 ships first, helping Britain avoid the threat of German submarines. It is said that each submersible cargo ship can carry 7,000 tons of cargo. Lake told people that because German submarines will sink all British seagoing vessels, the only way to deal with it is to build cargo ships that travel underwater. (22nd Haitong Dispatch)

### German Troops Enter Albanian Territory. News of Aiding Italian Operations Confirmed. Greek Troops Brave Heavy Snow and Advance Courageously, Breaking Through the Italian Defense Line at Tepelene.

Rome: The Italian High Command announced this morning that the Italian fleet sailed through the Ionian Sea yesterday and heavily bombarded several parts of the Greek coast. At the same time, Italian newspapers and authoritative sources stated that thousands of troops from the German and Italian armies in various war zones are currently being transferred back and forth. Some sources strongly stated that Germany has sent 45,000 troops and multiple aircraft to aid the Italian army in Albania. (22nd International Dispatch)

Split: According to unconfirmed news from the front lines, three Italian transport ships full of German troops sailed from Bari on the southeastern coast of Italy to Durazzo, an important coastal town in the west. It is said that there are 25,000 German troops stationed in Trieste, Pilingisi, and Bari. It is also reported that 25 German planes, including five Stuka aircraft, recently arrived in northern Italy. (It is believed here that this report is only a rumor from the former capital in the south.) (22nd United Press Dispatch)

Cairo: Officials here stated yesterday that Germany has sent 45,000 troops and several Stuka dive bombers and troop transport planes to aid the Italian army in Albania. The Italian authorities said that Albania, Britain, the Adriatic Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean are merely different battle lines in the same conflict. This is the principle on which the Axis powers are acting. Therefore, Germany and Italy are now exchanging manpower and resources as much as possible. It is said that "hundreds of Italian pilots and Italian planes are currently fighting in the skies over the English Channel. In this regard, the German troops' deployment to Albania is a mutual aid operation and should not be considered strange." It is heard that "new types of Italian planes will be manufactured soon. The characteristics of these aircraft are derived from the experience of Italian and British aircraft in air combat over Britain. It is widely believed that most of these new types of aircraft will eventually be transported to Germany." It is pointed out that "before the new Italian aircraft are built, the Italian army is using a large number of German bombers to attack the Greek army. Their sharpness far exceeds any of the newest British aircraft used in Albania." (22nd International News Agency Dispatch)

Athens: It is announced here that last night, Greek troops, in the cold weather, braved heavy snow and charged with bayonets and hand grenades, cutting off the defense line of the Italian stronghold of Tepelene in southern Albania and attacking it from the side. Greek sources say that two strategically important highlands in the Këlcyrë-Tepelene-Grykohovë triangle area have been occupied by Greek troops. As a result, Greek troops were able to capture two more villages and repel Italian troops in several areas along the Tepelene-Grykohovë front. (22nd International News Agency Dispatch)

Athens: The 3,000 reinforcements that the Italian army ships to the Albanian front every day seem to be able to prevent the progress of the Greek army. The Greek army used to be unstoppable, but recently the Italian army has been resisting fiercely. There has been no progress in the front-line battles. However, the Greek army was able to repel the Italian army's fierce attack in the coastal area yesterday and is still attacking Këlcyrë. Fierce fighting is still going on in the Tepelene and Grykohovë areas. The Italian army is fighting very hard. It is said that the vicinity of these two cities has been reduced to ruins. (22nd United Press Dispatch)

### British Troops Gather on the Banks of the Nile. Fierce Fighting on the Bardia Front.

London: According to news from the African British Army front, two Italian divisions are still holding Bardia. Soon, the main forces of both sides will engage in a new battle line. According to Rome Radio, there are a total of 425,000 British troops in the Nile, supplemented by 1,500 aircraft. It is heard that light warships from the British Navy in the Mediterranean Sea sailed into the inner harbor of Bardia under heavy artillery fire and sank three Italian supply ships. British destroyers and cruisers also opened fire and bombarded docks and military camps. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)

Rome: According to reports from the North African front, the Italian army is currently trying to block the British army's advance towards Bardia, and the British army is trying to expand the North African front. According to reports from the capital of Abyssinia, the British army has concentrated 100,000 troops in the Red Sea, including reserves from Kenya in Central Africa, and will attack Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland from both sides. (22nd United Press Dispatch)

Cairo: Fierce battles broke out between the British and Italian armies near Bardia yesterday. The British army seems to have gradually gained the upper hand and is tightening its grip on the Italian positions. The Italian army is desperately defending a 14-mile coastal position, but it is widely believed that once the British army launches a fierce attack, the Italian army's resistance is likely to disappear. The British Navy is bombarding the city of Bardia 24 hours a day, which an Italian prisoner described as "more ferocious than Mount Vesuvius." At the same time, the artillery under the command of General Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in the Middle East, is constantly bombarding the Italian defenses. The last route from Bardia to Tobruk in the east has been cut off by the British army. British armored car units have also penetrated deep into various parts of Libya, pursuing the retreating Italian army. (22nd United Press Dispatch)

### British Aircraft Conduct Extensive Operations

Cairo - Last night, the British Air Force communiqué released here announced that British aircraft in the Middle East had shot down another five enemy planes. It was reported that on Friday night, heavy bombers attacked the Berk airfield in Libya, causing fires and affecting buildings and hangars. Two enemy planes also caught fire. Subsequently, the airfield was strafed. On the same night, British aircraft also attacked the Gazala airfield, bombing planes parked there. One British bomber did not return. During patrol missions, British fighters shot down three enemy planes. British bombers were also quite active over Albania, attacking Berat. British fighters intercepted a squadron of enemy bombers over the Tepelene region and are believed to have shot down one. One British plane was also lost, but the pilot was unharmed. In another aerial battle between British fighters and enemy bombers, three enemy planes were shot down. British planes also attacked oil tanks in Brindisi, southern Italy. Visibility was poor and anti-aircraft fire was intense, making clear observation difficult, but bombs were seen exploding in the target area, followed by large fires and multiple explosions. Goramaia Daga, Midanma, Asab, and Taesini in Italian East Africa were all attacked. (Reuters, 22nd)

London - In the first twelve days of the Western Desert campaign, Italy lost at least 144 planes, while the British lost only 12, with five British pilots rescued. This represents the battle record of the Royal Air Force in Egypt from December 7th to 19th, when they achieved victory against overwhelming odds while supporting the army. Eighty-eight Italian planes were destroyed in combat, and fifty-six were destroyed or captured on the ground. During these twelve days, British fighters constantly coordinated with the vanguard, and every Italian airfield from Derna to Sidi Barrani was subjected to intense bombing by British aircraft, lasting for several days. On the 11th, the Blackshirts retreating towards Sollum were strafed by British aircraft, resulting in a chaotic rout. For the next 72 hours, British aircraft used harassment tactics against the Italian forces day and night, further demoralizing the Italian troops and exacerbating transportation disruptions. On the 15th, poor weather prevented British aircraft from taking off, but the next day, with clear skies, British aircraft resumed operations, shooting down ten Italian planes. British land forces also captured fifteen Italian planes unable to take off at an airfield near Sollum. On the 17th, heavy rain fell in the Western Desert, but that night, British aircraft launched an extremely intense attack on the Benina airfield, destroying at least eight enemy planes. The following night, British aircraft attacked an enemy camp in Derna, setting it completely on fire. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Weak Italian Naval Strength

London - Newspapers here believe that the British Navy's foray into the Adriatic Sea to bombard the port of Valona has dealt a major blow to Mussolini's prestige. The "Daily Telegraph" stated that one of the purposes of Mussolini joining the war was to fulfill his demand to establish the Mediterranean as "Our Sea." However, six months after the start of the war, not only has this goal not been achieved, but even the name of the Adriatic Sea as an Italian inland sea is no longer applicable. The Italian fleet in the Mediterranean Sea largely appears to be abandoning the war. Italy has no shortage of material or manpower; what it lacks is the courage to fight and a real reason to fight. The "Daily Mail" stated that the British Navy has demonstrated that the Italian Navy cannot defend the Adriatic coast, just as it cannot protect Italian lines of communication. (Reuters, 22nd)

Rome - The Director of the Italian Technical Exchange Office, Volpi, suggested exchanging technical personnel between Germany and Italy, with electrical industry technicians being exchanged first. (Haitong Agency, 22nd)

### In Eight Months, the British Air Force Achieved 6,000 Attacks on German and Italian Targets from the European Coastline to Poland

London - In the past eight months, the British Air Force has attacked a total of 5,000 targets from the ports of the English Channel to the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea, inflicting widespread destruction on Germany, Italy, and their territories. Four-fifths of these attacks were directed at Germany and German-controlled lands, with 250 of them targeting aircraft and munitions factories, greatly hindering Germany's efforts to replenish its massive losses in air warfare. German shipyards and harbor vessels, including flat-bottomed boats being rapidly prepared for the invasion of Britain, suffered 866 large-scale air raids. German land and waterway transportation was also attacked 683 times. German airfields were attacked 813 times. These air raids originated from various points along the European coast and extended deep into Poland. The British Air Force lost a total of 550 aircraft, but in addition to suffering significant damage, Germany also lost 109 aircraft in its own skies. Since the outbreak of the Albanian and African campaigns, the British Air Force's offensive against Italy has gradually intensified. Since Italy joined the war, the British Air Force's attacks on Italy have also been quite successful, with 406 attacks on Abyssinia, Eritrea, and Somaliland, 300 attacks on Libya, and 60 attacks on Italian munitions depots, troop locations, and important ports in Albania. The Italian fleet and merchant fleet were attacked 55 times. British aircraft have also repeatedly made non-stop flights of 2,000 miles to attack industrial centers in northern Italy. Italy is experiencing the power of the British Air Force just as Germany is. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Germany Demands Vichy Government Reorganization Through War Threat, Government Must Obey and Move to Paris, Pétain Said to be Considering Escape to North Africa

Vichy - Reliable sources here stated yesterday that Germany has warned France that if the Vichy government does not reorganize itself, eliminate its Nazi elements, and move the capital back to Paris, placing it entirely under Nazi control, then Germany is prepared to tear up the armistice and resume active warfare. The same sources stated that Germany is demanding a dual guarantee from France, including the following points, as the price for the continued armistice agreement: (1) The Pétain government should dismiss senior officials deemed to be opposed to the Franco-German cooperation policy. (2) The Vichy government should move back to Paris under Nazi control, so as to constantly consult with Nazi officials in Paris; otherwise, if it remains in Vichy, it must be subject to strict German control. Well-informed sources stated that it is widely believed that French Prime Minister Marshal Pétain will reject Germany's demands. The difficult situation between France and Germany has reached a critical stage yesterday. The Pétain cabinet met for several hours to consider this decision. News from London stated that it is generally believed that Marshal Pétain and the ministers supporting Pétain are now considering escaping to North Africa if the Germans do not reduce their demands and a solution cannot be found. It is reported that General Weygand, who replaced General Gamelin as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, resided in North Africa for several weeks shortly before France surrendered, leading well-armed troops. London also reported that Germany has made a request to France for passage, allowing German troops to pass through unoccupied French territory to the northern border of Italy, and has also requested the use of the French Navy and other naval bases in the Mediterranean Sea. It is stated here that resuming a state of war would give Führer Hitler a legitimate basis to send troops through France. (International Dispatch, 22nd)

### France Promulgates New Laws to Unite Colonies

Vichy - It has been officially announced that the government will soon promulgate a new law to regulate professional activities within overseas colonies and place the economic life of the entire French Empire under a cooperative system. The main idea is to divide the entire economy into six sectors, namely agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, commerce, transportation, and credit. Then, six organizations will be formed according to this classification to separately regulate various professional activities within the entire empire. The representatives of these six organizations will jointly form a central committee to maintain contact with similar organizations within the motherland. The central committee will have a chairman and a secretary-general, both appointed by the government. A commissioner appointed by the government will also attend each meeting. (Havas Agency, 22nd)

### Under the Bright Moonlight, British Aircraft Fiercely Attack Berlin, Debris Piles Up Like Mountains in the German Capital, Large Fires Break Out in London and Other Places

London - On Friday night, with bright moonlight and snow on the ground in Berlin, British bombers flew in to bomb with extraordinary bravery, sometimes flying as low as 100 feet, almost skimming the rooftops, so they could see the extent of the damage. One pilot, who flew over a major station in Berlin at an altitude of less than 1,000 feet, said he witnessed bombs hitting the middle of the station, sending debris flying high. When his plane was caught in searchlights and anti-aircraft fire, it dived down, and the gunners in the front and rear aimed and fired hundreds of rounds, destroying the anti-aircraft guns. The main targets of the British attack were Berlin's factories, warehouses, and stations. One aircraft factory was attacked first, and later British aircraft, guided by the firelight, launched a major attack, causing fires in many places and explosions. The area on fire stretched for half a mile, and the flames could be seen 50 miles away. A major fire also broke out in Berlin's largest and newest Westhafen shipyard. A large lumberyard was burned down. The last batch of British aircraft flew away from Berlin after 6:30 AM yesterday. (Reuters, 22nd)

Intense Aerial Bombardment Between British and German Air Forces

London - Nazi bomber squadrons launched a second night of sustained bombing on Liverpool on the River Mersey last night, clearly seeking to retaliate for the British Air Force's bombing of Berlin. This was the most destructive air raid since the start of the war. Other German squadrons attacked London and various parts of Britain, with Liverpool being their primary target. Tons of incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs were dropped. At the same time, it is believed that the British Air Force also launched a fierce attack on several German targets this morning, including Berlin. It is reported that during the bombing of Berlin on Friday night, many large fires broke out, with continuous explosions at motor factories, train stations, and merchandise storage areas. According to British Air Force personnel reports, several roofs in Berlin were torn off, and a fire broke out that was a mile long, with debris piled up like mountains. It is believed that coastal areas of continental Europe were also subjected to heavy bombing early this morning. German long-range artillery fired on the coast of Dover again last night. German planes attacking Liverpool, braving intense British anti-aircraft fire, flew into the city at a rate of one plane every two minutes, bombing throughout the night. The method of attack was similar to that of Coventry, with the attackers first dropping flares, followed by incendiary bombs, and finally high-explosive bombs. In short, Saturday night was one of the largest-scale air raids between the German and British Air Forces since the start of the war. (International News Agency, 22nd)

Significant Damage in the Midlands

Berlin - German authorities announced today that last night and early this morning, the German Air Force dropped hundreds of incendiary and high-explosive bombs on many places in Britain in retaliation for the recent British air raids on Berlin. It is reported that at 2:00 AM this morning, a firestorm was still raging in a certain seaport in western England and a large city in the Midlands. It is reported that hundreds of German planes attacked these two locations, and large fires broke out in both places. These announcements coincide with a time when the German press is expressing extreme anger today, as the famous Royal Christ Church, as well as other ancient monuments in Berlin and Poznan, have been damaged by British aircraft. German newspapers say that the large-scale German air raids on Britain will continue until all British seaports and industrial centers are reduced to ruins. Berlin Radio said today, "According to opinions from all sectors in the Netherlands, London has suffered severe damage, and even if Britain wins the war, it will not be able to recover its former appearance within ten years. It can be seen that after the end of the war, Rotterdam will replace London as the largest port in Europe. Rotterdam's dock facilities are already being restored." The German High Command acknowledged today that Berlin has suffered considerable damage in recent British air raids. (International Dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin Residents Disturbed All Night

Sweden - The Swedish "Dagens Nyheter" Berlin dispatch stated that Berliners hope to avoid air raids during Christmas. They are currently preparing to celebrate Christmas with food strictly distributed by the authorities. People are asking each other if they can avoid going into air raid shelters that night, or some are asking those close to Hitler about this matter. The person replied that if British planes do not sortie, then German planes will not fly out on Christmas. On Friday night, Berlin residents took refuge in air raid shelters all night because many British planes flew over Berlin that night. (Reuters, 22nd)

### The World's Tallest Building, the Palace of Soviets, is Under Construction, 416 Meters High, Exceeding the New York National Building

TASS Special Dispatch - Five years ago, under Stalin's motion, the Soviet Union passed a plan to transform Moscow. Part of this plan has been implemented, aiming to improve the living conditions of Moscow residents. Moscow changes every year. Narrow streets have been replaced by wide avenues. In the past five years, the area of new houses has reached 1.8 million square meters, and one million people have moved into new houses. In addition, 400 schools and 190 nurseries have been added. All streets have been widened by two or three times. Large-scale construction has begun on Gorky Street, Pushkin Square, and Mayakovsky Square. Pedestrian underpasses will be built underground in these two places, four and a half meters deep, with escalators rotating at seven-tenths of a meter per second. New buildings that have been completed include the Moscow Grand Hotel and the office of the People's Committee. At the same time, the suburbs of Moscow have also been completely transformed. The subway train is running smoothly, carrying 100 million passengers in the past five years. The third subway line is under construction. The tram and public bus routes have also increased by 115 kilometers last year. In 1937, the Moscow-Volga Canal was completed, expanding the narrow Moscow River and allowing Volga ships to reach Moscow. The canal has connected the Soviet capital with the Baltic Sea, the White Sea, and the Caspian Sea. Ten new bridges have been built over the Moscow River, one of which is 725 meters long. The foundation of the world's largest building, the Palace of Soviets, has been laid. The palace has a volume of 6.5 million cubic meters, covers an area of 100,000 square meters, and is 416 meters high, exceeding the National Building in New York (407 meters high) and the "Eiffel Tower" in Paris. A 100-meter-high Lenin bronze statue will be built in front of the Palace of Soviets, which can be seen within a 70-kilometer radius.

### Dancing and Banquets Prohibited in Greece During National Crisis

### Random Talks on the European War (27): Hitler and Stalin: A Scene of Military Collusion

In recent years, Soviet Russia's diplomacy has been based on the national policy of "We will not attack unless attacked," striving for self-preservation. Stalin was unwilling to incite his country to join in with others, partly because he was bound by Soviet Russia's national policy. From another perspective, although he had achieved some expected goals in military strategy, there were still many areas in actual tactics that needed to be supplemented and trained. Therefore, Stalin's reluctance to act rashly was not accidental. He crouched in the clouds watching other people fight, truly experiencing a mixture of joy and fear.

Germany, the neighbor of Soviet Russia, has always built its nation with the spirit of Prussia. Their dictator, Hitler, is also a master of grand schemes. Although communism and national socialism cannot be confused, these two "heroes of their time" have already gone through a commendable period. Now, in their "position of extreme power," and considering that war between Germany and the Soviet Union would be mutually destructive, while cooperation would benefit both, it is most reasonable that they cherish each other and work together.

It was also a stroke of fate that shortly after the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, a "dark horse" general from Germany, Schwinnatz, and an obscure general from Soviet Russia, Timoshenko, met in a wheat field in Poland. These two commanders, German and Soviet, debated all the way and found much in common. Because General Schwinnatz, although German, could communicate in Russian, the meeting in the wheat field greatly enhanced their feelings for each other.

Then the Soviet-Finnish War broke out. The Soviet Red Army suffered repeated defeats, and its military prestige plummeted. Stalin, at a loss, had to seek advice from Hitler, asking him to send some military advisors to remedy the crisis. The senior officer in charge of this military advisory group had to be proficient in Russian to be qualified, so Schwinnatz took on this important task. Before Christmas of that year, he led his team to Leningrad. After the German military advisors arrived in Soviet Russia, they inspected the military situation and immediately suggested to the Soviet military authorities that they quickly concentrate their forces to break through the strong Mannerheim Line with all their strength. The Soviet authorities felt that the price of this suggestion from the German military advisors was too high and hesitated. Hitler, for his own reasons, because he was already secretly planning how to invade Norway, informed Stalin of the actual situation on the Finnish front. General Schwinnatz also discussed everything with the Soviet leader in Stalin's study. He bluntly told Stalin that his generals were nothing but political parasites, and that "there was only one outstanding and capable person, and his name was Timoshenko." The unknown General Timoshenko, only a few months after meeting Schwinnatz in the wheat field, and after the bragging of the leader of the German military advisory group, rose rapidly and displayed his talents.

A week after General Schwinnaetz's secret talks with Stalin, General Timoshenko was promoted to commander-in-chief of the front, holding the tiger tally and commanding the three armies. After six weeks of hard fighting with the Finnish army, he finally broke through the Mannerheim Line. Timoshenko defeated Finland, and the Soviet Union's military prestige was greatly boosted. When he triumphed in Moscow, everyone unanimously praised him and hailed him as a national hero. Stalin, overjoyed, awarded him the Order of the Red Star, but temporarily told him to enjoy a leisurely life for a while.

Not long after the end of the Soviet-Finnish War, the German blitzkrieg followed, and wherever the iron cavalry went, all who stood in their way were defeated. After capturing Norway, they immediately advanced into the Netherlands. Before the enemy could catch their breath, the German army had already descended from the sky. France, which was known in Europe as having the first-class army, was also unable to withstand a single blow and signed a treaty of surrender. Stalin, the number one pragmatist, was stunned by the German military strategy, tactics, and weapons, and admired them wholeheartedly. He felt that the old communist traces had to be cleared away and replaced with Hitler's new style.

Once Stalin had this thought, he immediately acted on it. He summoned the shrewd and smooth German ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, and asked him to tell Hitler to allow Schwinnatz to be stationed permanently in Moscow as a special military advisor to the Soviet government. Hitler was delighted to hear this, feeling that Stalin's request would greatly benefit Germany's future actions, and decided to do a favor. He summoned General Schwinnatz to his "Eagle's Nest" in Berchtesgaden, personally instructing him and telling him everything that Germany hoped he would achieve. Hitler's instructions at the time could be divided into two points: (1) Stalin should thoroughly understand that the happiness of Soviet Russia depends on having an elite army that is not swayed by politics; (2) The Soviet army should be led by those who sympathize with Germany.

Schwinnaetz, bearing such an important mission, dared not delay. As soon as he arrived in Moscow, he immediately met with Stalin. The two had a close talk that lasted seven hours. The result of this important meeting was that a Red Army leader was so furious that he nearly fainted, as if he had been punched dozens of times on the head. Voroshilov, the People's Commissar for Defense, whom Stalin relied on as his right-hand man and who had a long history of twelve years, was downgraded to a minor position and placed in a leisurely department. Many officers who clung to their military positions with political means were either dismissed or sent to Siberia. General Timoshenko, the hero of the Soviet-Finnish War, was appointed People's Commissar for Defense and concurrently People's Commissar for the Army. From then on, he had a smooth career, and the Soviet soldiers regarded him as a pillar of strength.

Stalin, who single-handedly made the Soviet Union strong, naturally had many views on Hitler that were different from ordinary people. Stalin had extraordinary skills, and Hitler also had irreplaceable qualities. Indeed, he was the advocate of National Socialism, and Stalin overthrew the Tsarist Russian policy and established communist Soviet Russia. Their willpower, insights, skills, and various aspects were similar; and when the two implemented their national policies, they were decisive and followed the same path. It is no wonder that in Stalin's study, in addition to the statue of Peter the Great adorned with a silver cabinet, there is now a statue of Hitler in a golden cabinet. Heroes recognize heroes, and friends understand each other. The relationship between Stalin and Hitler is probably close to this.

### The Geological Survey of the Academia Sinica Establishes Work Stations in Western Hubei and Western Hunan; Recently Gradually Concentrating in Guilin

(Guilin Correspondence) The Geological Survey of the National Academia Sinica moved to Guilin after the July 7th Incident. To facilitate its work, it established work stations in Badong in Western Hubei and Western Hunan. Recently, it has gradually concentrated in Guilin. The current status of its work is described below:

(1) Western Hubei: In addition to the research on stratigraphy and geological structure, special attention is paid to the mineral resources in southern Western Hubei, especially coal, copper, and iron mines. It is planned to start mining immediately to increase resources. The results of the investigation have been compiled into seven reports: (Yu Deyuan's Report on the Gongjiacun Coalfield in Xingshan, the Report on the Donggong Coalfield in Nanzhang, Xu Jie and Ma Zhentu's Report on the Changyang Coalfield, the Report on the Geological Survey of Yichang Changyang, Li Jie and Wu Yansheng's Brief Report on the Geological Survey of Mineral Resources in Eastern Hubei, the Report on the Glacial Phenomena in the Quaternary Period in Western Hubei and Yu Deyuan and Liu Qingxiang's Brief Report on the Mineral Resources in Hechuan).

(2) Western Hunan: Due to the instability of the region, the results are relatively poor. Only two reports have been completed: A. Li Yuyao and Ma Zhentu's Qingxichong Coalfield in Ningxiang, Hunan; B. Yu Deyuan's Brief Report on the Liulin Gold Mine in Yuanling, Hunan.

(3) Guangxi: Cooperation with the local Department of Construction of the Provincial Government and close liaison with the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Economic Affairs have yielded greater results. The completed reports include Zhang Geng's investigation of the arsenic mines in Shuangcheng Township, Hexian County, Guangxi, and the Shigyuecun Chongbingchong, and the Tungsten mines in Xindu Dagui Mountain, Huaiji Dang Mountain, Fanshishan, and Taipingzhuang, Tengxian County; Si Xingjian's Mesozoic plant fossils in Xiwang, Guangxi, the ancient plants in the Lower Carboniferous of Guangxi, and the distribution of megaphylls in Guangxi; Si Xingjian and Zhang Wuyou's geology of the Dapu Coalfield in Liuyu, Guangxi; the geology of the coalfield in Luocheng Sidou Xiaochang'an, Guangxi; and Zhang Wuyou's geology near Pingle, Guangxi, totaling ten articles.

In addition, part-time researchers are conducting geological research in various parts of Sichuan, and they have gained a lot of experience in salt and oil layers, it is said.

### The Ministry of Education Increases Scholarships for Mongolian and Tibetan Students

(Chongqing Electric Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 21st) According to news from the education sector, the Ministry of Education has decided to increase scholarships for Mongolian and Tibetan students from the next semester. The scholarship for first-class students will be 280 yuan per year, the scholarship for second-class students will be 230 yuan per year, and the scholarship for third-class students will be 110 yuan per year, with an average increase of more than double, so that Mongolian and Tibetan youths can actively come to the mainland to study.

### American Professors from Missionary Schools Return to Their Countries; Graduates Are Hired to Fill the Vacancies; Nineteen Professors Have Left the Four Universities; There Are Many Substitute Teachers and There Is No Difficulty

According to Xinsheng News Agency, as of now, nineteen American teachers from the four missionary universities in Shanghai, namely Shanghai University, St. John's University, Soochow University, and Hangchow University, have resigned, withdrawn, and returned to their countries. However, the candidates for their successors have all been appointed separately by the authorities of each school, so the teaching is proceeding as usual. Among the four schools, Shanghai University has the most professors withdrawing. According to the school's president, Fan Zhengkang, nine professors have returned to their countries, the most important of whom are English Professor Mrs. Zhang Burus and Miss Ke Naibo, and Sociology Professor Weilai. Their teaching duties are numerous, and once they leave, the loss is significant. The remaining six are female teachers, all of whom have returned to their countries one after another, but the school bureau has decided to do its best to divide the remaining courses among the Western teachers staying in Shanghai, and to invite several graduates of the school who have returned from studying abroad to fill the vacancies, so they can barely maintain the operation. Starting next semester, they will make further adjustments. As for the withdrawal of teachers from St. John's University, according to the school's Deputy Director of Academic Affairs, Mr. Bu, there are seven in total, such as Mrs. Roberts, assistant teacher in the history department, Mr. Ailai and his wife in the engineering department, and Dr. Chuan Erdun, a professor of medicine, etc. Some have returned to their countries, and some have gone to the interior of China, but all vacancies have also been filled by hiring Chinese and foreign professors in the city. The English Department of the school has the most professors withdrawing, and the remaining female teachers are planning to withdraw in February next year, but the school has hired many substitute teachers from among the graduates, so there will be no difficulties. The impact on Soochow University and Hangchow University is very small. Soochow has two teachers returning to their countries, namely Mr. Weilian Shi, director of the sociology department, and Mr. Stilrus, an English teacher in the affiliated high school. Hangchow has the fewest, with only Ms. Huili Sheng, an English teacher, resigning and returning to her country.

### The Orphanage Begins to Reorganize Its Affairs; General Manager Pan Hongding Issues a Statement

According to Datong News Agency, since the teachers of the Wuding Road Orphanage went on strike, all sectors have been eagerly hoping for the rectification of the orphanage's affairs. The reorganization committee has now thoroughly reorganized the orphanage and has also sent an accountant to audit the accounts. A reporter from Datong News Agency visited Pan Hongding, the general manager of the orphanage, yesterday. The details are recorded below:

Corruption in the Orphanage's Affairs: Since the orphanage's affairs were criticized, the chairman of the board of directors, Yuan Ludeng, has reorganized the reorganization committee to reorganize the orphanage, and an investigation has been conducted. According to the minutes of the first meeting of the reorganization committee, there are three points that can be used as an excuse for outsiders: 1. The orphanage's expenses have not been signed and approved by the chairman of the board or the general manager. 2. They only sign in every day and do not stay in the office to work, but still receive their salaries. 3. Some even do not sign in, but receive empty salaries.

Thorough Reorganization: The above three points are currently under investigation and deliberation by the reorganization committee. In addition, there are more than 1,700 yuan of outstanding accounts from the staff, which is also an unprecedented bad example in charitable organizations, and the reorganization committee has ordered them to be paid off within one month. In the future, all expenses of more than ten yuan must be approved by the reorganization committee to emphasize public funds. Regarding the musical instruments and happy seals, according to Mr. Pan's explanation, they are all distributed to the orphans in the band, and each person only receives a few yuan. This has also been eliminated by the reorganization committee and cannot be received.

Deficit of the Previous Term: Finally, regarding the deduction of commissions from donations, according to Mr. Pan, this was the situation when Li Ruzhang was the general manager. In the future, only occasionally, if there are fundraisers from outside who give entertainment expenses due to special reasons, the orphanage will give them discretionally, but there are only one or two cases, and the nature of deducting commissions is absolutely different. Mr. Pan then deeply regretted that Li Ruzhang, the former deceased general manager, had a deficit of more than 40,000 yuan in the orphanage's funds, and that there were no books for auditing when he took over.

Lifeline for Orphans: While the orphanage is being sincerely reorganized, the outside world should give it sympathy and care. The orphanage currently houses a total of more than 630 orphans, and requires 13,000 to 14,000 yuan per month for education and upbringing, which relies on continuous donations to sustain its operations. The entire education and economic development cannot be affected by personnel issues. According to sources from Datong News Agency, the second reorganization meeting has been scheduled for the 25th, and there will be concrete decisions on the reform of the orphanage's affairs, which is what the public is most looking forward to.

In the second round of the Western Union First Division Football League, Tung Wah once again defeated the Jewish team yesterday, with a score of 6-2. The score was 4-0 in the first half. Although center forward Dai Linjing did not play yesterday, Tung Wah still controlled the game and handled it with ease. Two thousand five hundred fans were all smiles when they saw this one-sided situation. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Tung Wah Team:

Qin Bigao

Li Ning, Zhuang Youren

Liang Shutang, Shu Shigeng, Han Longhai

Wu Binghao, Li Yichen, Huang Kehou, Fei Chunhua, Jia Youliang

Jewish Team:

Cohen

Laibete, Meyer, S. Lifu

Difei, Jacob, R. Lifu, Sheng Qi, Stein

Invincible and Breaking Through Four Gates

Tung Wah attacks first, but is intercepted midway. Stein from the Jewish team shoots, but Qin Bigaodefends it. After a long stalemate, at the tenth minute, Tung Wah's army breaks through the center. Huang Kehou passes to the right, Fei Chunhua quickly passes to Jia Youliang. A-Jia hooks the ball to the center, Kehou pushes it into the gap, Wu Binghao shoots and hits the crossbar before bouncing in. After that, the attack is still controlled by Tung Wah. The great Wu-Huang-Jia triangle passes the ball wonderfully, penetrating the enemy's defense. Binghao's header is slightly off by half a foot, which is very regrettable. Five minutes later, Li Yichen steps into the center circle and passes it to Binghao. Binghao delivers a long pass, turning into Youliang's feet, avoiding Sharman, and lightly passing to Xiao Fei. Chunhua gently flicks the ball, Tung Wah scores again. Only one minute apart, Li Yichen and Fei Chunhua weave wonderful passes, deceiving Meyer, and charging straight in on a single horse. The left foot rises and there is a loud bang, entering the ball, Tung Wah scores three goals in a row, and the attack is unprecedentedly strong. Only in the thirty-seventh minute did they encounter a danger. Zhuang Youren caused a major disaster, but fortunately it was just a few inches outside the penalty line, otherwise the penalty kick would have been difficult to avoid. One minute later, Xiao Fei was injured, but fortunately it was not serious. In the forty-second minute, the Jewish army made a mixed attack. Jacob had a good chance to score, but he missed it. One minute before the lemon, Han Longhai kicked a free kick from 30 yards, high in the center, and rebounded from the goal post. Wu Binghao and Li Yichen rushed in, letting the ball into the net. In the first half, Tung Wah won all four goals.

Tung Wah Wins with a Score of Six to Two

Changing sides to fight again, the Jewish army burns their boats and attacks sharply. Four minutes later, Luo Shengqi charges in and Stein shoots hard in front of the goal. Li Ning fails to intercept, and Bigaoprevents is not possible. So, the Jewish team breaks the duck egg. Wu Binghao once again got the assistance of Kehou to shoot, flying half a foot above the crossbar. The Jewish team launched another fierce attack, and Tung Wah was in frequent danger. Fifteen minutes later, Jacob charged in alone. Han Longhai was not prepared, Shu Shigeng let him go lightly, and Zhuang Youren also did the same, so Jacob hit the net with a close-range shot. The Jewish team pulled back the second goal. Twenty-two minutes later, Youliang passed to Binghao, making a left-right pass, and then passed to A-Li, sending the ball to the center. Huang Kehou made a great contribution, making it five to three. Thirty-eight minutes, Li Yichen was about to shoot in the penalty area, but Sharman accidentally committed a foul, and Han Longhai scored the penalty kick, Tung Wah eventually won with a score of six to two.

### Our Country's Wartime Economic Administrative Organs

— Andage

The soundness of economic administration, like that of general administration, depends on both the system and the personnel who implement it, and there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between the two. The structure of the system should be meticulous and concise, with power flowing through it. Those who are in charge should strictly abide by the rules and fulfill their responsibilities to fully exert its effectiveness. If those who manage affairs are upright and sincere, and are dedicated to public service and law-abiding, then any inadequacies in the system can be corrected at any time. Therefore, human resources are truly important. This is why the National Government has convened personnel meetings. However, if the organization is not tight, personnel adjustments will inevitably be difficult. A rational organizational structure can also cultivate talent, eliminate the inferior, and nurture the superior. This is why we need to review our country's wartime economic administrative organs.

Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, China's wartime economic administrative organs have undergone many reforms in response to practical needs. Today, due to the unlimited expansion of the undertakings of various ministries and commissions, new agencies are springing up everywhere. Therefore, adjustment is particularly urgent. The way to adjust is still to emphasize the three major principles that have been vigorously pursued since the beginning of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. That is:

First, the centralization of power; this is necessary in wartime, and it is necessary for overall planning. Without this, it would be insufficient to increase effectiveness and agility in action to adapt to the wartime environment.

Second, the separation of undertakings and government affairs; this is the result that must be hoped for after the development of construction undertakings. Otherwise, it would be insufficient to enable the undertakings that have initially laid the foundation to obtain full development.

Third, a proactive administrative attitude, no longer confined to a guiding role in economic operations, but actively participating in planning, operations, and striving for proactive systems.

Economic administration is more complex than any other administration. During the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, it is of particularly great importance. Due to the development of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction and the expansion of needs, China's economic administrative organs have undergone great changes and are still constantly changing. Below, we will first describe the general situation of the National Government's wartime organization to clarify the importance of the position of economic administration. Then, we will observe the organization of various organs related to economic administration, and then analyze the composition and division of the administrative system according to various departments.

Overall Picture of the Wartime Organization of the National Government

According to Article 8 of the Organic Law of the National Government, the National Government independently exercises the powers of governance through the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans. The National Government establishes a Chairman and twenty-four to thirty-six members to form the National Government Committee. The National Government Committee is established to resolve matters that the Yuans cannot resolve. Therefore, the five Yuans have ninety percent of their own power over their own responsibilities. The National Government is not established above the five Yuans.

According to the provisions of Article 8 of the Organic Law of the National Government, the five Yuans of the National Government have the power to independently exercise the functions of governance. These five Yuans are the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans. Within the Executive Yuan, there are organs in charge of economic affairs. Before the war, there were the four ministries of Finance, Industry, Railways, and Communications. Within the Legislative Yuan, there are specialized committees on finance and economy. Within the Control Yuan, there is the Audit Department, which performs the responsibility of auditing the national financial revenue and expenditure accounting. In addition to the five Yuans, there is also the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics directly under the National Government. The Directorate-General has two bureaus, the Bureau of Accounting and the Bureau of Budget, which are institutions for implementing the transcendent budgetary system. In addition, there is the National Economic Council, which is in charge of

Since the outbreak of the incident, in order to promote the spirit of national resistance and to establish a foundation for constitutional government, a National Political Council has been established in addition to the Central Political Committee. The former maintains the party-state system, while the latter uses the National Political Council to adjust party governance and lay the foundation for the initial stage of constitutional government. Therefore, today's economic administrative facilities, like others, are more democratic than before.

The five Yuans of the National Government originally exercised independent powers of governance. There is no comprehensive organization above them. The only one is the National Government Committee, whose powers are limited to resolving matters that cannot be resolved between the Yuans. After the outbreak of the war, in order to adapt to the needs of the extraordinary period, the Supreme National Defense Council was organized in addition to the National Government Committee. Although it and the National Government Committee both belong to the national policy conference that decides major policies, it is not an executive organ. All major national policies and guidelines decided are handed over to the five Yuans and the organs directly under the National Government for execution. However, the power of the Supreme National Defense Council is in fact greater than that of the National Government Committee. The latter is passively submitted for deliberation when problems that cannot be resolved arise between the Yuans. The former can actively decide matters according to the needs of national defense and military affairs and hand them over to the Yuans and committees for execution. Therefore, all administrative facilities today have been imbued with national defense significance. Economic administrative facilities are naturally no exception.

These are the two major fundamental changes in the wartime organization of the National Government. As for the specialized organs related to economic administration, there have also been major changes. One is that the Ministry of Railways was merged into the Ministry of Communications, and the highway undertakings of the National Economic Council were also merged into the Ministry of Communications. In addition, the water conservancy undertakings under its jurisdiction were merged into the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Therefore, the Council and the Construction Commission have been abolished. All undertakings under the jurisdiction of the Construction Commission have been merged into the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Ministry of Economic Affairs was reorganized and expanded from the former Ministry of Industry. Today, because the various undertakings operated by the Ministry have developed rapidly, and at the same time, the Ministry takes overall responsibility for the overall economic construction, it is inevitable that the feeling of being too big to fail will arise when various undertakings develop fully. Therefore, agricultural and forestry undertakings have now been changed to be handled by the newly established Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The labor sector is specially handled by the Ministry of Social Affairs. Regarding the production, sales, and adjustment of important raw materials and resources, a Ministry of Materials Control is being planned to be established to take full responsibility. Therefore, today's economic administrative organs within the Executive Yuan are: (1) the Ministry of Finance, (2) the Ministry of Economic Affairs, (3) the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, (4) the Ministry of Social Affairs, (5) the Ministry of Communications, and the original National Relief Commission and the newly established National Food Administration, as well as the Central Planning Bureau and the Ministry of Materials Control directly under the National Government (Author's note: Is the National Food Administration an organ directly under the Executive Yuan? Is the Central Planning Bureau an organ directly under the National Government? There seems to be some doubt. The author could not investigate for a while, so he temporarily made this distinction based on its nature and powers. This should be stated first.) Therefore, today's wartime organization of the National Government is as shown in Table 1:

Separate Systems for Financial and Monetary Undertakings

The greatest feature of China's financial administrative organization is that it has always been divided into three departments: budget, accounting, and audit, and financial administration, which are handled separately. The budget, final accounts, and accounting are managed by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, which is directly under the National Government. The audit belongs to the Audit Department of the Control Yuan. The actual financial administration is handled by the Ministry of Finance. The appointment and removal of personnel in charge of budget, accounting, audit, and financial administration are the responsibility of their respective heads. Thus, the so-called united organization is formed. In other words, the three departments of transcendent budget, independent audit, and financial administration, under the division of labor and cooperation, handle national financial matters.

The organization of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Audit Department is very simple, but the Ministry of Finance has formed a huge organization, and it is clearly expanding today in wartime. The reason is that the monetary system and finance are closely related to finance. Therefore, it has always been under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. Since the outbreak of the incident, the facilities on the monetary system and finance have been extremely important. Due to environmental needs, exchange control, trade control, and other policies have been implemented one after another. The purpose of managing trade is to balance international receipts and expenditures and adjust the supply and demand of exchange rates. Therefore, it is also in the Ministry of Finance's responsibility to handle it. This seems to be extremely complicated in the form of administrative organization. Therefore, theorists often advocate transferring powers to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for handling. However, due to various reasons, the status quo is still maintained.

Since the Ministry of Finance also manages financial administration, the system of each financial institution is also under the Minister of Finance. Due to the complicated nature of wartime financial construction, it is extremely difficult to plan and control it without a specialized institution to handle it centrally. Therefore, the heads of the four banks of the Bank of China, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China have jointly established the Joint Office of the Four Banks. Although it belongs to the financial administrative organs of the Ministry of Finance, it is relatively independent and seems to form another financial system.

Speaking of today's financial system, its relationship is unparalleled in complexity. Taking agricultural finance as an example, there is the system of special banks of the United General Office, the system of local banks, the system of commercial banks, the system of the Agricultural Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the financial system of various cooperative undertakings. Therefore, theorists believe that since the United General Office has now established an agricultural finance department, all facilities related to agricultural finance should be under the system of the department. However, because the current system and facilities are already extremely complex, and the department is still in its initial stage, it may not be able to assume this great responsibility suddenly. Therefore, there is no uniform method implemented. However, in the future, there will eventually be a need for practical adjustments and unification, which seems to be beyond doubt.

The internal organization of the Ministry of Finance has been amended seven times since its establishment in the 16th year of the Republic of China. The amended laws were promulgated again in March of the 29th year, which is the eighth amendment. There are two main points of this amendment: one is that the National Treasury is promoted from a department to an administration. This is a reform that should be made after the implementation of the Public Treasury Law, mainly to make the National Treasury the chief of the public treasury system; the second is that a direct tax department is specifically established to handle direct taxes. This is a positive facility for establishing a direct tax system. Therefore, today's financial and monetary administrative system by undertaking has become a huge organization as shown in Table 2.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs was reorganized from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the water conservancy, industrial and mining, and other undertakings under the jurisdiction of the National Economic Council and the Construction Commission were merged into the Ministry and expanded. After the amendment of its Organic Law in July of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the organs related to economic construction that originally belonged to the War Affairs Commission and other ministries and commissions, such as the National Resources Commission, were merged under the Ministry of Economic Affairs. From then on, the scale of the Ministry of Economic Affairs expanded even more. It took charge of all economic administrative and business facilities in agriculture, industry, mining, commerce, forestry, fishery, water conservancy, cooperation, etc. The number of its subordinate organs was once said to be more than one hundred. It stood shoulder to shoulder with the Ministries of Finance and Communications, becoming one of the three major economic hubs in the country. The complexity of the organization and the scale of the undertaking were even greater than those of the Ministry of Finance.

If the organization is too large and the undertaking is too complicated, administrative efficiency will inevitably be somewhat slack. Moreover, the construction undertakings in various aspects it operates have laid the foundation: in order to seek full development in the future, it should be given the convenience of independent progress. Therefore, agricultural and forestry undertakings are now separately established as the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to take charge of their duties. The Ministry of Social Affairs was subsequently established to take charge of labor and general construction on the social level. After the decision of the Supreme National Defense Council, the National Food Administration was established separately to handle the adjustment of food matters. The Ministry of Raw Material Resources Control and Supervision (referred to as the Ministry of Materials Control) is being planned to be established, and it is proposed to bring all existing organs related to the production and sales of raw material resources under the jurisdiction of the Ministry. Then, the Ministry of Economic Affairs can concentrate its energy on the development of inland industry and commerce in the future.

Generally speaking, the current administrative organizational system for economic construction undertakings will be as follows:

Industrial and commercial undertakings - the Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for handling

Agricultural and forestry reclamation undertakings - the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is responsible for handling

Social welfare and cooperative undertakings - the Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible for handling

Supply and demand adjustment of mineral products and important materials - the Ministry of Materials Control is responsible for handling

Water conservancy undertakings - the Water Conservancy Commission (currently under the Ministry of Economic Affairs)

However, in terms of the current situation, the various business administrative organizational systems under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Social Affairs are as shown in Tables 3 and 4.

Before the war, China's transportation administrative organizational system was extremely scattered and complicated. The Ministry of Communications was in charge of navigation administration, telecommunications administration, postal administration, etc. Railways were handled by the Ministry of Railways. Highways were handled by the National Economic Council. The local construction bureaus of each province and even the local construction bureaus of each county also had their own local transportation administrative organs. Although the administrative facilities and construction plans at all levels were not completely unrelated, the drawbacks of each doing their own thing were often seen.

After the outbreak of the war, the Military Affairs Commission, in order to implement wartime control of domestic transportation, immediately hired technical experts and formed the Local Service Department within the Commission. A Transportation Command was established under it to manage and dispatch military transportation matters. It had broad and powerful powers to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation with the original Ministries of Railways and Communications. Although military transportation has been unified, the system of civilian transportation and freight transportation, as well as the promotion of new plans, has not yet achieved the realm of overall planning. Therefore, from January of the 28th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Railways and the National Economic Council were abolished, and the duties of railways and highways were merged into the Ministry of Communications. From then on, transportation undertakings such as railways, highways, water transportation, communications, and aviation were centrally managed, and the unification of control power was completed. As shown in Table 5.

### Financial Review

— Sheng Kaiqiong

——As of December 21st——

After the Establishment of the "Bank of China" in Nanjing

Since the end of last year, there has been the so-called establishment of the "Central Bank" in Nanjing. In mid-November of this year, after Japan's peace offensive in China failed, following the recognition of Nanjing and the exchange of conditions for the signing of "Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation," with the permission of the Japanese side, as a means to "thoroughly adjust finance and lay the economic foundation," the Nanjing "Central Reserve Bank" Law was announced on December 19th, and on the same day, the "Regulations of the Foreign Exchange Fund Management Committee" were also announced, as well as the so-called "Interim Measures for整理Currency" which will be implemented from January 6th of next year. Ordinary people, without examining the truth, only see the superficial appearance, and another opportunity for speculation has arrived. The Shanghai market in the afternoon of the 21st actually set off a storm again.

If you think carefully, then there is no need to be surprised. You must know that the legal currency of a country must have two main conditions, that is, it must be exercised in any behavior and exercised in any region. In other words, since it is a legal currency, there should be no restrictions on acceptance. Now, does the banknotes that the "Central Bank" of Nanjing wants to issue have any restrictions on acceptance like the Chinese legal tender? Although the "Measures for exercising it in any behavior and region" stipulate that "all people pay grain taxes and other... payments shall be exercised uniformly," but looking at its statement, it has already said that "the circulation area of the United Reserve Bank Notes in North China will temporarily maintain the status quo, and Japanese military currency will fully cooperate with the "Nanjing currency" in Central China to complete their respective missions." This is clearly limited in terms of regional exercise, and its restrictions are also very clear in terms of behavioral exercise. Now Japan regards military currency as the only currency exercised in the trade of the occupied areas and the methods of plundering, as well as the income of transportation and public utilities. Then, the so-called "all taxes, remittances, and all public and private transactions shall be exercised uniformly," etc., I don't know what exactly it is. Is it that all the transactions where Japanese military currency is exercised will first use the "Nanjing currency" to exchange for legal tender, and then exchange for military currency, forming a triangular relationship for exercise!

Furthermore, under the currency management system, the issuance of banknotes must have foreign exchange funds for payment to maintain its value, although it is not redeemable internally. The Japanese, who are as profound as they are, although they supply military finance with "United Reserve Bank Notes" in North China and "military currency" in Central China, they must take the export of domestic materials as a prerequisite in order to maintain the value of "United Reserve Bank Notes" and "military currency." It can be seen that the fund reserve is an essential requirement for issuing banknotes. Now Nanjing claims that the fund reserve is ready and the "Foreign Exchange Fund Management Committee" has been established, but where is its base? Borrowing from Japan? Japan itself has no way to finance it. It is even more out of the question to borrow from other foreign countries. Then will Japanese military currency be used as a reserve? Look at the measures for issuing banknotes in Nanjing published by the Japanese Allied Press on July 2: (1) "Nanjing currency" is exchanged for legal tender at par; (2) The exchange rate to military currency is determined according to legal tender; (3) Military currency is used as the issuance reserve. The first point has been confirmed. The second point comes from the first point, so of course there is no problem. Then, the third point is to use Japanese military currency as the fund reserve for the "Nanjing currency," and combined with the statement "to fully cooperate with each other so that each can complete its respective missions," it seems that there is no doubt about it. However, military currency has already been used as much as possible to maintain and support the export of materials from Japan itself. Now it is used as a reserve for the "Nanjing currency," which will not further expand the赘瘤of Japanese finance? Adding to the burden of Japanese finance, the calculated Japanese will never want the preparation of "Nanjing currency" to come from this method.

In this way, some people think that legal tender will be greatly affected in the occupied areas. However, using the past to prove the future, it is not difficult to know the truth. For example, the "United Reserve Bank Notes" in North China, under the personal planning of the Japanese army, first limited the time for exchanging legal tender, then limited the area of exercise, and further prohibited exercise. However, the result was still unable to reduce the circulation of legal tender, and instead canceled all restrictions on the prohibition of legal tender. In Central China, the Weixin organization promoted "Huaxing notes," and also first set a ratio for legal tender to circulate, and then limited the time for exchange. As a result, all the legal tender circulating in the occupied market is still legal tender. Legal tender has been hit and squeezed by military currency in North China and Central China. The value maintained by the currency that is hit and squeezed is parasitic on the life of legal tender, and it remains unmoved throughout. Then, the future Chinese legal tender, supported by the United Kingdom and the United States, will become more firm and expensive.

Gold Ornaments Raised by Ten Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in gold and silver shops, Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang both raised by another ten yuan, reaching 640 yuan (the purchase price is reduced by more than 30 yuan). As for cash futures, encountering the weekly holiday, although no transactions have been heard outside the market, the price has slightly returned to 6,240 yuan.

Red and White Sugar Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was still tight, and continued to see increases. The Association's clearing price for spot goods was 24 coarse white foreign warehouse goods at 78 yuan 5 jiao to 8 jiao, up 1 yuan 3 jiao. The spot price of Dutch red was initially 62 yuan 8 jiao to 63 yuan, and then rose to 63 yuan 2 jiao, up 7 jiao before and after. The warehouse list for the end of this month was 63 yuan to 63 yuan and a half. Taikoo car white also rose 5 jiao to 3 jiao. B mark was 77 yuan to 77 yuan and a half. DY mark was 74 yuan to 74 yuan and a half. HX mark was 74 yuan to 74 yuan 3 jiao. National sugar was also slightly active and the asking price rose by 1 yuan, but no transactions were made.

Xinghua Longans Rebounded After Extreme Fatigue

Since Xinghua dried longans fell, the decline has been too severe, and there is a tendency to be unable to protect the capital. Therefore, some customers and goods are unwilling to unload with the market, and in addition, a certain ship was detained on the way, and the market outlook slightly improved. Yesterday the market has rebounded by 120 yuan.

Cigarette Black Market Soars

The cigarette market is soaring in the black market. Affected by foreign exchange, people are panicked. Stockpilers are searching the market, and supply does not meet demand, causing prices to rise sharply. Yesterday, the market opened at 920 yuan for old knives, and then money industry gangs actively purchased them, opening for sale at 930 yuan, which was still tight. Great Britain rose from 1,320 yuan to 1,330 yuan. Wuhua brand was 660 yuan. Little Fairy brand was 660 yuan. Pinhai brand was 8556 yuan. Huacheng Little Beauty brand was 910 yuan. The manufacturer of Golden Rat brand notified of an increase in the market price, and the new price was 900 yuan.

Spot Yuan Rose Again Without Underlying Support

The daily rise in spot silver dollars is terrifying. In addition to the fact that there are indeed transactions in this street, the tightening of foreign exchange should be the main reason for its surge. It was found that yesterday's market price for spot silver dollars had broken through the 70 yuan mark, and spot ingots also required 645 yuan, both of which rose by a huge 45 yuan compared to before.

Cloves Arrived Yesterday

The price of cloves rose by dozens of yuan before due to supply shortages. Yesterday, it was learned that a batch of goods from the store had recently arrived in Shanghai. Given the tight exchange rate, the cost is higher than before, and the asking price has risen accordingly. A deal is expected to be made in the near future.

### The Legal Tender has a Fixed Value, Trusted by Both Chinese and Foreigners; China, Britain, and America Cooperatively Control the Black Market Exchange Rate; The Legal Tender's Cash Reserve is Increasingly Sufficient; The Ministry of Economic Affairs Issues an Order to Strengthen the Economic Blockade and Seize Materials

The Times reports that rumors circulate that Nanjing is organizing a new "bank" soon, causing concerns that it will undermine the Central Bank at 439 Avenue Edward VII and the positions of its 600 employees. However, according to well-informed Chinese sources, such disruption will not succeed. It is pointed out that although the "United Reserve Bank" was established two years ago, the banks established by the National Government in the foreign concessions of Tianjin continued to operate, and the legal tender also continued to circulate as usual in other occupied areas. All cash of the bank has now been transported to a certain location for safekeeping, and China's legal legal tender, supported by foreign currency, has a fixed value and will not be affected by unapproved banknotes.

Cash Reserve

Since the National Government announced the outline of measures to consolidate finance, replenish the legal tender reserve and control the issuance of legal tender, the legal tender reserve, in addition to the original gold and silver and foreign exchange, has also added short-term commercial paper, warehouse receipts for goods and investments in production enterprises. The Issuance Reserve Management Committee has invited representatives from chambers of commerce and banking guilds from various regions to participate in public inspections, and the amount of issuance and the actual situation of the reserve have been announced. Today, the issuance of legal tender is still below the saturation point, and the cash reserve is in line with the statutory amount. Therefore, Chinese and foreigners in the occupied areas, although under pressure, cherish the legal tender and recognize it as China's only currency.

The Official Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged

Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee fully determined the official foreign exchange rate, the official foreign exchange price of the Central Bank has remained the same. The legitimate needs of all industries can be handled and approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee. As for the exchange rates in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the government previously tried to maintain them, but after the Japanese seized the foreign exchange fund, the listing address of the foreign exchange prices of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications was moved from Hong Kong to Chongqing, the seat of the government, and gradually detached from the constraints of the black market in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Now that the foreign exchange fund has been replenished by huge loans from friendly countries, it is sufficient to stabilize the official exchange rate for a long time. As for the black market exchange rate in Shanghai, it is still handled secretly in cooperation with British and American banks to prevent irregularities.

Gold Production Increases Sevenfold

Since the establishment of the Gold Mine Administration by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, by the end of this year, the gold production will be 350,000 ounces, which is more than seven times the pre-war production. Calculated at the current official price of 560 yuan per tael, China's treasury revenue has increased by another 200 million yuan. 95% of the total output is obtained by panning. Two major mineral deposits were discovered this year, one in Huitong County in western Hunan, near Guiyang, and the other in Jiangjin, near Chongqing. Huitong has 100,000 taels of gold, and Jiangjin contains at least 50,000 taels in the sand. It is also heard that the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications have agreed to lend 3 million yuan annually to the bureau to lend to various commercial gold companies. In the future, China's gold production will develop surprisingly, which is really beneficial to the war of resistance and reconstruction.

Economic Scorched Earth Policy

The Ministry of Economic Affairs issued an order to the provincial and municipal governments, the headquarters of the commanders of the war zones, the economic committees of the war zones, and the chambers of commerce in various regions to pay attention to determining economic barriers, strengthening economic blockade, and promptly trying to seize materials from various places, and actively developing the strength of economic guerrillas. It is designated that state-owned institutions purchase materials. It is reported that the purchasing institutions are the Resources Committee, the Trade Committee, the Agricultural Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the China Tea Company, the Fuhua Company, and the Fuxing Company.

### More Than One Hundred American Missionaries and Others Leave Shanghai by the Coolidge

The U.S. Mail Steamship Company's 13,000-ton giant ship, President Coolidge, is scheduled to arrive here at the end of this month via Manila and Hong Kong, carrying a large number of mails and many passengers transferring to the United States, and will dock at pontoons 11 and 12. Passengers will be carried by the Jianghai Customs passenger ferry to the new customs wharf for landing at about 10:00 in the morning. The ship will stay here overnight and is scheduled to leave port on January 1 next year, and return to San Francisco and Los Angeles via Kobe, Yokohama, and Honolulu. More than 40 missionaries, women and children from the Presbyterian Church of Shanghai and Nanjing districts, and more than 100 other less important personnel from various churches, will return to their country on the ship at that time. The situation of ordinary American expatriates and missionaries in Shanghai is different. They have not yet prepared to return to their country and will generally spend the New Year holidays here, and decide whether to stay or leave depending on the evolution of the situation. It is generally believed that March next year will be an important decisive juncture.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Sells off the Eastern District Vegetable Market

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is currently in financial straits. The income from income tax is always insufficient to cover expenditures, and there is no great need for some properties in the Eastern District for a while. It has already sold off many batches. According to sources from the Pingming News Agency, since the Eastern District has been controlled by the Japanese army, the business of the Yangshupu Vegetable Market and the Qiqihar Road Vegetable Market has been very sluggish, which has caused the Municipal Council to bear expenditures. Therefore, on the recommendation of the Special Economic Committee of the Municipal Council, it is planned to sell the two vegetable markets at an appropriate time. Among them, the Qiqihar Road Vegetable Market may be sold at a good price, because the vegetable market only needs to be slightly renovated to be converted into a useful storage yard.

### Merchant You Molin Was Moved to West Shanghai by the Japanese; The Police Originally Refused to Transfer Him Due to Lack of Evidence; It is Unknown How They Agreed to the Japanese Taking Him Away Again

Wan Molin, the owner of Wanchang Rice Store at No. 94 Kai Zi Er Road, west of the Eight Immortals Bridge, was invited to a banquet by a friend at the Jinmen Hotel in Pao Shou Hall, Jing'an Temple Road at about 8:00 p.m. the night before. It is not known how, when he arrived in front of the hotel, he was suddenly arrested by the Japanese military police together with the Central Police and taken to the Central Police Station. At that time, they also rushed to his residence to search, paying attention to all his documents, but no objects related to criminal evidence were copied out. It is generally believed that Wan is a formal merchant and a Chinese committee member of the French Municipal Council, and it has never been heard that he is involved in politics. This arrest is really puzzling. It is heard that after Wan was arrested, he was detained at the Central Police Station of the Public Concession. The Japanese requested extradition. The police initially refused in order to protect the safety of formal merchants because Wan had no criminal evidence. Later, it is unknown how, at about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the police actually complied with the Japanese request and actually allowed the Japanese to take Wan to West Shanghai. Wan is from Pudong, 51 years old, but he was once listed as one of the "wanted". When Wan was taken away the night before, three other young people, Lu Lu and others, were also arrested at the same time.

### Bloodshed at the Jinshan Hotel Last Night; Chen Guangyan Assassinated; Shot in a Vital Spot and Died on the Spot; Severely Wounded by Stray Bullet While Leaving the Store

A traveler in Room 531, fifth floor, of the Jinshan Hotel, Guangxi Road, Hankou Road, was shot and killed last night at 7:45. The deceased was Chen Guangyan, the current chief of the Special Affairs Section of the "Municipal Police Bureau." He was shot in the head and died on the spot. The murderer fired a total of three shots and escaped without a trace by the spiral staircase afterward. A shop patron was injured by a stray bullet, leaving him in critical condition. The details are recorded as follows:

Resting at the Jinshan Hotel

Chen Guangyan, 40 years old, from Hangzhou, was formerly the captain of the seventh squadron of the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After the war, he defected and served as the chief of the Special Affairs Section of the "Municipal Police Bureau." Recently, the "Municipal Government" sent many police officers to Japan, and Chen also participated in it. On the 10th of this month, Chen went to the Jinshan Hotel, No. 678, Guangxi Road, Hankou Road, and opened Room 530 on the fifth floor. He did not move to the small room next door, No. 531, until the 18th. The daily room fee was 5 yuan and a few cents. Chen must visit the hotel every evening at sunset. It has become a habit in the past ten days.

Shot in the Head and Died on the Spot

At exactly 7:00 last night, Chen first went to the Dadong Ballroom to wander around and sit for a while, with the dancer Ye Baobao (from Suzhou, over 20 years old) tied to him. Before long, he took Baobao out for dinner. With arms linked, they went to Room No. 531 in the Jinshan Hotel. As soon as they sat down, two murderers lurked in the corridor. Seeing that Chen had entered, they tracked him in. One guarded the door and the other pushed open the door without asking the reason. They pulled out their pistols and fired three shots at him. One shot hit his head and he fell to the ground and died. Chen's body was in front of the bed.

Dancer Frightened and Injured While Leaving the Store

At this time, the dancer Baobao saw that the client had been shot and killed, and was as frightened as a wooden chicken. She was so frightened that she could not speak, and she was lucky enough not to be hit by a stray bullet. She was very lucky. When the bullets were flying, Hu Yaochun (31 years old, from Yuyao), who was about to leave the store, had just signed in at the manager's office on the sixth floor and was going downstairs to take over the shift. When passing through the doorway, a stray bullet hit his face and penetrated his forehead, but did not go through. Blood was pouring out and the injury was very serious. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the murderer escaped without a trace by the spiral staircase with his weapon.

Detectives Investigated and Found Cartridge Cases

After the incident, the account room telegraphed the Old Gate Police Station and ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush there. However, the murderer had already fled far away. After investigating the room where the incident occurred, they found several cartridge cases and took them back to the police station for research. The dancer Ye Baobao was also taken to the police station for questioning. At the same time, an ambulance was quickly called and Chen's body and the injured Hu Yaochun were sent to Renji Hospital. It is reported that Hu's injury is serious and his life is also in danger. When reporters heard the news and went to investigate the room, they saw blood stains all over the floor and could not bear to look at it. Chen's family and relatives had heard the news and arrived at the scene, all with sad faces.

### Houses in Wangjia Lane Continue to be Demolished; More Than 200 People Have Nowhere to Move; They Will Be Forcibly Evicted by the Japanese

Since the Japanese announced the demolition of Wangjia Lane, Daxi Road, West Shanghai, and its conversion into "Sasaki Road," the demolition continued yesterday. Most of the houses there have been destroyed, but more than 200 residents who have nowhere to live remain at the bottom of the lane. However, they have received a notice that they must completely move out before the 25th of this month. The general situation in West Shanghai yesterday remained the same. The barbed wire at the intersection of Daxi Road and Jing'an Temple Road has not been removed, and the main entrances of the roads leading to Caojiadu are also in a semi-blocked state. A gap at the intersection of Avenue Road and Jessfield Road has been expanded, but the British-owned Route 7 bus has not yet restored its original route. The Route 14 bus still has Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road as its terminus. Also, after Dingpan Road, Zhuanbang Road, and Yongyuanbang Road were opened on the 20th, the opening hours were extended to 8:00 p.m. yesterday, but the hired police there strictly prohibited residents from carrying items out.

### Labor-Management Negotiations in the Used Clothing Industry; A Satisfactory Resolution; Both Parties Abide by the Six Conditions

All the employees in the used clothing industry in this city once went on strike because they requested the authorities to improve their treatment. Later, after the relevant parties tried their best to mediate, and both labor and management were able to take the overall situation into consideration and discuss sincerely, business was restored and the dispute was completely resolved. It is heard that the labor and management representatives agreed on six conditions that both parties will strictly abide by: (1) The commission used to be 2.5% per yuan, but now it is increased to 3%. If the new goods have already been distributed, they will still be distributed as before. Those who were not previously included in the distribution shall not be added to the distribution. If it is less than 2.5%, it will be supplemented to the signed date from December 1. (2) The original salary of 4 yuan will be increased by a subsidy of 6 yuan from the date of signing. Those who have already exceeded 6 yuan shall not be reduced. The monthly fee of 6 jiao will be changed to 1 yuan. (3) 5 fen for spreading clothes, cloth clothes and short pieces, 1 jiao for silk clothes and long pieces, 8 fen for silk short pieces, 2 jiao for leather short pieces, 3 jiao for leather long pieces, and 2 jiao for coats regardless of new or old, male or female, and leather collar. (4) Each store shall not dismiss employees without fault. (5) From the date of signing, employees who have served for more than one year shall be given a severance payment of one month by the store when they are dismissed, calculated based on the average of the last six months' salary commission at the time of dismissal. However, those who are dismissed for special faults and those who resign on their own are not included in this rule. (6) The above conditions shall take effect from the date of signing.

### White Russian Immigrants in this City Purchase Cheap Coal; The Jewish Association Levies Income Tax

According to the announcement of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, after the White Russian Immigrant Committee in this city met with several Tianjin coal merchants, all White Russian immigrants were able to purchase coal at a price of 80 yuan to 100 yuan per ton for winter use. The current market price of coal is 240 yuan per ton, which is 140 yuan more than the agreed price. White Russians in this city have benefited greatly. Also, the White Russian Immigrant Committee yesterday received a proposal from the Jewish Association stating that it will levy a "voluntary income tax" on White Russians of Jewish descent in this city. This plan has been approved. After implementation, 40% of the income will be allocated to the White Russian Immigrant Committee, and the remaining 60% will be retained for the use of the Jewish Association. There are more than 14,000 Jewish refugees in this city. This income will be used as a relief fund.

### The Obstacles on North Xizang Road Are Still Closed at Midnight

The barbed wire frame erected by the former British defense forces stationed in Shanghai on North Xizang Road has been opened by the Japanese in violation of the agreement. According to a reporter from the Daguang News Agency who visited the site yesterday, a barbed wire frame was set up at the entrance of the "New Central Market" in the north of Nicheng Bridge. The police department sent detectives to guard it when it was opened during the day. It was closed every day from 12:00 midnight. Recently, the Japanese have been using the excuse that they urgently need to transport goods at night, and the agreement previously reached by the two parties has been broken. Japanese trucks carrying vegetables pass through frequently in the middle of the night. After negotiations by the authorities, it has been closed from 12:00 midnight as usual, cutting off traffic.

### Ford Company Repair Cars Go to the Rear Service

The American Ford Motor Company has newly established a repair engineering service patrol car to facilitate the driving of vehicles in the Chinese interior. They set off from Beiping and Shanghai to Nanning and Chengdu, passing through various parts of China, so that Chinese wartime rear highway vehicles can be repaired.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Has No Right to Levy Land Tax on Fangdan Land; The Council Threatens to Stop Supplying Electricity; The Property Owners Have Filed a Complaint with the Consular Court; The Court Has Issued a Judgment Citing the Land Regulations

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession does not levy land tax on land within the concession that belongs to land certificates and Fangdan, except for those who have special circumstances and have contracts with the council. Therefore, in addition to paying the national tax, the relationship between the landlord and the Shanghai Municipal Council is only that the tenants pay the house tax on the buildings on the land. However, since 1931, the council has repeatedly levied land tax. The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession has repeatedly protested based on the complaints of taxpayers, but it has still failed to stop it. Recently, landlords Fang Jiahe, Hu Jingfang, Zhu Ruiqing, Fang Wende, etc. were notified by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the telephone company to stop supplying electricity because they legally refused to pay the Fangdan land tax. Now, Fang and others have hired lawyers to file a complaint with the Consular Court. At the same time, they have presented a request to the Chinese Taxpayers Association's electric power department to seriously negotiate with the embassies of the countries concerned. The electricity presentation is attached with the judgment of the First Special District Local Court Yi Zi No. 2115 on the reasons why Fangdan land tax does not need to be paid.

### Reasons for the Judgment of the First Special Court

"The question of whether the plaintiff, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, has the right to levy land tax on the defendant, and whether the defendant has the obligation to pay land tax to the plaintiff, should be based on the phrase "land within the concession" in Section 9 of the Shanghai Public Concession Land Regulations. It includes both Daodi land and Fangdan land. The land in the Shanghai Public Concession can be roughly divided into two types: Daodi land and Fangdan land (including those with land holding certificates). Daodi land refers to land whose sovereignty still belongs to China, which foreigners lease from Chinese people in accordance with the treaties concluded between the former Qing Dynasty and foreign countries, and by applying the provisions of Sections 2 to 5 of the Land Regulations. The lease rights of this kind of land now belong to foreigners, some foreigners have transferred them to Chinese people after obtaining them, and some Chinese people have obtained them by borrowing the names of foreign merchants. All of them pay tax to the plaintiff. In addition, there is Fangdan land, all the rights and interests of which belong to Chinese people and are no different from private land of foreigners outside the Public Concession. The plaintiff has never levied tax on Fangdan land. This is undisputed by the plaintiff's agent in the oral argument, but it is defended by saying that it is the plaintiff's tolerance. The Shanghai Public Concession Land Regulations are only a creed for the mutual restraint of foreigners residing in the Public Concession to establish autonomous administrative power (the article on Chinese directors was added later). Looking at the entire text of the regulations, the meaning of land refers to

Daodi, as stipulated in Sections 6 and 16 of the regulations, is very clear. In addition, there are important references. The book *The Report of Mr. F.W. 唐*載载, on page 260 (Chinese version, the same below), line 7, states "Land that is still held by the original Chinese land deeds, although located within the Public Concession, has not been taxed." Page 658, line 11, states "Chinese people own this land (referring to Fangdan land), and according to the Land Regulations, no land tax is collected." Page 661, line 10, states "Chinese landlords holding Chinese land deeds do not need to pay land tax, as mentioned above." Page 681, line 9, states "The Municipal Council cannot deviate from this legal provision and exercise its right of free deliberation" (referring to the right to tax). This report repeatedly discusses the plaintiff's failure to levy land tax on Fangdan land, which can be said to be extremely clear. Tang's report was made because the plaintiff's former chairman hired him to make a report, which was adopted and published by the plaintiff. Tang's report on Fangdan land tax is not his personal private opinion, but a prominent fact that has been known to both Chinese and foreigners in the Public Concession for a long time. He described the situation based on the results of on-site investigations. According to the report, it is sufficient to prove that the land referred to in Section 9 of the Land Regulations does not include Fangdan land. In other words, the plaintiff's levy of Fangdan land tax is not only without factual basis, but also prohibited by the regulations. Furthermore, if it is as the plaintiff claims that the plaintiff has the right to levy tax on Fangdan land, why has it abandoned its rights for nearly a hundred years since the opening of the Public Concession? From a historical perspective, the plaintiff has never had the right to levy land tax on Fangdan land from the beginning. The matter is obvious. As for the plaintiff's claim that the land tax collected exceeds the ratio stipulated in the Land Regulations, it is not discussed here because it is irrelevant to the basic essence of this case. After the end of the oral argument, the plaintiff supplemented the reasons with a written statement, stating that in 1870, there were 128 Fangdan land taxpayers including Cao Yongqing, and listed the names of 11 people including Cao Yongqing. Not only does what he said contradict the statements made in the oral argument and the report of F.W. Tang, but he also failed to provide evidence to prove that the examples he cited are real. Even if it is as he said, it is only an arbitrary act of scholars and cannot change the regulations and bind others. Therefore, there is no need to discuss it in detail. Now, the defendant is unwilling to pay the land tax claimed by the plaintiff, and it is even more difficult to use precedents for comparison. In addition, the plaintiff cannot provide evidence that the organization organized by Chinese taxpayers in the Shanghai Public Concession has notified all Fangdan land owners to pay land tax to the plaintiff in accordance with legal methods. It is sufficient to prove that the defendant's defense that there is no obligation to pay tax on Fangdan land is often legitimate. As for the plaintiff's claim that, according to common sense, all Fangdan land owners in the Public Concession have civic rights and should also have the obligation to pay land tax, etc. From a legal perspective, this argument is nothing more than a suggestion

It can be used as a reference for amending the regulations. However, it is still unfounded to want to use this as a reason to directly seek a judgment from the legal organ that is favorable to the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff has no right to levy land tax on Fangdan land unless it amends the regulations in accordance with legal procedures. Based on the above explanation, the plaintiff's suit cannot be said to be reasonable and should be rejected. The defendant was legally summoned but did not appear at the last oral argument date. The plaintiff's request is approved to make a judgment based on the debate of one party in accordance with Article 385, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Procedure Law. Based on the above conclusion, the plaintiff's suit is unreasonable. The judgment is made in accordance with Article 78 of the Civil Procedure Law as follows:

### Japan Actively Adds New Ships to Advance Shipping to the South

According to foreign news, the Japanese are actively promoting the shipping south advancement plan. This plan is to build several 4,000-ton ships as soon as possible. Once completed, they will be deployed in Shanghai, Shantou, Qingdao, Dalian, Tianjin, etc. It is also planned to expand the route to Haiphong and Bangkok, Thailand, and it is planned to realize its shipping south advancement plan once a month from Xiamen to Bangkok.

### People in the Occupied Areas Struggle to Live a Sad Life Due to the Japanese Stringent Control of Prices; Flying Yarn; Chinese Troops Often Clash with Japanese Troops in the Countryside

Regarding the living conditions of the people in the occupied areas of Jiangnan, due to the Japanese stringent control of materials, the standard of living has been constantly rising, resulting in sighs of being unable to live in peace. According to people from Dangxi who talked about the recent situation there, there are many things to report. The following is a summary:

High Prices; Eating Miscellaneous Grains to Fill the Stomach

Chang and Xi are located in the center of Huning Road and were originally a land of fish and rice. Since the three years after the war, residents who have migrated abroad have gradually returned to their hometowns to maintain their livelihoods, enduring humiliation and breathing in their hometowns. There is no other choice. Since July of this year, the Japanese have implemented strict control over various items. Daily necessities such as cotton yarn, cloth, sugar, salt, kerosene, cigarettes, and matches are prohibited from being imported, resulting in unprecedentedly high prices. For example, the price of sugar is 1 yuan and 2 jiao per city catty, a small box of matches sells for 1 jiao, a pack of British brand cigarettes is 4 jiao and 2 fen, and the price of yarn is also twice as high as in Shanghai. As for food, although it is slightly lower than in Shanghai, the price of rice is also over 70 yuan per stone because the countryside cannot be close to the city. Such high prices have made the middle and lower class residents eat miscellaneous grains every day (such as flour and sweet potatoes). They eat rice for less than ten days a month. As for the villagers, they are in a sad situation because foreign goods are expensive, coupled with a large number of bandits. This year, they have also suffered from famine, and the harvest is at most 70%.

Small Goods Are Confiscated

In order to maintain their livelihoods, general middle and lower class residents tend to Shanghai to販运 small items, such as cigarettes, cloth, matches, etc., to sell back to their hometowns. Most of those engaged in this type of business are women. Generally, they raise 100 or 200 yuan to make a trip to Shanghai and return the next night. Every time, after deducting travel expenses and food and accommodation expenses, they can earn dozens of yuan. Therefore, the general public flocked to it, resulting in extremely crowded passengers on Huning Road. There are dozens or hundreds of people who buy tickets but cannot board the train every day. The hired police at the Shanghai North Station are like wolves and tigers, beating passengers indiscriminately with wooden sticks and shoulder poles, resulting in cries of despair. Several days ago, some people were even trampled to death. This type of small goods贩 sellers has now been seen through by the station, so the confiscation policy is implemented. The items confiscated by the station are piled up like mountains. Those who have scraped together hundreds of yuan to sell goods in Shanghai and have them confiscated are all desperate. Last time, there was a car bombing near Waikuatang, and there were also many peddlers among the victims.

Miscellaneous Taxes and Levies; Willful Extortion

Chinese troops are extremely active in the occupied areas and often clash with Japanese troops. Japanese troops in the northwest of Changzhou are building a highway from Xiaohe to Hengshan Bridge, 50 kilometers long, but the section that is built is destroyed by the Chinese troops and villagers, making it impossible to proceed. The cities and the area along the railway are surrounded by barbed wire, which is electrified at night. When villagers enter the city, they must pay taxes even if they carry a chicken or a pig. Inns and restaurants in the city are more developed because most of the hooligans and bandits in the countryside have been incorporated by the Japanese and live extravagantly. They are self-sufficient in extortion. This deformed market is characterized by smoke and gambling everywhere in the occupied areas. There is no need to go into details.

### Inside Story of the Murder of a Japanese Policeman: Possibly a Love Triangle

Miyazaki Satoshi, a police officer from the Japanese Consulate, was walking out of the "Soldiers' Comfort Station" on Menghua Street in the Nanshi area at 11 PM on the 20th. Unexpectedly, when he reached the intersection of Wenmiao Road and Zhonghua Road, he was violently struck twice in the lower back with an ax by someone. He died of his injuries. According to investigations, after the incident, the Japanese military police searched the residents in the area. A Chinese resident living in an alley off Zhonghua Road was arrested and taken to the Xiejiao Military Police Substation. After questioning, he was released. It is also understood that the Japanese officer often had disputes when frequenting the "Comfort Station." Therefore, his murder may have been due to a love triangle.

### Summary of Important News

More than 300 knitting factory engineers throughout the city went on strike demanding improved treatment and cost of living allowances. The strike has lasted for four days. The factory owners, noting the approach of winter, the heavy demand for goods, and the inability to fulfill contracts with customers and deliver goods on time, and fearing the escalation of the situation and its impact on future business, have had some of the knitting factory representatives specially delegate representatives to negotiate directly with labor representatives at 9 PM last night. Detailed results will be reported later. It is also understood that more than 10,000 male and female workers from the factories have participated in the strike.

The Zhenhai Association in Shanghai received a telegram from the Zhenhai Food Regulation Committee requesting funds to purchase rice and planning to purchase from various locations in Zhejiang and Jiangxi, requiring approximately one million yuan. Shanghai agreed to provide 300,000 yuan as an advance. Yesterday, Chairman Yu Qiaqing and other committee members jointly sent a telegram to Zhenhai, requesting them to send personnel to Zhejiang and Jiangxi to make purchases immediately.

The local British War Relief Fund received over 15,400 yuan in donations last week, bringing the total to 1,546,277.56 yuan. There was no increase in pound sterling donations, which remained at 22,831 pounds. Additionally, the St. Andrew's Society, organized by Scottish expatriates in Shanghai, has recently launched a fundraising campaign.

There were originally 14 sausage factories in the city, producing various kinds of casings that were exported to Europe and the United States, with an annual value of several million yuan. Recently, due to the Japanese control of livestock, the number of cattle, sheep, and pigs transported to Shanghai has been decreasing, and even local residents are finding it difficult to obtain enough to eat. Therefore, the sausage factories that produce casings for export cannot obtain the raw materials. Many have closed down one after another. Currently, only five or six, including Dechang, Shenchang, Luqi, Fuhua, and Dehua, are barely surviving. The casings they produce are insufficient for export and are only used for local consumption.

### High Tide on the Huangpu River on New Year's Day

According to the dredging bureau's prediction, there will be a high tide on the Huangpu River on New Year's Day. The water level will reach 10 feet 2.5 inches. The tide will begin at 3 PM and will recede starting at 5 PM, and will completely recede around 11 PM. The current of the Huangpu River will be particularly strong during the high tide, reaching 1.9 nautical miles per hour.

### Chinese Police in the French Concession Request the Authorities to Accommodate Them. Current Discussions are Focused on Resolving the Issue. The Police are Continuing to Work Normally and Await a Response.

Chinese police in the French Concession submitted eleven revised articles to Chief Inspector Zhou Shangyi on the 19th of this month, requesting a prompt response from the French side in order to safeguard their positions. The articles have now been submitted to the highest authorities in the French Concession. It is reported that the French side, with a view to resolving the issue as soon as possible, will hold meetings in the coming days to discuss and resolve the issue. It is also reported that the French side is sympathetic to the plight of the Chinese police and is likely to abolish the "Public Affairs" requirement (i.e., the requirement to submit fifteen permits per month) as this measure is opposed by the general public. As for the Chinese Police Mutual Aid Association, the French side does not believe it is necessary to organize it, but the Chinese police cite the example of the Public Concession and state that it is purely a welfare organization with no other purpose. A response to all requests will be issued in the shortest possible time. Currently, the Chinese police are continuing to perform their duties normally and are awaiting a response.

### Installation of Automatic Traffic Lights in the French Concession

In order to improve the appearance of the city and save the need to deploy traffic police to busy thoroughfares, the authorities of the French Concession have recently installed automatic red-green traffic lights at many key intersections. Those that have been installed and are in use include: (1) Avenue Joffre and Rue Cardinal Mercier, (2) Avenue Joffre and Avenue Albert, (3) Avenue Joffre and Avenue Dubail, (4) Avenue Albert and Avenue Lafayette, (5) Route Père Robert and Avenue Lafayette, (6) Rue Say Zoong and Avenue Joffre, and (7) Avenue Joffre and Route Ma Lang.

### Three of the Six Ships Detained by the Japanese Have Now Unloaded Their Cargo. The Rest Are Being Monitored by Japanese Troops. Rising Prices Are a Major Reason.

Five German and Italian ships detained by the Japanese yesterday have been allowed to unload their cargo after repeated negotiations. However, the Italian merchant ship Santai was detained again by the Japanese Marine Military Police yesterday morning when it arrived at the Roosevelt Wharf from Jiangbei. The details are as follows:

Italian Ship Santai Loses 100,000

The Italian merchant ship Santai, with a displacement of 1,000 tons, regularly sails between Shanghai and Jiangbei. For half a year now, it had been carrying 1,570 bales of cotton from Qinglong Port to Shanghai. When it arrived at the Roosevelt Wharf at 7 AM yesterday morning, a small motorboat carrying several Japanese Marine Military Police boarded the ship and informed the crew that they were forbidden to unload the cargo. After some negotiations, permission to unload was granted at 1 PM. The reason for the detention is not certain, but it is rumored that the losses suffered amounted to more than 100,000 yuan.

Two More Ships Under Surveillance

The Italian merchant ships Liping, Lima, and Messina, which previously sailed from Jiangbei to Shanghai, were carrying silk cocoons, not cotton. After negotiations, the silk cocoons on the Liping were completely unloaded yesterday. However, the small boat dispatched by the Japanese Marine Military Police was still docked next to the Lima and Messina, which carried a total of 700 bales of silk cocoons, and the issue of unloading is still under negotiation.

Bellicon Unloads Cargo

The German merchant ships Haifu and Bellicon, which were detained at the same time as the three Italian ships mentioned above, were also detained. The Haifu regularly sails to the Zhejiang coast, while the Bellicon was only recently deciding to sail to Zhejiang. The two ships arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf, where they were immediately placed under surveillance by the Japanese Marine Military Police. However, the Bellicon reached an agreement with the Japanese side that day and unloaded its cargo yesterday. Two Japanese military police officers were still stationed on the Haifu yesterday. The cargo carried by the ship consists mainly of charcoal, straw paper, and Huangyan oranges.

### Last Month's Foreign Rice Arrivals

In addition to purchasing a portion of its food supply from domestic rice-producing areas, the city relies heavily on imports from Saigon, Siam, Rangoon, and other overseas locations. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Jianghai Customs yesterday that foreign rice shipments to the port totaled 368,939 quintals in November, with a value of 2,238,454 gold units, equivalent to 6,043,253 national currency yuan. The largest amount came from Annam (Saigon), totaling 335,468 quintals, valued at 2,005,568 gold units. The second largest was from Thailand (Siam), totaling 29,460 quintals, valued at 204,941 gold units. The third largest was from Hong Kong, totaling 4,005 quintals, valued at 2,876 gold units.

Eighth Phase of Stabilized Rice Sales

Regarding the eighth phase of stabilized rice sales, the Shanghai Stabilized Rice Sales Committee convened a full committee meeting on the 10th of this month and resolved to commence operations on January 2, 1941. Due to the large amount of funds required, it was resolved to raise an additional 100,000 yuan in donations. It is reported that industries such as flour, hardware, and rice have pledged sufficient amounts and are conducting fundraising among their respective industries. It is understood that all procedures for this stabilized rice sale will be similar to the previous phases. Each person will still be limited to purchasing one yuan of national currency, with each yuan purchasing four catties of rice. Each point will still be limited to selling 50 bags of rice. The stabilized rice sales points have been entrusted to members of the Rice Merchant Association.

### 240,000 Yuan Fur Coat Lawsuit: Price Still Needs to be Assessed. The Court Ordered a Hearing After the Assessment.

Zhou Fuzhou, the deceased wealthy salt merchant, had a fifth son, Zicheng, who died early, leaving behind a son named Pengling, who is 22 years old and currently studying at university. When Zicheng and his wife passed away one after another, Pengling was only eight years old. Therefore, Zicheng and his wife left behind a total of 301 boxes of movable property, which were inspected and sealed by relatives and friends in each room.

At that time, a total of 39 boxes of fur coats and other items were deposited with the eldest son, Zhou Zishan (Zhou Fuzhou's eldest grandson). The remaining 200-odd boxes were initially stored in the Gu Room and later transferred to the Chang Room. After Zhou Zishan passed away, his wife, Mrs. Mei (57 years old, from Ji'an, residing at No. 20, Lane 1400, Avenue Edward VII), inherited them. Because Pengling asked his widowed sister-in-law, Mrs. Mei, last year for the fur coats, Mrs. Mei said that 18 boxes of fur coats had been sold to pay off debts. Pengling believed that Mrs. Mei intended to embezzle a large amount of fur coats. This autumn, he hired lawyer Shan Yuhua to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court Civil Division, accusing Mrs. Mei and requesting the court to order Mrs. Mei to return 23 boxes of fur coats. If the original items cannot be returned, Pengling requested the court to order compensation for the value of the fur coats, totaling 240,000 national currency yuan. The court accepted the case.

The case was initially heard by Judge Wang Qufei, but later reassigned to Judge Guo. The defendant, Zhou Mei, insisted that there were indeed 18 boxes of fur coats, which Zhou Zishan had deducted to repay tens of thousands of yuan owed by Zhou Zicheng to Yuda Qianzhuang. The other 21 boxes were taken away or auctioned off by the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff, Zhou Pengling, insisted that there were a total of 23 boxes of fur coats, not just 18, and that there was no deduction. As for the auctioned items, they were not originally in the deposited boxes, and the boxes that were taken back were not the original ones either. Because Judge Guo felt that it was necessary to conduct an on-site inspection at the plaintiff's residence based on the plaintiff's statements, he personally conducted the inspection a month ago. Because it was also necessary to have experts assess the value of the fur coats in dispute, the court ordered a hearing after the assessment.

### Social News

At 8:45 AM on the 20th, an elderly woman of about 50 years old, whose name is unknown, was walking along the tram tracks in front of No. 89 Bund, French Concession, from south to north. A French tram No. 5 (traveling between the 16th Wharf and Avenue Foch) was traveling in the same direction behind her. The elderly woman failed to avoid it and was knocked down, sustaining head injuries. She was taken to Guangci Hospital by the police, but she died at 5 PM the following day. The body was sent to the coroner's office to await identification.

Zhao Genlin, a sanitation worker from Jiangbei, working for the Public Works Department, 39 years old, residing at No. 115, Lane 19, Connaught Road, was clearing garbage from the sidewalk at the intersection of Tongfu Road at around 5 AM yesterday morning when he saw a wire hanging down. He went forward to pull it down, but accidentally touched the electrical current. After being discovered and rescued, he was barely breathing. He was sent to Baolong Hospital but was pronounced dead.

### Inheritance Dispute of the Former Principal of Zhengxing Girls' School: Gong Gu Allegedly Concealed Property. The Court Adjourned the Hearing Because the Heirs Did Not Appear.

Gong Hongzhao, the former principal of Zhengxing Girls' School, chairman of Boji Hospital, member of the Shanghai Bar Association, and native of Chongming, passed away on June 24 last year. His wife, Mrs. Gu, had no children, while his concubine, Shen Yaoying, 28 years old this year, is the eldest daughter of Shen Zhujiu, a wealthy merchant from Chongming. She received a university education and taught for many years. She fell in love with Gong and voluntarily became his concubine. However, she did not get along with the first wife, Mrs. Gu, so she returned to her mother's home. Shen Zhujiu claimed that his daughter Yaoying had eloped with Gong in July of the year before last, taking with her 40 gold pounds, several taels of gold jewelry, and a large amount of cash, all of which were deposited by Gong in a bank safe deposit box. Therefore, in addition to wanting to recover the large sum of money taken by his daughter, Shen also wanted to claim a large debt from Gong's heirs.

Gong's first wife, Mrs. Gu, filed a petition in the First Special Court last year, requesting a limited inheritance, claiming that Gong's estate was small and only sufficient to repay debts. Shen Zhujiu accused Gong Gu of repeatedly opening the safe deposit box without authorization after applying for a limited inheritance, believing that Gong Gu had concealed the estate. Therefore, he recently hired lawyer Yu Chengxiu to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court Civil Division, opposing Gong Gu's application for a limited inheritance. The case is currently being heard in the Civil Division 1 by Judge Tao. The defendant, Gong Gu, claimed to be ill and did not attend the hearing. Lawyer Lu Jia acted as her representative. Shen Zhujiu arrived on time with his representative lawyer and explained in detail how Gong Gu concealed the estate. The court, after reviewing the statements, ordered an adjournment for further investigation.

### Gifts for Women

— Ying Dai

——What They Need——

The Winter Solstice and New Year are good times to give gifts, but if your gifts are for women, then what do they need? What do they like? This becomes a problem. Although most men have a kind of self-confidence, women's hobbies are different from men's. Most housewives like gifts that are for household use and can reduce the hardship of housework. Rouge and powder can sometimes be given as gifts, but they are not welcomed by every housewife. Therefore, many housewives like gifts that reduce the trouble in their work. For example, a kitchen knife can make cutting meat and vegetables faster, and a new pair of scissors can make clothing tailoring faster, which will make them particularly welcome. Other things like kitchen utensils, even a bowl or a spoon, will also be welcomed by economical housewives. Because these can save them some money or reduce expenses, and even if no one gives them, they will have to buy them themselves.

Every year, before the Winter Solstice and New Year, most housewives are always busy going to the streets to stroll around, looking into every shop window, wanting to see something they like and buy it back. However, what disappoints them is that many things are very expensive, and their economic power is not enough to buy them, so they can only sigh at the window. Therefore, if the gift-giver can see, from a psychological point of view, what things they will need to buy, and buy them and send them, then they will definitely have a kind of unspeakable joy when they receive them. It's as if you know their hearts. Like towels and handkerchiefs, these are also practical items that housewives like. Perhaps men will never know that ordinary women always feel that there are too few towels. Because adults, children, and even servants have to use towels, and towels are also very easy to break. This way, if you send some towels, you will naturally be especially welcome.

Although it is not very common in China, in the West, sons who work outside also buy gifts for their mothers for Christmas and New Year. If their economic power allows, this gift will naturally be very valuable. But these sons will also consider what their mothers need? What do they like? What kind of thing is most suitable for household use? Under these many considerations, some will even buy a set of electric tableware as a gift. In short, a woman's preferences are completely different before and after marriage, so the gifts you buy for young girls are completely different from the gifts you give to housewives. For the former, personal items are important, like fragrant powders, perfumes, gloves, handkerchiefs, and socks are the most welcome; while the latter welcomes practical items for the home. Because they have put their personal dress aside, and the most important thing is to manage the family.

### Please Save Christmas Expenses to Help Refugees

— Qiu Lang

Yesterday was just the Chinese Winter Solstice Festival, and the Christmas holiday is coming right after tomorrow (the 25th). The Shanghai people admire European customs, and they have faintly forgotten about the Chinese Winter Solstice, but they are going to celebrate this foreign Winter Solstice, Christmas, with great enthusiasm! Although the current Shanghai is an isolated island, those fashionable men and women will inevitably use eating and playing to have fun. The places to play are watching movies and dancing; in terms of eating, there are Christmas dinners, Christmas candies, and white hat cakes; and turkey, a famous dish, is indispensable at dinner parties. However, now that prices are soaring, foreign turkeys are very expensive due to the tightening of foreign exchange, and the prices of local Zhoushan turkeys are also surprisingly high due to transportation difficulties and export restrictions. Therefore, it is conceivable that this year's turkey will be the most expensive delicacy.

Due to the prolonged war in the country, prices are soaring, continuing to rise. On this isolated island, the existing refugees are in a state of hunger and cold. Although relief organizations are trying their best to maintain them, they still feel it is difficult. Other poor households, with the rising cost of living, have no way to survive and are about to become new refugees. There are even more of them! Jesus mainly focused on universal love and saving the world, so Christians call him the savior and have gained the faith of the masses. Therefore, on this Christmas, we should certainly commemorate him, but at the same time, we should uphold his universal love doctrine. During this difficult and hard time, we must not be too extravagant. Please save the money for eating expensive turkeys and other things to help the poor refugees, so as not to fail the original intention of the savior.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Some families have been celebrating the Winter Solstice Festival these days, and the prices of chicken, duck, fish, and meat have increased due to the large number of people who need them. Even chicken eggs have to be bought for 20 cents each. The relatively cheaper ones are still vegetables, so my family eats a lot of vegetables these days. Fortunately, both the large green vegetables and the Tatarian aster have been hit by frost and have a sweet taste. I once ate Tatarian aster bought from Xujiahui, and the vegetable was very soft and glutinous, really melting in the mouth, and the vegetable heart was so delicious, it was really better than meat. The price of vegetables is now about 10 cents per catty. Whether you stir-fry them alone or add some auxiliary ingredients, you need to use more oil and not less sugar. If you put too little oil and sugar, the taste will be a little worse.

### Life's Problems

— Yu Gong

Recently, rice and coal prices have been soaring, causing endless complaints among the people of Shanghai. Although the Rice and Coal Associations have tried their best to lower prices, they have only become more rampant. This is not surprising, as rising prices benefit those in the trade, while falling prices result in losses. The public hopes for lower prices, while traders seek higher prices. Therefore, they outwardly pretend to lower prices while secretly plotting to increase them, seeking to lower prices is merely a superficial gesture. Since we, the people, lack the ability to lower prices, we must strive to find ways to cope with this harsh environment.

Group purchasing of rice has already been proposed, but group cooking is still lacking. I believe that in this world, only the power of the collective can achieve true benefits. I hope that the suffering masses will once again advocate for group cooking to solve their own living problems. (Thank you for your contribution)

### Desk Arrangement

— Ai Li

Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is precious. In recent years, new-style residences have become increasingly smaller, with each room being as small as possible. The ancient terms "snail dwelling" and "tiny room" seem to be coming true. Because residences are small and rooms are small, the furniture used is also smaller. Wall paintings and calligraphy are mostly in the form of small horizontal scrolls with frames. Even the stationery and decorations placed on the desk need to be small. Among the decorations suitable for the desk, small potted plants are the most appropriate. A small pot of flowers and plants placed in front of one can allow those sitting at the desk to read, write, or work to occasionally look up in their busy lives, truly pleasing the mood and forgetting the fatigue of work. Calling it a "desk arrangement" is certainly fitting. Potted landscape expert Mr. Kong Zhiqing, in response to societal demand, has specially created many small potted landscapes of flowers, trees, and rocks. Each pot has artistic merit and has already received high praise from enthusiasts. Recently, a small exhibition was opened at the Parkson Shopping Center, which is quite worth seeing. At the same time, Huaxing Flower Garden has transported many old plum trees from Dengwei Mountain in Suzhou and displayed them there. The old trunks and gnarled branches naturally possess a sense of sparse shadows slanting across the water. The buds are gradually enlarging, indicating that the days of subtle fragrance are coming soon. Yesterday, I went for a tour and felt as if I had entered a fragrant kingdom, happily forgetting to return.

### First Aid for Coal Gas Poisoning

— Wang Wanqing

As winter arrives and the weather turns cold, most people in the lower and middle classes, lacking the means to afford water heaters or stoves for warmth, often resort to using coal briquette stoves indoors as a substitute. However, because coal briquette stoves lack chimney installations, and windows are tightly closed, the carbon monoxide (coal gas) produced by the burning of coal briquettes cannot escape and accumulates in the room. Furthermore, due to the continuous burning of coal briquettes, the carbon monoxide in the room accumulates more and more, and people living in it can become poisoned by coal gas over time.

Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless. Its affinity for hemoglobin is two to three hundred times greater than that of oxygen. Severe poisoning can lead to sudden death. Milder cases initially cause headaches, followed by general weakness, mental confusion, and ultimately loss of consciousness. The emergency treatment is to quickly move the poisoned person to a place with good ventilation. If the congestion is too severe or breathing has stopped, artificial respiration should be performed immediately. In addition, a mixture of oxygen and five percent carbon dioxide should be frequently inhaled by the poisoned person. This is the most effective method for treating coal gas poisoning. After regaining consciousness, the patient must be kept warm and given adequate rest. Oral or injected medications are generally ineffective. It is also said that administering old mustard brine or white radish juice to coal gas poisoning victims is very effective and is recorded as an aid for emergency treatment.

### Zhao Zilong Washing Horse Pond

— Shu Ping

Sichuan, with its vast territory and abundant resources, is historically known as the "Land of Abundance," a rich and fertile country. Its mountains and rivers are treacherous, making it a central area for resistance and reconstruction. Since the founding of the Republic of China, wars have been frequent, with no peaceful days. The people's strength has been exhausted, and more than half of the historical sites have been destroyed.

After the Three Kingdoms period, the great achievements and relics left by heroic figures are countless. Zhao Zilong's Washing Horse Pond is one of the most important.

Zhao Zilong's loyalty and martial prowess are second only to Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. Never forgetting his martial duties, he engaged in washing his horses during his leisure time. Today, the remnants of his pond are located outside Chengdu. Although the nearby houses have been renovated, the pond is now desolate.

Although there are many historical sites in Sichuan, the natural treasures and unique products grown there are also the best in all provinces. "Silver fungus," a nourishing product, is also a valuable product of Sichuan.

### Year-End Decline

— Tang Jin

The cold wind whistles, and the few remaining yellow leaves on the branches of the scattered plane trees on the road are also destroyed. The report from the Xujiahui Observatory states: A cold wave has struck the "isolated island" from West Asia, and the temperature has dropped to three degrees Celsius below freezing, what unprecedented cold!…

Year-end decline, I am aware of the conditions of this winter season.

In my faint memory of my hometown, winter is the most desolate season. The autumn harvest has ended completely, filling the faces of the old farmers with joyful feelings. "Hibernating," "warming up," isn't this the time for them to pat their legs and prepare to spend the year, pounding rice cakes, making glutinous rice balls, pulling water mills…? The liveliness of human relationships fills the entire village.

But now, the suffering of the motherland has not unexpectedly escaped them after all. From the letter that Dad wrote three months ago, in the squirming strokes, I seem to see that uneasy situation: The price of rice has already risen to eighty-five yuan per picul! Sugar, oil,… are all above one yuan per catty. The once verdant mountains and forests now mostly have only yellow mud and empty shells left, the reason said is that because the price of firewood has risen, the number of people cutting firewood has suddenly increased… In a life of suffering, who among our fellow villagers would forget the "warming up," "hibernating" season? But at this time, Dad tells me: Everyone knows that the storm is coming, at present. And those who dominate, the fierce ones…

I felt a chill of desolation!

I also witnessed my own reality, being on an isolated island in a state of numbness.

— The cold wind is blowing, the sky is being dragged by strangely colored flags, countless flags, and the streets are also fluttering with many flags, those are discount flags.

"Winter Solstice Sale," "Winter Solstice Sale Big Discount"…

…X’Mas Sale 1940…

Nanjing Road, Sichuan Road, Avenue Joffre… are showing another face, revealing various situations. In the glass display windows of large companies, we are made even more sensitive to winter, with patches of white snow, no, the whole ground is covered with pure white snow: Not just one, countless, countless old men, red-clothed white-bearded, foreign-hatted, should be uncommon old friends, as if squatting on the flawless snow; Once a year, the old friend has not forgotten his large package, coffee, candy, milk… enough Christmas gifts.

(I think that at this time and in this place, the most numerous children of God hope to be given more gifts of white rice to relieve the suffering of hunger.)

On the roads embraced by the cold wind, crowded and bustling, the happy children of God are in the shops decorated in a riot of colors, dazzling the eyes, filled with a clamor, Ding! Ding! Ding! The sound of the urging bell stirs up an even more tense scene here, with crowds jostling each other, red paper, green paper… weaving together into a beautiful scene.

They and she are buying gifts for another group of happy people for the winter solstice.

If you (also considered one of the happy ones) have not gone to be squeezed, then the biggest newspaper advertisements in the next few days can individually tell you, and you can choose at will.

But after all, Shanghai is still an international city today, a prosperous (?) city, no, even more a paradise for adventurers, the lively situation is multifaceted, here is another kind of lively method that I read from the same newspaper:

“…Houses in Lane So-and-So were demolished, and residents in Lane So-and-So were ordered to move out, resulting in homelessness, with as many as two thousand people, it is said…”

"The darkness of the rice market, the commission fees have risen, and there is even a black market, the rice merchants are extremely fierce, the small people struggling in the cold and hunger…" "The British-owned public buses announced a 35% increase in fares, further increasing the burden on citizens' transportation…"

"Western clothing workers on Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road are on strike, demanding a wage increase…"

"Due to poor business and excessive losses, Yunnan businessman Xiao Pengnian committed suicide by slitting his throat…"

Is a series of commotions, ceaselessly weaving another movement of the money twilight march.

It is the season of year-end decline…

### Round Moon, Rising Water, Round Dumplings

### The Story of Rice

— Yong

There was a large granary, with high walls all around, and the rice inside was piled as high as the walls.

Later, the ants outside the wall discovered a small hole. So, one ant crawled in and carried a grain of rice out; a second ant also crawled in and carried a grain of rice out; and another ant crawled in and carried a grain of rice out; and another…

According to me, this story cannot be finished.

Although the storyteller thought himself clever, this story is precisely a failure. As long as we have a tiny force like ants, the rice in such a large granary will surely be carried away one day.

This is just a matter of time!

(6) Words Still Ring in My Ears

Qian Muzhai was certainly enjoying himself in the gentleness and tenderness, passing the year in a leisurely manner. But the Central Plains were boiling, the world was in great chaos, the rebel leader Li Zicheng was causing havoc in the country, and the Qing troops entered the Pass. The Ming Dynasty was at a critical moment of survival. Prince Fu, Zhu Yousong, was propped up in Nanjing by the masses, but the building was about to collapse, and a single tree was hard to support. The situation was like a storm, and no one could predict the end. Moreover, among the court officials were figures like Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng, who were昏庸and misguided the country, harming the loyal and virtuous. Shi Kefa supervised the army in Yangzhou, struggling to support the situation, but ultimately could not clear out the 君側 and was focused on fighting the outside. Although Qian Muzhai held a position in Nanjing at this time, he was associated with Ma Shiying and others, indulging in poetry and wine, singing and dancing, but he already had a sense of twilight. He was indifferent to matters of state and could not rise to action. Liu Rushi, however, often nagged in Muzhai's ear, urging him to be upright in the court and not to flatter powerful villains. Although Muzhai admired her words, he could not use them, so he had no political achievements in the court. He often returned to Yushan, composing poetry and singing about flowers and willows with Liu Rushi, indulging in leisure and pleasure. Liu Rushi became somewhat impatient. At that time, Liu Rushi already had a daughter. She wholeheartedly raised her daughter, teaching her to read and write. Gradually, the Qing troops moved south, and the situation worsened day by day. The corner of Jiangzuo was on the verge of collapse. Liu Rushi sat alone in her deep boudoir, hearing the ominous news from outside, and her heart was filled with sorrow and loneliness. Recalling the previous times by the Rainbow Bridge, boating for pleasure, in the courtyard of the women's home, reciting poetry and admiring the moon, all kinds of past events were like dreams, and looking back was unbearable. Her teacher, Zhang Tianru, had already passed away several years ago, and she had sent him one hundred taels of alms. And her sister, Feng Zi, vowed never to marry, reciting the Lengyan Sutra and the Diamond Sutra every day, and devoting herself to禪悅. Sometimes, wearing a cloth robe and carrying a bamboo staff, she traveled through the mountains and rivers, living in seclusion and never coming out. She had never been to Yushan, even though they were as close as sisters. Isn't it even more lamentable that they were separated like swallows and could not meet? One day, Qian Muzhai suddenly returned home from Nanjing again to comfort Rushi. Seeing her sitting alone in the upstairs, he said with a smile: "Are you alone in your boudoir, do you have the feeling of a 思婦?" Liu Rushi sighed slightly and said, "I don't have such worries. What I'm worried about is that the country is in danger, the Qing troops are coming south, and the counties in Jiangnan are in danger of being lost at any moment." Qian Muzhai sat beside Liu Rushi, holding a teacup, and after taking a sip, he continued: "The situation in Nanjing is indeed very critical. I'm afraid that although Lord Shi is in Jiangdu and is resisting with all his might, he will ultimately not be able to withstand the strong Qing troops. Some ministers in the court are also advocating surrender, so we are very worried." Liu Rushi said: "I have a question to ask you, Xiang Gong. If the Qing troops cross the river and Nanjing falls, then what preparations will you make? Will you be a bitch?" Qian Muzhai was slightly stunned: "What bitch? I don't understand. Please tell me." Liu Rushi smiled and said: "I heard it too. It is said that a tutor taught a student to read the "Book of Rites," and read the sentence "When facing wealth, do not be greedy; when facing disaster, do not avoid" as "When facing wealth, the bitch can get it; when facing disaster, the bitch is exempt." Someone who heard it asked what it meant, and the tutor explained the word苟 as "dog," and said that when facing wealth, the bitch can get it, and when facing disaster, the bitch is uniquely exempt. Everyone laughed and said, "Then the bitch is the cheapest in the world." (18)

### Santa Claus

— Jue Hui

As usual, at exactly midnight on the evening of December 24th every year, Santa Claus would shoulder a large bag of gifts to distribute to the children (poor children are naturally not included), it is said to be "true."

Also as usual, waking up from a sweet dream the next morning and seeing the gifts next to their pillows, the children would be so happy that they couldn't close their mouths; and, they would definitely insist that the paw prints of the foreign dog on the floor were the ironclad proof that Santa Claus had been there!

Many, many years passed…

The child became "nervous," peeking with squinted eyes in the middle of the night: Mother sneaked in like a thief, placing a sock full of things next to the pillow. — "So it was people playing tricks!"

Many, many more years passed…

The child "reserved" with their mother the night before: "Mom! The sock needs to be bigger tomorrow night…" Thus, the paper tiger was punctured, and the secret became public.

Now, everyone knows that there is no Santa Claus; but everyone pretends to know that there is a Santa Claus…

In the end: Santa Claus? or Santa Laborer?
