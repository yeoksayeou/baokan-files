### If the Japanese Army Lands in Saigon, the Chinese Army Will Naturally Assist Britain and America; If Britain and America Can Supply China with Aircraft and Other Military Supplies, the Chinese Army Will Launch a Large-Scale Counter-Offensive to Prevent the Japanese Advance Southward; Relations Between Vietnam and Thailand Remain Tense

Chongqing - All sectors of the Chinese population here are now paying attention to the developments in Vietnam. It is rumored that the Japanese are preparing to send troops to land in Saigon. Therefore, observers are closely watching the attitudes of Britain and America. Well-informed observers say that the developments in Saigon are related to the talks in Vienna. They suspect that the attack on Greece by the Italian army was not first approved by Germany. Before actively participating in the Balkan war, Germany is currently busy consulting with other Balkan countries in order to reach an understanding and to pay attention to the Soviet Union. Germany is doing this in an attempt to prevent Britain from concentrating its efforts in the Balkans. Therefore, it is currently trying to persuade Spain to attack Gibraltar. Observers do not believe that Japan will take the reckless action of attacking Singapore and the Dutch East Indies before the outcome of the Balkan war is clear. Therefore, Japan will first occupy Saigon, and then, when the development of the European war is favorable to Japan, use Saigon as a base for continuing its southward advance. It is noteworthy that Japan has recently adopted a peaceful offensive. This news is spread by Japan to the outside world in order to reassure Germany, so that it knows that there is hope for an early resolution of the Sino-Japanese war; to give Washington and London the impression that the overall situation in the Far East can still be stabilized through a policy of appeasement; to cause misunderstandings between China and the British and American powers and among the various factions in Chongqing and the free areas of China; and to appease the internal Japanese desire for early peace. However, Chongqing has announced its determination to continue the war until a fair and honorable peace is achieved. At the same time, there is continued speculation about what possible measures China will take in the event that the Japanese land in Saigon or attack Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. Some suggest that China attack Japanese bases in Vietnam and assist Britain and America in the Far East. Many believe that if Britain and America supply China with aircraft and other military supplies, the Chinese army can launch a large-scale counter-offensive on all fronts. Some Chinese even believe that the Chinese army may be able to recover Nanchang, Hankou, and Jiujiang, and drive the Japanese army eastward to retreat down the Yangtze River. The Chinese army on the border between Guangxi and Yunnan can also attack the flanks of the Japanese army in northern Vietnam, and seriously hinder Japanese actions against Britain and America in the South China Sea. Although the Chinese are not overly optimistic about the chance of decisively defeating the Japanese army, they all feel that this counter-offensive will at least provide Britain and America with valuable assistance in the Far East.

### The United States Strengthens Aid to Britain; Sends Army and Air Force Officers to Investigate the War Situation; "Flying Fortresses" Will Be Transferred First Twenty Aircraft

Washington - U.S. Chief of Staff General Marshall announced yesterday that the Sperry bomb sights used by U.S. Army aircraft have now been delivered to Britain, but the secret sights used by the military, technically known as Norden sights, have not been delivered to Britain. Many U.S. Army inspection commissioners have been sent to Britain in batches, and are now in Britain to conduct on-the-ground investigations of the actual situation of the war, and to consult with British military leaders. General Marshall continued to say that the U.S. government has also sent military attachés via the Cape of Good Hope to Egypt to study the war. However, it is not yet known whether they have arrived in Egypt. The U.S. Air Force team and anti-aircraft artillery team are now also in Britain. Air Force inspectors often attach themselves to British bombers and fly over Britain and the English Channel, but have never flown over Germany or German-occupied territory. The British government has now released a number of engine components to the U.S. to be fitted to the forty-one "Flying Fortresses" built by the U.S. This is in exchange for priority delivery rights for the "Unified Type" bombers built by the U.S. After consultations between the two countries, twenty "Flying Fortresses," all of the latest type and fully equipped, will be transferred first, but without the Norden sights. Three of these aircraft can be delivered by the end of November, and the remaining twenty will not be completed until March 1.

The two also provided assurances to Assistant Secretary of State Dr. Galaugher that the Philippines will provide the United States with full cooperation in resolving economic issues in the Far East. This guarantee from the Philippines is merely a reaffirmation of the country's position in the Far East. It is said that the understanding and sympathy between the United States and the Philippines have greatly increased.

Editorial

### How Should the United States Aid China?

What kind of more effective and powerful assistance will the United States give to China? How to assist? When to assist?

The United States has provided aid to China for three years, and the aid has had considerable power and effectiveness, which is a fact. American scholars, professors, and the general public have repeatedly called for and launched aid to China. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox recently declared that he would provide aid to China with the same quality and quantity as he provides aid to Britain. This is the highest friendship. The Chinese side not only thanks him for this, but also deeply remembers it. China has not expressed dissatisfaction, but hopes to immediately receive various most effective and powerful assistance. This kind of psychology is difficult to describe in accounting terms.

On the American side, regarding the issue of aid to China, most outstanding sages and people with only common sense unanimously recognize the necessity of vigorous assistance, which has become the national policy of the United States. In addition, there is another group of people with different opinions, including a number of utilitarians and isolationists. Originally, the original intention of isolationists was not negative towards the Far East. Only because of maintaining their isolationist principle, there were some who did not actively advocate vigorous assistance to China. Far-sighted utilitarians can of course confirm the value of vigorous assistance to China, but those with short-sightedness, who have absolutely no interest in the so-called spirit of the treaty and the so-called international justice, who only plan to make profits every day, who do not care about the nature of the profits, who do not care about the bloody nature of the profits, and who think that aid to China is not a good deal are quite a few. These are not enough to represent the American people, nor are they enough to shake the national policy of the United States. However, within the democratic American organization, they have their own legitimate status that cannot be denied and should be given considerable respect. This was the case in the past, and it will be the case in the future. Therefore, when the United States implements its policy of aiding China, it will inevitably encounter considerable friction, and it will advance gradually and not very happily, which is not unexpected. What is gratifying is that since Japan flaunted the New Order in East Asia, and loudly declared that its scope extended to the Dutch East Indies, and then immediately sent troops to Vietnam after declaring that it would maintain the status quo in Vietnam, and then concluded an alliance with Germany and Italy, clearly indicating that it was incompatible with the democratic countries, and repeatedly stated that a US-Japan war was inevitable, the public opinion in the United States that supported its national policy has become more widespread and stronger, and the possibility of stepping up aid to China in the future will inevitably increase compared with the past.

In recent days, there have been various rumors about the content of possible US aid to China, all of which need to be confirmed and cannot be believed immediately. Before the U.S. Secretary of the Navy announces vigorous aid and decides to implement vigorous aid, we sincerely hope that the U.S. government and the public will give more consideration to the following points: First, for the sake of clarifying the entire world situation, which is more beneficial to support the current situation in the Far East war by China, or to strive for victory by China as soon as possible to lay the foundation for the Far East in advance? Second, when is the South Pacific crisis more likely to erupt and easier to avoid, when the war in the Far East is deadlocked, or when China is capable of launching a large-scale counter-offensive? Third, if China wins a decisive victory, or has seen a significant military advantage, is it possible to eliminate the Pacific crisis immediately? Fourth, for the two aggressive forces in Asia and Europe, from all aspects of calculation, should we inevitably stop the easier one first, or should we tolerate and follow the same old path, fostering a total solution that must be personally participated in by the United States? Fifth, assuming that Britain does not win in Europe, or wins but not completely, what will be the situation if the Far East has fortunately been stabilized first? Unfortunately, if the Far East is still in a difficult and incomprehensible situation, then what will be the situation? Which one is more stable? Sixth, after the Far East is stabilized first, wouldn't China also be able to make a great contribution to the stability of the overall world situation? Seventh, is the reason for vigorous assistance to China that we have more necessary reasons for interest in addition to justice and sympathy? Eighth, is the value of vigorous assistance to China worthy of greater consideration than the commercial method and the general credit system?

We do not know what answers and measures the US government and the public will get after considering the above eight points. We firmly believe that the United States has taken aid to China as one of the important current policies, and the previous aid has its own considerable strength and effectiveness. However, the so-called strength and the so-called effectiveness still need to immediately consider their standards. For example, with medicine, a certain amount is enough to prevent deterioration, and a certain amount is enough to maintain the body. This is what is meant by having considerable strength and considerable effectiveness. However, a certain amount must be invested to eliminate evil and detoxify, strengthen muscles, bones, and internal organs, and restore health. This is awaiting for the authorities of China and the United States to deliberate on the prescription, and the appropriate amount of supply depends on the generosity of the American government and the public.

Rumors Bulgaria May Demand Territory from Greece

Sofia - Rumors spread here today that Bulgaria may soon issue an ultimatum to Greece, demanding the cession of Thrace and Macedonia, so that Bulgarians may obtain a path to the Aegean Sea. At the same time, it is rumored that diplomatic circles in Sofia believe that Germany may soon begin large-scale military operations in the Balkans to end the Italo-Greek war and occupy Thessaloniki as a base for the Axis powers to attack Syria and Egypt.

Germany and Italy Lure Hungary into the Alliance, Intending to Threaten Neutral Countries

London - After Hungary joined the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, Hitler and Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csaky held talks for two hours at the Imperial Hotel in Vienna yesterday afternoon. Hitler then received Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. According to the opinion of Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, although Hungary has now joined the Axis powers, its current situation is not enough to affect the overall European situation, because Hungary's group is not a sudden change of attitude from friend to foe. Since the outbreak of the war, Hungary has had no other option but to lean towards the Axis powers, and its policy has had to shift with the policies of Germany and Italy. Hungary's accession to the Axis alliance will of course not immediately plunge Hungary into war. Its greatest contribution to the Axis powers is to set an example, because Germany and Italy hope that other small neutral countries will follow in Hungary's footsteps and secretly threaten neutral countries that if they do not join at this time, they will permanently lose the favor of Germany and Italy. (Reuters, 21st)

London - According to authoritative sources in London today, Hungary's participation in the Axis powers' agreement with Japan is a prelude to Germany's plan to strike Greece and then attack the Dardanelles. When the initial news of Hungary's action reached London, the British government did not express surprise. They pointed out that Hungary had long been considered a German protectorate. (International News Agency, 21st)

The German and Italian Newspapers Welcome Hungary's Accession to the Tripartite Pact

Rome - Political figures here warmly welcome Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact, saying that this important political event is related to the meeting held by German Leader Hitler and Italian Leader Mussolini in Brenner and Florence, during which a plan was formulated on the political, diplomatic, and military aspects of continuing the war. The young countries not only decided to continue fighting until Britain was defeated, but also attached importance to the new order in Europe. Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact is the first step in a new attitude after diplomatic activity. Its purpose is to unite countries that support the Axis powers and jointly build a new European order. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Berlin - Yesterday, newspapers here regarded Hungary's participation in the Tripartite Pact as clear evidence that the Axis powers have an absolute advantage in the current war and as a new blow to British continental policy. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated that the establishment of the Tripartite Pact lays the foundation for the restructuring of the world. Hungary's accession makes its effectiveness even more obvious, and Britain's friends are becoming fewer and fewer. This is the ebb and flow between Britain and the Axis powers. Britain is constantly subjected to this kind of effective blow day and night, and the Axis powers' actions within its sphere of influence are becoming more free and unhindered. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Berlin - Regarding Hungary's union with the Tripartite Pact, German officials believe that this is Hungary's recognition of its current and future status. The main purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to prevent the expansion of the war and restore a fair peace as soon as possible. Therefore, the war significance of the three countries, from a military and diplomatic point of view, is to build a new order related to the interests of the three countries and promote the lives and living standards of the people within that scope. Hungary is the first Balkan country to join the Tripartite Pact. Hungary is a country that suffered peace sacrifices after the World War. Only Germany and Italy understand its situation and help it resist unfair treatment. Hungary is now joining the Tripartite Pact to express its gratitude and jointly build a new European order based on fairness. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Berlin - The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung commented today on Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact, saying that the attractiveness of the Tripartite Pact to other countries has caused Britain's power in Europe to melt like ice and snow. The power of facts and strength is like a flywheel, dragging countries that are unwilling to pay attention to the new era in Europe into the whirlpool. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Sofia - Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact has aroused great interest among the people of Bulgaria. Bulgarian newspapers yesterday published this important news on the front page, but did not comment on it, only quoting German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop as saying that other countries will soon follow in Hungary's footsteps and join the Tripartite Pact. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Rome - Last night, the Italian newspapers all published commentaries on Hungary's participation in the Axis group. The Gazzetta del Popolo commented that Ciano's visit to Germany has brought new developments in Axis politics. Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact has artificially increased the strength of the Axis powers. The spirit of cooperation among the Axis powers often arouses the neighboring policies of the Danube countries. It is hoped that the relationship between Hungary and Romania can be resolved satisfactorily. According to propaganda from political figures yesterday, Hungary and Romania have both expressed their willingness to resolve various outstanding issues in a spirit of friendship.

It is claimed that in the western part of the Greek-Albanian sector, Greek troops have for the first time invaded Italian territory, and in the northeast of the border, Greek troops have invaded the gateway to Korçë. A Greek communiqué states that the advance of Greek troops has been followed by new victories in the central Albanian region north of the Pindus Mountains, and that Greek troops have almost completely occupied the peaks of the Morava Mountains in their bloody siege of Korçë. The advancing Greek troops captured hundreds of Italian soldiers, dozens of artillery pieces of various types, large amounts of military equipment and ammunition, several tanks, and countless supplies. The fighting, which had been going on for several days, reached its peak yesterday morning. The advance was particularly fierce near the road from Kalibaki to Prelia, and therefore the Greek breakthrough was finally successful. The main route of the Italian retreat from Korçë to the Adriatic coast has been seriously threatened since Greek forces made progress in Epirus. (International News Agency, 21st)

Athens - Greek troops, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, reportedly broke through the Italian defense lines in several places in Albanian territory yesterday and pushed the Greek front lines forward, threatening the highway between Korçë and the coast. Greek troops in the Aoös River area fought fiercely all day and have cut the Italian line in two, isolating the Italian garrison in Korçë. Greek reports state that they are showing signs of collapse. Greek Air Force personnel say that Italian planes did not sortie all day. Greek wireless reports state that Greek troops are only twenty miles from Tepelenë, which is an important Italian transportation hub within Albania. At the same time, it is reported that Italian planes are continuing to bomb Greek front-line positions near Korçë, and the sound of artillery can be heard all night, which is proof that Italian troops are preparing for a major counterattack to rescue Korçë from being occupied by Greek troops. The Greek government has declared that Greek troops have completely cleared Italian troops from Greek territory. This declaration confirms previous reports that there are no Italian troops in Greece except for prisoners of war. British and Greek aircraft continue to bomb Italian bases, troop concentrations, and artillery positions in Albania. (International News Agency, 21st)

Athens - General Papagos, the commander-in-chief of the Greek forces, praised the bravery and sacrifice of the Greek Air Force in fighting against an enemy with absolute superiority, and the assistance they provided to the ground forces. (Reuters, 21st)

Rome - According to the Italian High Command, Italian troops on the Greek front near Korçë are resisting stubbornly. Repeated Greek attacks have been repulsed. Italian aircraft attacked the areas of Preveza and Korçë. Four planes did not return. Italian aircraft attacked Malta, hitting the airfield and arsenal. Italian aircraft suffered no losses. A British Wellington aircraft was forced to land in Sicily. All seven people on board, including Lieutenant Commander Dodd and four officers, were captured.

A Greek Division Advances, Approaching Tepelenë

Athens - A Greek division based in the Ioannina area advanced yesterday after heavy bombardment by aircraft and artillery, and is now twenty miles from Tepelenë, the most important Italian transportation hub north of Argyrokastron. On Tuesday night, the British Air Force engaged Italian aircraft and shot down nine Italian aircraft, while the British suffered no losses. As a result, the Italians are wary and have not dared to launch large-scale air raids. According to Greek reports, Greek fighter patrols yesterday failed to make contact with enemy aircraft because the enemy aircraft fled as soon as they saw Greek aircraft. It is reported that Greek troops advanced yesterday and captured a large amount of war materiel, including some transport vehicles and artillery. (Reuters, 21st)

A Squadron of British Aircraft Assists in the Battle, Shooting Down Nine Italian Aircraft

Cairo - Recent communiqués state that the British Air Force stationed in the Middle East is rapidly expanding its activities. A squadron of British aircraft arrived on the Greek front on Sunday and took off to engage in combat only a few hours after being stationed in the operational base, winning a resounding victory by shooting down nine Italian aircraft. In addition to a squadron of Australian aircraft shooting down five Italian aircraft and the South African Air Force attacking Bardia in Italian Somaliland twice, British aircraft have also flown to Italian East Africa and North Africa to attack, with considerable success. On the night of the 16th to 17th of this month, British long-range bombers attacked Bari, and one bomb hit the main central pier, causing an explosion, and the ships berthed next to the pier were also heavily damaged. The next night, British aircraft bombed Benghazi in Libya, with two bombs hitting ships in the port. The ammunition depot at Berka was bombed and exploded, and the aircraft hangar was also hit. The central aircraft hangar at Benina caught fire after being hit. The barracks at Tobruk were attacked and bombed. On the same night, Gura in Italian East Africa was bombed again, and a large warehouse caught fire. Other targets, such as merchant ships in the port of Massawa and military storage facilities in Kassala, and the railway lines at Agordat and Keren, were also bombed. The British sorties only lost one aircraft. (Reuters, 21st)

Italy Attempts to Pass Through Yugoslavia, But Is Stopped by Yugoslav Forces

Sofia - According to a report from the Athens Radio Station, "Officials have confirmed that Italian troops attempted to cross the Yugoslav border to attack the rear of the Greek troops, but were stopped by Yugoslav troops equipped with 400 machine guns." United Press notes that if this statement is true, then this should be the first contact between the Yugoslav and Italian forces. (The 21st)

Mutiny Occurs in Albanian Army, Threatening the Rear of Italian Troops

Athens - People here now believe that a mutiny has occurred in the Albanian army, which greatly helped the Greek troops' victory over the Italian troops in the area near Metsovo yesterday. Italian prisoners of war have also recounted the rout of the Italian troops when Albanian mutineers shot their officers with guns, and said that even though Italian military police fired machine guns to prevent the Italian troops from being disorganized, the entire line finally collapsed. Military observers also believe that if Greek troops continue to advance steadily, Santi Quaranta in southern Albania will soon be threatened. (United Press, 21st)

### Churchill Reviews the Mediterranean War Situation: Optimism in Both Theatres; British Armament Gradually Gaining An Advantage

London - Prime Minister Churchill reviewed the war situation in the Mediterranean in the House of Commons today, saying that there are two wars now underway there. One is the defense of Egypt and the Canal against an enemy with absolute superiority in numbers. This defense seemed quite difficult and uncertain a few months ago, but now we are deeply confident that if the enemy comes to attack, we will be able to inflict heavy losses on them. The other is Italy's invasion of Greece. Although the Greeks were completely unprepared, they have now almost completely cleared out the invading enemy. Such a feat is beyond description. We now have the above two theatres to consider. He can only say that we have done our best. The Prime Minister then mentioned that the law compensating those whose homes have been bombed will be passed during the opening of the new Parliament. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that so far, this war has been between a fully armed Germany and a British Empire armed to only a quarter or half of its capacity. The results we have achieved today are already quite good. He is confident that Britain will soon be able to gain an advantage in armament and achieve final victory. (Reuters, 21st)

### British Industrial Center Birmingham Heavily Bombed; Over 500 German Planes Participate; Germans Claim Over 500 Tons of Bombs Dropped

Berlin – A senior German military officer recently commented to a reporter from the Havas News Agency regarding German war reports, stating that Birmingham suffered greater losses from the German air raid last night than Coventry. Birmingham is a world-renowned hardware industrial center, the second largest city in Britain with a population of over one million. It houses blast furnaces, rolling mills, machine manufacturing plants, and automobile factories, some of which are engaged in the arms industry. In addition, there are textile factories and chemical plants. Britain’s largest engine manufacturing plant is also in Birmingham, having long ago been converted to manufacturing aircraft engines. The famous Morris Motor Company is also located there, along with other factories manufacturing machine guns, armored vehicles, and the like. German planes have subjected it to heavy bombing. The fires are more intense than those in Coventry, indicating that the area contains flammable materials (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 21st).

Berlin – On Tuesday night, Birmingham was subjected to a large-scale German air raid. Its munitions factories met the same fate as Coventry. According to details released by the responsible German authorities, over 500 German aircraft participated in the operation, dropping a variety of bombs, including over 500 tons of high-explosive bombs and thousands of incendiary bombs. Countless large and small fires broke out in the city. Although British anti-aircraft guns and searchlights were constantly in operation, they had little effect. The attack began with single-plane bombing, followed by large, concentrated bombing raids, rotating continuously until dawn yesterday. Various bombing techniques were used, including level flight, sudden low-altitude bombing, and dispersed bombing across the city or concentrated bombing in one area, confusing enemy anti-aircraft guns. A total of 500 German aircraft participated in the bombing, with only five missing (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 21st).

London – Last night and this morning, hundreds of German bombers, using high-explosive and incendiary bombs, shook the center of the British Midlands industrial area, taking a vicious revenge on two major centers of British wartime production. This new blitzkrieg spread death and destruction to an area not far from a major city in the Midlands, which was subjected to nine hours of intense bombing the previous night (the German High Command claims the city is Birmingham). Because the German air fleets flew across the coast and headed towards the central manufacturing areas, London was not heavily bombed last night. Until midnight, fewer than twenty bombs fell in the London area. However, several towns in southwestern and western England, as well as Wales, were attacked by German planes. A major city in the Midlands (whose name the British censor does not permit to be announced) and more than ten other towns in a neighboring large city were hit by thousands of bombs on Monday night. Rescue workers are still digging out buried people from the rubble this morning. The devastation in the area has been extensive, but just as one disaster passes, another arrives. The Midlands has suffered its most significant blow yet. One of the largest towns in the area was the main target of subsequent German air raids. German aircraft gathered over the town, circling until this morning. The losses sustained in last night’s attack are believed to be the greatest (International dispatch from the 21st).

London – Last night, German planes again visited a town near a city in the eastern Midlands, spreading death and destruction in a new blitzkrieg that lasted for nine hours. Shortly after nightfall, German planes began to fly over the east coast of England, dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs on the town like a torrential rain. During the first hour of the attack, explosions that shook the eardrums occurred every few seconds. The German attack provoked the most intense anti-aircraft fire in the area. Other German aircraft made diversionary raids on London and the southwestern and west-central regions of Wales. A major industrial city was also bombed last night. Hundreds of rescue workers are still working this morning, digging out bodies from the ruins (the censor does not permit the place name to be published, but the German High Command claims that the major city is Birmingham and that over one million pounds of high-explosive bombs and thousands of incendiary bombs were dropped) (International dispatch from the 21st).

London – A certain city in central England and a city on the south coast were shaken last night by German bombs and anti-aircraft fire. A certain town in central England was the focus of German air force bombing. From dusk until dawn, waves of German planes came, dropping high-explosive bombs, incendiary bombs, and "bread baskets" like rain. The beams of searchlights on the ground crisscrossed, and the anti-aircraft fire was extremely intense. According to eyewitnesses, this air battle was the most intense ever to occur in the area. London itself was largely quiet last night, as German planes had heavily bombed the Midlands for two consecutive nights. Also, during the air raid on a certain city on the south coast, high-explosive bombs landed in residential areas, one in a schoolyard and another on a road, destroying a gas main (United Press dispatch from the 21st).

### British Air Force Bombs Czech Armament Factory

London – The Air Ministry announced this morning that the British Air Force had bombed important military targets inside Germany and in German-controlled areas last night. The Skoda armaments factory in Czechoslovakia was subjected to a “most intense concentration” air raid lasting ten minutes. Simultaneously, British aircraft also attacked numerous important targets in Berlin, dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs for over an hour. During this terrible bombing, a factory manufacturing various equipment for the German Navy was damaged and caught fire (International dispatch from the 21st).

### Air Battle Occurs in Western Desert; Australian Air Force Participates for the First Time

London – Australian Air Force fighter planes recently engaged in air combat in the western desert of Africa for the first time and achieved a significant victory. According to the Aviation Ministry, four Australian Air Force Gladiator aircraft encountered a large formation of Italian fighters while returning from patrol yesterday. It is reported that five Fiat fighters were shot down and one Australian aircraft was lost, with one forced landing. The pilot was rescued. The South African British Air Force was also quite active yesterday, attacking the radio station and administrative office in Bardera, Italian Somaliland, twice, causing heavy damage. All returning British aircraft returned safely (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

The "Stampa" newspaper in Rome reported that Italian aircraft recently raided the Siwa Oasis in the desert with considerable success. The oasis is 260 kilometers from the coast and 50 kilometers from the Libyan Desert. British authorities have built defensive works and an airfield there to protect the southern flank of the Egyptian front. Siwa is 120 kilometers from the Italian-held Jaghbub Oasis in the desert. The Italian aircraft's attack caused panic among the defenders there because the land defenses were weak. The Italian aircraft were able to drop bombs on their targets without incident. Italian fighters then flew low and strafed British troops with machine guns, causing heavy losses (Havas dispatch from the 21st).

### German War Report

Berlin – This afternoon's German war report stated that since the beginning of the war, German torpedo boats have sunk enemy warships totaling no less than 11,300 tons, including six destroyers and two submarines. They have also sunk 212,000 tons of merchant shipping. The only loss of German torpedo boats was one that went missing yesterday. The torpedo boat had engaged in a fierce battle with several British destroyers off the east coast of England. Last night, German aircraft attacked port facilities in London, Birmingham, Weymouth, and Northampton, which were bombed. Last night, British aircraft attacked German airfields in western and northern France, but the Germans suffered no losses. The British aircraft's attack on western Germany was also unsuccessful. Only two German aircraft did not return to base yesterday (Havas dispatch from the 21st).

### British Air Vice-Marshal Boyd Captured by Italians

Rome – The Italian Supreme Command announced that British Air Vice-Marshal Boyd (Boyd Ewer Tudor) and seven others (including one major and three junior officers), flying in a Wellington bomber en route to Malta, were forced to land in Sicily and were all captured (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

London – The Air Ministry announced that Air Vice-Marshal Boyd is reported missing, but details are unknown. According to the British Air Force list, the name most closely resembling that of the Air Vice-Marshal captured by the Italian army is Air Vice-Marshal (now promoted to Air Marshal) Boyd, who was announced on Sunday as having been appointed Deputy Air Officer Commander-in-Chief, Middle East. It is reported that Boyd has already left for his new post in the Middle East. Boyd was formerly commander of the Balloon Command and was responsible for the barrage balloons in London (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

### Resettlement of People from Lorraine Temporarily Suspended; British "Times" Comments

Vichy – According to French semi-official sources, the French Ambassador to Occupied France, Mr. de Brinon, stated that the expulsion of French-speaking residents from the province of Lorraine will be temporarily suspended from today. This decision was the result of negotiations by the German Foreign Office representative in Paris (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

London – The "Times" commented on the German expulsion of French citizens from Alsace-Lorraine, saying that Hitler has repeatedly stated in the past five years that the return of the Saar region to Germany has settled the account with France, and the western border of Germany has been permanently decided. Even at the beginning of the war, Hitler still tried to entice France with sweet words to leave the Allied countries, making this solemn promise repeatedly. But now he has gone back on his word to benefit himself. Since the defeat of France, Germany's desire to recover its lost territory has become clear. Although the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine has not yet been formally approved by treaty, Germany no longer considers it a matter for discussion. Laval's policy of political appeasement towards Germany is the first result of this. According to various sources, anti-German sentiment has been spreading daily in France over the past few weeks, as nothing is more likely to enrage the French people. Vichy cabinet members who are not blinded by personal ambition like Laval must now realize that the only way to liberate France from oppression is through British victory. This realization is not only widespread among the currently helpless people of France, but also among the French in North Africa who have not yet decided to take the same action as Britain and Free France, and will soon do so (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

Vichy – After the German authorities in French Lorraine ordered the relocation of residents of French descent from the province starting on the 11th of this month, Paris officials recently announced that all of these residents could be relocated to the Free Zone of France by the 20th of this month (Havas dispatch from the 20th).

### British Embassy Holds Banquet

London – Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, held a banquet here yesterday. Guests included Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and his wife, as well as Admiral Chatfield and his wife (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

### Turkish Foreign Minister Receives British Ambassador; British Government to Purchase Grain from Turkey

Turkish Capital – Foreign Minister Saracoglu received British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen today for a long discussion. This matter is highly regarded by political figures, as Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin has been reciprocated, and Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Japan held a meeting in Vienna, with Hungary joining the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The war between Italy and Greece is also at a stalemate. Turkey is currently in a pivotal position. Therefore, this conversation is of great significance (Havas dispatch from the 21st).

Istanbul – It was learned here yesterday that in recent negotiations held in the Turkish capital between Britain and Turkey, Britain will purchase 600,000 pounds worth of grain from Turkey to supply British troops in the Near East. Britain now intends to pay in cash, which has greatly disappointed the Turkish government. Because Britain has been unable to transport goods to Turkey, the commercial agreement signed between Britain and Turkey, under which Turkey hoped Britain would supply the goods it lacks, can no longer become a reality (Havas dispatch from the 21st).

Hungarian Capital – According to an unconfirmed report arriving here today, the Turkish government is currently mobilizing 50,000 women to serve in auxiliary military roles (International dispatch from the 21st).

Turkish Capital – Rumors are rife here that the Turkish cabinet will be reorganized, but officials have not yet confirmed this news. According to well-informed sources, surprising events may occur in the next few days. Political figures are all awaiting the return of the German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen. It is generally believed that Papen will bring important proposals for adjusting German-Turkish relations (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

Swedish Capital – The Turkish cabinet held a special meeting last night, and President Ismet Inonu delivered a speech to a secret session of parliament. The content was kept secret (Havas dispatch from the 21st).

Ankara – At a special government-called meeting on Wednesday evening, members of the People's Party unanimously approved the government's plan to take new emergency measures to deal with the world situation. The nature of these new measures has not yet been announced (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

### British Ship Bombed in Gibraltar

Algeciras – According to reports from Spain, two aircraft of unknown nationality bombed British warships in Gibraltar yesterday. Thick smoke rose from the targeted warships on the spot (Havas dispatch from the 21st).

### Rumors of German Attempt to Establish a Flemish State; Belgian King May Meet with Hitler

London – Sources influenced by the Germans are spreading rumors that it has been suggested to establish a Flemish state from southern Holland and the Flemish provinces of Belgium and France. At the same time, it is said that King Leopold of Belgium has met with or will meet with Hitler. This statement clearly aims to create the impression that the Belgian king is now moving towards the Axis camp and becoming a player in the new Flemish state. However, considering the Belgian king's attitude since becoming a prisoner, all discerning observers, whether British or Belgian, do not believe that his meeting with Hitler is true. Therefore, we treat this news with caution. The Germans encouraged a similar plan during the last war, and now they are repeating the old trick. Unless unexpected events occur, it will undoubtedly fail again. Flemings, except for the part controlled by the Germans, are absolutely loyal to Belgium, and the plan to create a Flemish state would inevitably move the French-speaking Walloons of southern Belgium to France, which would cause a great uproar that the German secret police could not suppress (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

### British Parliament Closed Yesterday

London – Parliament closed today. King George VI, in naval uniform, personally attended the House of Commons and read a speech in a firm voice to the crowded audience, expressing Britain's determination to continue the war until freedom is guaranteed and final victory is achieved. This speech was read on behalf of the King by the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords. The two Houses were then adjourned (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

### Earthquake Occurs in Japanese-Controlled Kuril Islands; Southern Carpathians Also Experience Earthquake

Moscow – According to a report from the Central Seismological Station, at 6:12:46 AM on November 19th, an earthquake occurred 7,250 kilometers from Moscow. The epicenter was near the Kuril Islands (north of Hokkaido). Also, at 11:30:25 AM on the same day, an earthquake occurred 1,250 kilometers from Moscow. The epicenter was in the southern Carpathian Mountains, not far from the location of the earthquake on November 10th (TASS dispatch from the 21st).

### Reasons for Stagnation of Egyptian War; Italian Dr. Caloni Admits British Defensive Advantage

Rome – Dr. Caloni, a senior official of the Italian Ministry of African Affairs, explained to foreign reporters yesterday the reasons why the Italian army's recent two-month offensive in Egypt had stalled. He stated that water is the most important thing in the war in that area. The Italian army needs 500 barrels of water daily, which are transported from Cyrenaica to the front line, requiring a three-day journey. Between Benghazi and Sidi Barrani, a thousand light motorcycles travel back and forth every day, transporting water, food, livestock feed, and military fuel. Road construction also takes time. For example, the construction of the road from Sollum to Sidi Barrani required 150,000 motorcycle trips to transport the necessary materials, covering a distance of 30 kilometers. The Italian army now has thousands of soldiers who have laid down their weapons to engage in road construction work, which is very difficult. The temperature is often above 40 degrees Celsius, and there are occasional winds, flying sand, and blowing stones, obscuring the eyes, ears, mouths, and noses with dust and sand. The British army does not have these difficulties, as the Egyptian resources supply their needs. The water of the Nile River is also piped by the British army from Alexandria to the front line. British Commander General Wavell is a brilliant military strategist and has a large number of troops familiar with desert warfare under his command (Havas dispatch from the 21st).

### British House of Commons Debates Indian Question

London – The Secretary of State for India, Leo Amery, expressed his gratitude last night during the House of Commons debate on the Indian question for India's generous contribution to the British war effort. He stated that 60,000 Indian soldiers are currently serving overseas in the British Army. India has also shipped 100 million rounds of ammunition, 400,000 artillery shells, 100 million jute bags, 1 million pairs of leather boots, and 30,000 tents overseas. Broadly speaking, India's goal is to work with the dominions and colonies east of the Suez Canal to supply all the needs of the British forces in the Middle East and Far East. India is also training skilled workers. In the coming months, another 10,000 skilled workers will be added. Britain will send instructors to India again, and young Indian workers will also be transported to Britain to work with British workers, so they may become familiar with the latest methods and the spirit expressed by the British wartime industrial organization. Although Indian leaders have different opinions, they all know that the failure of the British Empire and the victory of the dictatorships would make India unable to defend itself against inevitable aggression by sea, land, and air (Reuters dispatch from the 21st).

### U.S. Secretary of the Navy Denies Interception of Foreign Ships

Washington – U.S. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox denied yesterday that U.S. warships had intercepted and searched foreign merchant ships in the Gulf of Mexico. He said, "It is regrettable that the patrol of U.S. warships at sea has been twisted into a false report for malicious propaganda." It is believed that this report originated from recent rumors that the four German ships that broke out of the port of Tampico were encountered by U.S. warships, not British warships (United Press dispatch from the 21st).

### Dutch East Indies Refuses to Release Detained German Nationals

Washington – The Dutch Embassy in the United States stated yesterday that Germany had requested the release of detained Germans and their families in the Dutch East Indies, but the Dutch had not complied with the request (Havas dispatch from the 21st).

### American-Born Chinese Youth, Zhang Yuan Cheng, Enlists in Military Service

New York – American-born Chinese youth, Zhang Yuan Cheng (transliteration), who had previously drawn the first lot in the first district of the conscription committee, was yesterday assigned to serve in the U.S. Army Special Battalion in New York City. On the list of the Special Battalion released yesterday, there were a total of 1,917 people, and Zhang's name topped the list. It is reported that this American-born Chinese youth, although he had been drafted, had voluntarily enlisted beforehand, so he cannot be regarded as being conscripted. If Zhang's physique can pass the military doctor's examination, he will become the first person sent to Fort Dix (United Press dispatch from the 21st).

### Grain; Foreign Rice囤积 Not Questioning Spot or Futures; Over 20,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived in Port Yesterday;囤户 Still Actively Hoping to Obtain a Large Profit

Large quantities of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The French Company's “Kim Dinh”轮, coming directly from Saigon, loaded 14,200+ bags. It was supposed to arrive on Saturday, but because of bad weather the previous day, navigation was difficult and it could not reach Shanghai on time. It is now known to have entered port yesterday morning, berthing at the Shun Tai Wharf in Hongkou to unload. In addition, the Taikoo Company’s “Jinan” 轮 arrived yesterday morning, carrying 7,153 bags from Hong Kong, and the “Yue Zhou” 轮 also transported 5,435 bags from Hong Kong, arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The “Jinan” 轮 berthed at the Bund in the French Concession, and the “Yue Zhou” 轮 berthed at the 本行码头 in Pudong, separately unloading (祖).

Foreign rice continued to rise yesterday. Not only were 回笼 futures favored by 囤户, but spot foreign rice also caught the attention of 囤户. Trading was unusually brisk throughout the day. Although the source was continuous and the inventory was increasing, people's hearts were increasingly agitated. Speculative囤户 strongly promoted in the market that prices in the production area were rising, orders were scarce, ships were decreasing, and transportation was difficult. Therefore, the purchasing power of floating散戶 both inside and outside the industry was also strong. Both spot and futures rice soared consistently after the market opened in the morning. In the early market, spot rice had already increased by 1.35 yuan, and Pagoda Brand No. 2 Saigon broke through the 70 yuan mark, shouting 71 yuan. Later, there were floating households and large households taking profits, and the market once fell back by 35 cents. However, after the market opened in the afternoon, it rose again by 67 cents due to active 囤 buying. After the price increased, the price of floating households returning to the market fell slightly by 34 cents. As a result, it still rose by 1 yuan and 1.5 yuan compared to the previous night. Futures rose by about 1 yuan in the morning and then rose again by 34 cents in the afternoon. The result was also 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon November reached 86 yuan, December 84.5 yuan, No. 2 spot in the morning 83.5 yuan, afternoon 84 yuan, November in the morning 83 yuan, afternoon 83.3 yuan, December in the morning 81.5 yuan, afternoon 81.78 yuan, Small绞 morning 79.5 yuan, afternoon 80 yuan, both entry and exit were active, and the total turnover for the day was still around 1,000 tons. A new 囤 consult was completed for 15,000 bags of spot foreign rice.

New 粳尖 and 野稻菉种, etc., arrived in a total of 1,000+ 石. Regarding sales, because foreign rice was soaring and people’s hearts were favorable, stores were very畅, so all prices increased by 1 yuan. Opening new 粳原包 92 yuan 89 yuan, 特丸 13 yuan, 斛见 88 yuan, 86 yuan, 茶　斛见 812 yuan, 野稻斛见 89 yuan, 杜尖斛见 78 yuan, 羊尖斛 77 yuan.

Although glutinous rice’s path is not as wide as other goods, because arrivals are small and continuous, and the inventory is relatively thin, the cargo owners all think of raising prices, so the selling price is also very upright and beautiful. Opening Yili白元 84.5 yuan, 80.6 yuan, second 83 yuan, Hong Kong 白元 78.5 yuan to 75 yuan

### Flour Sales in North China Develop; 7,600 Tons of Australian Wheat Arrive in Shanghai

The flour market is still stable. Although the price of the 二号粉厂 has not changed, all factories ultimately have reduced production and cannot fully supply. And it is heard that recently Northern China Qingdao etc., have gradually取 from 本洋粉.

The wheat market does not break away from the situation of quiet firmness. This is because the supply from the interior has been rare for a long time. Although there are brokers　售贩运, there have been no whole batch arrivals in port. It is heard that the Japanese factory　胃 is slightly more greedy than before, and it has also抛进 120,000 bags of futures to grain merchants, and the price has been放至 27 yuan. The inventory in the concession needs 28 yuan, and 2300 bags are also 收进 by the Chinese factory, and the market is quite firm.

### Gold Market Lacks Vitality

Yesterday's current account raw gold unofficial market, continued the former trend of being firm and unchanged. Transactions were still not active, speculation had dissipated, and only ordinary buying and selling occurred. In the morning, prices briefly rose to a high of 5,715 yuan, but the increase was small. Sellers inevitably appeared at the higher prices, causing prices to consistently fluctuate between 5,770 and 5,790 yuan. The late closing was 3 yuan lower than the previous day, at 5,680 yuan. Total daily transactions were only over 2,000 taels. Gold jewelry remained unchanged, and customs gold was flat.

Raw Gold Fluctuation Limited

The morning opening was very flat, with gold shops offering 20 taels at 5,682 yuan. Both gold and silver shops intended to match each other, adding some interest. The price was pulled out to 700 yuan outside the customs, with gold shops taking 30 taels from silver shops at 5,715 yuan. After several rounds of fluctuation, meeting resistance from money changers, the upward momentum was blocked, and the price returned to 700 yuan inside the customs, with money changers taking 20 taels from gold shops at 5,685 yuan. Subsequently, hearing that the foreign exchange market was quite flat, retail investors and certain silver shops bought slightly, closing at a high of 5,694 yuan, with silver shops matching 30 taels at this price. In the afternoon, fluctuations continued, with alternating rises and falls. Initially, silver shops took 10 taels from gold shops at 5,690 yuan. At that time, rumors of peace arose, weakening the bullish sentiment, and sellers emerged. Silver shops helped to sell, decreasing the price by 20 yuan, with silver shops matching 20 taels at 5,670 yuan. Later, money changers bought, raising the price back to 5,680 yuan. As a result, gold shops matched 30 taels at 5,680 yuan, which was the late closing price. The price fluctuated by 35 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of current gold by the gold shops was more than ten yuan higher than raw gold, and the buying price was thirty yuan lower. The current price of standard gold was fifty to sixty yuan lower than the listed gold, with few transactions taking place.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Still Rising, Unified B Again Reaches New High, Category C Exceeds Three Yuan

In the unofficial securities market, the rising trend gradually strengthened yesterday. Category B reached a new high price of 66 yuan and 1 jiao, Category A approached three yuan, and Category C also surpassed the three yuan mark, showing a brisk trend. Another upward trend is about to be triggered for the third time recently. The market demand is very strong, with only Xinfu and Shengda absorbing 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan, undoubtedly due to strong backing. Observing the previous days, overseas Chinese also absorbed 1.1 to 1.2 million yuan. The chips are becoming tighter and tighter. Those outside the industry who are buying are hoarding, and will not release them anytime soon. Furthermore, there are proposed new loans of 200 million US dollars from the United States. At the same time, a peaceful atmosphere is still brewing, all of which are strong factors for the dramatic rise in public bonds. Yesterday's transactions saw Xinfu buying around 300,000 yuan of Category C in the morning, and Renchang, Tongji, and Hongda buying Category E. Others such as Hengfu, Tongshun, Yuzhong, Xie Kang, and Yitai also had demand. Shuntai and Lemao sold approximately hundreds of thousands of Category C, but failed to suppress the market price. Datong, Dunyu, Lianhe, and Tiansheng also closed positions, but the demand still exceeded the supply. Category B reached a new high price, and the trend suddenly changed because of this. In the afternoon, Xinfu's absorption became even stronger, and Shengda's short covering was also close to 500,000 yuan. Others, such as Tongshun, Tongkang, Yichang, Lianhe, Yitai, and Lemao, also realized that it was no longer a time to short sell. Xie Kang was the largest supplier in the market, at approximately 300,000 yuan. Yuzhong and Dingkang also had 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Others, such as Yongkang, Jiufeng, Shunheng, and general retail investors, were still selling to meet the demand. Categories A and B reached new high prices again. At the moment, only Category D is relatively stable, and it is feared that it will soon be noticed. As a result, market prices rose across the board, from 4 or 5 jiao to 6 jiao and a half. In addition, 30,000 yuan of long-term financial bonds were traded at 61 yuan. The total transaction amount was approximately 2.6 to 2.7 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Transactions, Transactions, Yong'an Spinning Factory shares: 30 shares, priced at 154 yuan.

The opening of public industry stocks was slightly sluggish due to the severe drop in New York. Then, the trend turned firm. There was no major change throughout the day. At one point, the bulls emerged, but the price drop was limited. The stocks with the most active trading during the week all had short covering activity. Steel stocks had the most vibrant movement, with a rise of one yuan and a half. Jardine Breweries also rebounded strongly, with the closing price at seven yuan and five fen.

London, 20th (Wednesday) - The listed market prices of Chinese public bonds and Far East British merchant company stocks remained flat. Only HSBC Bank's London-registered shares rebounded slightly by half a pound, to a price of sixty-five and a half pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares were unchanged. There were no other changes.

British United Shipyards Profit

British United Shipyards Limited intends to pay a final dividend of two yuan per share for the year ending September this year, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the company's net profit for this session reached over 4.4 million national currency, and combined with the accumulated profit from the previous session, the total was over 4.6 million yuan. After paying interim and final dividends totaling 3.375 million yuan, and setting aside 1 million yuan for the public reserve, the remaining 234,000 yuan was carried forward to the next session.

### Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales Slightly Reduced, Yarn Prices Fall

Yesterday's yarn market, which had rebounded the previous day, returned to a sluggish state. This was due to a decrease in spot yarn transactions. At the same time, general retail investors were mostly bearish, and their intention to sell was not yet extinguished. Therefore, there was considerable pressure on the market. However, the inventory reports from various warehouses in the middle of last week showed a decrease, and the export volume was still not bad. Therefore, large firms were absorbing the amount without any change. Some also said that the current situation is weak, and if prices fall, it would be more appropriate to buy. Today, 75 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Spot Yarn: The morning opening was peaceful because reports of peace negotiations completely faded away, and market sentiment was still moderate. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,239 yuan, rising slightly to 1,242 yuan. Subsequently, due to the calmness of foreign exchange, there was no change in silk. As a result, the market fluctuated between 1,237 and 1,241 yuan for two hours. However, actual business was not as active as the previous day. Those who were eager to cover their short positions were very active. Suddenly, the price fell to 1,233 yuan, but there was buying to cover, pushing it up again. Eventually, there were more sellers, and the price continued to fall to 1,230 yuan at the close. The mid-day transaction statistics showed 4,220 bales, with the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn falling by 10 yuan. The amount bought by the various factions is listed below:

Hong Kong: 600, Peers: 4,000

Ningbo: 20, Total: 4,220

Cotton Market Dull

The current cotton situation is still quiet. As the supply has not been very active, market sentiment is still stable. However, the mills' attitude is calm, so there is also a lack of development capacity in transactions.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market showed weakness from the beginning of the morning. Later, due to the closing of some long positions and the fall in stock prices on Wall Street, the closing price was 14 to 15 points lower than the previous day. India has stopped trading for three days. Yesterday's closing price rose by more than two rupees.

The trading of imported cotton in Shanghai has been particularly dull in recent days. Mills are somewhat considering purchasing Brazilian cotton, but the price needs to be low. Therefore, not many transactions have been made. The general expectation is that the cotton market will change at the beginning of the month.

### Piece Goods: Spring Poplin - Factories Already Opening

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was stable, with sales offerings varying. Hoarders are observing, and actual sales transactions are still frequent. Some white goods, both coarse and fine cloth, fell by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half. Twill is average.

Cantonese and Hong Kong firms traded more than 300 pieces of bleached cloth and colored cloth. Zhejiang and Fujian firms traded more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill bleached cloth. Firms on the Northern Road in Yantai traded more than 100 pieces of heavy coarse cloth. Today, 82 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: Because Japanese yarn fell yesterday, market sentiment was soft. The morning opening for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 35 yuan and 5 jiao. Transactions were slow. The afternoon closing was 35 yuan and 3 jiao. Four Gentlemen serge was around 1 yuan and 8 fen. However, sales of various mid-range brands of fine cloth and dyed cloth in Muji Street were still good, with only a drop of 1 or 2 jiao per piece.

### Oil Market: Raw Oil Rising Again, Going Long

Yesterday's soybean oil market was stable. Peanut oil saw frequent buying at low prices due to bullish sentiment. Transactions in both spot and futures oils rose across the board by more than one yuan. A total of 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 76 yuan. 300 dan of Dayouyu Factory oil was traded at 84 yuan and 5 jiao. 400 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at 76 yuan and 7 jiao and a half to 77 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. 200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded at 106 yuan and 2 jiao and a half to 106 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. 50 barrels were ordered for delivery in November at 106 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices See Mixed Fluctuations

The price of Dutch raw sugar slightly fell, to 56 yuan. The price for orders placed by the 30th of this month was still 56 yuan and 2 jiao. The initial price of Tai Gu Che White B-mark sugar from West warehouses was 74 yuan and 6 jiao, but then returned to 74 yuan and 8 jiao. The price from East warehouses was 74 yuan and 4 jiao. Lower-grade DY-mark and HX-mark sugar were firmer, rebounding by 1 or 2 jiao. The price from East warehouses was 69 yuan and 2 jiao. Dutch cotton white sugar was firm, with RA-mark sugar at 75 yuan and 2 jiao and RS-mark sugar at 70 yuan and a half.

### North-South Goods: Anhui Honey Dates - Market Price Nearly Doubles

Honey dates, such as those from Jiaxing and Suzhou, had fallen from 140-150 yuan to 120+ yuan. Now these goods are out of stock. The product from Huizhou, known for its highest quality, had limited shipments until recently due to transportation difficulties. Therefore, the value is quite high, almost doubled. Huizhou (worker's) grade now sells for 240 yuan.

Metals: HSBC Iron Stable

HSBC iron transactions are still relatively frequent because the market is not stagnant for local can factories, printing factories, and toy factories. Therefore, the opening prices remain stable. For example, 200-pound old steel factory goods sell for 175 yuan per box, and new steel factory goods sell for 165 yuan. Plain white iron is still expensive, such as seven-foot nails requiring nine yuan, and six-foot nails selling for eight yuan. However, Yuan Ding made nails are declining, because Nan Yang firms still have few routes and Northern ocean firms have not started moving sales, only relying on local small hardware and scattered transactions. The market has seen a decline, currently 53 yuan per barrel.

### Medicinal Materials: Shaanxi-Gansu Licorice Actively Being Sold

Shaanxi licorice, at the beginning of this month, had a once-upon-a-time, rebound-loosened, sales of 165 yuan, now that the stomach-seeking rotation is alive, prices will rise, yesterday the market rose by ten yuan, selling 175 yuan, the trend feels quite outstanding,

### Mid-Winter Season's Woolen Goods Business　Shi Sheng　Overcoat Wool is Particularly Scarce and Expensive　Blue and Green Colors are Most Popular　Local Products Rising Stars

The busiest time for woolen goods sales is in the autumn, as autumn leads into the winter business. Over half of the annual turnover is done in the autumn, hence the excitement. Looking at the summer goods market before this autumn, it has been exceptionally good. In previous years, funds were not tied up, but now they are as expensive as autumn and winter goods (roughly, one yard costs what one and three yards could be sold for in the same period two years ago). The main reason for the soaring prices is the drastic change in foreign exchange rates since May 2nd, coupled with the prolonged and expanded European war, leading to shortages. Consequently, the prices of various autumn and winter woolen goods have risen even more sharply. Tweed at thirty to fifty yuan per yard and overcoat wool at one hundred yuan per yard have become commonplace. Looking at the prices of various goods listed below, the difference in wholesale prices between just one year apart is like heaven and earth, which shows the strength of the price increases.

October 1st, Year 28

October 1st, Year 29

Yongfeng Single-Sided High Stripe Tweed　7.25　19.00

British-Made Three Camel Brand Sea Dragon　27.00　56.00

Zhanghua 918 Plain Serge　4.50　2.50

Wei Yi Deer Wide Tight Camel Wool　2.40　5.50

Currently, at the end of autumn and beginning of winter, the daily sales volume of woolen goods is especially high, especially for overcoat wool, which is extremely scarce in the market and very popular. Both buyers and sellers regard it as a treasure. The expensiveness of the selling price can be said to have reached its peak. Looking at the facts, everyone in the industry says it is expensive, but sales are still quite enthusiastic. Observing the intentions of Chinese and Western suit customers, those who buy cloth and tailor overcoats, although they say the price is expensive and they have no money to add to it, their orders for Western suits and buying of woolen goods are still not declining. This is because woolen goods are durable and suitable for weddings and funerals, regardless of quality. Moreover, the price of silk and cloth has also soared.

Looking at the current peak sales season for autumn and winter woolen goods, blue and green colors are equally popular for woolen goods such as thick and thin, shiny and matte pattern tweed, serges, board wool, etc., for both men's and women's clothing. Cheongsam wool is especially popular. Mohair, Sea Dragon, and men's and women's overcoats are still popular throughout Shanghai. Interlined camel-hair overcoats are more popular than riding breeches wool. In fact, 70-80% of sales rely on the isolated island corner of this street. Furthermore, at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, there was a trend among industry insiders and outsiders to stockpile autumn and winter woolen goods, hoping to monopolize them for huge profits. However, the reality was difficult to predict. Imported goods gradually arrived, and there was only a temporary shortage of raw materials for one month, after which imports continued to flow in. Local woolen goods production was sufficient, and the market trended weaker, with prices falling steadily. Those who hoarded goods all suffered losses. Although recent actual sales are not weak, they are still one-third lower than last year. People feel slightly more at ease, but most of the previously stockpiled goods coming onto the market still have no profit to be made. Therefore, woolen goods transactions have now largely returned to normal, and hoarding transactions have completely stopped.

### American Navy Secretary Expresses　No Withdrawal of Shanghai Garrison　US-Japan War Unlikely to Break Out Temporarily　Aiding China Means Containing Japan

Washington, November 21st, United Press: US Secretary of the Navy Knox announced yesterday at a press conference that the US government has no plans to withdraw the US Marine 4th Regiment stationed in Shanghai.

American Attitude Will Be More Firm　A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired yesterday with an American political science professor at a local university about future developments and whether American expatriates should continue to withdraw. According to the professor, the issue of withdrawing expatriates is a result of the US government's decision to adopt a firm attitude and protect its interests in the Far East. If the US continues to aid China and expands the embargo, Japan may retaliate, applying the same treatment to American expatriates that it has applied to British expatriates. Furthermore, if American expatriates are treated the same as expatriates, the US government will definitely take a stronger stance than the British. The situation is serious and unavoidable. Therefore, it is advisable for American expatriates to withdraw as soon as possible. Even at this school, nine female professors are preparing to return home. Among them, four also took their children on the Washington ship the day before yesterday. Although male professors remain, if the situation becomes urgent and leaving China is better than staying, they should also buy a boat and say goodbye.

Japan Finds it Difficult to Wage War Against the US　The reporter then asked if a US-Japan war could break out at present. The professor replied that war would not break out immediately. First, although the attitude of the American public is very strong, they do not want war. The government, on the other hand, attaches greater importance to the situation in Europe and its interests in the Atlantic. It will take a defensive posture in the Pacific. Second, Japan also does not want to start a war, but it will still try its best to obtain raw materials for domestic use and for the Sino-Japanese War. Today, it seems impossible for Japan to draw troops to fight against the US's main forces before the war in China is over. Therefore, one side has already assessed the situation and retreated knowing the difficulty, while the other side is temporarily taking a defensive posture, so a direct conflict is unlikely to occur.

Actively Supporting China and Strengthening Strength　However, although the US government is not determined to engage in a two-ocean war at present, in order to maintain its interests in the Far East, it will actively support China to support China's war effort and contain Japan, and its attitude towards Japan will be even stronger. Because the public is preparing to support the government, although a US-Japan war is unlikely to break out at present, the possibility is still very high. Furthermore, during the US's expanded embargo process, the Japanese warlords will take further steps of resistance. If our predictions are not wrong, then when the two countries come face to face, the Pacific Ocean will be filled with gunfire.

### Aviation Festival　Shanghai People Encouraged　Voluntary Donations　Not Forgetting the Air Force's Achievements in the Battle of Shanghai　Silent Remembrance for Martyred Soldiers

Yesterday (the 21st) was the first National Air Defense Day. Celebrations and air defense exhibitions were held enthusiastically throughout the country, and condolences and relief were given to compatriots affected by air raids, promoting air defense donations and strengthening air defense equipment. Due to the special environment, this port did not hold any commemorative ceremonies. However, the public, in view of the Air Force's repeated achievements over the past three years, which have been greatly commendable, and the Air Force's deployment in the Battle of Shanghai, which gave Shanghai people an encouraging impression, spontaneously donated air defense funds to strengthen the country's air defense equipment. In addition to the 800 Soldiers Camp of the Lone Army donating 1,791 yuan to respond to the plane donation movement, donations from all walks of life were also very enthusiastic. Furthermore, to mourn the martyred soldiers in air battles across the country and the compatriots affected by air raids, everyone observed a moment of silence yesterday to express their condolences.

### Salvation Army Leader Broadcasts on Relief Issues, Listing General Works Urgently Requiring Rescue, Rebuilding Life and Character as a Noble Duty

Salvation Army leader for this city, Brigadier Morris, delivered a radio address at 9:30 PM yesterday evening via the French Radio Station, explaining the general winter relief issues in Shanghai, especially the issue of accommodating beggars. Morris first stated that there are countless social problems in Shanghai that urgently need to be solved or adjusted. Citizens suffering from hunger, cold, and homelessness are everywhere. For example, in a certain month this winter, 506 poor people froze to death on the streets in one night. The total number of deaths from freezing and starvation since the beginning of winter has already exceeded the number of deaths in the Romanian earthquake. This situation cannot be ignored. In my opinion, Shanghai is indeed becoming the most enlightened city in the world, but because the evils of all nations converge here, it is also the darkest city at the same time. Now, I will list the various social problems that urgently need attention:

Accommodating Beggars: This matter is perhaps the most urgent problem in this city. Fortunately, the authorities of the Public Concession's Municipal Council attach great importance to this. The plan to open a beggar shelter has now become a reality. According to our plan, in addition to providing beggars with food, clothing, and shelter, we will also teach young beggars livelihood skills. Those addicted to drugs or suffering from illness will also be treated. In addition, all the work in the shelter will be done by the beggars themselves. In addition to work, exercise, and adequate food, we will also purchase religious texts for them, but without forcing them. On the French Concession side, the French authorities are also strongly supporting this work. In total, no less than 2,500 drug-addicted beggars in the French Concession's shelters have already broken their bad habits. Major Fabre, the Chief of the French Concession Police, and the various authorities of the Health Department have made the greatest efforts in this regard, which is truly admirable.

Rescuing Prostitutes is an Urgent Matter

This is also one of the major problems in this city. Shanghai prostitutes often openly solicit customers in the streets. Although solving this problem may cause some difficulties, we cannot abandon it and sit idly by.

Improving Housing is Difficult to Implement Temporarily: Shanghai residents often live with four families in one room, eating, sleeping, and even living and dying there. Since the outbreak of the war, this overcrowded situation has become even worse. Efforts should be made to remedy this. This situation can only be improved after peace is restored in the future.

Foreign Paupers are in Dire Straits: This matter can be illustrated with an example. It has been heard that a certain family of foreign refugees, with parents and children totaling eleven people, arrived in Shanghai penniless and unable to find lodging. Moreover, they had no relatives and were not recognized by any consulate. Two days later, the father died of exhaustion. His wife was left to care for nine children. The Salvation Army immediately provided relief, maintaining their livelihood for thirteen months. In addition, the situation of most White Russians is also extremely difficult. However, after efforts to provide relief, their situation will undoubtedly be greatly improved.

European Refugees Should Also Be Helped: Since the outbreak of the European War, countless people in various countries have been displaced. Although the Salvation Army cannot solely bear the responsibility for relief, it must do its best to provide assistance.

Poor Strata Urgently Need Assistance: There is also a type of poor people who, although not living in refugee shelters, live in reed sheds or villages and are in dire straits. The employment situation in this city is extremely sluggish. Most factories have either closed down or laid off some employees. The majority of these workers are trapped in misery because of this, with little hope for the future. In this situation, the relief and repatriation of refugees, the relief of rickshaw pullers, prisoners, and the children of coolies are the most pressing tasks for the Salvation Army.

Donating Cotton Clothing is Reliant on All Sectors: The soup kitchen program implemented last winter used trucks to deliver hot meals to refugees. Since its implementation, it has benefited thousands of hungry people and is immeasurably meritorious. It is hoped that with the establishment of beggar shelters, this program will no longer be necessary this winter. In short, rebuilding life and character is the noblest aspiration of every human group. It is deeply hoped that all sectors will be inspired to donate various items, especially cotton clothing, this winter, to help the Salvation Army solve the difficulties of millions of hungry people.

### Construction Trading Company Searched by Japanese, Important Personnel Arrested

The Times reports that the Construction Trading Company in Room 832, Liu Hongji Building, 33 Sichuan Road, was searched by Japanese military police yesterday because the Japanese side claimed that the place was an agency purchasing railway construction materials for Chongqing. Several important personnel of the company were arrested, including Gao Zuxian (transliteration), who once served as an engineer for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and Mr. Lei Baoping. According to the Japanese, the company purchased 400,000 yuan worth of materials last year and sent them to Yushan. From January to July this year, it purchased a total of 200,000 yuan worth of goods, all of which were transported from Ningbo to the Yushan General Office via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Last month, Japanese military police searched the residence of Construction Trading Company personnel on Beile Road in the French Concession, but all the personnel were not at home.

### American Community in Shanghai Celebrates Thanksgiving Yesterday, Special Service Simple and Moving, Bishop Ward Addresses Defending Freedom

The American community in Shanghai went to the Grand Church on Jiangxi Road yesterday morning (the 21st) to participate in the annual Thanksgiving service. By 10:45, the church was already very crowded. By the time the service officially began at 11:00, there were no seats left, and Americans continued to enter the church in a steady stream. The Thanksgiving service was presided over by American Consul General Lockhead and Pastor Kohai, and it was simple and moving. American Judge Hellmich delivered a Thanksgiving speech, stating that today is the Thanksgiving Day for the American people. The whole world is now in chaos, but the American people still have many achievements, and they should thank the Lord for giving them the strength to achieve this grace. America is prosperous, society is progressing, material resources are developing, and there is no end to it. The people are deeply patriotic, and the military is well-equipped and fearless. The world war began in China and is actually a war to defend autonomy and freedom. Initially, the United States seemed to be taking a spectator's position, but the spirit of freedom depends on implementation; otherwise, freedom will become empty words. Today, the United States should share a responsibility to promote the realization of freedom. The funds raised during the service will all be handed over to the American Civilian Relief Association.

### Legal Tender Credit Further Strengthened

The English Finance and Commerce News states that the difference between forward and spot exchange rates has been minimal recently, which proves that legal tender has become increasingly stable. Therefore, most speculators believe that the legal tender exchange rate will continue to rise. At the same time, although the sound of peace in the Far East is constantly spreading, it is difficult to imagine a peaceful resolution to the Sino-Japanese dispute under the current circumstances. In addition, the crisis of the Western War is also sufficient to keep the legal tender exchange rate strong, because those who hold foreign exchange will sell more of it. In addition, the Tokyo political circles are increasingly worried about the general political situation in Japan. According to recent telegrams, Japan will amend the banknote issuance law to strengthen the currency system. According to Suzuki, the governor of the Bank of Japan, Japan's cash reserves are decreasing day by day, while the use of cash reserves is increasing due to the evolution of the world situation and international payments. Under these circumstances, all parties are requesting that a portion of the cash reserves be transferred to foreign exchange accounts. According to Mr. Ramon, an American banker who understands the Japanese economic situation, speaking in New York, most of Japan's funds have been consumed, taxes have increased, and gold has decreased. The Japanese economy has reached the road to collapse. The Tripartite Pact is of no benefit to Japan. The Japanese should understand the weakness of their own economic power and urgently need to change course.

### Catholics Hold Regular Prayers, Bishop Heuis Has Issued Invitations

Catholics in this city, in accordance with the order of Pope Pius XII, will hold a grand prayer meeting on Sunday (the 24th) to pray to God for the restoration of world peace, order, and true and just peace. Bishop Heuis has issued invitations to Catholics in this city, stating that special ceremonies will be held in various Catholic churches on that day, so that all Catholics will participate and unite with fellow believers around the world to pray together.

### American Citizens Will Continue to Withdraw One After Another, Subscription for Postal Steamer Cabins Enthusiastic, Many Church Women and Children Also Leaving Shanghai

The last American refugee evacuation vessel, the USS Washington, sent by the US government, is now on its way to Manila to return to the United States. Americans remaining in Shanghai who intend to withdraw are subscribing to tickets for the US steamers President Cleveland (departing Shanghai on December 9) and President Coolidge (departing Shanghai on December 31). The US State Department recommended that after non-essential American citizens leave China, it sent three special ships. The first ship, the President Monde, set sail from Shanghai with 325 people on board, taking the route through Manila and Australia back to the United States. The second ship, the Mariposa, left Shanghai on November 12 with 85 people on board, heading to North China, Korea, and Japan to return to the United States. The third ship, the Washington, sailed out the day before yesterday (the 20th) with 436 people on board. The total number of American citizens evacuated from Shanghai on these three ships is 846. However, the number of Americans evacuated is not limited to this number. In the coming months, scheduled steamships arriving in Shanghai will also carry ordinary passengers and many "non-essential" American citizens leaving Shanghai back to their countries. According to church sources, many missionaries' families have already left Shanghai. Only about 50 male clergy have been evacuated so far. By February 1 next year, the number of people evacuated from the church may reach 900 to 1,000, with women and children accounting for the majority, and men accounting for a smaller proportion. If the situation becomes more dangerous, the number of evacuees will naturally increase.

### Rumors Abound in the Rice Market, Market Conditions Chaotic, Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai Again

Yesterday, the rice market spread rumors that the situation in Saigon was becoming increasingly tense, and that war might break out at any moment. British ships will be completely requisitioned, and the source of foreign rice will be cut off at that time, and there may be a possibility of banning rice exports locally, so that the market was upward, and the market conditions tended to be chaotic. Prices of rice in various stalls continued to rise. General stable rice merchants, in view of the rice market repeatedly creating rumors, have been refuted by facts, this time is the same, but the reputation of the rice industry, has been destroyed by such people, are sighing.

Large Quantities of Foreign Rice and Wheat Arrive in Shanghai, Vietnamese and Siamese foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, as repeatedly reported in the commercial news column of this newspaper. Yesterday, a large quantity of foreign rice arrived in port. The Taikoo Company's Jinan ship brought 7,153 bags from Hong Kong, the Yuezhou ship brought 4,435 bags from Hong Kong, and the French Company's Kimdia ship, directly from Saigon, brought more than 14,200 bags, also arriving at the Shun Tai Wharf in Hongkou and berthing there yesterday morning. The ships are unloading separately. Another British ship, the Leana, brought 7,600 tons of foreign wheat from Australia, totaling more than 76,000 bags, and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 20th) morning and is now unloading. The ship is managed by the Gao Fu Rui Shipping Company in this city. As for the foreign rice from Vietnam and Siam, it can be continuously supplied, and there is no risk of interruption.

### Japanese Warships Shell Eastern Zhejiang

According to reliable information from the shipping industry, at 9:10 AM on the 20th, heavy artillery fire was heard northwest of Zhenhai Port. The sounds were like a string of pearls, totaling more than 60 rounds. However, no Japanese warships were seen. The source of the sound has not yet been determined.

### Autumn Colors of the Flower Show (Middle)

— Ai Nong

A pot of "High Mountain Flowing Water Sound" uses English stones to form a mountain with many peaks and valleys. Below are clear, light white stones, and many small trees are planted next to it. On a mountain slope, a person is playing the zither. This is Boya. Below the mountain, a person is quietly listening. That is Zhong Ziqi. This is also a meaningful bonsai that makes people feel nostalgic. In addition, there are small chrysanthemums planted in dead wood, irises planted in sand frogs, as well as pine cranes, wolfberries, finely planted white chrysanthemums, and small red cliffside chrysanthemums. The colors and postures are all beautiful. On a high table behind it, a light imperial concubine-colored chrysanthemum is planted in an ancient bronze tripod, forming a semi-cliff shape. The chrysanthemum is named "Yang Guifei After Bathing." Looking at it, it feels particularly lovely, like the appearance of Consort Yang after bathing in Huaqing Pool. On the table on the left, a mottled bamboo frame is placed high, divided into three grids. On top is a white porcelain ancient water basin filled with small yellow chrysanthemums, arranged in the shape of a flower basket. In the three grids are small cypresses, small chrysanthemums, small wintergreens, arhat pines, sparrow tongue pines, small pumpkins, Qin Weng statues, and Dharma statues. The pots, basins, and seats used are all of various shapes, exquisite and delicate antiques. There is also a small thing that is particularly lovely: a white jade lotus leaf, a white jade lotus root, and a small crab carved from rhinoceros horn crawling on the edge of the lotus leaf. Next to it are placed a few small yellow chrysanthemums, clearly implying the intention of holding a crab and appreciating chrysanthemums. At the bottom is a pot of "Solitary Fishing in Cold River," which is also full of artistic sense.

Next to this bamboo frame, there is a pot of finely planted large white chrysanthemums. The flowers are leaning sideways, as if the bright moon is embracing them, paired with lingzhi, which is also ancient and elegant. Next to it is a large red chrysanthemum in an ancient bronze vase, which feels delicate and even more red and white. On the table on the right is a low mottled bamboo table, displaying three types of chrysanthemums. Although the chrysanthemum varieties are not famous, their postures are extremely wonderful. Especially rare is that the three pots are all works by Yang Pengnian, a master potter from the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, which are naturally extraordinary. In front of the two chrysanthemum stone-carved basins, small chrysanthemums are used as embellishments, which also complement each other appropriately. Beside this low table is a wolfberry old tree, with branches hanging down and full of scarlet wolfberries, as bright as a maiden's agate earrings, which are not easy to see in Shanghai. Below these red berries and green leaves is a white Jian porcelain Dharma statue, which appears even more distinctly red and white.

As I admired and praised, I asked Mr. Zhou how he could have such leisure and elegance in such an isolated environment. Mr. Zhou replied that only in such an environment could he use these flowers and trees as a means of dispelling worries, especially given the international competition, so he was particularly excited. Horticulture may be a small path, but he also wanted to strive for the top internationally, so that Western men and women would not underestimate Chinese horticulture. In short, no matter how big or small things are, if they are related to international affairs, we must work doubly hard to stand out and show them what Chinese people are capable of. After hearing these words, I felt that Mr. Zhou's intentions were very commendable.

A Corner of the Flower Show The flower show opened the day before yesterday, with rare grasses and famous flowers, brilliantly pleasing to the eye. Chinese and foreign horticulture enthusiasts flocked to visit, commenting and pointing, adding to the excitement. "Top Picture" Westerners visit in groups, admiring precious bonsai.

### Hong Kong Immigration Bureau Established, Implementing Import Restrictions, Newly Promulgated Regulations Effective from the 18th of Next Month, Certificates Divided into Three Types: Entry, Residence, and Border, People Going to Hong Kong from Shanghai Should Pay Attention

Reuters, Hong Kong, 20th: The Hong Kong government promulgated new regulations on entry control on the 20th, stating that any person, whether British or Chinese, who does not hold a legal passport or travel document issued by the British authorities for coming to Hong Kong and recognized by the local authorities, will not be allowed to disembark. According to news obtained by this newspaper from reliable sources, the Hong Kong Government Immigration Bureau was officially established on the 18th of this month and began operations. The regulations established are the "Imported Immigration Control Plan," which will be implemented on December 18. The purpose is to prevent undesirable elements from entering Hong Kong. We have obtained the original text and recorded it as follows:

Undesirable Elements Refused Entry

(1) This plan is based on the 1934 Import Passport Law and the report of the Committee on Reducing Surplus Population Problems. (2) This plan stipulates the interrogation of anyone arriving in Hong Kong from outside Hong Kong by ship, junk, plane, and small steamboat, and authorizes enforcement personnel to refuse entry to those they deem undesirable elements. (3) This plan does not have any quota regulations for importing immigrants. Full control is in the hands of the Governor. Regulations restricting the import of people without valid certificates may be increased or decreased at any time to adapt to the environment. When the government deems it necessary, it may apply pressure to any type of transportation—whether it be steamboats (riverboats or ocean liners), junks, or small steamboats. However, the restrictive regulations may also be relaxed according to the environment. (4) To stipulate the type of permit and the handling fee, the following categories are proposed: (A) Small businessmen who are a valuable economic asset to Hong Kong (B) Farmers and fishermen who reside in the Hong Kong border or nearby areas and often come to Hong Kong due to trade relations (C) Hong Kong residents who wish to visit relatives abroad or wish to have their relatives come to Hong Kong to visit them and are unlikely to encounter difficulties. (5) This plan is a plan for issuing permits to return to Hong Kong. Each of these permits specifies a validity period. Within this period, it is valid regardless of the number of times it is entered or exited. These permits are divided into three categories: Entry Permit, Residence Permit, and Border Permit.

Entry Permit

(6) Entry permits are divided into two types: one is valid for only six months and costs two yuan, and the other is valid for two years and costs six yuan. The entry permit must be dated by the executing agency when the holder enters Hong Kong and will expire when the period expires. However, the holder may apply to convert to a new certificate after the certificate expires, but must pay the handling fee again. The following types of people must obtain an entry permit: (A) Hong Kong residents who wish to leave Hong Kong and stay outside Hong Kong for a specified period (B) Those who intend to come to Hong Kong (regardless of whether their purpose of coming to Hong Kong is business or sightseeing), but their application for a certificate can be submitted by writing to the Immigration Bureau or entrusting their relatives and friends in Hong Kong to obtain it on their behalf (C) Those who have arrived at the border of Hong Kong without obtaining a certificate. These people will be severely investigated and may be refused entry. (Note) The general policy is to encourage those who are determined to come to Hong Kong to obtain an entry permit before starting. The application, whether it is a Hong Kong resident, must report their name, status, occupation, and Hong Kong contact address. Foreign tourists must also state their purpose and length of stay. Employers, such as hiring workers from outside Hong Kong, must make a general application. The application will be reviewed by the Immigration Bureau in consultation with the Labor Bureau. If it is deemed necessary to approve the batch of workers, the Immigration Bureau will notify the employer to apply for the application form separately for each worker. As for small businessmen or cargo boat owners who often enter and exit Hong Kong, it is best to obtain a certificate with a two-year validity period.

Residence Permit

(7) Residence permits are divided into two types: the first type costs ten yuan and is issued to legal residents who have resided in Hong Kong for more than four years, and the second type costs five yuan and is issued to legal residents who have resided in Hong Kong for more than ten years. The validity period of these two types of residence permits is five years. Residents who have an occupation, assets, and can prove that their length of stay in Hong Kong meets the regulations may obtain a residence permit.

Border Permit

(8) The border pass fee is two yuan and is valid for one year. It is only issued to farmers, fishermen, and villagers residing in the Hong Kong border area. The purpose of this pass is to facilitate the passage of poor people who come to Hong Kong to sell food by land. Those entering Hong Kong from land can only enter up to the locations to be announced by the government in the future. This plan does not prevent the government from allowing farmers who have been bombed or escaped due to other accidents on the Hong Kong border to enter.

Signing Fee

(9) Applicants must submit two photos of themselves. All certificates must be signed by the Director of the Immigration Bureau. Applicants must also sign their names on the certificate. If they are illiterate, they must affix their fingerprints. (10) The handling fee for issuing entry permits is currently set at two yuan per certificate. However, the government may revise the handling fee at any time when necessary. The current regulation charges two yuan because the fixed amount is not high, and visitors can easily pay it, so as not to drive people away from Hong Kong. The handling fees for various certificates are currently used to maintain the expenses of the Immigration Bureau.

The Following People Are Not Allowed to Obtain Certificates

This type of certificate is not issued to the following categories of people: (A) Those who are sick, disabled, blind, mentally ill, and unable to support themselves (B) Those who cannot prove that they have or have the ability to find a way to maintain their own lives and the lives of their families (C) Professional beggars, or those who are bound to become dependent on charitable organizations for relief (D) Those who are infected with dangerous infectious diseases (E) Those who must hold a passport to come to Hong Kong but do not have a passport, or those who have a fake passport (F) Those who have been deported by any country (G) Those who are suspected of engaging in disruptive work or inciting riots in Hong Kong (H) Those who cannot prove that they will have a job immediately after coming to Hong Kong, or those who cannot prove that they are sure to find a job in Hong Kong (I) Prostitutes or those who make a living by prostitution (J) Those who do not have a certificate as required by the epidemic prevention regulations.

Exemptions

(12) The following categories of people are not restricted by this regulation: (A) Those who have a passport or other travel document (B) Those who are under the age of fifteen. According to passport regulations, those under the age of fifteen do not need to hold a certificate. However, because the age of Chinese children is difficult to determine, in addition to checking supporting documents, another method must be established. It is stipulated that Chinese children who are under four and a half feet tall may be exempted from holding a certificate to enter. (C) Transit passengers refers to passengers traveling by ship to a place outside Hong Kong who only stop by because the ship docks in Hong Kong but the original ship leaves Hong Kong.

The Government May Issue a Mortgage System

(13) The government may order importers to provide a financial mortgage, regardless of whether they have a legal travel document or an import permit. The mortgage will guarantee a period of time. If the person follows all the procedures in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the government during that period, the mortgage will be fully refunded when the person leaves Hong Kong. This method is usually only used to accommodate people who come to Hong Kong for a specified period of stay to ensure that they will leave Hong Kong after the expiration of their residence permit. The mortgage amount will vary depending on the circumstances. (14) The Immigration Bureau will also be responsible for issuing passports.

All Ships and Boats are Under Control

(15) Any ship carrying passengers must, when ordered, sail to the Immigration Bureau's wharf to allow Immigration Bureau officials to inspect passengers. Before all passengers have disembarked, no sampans, junks, or boats may sail within thirty yards of the ship. Any passenger who is prohibited from disembarking may be sent to a detention center for examination. The passenger will be detained there pending deportation from Hong Kong. (16) Boats are only allowed to enter Hong Kong between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM. They may also be instructed to sail to one of the following locations before entering and exiting the port: Shau Kei Wan, Aberdeen, Tung Chung Bay, for inspection. Before the implementation of this plan, a survey of boat households will be conducted. The licenses of boats in the port will be stamped with "In the Port" for identification.

Immigration Bureau

(17) In addition to the headquarters and detention center, the Immigration Bureau's offices are also located in the following places: Tai Po, Lo Wu, Yuen Long, Lok Ma Chau, Shau Kei Wan, Aberdeen, and Tung Chung Bay.

### Customs Commissioner Rochford Reappointed Yesterday

### Telephone Price Increase – Opposition from All Sectors – French Municipal Council Reportedly Approved – Rumors of Implementation in January

The Shanghai Telephone Company submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council for a significant increase in telephone surcharges. After the Municipal Council Board of Directors approved it, the company submitted the price increase plan to the French Municipal Council for review and approval. As of yesterday, it was widely rumored that the French Municipal Council had also approved it, with some saying it would be implemented on January 1st next year. Aware of the significant impact of this matter, this reporter visited relevant parties yesterday to inquire about the truth. They did not deny the rumor that the French Municipal Council had approved it, stating that there might still be some procedures to be resolved, but regardless, the price increase was inevitable. However, they did not confirm the January 1st implementation date, as the exact starting date had not yet been determined. Various sectors in the city believe that the scale of the telephone company's price increase has broken the record for all other public utilities. If implemented, it would not only have a negative impact on the city's commerce, but also place an unbearable burden on the majority of residents, thus rendering public utilities meaningless. Therefore, they unanimously oppose the imminent price increase and jointly request the authorities of both concessions to thoroughly investigate the telephone company's income and expenditure before making a serious decision. If the increase is unavoidable, the amount should be reduced to allow residents of the city some breathing room.

### Comedy Nearly Turns to Tragedy – Newlyweds Frightened – Gunman's Target Seemed to be the Groom – Guide Company Rickshaw Puller Dies in Vain

Lu Ding, 21 years old, from Changshu, a shareholder of the Lihuilu General Association (formerly the Hollywood Amusement Park on Yuyuan Road) and concurrently operating a rice business with Wanli Rice Store on Fangxie Road in the South City, held his wedding banquet at the Dasanxing Changshu Restaurant at No. 679, next to the Sanshan Guild Hall at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Yunnan Road. He married Sun Cuiying, and the wedding was filled with guests and lively cheer.

Suddenly, Gunshots as They Ascended the Stairs

Around 7 PM last night, after the wedding ceremony in the downstairs hall, the newlyweds were walking arm in arm up the stairs, intending to retire to their room. Unexpectedly, the joyful scene was short-lived as disaster struck. Three thugs ambushed at the bottom of the staircase, two of them wielding guns and aiming at the couple, firing a barrage of shots. Due to their poor marksmanship, all four bullets missed their target.

Four Missed Shots Cause Chaos

Two bullets hit the abacus rack beside the staircase, one hit the edge of the staircase, and the other struck the mirror frame behind the accounting office. The scene erupted in chaos, and guests and relatives fled into the kitchen to avoid the gunfire. The newlyweds also desperately sought refuge, escaping injury but suffering a great fright.

Escaping Without Capture

As the gunmen fled, they fired another shot. At this moment, a Chinese constable on duty at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Fuzhou Road, having heard the commotion, rushed to the scene. The gunmen fled into the crowd, and the constable gave chase, firing three shots as they fled towards the entrance of Fuxiang Lane on Yunnan Road. The gunmen returned fire with one shot.

Amid the chaos of flying bullets, a stray bullet struck Chen Jinsheng, a rickshaw puller (25 years old) from Chongming working for the Fenghuang Guide Company at No. 8 Fuxiang Lane, in the left temple, piercing his right abdomen. He collapsed at the entrance of the lane, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. He was rushed to Renji Hospital by ambulance but died due to the severity of his injuries.

### Gang Robbery on Connaught Road – Police and Robbers Exchange Gunfire – Stray Bullet Injures Pedestrian

On Connaught Road and Yanping Road in Western Shanghai, around 10 AM yesterday morning, a group of people were passing by when three robbers in mixed uniforms suddenly emerged from the roadside. Two of them, armed with pistols, blocked their path and robbed them of twenty yuan in national currency. After the incident, the victims secretly followed the robbers and called for help.

The constable returned fire with one shot, but the robbers managed to escape. During the exchange of gunfire, a passing pedestrian was struck by a stray bullet and was taken to the hospital for treatment. One suspect was apprehended at the scene and taken to the Gordon Road Police Station for questioning. However, after a thorough search revealed no firearms or other prohibited items, he was released.

The book, titled "Travels in Yan and Lu," is now published and sold by the author's publishing house.

### Kunming Municipal Government Takes Care of Evacuated Students – Orders All Schools to Establish Branch Schools – Promulgates Eight Key Points for Implementation and Compliance – Local Classes Can Be Requested for Students Numbering Over Twenty

(Kunming News Agency) To ensure the education of evacuated students, the Kunming Municipal Government previously ordered all schools to establish branch schools within a specified timeframe. Given the importance of this matter, the Municipal Government has formulated eight key points for managing branch schools during the evacuation period for municipal primary schools. These have been issued to all municipal primary schools, teaching service teams, and inspectors for compliance. They are also required to report on their implementation. The key points for managing branch schools during the evacuation period for municipal primary schools are as follows:

Key Points for Managing Branch Schools

(1) The establishment of branch schools by municipal primary schools should be based on the designated district in Kunming where the school is located. If there is any insertion of schools from other districts, they should be transferred to the school in that district for management, so that the branch schools established by each school are concentrated in one area for easier management.

(2) The teaching service teams of the current municipal teacher service corps are divided into five groups and are responsible for promoting branch schools, investigating evacuated students, and encouraging enrollment in five evacuation districts. The principals of each school should cooperate with the group to actively promote the branch schools of their school and expand them to more than one-half of the original number of classes before November 10th.

(3) If, after investigation, there are more than twenty evacuated students in each rural village, they can consult with local people and parents of students to jointly find a school building, transport desks and chairs, and set up a school for teaching. If necessary, open-air teaching can be implemented, or classes can be borrowed from local county primary schools.

(4) The organization of students in branch schools stipulates that if the number of students is within forty, regardless of grade level, they should not be divided into classes and should adopt single-grade teaching. If there are more than forty students, if the grade level is above five groups, they can be divided into two classes. If the grade level is within four groups, they should still not be divided into classes. If the number of students reaches more than sixty, regardless of the number of grades, they can be divided into classes for teaching.

(5) The principle for teachers in branch schools is to transfer teachers from the original school. If there is a need to serve in other districts for the convenience of family evacuation, the procedure for requesting a change of teacher assignment can be handled within the possible range. The original principal should submit it to the Municipal Government for approval in consultation with the leader of the teaching service team in the district. As for the number of teachers in each branch school, two teachers should be assigned to a one-class branch school, and one teacher should be added for each additional two-class branch school. Those with more than four classes should be handled in accordance with the municipal primary school organization regulations.

(6) Branch schools should hold classes for four hours each day. The time should be determined by each school based on its environment and reported. The curriculum should be handled in accordance with the municipal primary school's past regulations for shortened class hours.

(7) After each branch school is established and starts classes, it should prepare various routine forms and reports in accordance with the regulations of the municipal primary school and submit them to the Municipal Government.

(8) The implementation of each branch school will be inspected and examined by inspectors and teaching service teams at any time. The methods of reward and punishment will be determined separately.

### President Chiang Urges Implementation – Military Management of Youth – Promulgates Various Training Regulations for Execution

(Chongqing News Agency) President Chiang believes that the purpose of implementing military management in secondary schools is to cultivate well-disciplined and responsible youth. At a time when national construction is advancing at an accelerated pace, the need for youth's efforts is extremely important. If they do not know what responsibility and discipline are when they are in school, how can they achieve the achievements of opening up things and completing tasks? In severe cases, it may even affect the entire school due to one person's self-abandonment and harm society and the country. All public secondary schools should pay special attention to military training and strict military management and must not let it go. The Ministry of Education should also order compliance and issue various training regulations for implementation.

### Fantasia During Safety Week

— Ge Chunliang

So many stars: red stars, white stars, yellow stars, green stars, blue stars, purple stars, radiating light before my eyes, spinning before my eyes, until my consciousness cleared and I realized I was lying in front of a bus.

I didn’t know when I was hit by the bus, nor did I know why I was hit. I remember cautiously looking both ways before crossing the street, but, in any case, in short, I was lying under a bus.

Within minutes, many people gathered in a circle, seemingly to protect me. Each of them offered their own opinions, of course focusing on me.

"What happened?"

"Look at that person."

"Who told him to be careless when walking!"

"Blood!"

"Look at all that blood!"

"So pitiful!"

"Will he die?"

"That's hard to say..."

Soon, more and more people came to watch. Although I was groaning, my ears were very sharp, and all the sounds were clearly audible.

I heard the passengers on a tram: –

"What's going on? Why did the tram stop?"

"How annoying, what's happened again?"

"Probably a bus ran someone over?"

"Yes, it's a bus."

"Ah! It's better to die these days, to avoid suffering."

"How annoying!" Suddenly, a sharp and soft voice, filled with anger, said, "How annoying!"

"How annoying!"

"Couldn't he find somewhere else to die?"

"Doesn't know what's good for him!"

"This kind of pig!"

A very innocent child shouted, "Look, the trams behind are stopped like a dragon: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven..."

"All because of that old rascal!" This was the general opinion.

Is this my fault? Is it my mistake? Did I want to be under the bus?

The driver who hit me with the bus, his face pale, with anger in his expression, climbed out of the bus and stood in front of me, pointing at me and saying in a trembling voice, "If you want to die, you should die properly, if you want to commit suicide, you should find a place, why harm others! ... Ah, bad luck for me!"

The tram driver echoed, "Damn it, ask that bastard if he brought his eyes with him!"

"Haha..." — The audience laughed loudly.

I stared around, and in that glance, I saw the people laughing with their mouths open, and I also saw the real tears of the driver. I quickly closed my eyes, I didn't want to see anymore.

These laughs – whether real or fake – were probably a condolence to the unfortunate person run over by the bus. However, I have no experience of being hit by a bus, so I am completely unaware of the meaning of those laughs. Perhaps... perhaps this is, thanks to their kindness, a comfort for the injured person? But perhaps, this is a punishment for the "criminal"!

Soon, the ambulance came and lifted me onto a stretcher. I glanced at the neighborhood as I left. Perhaps because my head was facing the sky, I only saw a flag fluttering in the air, with big words on it: "Safety Movement."

I thought, thought, thought, I thought of my wife and children at home; I thought of the tearful driver; I thought of the laughing crowd; I also rambled about everything: I tried my best to suppress the surging thoughts, but they kept湧ing out like a spring.

Later, I was "completely disillusioned."

But I died.

The nurse – or rather, the "angel in white" – said disgustedly:

"It's too late!"

Died! ... Alas –

Died!

Huo Sang Detective Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 10: Zhao Boxiong's Confession

I then said, "Then, based on what did you assume that the assassin was from inside the house?"

Huo Sang said, "There are several reasons: First, Wang Lilan's death clearly occurred while she was sitting in the chair in front of her desk. She showed no signs of struggle, but her eyes retained a look of horror. This suggests that the assassin was very familiar with the deceased and not wary of them, definitely not a sudden outsider, or someone who originally had any resentment towards her. Therefore, when that person suddenly assassinated her, she didn't have time to resist; however, in the moment of death, her eyes couldn't help but reveal surprise. Second, there are the strange shoe prints on the floor. We know that besides the deceased's own, there were two sets of prints, A and B. The B prints were deep when going in and shallow when going out, and the in and out steps were not very neat. Now we know that this set of B prints was left by the raincoat man. That person lingered in the reception room for a long time, and their shoes rubbed against the carpet, so the prints were so faint when going out that they were almost invisible. The A prints are very different, both the in and out steps are very clear, and the two rows of in and out steps are neat and orderly, without any overlapping traces. This doesn't seem like someone who went in from the outside, lingered in the room for a while, and then came out; rather, it seems like someone went in from the outside, walked into the room, stood at the edge of the carpet, and immediately retreated. This is certainly a possible assumption, but it's not very sound or reasonable, because the two rows of in and out steps are too distinct. A more logical assumption is that someone deliberately left these in and out footprints to make people believe that someone went in from the outside and later came out from the inside. Why? The natural conclusion is that the person was originally in the house, they did something illegal, but wanted to shift the suspicion to someone from the outside.

"However, since I had the first, though not very reasonable, assumption, I had to first eliminate the doubts on the periphery. I had to verify that the several suspects from the outside had not actually entered the house before my second assumption could be established. Unfortunately, these A shoe prints involved Lu Jiansheng and Lao Mao, making the relationship even more complicated. Therefore, I had to first explain all possible suspicions clearly.

"Later, the truth of the case gradually developed, and the people who might have entered the house were all verified and eliminated one by one. I then carefully assessed the people in the house one by one. Anna also told me that Lilan and Li Shouqi had a marriage engagement. This led me to shift my attention to Li Zifan. Because, solely in terms of motive, besides the simple monetary purpose, there was also the resentment of a broken engagement. I then began to imagine the possibilities of his actions."

Huo Sang explained this complex relationship and his thought process, seemingly somewhat tired. He took a few puffs of his cigarette, closed his eyes again, both to rest and to organize his thoughts. (173)

### Story

— Su Nong

Far, far away, even before "the creation of the world," at that time, the universe was in a state of "chaos"...

Suddenly, in a place full of stones, a group of "humans" was discovered. They were hungry, so they took the stones to fill their stomachs. They "lived peacefully" like this for quite some time.

Later, one of them, after "eating his fill," thought of "thirst," and then thought of how to quench his thirst, so he thought of drinking other people's blood!

He used a "brilliant method": he gathered all the stones together and said, "These are mine! You can't take them randomly!" The others thought that all the stones were with him, so of course they had nothing to say; however, they couldn't starve after all, so they had to beg him. He said, "Whoever gives me some of their blood will be allowed to take a stone!"

So, he quenched his thirst; the others were also able to fill their stomachs. They "lived peacefully" like this for quite some time.

One day, "misfortune" finally came: the reason was that the others became "extremely intelligent." They felt that their blood was gradually being drained, and if this continued, they would "die" just like they had no stones to eat. Why not "take a chance"?

Immediately, they all rushed to the place where the stones were piled up. Although their bodies were a bit weak, "the power of cooperation was great," and they finally achieved victory! "Stones are no longer rare!"

I am telling a "story". Far, far away...

### Utilization of Exam Papers

— Zhi

This is a kind of waste utilization. The exam papers of middle school students in schools, after the teachers have read and marked them, are generally put on the shelf by the school, or burned as waste paper. However, in this era of soaring paper prices, I think that these used exam papers can be used, because exam papers are only written on one side (the front side has horizontal grids, the back side has no grids). You can turn it over and print lecture notes and exam questions on the blank side, and you can also print other less important books and pamphlets in the school. In this way, you can save the school's expenses, and the students' parents can pay a little less for lecture notes. It is really a win-win situation. Our school has been doing this since this semester. Although it has only been two short months, it feels applicable, so I dare to write it out. Why not adopt it and try it by the school authorities!

### Talking About the "Painted Face" Actor Yuan Shihai

— A Person From Both North And South

Currently, in the Peking Opera world, the "painted face" actors have either died or grown old. Hao Shouchen has retired, and Hou Xirui hasn't come south for a long time. In recent years, the only three who have frequently traveled between north and south are Liu Lianrong, Qiu Shengrong, and Yuan Shihai. Among them, Yuan Shihai is the most popular and successful offstage. Yuan is the top "painted face" actor of the fifth class of the Fu Liancheng Opera School. Originally from Hong County, Henan, he was the young master of the Yuan Xiaoji carriage company. People called him "Young Master Yuan". He entered the opera school at the age of twelve, initially studying old male roles, but later switched to "painted face". He was mentored by Xiao Changhua and Wang Lianping. He has a natural good voice, high and bright. Being high and bright is not enough, what is valuable is being high and bright but also rich and natural, with a grand and majestic air. His appearance is heroic and majestic. Being heroic and majestic is not enough, what is valuable is being heroic and majestic but also powerful and energetic. When watching a play, regardless of the role, what one watches is a sense of grandeur, and Yuan Shihai is qualified in all of the above. As for the words he speaks, their rise and fall, speed and slowness, each word is powerful and extremely clear; his body: every gesture, proper and upright, is extremely expressive, and he has expression on his face, portraying treacherous heroes and chivalrous men, each to its best. In new terms, it is called having "acting" art. Zhou Xinfang was able to create his own style because he fulfilled his utmost responsibility in the "acting" of "acting," and Yuan Shihai's plays seem similar. Yuan Shihai is meticulous in his large movements, vivid and detailed, and in his small movements, he is not negligent at all. His performance of Cao Cao is so good that the old Peking Opera connoisseurs praise him as the first living Cao Cao after Huang Runpu (Huang Runpu was known as the living Cao Cao during his lifetime). Other highlights include Li Kui in Xunyang Tower and Dingjia Mountain, Ma Su in Empty City Stratagem, Gu Du in Four Scholars, Xu Jia in Gifting a Silk Robe, Zhang Zhongjie in The Red Brush, Zhang Fei in Reed Flower Shoal, Liu Jin in Famen Temple, Bawang in Farewell My Concubine, and Dou Erdun in Stealing the Imperial Horse, which are considered his best among his best. He initially decided to come south before the war, following Shang Xiaoyun, and already won praise. His second time in the south was last year with Song Dezhu, and later assisting Zhang Eyun. This year is his third southern tour, first partnering with Ma Suliang. The Golden Stage authorities, because of his popularity with the audience, kept him. Then it was Mao Shilai, Li Shengzao, and Xin Yanqiu, who all requested Yuan Shihai to be kept before they came. Thus, Yuan Shihai was retained. Because things are rare, they are valued, he actually created a situation where everyone was抢ing him. In this light, who else but Shihai can carry the banner of the "painted face" after Hou Xirui and Hao Shouchen? Moreover, he is only twenty years old this year, there is still a future to come!

### Portraits of Female Artists

— Tang

(6) Tang Ruoqing

No one can deny that Tang Ruoqing has made great contributions to the current status of the China Traveling Troupe.

Ruoqing is the eldest daughter of Tang Huaiqiu, the head of the China Traveling Troupe. When Ruoqing was a child, Tang Huaiqiu left home to study aeronautics in France! Huaiqiu stayed in France for six years before returning to Shanghai. When he returned home, he knocked on the door, and a girl came out to open it. She saw Huaiqiu and didn't recognize him. She asked Huaiqiu who he was looking for. When she saw her mother hugging and crying with the person who opened the door, she realized that it was her father who had returned. - Tang Huaiqiu often excitedly told people about this interesting story of his daughter not recognizing her father when he was drunk.

Since Tang Huaiqiu organized the China Traveling Troupe, Ruoqing has dedicated herself to the spoken drama movement. The China Traveling Troupe has been traveling around for several years, and Ruoqing's footprints have spread throughout North China, Central China, and South China. Therefore, she not only has rich stage experience, but also rich life experience.

Ruoqing has a relatively strong personality, so she is suitable for acting in passionate dramas. For example, her role as Ge Nenniang in "Remnants of the Late Ming Dynasty" was a great success. Her pronunciation is slightly sandy, but every word is clear and powerful. I once praised her as "the female Kylin Tong on the spoken drama stage."

Ruoqing's only hobby in life is mangoes. Last time she came from Hong Kong, she brought many mangoes and ate them whole, almost replacing her three meals a day. She lives with her parents and sister Ruoying in Laidu Road. It is an artistic home. The entrance is the living room, with a dining table in the center, covered with a tablecloth. A vase is filled with a bunch of carnations. A corner by the window is a sofa and coffee table. Photos are hung on the wall, all artistic, beautiful and clean. They also raise many ducklings and plant loofah (that is in the summer) and tomatoes. In addition, cats and dogs have become Ruoqing's most familiar companions.

Judging from Ruoqing's physique, everyone thinks she is very strong. Her appearance is the opposite of a frail woman, but since she came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, she has often been sick. The doctor diagnosed her as having blood deficiency, so she has been constantly getting injections for several months; because of her poor health, it has also affected her acting. The reason why she doesn't often appear on stage is because of this reason. (Gu Lanjun's diary tomorrow)

### Modern Photography Techniques (Part 2)

— Xu Ming A.R.P.S.

The artistic vision changes with the times. Photography is a record of the times, recording the artistic trends of each era. Photography art in the previous era mostly tended to be secluded, soft, and scenic, while modern photography tends to be magnificent, sharp, and documentary.

Therefore, the conclusion about aperture mentioned above is that now you should use a smaller aperture and a slower shutter speed; try to achieve this goal as much as possible within the possible range. The result will be more beautiful than using the commonly used aperture and shutter speed. As for not letting a good shooting opportunity slip away, it is an essential factor. In order to achieve a magnificent result for the same subject, we need to talk about the techniques of angle and lighting.

Modern photography angles and lighting have completely overturned the previous vision. What was previously considered undesirable, such as top light, back light, side light; and what was previously unworthy of emulation, such as side shots, low shots, upward shots, and downward shots, are now considered beautiful. In the past, whether it was landscape, portrait, or still life photography, it was all flat. Now it needs to be three-dimensional. These reasons and angles have caused a great change in lighting. The lessons learned from those old photography books are now almost abandoned; don't stick to the previous methods, placing the lens rigidly in front of the subject; instead, try to take various angles from top to bottom, from left to right, and use various kinds of light. As for how to make the angle and light beautiful, that is not only a matter of technique, but also a matter of insight.

In outdoor photography, in order to make the angle beautiful, you sometimes have to lie on the ground, squat by the river, lean against the corner of the house, climb up a tree, try various angles, and take various kinds of light. If you are afraid of hardship, you cannot get a good photo. Why is that? It's actually very simple; originally, if we use a pen to draw, the addition and deletion of scenes can be embellished at will, but photography is originally "writing reality"; often, a slight movement of the subjective position can make the scene completely different. Also, often in order to pull a certain object into the picture, or to avoid a certain object, you have to move the subjective position of the lens as much as possible; although the techniques in the darkroom can also remedy these shortcomings, they are still "losing" "reality." It is not a perfect photo.

As for indoor photography, then you can arbitrarily control the lighting and angle. Although sometimes in winter, arranging a beautiful shot often makes you sweat profusely. Because the opportunity for photography is rare, and sometimes you can't distinguish the good angles of light, you should choose the best angles of light at the same time for the same subject, and take several consecutive shots. Outdoors, sometimes in order to wait for the proper and beautiful light, to wait for the embellishment of wind, clouds, people, boats, birds, and animals, you will patiently wait for several hours. Photography is not a difficult thing, the difficulty lies in not being afraid of hardship; casual photography will hardly have beautiful results.

To create a magnificent photo, you must also have the determination to sacrifice and progress. When you encounter an opportunity and the subject has two or more main scenes, if you pull them together, they will not look good; a flat narrative is especially scattered, with no distinction between the main and the guests; then quickly decide to sacrifice, one main body per shot. Otherwise, cutting and trimming will not be able to create a perfect photo.

Seeing more masterpieces and studying their structure is a key way to train your eye.

The artistic vision of photography in the modern world is changing very quickly, and some people even use military art to show off their strength. We must pay attention and imagine at any time and place, and the techniques we use must also change and study at any time and place. We must not allow ourselves to be stubborn and confident. This is my small contribution.
