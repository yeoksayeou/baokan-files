### Countering the Japanese Threat to Advance South: Britain Appoints Commander-in-Chief for the Far East to Ensure Coordination and Mutual Support of Naval, Land, and Air Forces; Sir Robert Brooke-Popham to Take Office in Singapore

London: The official announcement has been made regarding the decision to establish the office of Commander-in-Chief for the Far East. It is stated that the British government bears the responsibility of protecting its territories in the Far East. In view of the current stage of defense arrangements in the Far East, and in order to ensure their adjustment and management, it has been decided to appoint a single Commander-in-Chief for the Far East. All general officers commanding British forces in Malaya, Burma, and Hong Kong, as well as the officer commanding the Royal Air Force in the Far East, will be under his command. The new Commander-in-Chief will consult and cooperate with the Commanders-in-Chief of the Royal Navy in China and the East Indies, as well as the Commander-in-Chief in India. He will also maintain close contact with the Governors of Burma and relevant colonies, and will liaise with the governments of Australia and New Zealand on matters concerning them. The new Commander-in-Chief will also be responsible for maintaining contact on defense matters with British representatives in the various countries of the Far East, or in foreign countries related to the Far East. The British government has selected Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham for this new position, and he will soon take office at the headquarters in Singapore. The Commander-in-Chief's staff will be composed of officers from the Navy, Army, and Air Force, in order to ensure the coordination and mutual support of their activities. The Chief of Staff will be Major General De Wiart. Well-informed sources claim that the continued deployment of British troops to the Far East makes this arrangement extremely important. Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, the first Commander-in-Chief for the Far East, is currently sixty-two years old. He graduated from the Staff College and began his career in the ranks, joining the Oxfordshire Light Infantry. In 1912, he joined the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers (the predecessor of the Royal Air Force). He has demonstrated talent in both command and management, and has received numerous awards. He served as the first Commandant of the RAF Staff College, Commander of the RAF in Iraq, and Air Defense Commander-in-Chief in Great Britain. In 1937, he was appointed Governor of Kenya. Upon the outbreak of war, he returned to military service, joining the British Aviation Mission to Canada as a senior member. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)

London: The British government announced yesterday the establishment of a Far East Command, under the command of General Brooke-Popham. Government officials also stated that according to reports from the Far East, reinforcements have arrived in areas threatened by Japan's southward advance. These reports strongly suggest that Japan's southward advance may not be far off. The primary target is Saigon, and the start of the southward offensive will likely coincide with the announcement of the Soviet-Japanese conciliation agreement, which may be concluded in Berlin this week. According to reports from the Far East, large numbers of Japanese troops are concentrated on Hainan Island, Taiwan, and in Kwangchow Bay, where a large number of troop transports are gathered, seemingly preparing to sail to Saigon. Judging from various indications, the invasion of Saigon is only the first step in Japan's large-scale territorial expansion in South Asia. These reports even claim that the Japanese army is withdrawing its troops from along the Yangtze River to increase its southward offensive strength. Recent official reports carried by Japanese semi-official newspapers and news agencies prove that the southward offensive is imminent. For example, they falsely claim that Vietnam permits anti-Japanese sentiment and pro-Tagore public opinion to become widespread around Saigon, that the French authorities in Vietnam are abusing workers in various ways, and that there are conflicting reports about the resignation of the Governor of Vietnam, Mr. Decoux, with Hanoi denying that it has recognized the matter. These rumors may indicate that the Governor of Vietnam is resisting Japanese demands for naval and air bases. A report from Bangkok yesterday stated that Thailand is concentrating a large army on the Vietnamese border, reportedly planning to invade Vietnam around December 1st. Their goal is likely to meet up with the southward-advancing Japanese forces, allowing Japanese power to reach the Indian Ocean, establishing bases on its coast, and thus threatening the flanks of Singapore.

Hong Kong: A British military spokesman recently stated that the British appointment of General Brooke-Popham as Commander of the British Far East Command indicates that Britain has greater plans for the defense of the Far East. He also pointed out that this appointment will not have any impact on the British garrison and the Hong Kong government here. (Associated Press, 14th)

Chongqing: This morning's editorial in the Central Daily News stated that the Japanese occupation of all of French Indochina has now become a confirmed fact. However, it is still questionable whether Japan will immediately launch attacks on Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. When Japan requested passage through Vietnam to advance its troops, we warned France that the occupation of Haiphong and Hanoi was not aimed at China, but was a plan to occupy the entire Vietnam as a base for southward expansion. Now, Japan intends to develop Saigon into a major base in its southward expansion program, which will take at least two or three years to accomplish. At the same time, there are still ten thousand French troops stationed in Vietnam. If motivated by patriotism, they may be able to put up a strong resistance. The loss of Saigon did not begin today, but when the Vichy government accepted the Japanese request to land troops in Haiphong. While Japan's occupation of Saigon is part of its southward expansion plan, Japan is still adopting a wait-and-see policy and has not immediately attacked Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, likely due to the election of President Roosevelt and the increasingly fierce resistance of the Chinese army. Although some factions in Japan are advocating an immediate southward advance, Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka prefer to pay attention to the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union. If the United States prepares to use force to prevent Japan's southward advance, and the Soviet Union also prepares to intervene, then Japan will temporarily suspend its actions. However, while we do not believe that Japan will immediately advance southward, we expect Japan will ultimately do so. Therefore, the only path that the United States and the Soviet Union can take is to respond to actions with actions, and to respond to force with force. Vietnam is a lesson for all countries, showing that hoping to preserve existence through concessions will ultimately fail. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)

### The Situation on the Thai-Vietnamese Border Becomes Increasingly Tense; Governor of Vietnam Denies Resignation

Bangkok: According to reports received here, the situation on the Thai-Vietnamese border became increasingly tense yesterday. A French aircraft flew over Thai territory. Yesterday, Vientiane crossed the border and fired three shots at Thai territory across the Mekong River, fortunately without injuring anyone. Currently, Major General Songgram, the Prime Minister of Thailand and Minister of Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Interior, has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Thai Army by the King.

Vichy: According to yesterday's French official gazette, the authority of the Vietnamese authorities will be limited in the future. The economic and financial conferences of Vietnam and the colonial conferences composed of various political parties will also be prohibited, but consular conferences and municipal conferences may be held.

### Difficult to Expect Improvement in US-Japan Relations; The Status Quo in the Pacific Has Been Destroyed; It Will Be Difficult for Ambassador Nomura to Achieve Anything in the United States; Japan Prepares to Seize Cam Ranh Bay as a Base

Washington: Officials here are reluctant to say much about US-Japan relations, preferring to wait for an announcement from Tokyo. According to what has been heard here, Admiral Nomura will be the Japanese ambassador to the United States. It is well known that Nomura spent a long time in the United States years ago, and newspapers say he has friendly feelings towards the United States. However, the previous Japanese ambassador to the United States, Horinouchi, was also quite popular in the United States. Whether Nomura can achieve more success than Horinouchi does not depend on the friendly feelings of the Japanese ambassador to the United States, but on the policies of Tokyo. If these policies do not change, political observers here see no hope for improvement in US-Japan relations, because the future of this relationship is related to the political status quo in the entire Pacific region. Several months ago, both the US and Japanese governments formally stated their willingness to maintain the status quo. The United States has not changed its attitude on this matter, but the Japanese government has changed its position, changing the status quo in the Far East. Having already invaded Haiphong, today it is preparing to land in Saigon and seize Cam Ranh Bay as a naval base, clearly intending to continue destroying France's territorial jurisdiction in the East. Japan previously claimed that the reason why Japanese troops entered northern Vietnam was a step towards military action against the Chongqing government. Now, if it advances on Saigon and seizes Cam Ranh, then the claim of taking action against Chongqing will be exposed as a pretext. Well-informed sources here now believe that Japan will soon implement its plan to land in Saigon, with the technical assistance of German advisors in Japan. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)

Washington: Undersecretary of State Welles refused to comment yesterday on reports that Admiral Nomura will be appointed Ambassador to the United States. Welles stated that he hoped to formally receive the letter of appointment from Tokyo. Yesterday, newspapers reported that the Japanese government had appointed Nomura as Ambassador to the United States. As for the formal letter of appointment, it must await approval from Washington.

Editorial

### Why Not Settle the Far East First?

Five decades ago, Germany sacrificed French Indochina to appease Japan and form an alliance. This newspaper pointed out that this revealed Germany's awareness of its inability to defeat Britain. A month ago, Britain decided to reopen the Burma Road for military transport to China. This was a sign of Britain's gradually restored confidence in the European war and an expression of its commitment to maintaining a parallel foreign policy in the Far East with the United States. Now, the United States is strengthening its military capabilities in the Philippines and is cooperating with Britain and Australia on joint defense in the Pacific. Britain, with a courageous and strong stance, is continuously dispatching troops to the Far East. Yesterday, it formally announced the establishment of the Far East Military District, with General Brooke-Popham as the Commander-in-Chief, and a large-scale staff organized by naval, land, and air force officers. The scope of the military district extends east to Hong Kong and west to Burma on the coast of the Indian Ocean, including the British Malaya Peninsula, with the Singapore naval base, known as the "Key to the Orient," as the headquarters. In addition to the naval, land, and air forces within the military district being under its command, it is also responsible for consulting and cooperating with the Commanders-in-Chief of the Royal Navy in China and the East Indies and the Commander-in-Chief in India, and for maintaining close liaison with the governments of Australia and New Zealand on matters concerning them. It can be seen that the "Far East Military District" has a wide range of responses and is a very large and complete British organization in the Far East. The recent measures taken by Britain and the United States factually prove how actively the two countries are paralleling their policies in the Far East; they also illustrate that Britain's confidence in the future of the European war is becoming stronger, leading to such arrangements in the Far East. This is precisely the time for Japan to consider taking the risk of advancing southward!

If the Soviet Union, with its aspirations for non-belligerence and anti-aggression, had stopped Germany's world domination plan, along with that of Italy and Japan, in Berlin, through Mr. Molotov and his delegation; or at least had expressed wisely and firmly during the long talks that it would never collude with the Axis powers and never provide behind-the-scenes support for those seeking hegemony; then the degree of global turmoil and the scope of war could not only be expected not to increase and expand, but could also promote a rapid and decisive turn in the overall situation; because, judging from the bright side, the Soviet Union does hold the factor that determines global safety. If the outcome of the Berlin talks is contrary to our expectations, then what Germany and Italy have launched in Europe, and towards the Mediterranean and Africa, and what Japan is plotting in Asia, and towards the Pacific and Indian Oceans, are now indeed gradually entering a stage of merging into a single flame, creating a single furnace; and the emphasis on strength in South Asia by Britain and the United States, as well as Britain's establishment of the Far East Military District, are precisely emergency measures to deal with this stage. Coming out of death and entering life, scheming and fighting, fearing to fall behind, and striving to control opportunities, this is a masterpiece of human intelligence, and also a ruthless slaughter!

The outcome of the secret talks in Berlin is unknowable. Its spatial outcome is not sufficient to dominate the Pacific, and its temporal outcome is not sufficient to determine the distant future; but in terms of the decisive stage of global change, it will inevitably be directly affected by these secret talks, and its revelation will be within the next few days. In other words, in just a few more days, there will be significant developments in global change. Wishful thinking and optimism are useless. In order to cope with all the most dangerous and adverse possibilities, the various measures taken by Britain and the United States so far are still insufficient. The Axis powers use the strategy of divide and conquer as their main tactic. European countries such as Poland, Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, as well as Austria and Czechoslovakia in the past, and Romania recently, have all been sacrificed under the strategy of divide and conquer. Italy disregarded Greece, but splashed chili peppers all over its face; Japan attempted to divide China and use it for its own purposes, but found itself trapped in a quagmire; this was a failure, and its original intention was also to divide and conquer. Of course, Britain and the United States are not unaware of the Axis strategy, at least they must have seen through it by now, but their response is not sharp enough. In other words, what goes hand in hand with the Axis powers' strategy of divide and conquer is the blitzkrieg tactic. There are many examples of using the blitzkrieg tactic to complete their divide and conquer, while China and Britain are using long-term warfare as a way to resist, which has now obviously been effective. What is regrettable is that the world is confused by the charm touted by the Axis powers. First, it fears their combination, then it fears that a total solution cannot be found, and now it believes that only a slow total solution is possible; in short, it has not thought about solving each issue separately. Let's imagine: what if Britain and the United States had immediately aided China in 1931 during the September 18th Incident to deal with Japan? What if, when Germany attacked Poland, or as late as when it attacked Norway, Britain had immediately used its navy and France its army to deal with Italy? The world would certainly not be in the same situation as it is now, and there would be no such thing as the arrogant and violent so-called Axis group. Regret is useless. But we firmly believe that the best policy at present is to immediately take effective action, to give China more effective aid, to jointly eliminate the root of the disaster in the Far East first, to cut off the wings of the Axis powers, and to stabilize the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and then to clarify the European situation. This is the separate solution to deal with divide and conquer. The United States' increased defense in the Philippines and Britain's establishment of the Far East Military District are only focused on self-preservation, which is not enough.

### Chinese Troops Attacking Qinzhou Completely Recapture the City; Japanese Troops Retreat to Longmen Port; No More Japanese Traces in Southwestern Guangdong

Nanning: The various Chinese armies attacking Qinzhou County continued to capture strongholds south of Qingshuiwo, including Baishuitang, Gongwo Ridge, Longkou, and Luliling on the 13th. Under the pressure of the Chinese army from three sides, the Japanese troops in Qinzhou County retreated to Longmen Port in full force late on the 13th. The Chinese army recaptured Qinzhou City on the 14th. (14th Telegraph)

Longzhou: Continuing to pursue the remaining Japanese troops towards Qinzhou County after recapturing Pingleqiao, the Chinese army's progress has been extremely rapid. By the evening of the 12th, they had already advanced close to the suburbs, surrounding the city on three sides. After suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese were in great panic. In recent days, they have begun to withdraw important military supplies through Shajing and Longmen. The Chinese are continuing their fierce attack. (14th Telegraph)

Tokyo: The headquarters of the Japanese Imperial Army recently stated that the army withdrew from Qinzhou yesterday without losing a single soldier. The Japanese troops in southwestern Guangdong and parts of the Japanese-occupied areas of Guangxi have thus completed their withdrawal. The withdrawn troops will be deployed elsewhere. Since the Japanese army has already entered Vietnam, activities in the Guangdong-Guangxi area are no longer necessary. (Associated Press, 14th)

Chongqing: This afternoon, a spokesman for the Chinese army announced at a routine press conference that Japanese troops are still engaged in rear-guard fighting in the Qinzhou area to cover the slow withdrawal of their troops. The advancing Chinese army is now less than five miles away from Qinzhou. After the recapture of Qinzhou, it will be possible to hinder Japanese activities in Hainan Island, Haiphong, and Kwangchow Bay. There has been little activity on other fronts in the past week, except for Japanese troops seizing heights near Yichang to the west to control nearby airfields, and Chinese troops cutting off the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway in several places. The spokesman added that Japanese troops are still being transferred back from remote areas and concentrated in major bases. However, this action should not be regarded as a withdrawal. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)

Hong Kong: Naval authorities in Hong Kong have again ordered British ships to stop sailing to Kwangchow Bay. British ships scheduled to sail to that area on the 14th have stopped sailing. However, ships from neutral countries are still sailing. According to news from Kwangchow Bay, the sea off the coasts of Hainan Island, Kwangchow Bay, and Haiphong is full of Japanese warships.

### Fierce Fighting in the Shabutang Area

Somewhere in Eastern Jiangxi: After occupying strongholds such as Shabutang on the east bank of the Fu River, the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi has been quiet for several days. On the night of the 12th, a unit of the Chinese army engaged in a fierce battle with more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers from Pukewang and Maojia north of Shabutang. More than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The Japanese forces gradually became unsustainable. Subsequently, the Japanese launched a major reinforcement from Shangcuzidian and counterattacked the Chinese. The Chinese army met them with a counterattack. The fierce battle continued until dawn on the 12th, and both sides are still facing off. (13th Telegraph)

### The Sixth Session of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council; Effective Measures for Joint Defense in the Yikezhao League Agreed Upon; The Mongolian Political Supervisory Group Determined to Establish It Soon

Yulin: The Sixth Session of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council opened on the 5th and closed on the 7th. Deputy Chief Executive Zhu Shouguang, who was sent to Mongolia to provide guidance, had already returned to Yulin on the 10th. He stated that since the Fifth Session of the Mongolian Political Council, the matters to be promoted by the council have been fruitful due to the efforts of Council Chairman Prince Sha, Standing Committee members Rongxiang, Prince Tu, Prince E, and others. The Sixth Session of the Council, based on factual needs, reviewed the past, cleared up backlog cases, planned for the future, and built up governance. Matters such as implementing joint defense to strengthen self-defense forces, increasing production to stabilize economic life, and promoting education and organizing the people are all urgent tasks that have been properly discussed and will be effectively implemented. Rongxiang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Mongolian Council, also made a statement after the meeting, saying that the issue of joint defense in the Yikezhao League is extremely important. Security teams in each banner are stepping up training and maintaining close contact. Due to geographical factors, the banners have had little contact in the past. If joint defense can be implemented, not only can local security be guaranteed, but also the worries of the front-line troops can be reduced. Effective measures have been agreed upon at this session. The previous session of the council decided to organize a Mongolian Political Supervisory Group, and this session decided to promote its early realization, because in this way, the administration of each banner will easily step onto the right track. During the session of the Mongolian Political Council, a public memorial service was held at the Suding Holuo for the swords and spears left by Genghis Khan. The ceremony was extremely grand, and each banner of the Yikezhao League sent representatives to participate in the memorial service. There are a total of eight large and small swords and spears of Genghis Khan. When the spirit tablet of Genghis Khan was moved, they were also moved to Gansu. Later, because the Mongolians regarded these as sacred objects to stabilize the Mongolian banners, they were returned from Gansu this year and are still enshrined in Suding Holuo. This sacrifice was the first major ceremony since the return, so the Mongolian citizens were particularly excited, and the sacrifice was also very enthusiastic. (11th Telegraph)

### The Hong Kong Government Has the Right to Control Labor

Hong Kong: One of the most important plans in the Emergency Defense Regulations is to authorize the government to control labor. Therefore, the government now has the right to prevent any employee from changing their profession, or to order any employee to change from this profession to another profession, and to prevent strikes or factory shutdowns. This plan, which is the same as that implemented in Britain, can ensure that when it is necessary to fully mobilize its resources in Hong Kong, experienced employees will not be wasted on occupations that are not essential or that they may not be suitable for. The government also hopes to establish arbitration tribunals and use other plans to prevent work stoppages due to industrial disputes. (Reuters Telegraph, 14th)

### Molotov Returns to Moscow; Germany and the Soviet Union Reach Understanding; Lengthy Talks with Hitler Again

Berlin: Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov left here this morning to return to Moscow. The communiqué did not specify what was discussed. It is generally believed that what Mr. Molotov discussed with Hitler and Ribbentrop must be a very complex issue, or even, as the National Zeitung claimed, the formation of a world alliance jointly dominated by Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan to resist the British Empire. When Mr. Molotov was preparing to leave, a sincere expression of farewell from those seeing him off at the Anhalter Bahnhof also indicated the importance of this meeting. The importance of this historical fact may soon become clear. Molotov, Ribbentrop, Chief of Staff of the German Army Keitel, Chief of the Political Police Himmler, and Prussian Police President Daluege arrived at the station in the same car. The line of guards immediately stood at attention and saluted. At that time, the military music played in unison. Mr. Molotov shook hands with the German military and political officials one by one to say goodbye. Then, he and Ribbentrop walked to the front of the train and talked for a few minutes. Before the train departed, Mr. Molotov repeatedly shook hands with Ribbentrop before boarding the train. The special train departed from the station, which was covered with German and Soviet flags, amid music. (United Press dispatch from the 14th)

German Side Remains Silent on Content of German-Soviet Talks

Berlin: A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry gave a speech to journalists from neutral countries yesterday afternoon, stating that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop entertained Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov on the evening of the 12th, which was very pleasant. Regarding the content of the talks between Molotov and Hitler, Göring, and Ribbentrop, the spokesperson remained silent. He pointed out that a characteristic of German diplomacy is that newspapers do not discuss events that may or will necessarily occur, but only publish brief official reports, and avoid commenting or speculating on the content of negotiations, nor do they publish details of the entertainment of German and Soviet leaders. Well-informed German sources only announce that the information published in foreign newspapers is not accurate. It has been learned that the Soviet community in Berlin is scheduled to entertain Molotov yesterday. It is understood that Molotov did not receive diplomatic representatives of other countries during his visit to Berlin. It is still unknown whether the Turkish Ambassador to Germany visited the German Foreign Ministry during Molotov's visit. The return of the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, to Berlin is to report to the government, and the visit of the Japanese Ambassador to Germany to the German Foreign Ministry during Molotov's visit is not important, because the Japanese Ambassador maintains close contact with the German government. Regarding the results of Molotov's visit, the spokesperson remained strictly silent. Whether an official communiqué will be issued in the future has not been announced. Berlin believes that the various speculations in foreign newspapers about Molotov's visit are a strategy to probe German official information. British and other political figures are still unaware of the meaning and results of Molotov's visit, which is quite satisfactory here. (Haitong dispatch from the 14th)

Germany Attempts to Induce Soviet Union to Join Alliance

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the German Foreign Ministry, in its speculation and propaganda, has revealed the main purpose of inviting Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov to visit Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry's statement refers to the need to determine the basis for the coordination of the Soviet Union with the Axis powers and with Japan. In other words, just as Germany induced Japan to participate in the Three-Power Pact to counter American actions, it is now trying to induce the Soviet Union to join this alliance. However, the Soviet Union may not fall into Hitler's trap and restrict itself to taking any special steps according to the development of the war. As for the saying that this decision could produce an improvement in Soviet-Japanese relations, it is not absolutely impossible, because both the United States and Japan do not want to be trapped in the war and there are many issues where the interests of both sides run parallel. Although it is not easy to find any common ground regarding the situation in China, a compromise on this matter is ultimately not as difficult to establish as any of the Soviet Union's other positions in Europe, except for economic ones. Germany previously wanted to continue moving Poland's new border westward, so that the Soviet Union could occupy more land in Poland, but now it only allows land where the majority of residents are Russian. Therefore, Stalin may not be tempted now to embark on a risky policy. As for economic talks, when Germany and the Soviet Union established an agreement last year, they hoped that the Soviet Union could support Germany economically with the raw materials it promised. Now Molotov may agree to allow German experts to assist in eliminating the difficulties inherent in the Soviet economic system. However, the British attack on the Italian fleet in Taranto will definitely influence the Axis powers' discussions. (Reuters dispatch from the 14th)

Berlin: Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov left the Anhalter Bahnhof at 11:06 a.m. this morning by special train. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop bid farewell at the station. This visit, which contains historical significance, has come to an end. Molotov shook hands with German officials at the platform one by one to say goodbye, and then hurriedly boarded the train. After the wheels started moving, Ribbentrop walked alongside the train and had a final conversation with Molotov, and then shook hands again to say goodbye. The German and Soviet flags were hung high in front of the Anhalter Bahnhof. There was an honor guard and a military band in front of the station. When the car of Molotov and Ribbentrop arrived at the station, they paid their respects and played music. Molotov's entourage boarded the train in advance. Those who saw him off at the station also included General Keitel, Himmler, and other German military and political officials. (Reuters dispatch from the 14th)

Red Star Says This Trip Has the Most Important Significance

Moscow: The Red Army mouthpiece Red Star newspaper stated that Molotov's visit to Berlin is the most important event in recent times. This is the first time that a Soviet newspaper has commented on this matter. The newspaper also said that German and Italian newspapers have said that Molotov's trip is an event of first-class importance. It is undoubtedly a promotion, enhancement, and development of relations between the Soviet Union and Germany that Mr. Molotov and German policy leaders have had personal contact and exchanged opinions.

### Washington Figures Watch German-Soviet Talks; Believe Soviet-Japanese Understanding Cannot Be Established; Otherwise, It Will Cause Adverse Effects

Washington: Philippine figures and Far Eastern observers here have been closely studying the news and rumors from Berlin, because most diplomatic experts believe that the current situation in the Philippines and the position of the United States in the Pacific may be seriously affected by the conclusion of political or economic agreements between the Soviet Union and the Axis powers. Some experts say that, regarding Molotov's talks with the German authorities, no authoritative party has yet indicated that the content involved Soviet-Japanese relations. Some say that the scope of the talks has already included the Pacific issue. However, both believe that any common agreement concluded with the Axis powers will inevitably react in other areas. The Italian press, which has a background, recently stated that the Soviet Union will comply with the Axis powers' requests and enter into a complete understanding with the three Axis powers on the issue of dividing the world's scope. The declaration of the Italian official Stefani News Agency that it has established a branch in Moscow indicates that this has some meaning, because since the Soviet Revolution of 1917, Italy's establishment of a news agency in the Soviet Union is the first time. However, Chinese figures here believe that Molotov's talks with the German side will definitely not allow the Soviet Union and Japan to establish an understanding, because if the Soviet Union and Japan reach an understanding, it would be tantamount to the Soviet Union abandoning its policy of assisting China and will cause it to lose the trust of millions of Chinese Kuomintang members from now on. Philippine figures claim that if the Soviet Union and Japan conclude an agreement, the adverse effects on the situation in Southeast Asia and the China Sea will be even greater than Japan's signing of an agreement with Germany and Italy. A Soviet-Japanese agreement will allow Japan to be free from the threat of the Soviet Union on its flank, thereby allowing it to freely advance south on a large scale. However, neutral experts say that unless the right to divide China, India, or Afghanistan is used as compensation, the Soviet Union has no benefit in concluding such an agreement. (United Press dispatch from the 14th)

### French Newspapers Comment on German-Soviet Talks; Molotov's Main Purpose of This Trip Is Threefold

Dispatch from Clermont-Ferrand, France: The Soviet Union's People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov's visit to Germany has been commented on by various newspapers here. However, they have all adopted a cautious attitude regarding the results of this trip. The right-wing "White Day Newspaper" stated that Molotov's main purpose of this trip is threefold: (1) to develop the economic relations between the Soviet Union and the Axis powers, (2) to reiterate that the Soviet Union maintains a non-belligerent attitude towards the current European war, and (3) to restrain Turkey from taking any action, thereby threatening the Suez Canal and Britain's position in the Mediterranean. "All of these are the natural results of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty of August 1939." However, the most noteworthy consequence of this trip is probably to be seen in the Far East. "It would not be surprising if Stalin turned to establish an agreement with Japan after assisting China in resisting Japan, because the only goal of Stalin's policy is to delay the time. Will the 'pro-Soviet elements' in London and elsewhere finally understand this after seeing Molotov's trip? The Soviet Union is waiting patiently, hoping that Europe will be materially destroyed and the people will suffer greatly after a long war of attrition. As a result, the Communist International will enter unimpeded and achieve final victory." "Future Newspaper" stated, "Soviet diplomacy can be said to be extremely clever, and its only goal is to grasp reality and safeguard its own interests." The German radio station once compared Molotov's trip with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's trip to Moscow at the end of August last year to sign the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty. In fact, Soviet diplomacy is mainly based on "watching the changes from a position of strength," in other words, in the international struggle, it waits for the real results of various actions, and at the same time tries to share the benefits with the victor. The fact that Britain and the Soviet Union have held lengthy talks for several months but have not been able to reach an agreement is due to this reason. In short, seizing land by means of troubled waters has always been the Soviet Union's usual technique. The British authorities have failed to see this and still recognize the existence of the Polish state. They have also refused to recognize the incorporation of the Baltic coastal countries and parts of Finland and Romania into the Soviet Union, all of which conflict with the establishment of friendship between Britain and the Soviet Union. Soviet policy has not changed in any way, and it is still willing to maintain various statuses that are beneficial to itself. Its understanding with the Axis powers is due to this." "Daily Newspaper" stated, "Although Soviet foreign policy has a nature of easing people's minds, it is still an incomprehensible mystery, because behind Soviet diplomacy, there is still the Third International operating in secret, which should not be forgotten." (Havas dispatch from the 14th)

### Daily Newspaper Praises German Diplomacy

Tokyo: Chugai Commercial News stated that, according to semi-official Japanese sources, Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov's formal visit to Berlin has actually defeated the efforts of Britain and the United States to approach the Soviet Union, and it is sufficient to prove the success of German diplomatic skills by the Axis powers. Under this outstanding diplomatic victory, there are of course the inevitability of international political and economic factors and the relationship of interests. When the Axis powers and Japan concluded the Three-Power Pact, Britain and the United States propagated that the Soviet Union would be forced to abandon its pro-German policy because the Soviet Union was surrounded by the three countries, causing the relationship between the two sides to gradually become sharp. However, contrary to the wishes of Britain and the United States, the Three-Power Pact of the Axis powers and Japan has obviously improved the Soviet Union's international position. It is said that the current German-Soviet talks are intended to complete actions in the Balkan Peninsula, or that they are aimed at demarcating new spheres of influence in Europe, the Near East, and Central Asia. In any case, this historical meeting will strengthen the diplomacy of the Axis powers and suddenly improve the Soviet Union's international position, which is not difficult to imagine. At this time, Japan urgently needs to make full preparations to cope with the future situation. (Reuters dispatch from the 14th)

### German-Soviet Continued Economic Negotiations

Berlin - Foreign journalists here learned this afternoon that German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, and the chief representative of the German trade delegation, Schnurr, left here at the same time as Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, heading to Moscow, to continue economic negotiations with the Soviet authorities. Regarding foreign reports that political talks held in Berlin failed to reach an agreement due to economic issues and will continue in Moscow, a Foreign Ministry spokesman refuted, saying that the joint official statement issued by the German and Soviet governments has clearly stated the nature of current German-Soviet relations. It is also learned that the German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, is also currently in Berlin. As for whether Papen will go to Moscow to participate in the talks, it is unknown. Informed sources, in response to journalists' questions, said that the Chinese Ambassador to Germany did not pay a visit to the German Foreign Ministry regarding Molotov's visit to Berlin.

Greek Troops Occupy Heights in Albanian Territory, Main Italian Position Threatened

Athens - Today's front-line war bulletin stated that Greek troops have again advanced in Albanian territory, echoing the new offensive of British and Greek air raids on Italian bases. The Greek High Command stated this morning that the Italian side is urgently trying to dispatch reinforcements to rush to the war zone on the Greek-Albanian border, but the Greek air bombardment has greatly hampered the Italian army. Therefore, after the Greek army won a victory in attacking the Italian army in the northern region of Mount Pindus, it also occupied several heights in Albanian territory. It is said that after fierce fighting between the Greek army and the Italian garrison, the Greek forces finally seized these Italian fortresses on the heights. From this perspective, the Greek army has invaded Albanian territory, advancing to the area north of Mount Pindus and south of the Italian-Albanian base of Korytza.

London - Today, officials here declared that the British air raid on the Italian naval base of Taranto has changed the world's naval situation, so this move will be recorded in history forever. In this battle, at least two or perhaps even three Italian battleships were bombed into cripples, and four other warships were completely destroyed. The British side claimed that this courageous action has destroyed half of the Italian main fleet and has given the British Navy the power to control the Mediterranean Sea and has strengthened Britain's position in other oceans. A British naval bulletin stated that Britain's fierce attack on Italy, causing it to teeter, proves that Britain is capable of assisting Greece in its war against Italy. British Sea Minister Alexander broadcasted a speech to the entire British Empire yesterday, saying, "The consequences of the Battle of Taranto must be very significant. Not only has the situation in the Mediterranean changed, but the balance of naval power in all the world's oceans has been completely decided. On November 2, I said that I would do my best to help Greece, and now this statement has been confirmed by the Battle of Taranto." Alexander also said that when the British Naval Aviation Team achieved this miracle in Taranto, a British light fleet also launched a fierce attack on the Strait of Otranto at the same time, destroying an Italian convoy heading to Albania. The naval bulletin stated that two Italian supply ships sank, a third was destroyed by fire, and a fourth was damaged. In addition, one escort destroyer was hit. Prime Minister Churchill said yesterday that the British attack on Taranto "has caused a reaction in the naval situation around the world." (Fourteenth day, International Telegraph)

Rome - Although foreign news reported that Italian warships suffered heavy losses in the British air raid on the 11th, the Italian military bulletin only stated the previous day that one warship was heavily damaged, and then claimed that there were no other losses. (Fourteenth day, Haitong Agency)

London - The Daily News said that the British Navy's devastating blow to the Italian Navy must excite all friends of freedom in the world and disturb our enemies. The British Navy has achieved a great victory, with such a small sacrifice and such a great success. There is no match for it in naval history. Now, some people may still insist that our naval power will be limited by air power, but the British naval aircraft's attack on Taranto, which is so well defended, can be the answer. The Times also commented on the issue, saying that the glorious victory has changed the naval and political situation to the greatest extent. The Italian army, outnumbered and defeated by Greece, has now suffered such a heavy blow to the navy. From then on, the concept of invincibility held by the countries in the Mediterranean will be greatly reduced, and the impact on the future policies of the Axis powers is immeasurable. (Fourteenth day, Reuters)

### Light Tremors Occur Intermittently in Bucharest Three Times, Rescue Work Stalled

Bucharest - After the rescue work at the ruins of the Carlton Apartments was stalled last night due to fire and toxic gas, three light tremors occurred intermittently in the area.

The Romanian authorities also prevented the opening of all theaters. Rescue workers were forced to stop rescue work yesterday because toxic gas kept coming out of the residential building. It is said that no less than four hundred people were buried in the fire. Firefighters wearing gas masks are currently trying to stop the spread of the flames. (Fourteenth day, United Press)

### The Painful History of the European War (3) Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy (1) The Weak-Willed Daladier

He said, "Rest assured. I know my responsibilities during this time. I will strive to be consistent in word and deed, and I will never let you, or those who trust me like you, down."

At that time, my respect for such a person who was fighting fate and shouldering heavy responsibilities arose spontaneously. I said, "The road ahead will inevitably have thorns. If there is anything that needs to be done, I dare to be at your service."

He pondered for a while. Standing there, his eyes looking at the floor, his head slightly lowered, and his face showing a solemn expression, moved me. He said, "Listen, in a few days—not now—I will notify you. If I feel the threat is getting deeper, you can broadcast a speech to the whole country and appeal to the people. I will have all the radio stations in the country broadcast it, and I will also watch those little troublemakers who are afraid that the world will not be in chaos."

A week later, he called me again. The situation was more dangerous than before. Political troublemakers were determined to bring down the cabinet, and the Communists would launch a general strike at the end of the month. Italy's anti-French movement had begun, as a prelude to a large-scale threat. Germany was not in a hurry to fulfill the "Franco-German Common Declaration." According to the easing policy of the Munich Conference, this common declaration was an inevitable move. As for how Germany instigated Italy to stir up trouble, no one knew.

I wrote a speech to appeal to the people with great enthusiasm. On the 23rd, I did not show the original text to Daladier, but only informed him that it was scheduled to be broadcast at 8:30 pm on the 24th.

He replied, "This evening, I will attend a banquet hosted by British Ambassador Chamberlain, but this does not matter. We will definitely be able to listen to the grand remarks together at that time."

The people of the whole country expressed a warm response to my appeal. Although the Communist Party had some criticisms, I received hundreds of letters, filled with sincere words of love from all over the country—small clerks, elementary school teachers, workers, and farmers. Later, the speech was printed into hundreds of thousands of pamphlets and distributed to all parties. I firmly believe that this helped Daladier's position in the country and that the failure of the national general strike on November 30 must be attributed in part to this resolute appeal speech.

On November 24, the strike instigators had done a lot of work and were in a predicament.

Workers all over the country received strike notices, including officials and railway employees. The Germans hid behind the scenes, not making a sound, waiting for the development of the situation. The pressure exerted on Mussolini by the fascist extremists had exceeded his own limits, and they had issued aggressive slogans on the eve of the French general strike. They demanded the seizure of Tunisia, Corsica, Savoy, and Nice in France.

I couldn't help but feel worried: I hope Daladier will not soften like he did on January 7. If this general strike succeeds, all Europeans will see that France is on the verge of collapse, and disaster will come before the end of the day.

Two days before the general strike, Daladier issued an order. All railway workers were mobilized, and those who left their posts without authorization would be subject to military law. All officials of government agencies, large and small, who did not go to the office on the morning of November 30 would be fired. At that time, all places will be filled with military police to prevent any accidents.

But I knew that there were many cowards in the cabinet who were begging Daladier to "talk" with the Communist Party leaders. If this were the case, the situation of June 6-7, 1936, would inevitably be repeated today. I thought that there must be a strong-willed person by Daladier's side to encourage him so that he would not succumb. On the evening of the 29th, I wrote a short note to him, which read:

"Prime Minister: Your Excellency's perseverance is admirable. All facilities are excellent. Please persevere to the end and do not shake it with minor matters. Fortunately. Tomorrow at 11 o'clock, I will come to wait for your teaching, breaking the silence, and the word is set, no need to reply."

The next day at 11 am, I ran to Daladier's office. He stood up from behind his desk to greet me, with a radiant face and unusual composure.

He showed me the documents spread on the table and said, "Qiu Roman, I will not relax a step. Now that the difficulties have passed, victory belongs to me. Here is a statistical report. The proportion of strikers is really laughable. They have failed miserably in this matter. Just now, a friend who lives in the Turnerko district reported to me that the workers are working very hard." He couldn't help laughing when he said this.

He went on to say: "Fortunately, I did not listen to the advice of those cowards. You think, yesterday afternoon, I asked a cabinet member to come here to ask me to consult with the leaders of the Communist Party instigators. You know, I did not accept their opinions. Now I want to be generous. For the culprits, I will not pursue the past, and within the possible scope, I will only fire a few people. That's it. And I will solemnly warn the employers not to use my victory as a shortcut to dismissal."

Da [blank space] Di was able to not be overwhelmed when victory was in his grasp and to treat them with generosity. I felt that his greatness was indeed unattainable.

Afterwards, my feelings for Daladier became more and more harmonious. I didn't like to disturb people when they were working hard—because I was also a busy person—I rarely met him except when necessary. But if there was a meeting, it was always pleasant.

In April 1939, I was preparing to go to the United States to attend the World Writers' Congress. Before leaving, I visited Daladier and asked him if there was anything he wanted me to take to the United States.

He said, "Please tell the Americans that we must not immediately drag the United States to fight with us. We only hope that they can help us eliminate the crisis of war. These are all honest words, and you can tell them as much as you like. If you see President Roosevelt, you can say the same to him. He is very clear about everything."

Then he said to me in a secret tone, "President Roosevelt hopes that we will not have any disputes with Germany in the next one, two, or three months, so as not to give Hitler an excuse to invade. He thinks that these months are a dangerous period for the European democratic countries, because from a military point of view, the gap is still too fast, and it must be supplemented by a rapid catch-up."

Daladier at that time was一心[一心] hoping to maintain peace, similar to the eve of the Munich Conference. (To be continued)

### After British Escort Convoy Was Attacked, Six More Escaped, HMS Jervis Bay Sunk

London - British armed cruise merchant ship HMS Jervis Bay recently encountered a German ship while escorting a convoy in the Atlantic. It sacrificed itself to save most of the ships in the convoy from being sunk. Only 65 of the brave crew of HMS Jervis Bay survived. They have all landed in Canada and were not seriously injured, but the remaining crew members are expected to have no hope of survival due to the deteriorating weather. The official announcement recalled the battle, saying that HMS Jervis Bay was hit not long after the battle. Although it was half out of control and burning fiercely, it still followed the captain's will and fought the enemy for an hour, preventing the enemy's artillery fire from turning to shoot at the dispersing ships. HMS Jervis Bay sank three hours after encountering the enemy ship. The naval bulletin stated that six more of the convoy's ships that escaped have safely arrived at the port.

### German Planes Attack England, Foiled, Four Shot Down

London - Although the weather was bad last night and unfavorable for flying, German planes still attacked London for as long as three and a half hours. Axis planes also made dive-bombing attacks on British ships off the coast of Scotland. According to coastal observers, British anti-aircraft guns shot down one German plane. As German planes flew from the Calais area across the English Channel to England, British coastal artillery was firing long-range shells, fiercely bombarding the German invasion bases along the French coast. (International Telegram, 14th)

Berlin - According to senior military personnel, supplementary comments on the German military report stated that German planes continued to bomb England and were not affected by the bad weather, and that the activities of British planes were hindered. London was bombed day and night, and a gas plant and several warehouses in the Kensington area were hit. During the night raids, German planes bombed seaports and other areas, causing violent explosions and fires. Railway factories in Selby, south of London, were hit, and fires broke out in Dover. Various places in Sussex were also bombed. German planes also attacked Liverpool, Birmingham, and the aircraft industrial center of Coventry. The railway tunnel at Holstane was destroyed by low-flying German planes, and important railway lines were blocked. The Brighton power plant was destroyed, which greatly affected the national defense industry. The laying of mines in British seaports is an important part of Germany's counter-blockade plan and is continuing. (Haitong Telegram, 14th)

London - Yesterday, German planes attempted to attack several places in England, but four bombers were shot down. A Ministry of Aviation communiqué stated that few places were hit, and there was very little material damage and few casualties. Enemy planes attempted to sneak into London and eastern England to drop bombs at night but were all driven back. Yesterday's German attacks were intermittent, and the all-clear was sounded soon after. During a short all-clear period, a few bombs fell. A communiqué from the Ministry of Internal Security stated that a few bombs fell on a coastal town in Kent on Wednesday afternoon, damaging some private houses and shops, with minor casualties. A few people were also killed in the Midlands in the afternoon. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)

Berlin - This afternoon's German military report stated that a German submarine sank five enemy merchant ships with armed equipment (28,840 tons). German planes bombed important military and transportation facilities in London. Military targets in Liverpool and Coventry were also bombed. Aircraft fields and arsenals near Birmingham and arsenals in southern England were also bombed. German planes attacked a convoy twice, first sinking a transport ship weighing 6,000 tons, and another merchant ship was damaged. The second hit an 8,000-ton freighter, which exploded immediately because it was likely carrying explosives. German long-range bombers destroyed a British freighter. British planes flew into German territory, but their attempt to attack Berlin was foiled due to intense anti-aircraft fire in Berlin, and only a few bombs fell in the suburbs. One enemy plane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire last night. Two enemy planes were lost yesterday, and three German planes went missing. (Haitong Telegram, 14th)

Berlin - Yesterday, German planes attacked London and southern England, breaking through cloud cover to bomb coastal factories and stations. British planes engaged, and one Hurricane plane was shot down by German planes. Another Hurricane plane and a Spitfire plane were also severely damaged and likely crashed. Only one German plane did not return. (Haitong Telegram, 14th)

### British Planes Attack Berlin During Banquet of Important German and Soviet Officials, Foiled by German Anti-Aircraft Fire, Only Dropping Bombs in the Suburbs

Berlin - Last night, a group of British planes raided Berlin, which the German side called a deliberate "disruption" of the formal banquet at the Soviet Embassy. Molotov was hosting Ribbentrop and other high-ranking German officials at the Soviet Embassy after two talks with Hitler. However, Molotov's banquet was not significantly disrupted. The enraged German anti-aircraft fire prevented British planes from reaching the center of the German capital. Molotov, his diplomatic corps, and German guests all sat quietly in the reception room of the Soviet Embassy after the banquet. At that time, the sound of anti-aircraft guns could still be heard from time to time. It was said to be Molotov's first experience of a real air raid. According to German sources, Molotov will leave for Moscow today, carrying new proposals to Stalin, requesting the Soviet Union to give concrete cooperation to the "New Order in Europe and Asia" proposed by Italy, Germany, and Japan. It is generally expected here that the primary result of Molotov's visit to Germany may be that the Soviet Union will try to make Turkey change its military obligations to Britain, thereby changing its overall attitude towards the Axis powers in the Balkans and the Near East. However, political observers believe that both Germany and the Soviet Union intend to continue to keep the details of the Berlin talks absolutely secret until the results of Molotov's visit to Berlin are announced. Today, German newspapers continue to report on Molotov's activities in Berlin in a superior position, but refuse to comment. (International Telegram, 14th)

Berlin - Several British planes attacked Berlin last night, but were unable to enter the city due to intense German anti-aircraft fire and only dropped bombs in the suburbs and left. (Haitong Telegram, 14th)

London - Last night, British bombers attacked several targets in German territory, including several places in Berlin. This was the 30th time British planes attacked Berlin. British aircrews traveling to and from German territory last night experienced extremely bad weather, and the German planes that attacked England last night were also affected by this weather. According to a Ministry of Aviation communiqué, when British planes bombed Berlin last night, they fiercely attacked the Shali Xuesheqiao Station, the Geluo Warte freight yard, and targets in the city center, causing fires. Other locations bombed included the Cologne power plant, the Duchibao and Ruhrte shipyards, the factories in Dumont and Dusseldorf, the oil refineries in Qiersen Qake City, Hanover, and Liuna, all of which were heavily attacked by the British, causing major explosions. British planes also attacked aircraft fields in Hamstedt and northern Berlin, and the seaplane base in Notna. Bombs were dropped on the shipyards of Calais and Wilhelmshaven. Only two British planes did not return. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)

### To Curb Threats, America Must Aid China and England. American Banking Tycoon Warns Japan, Advises Against Heading Down "Path of Disaster."

New York - American banker Lamont warned Japan in a speech last night that it is heading down a "path of disaster," the result of Japan's shift towards military conquest over the past decade. However, Lamont emphasized that it is not too late for Japan to turn back and seek peaceful policies. Lamont, associated with Morgan Company with significant investments in Japan, spoke as a friend. World affairs necessitate Japan to adopt a realistic attitude. He believes the Japanese people do not desire war with America. Japan's war in China has depleted resources, leading to frequent taxes and shaking gold supply. As a director of American Copper Company, he stated America should continue aiding Chongqing to resist Japanese aggression, and also aid England. "As long as Britain can fight, Japan won't dare attempt more. Preserving Britain's resistance and maintaining its Atlantic patrols are critical for America and the Western Hemisphere. Thus, a steady supply of materials to Britain is the best way to curb Japan's threat." Lamont urged the US government to promptly define its Far East policy, noting that once policy is announced, US industry is prepared to follow. He stated the welfare of the Dutch East Indies and Singapore is deeply connected to America. Regarding the Axis Powers, he stated, "Japan gains little from collusion with Germany. Now is the time for Japan to improve its dwindling economic strength. For Japan's sake, it should quickly turn back from economic exhaustion. Japan should abandon national superiority and the 'New Order in East Asia' in the Far East." Lamont added, "Japan must understand that China will be free and independent, and has a bright future. China needs a friendly, not an aggressive neighbor." Lamont wishes Japan and China to cooperate in the Pacific based on friendship. He advised Japan to be cautious, which should not be mistaken for appeasement. Lamont concluded that China's determination to expel Japan is "unshakable," and China should receive more American material assistance. (United Press Telegram, 14th)

### Fujian Education Director Zheng Zhenwen Discusses Recent State of Fujian Education (Part 1): Higher Education Cultivates Technical Talent, Social Education Utilizes Mobile Instruction

(Yongan Correspondence) Fujian education has entered a new stage since the July 7th Incident. Recently, Education Director Zheng Zhenwen released a summary of the province's implementation and trends in higher, secondary, national, and social education, recorded as follows:

Higher Education

To improve public health and cultivate medical specialists, the Provincial Medical College was founded in July 1937 and renamed the Provincial Medical Institute in autumn 1939. Its facilities were strengthened, and a pharmacy department is planned for next year. To cultivate local governance talent, the Law School of the Provincial Fujian University was established. To cultivate agricultural technology talent, the Provincial Agricultural College was established. The former was merged into National Xiamen University by order of the Executive Yuan, and the latter has already started classes.

In recent years, there has been an insufficient supply of teachers for secondary schools in this province. Therefore, in addition to expanding the Music Training Class into the Provincial Music College to cultivate a large number of music talents, a Secondary School Teacher Training Institute was also established, with divisions for Chinese, History and Geography, Mathematics, and Physics. When necessary, divisions for Education, English, Natural History, Drawing, Manual Arts, Physical Education, and Scouting will be added. Graduates from senior high schools or their equivalents will be recruited to study for two or three years, and upon completion, they will be qualified to be teachers in junior high schools and simplified normal schools. Classes have already begun.

The Fujian Provincial Research Institute was established in this province last year. The institute originally planned to have five departments: Natural Sciences, Agriculture, Industry, Society, and Medicine and Health. The Natural Sciences Department was established first, creating groups for Geology, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Meteorology, and investigating and researching the geology of the province. Recently, the Medicine and Health and Industry Departments have also been established. Regarding subsidizing impoverished college students, this province holds a scholarship examination for impoverished students every year. After the war, for those who were unable to continue their studies due to the impact of the war, efforts were made to subsidize tuition fees every year. This year, the "Measures for Scholarships for Fujian Students Studying in Public Colleges and Universities Outside the Province" were established to ensure that Fujian university students studying outside the province would not have to drop out of school.

Secondary Education

In recent years, this province has actively reorganized secondary education in accordance with the guidelines set by the Ministry of Education. The proposed zoning measures for middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools have been approved by the Ministry of Education. In terms of the number of schools, there are currently 95 public and private middle schools in the province (20 complete middle schools, 2 senior high schools, and 73 junior high schools), 17 vocational schools (15 senior vocational schools, including one senior commercial school newly established this year, and 11 junior vocational schools), and 12 normal schools (1 general normal school, 9 simplified normal schools, and 2 kindergarten normal schools). Starting next year, it is planned to add seven county-level junior high schools and six county-level vocational supplementary schools, which have been approved by the recent Second Local Autonomy Implementation Conference. This is in terms of school establishment. Regarding the improvement of middle school instruction, the overall planning and enrichment of production and scientific equipment, attention to the guidance and practice measures of vocational schools, the determination of the high agricultural school site and farm, and the enrollment of electrical and mechanical engineering students at high technical schools are all important measures in secondary and vocational education. As for normal education, there are detailed regulations on the establishment, staffing, teacher training plan, improvement of instruction, enrichment of equipment, training of in-service teachers, removal and training of unqualified teachers, wartime service of normal school students, and the combined management of social education, in-service training, inspection, assessment, and performance assessment of normal school teachers. Within the next year, 3,500 students will graduate from various normal schools, and the supply of teachers for national education in the next year should not be insufficient. In addition, the third resolution of the National Education Committee on raising the salaries of normal school students has been amended and passed by the general meeting. In the future, the difficulty of recruiting normal school students can also be broken. (To be continued)

### Minister Chen Discusses Subsidy Measures for Meals of Faculty, Staff, and Students of National Schools

(Chongqing, 13th) Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education spoke today on the subsidy measures for the meal expenses of faculty, staff, and students of national schools, as follows: Since the outbreak of the war, schools in the war zones have been disrupted. In order to continue the education cause and maintain the studies of young people who have lost schooling in the war zones, the Central Government ordered colleges and universities to move to the rear and start classes. It also established national middle schools and Zhongshan middle school classes to accommodate middle school students. Furthermore, due to the interruption of the economic resources of poor students in the war zones, special loan measures were formulated. Most poor young people were exempted from dropping out of school. The amount of the loan was originally set at seven or eight yuan per month. Later, due to different prices in various places, appropriate adjustments were made at any time. In September of this year, the highest amount has increased to eighteen yuan, and this month it has increased to twenty-five yuan. Recently, Generalissimo Chiang and Vice President Kong have been concerned about the living conditions of faculty, staff, and students of various schools. The Ministry of Education has formulated subsidy measures. For faculty and staff of national schools, if the market price of rice exceeds 50 yuan per stone, a subsidy will be allocated uniformly. For poor students in war zones and students in national normal schools, the meal loan amount will be calculated at two dou and one sheng of rice per person per month. When the market price of rice in each place exceeds 90 yuan per stone, the excess loan amount will be determined by each school based on actual needs and reported to the Ministry for approval. The actual amount will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for additional allocation. As for self-funded students in national schools, if the monthly meal expenses per person exceed 18 yuan, the excess amount within the approved standard for meal expenses for loan students in the same place may be requested by the parents from the school for a subsidized meal loan if the family is unable to bear it. After review by the school and approval by the Ministry, the full amount or half of the excess amount may be granted to provide relief. These measures have been approved and implemented by the Executive Yuan. Currently, the meal problems of various schools should be resolved as a result. In recent years, students in various schools have strived to be thrifty with their meals, and their nutrition has often been insufficient, but they have still been able to work hard and encourage each other to strive forward. This spirit is a manifestation of the increased sense of responsibility among young people since the outbreak of the war. In the future, I hope that students of various schools will appreciate the government's care for young people and the maintenance of education, and deeply remember the hard lives of the soldiers at the front and the people in the rear, so as to strengthen their efforts and strive for academic success, without failing expectations. I hope that faculty and staff of various schools will understand the difficulties of the times and continue to train and guide young people with the spirit of serving education in the past. The future of education truly depends on it.

### Shaanxi Province Establishes Political Academy to Assist Out-of-School Youth

### Female Youth Poverty Teachers Loans-Many Applicants

### The Rice Market's Unpredictable Fluctuations: Foreign Rice Flows Continuously, Causing a Brief Decline, While Speculators Remain Resolute in Forcing Prices Up

Rice merchants and speculators are heavily manipulating the market. Fortunately, foreign rice continues to arrive. Jardine Matheson's "Ewo" vessel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday with a definite amount of foreign rice. The exact number was not available due to the holiday, as previously reported. Yesterday, an investigation revealed that the ship carried 1,994 bags. Yesterday, the same company's "Fu Sheng" vessel arrived from Hong Kong, also carrying 7,859 bags of foreign rice. Both ships docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The Chinese-owned Wah Lun Shipping Company's "De Dat" vessel entered the port early yesterday morning, according to schedule, and docked at the Hongxing Wharf. It carried over 57,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon and has begun unloading. The French company's "Harding" vessel is also transporting rice from Saigon to Shanghai and is expected to arrive today. (Source: Zu)

The foreign rice market saw a slight easing yesterday. The rumors spread by speculators in recent days have been proven false, and the supply is continuously arriving. In addition to the nearly 100,000 bags arriving in the last few days, goods en route and futures contracts being loaded will also arrive in Shanghai one after another. The arrival of American rice has also not been interrupted. Furthermore, foreign firms in the central market are taking advantage of the high prices to sell off large quantities of spot and futures contracts. Upon hearing news of extended exchange rates, confidence weakened, and many speculators rushed to sell. At the same time, actual buyers mostly stood by and watched, creating a situation of only selling and no buying, causing the market to appear extremely weak. Prices fell all the way until near the market close, when some activity occurred due to lower prices, and the market appeared to stabilize slightly. However, the closing market price was still more than one yuan lower than the previous day. In the afternoon, the sellers spread rumors again to support prices, and the market price briefly rebounded by over one yuan. However, this was offset by the continued selling pressure from speculators. In the end, the result was still nearly one yuan lower than the night before. For example, Red Pagoda No. 2 Saigon rice fell from 68.70 yuan to 66 yuan in the morning, then rose to 68 yuan in the afternoon, and then fell again to 67.50 yuan at the close. No. 2 spot rice opened at 79 yuan in the morning, November rice was at 77.50 yuan to 77 yuan in the morning, then rose to 78 yuan in the afternoon, and December rice was at 75 yuan to 74.80 yuan in the morning, then rose to 76 yuan in the afternoon. No. 1 spot rice was at 81 yuan. The total volume of original bags traded was 500 to 600 tons, and 7,000 bags of spot rice were traded.

Over 1,000 piculs of new japonica rice, tea-seed wild rice, etc., have also arrived. As foreign rice weakened and people lost confidence, the market became sluggish. Furthermore, much of the arriving rice was of poor quality and could not be stored for long. As a result, sellers were eager to sell, and prices fell by about one yuan. New japonica rice opened at 92 yuan per original bag, then 89 yuan. Sold per picul by volume at 86 to 87 yuan. Wild rice at 90 yuan, green seed per picul at 85 to 86 yuan, Du Jian rice at 80 yuan per original bag, and mid-quality rice per picul at 75 to 76 yuan.

Glutinous rice was also sluggish and sales were poor, so the price also fell by about one yuan. Yi Li special grade opened at 81 to 82 yuan, mid-quality at 80 to 79 yuan, and Hong Kong white glutinous rice at 76.80 to 74.20 yuan.

### Flour Sales Turn Quiet: Two Bags of Flour, Reportedly Imported

The flour trade has become quiet. The price of No. 1 flour from the factory remains at 17 yuan. The two factories released over 8,000 bags, which is sufficient for daily needs. However, the price of returned old-brand flour has fallen after the rice price rose and then fell. It is also rumored that the first batch of Ping flour has already been imported, amounting to over 30,000 bags, transported from Shanghai by a certain postal ship. This has inevitably dampened confidence, causing the market to shift from tension to calm. Due to the above reasons, speculators are hesitant to touch foreign flour. High-brand foreign flour has returned to 19 yuan at customs, and the discounted price is 18.50 to 18.60 yuan. A small amount has been traded on the street, only 200 to 300 bags.

Wheat trading is also unremarkable. Due to the limited arrival and inventory, apart from a transaction of Wuxi wheat the day before yesterday, there have been no further transactions. The Japanese factories are only receiving a few dozen to a hundred bags each day, and the price of Huai wheat remains at 21 yuan. The market is difficult to develop for the time being.

### Manipulating Soybeans: Unable to Resist the Prevailing Trend; Both Inbound and Outbound Soybean Volumes Are Significant

The soybean market, which was subject to environmental influences the day before, was briefly disrupted by speculators and showed signs of improvement. However, it was ultimately unable to resist the prevailing trend, and the excitement quickly dissipated. Yesterday, oil prices continued to weaken, and the supply was continuous, leading to quiet buying and a sudden drop in prices. As a result, the price plummeted by one yuan compared to the previous day. Only 120 bags of Tianjin soybeans were traded on the street at a price of 37 yuan, and 200 bags of Huapi soybeans were traded at a price of 36.80 yuan.

Yesterday, 500 bags of soybeans arrived from Tianjin. Today, 800 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Xiamen, 320 bags to Hong Kong, and 1,200 bags to Singapore. 200 bags of raw peanuts are being shipped to Hong Kong, and 520 cans of raw oil are being shipped to Xiamen, along with 100 packages and 1,000 cans to Hong Kong.

Securities

### Domestic Bonds Rise and Stall; Foreign Stocks Are Actively Sold

The unofficial securities market saw prices rise twice yesterday, but failed to maintain their position and instead trended downward. Investor sentiment is clearly weak. Many bulls are overcrowded, and current holdings are constantly flowing out, leaving the bulls unable to resist. Selling pressure is high. The three companies, Tongkang, Lianhe, and Xie Kang, were the most active sellers throughout the morning and afternoon. Other companies, such as Xie Xing, Yuan Tong, Shun Tai, also sold a significant amount. As a result, Yongchang, Jiu Feng, Yi Yu, and others made strenuous efforts to push prices up. Class C shares were briefly seen trading at 2.60 yuan in the morning but quickly fell back. In the afternoon, Lian Yi, Shun Chang, and No. 4 again raised Class C shares to 2.50 yuan, but they once again declined due to excessive selling pressure. Class C shares nearly broke the 2 yuan level. After several rounds of competition, the sellers remained dominant. As a result, prices uniformly fell by 0.15 to 0.40 yuan. The trading volume was 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Regarding stock trading, 50 shares of Dasheng Third Cotton Mill were traded at a price of 31.50 yuan.

The weakness of the stock market yesterday was due to (1) a slight sense of instability in the current situation, (2) numerous unfounded rumors, and (3) a shift towards looser foreign exchange rates. Opening prices were low and continued to fall. Although new buyers and short-covering investors were active throughout the day, the market was unstable and many retail investors sold. However, buyers were dominant at the close, perhaps because everyone felt that the prices of various stocks had fallen too far. Rubber stocks and industrial stocks also declined.

London, 13th (Wednesday) - Telegraph: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Eastern British Company stocks remained stagnant. Only Kulak Limpang Rubber shares rose 7.5 pence to -4 shillings and 4.5 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Speculators Selling Foreign Exchange All Day

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC list prices remain unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates trended looser throughout the day. Negative rumors were rampant, and people were uncertain. However, speculators sold throughout the day, and short-term investors decreased. Foreigners' purchasing power was weak, so the American exchange rate was close to the 6 yuan level, reaching 5.96875, with a large volume of transactions. As a result, both British and American exchange rates loosened by 0.046875 and 0.09375, respectively. British gold was calculated at 3 pence and 78125, and American exchange at 5.9375 yuan.

The American Exchange Rate Approaches the 6 Yuan Level Again

At the beginning of the morning, London's large contracts, both near and far term, fell by 0.0625. New York banks remained stable. The price of London raw gold was fixed. Exchange rates between Shanghai and England, Shanghai and the United States, etc., remained unchanged. Exchange rates between the United States and England in Shanghai, etc., were also stable. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the start of trading, the bank's spot selling price was 3 pence and 71875 for British gold and 5.84375 yuan for American exchange, compared to the previous day's closing. British exchange tightened by 0.03125, while American exchange did not change. However, after trading began, due to unanimous selling by Chinese merchants and speculators, the market already showed signs of loosening. Speculators were selling this month's American exchange at 5.875 yuan, and Huahang and others were also offering the same month's American exchange at 5.875 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced as unchanged. The silver balance tax was lowered by 0.5%. After that, Japanese banks sold off, and the position became more abundant, causing the price to continue to loosen. Currently, Japanese banks are selling American exchange to American banks at 5.90625 yuan. The shilling also became firmer, and British banks, etc., entered the market offering this month's exchange at 3 pence and 75. Furthermore, telegrams from Hong Kong offered to sell at almost 3 pence and 765625. As a result, spot British gold closed at 3 pence and 75, and American exchange closed at 5.90625 yuan.

Negative Rumors Are Again Prevalent

The selling trend gradually intensified in the aftermarket. Speculators continued to sell, and there was also some kind of negative atmosphere. Speculators sold this month's American exchange at 5.9375 yuan, and there were also beneficial transactions with foreign banks for the same month's American exchange at 5.96875 yuan, and next month's at 5.9375 yuan. However, speculators bid to sell at 5.96875 yuan. The final closing prices for American exchange, both spot and futures, were 5.9375 yuan, and British gold spot and this month's were 3 pence and 78125, and next month's were 3 pence and 765625, which was 0.046875 looser for British gold and 0.09375 harder for American exchange compared to the previous night.

### Swap Day; Gold Market Sees More Selling Than Buying; Bulls Post 5 to 10 Yuan

Yesterday's spot gold informal market saw a sharper decline. Foreign exchange rates fluctuated between loose and tight from morning to night, and negative rumors were rampant. Gold market operators also uniformly switched to selling. The lowest gold price reached 5,600 yuan. Today is swap day. It is rumored that money changers are posting 5 yuan, and later gold and silver shops posted up to 10 yuan. The final figure was in the range of 7 to 8 yuan. The closing price for futures trading was 5,668 yuan, a decrease of 74 yuan compared to the previous day. The total trading volume was approximately 3,000 taels. Gold ornaments at silver shops ultimately listed a decrease of 10 yuan, while customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Spot Gold Drops by 74 Yuan

At the beginning of the morning, sentiment was calm, and prices were extremely stable. Gold and silver shops traded 20 taels, opening at a price of 5,745 yuan. Later, upon hearing that the exchange market was slightly firmer, gold and silver shops aggressively sold, pushing the price below the 5,700 yuan level. Gold and silver shops sold 20 taels to gold shops at 5,680 yuan. Fortunately, gold shops, money changers, etc., took advantage of the low prices to buy, pushing the price back above the 5,700 yuan level. Money changers purchased 30 taels from securities firms at 5,720 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange rate continued to strengthen, and sentiment was further affected by negative rumors, there was a tendency toward weakness, with more selling than buying. After prices fell, it was difficult to recover. Gold and silver shops sold 20 taels to gold shops at 5,670 yuan. Before long, the price continued to fall by more than 10 yuan, dropping to 5,655 yuan. Gold and silver shops sold 20 taels to gold shops. By noon, the market remained mediocre. As a result, gold shops sold 10 taels to gold and silver shops at 5,670 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the market initially weakened. Gold and silver shops traded 10 taels at 5,655 yuan. As the foreign exchange rate continued to fluctuate between loose and tight, retail investors aggressively sold, driving the price down to 5,600 yuan. Later, securities firms intervened to maintain the price, raising it to 5,670 yuan. Gold and silver shops purchased 10 taels from gold shops. However, soon after, gold and silver shops sold 20 taels to gold shops, lowering the price to 5,650 yuan. As a result, gold and silver shops traded 10 taels at 5,668 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening, a decrease of 74 yuan compared to the previous day. The range of fluctuation for the entire day was 145 yuan. The quoted price for gold at cash shops was more than 10 yuan higher than the spot price, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current margin was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the quoted price for gold, and there were few transactions.

Gold Ornaments Listed 10 Yuan Lower in the Afternoon

The selling price for gold jewelry in silver shops was unchanged in the morning. At 2:30 pm, the price was listed 10 yuan lower. Datonghang was quoting 580 yuan, and the new Tonghang was quoting a similar price. The purchase price was about 30 yuan lower.

### Foreign Currencies Ultimately Weaken

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slight weakening in spot gold prices. Both British and American gold pounds also fell by 0.50 yuan. British gold notes remained unattended, and the market price remained fixed. American gold notes initially rose to 16.80 yuan, but then, due to numerous rumors, the market price suddenly fell. The evening market retreated to 16.57 yuan, which was 0.10 yuan lower than the previous day. Hong Kong notes followed the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate, falling by 0.01 yuan. The trend for Japanese gold notes remained weak, and the evening market retreated to 1.525 yuan. Korean notes saw balanced supply and demand, and the market price remained stable. The evening market remained at 1.18 yuan.

Coal

### Coal Briquettes Did Not Continue to Rise

The day before, various newspapers reported that the factory price of coal briquettes had risen by 8 yuan, from 144 yuan to 152 yuan. However, after reporters inquired with industry sources, it was stated that this price was actually the market price for resale on the street (7.60 yuan per dan, which is equivalent to 152 yuan per ton), and the news was a result of inaccurate transmission. As for the factory price, the Huichang Factory is still selling at the original price of 140 yuan, and there has been no further increase, in order to avoid increasing the burden on citizens.

Yarn & Cotton

### The Yarn Market's Fluctuations Depend Entirely on Gold and Exchange Rates

The yarn market continues to be weak, with a slightly weaker trend. This is due to the activity of speculators. The gold syndicates specialize in following trends and exploiting opportunities. Their intention is to proportionally expand and contract the market based on the rise and fall of foreign exchange and gold. As a result, market transactions are quite active, with sudden purchases and sudden sales, causing uncertainty and instability. However, the major players in the industry remain calm and inactive. However, current sales have decreased compared to before, because there were many purchases the previous day. In short, short sellers are active again. Today, 10 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Xiamen and 560 bales to Hong Kong.

The morning market for spot yarn was strong because the afternoon atmosphere the previous day was particularly high, and there were no other unexpected changes. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,258 yuan. At this price, sellers were very active. Shortly after, it fell to 1,252 yuan. Then, due to purchases by bulls and short covering, it rebounded to 1,265 yuan. Subsequently, upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate had lengthened and the price of gold was weak, speculative selling surged, and the market gradually fell to 1,243 yuan. Once the low price appeared, profit-taking sellers and those with shorting intentions took the opportunity to buy, pushing the price back up to 1,255 yuan. Around 12 o'clock, upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate continued to lengthen, the situation suddenly loosened, and the price fell to 1,242 yuan at the close. According to statistics, the total volume traded during the half-day was 6,160 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 12 yuan. The amount of purchases from various groups is listed as follows:

Industry insiders 5,950 bales; Hong Kong 20 bales; Total 6,160 bales.

### Cotton Mills Experience Clogged Stomachs

The current cotton situation is slightly sluggish. This is because the yarn market is weak, and people's confidence is affected. However, sources of supply from various places remain difficult to obtain and cannot be opened. However, the mills' stomachs are also clogged, so the market situation is also wandering in an ambiguous state.

The market price of foreign cotton is as follows: The New York cotton market is quiet. Initially, overseas merchants sold, and then there was some short covering. As a result, closing prices for near-term contracts rose by 1-2 points, while prices for far-term contracts fell by 2-3 points compared to the previous day. India's Lian Co. predicts a drop of more than one rupee.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai remains extremely quiet. Factories have not released cotton yarn recently, so purchasing interest is weak. Industry insiders believe that the inventory of spot goods on the market is not abundant, so they are unwilling to sell the spot goods in their hands. As a result, the cotton market has remained quiet in recent days.

Piece Goods

### Both Inbound and Outbound Cotton Cloth Are Scarce

Yesterday's factory cloth market trended stable, with all parties watching. Both inbound and outbound volumes were scarce. Sales from commercial agents remain undeveloped. Wholesale from local and domestic areas saw a slight increase in demand, and transactions were relatively frequent. Grade 84 original cloth, due to shortage, was uniquely popular, with each bolt rising by 0.25 to 0.50 yuan. Coarse cloth, grey cloth, and colored cloth were firm. Fine cloth and twill saw a decline of 0.25 yuan per bolt. Total transactions included over 400 pieces of grey cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and colored cloth. From eastern Zhejiang and Ningbo, 100 plus pieces of blue cloth, colored cloth, and coarse and fine cloth. From Guangdong and Hong Kong, over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. Two thousand bolts of colored cloth and bleached cloth from overseas resettlement areas. Piece goods exports on the 15th included 37 pieces to Xiamen, 1,320 pieces to Hong Kong, and 210 pieces to Singapore. In addition, 55 pieces were transshipped from Singapore to Rangoon, and 14 pieces were transshipped from Hong Kong to Rangoon.

Eastern cloth initially rose and then fell, and the situation remains weak. 12-pound fine cloth for headscarves opened at 36.12 yuan, showing a slight increase. But as the yarn price weakened, it immediately fell again, reaching 35.67 yuan at the noon close. Post-market fluctuations were minimal, and the closing price was 35.65 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge was around 1.09 yuan.

### Uniform Serge Is Used for Women's Overcoats

Domestic uniform serge has been selling well recently. Because Melton wool is expensive and rotten serge is also high-priced, lower-grade women's overcoat serge, suits, and uniform serge for large and small batches of clothing have all been changed to this uniform serge. Navy blue is selling even better. Yellow is only suitable for military and political needs, and due to dyeing issues, its selling price is actually 0.30 to 0.40 yuan more expensive than navy blue. Domestic merchants and those from the Beijing-Hangzhou line are all wanting to purchase it, but the inability to transport it is a regret. Yesterday, Zhanghua uniform serge was sold wholesale at 9.50 yuan per yard, Renli at 10 yuan net, and Hualun double-width at 4.25 yuan.

Sugar Market

### The Foreign Sugar Trade Is Quiet

Yesterday, the grain market was quiet due to the weakening of foreign exchange rates and the decline in investor confidence. At the association's bidding, the spot price for two or four coarse white sugar at the local warehouse was 73.50 yuan, a decrease of nearly one yuan. The asking prices for other sugars, such as Taikoo car white sugar, were also looser, but no transactions took place. The local factory offered 150 bags of iced flower sugar at a price of 66.50 yuan, slightly lower than before. High-grade goods are still lacking. Today, 50 bags of sugar are being shipped to Xiamen.

Dried Fruits and Nuts

### Long Red Dates Offer New Crop

The first batch of new-crop long red dates arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, in small quantities. Yesterday, 48 bags were offered at a price of 28 yuan in cash, which can be said to be a low price among red dates. The market situation is stable.

Hardware

### Factory Nails Are Slightly Tighter; Wire Rod Remains Sluggish

The factory price of wire nails has been sluggish in recent days due to poor sales of wood and abundant spot goods. The market situation has been rather quiet, and the market price has been extremely weak. However, since the day before yesterday, due to a sharp reduction in factory production, market goods have gradually been sold off, and transactions have shown some activity. As a result, industry insiders have tightened their asking prices. Yesterday, each keg of Best brand nails was sold for 55 yuan, which is about 2 yuan higher than before.

The current market for wire rod is particularly sluggish due to the sharp reduction in the sales of nail-making factories. In addition, commercial agents' sales have also been stagnant, resulting in abundant market goods and an oversupply. As a result, standards are still falling. Currently, the asking price is still 53 yuan per dan, but there are still few transactions.

Fourteen days ago, 425 pieces of copper arrived from Hong Kong.

Medicinal Materials

### Hawthorn Slices Arrive in Another Batch

A second batch of new-crop hawthorn slices has also arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, samples were seen, and the quality was acceptable. A total of 100 bags were immediately offered at a price of 45.50 yuan, which is not much different from before. The trend is stable.

### Although Fennel Has Risen, There Is a Lack of Transactions

Fennel has risen in price due to a lack of arrivals and dwindling market inventory. Initially, it rose from 280 yuan to 300 yuan. Recently, it has become even tighter and has risen to 305 yuan and 310 yuan before stabilizing. Although industry insiders have raised their asking prices, there have been no firm transactions.

Seafood

### Tapioca Flour Continues to Rise

The tapioca flour market has already seen an increase in prices. The source of supply remains quiet, and spot goods are gradually becoming scarce. The trend is tightening. Currently, market prices are 73 yuan for the Flying Unicorn and Human Gun brands, 72 yuan for the 3X·KG brand, 61 yuan for the Anchor and Peacock TT brands, and 48 yuan for No. 3 flour, which is about 1 yuan higher than before.

Couple's Knowledge

### Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor; Dr. Zhan Nianzeng, Venereal Disease Specialist, Co-authored; (Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road; (Hours) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM; Closed on Sundays; The Discrepancy Between Performance and Physical Health Creates Tragedy Between Couples

Smart girls know that a man's physical health is a guarantee of their happiness after marriage. Therefore, they are extremely careful when choosing a spouse, hoping to find a satisfactory lover. Especially in European and American countries, the general trend is that young girls are fascinated with pursuing male athletes and sportsmen, which is all the rage. Indeed, there are not a few among them who have found ideal matches, lived in a close and loving relationship after marriage, and experienced boundless happiness. However, there are also many cases where things do not go as planned, and tragedies occur between couples. The reason for this is the discrepancy between performance and physical health.

We study zoology, botany, and human eugenics and know that those with vigorous development often experience a decline in reproductive function. Those with vigorous reproductive function often experience a decline in development. Therefore, a person with well-developed physique does not necessarily have healthy sexual performance. In addition, men engaging in strenuous exercise are not necessarily suitable for their bodies. Therefore, there are many fake sportsmen and athletes who are strong on the outside but weak on the inside.

It is true that genuine sportsmen and athletes, as well as other generally robust men, have reduced fertility due to excessive development. However, if they marry a beautiful and graceful woman who can arouse their deep love, the transformative power of love can soon enhance their fertility. The worst situation is when a man has engaged in self-gratification and nocturnal emissions in his early years, or suffered from sexual indulgence, excessive worry, and injuries after marriage, which has devastated his sexual function, resulting in spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, small genitals, thin and infertile sperm, and neurasthenia. Then, although his appearance is majestic, he is practically useless, and completely powerless in the sexual life that is the foundation of the marriage. If the man has already had a rude awakening, then all is lost. But how heartbroken is the woman who has waited expectantly during her beautiful youth! Therefore, love breaks down, and tragedies often occur between couples. In today's social news, cases of spring boudoir grievances, wives sacrificing their youth, unwilling to resign to their fate, committing adultery and eloping, or even filing for separation or divorce from their husbands are not uncommon?

A smart husband who wants to repair the missing part of the sky must fundamentally cure his illness. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the most effective treatment is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germenon." This preparation is made from gonadal hormones extracted from chimpanzees, sea dogs, etc., and replicated using scientific methods. Therefore, it is of high quality and potency. After taking it, it can generate sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, invigorate the blood, and nourish the nerves within one day and night. With continued use, it can completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time and can also achieve the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth. However, those who experience spermatorrhea must also take "Dr. Yemituo's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to strengthen the seminal vesicle and stop leakage, so that both the root and the branch can be treated and the effect will be faster.

### Leaving Uncured Spermatorrhea Will Endanger Life: Venereology Specialist Physician Zhan Nian-zeng

The semen within an adult man's body is, in reality, the source of our life. If, unfortunately, during the period of burgeoning sexual desire, due to masturbation, erotic thoughts, debauchery, excessive indulgence, and other reasons, the sexual nerves that govern sexual function are weakened or become hypersensitive, then spermatorrhea is almost unavoidable. However, if spermatorrhea is treated early, it will not cause great harm. If one delays and is perfunctory, allowing it to go untreated, waiting until the essence is exhausted and the blood depleted, and the development function is hindered, then one will present with a short stature, a small sexual organ like a finger, a decline in metabolism, and the three major nerves of the brain, spinal cord, and sex organs will be destroyed. Then, brain degeneration and forgetfulness, occasional distending pain, insomnia and excessive dreaming, mental distraction, back pain, limb fatigue, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation and impotence, thin semen and infertility, premature aging, and other symptoms will follow one after another. This kind of youth not only has no hope in academics and career but also cannot fulfill the minimum requirement of continuing the family line in married life, causing resentment from the wife, or no offspring, leaving lifelong regret! Moreover, because of accumulated weakness and multiple illnesses, many end up dying early!

According to world-renowned physicians and my own experience, the only treatment for spermatorrhea is to take "Schimitt's Semen Consolidating Pills," which is the most effective remedy. This medicine, when taken, immediately consolidates the seminal gate and calms the nerves, thus spermatorrhea can be cured. If spermatorrhea has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Germinal Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuous use will surely lead to a complete cure in a short period of time and can also achieve the effect of prolonging life. If patients can come to our clinic for diagnosis by a specialist physician and receive appropriate treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

### Health and Beauty: Breasts are the Lighthouse in the River of Love. American Medical Doctor Yao Chong-pei

If a woman has a slender waist, full buttocks, and a pair of tall and elastic breasts, swaying gracefully in front of her chest, then even without wearing luxurious clothing, but only a thin cloth cheongsam and light makeup, she will be graceful and moving, making those who often see her feel soul-stirring and regard her as a celestial being. If she further applies lipstick, draws curved eyebrows, perms her hair, and wears leather shoes, and fully reveals the beauty of her curves when moving like willow leaves swaying in the wind, with a rosy face radiating a charming smile, such a woman not only gains advantages and favor everywhere, but also enjoys limitless love and happiness in her private life with her husband, like a magnet attracting iron!

However, such healthy and beautiful women are still a minority in the world. The main reason is that a woman's ability to attain such health and beauty depends entirely on the full health and beauty of her ovaries. If the ovarian function is unfortunately affected by leukorrhea, anemia, menstrual irregularities, or severe illnesses, leading to a loss of health and affecting metabolism, then the breasts that govern a woman's health and happiness will wither and itch, resulting in a haggard appearance and slender buttocks. Such women are not only often disliked by their husbands in the family and have difficulty conceiving, but also tend to be stubborn, narrow-minded, melancholic, and sentimental in their personal temperament. The gods of happiness and joy have no connection with them. Therefore, the tragedy of their future fate is unimaginable. To seek remedy, one can only rely on science. According to world-renowned gynecologists such as Dr. Constance Nan and my own experience, it is universally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation "Germinal Hormone" for women is the most effective remedy. This medicine, when taken, can nourish ovarian function and invigorate metabolism within one day and night. Continuous use will ensure the complete cure of the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time, causing the breasts to gradually rise and transforming ugliness into beauty.

### US Consulate Spokesperson Clarifies True Intent Behind Evacuating Nationals; Once an Economic War Begins Between the US and Japan, Transportation Convenience May Be Completely Blocked

In order to clarify the original intention of the State Department's order to evacuate nationals, the spokesperson of the US Consul General's Office explained to reporters yesterday that the government does not exert any pressure on the evacuation of US nationals in Shanghai. Most Americans are citizens who love freedom, and there is no question of coercion. The State Department's evacuation order is entirely advisory in nature. Most US nationals, considering that war between the US and Japan is unlikely to occur in the near future, disregard the State Department's order. However, former US Acting Consul General Buttrick clearly pointed out in the notice sent to US nationals in this city that the real danger lies in the economic war between the US and Japan because once an economic war begins, transportation convenience may be completely blocked.

Two Thousand US Nationals Decide Not to Evacuate

According to reliable statistics, there are a total of four thousand US nationals in this city. After the third national evacuation transport departs from Shanghai on the 21st of this month, only about three thousand people will remain in Shanghai. Among these three thousand people, about two thousand have expressed their intention to stay in Shanghai, while the remaining one thousand or so will continue to evacuate gradually. Some are currently trying to find extra berths on the President liners that are already fully booked. It is learned that a few will take ships of the Changxing Company and the Japan Mail Steamship Company, while the rest will have to wait until next spring for the opportunity to evacuate.

Conflicting Opinions on the Issue of Leaving or Staying

According to an employee of the American President Lines, most of the US nationals who intend to evacuate do not have a definite opinion. Most people seem to be waiting for the development of the future situation before deciding whether to leave or stay. It is believed that there will be many disputes within US national families regarding the evacuation issue. Men mostly wish to have their wives and children evacuate as soon as possible for their safety, while women mostly do not want to leave their husbands and return to the US so quickly.

Washington Liner Still Has Many Vacancies

The Washington, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai on Sunday afternoon, has received applications for cabin reservations from 518 passengers to date, but there are still vacancies in the first, second, and third-class cabins. Regarding the future arrival of the Manhattan, there is no news from the local side. At the same time, the President Taft is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 19th of this month and depart the next day. The President Cleveland is expected to arrive here on December 9th and depart on the same day. It is said that the cabins of these two ships are already fully booked, but it is also learned that there may be possibilities to accommodate a small number of extra passengers.

Refugee Hospital Likely to Be Reorganized

The American Refugee Hospital at 37 Bailinan Road, West Shanghai, is run by American clerics in the city. It is well-equipped and charges low fees, so its business is developed and it is a savior for the generally poor and sick. It is heard that the hospital is facing increasingly deteriorating conditions in West Shanghai, and that American nationals in the city are not evacuating, nor is it able to make permanent plans. After recent discussions by the board of directors, there has been a decision to reorganize it, to be jointly run by international figures, and to be realized by the end of this month. Detailed information is still unknown.

British Nationals in China to Hold Annual Meeting

Secretary Baker of the Federation of British Nationals in China announced yesterday that the association will hold its annual meeting on December 4th, at which time Mr. Arnold will serve as chairman, and Mr. Davidson, chairman of the Wartime Efforts Subcommittee, will report on exciting experiences. The subcommittee used private raffles to obtain a profit of 250,000 yuan, which will be donated to the British government's defense funding.

### Salvation Army to Shelter Beggars; Plans to Set Up Shelters to Take in All Street Beggars

The Shanghai Times reports that the weather has turned cold recently, and the number of street poor who have died from hunger and cold is gradually increasing. Various charitable organizations are now urgently preparing to provide assistance to the poor this winter, fearing that the impoverished class will have difficulty getting through the harsh winter. According to reliable sources, the Shanghai Salvation Army is currently drafting a plan to set up a shelter to broadly accommodate all street beggars.

Providing Food and Clothing The method will be similar to the Salvation Army's shelter for indigent foreigners, which was previously run on Xiamen Road, accommodating seventy foreigners of twenty-five nationalities. It is heard that some philanthropists are currently planning to film the tragic situation of Shanghai beggars for the purpose of publicity for charitable organizations in the city. Charitable work centers in the United States have paid close attention to the news from Shanghai that the poor are

having difficulty getting through the winter. According to the opinions of those in charge, the difficulty of the poor lies in the ever-increasing cost of living, and some factories have reduced production due to the high cost of raw materials, which may lead to an increase in unemployment. The Shanghai Salvation Army once sent trucks to distribute hot meals in the streets, and it is hoped that this will not be necessary this winter because if the proposed shelter is established, there will be no need

to distribute meals along the way. The cost of setting up this shelter is estimated to be huge, but with the support of all sectors of society, this plan will not be difficult to realize. The Salvation Army also plans to send young and strong beggars back to their hometowns, and in the shelter, to help drug-addicted beggars break their addiction. For young beggars, they will be taught how to make a living.

### British Information Office: Reception for the Press; Hodder Arrives in Shanghai from India to Lecture on the Current Situation

The British Embassy Information Office in Shanghai, considering that Mr. Hodder, the Indian affairs consultant of the Far East Bureau of the British Information Department, recently came to Shanghai after a survey in India, and to enable the British expatriates in Shanghai to understand the situation of India and the domestic situation amidst the current turbulent situation, especially invited Chinese and foreign journalists and expatriate leaders to give a public lecture at the Embassy Press Reception Office at No. 28, the Bund, Beijing Road, at 4 p.m. yesterday. More than a hundred people attended. First, the director of the office gave a brief introduction, and then Mr. Hodder stood up and talked about the recent situation in India for more than an hour, explaining the current situation in India in detail, with many warnings. Some of the guests asked questions, and Mr. Hodder also explained them one by one. It was not until 5 p.m. that the event ended.

### Coastal Ports in Zhejiang Province Suddenly Completely Blockaded; Japanese Tax Commissioner Notifies Jianghai Customs to Stop Closing Customs at Five Ports Including Gu'ao

Foreign ships sailing along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian have changed their routes to ports that are not blockaded. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side has also prevented foreign ships from sailing on routes not within the blockade range. Now, Jianghai Customs has received a notice from the Japanese Assistant Tax Commissioner that, starting yesterday, all foreign ships sailing to the following five ports will be suspended from closing customs, including: (1) Gu'aotou, (2) Songmen, (3) Haimen, (4) Shipu, and (5) Shacheng. Except for Shacheng, which belongs to Fujian, the rest of the ports belong to Zhejiang Province. Since the two ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province were banned, foreign ships have been sailing to Gu'aotou and Haidou. Now, four ports are closed at the same time, and there are no ports in coastal Zhejiang that can be used for navigation. Therefore, it is virtually a complete blockade. However, the Fuqing line in Fujian still closes customs as usual.

### Another Japanese Officer Shot in Hongkou Yesterday; Assassin Fired Four Shots and Fled the Scene; Situation Confused After Japanese Alert

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", another shooting of a Japanese army officer occurred in the Japanese-controlled area of this city this afternoon (the 14th). At 1:20 p.m., Japanese Army Sergeant Ishibashi was walking near the Jiashing Road Bridge in Hongkou when a Chinese assassin suddenly fired four shots from behind. The Japanese officer was hit by two bullets in the eyebrow and slightly injured. He was sent to Tongwen Hospital, and the assassin fled. Afterwards, the situation in Hongkou was chaotic. The Japanese authorities immediately set up a cordon around the shooting site, completely blocking traffic in the area.

### Case of American Ship Detained; Still Awaiting Japanese Reply; No News Since Detention; Missionary Died After Previous Obstruction

According to the English-language "Associated Press", the American vessel "Estelle L", weighing 250 tons, has been detained by the Japanese navy off the coast of Zhejiang since November 2nd. The U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Lockhart, protested to the Japanese consulate last week. Today (the 14th), the reply from the Japanese side is still awaited. It is reported that the only American vessel sailing along the coast of China is the "Estelle L". It sailed from Ligang on the second of this month and was soon stopped by a Japanese warship. Since then, there has been no news from the ship, and the Japanese authorities have not announced the reason for detaining the ship. According to reports, when the "Estelle L" carried some missionaries from Wenzhou to Shanghai several months ago, it was detained by the Japanese naval authorities. At that time, a sick British missionary, Ms. Smith, was on board, intending to go to a hospital in Shanghai. However, the Japanese side deliberately delayed the ship for a long time before allowing it to sail to Shanghai. Ms. Smith's treatment was delayed, and she died not long after being admitted to the hospital.

### Part of U.S. Marine Corps to Leave Shanghai Next Week; USS Chaumont Arrives Yesterday; USS Guam Sails to Wuhu

The U.S. Navy transport ship USS Chaumont arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday and berthed at the British naval pontoon on the Yangjingbang. The transport ship will stay in Shanghai for four days and is scheduled to return to the Philippines next Tuesday (the 19th). At that time, a partial replacement unit of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in this city will take the ship back to the Philippines. It is reported that after the transport ship transports the Marine Corps in this city back to the Philippines, it will return to the United States. In addition, the U.S. Navy Asiatic Fleet shallow-water gunboat USS Guam, which was berthed in Wusong, sailed out of the port at dawn yesterday and went up the river to cruise in the Wuhu area. The U.S. ships in the port include the USS Pillsbury and the new transport ship USS Chaumont, which arrived yesterday. It is not known when the USS Guam will return to Shanghai.

### Sino-U.S. Trade via the Yunnan-Burma Road is Fast and Efficient; China Assigns Special Vehicles; The U.S. Dispatches Special Ships

After the adjustment of trade between China and the United States, good results have been achieved. Due to the interruption of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road, a new route had to be opened. Since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, the Chinese government, in order to fulfill the barter contract, has transported huge quantities of tung oil, bristles, tungsten ore, and tea to the United States via the Yunnan-Burma Road. The raw materials supplied by the United States to China are also transshipped from Rangoon to China. In the second half of October and November, Sino-U.S. trade has seen a surprising new development. China has designated a number of trucks to travel on the Yunnan-Burma Road, specifically to transport goods from the United States to China and from China to the United States. The United States has dispatched special ships to travel between Rangoon and the United States, specifically to load goods.

### Japanese Public Buses Attempt to Extend to Nanshi; Japanese Newspapers Claim Concessions Have Agreed; Shanghai Municipal Council Refuses to Comment Yesterday

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", the Japanese newspaper in this city reported today (the 14th) that the Huazhong Urban Public Bus Company, a Japanese company operating public buses in the northern part of the Public Concession, is considering extending its Hongkou bus lines to Nanshi. The authorities of both concessions have agreed to the opening of this new route.

Japanese Companies Exclusively Occupy Northern District Business

However, according to a Shanghai Municipal Council spokesman this morning, the Municipal Council has not received any application from the Japanese side regarding this new route. The spokesman refused to comment on this matter and did not say what attitude the Council would take if it received such an application. The Huazhong Urban Public Bus Company operates 230 buses in the northern part of the Public Concession and has never paid a single penny in license fees to the Municipal Council. Its drivers also do not hold permits from the Shanghai Municipal Police. The lines in the northern district were previously operated by the British-owned China General Omnibus Company and the Shanghai Electric Construction Company, which had obtained special rights from the Municipal Council and still pay full license fees. However, the business in the northern district has now been exclusively occupied by the Japanese.

### Safety Campaign: General Mobilization in All Sectors; Highly Effective Last Year; Hoping Businesses and Residents Will Strictly Comply with Instructions

The Safety Campaign, launched by the Public Concession and the French Concession for one week, will begin next Monday. As reported in previous newspapers, the reporter went to the General Traffic Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday to find out the details, as follows:

In addition to the Western Radio Station, which will be broadcast by Deputy Inspector Pike, China Radio Station has also agreed to broadcast two types of safety records during the period.

Entertainers Zhang Yizhi, Liu Ziyun, Li Zhuan, Huang Zhaolin, Dong Tianmin, etc., have also agreed to promote vigorously on the radio or in venues, in the hope of reducing road accidents.

During the period, there will be thousands of high school and middle school students wearing armbands, guiding pedestrians, drivers, cyclists, rickshaw pullers, etc. at major intersections, and distributing various leaflets. As many as eighteen middle schools will participate.

The new film produced this year was completed by the Traffic Offices of the two concessions and the famous director Xia Wancang. It was previewed at the Grand Shanghai Theater on the 10th of this month. It is reported that there are two films, one long and one short. The long one is 1,500 feet long and is prepared to be shown in two-screen theaters and factory open spaces. The short one is about 700 feet long and will be shown in theaters such as Cathay, Grand Theater, Dahua, Grand Shanghai, Kinmen, Huguang, Jincheng, and Xinguang.

The 28 large flags donated by Ailan Toothpaste Company will be hung at major intersections in the two concessions during the period, in the hope of reminding citizens to pay attention on the road.

The Traffic Office sent letters to various large companies, foreign firms, and businesses last week, asking for assistance and advising their staff to be careful during Safety Week and not to have accidents, and to be equally careful on the road in the future, in order to achieve results. The major companies on Nanjing Road will post large safety posters during the period, including five eye-catching pictures.

Car owners, car owners, and truck owners in the two concessions will receive letters requesting assistance, as well as windshield and side window stickers, safety methods for drivers, and the total number of road accidents last year.

The posters on the back of public rickshaws are donated by the China Chemical Industry Society. On the Public Concession side, Chairman Yin of the Rickshaw Industry Association will distribute the warnings and leaflets on safety methods for rickshaw pullers to various car dealers and pullers.

For bicycles, the leaflets will be distributed to each person by patrolmen and students. Chairman Tang of the Shanghai Bicycle Association has agreed to vigorously promote and guide all members to abide by safety methods.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Sends Letter of Thanks for Donation to Isolated Battalion; Hoping for Continuous Self-Improvement; Bright Future is Near

Under the leadership of Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan, all the officers and soldiers of the Isolated Battalion of the Fourth Regiment, during their three years of isolated life, have not only worked hard to improve their intellectual and physical education, making the 400 soldiers improve their cultural level and develop strong bodies, but also organized the Isolated Battalion Production Cooperative, enabling the soldiers to acquire industrial skills and engage in production. Their products, such as socks, soap, and candles, are of considerable quantity, good quality, and low price, and are well received by all sectors of society. A month ago, Regiment Commander Xie specially used 500 dozen pairs of socks and 1,000 dozen bars of soap produced by the cooperative to send to the front for comfort. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation, they were converted into cash amounting to 3,361.05 yuan in national currency, which was remitted to the Comforting General Association. A letter of reply has now been received from Madame Chiang Kai-shek in her own handwriting, with many words of concern and encouragement. The original letter is as follows:

Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling's handwritten reply

"To Comrade Xie Jinyuan and all the officers and soldiers of the Isolated Battalion: The telegram and remittance of 3,361.05 yuan in national currency have been received. The money has been allocated to the National Women's Comforting General Association for use. The heroic history of the Isolated Battalion in the past is engraved in people's hearts forever. Now, in the face of a harsh environment, you are working together to engage in production, which shows self-reliance and regeneration. Moreover, you are concerned about your comrades and donate funds, which is especially commendable for your patriotism. I hope that you will continue to improve yourself and strive for progress. A bright future is not far away. I am sending a special reply to express my thanks and to wish you success. Chiang Soong Mei-ling, with a receipt attached."

### Chiang Kai-shek Assists in Ningbo's Food Crisis

The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association, in order to assist the people of their hometown with food, sent a telegram to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Our association, Mr. Ma [name incomplete], requested permission to transport Hunan and Jiangxi rice to assist our Ningbo people's food supply. A reply telegram was received from Chairman Huang [name incomplete], requesting that personnel be sent to the province. [Details unclear]. Now, we have received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which reads, '[Unclear] translated and forwarded to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Ma's telegram has been received. China attaches great importance to the food problem in Zhejiang Province. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is now coordinating and negotiating the relief efforts as a whole and has ordered them to be intensified to avoid food shortages. Sir, you have always been enthusiastic about caring for your hometown. I hope you will give practical assistance and develop local financial resources to promote progress together. Chiang Kai-shek [unclear].' Minister Weng also replied, 'Mr. Ma's telegram has been received. Regarding the preparation for the rice shortage in Ningbo, I have telegraphed the National Food Administration to coordinate the handling. I have replied accordingly. Special reply, Weng Wenhao [unclear].' I am sending this telegram accordingly, hoping that you will discuss it. Eastern part of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association."

### Benevolent Craftsman Works One or Two Extra Hours to Accumulate Nine Yuan to Help Refugees

The Shanghai Charity Federation for Disaster Relief received a donation of 9.5 yuan from Mr. Zhao Kuoming yesterday. He stated, "I am a small craftsman. I have witnessed refugees all over the streets and alleys of this city. They are suffering from hunger and cold. I cannot bear to see them. I am ashamed that my strength and heart are at odds and I cannot do anything. I try to work one or two extra hours every day to help the refugees. I have made and sold fourteen boxes of powdered figures, totaling 9.5 yuan, and I am sending them to help the refugees. I also hope that all the great philanthropists will provide more relief." Mr. Zhao, as a craftsman, has a rare concern for his fellow citizens. It is believed that there is no shortage of enthusiastic philanthropists in the world who will be inspired by his example and not let Mr. Zhao monopolize the beauty. According to reports, the powdered figures made by Mr. Zhao are not cracked or rotten. All kinds of Buddha statues and dramas are lifelike and exquisite. The characters' clothes and expressions are all artistic. It is truly a unique national craft. Mr. Yan Chuntang, the general manager of Yihua Film Company, saw Mr. Zhao's work when he was collecting materials for the film "Guanshiyin" and praised it highly. He asked to take it back for worship. Mr. Zhao's craftsmanship can be seen in general. His works are displayed in the Wing On Company and can be seen by all.

### Shanghai Banks Must Not Operate Without Authorization; Money Shops Receiving Deposits and Loans Must Register; Registered Shops Must Not Engage in Illegal Business

In order to consolidate wartime finance and strengthen the management of banking business, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Temporary Measures for the Management of Banks during the Extraordinary Period, stipulating that anyone who engages in one of the following businesses, such as receiving deposits and granting loans, discounting bills, remittance, and pawn, but does not call themselves a bank, is regarded as a bank. Anyone engaged in the above business must register in accordance with the regulations. It has recently been reported that some small money shops, silver shops, and trust companies in the Shanghai Concession area are arbitrarily engaging in banking business and do not register with the Ministry in accordance with the regulations. This is very wrong. Therefore, the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are specifically instructed to ban money shops, banks, and trust companies that have not been registered and approved for business from arbitrarily engaging in deposit, loan, remittance, discount, and other businesses. Violators will be prosecuted to protect the safety of depositors. All registered firms must not engage in illegal businesses, such as discounting drafts and illegal trading of gold. It is reported that some newly established silver shops, money shops, and trust companies have all submitted applications for registration to the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the regulations, and the Ministry is handling them fairly.

### Shanghai-Vietnam Freight Rates Reduced; Rice Prices Began to Fall Yesterday; Rice Prices Expected to Fall Further; Citizens Should Stock Up for Emergencies

Yesterday's rice market saw a surge in both domestic and foreign rice arriving in Shanghai, and speculators had no way to manipulate it. The prices of foreign rice fell by one or two yuan per unit, while the prices of domestic rice fell by half a yuan per unit due to the sluggish sales. The highest price yesterday was 90 yuan per unit. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson ship "Fushun" continued to arrive in Shanghai, carrying 7,859 bags from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf. The French shipping company "Kaiding" carried 29,500 bags of rice (mostly Pearl Rice) and arrived in Shanghai today. The "Jindian", which arrives in Shanghai on the 19th, also carries a large amount of rice to Shanghai. In total, more than a dozen ships, including "Haida", "Hubei", and "Taiyuan", have sailed to Shanghai this week. The city's grain reserves are becoming more and more abundant.

Reduced Shipping Costs

It is also reported that the French Shipping Company has reduced the shipping cost from Shanghai to Vietnam by two Hong Kong dollars per unit. Therefore, the rumor spread by speculators about increased shipping costs is even more unfounded. It is expected that rice prices will continue to fall due to the abundant supply.

Continuing Price Control

According to the French newspaper, the city's Price Control Committee, despite feeling financially strapped, will continue to hold price controls to benefit the general poor. The main difficulty is the shortage of funds. It is reported that the Price Control Committee has decided to do its best to solicit donations, hoping that all sectors of the city will consider the difficult lives of the poor in winter and donate generously. Unless there are changes, the next sale of Saigon broken rice will be held in the middle of next month. Previously, the association announced that it would not be able to continue after this period, which ends on the 19th, due to a lack of funds. Recently, in view of the soaring rice prices and the urging of the press, and the attention of the Concession authorities, it was decided to continue the event.

Group Purchase Completed

The Civil Food Regulation Association's group purchase of rice, the 28th batch, was completed the day before yesterday, with a total of 1,250 bags, with a transaction price of 78 yuan per bag. As for the 29th batch, it was also completed yesterday, with a total of 1,500 bags, with a transaction price of 82.55 yuan.

### Jewish Refugees Have Nowhere to Go; Sassoon Sells Reception Center; More Than 2,000 People Have No Place to Live

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", European Jewish refugees in Shanghai are almost in a state of desperation. This morning (the 14th), they suffered another major blow. It is revealed that Sir Sassoon has sold the Jewish refugee reception center on Pingliang Road to a Japanese silk weaving company. It is reported that there are more than 2,000 refugees living in the center, and they all have to move out within two months. As for the Jewish Refugee Committee's plan to find a new place to accommodate these 2,000 refugees, there is still no news. A responsible person vaguely said that they might find a place for them near the Waibaidu Bridge, but failed to disclose where the new site is. The area near the Waibaidu Bridge is already full of vacant land and houses. The Pingliang Road reception center was originally a factory, which was slightly damaged during the Shanghai war. A year ago, it was handed over to the Jewish Refugee Committee for repairs and converted into a reception center. The decision to force them to move out is the third major blow suffered by Jewish refugees in Shanghai in less than two months. First, the Jingzhou Road reception center was returned to the Shanghai Municipal Council, leaving 1,500 people with nowhere to live. Second, the Jewish Refugee Committee recently announced a lack of funds, so the daily food supply for refugees was reduced from three meals to one meal.

### Ningbo Actively Launches Plague Prevention and Control Work

Ningbo sent another telegram yesterday, reporting on the situation of plague prevention and control as follows: Ningbo's plague prevention and control work is being carried out with continued efforts. In addition to the A-class isolation hospital, four more people have died. The Yin County Government has also issued a notice for students of all schools to be vaccinated against the plague, starting from yesterday, three times a day, to ensure safety.

### Mr. Fessenden on Vacation, Mr. Boling Acting

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is taking a short two-week vacation starting today (the 14th), and his duties will be temporarily taken over by Mr. Boling, the lawyer of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

According to another report, Mr. Fessenden left for Qingdao on the British Taikoo Company's "New Beijing" ship at 9 a.m. yesterday, and may go to Tianjin. This trip is highly valued in well-informed circles, as it actually contains a considerable task of a nature of surveying.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Invests 4 Million Yuan in Various Vegetable Markets; No Profit to Be Made; Suggest Increasing Stall Fees

According to the temporary report of the Special Economic Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the book value of the Shanghai Municipal Council's investment in vegetable markets is 4,364,000 yuan. The vegetable markets are almost entirely managed by the Health Department, but the income is not included in the Health Department's register. Last year, the total income from the vegetable markets was 269,600 yuan, and in the first half of this year, it was 140,547 yuan. As for the maintenance costs, including depreciation of buildings, etc., the total cost for the first half of the year was 140,000 yuan. The Shanghai Municipal Council's investment of more than 4 million yuan has no profit to be made. The stall fee surcharge has been changed to 50% since July. This number is not appropriate, so the committee believes that the Shanghai Municipal Council's investment in vegetable markets should have at least 6% profit. If the surcharge is increased from 50% to 100%, or the basic license fee is increased to the same amount, the Council's profit will be only 5.25%. The annual turnover of the vegetable markets is at least 40 million yuan per year. Even if the stall fee surcharge is increased to 100%, the total income of all fees will not be more than 1.5% of the total turnover. The situation in each vegetable market is different, and the increase in stall fee surcharge should be differentiated. Due to the war, the vegetable markets in the northeast are not yet back to normal, so the stall fee surcharge should not be excessively increased at present. For other vegetable markets such as Hankou Road, Fuzhou Road, Beijing Road, and Xinzha Road, business is as usual, and the increase should be larger. Finally, the committee's suggestions for the construction of vegetable markets are as follows: 1. Revise the stall fee collection rate to ensure that the Shanghai Municipal Council can obtain at least 5% profit from its investment in vegetable markets. 2. Tender for the lease of the Yangshupu and Qiqihar Road vegetable markets. 3. Strictly prohibit peddlers from approaching the vegetable markets.

### Hoping the Telephone Surcharge Will Not Be Implemented; Usage-Based Billing Has Already Increased the Burden; Company Revenue Has Increased Significantly

The Shanghai Telephone Company is following in the footsteps of other public utilities and increasing the surcharge. After it was approved by the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, it will be implemented as soon as the French Concession authorities agree. This matter is not only of great concern to tens of thousands of telephone users in the two concessions, but also of great importance to the future of commerce. According to a person in charge of a public organization yesterday, telephone users have already increased their burden a lot since the telephone company implemented usage-based billing. After the war, the population of Shanghai increased sharply, and the industry and commerce prospered abnormally. The telephone company's revenue has doubled in the past. Although there has also been an increase in expenditure, it is quite manageable. If the increase in new users is used as a reason to increase prices to show restrictions, it violates the purpose of public utilities. The residents and business community in the area are hoping that the electricity and water surcharge will be reduced as soon as possible, and that the new rule on telephone surcharge will not be implemented.

### More Cold Weather Yesterday Morning; More Than 80 People Frozen to Death; Buddhist Association Issues Porridge Tickets

According to the record of the Xujiahui Observatory, the low temperature at dawn yesterday was 2 degrees Celsius, or 35.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The weather has become severe, and the number of corpses frozen to death on the streets has increased again. According to a reporter from Daguan News Agency who inquired at Pushan Villa, the villa collected 33 male and female corpses and 48 children's corpses that were frozen to death on the streets yesterday. The winter is long, and the work of providing shelter and relief for the poor this year is very important. The various charitable organizations are currently preparing various plans, such as distributing steamed buns and setting up shelters, to provide relief.

The Shanghai Buddhist Fellowship issues porridge tickets to benefit the poor on the streets. It has now formulated expanded promotion methods and appealed to all sectors for support. The methods are as follows: (1) The porridge tickets printed by the association are priced at six cents each, which is equivalent to a bowl of porridge, and are given to the poor, who can take food with the tickets. The 28 porridge shops specially designated by the association will settle the payment with the tickets, which must be three miles away from each shop. The tickets are not allowed to be exchanged for cash or dishes to prevent abuses. (2) The promotion method of the porridge tickets is to bind the porridge tickets into a booklet of 50 tickets each, which is equivalent to 3 yuan of porridge fee, and sell them to all sectors, who can distribute them to the poor themselves. (3) It has now been agreed with the various temples to ask the patrons to promote 10% of the fees for repairing Buddhist affairs and fasting banquets. However, it is still feared that it will be difficult to be comprehensive. It is planned to ask all merchants to promote the monthly fee of 3 yuan, which has the benefit of being beneficial without being expensive, and without abuses.

Other welfare undertakings for members will also be carried out step by step.

### Robbery on Nanjing Road Gunfire Erupts at Dawn Patrol Officers Chase and Exchange Dozens of Shots One Robber Killed, Stray Bullet Injures Rickshaw Puller

Chen Cigen from Dachen, Tongzhou, who lived in Room 302, No. 138 Nanjing Road and worked as a barge operator, was having his maid open the door to wash and mend at around 5:40 AM yesterday when suddenly three robbers, two of whom were armed with pistols, broke into Chen’s bedroom. Chen was fast asleep at the time and was shocked to see the uninvited guests. His wife, Mrs. Zhuang, seeing the robbers holding firearms, knew they had encountered a violent situation, and thus

shouted "Robbers!" repeatedly. Fearing that the detectives would be attracted by the sound, the robbers turned around and fled. At this time, the司閣捕 in the alley heard the noise and slipped out to report to the nearby Chinese police and pursued closely. At the same time, the police blew the whistle, and the surrounding patrol officers gathered. Knowing that the matter had been exposed, the robbers preemptively opened fire on the pursuing patrol officers. As a result, the officers returned fire. The robbers crossed Jiangxi Road, entered Henan Road, and turned west into Jiujiang Road. Along the way, the two sides exchanged about thirty or forty shots. The sound of gunfire was incessant. One robber in short clothes fled to the front of the Japanese-owned Hechang Printing House at No. 295 Jiujiang Road,

where he was shot in the head, chest, and other places, and collapsed. The 閣捕 there then fired two more shots, and the robber died on the spot, with blood gushing out. It is reported that the Chinese police fired more than ten shots at the above location. Nearby shops were sound asleep in the early morning when they suddenly heard gunshots and were greatly startled. The dead robber was named Wang Hehong, about thirty years old, wearing a light gray short coat. A pistol containing several bullets was found abandoned on the ground. When the bullets were flying, a stray bullet hit the left leg of rickshaw puller Wang Shaoyun, who was subsequently sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The body was sent to the morgue for examination.

Robbery Assaults Chinese Police

The Qia Yu Silk Store, opened by a Mr. Chen from Huzhou at No. 18, Alley in Zhejiang Road, Public Concession, was invaded by six robbers at about 0:45 PM yesterday, three of whom were armed with pistols. They broke directly into the store's accounting room, threatened the accountants and clerks, and seized two to three hundred yuan in Chinese currency from the writing desk drawers. At that time, three robbers guarding the gate raised their firearms, and were seen by passers-by in the alley, who knew they were not good people and quickly reported to the nearby 捕. The report was forwarded to the Laozha Police Station, which quickly dispatched patrol cars to the scene. Chinese and foreign police officers bravely rushed into the store and arrested six robbers. One of the newly appointed No. 75 detectives, Sun Lianke from Shandong, bravely stepped forward to arrest the robbers, but was shot in the left rib by an armed robber. However, the robber was eventually captured, and the firearms and other weapons were taken to the Laozha Police Station for interrogation. The injured detective Sun Lianke was rushed to the patrol police hospital for treatment by ambulance.

Wang followed behind and reported to the "警" Cantonese Wei Wu (24 years old) at the Kang Gang Post. The "警" then pursued and arrested them, but was discovered by the two robbers, who retreated and fired a shot, hitting the "警" in the chest and left hand, killing him on the spot. Afterwards, Japanese military police and others dispatched large teams to surround and search Bailinan Road, Kaixuan Road, Dunxin Road, Yaojiajiao and other places near the scene of the incident, but found nothing.

### Famous Photographer Weng Feipeng Assaults Friend with Intent to Rob Valuable Camera Arrested and Dagger Found

Weng Feipeng, from Fujian, is a famous photographer whose works have appeared in various magazines and newspapers. Weng is also good at singing and participates in singing competitions, often ranking among the top. Recently, Weng, due to financial difficulties, developed evil intentions. Knowing that his friend Wang Naxi, who works at the Japanese-owned Inoue Photo Materials Store at No. 1298 North Sichuan Road, has a "Contax" brand camera (worth 4,500 yuan) and intends to sell it, Weng called Wang and said that his friend Guo Chijie

was interested in buying the camera and suggested meeting at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 6:30 PM on the 13th. Wang agreed to go on time. Weng then claimed that Guo was in Room 205 of the China Hotel on Guizhou Road and accompanied Wang to the room. They waited until 9:00 PM, but Guo had not yet arrived. Wang wanted to return to the store. Seeing that the opportunity was about to pass, Weng took out a prepared iron rod and struck Wang's head several times. Although Wang's skull was fractured, he did not lose consciousness and shouted loudly. Weng, in a hurry, did not have time to grab the camera and

fled through the door. Wang chased frantically, and detective Zhou of the Bird捕探 at Ningbo Road and Chinese警1052 chased and grabbed Weng, finding a dagger on him.

### Jesus as Lord of My Heart (3)

(3) Jesus - Lord of the Will: The will is the supervisor of the heart, the captain of the ship. In Bunyan's book "The Holy War," it is said: "My will is my master, the supervisor of the town of the soul. It decides what to do and does it, it directs all the processes of life, it makes all the important decisions in life." From this point of view, it is extremely urgent that Jesus be honored as the Lord of the Will. If we honor Jesus as the Lord of the Will, we will not be stubborn and willful, but will obey the will of God that comes from within. Some people write that human nature is a series of choices. We make choices every day, and the decisions we make sometimes have significant consequences, and the entire outcome depends on this decision. Making the right choices is extremely important, because the happiness of the entire future may depend on this one action.

The goals and plans we make are extremely important. All the consequences that arise in life depend on having goals and plans. There is no part of our being that needs Christ more than this, and no part that needs Christ as our Lord more than this. Can we hand over the rudder of our lives, the舵, to our Lord Jesus?

"Devoutly I yield all to Thee, I own no other claim;
All that I have henceforth shall be
For ever in Thy Name." (Hymns of Universal Praise, No. 313, Verse 5)

When Saul of Tarsus met the Lord on the road to Damascus, his first words when he recognized the Lord were, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" His life afterwards was based entirely on this principle, because from then on, "For to me to live is Christ..." (Philippians 1:21) Christ was his Savior, and also his Lord. His will was completely submissive to Christ from then on, so from then on he called himself "a slave of Jesus Christ." May all of you quickly hand over your entire will to Christ, follow his guidance, no longer choose for yourselves, no longer plan for yourselves, and faithfully honor Jesus Christ as the Lord of our hearts. (To be continued on the 18th)

Readers who wish to know more details should write to the Literary Evangelism Society at No. 351 Aiwenyi Road, Shanghai, and a detailed reply will be given.

### I am a High School Graduate

— Wen Zhong

Taking advantage of this calm and lonely night, I thought about it calmly, and I finally felt that: At least I am going in and out of tall 洋樓, with a long gown, a typist who stuffs three high-heeled buns every day; or a primary school teacher who can't afford the rent. I will never sleep like a ingot now, feeding bed bugs every day.

Since graduating from high school at the end of June, July followed closely. The sunshine in July radiated scorching light, knowing that the heat burning in my heart was much higher than the heat of the weather. But a month passed mercilessly, and I walked into August with a disappointed heart. …

It is already late autumn now. The torment of life is like a snake twisting my heart, and I have nowhere to vent my depression. Ah! The memories of these three months will double my pain, right?

"Would you like to work in the church? It's very idle there." My relative, Mr. Zheng, knows a certain authority in the church and kindly introduced me. One afternoon, I braved the scorching sun to visit that pastor. It was a solemn cathedral. I walked from a winding stone path to a secluded "禪堂" surrounded by flowers and trees, and met the dignified pastor. The first thing he asked me was, "Have you been baptized?" "No!" I answered straightforwardly. I often carried my grandmother's incense basket in and out of the temple, how could I lie about this? The pastor frowned, seemingly disappointed. "Do you believe in God?" "I am a non-religious person. Before deeply understanding the doctrine, I dare not say 'believe.'" "Hmm…" He turned and took a book and said, "Since you are willing to deeply understand the doctrine, take this book and read it first." My bookshelf finally had one more book, but I never turned half a page.

In disappointment, I received a quick letter from my uncle. A quick letter! I jumped up, there must be good news in this! Probably at least a clerk in a certain bank, as expected, a secretary!

It's not me boasting here, don't underestimate me, everyone, when I was a librarian at school, I was always at the top of my class, and the teachers thought I was a promising youth; especially the English teacher, I was praised by him many times.

Because it was summer and a new job, I thought it wouldn't be too early to go at nine o'clock. But after arriving there, I waited another hour and the manager still didn't come. A clerk chatted with me:

"Are you related to the manager?"

"No."

"Are you from the same hometown?"

"No."

"Are you friends?"

"No."

"Then…"

"I was introduced by a friend."

"Oh?" An arrogant and cold face appeared.

A basin of cold water splashed all over me, and my butt sat on needles that were as sharp and hard as thorns. The manager finally came, and his bloated body paced into the manager's office, followed closely by the errand boy.

The clock pointed to twelve o'clock, and the door of the manager's office was still not open. The errand boy secretly told me: "I'm afraid he won't see guests today, come tomorrow."

I slipped out the door with a stomach full of doubts and an indescribable taste.

Mr. Wang, the director of education at ×× Primary School, is a close friend of my relative. One day, I happened to meet him at my relative's house. When the topic of my future after graduation came up, he readily agreed to do his best to help, at least getting me a few hours in his school would be no problem. He also said with concern:

"But primary school teachers are very poor."

"That's not a problem, it's better than me being idle now. We are relatives, my affairs may not be easy to succeed elsewhere, I rely entirely on you."

"Easy to say, easy to say!"

After he left, our old relative revealed that he had a lot of experience in human relationships and blamed me: "That's terrible! You said something wrong! You should have said to him: 'I also want to ask you here, and I want to pull you there.' That's how you scare people. If you say honest things like you, you'll never find a job in your life." The old man's words were not golden rules, but they were, after all, worldly words. Sure enough, all the schools have already started, but there is still no news, which confirmed what the old man said.

Since graduating from school, I have moved here to live - a small旅舍. I eat outside, six 角錢 a day, and I sleep like a 兀寶, two hard boards, and the bedbugs gather at night, there is no way, I can only let them slaughter me. At that time, I always thought that I could find a job in a few days, but I knew that the reality was completely the opposite of my ideal. Now, counting on my fingers, it is exactly seven, eight, nine, three months. Yesterday I received a letter from my cousin, advising me to live at her house. Good! Taking advantage of today being an auspicious day, I will move today.

### "Abscess"

— Cao Ercang

In a recent column, Mr. Xiao Kangshi called the various ugly forms of hoarding, profiteering, licentiousness and extravagance in Shanghai "Shanghai Disease," which is quite subtle. In fact, the transformation of the isolated island into an "abscess" that breeds various diseases seems to have been going on for a long time. However, now, the state of发 is even more swollen, untouchable, and is about to rupture and fester. As mentioned in the previous article, they are all elements that make up the abscess. In this abscess, they created a beautiful environment for themselves; although this environment is so dark that it is almost impossible to see the light of day, it is enough for them to enjoy themselves to the fullest, dancing and singing.

Of course, those who hoard and profiteer, extort and deceive, kidnap and rob are all guys who happily call themselves masters in the abscess. If they can also block the road, bend their thumbs, and shout, their prestige is really comparable to heroes and heroes. However, in fact, only this kind of moldy component can "work hard" to produce such an abscess, because they have no creation, only direct or indirect destruction and disruption. In addition to this, the rest are naturally contented good people. Some are being manipulated by these moldy elements and are struggling in the throes of death; others face the dangerous environment and close the door. They are unyielding, and some even constantly do the work of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, and strictly guarding their respective posts. These are really indispensable in the abscess: when it is swollen, they kill the moldy toxins at any time, and once the abscess ruptures, they immediately create many new and powerful cells as a force for creating new muscle.

Of course, there are also those in the abscess who regard themselves as new cells, but secretly do things that are worse than blood.

This complex coexistence has formed such an abscess. It is high and swollen on the surface of the skin, and although it is proudly complacent, it is also powerless to wait for the rotting period to come. All around it are many scars, in which some are constantly flowing with light red blood, which proves that the doctor needs to make an incision; others have returned to their original state, leaving only small scars, but there are still many blood-filled toxins hidden inside, and they want to take the opportunity to make trouble from time to time.

If someone asks me, when will this abscess subside? My answer is: only when the parasitic giant, from constant effort and self-improvement, increases his infinite power through painful treatment, and completely expels these pathogens. At that time, the abscess will subside! New muscles will grow! And the giant will also enjoy true freedom!

Huo Sang Detective Cases

### The Destiny of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 11 Zhao Boxiong's Confession

Huo Sang suddenly interjected faintly: "At that time, your行动 was too reckless, you actually pushed open the movable door of the secret room. How did you forget that this kind of movable door is only half-length, and your lower body is completely unprotected? This kind of action doesn't seem like something that someone on a secret mission should take!"

Zhao Boxiong stuck out his tongue and licked his upper lip slightly, and his eyes showed an awkward look that was both smiling and not smiling. "Mr. Huo, do you know everything completely? My actions were really too flustered. Li Lan had already seen me. But I avoided it immediately, but the one surnamed Lu didn't see me."

Huo Sang said again: "He also saw you, but it was around nine o'clock, when they left Bai Mei. Later you followed them into the Shanghai Theater, your actions were much more cautious."

Zhao Boxiong said in a surprised and admiring tone: "Mr. Huo, you actually know everything completely. In that case, I don't need to say too much. After the movie ended, I followed them back to Qingpu Road. It was raining heavily at that time. In order to be careful, I didn't dare to park right outside his house. But I saw Li Lan get out of the car at the door, but the one surnamed Zhen didn't go in. When I asked the car to back up and stop three or four houses away from his residence, I suddenly saw a short person in a raincoat walking into his house. I got out of the car and quietly lay down by the short wall outside his residence to see what was going on inside.

"Mr. Huo, you can also imagine that the short person in a raincoat is his employer. Although the curtains were down at that time, I vaguely saw them drinking wine, smoking, and chatting and laughing inside, very happy. Unfortunately, I didn't see their actions completely. Because at that time, an accident happened."

Huo Sang asked: "But because the old man who guarded the door came back from the corner of Datong Road, you had to go to the west side of the open space to avoid it, right?"

Zhao Boxiong nodded and said: "Exactly, I waited for him to enter the gatehouse before returning to the outside of the short wall."

At this time, I suddenly wanted to verify what the old man had told me, and couldn't help but interject and ask. "After Lao Mao entered the gate, did he go into the main house, or did he go directly into his gatehouse?"

Zhao Boxiong looked at me and replied: "He went directly into the gatehouse. How is it?"

Huo Sang interjected and replied for me: "It's nothing. Brother Bao Lang still wants to prove the shoe prints on the floor. In fact, these prints have nothing to do with Lao Mao at all, but it is a coincidence that happened to be. Mr. Zhao, please continue." (166)

### Discussion on the Style of Drama Criticism

— Junmei

A piece of drama criticism is related to the success or failure of each performer's position, and the rise and fall of their reputation. According to a common saying of performers, "They are not afraid of critics criticizing them thoroughly, but only afraid that the critic's intentions are not righteous." This indeed shows that it has a very important force and should not be taken lightly.

The rise of drama criticism came after the emergence of newspapers in the late Qing Dynasty. However, in the short span of three or four decades, the style of drama criticism has undergone many changes. In the earliest period, drama criticism was mostly written by famous scholars and literary giants, such as Fan Zengxiang (樊樊由易哭) and others. Their works were mostly poems of praise and appreciation, not focusing on detailed evaluations. Even if they occasionally wrote scripts for performers, it was only because these famous scholars and literary giants had profound knowledge and chose some moving episodes to express their emotions. Furthermore, they praised the performers through the scripts. In the early stages, most drama criticism followed this principle. Later, Peking Opera (皮黃劇) gradually became popular, and the number of researchers increased. As a result, scholars and literati from the leisure class also gradually began to pay attention to it. From the opening performance to the end of the show, they listened carefully to every sentence and watched every scene, every hand gesture, and every leg movement. They recorded everything in detail, distinguishing between right and wrong, and providing candid criticism with very accurate observations. Therefore, drama criticism in this period was indeed valuable, and the style was simple and unadorned.

In the last fifteen years, up to the present, the style of drama criticism has gradually changed again, and there are roughly three different categories: First, it explores the principles and history of drama. In addition to having a thorough understanding of drama, such writers also have a deep understanding of various issues related to drama, either writing systematic discussions or writing excellent essays, establishing a standard for drama criticism that has a clear direction. Second, it records some anecdotes and corrections of lyrics related to drama. Although such writers are not without the suspicion of plagiarism, they promote the legacy of past performers to serve as a reference for current performers, and point out errors that the first category of writers did not have time to correct, so that performers know how to reform. This is also not without interesting aspects of drama criticism. Third, it is drama reporting. They publish drama news and snippets of performers' lives, writing engaging articles with lively language, sometimes satirizing or advising. Although it has a distinct style, it cannot naturally be excluded from drama criticism. However, there is an undeniable bad phenomenon in drama criticism during this period: the unwillingness to directly criticize. Most of the above three types of writers are unwilling to clearly point out the errors of performers or scripts, and there is a great difference compared to the bold and fair drama criticism of fifteen years ago. In today's situation where Peking Opera still needs to be improved, drama critics should perhaps consider changing their style!

### National Federation of Excellent Actors Starring in Literary Masterpiece "Home"

— Yindi

Script being written by Zhou Yibai

The film adaptation rights of Ba Jin's famous novel "Home" being acquired by the National Federation (國聯) is not only a clearing of the turbid air of folklore films but also a good sign that literary films are beginning to rise.

Currently, the screenplay for "Home" is being written by Zhou Yibai, and it is tentatively scheduled to be directed by Xia Wan Cang (下萬蒼).

Someone suggested to the National Federation authorities: "The story of "Home" is quite lengthy and can be well utilized. According to the approach of "Gone with the Wind" and "The Green Light," it can be filmed into forty reels and premiered at once, which would create a miracle in Chinese film history." Ba Jin's "Home" is the only masterpiece in the literary world in recent years, so it is highly valued, and they are prepared to spare no manpower or financial resources to engage in the filming of this film. Whether or not the above proposal is accepted is unknown, but one point has been decided and is worth mentioning, namely, in terms of actors, the National Federation will unite its excellent actors with Zhonglian (中演) for this film. Actors such as Mei Xi, Liu Qiong, Yuan Meiyun, and Chen Yanyan will all participate; in this way, we can estimate that the adaptation of "Home" to the screen may not deviate too far from our expectations.

### Li Qinian's Donation

— Guming

Before Miss Li Qinian, the Southern Queen of Film, came to Shanghai, we knew not only that she had very mature acting skills, but also that she was a new woman who was enthusiastic about social undertakings. She once took the opportunity of acting in Southeast Asia to advocate for refugees along the way, raising a lot of relief funds, so everyone respects her as a patriotic artist.

This time coming to Shanghai, she has also done much to help with charity and disaster relief. On the third day after arriving in Shanghai, she participated in the "Li Qinian Carnival" organized by the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, and all ticket proceeds were donated to the hospital's expenses. The second time was at the charity basketball game organized by the Sichuan Association Sports Association, where she participated in the award ceremony. The third time was for the Shanghai Children's Education Institute's fundraising broadcast. In the grand event where all the movie stars of Shanghai participated, she also took the time to sing, which resulted in a donation of 1,500 yuan, because that day was the best performing day.

Recently, on the anniversary of the Premier's birthday, the whole country was promoting a movement to solicit donations for winter clothing. Li Qinian also responded to this movement, and she specially donated 200 yuan as a donation, which was sent by her agent yesterday noon.

The colleagues in the film industry in Shanghai do not lag behind in anything, and hope that everyone will contribute a little effort or a little money to this winter clothing movement.

### Portraits of Female Performers

— Tang Su

(3) Lin Yanwen

A monk who has converted to Buddhism pursuing a male impersonator (坤角兒), this is a ridiculous thing: at the same time, it also shows that this male impersonator's beauty and talent are so captivating.

This male impersonator is Lin Yanwen, who is currently performing at the Carlton Theater. Yanwen's original stage name was Li Qinfang. She is a female disciple of the famous teacher Li Qinxian. She also has an elder sister named Li Yanfang, who got married many years ago, while Qinfang has never given up her stage career.

Qinfang started learning opera with Li Qinxian at the age of seven. She plays Dan roles, but she has also learned the Wusheng opera "Joining the Army and Leaving the Kiln (投軍別窰)," so she has a foundation in Qiba (起壩, a type of martial arts movement in Chinese opera). Later, she specialized in the Daoma (刀馬, female warrior) roles. "Jinshan Temple," "Thirteen Sisters," and "Mu Kezhai" are all her specialties, especially "The Great Heroic Martyr (大英節烈)," in which she cross-dresses as a man and leads an uprising against Wang Fu and others. Ordinary male impersonators wear modified armor, but she doesn't mind the trouble and wears full armor and a purple-gold crown. This seriousness is rare among female performers nowadays, and it is because she learned "Joining the Army and Leaving the Kiln."

After completing her apprenticeship, she left Li Qinxian and changed her name to Wang Jingyan. She performed at the New New Garden and the New World for many years. The story of the Buddhist monk pursuing her happened during her performance at the New New Garden's New Sound Grand Theater.

That monk was somehow fascinated by Wang Jingyan and went to see her performances almost every day. It was already unusual to find a monk wearing a cassock in the theater, but the monk's intention was not only to watch the show. One day, Wang Jingyan received a letter written by that monk. In addition to expressing his admiration for Wang Jingyan, the letter also said: The monk who is holding a fan of a certain style in his hand under the stage every day is him. In the end, he only asked Wang Jingyan to give him a reply.

"A love letter from a monk!" This made Wang Jingyan laugh in surprise, and many colleagues backstage also laughed uncontrollably, spreading it as a strange story. Naturally, Wang Jingyan did not reply to this "love letter from a monk." Later, when she was performing at the New World, she fell in love with and married Lin Pengxi because Lin Pengxi repeatedly decided to co-star with her in operas such as "Jinshan Temple," "King Mu of Zhou," and "Rainbow Pass," so she is a married woman.

When the Carlton Theater opened in the autumn, Wang Jingyan and Lin Pengxi both joined Chen Qian's (陳綫) Yifeng Society (移風社). Lin Pengxi changed his name to Pengcheng, and Wang Jingyan changed her name to Lin Yanwen. Lin is from her husband's surname. (To be continued with Chen Qi tomorrow)

### A Record of the Commercial Press's Dress Rehearsal

— Erhao

The Commercial Press's Peking Opera, which had been rumored for months and called for thousands of times, finally held its first dress rehearsal on the evening of the 10th at the YMCA Hall. In order to get a complete picture, the reporter arrived at the hall very early. At that time, the modern drama in the daytime session had not yet finished performing. It was not until 7:15 that the Peking Opera began. The stage was decorated with flower baskets and horizontal satin banners, extremely luxurious, and the whole venue was packed. There were six items on the program; the first was "Snow Cup Reunion." Mr. Yuan and Mr. Pan's costumes were appropriate for their roles; however, one sang and recited too quickly, resulting in going off-key, and the other's recitation was not stable enough. With a little more study, the flaws could be corrected. The second was "Scolding the Palace." Mr. Zhuang played Zhao Kuangyi and Mr. Wu played Empress He. Their voices were broad and able to reach high notes and low notes, and they learned the "Cheng tone" with some resemblance. The two sang accurately and pleasantly. The next was "Hongluan Joy." Mr. Wang Guozhi as Mo Ji had a kind of shrinking expression when he came on stage, fully revealing the poor state of a beggar, and Miss Ling, who played Yu Nu, looked at him affectionately and pitifully. Her appearance and figure, in their beauty and lightness, were just right for the role. Coupled with Mr. Wang's Yu Song, although slightly accented, his acting was quite amusing and added to the color. Next was Mr. Zhao and Mr. Zhang's "Lotus Lantern." Mr. Zhao played Liu Yanchang. His voice was high-pitched and his singing was quite skillful. Although he was a bit tall, paired with Miss Zhang's Du Ying, who stood tall and graceful, there was no feeling of being mismatched. Finally was "Arresting and Releasing Cao." Mr. Yang, who played Chen Gong, had a few lines of flowing water and the "Listening to His Words" section, where his pronunciation and singing were quite rhythmic; if he could study more in terms of stage steps and water sleeves, he could easily compete with famous amateur performers. The role of Cao Cao was played by Mr. Wang, formerly known as Jin Song, whose performance can be said to be natural and effortless. The grand finale was "Visiting the Mother." It started from the palace scene to the farewell scene. Mr. Shen, who played the Fourth Prince, had a dignified appearance and steady singing. Miss Ling, who played the Princess, performed even more skillfully in her second performance. Her beautiful appearance and her wonderful singing and acting were impeccable, earning endless applause from the whole venue. Overall, for a first performance, it had already achieved this result, which is quite rare. Therefore, this supplementary record is made.
