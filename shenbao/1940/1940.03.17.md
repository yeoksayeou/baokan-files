### Wei Lihuang Firmly Defends Zhongtiao Mountain; Japanese Offensive Fails Nine Times; Japanese Unable to Consolidate Positions in Shanxi; Safety of Northwestern Provinces Guaranteed; Chiang Kai-shek Awards Wei First-Class Certificate

Chongqing—Chongqing has received a lengthy letter from a certain base of Chinese forces in Zhongtiao Mountain, southeastern Shanxi Province, describing the situation of the Chinese troops defending Zhongtiao Mountain. It stated that the Japanese army feels this area to be extremely troublesome, because the Japanese army launched nine offensives, but the Chinese army still defends that mountain. Chairman Chiang awarded a first-class certificate to General Wei Lihuang, commander of the Chinese forces in the Zhongtiao Mountain area, highlighting the importance of the area. General Wei led his troops to firmly defend Zhongtiao Mountain, preventing the Japanese army from consolidating its positions in Shanxi, thus preventing them from crossing the Yellow River and attacking Gansu and Shaanxi. Therefore, the safety of the northwestern provinces is truly dependent on the ability of the Chinese troops defending this vital mountain range. This mountain range starts from Yuanqu in the east, stretches westward along the north bank of the Yellow River, and reaches Jianxi (transliteration). The defending troops are mostly Sichuan soldiers. Chinese artillery units on the south bank of the Yellow River repeatedly bombard the Japanese troops concentrated on the north bank, greatly assisting the Chinese troops in Zhongtiao Mountain. The Japanese army is currently striving to improve transportation and build roads into the mountains. Construction is underway to connect the Xia County and Anyi highways to facilitate military operations, but the Chinese army is using various methods to obstruct them. The Japanese army is also conducting propaganda in the area, distributing cartoons and newspapers. The highest peak of Zhongtiao Mountain is Lianhuatai, which is firmly defended by the Chinese army. The Chinese troops in the area are deeply confident that they will defeat all Japanese attempts to occupy the mountain or cross the Yellow River. The southeastern part of Shanxi is divided into the first and second districts of Zhongtiao Mountain. The second district is almost undeveloped, being a primitive forest with no roads and many wild animals. The first district has been developed over the past twenty years, and cultivated land with residents now accounts for sixty percent of the total area. Most of the residents in the mountains are from Henan and Shaanxi provinces. Every day, they can be seen cultivating fields on the eighty-degree slopes of the mountains. They have not been exposed to outside civilization, so their cultural level is very low. Women have bound feet and are regarded as part of the family property. Those who own many women and cattle are called rich. There are no graves to be found anywhere in the mountains. The corpses are buried underground, and grains are planted on top to avoid wasting precious land. The main agricultural products are barley, corn, and wheat. It is estimated that a good harvest in one year is enough to feed the people in the area for three years. The wheat harvest in June last year was destroyed due to the Japanese invasion. Now, most people eat corn. Sheep herding is a secondary occupation for the mountain people. On the steep mountain slopes, flocks of sheep graze leisurely, forgetting the war. Cattle are the most important possession of the farmers, with each household owning two or three heads. A calf is worth fifty yuan, while a large one is worth three hundred yuan. Their size is comparable to the water buffalo seen in Chongqing. The biggest loss suffered by the farmers in the war is the seizure of their cattle by the Japanese army to transport livestock and food. It is estimated that the farmers have lost 20,000 head of cattle in the two years of war. Therefore, when the farmers have finished planting, the Chinese military authorities help them move the cattle to safe areas. Yuncheng in Zhongtiao Mountain is a major salt production area in North China, comparable to Huaicheng in northern Jiangsu. The salt produced supplies the provinces of Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Qinghai. Mountain springs gush down, with the water containing salt. Farmers build small dams to collect the salt water and dry it in the sun. After the Japanese occupied Yuncheng, the northwestern provinces faced a serious problem of salt shortage.

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation (March 9th to 15th)

Chongqing—A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (March 9th to 15th), the Japanese troops on the northern and southern battlefields have been constantly attacked by Chinese forces and are trapped in a dilemma. The Japanese in Qiongdong, Chao-Shan, and other places in Guangdong Province have attempted to move and have engaged in extensive false propaganda in the hope of saving their failing war situation, but have ultimately failed. The Chinese are advancing bravely on all fronts. The more important aspects of the combat operations are as follows:

Guangdong Province—The fighting has been quite fierce this week. The Japanese troops invading Qiongdong by various routes were lured into the mountains and severely attacked, suffering heavy casualties. In the Zhongshan area, Chinese troops have been fiercely attacking the Japanese along the Shiqi-Guanzha and Shiqi-Beidieshi highways, inflicting heavy damage. Japanese reinforcements were counterattacked by the Chinese troops, suffering many casualties. On the evening of the 9th, Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on Xinhui along the Xinhe Road, killing countless Japanese soldiers in the Mashan, Fengshan, and Zhonggongshan areas. The Japanese rear is in a state of emergency and panic. As for the Japanese in Chao-Shan, they have been attempting to attack Jieyang along two routes, the northern route from Chao'an along Aoding Mountain, Datouling, and Guxiang, and the southern route from Anbu along Sangpu and Xiapu Mountains. They were ambushed by Chinese forces from the flanks, cutting the Japanese into several sections. The Japanese troops collapsed and retreated, and their attempt to attack Jieyang has been completely thwarted by the Chinese forces.

Guinan—The Yong-Wu Highway between Nanning and Gaofengao, and the Yong-Bin Highway between Nanning Er and Santang, are under close observation by the Chinese. Chinese troops have been attacking the Japanese for days, reclaiming over ten strongholds including Lingqi, Sanchaling, Xiziling, Tongguling, Gaobiaoling, and Daluling, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. They are continuing to attack constantly, and the area is completely controlled by the Chinese. The Japanese troops trapped in Nanning are extremely panicked. The Japanese troops who

Suisao—launched a large-scale attack from places like Pinglin Temple in the Zhihe area, consisting of several thousand infantry, cavalry, and artillery, have been under attack from Chinese forces from all directions since last week. Important strongholds like Monkey Mountain, Jiuligang, Wushan, Bailanggang, Dayanpo, Xiejiaogang, Dagudian, Lengjiawan, Dawanglong, Luoyangdian, and Guanzhuangdian have been recovered, killing over two thousand Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in disarray along their original routes. In addition,

Wuhan—near the area, a portion of the Chinese army once attacked the Japanese concession in Hankou and destroyed many Japanese facilities. The Japanese were in a state of panic.

Southeast Shanxi—Chinese troops have been using mobile tactics to attack the Japanese for days, advancing on Huguan and besieging Changzi. Many Japanese outposts around Huguan have been captured by the Chinese. The Japanese are in extreme disarray. Chinese troops in southern Shanxi have been attacking the Japanese in Houwang, Zhangdian, southeast Anyi, Ershililing, and south Xiexian for days, killing many Japanese soldiers. The fighting on both sides of the Tongpu Railway is still fierce. The Chinese have been attacking from the east and west, repeatedly cutting the railway line. The northern section is currently impassable.

North Henan—Chinese troops have once again completely destroyed Japanese transportation. In southern Henan, the Japanese forces besieging Dongwulidian in Xinyang have been dealt another major blow.

Northern Jiangsu—Over 1,300 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops from Caobaji, Daxujia, Damiao, and Pantang Village in Xuzhou have been attacking the area east of Xuzhou for days. The Chinese have been engaging in fierce close combat after encircling and attacking them, killing many Japanese soldiers. Another unit of Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on the Japanese rear, destroying most of the bridges in the area east of the artillery station on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, cutting off Japanese transportation. As for

Shandong Province—many puppet troops have been rebelling and killing Japanese soldiers for days. In the Guandong area, there are Wu Fenglin, Ma Jili, Zhu Xiangxian, Zhang Baoshan, and in the southern Shandong area, there are Li Liansan's various units, totaling over 1,400 men, with over 1,170 rifles and over 20 light and heavy machine guns. The Japanese conspiracy to use Chinese to control Chinese has completely failed. In addition,

Western Suiyuan—The Japanese troops trapped in Wuyuan have been repeatedly surrounded and severely attacked by the Chinese. In southern Hebei, the Japanese troops who attacked Qingfeng were repulsed by the Chinese, suffering heavy casualties. On the surface of the Dongliu River in southern Anhui, a Japanese giant warship was sunk and three were heavily damaged this week, posing a major threat to Japanese water transportation. This is also an important achievement this week. (16th dispatch)

Editorial

### US-Japan Economic Ties and National Relations

Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, all of its industries have been reorganized to meet wartime needs, focusing all its efforts on the manufacture of military supplies. However, Japan's domestic heavy industry base is fundamentally weak and immature. Most of the raw materials needed for military supplies are imported from abroad. Due to the neglect of production, the consumption of foreign exchange, public and private economies are showing significant fluctuations. At this time, it cannot afford to cut off foreign aid or lose the benefits of foreign trade. However, after the United States announced the cancellation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and its actual expiration, the huge benefits of trade with the United States, as well as the sources of goods for livelihood and aggression, are no longer guaranteed and are in a precarious position.

Although the United States is on the eastern shore of the Pacific Ocean, far from Japan, the two countries have always maintained the most convenient and direct sea transport trade, so the commercial relationship between the two countries is unusually close. In addition, the United States is naturally rich, its industry is developed, and its production of gold, silver, copper, iron, magnesium, coal, petroleum, etc. leads the world; its agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, and corn are also extremely abundant. Its international position originally had the view of surpassing everything; and with the outbreak of the European War, its superior situation is even more unparalleled by other countries in the world. Tracing back half a century, Japan's dependence on trade with the United States has been the greatest. Even in recent years, such as between 1934 and 1938, Japan's total exports to the United States were 260 million yen, and its total imports were approximately 450 million yen, so the import surplus reached 190 million yen, that is, the ratio of imports to exports was nine to five. During this period, the US surplus to Japan accounted for 27 percent of the total. This statistic can certainly indicate that Japan is a good customer of the United States; but in terms of the types of important trade goods, Japan's exports to the United States, except for raw silk, are not essential to the United States, such as canned food, pottery, and porcelain; on the contrary, the situation of Japan relying on imports from the United States is very different. According to recent statistics, Japan's total imports in 1936 were more than 2.7 billion (2,764,000,000) yen, of which direct military supplies accounted for 660 million yen, and its total imports in 1938 were more than 2.6 billion (2,663,000,000) yen, of which direct military supplies accounted for more than 1.2 billion (1,247,000,000) yen. Furthermore, according to the research results of the famous Japanese economist Seiichi Kojima, it is also confirmed that the United States occupies a particularly important position in Japan's overseas supply of defense industries. In terms of shipping, Japan has always been developed and has expanded greatly in recent years; it has routes west to Europe, east to the Americas, and south to the South Pacific Islands. Since 1921, the tonnage of Japanese ships passing through the Suez Canal has been approximately between 900,000 tons and 1 million tons per year, and there has been little change in recent years; while the total number of its ships passing through the Panama Canal has gradually increased from 340,000 tons in 1919, reaching a distance of 1.7 million tons by 1937. Compared to the two, the latter has made rapid progress and has indeed overtaken the former. Although Japanese ships passing through the Panama Canal may not necessarily be going to the United States, the scope of economic activity cannot be measured by the tonnage of ships; but from this, we can also see how seriously Japan's maritime transport depends on the United States. Originally, any trade between two countries must benefit both sides; but analyzing the benefits obtained, their nature is often different, and the relationship is very different. The influence and the final result are vastly different. In other words, although the trading methods are relatively opposite, the degree to which the two countries depend on each other is completely different. Taking the trade situation between Japan and the United States as an example, the degree to which the Japanese economic structure depends on the United States is much deeper than the degree to which the American economic structure depends on Japan. If the United States loses the Japanese market and the supply of Japanese goods, it will not be enough to shake the economic life of the United States. On the contrary, if Japan loses the American market and the supply of American goods, Japan will inevitably suffer a fatal blow economically. Simply put: Japan cannot lose the United States, while the United States may abandon Japan. Therefore, Japan's economic relationship with the United States needs to be actively adjusted from Japan's side.

The urgent need to adjust US-Japan relations is well known to the Japanese side; but the deterioration of US-Japan relations was initially not taken seriously by the Japanese side, and then they wanted to use lies and roars to reverse the trend of deterioration. The Japanese side does not seem to feel that the cause of the deterioration is the atrocities that began on September 18. Japan also believes that the United States' declaration to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was sudden, unexpected, and that the United States was at fault in terms of reason. Japan does not seem to realize to this day that the fundamental reason for the deterioration of US-Japan relations lies in Japan's violent aggression against China and its attempt to dominate the Far East. It should be known that since the fundamental reason for the deterioration of US-Japan relations lies here, if Japan wants to improve its relations with the United States and restore its economic function, it must revise its policy of aggression against China and stop its violent actions against China.

Observing Japan's recent attitude towards the United States, it seems that they have become slightly aware, but not thoroughly aware. They know that relations with the United States cannot be further deteriorated, and that it is best to adjust relations with the United States; but they still want to use small political and diplomatic magic tricks to shift the United States' firm Far East policy, they still want to use false threats to deter the United States' planned steps to curb violence, they still want to create smoke in China to make the United States hesitate and confused, and they still want to accelerate exploitation in China, increase national power, so as to exclude the United States and subdue the United States. Japan not only thinks so, but is already doing it recklessly in various ways. Japan is not without intelligent people, but greed blinds them. It is hopeless for them to be thoroughly aware without a real and effective head-on blow. How can they not understand that the economic pressure from the United States can lead Japan to its death; they believe that the United States has accepted Japan's intimidation, so they dare not use economic pressure.

### Japanese Failure in Cotton Planting in North China

Chongqing: According to news from here today, the Japanese cotton planting plan promoted in North China last year has been completely disrupted by Chinese guerrillas in North China. According to the Japanese plan, it was originally intended to produce 4,600,000 dan of cotton in Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces in 1939. But in fact, the cotton production in North China last year was only a quarter of the Japanese budget, that is, 1,300,000 dan. There are two reasons why the Japanese plan failed so miserably: (1) the activities of the guerrillas; (2) the farmers are unwilling to plant anything other than essential food. This is the main reason for the Japanese failure. It is also reported that the Chinese government is also collecting a large amount of cotton material in the guerrilla areas and transporting it to the interior. Furthermore, Japan originally planned to increase the rice production in North China to US$100,000,000 before 1946, so that Japan's cotton could achieve self-sufficiency.

### Body of Strangulated Fisherman Discovered in Hong Kong Waters

Hong Kong: The body of a Chinese fisherman was recently discovered in the sea, tightly bound with ropes and with his mouth stuffed. Judging from the situation, it seems that the fisherman's entire family has been killed. The fisherman had taken his wife and three children to sea to fish several weeks ago and had not returned. Only now has his body been found. Although the police are making great efforts to investigate, they have not yet found any trace of his family members or fishing boat. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

### Tianjin Silver Deposit Issue: Britain and Japan Fail to Reach Compromise, Japanese Newspaper's Report on Usage Regulations Officially Denied by British Embassy in Tokyo

London: Last night, it was learned from the British Foreign Office that the rumor that the Tokyo negotiations on the disposal of the Tianjin silver deposit had reached an agreement was not true. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

Tokyo: The British Embassy here today denied the Japanese newspapers' report that Britain and Japan had reached a "practical solution" regarding the dispute over the disposal of Chinese silver stored in the British Concession in Tianjin. The British Embassy announced that "negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo have been ongoing for several months, but important differences still need to be overcome before an agreement can be reached." It is noted that Japanese newspapers reported yesterday that after the establishment of the Wang Jingwei regime, Britain and Japan would issue an agreement on the disposal of silver, which stipulated that Britain and Japan would jointly manage the silver, with silver worth 100,000 pounds being used for relief work in North China.

### German Diplomacy Actively Seeks to Stabilize the Situation in Southeastern Europe, Exerts Utmost Effort to Reconcile Soviet-Italian Relations, and Is Willing to See Romania Obtain Security Guarantees

Capital City of Switzerland: According to news from Berlin, Germany is simultaneously engaged in diplomatic activities on several fronts. Firstly, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's personal meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is bound to have an effect in the short term. Secondly, relations between Germany and the Vatican are expected to be clarified. Thirdly, relations between Germany and the United States may soon normalize. Fourthly, now that the Soviet Union and Finland have restored peace, this is a good opportunity for the Nordic countries to promote relations. Germany intends to seize this opportunity to continue its activities. According to reliable information, the country seems to have fully expressed its support for the proposal of a defense alliance treaty between the three Nordic countries. Fifthly, Germany wants to make every effort to stabilize the situation in Southeastern Europe. Therefore, it will probably actively promote the proposal for the Soviet Union and Romania to sign a non-aggression treaty from the sidelines. In view of the above five points, the activity of German diplomacy can be seen. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

Amsterdam: The German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Dr. Schulenburg, will return to Berlin in a few days. It is expected that after Schulenburg arrives in Berlin, Hitler's efforts to reconcile Stalin and Mussolini will be further intensified. Hitler wants to use the reconciliation of the Soviet Union and Italy as a way to advance the Nazi plan in Southeastern Europe. Neutral sources with access to information said that Hitler hopes that the Soviet Union will sign a mutual non-aggression treaty with Romania and Turkey in the short term. According to news from the Nazi Party, the Soviet-Romanian negotiations are progressing well, but the negotiations with Turkey are only in the preliminary stages. It is heard that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, while in Rome, told Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that both the Soviet Union and Germany are prepared to guarantee the integrity of Romania. However, the Italian Prime Minister demanded a more specific guarantee. The current Soviet-Romanian negotiations on a non-aggression treaty are probably the reply that Germany wants to give to Italy. From Hitler's point of view, a Soviet-Turkish non-aggression treaty is even more important because it can counter the Anglo-Franco-Turkish alliance. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

The Hague: According to news from Berlin, the Romanian Minister to the Soviet Union, Teano, is scheduled to visit Foreign People's Commissar Molotov this afternoon to study the possibility of establishing an agreement between the two countries. This will be the first time that the Soviet Union and Romania have made contact. This is because the German government urgently hopes that the Soviet Union and Romania can move closer to each other. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

Rome: According to news from here today, Germany recently offered Romania a guarantee that the Soviet Union or Hungary would not invade Romania's borders, in exchange for the following: (1) the restoration of Romania's 1.6 million-strong army; (2) King Carol of Romania must restore good relations with the pro-Nazi Iron Guard; (3) Romania's industry must increase production under the guidance of German experts; (4) half of Romania's barley and oil exports must be controlled by Germany. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)

The Swiss capital city's "Ticino State Post" recently carried a dispatch from a Rome-based reporter stating that rumors of an impending rapprochement between Italy and the Soviet Union have recently been denied by Italian political figures. The newspaper also said that Italy's relations with Turkey are quite friendly, and they share the common goal of preventing the intrusion of Soviet forces into the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean coast. Turkey's attitude towards the Soviet Union has not changed, on the contrary, its relations with Britain and France are extremely close. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that since Soviet-Finnish peace has been restored, the Scandinavian Peninsula is temporarily free from the danger of becoming a war zone. Therefore, general speculation is focused on the possibility of changes in the Near East. There are many rumors regarding Romania's position. German propagandists claim that they have achieved something in Romania. However, according to well-informed Romanian sources in London, the news that Soviet and Romanian officials are conducting negotiations has not been confirmed. The German radio broadcast, which claimed that the Soviet-Romanian negotiations would completely change the international situation before the end of this week, is not worthy of attention. The Romanian side in London does not expect any surprising developments and believes that all the claims made by Germany are intended for internal consumption. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

### The Soviet Union and Italy Begin Commercial Negotiations, Germany Strongly Supports Them in Order to Promote Political Understanding

London: Soviet sources here recently confirmed that the Soviet Union and Italy have already begun commercial negotiations. Germany deeply hopes that the Soviet Union and Italy can move closer to each other, first establish a commercial agreement, so as to promote political understanding, just as Germany and the Soviet Union did in August of last year. Therefore, it will certainly support the Soviet-Italian commercial negotiations from the sidelines. At present, the Soviet Union and Italy have one thing in common, that is, they both hope that the current European war will end early without a clear winner, so as to prevent the wishes of the Soviet Union and Italy from being hindered and unrealized by the victor. This point is also recognized by Italian figures. In short, British political figures are paying close attention to the general situation, especially to the Soviet Union's plan to conduct commercial negotiations with Romania. After the Finnish-Soviet peace, the Soviet Union can use the new situation to expand its influence into the Balkan Peninsula. For this reason, Romania will be subjected to joint pressure from Germany and the Soviet Union. However, it is not yet known whether Italy will participate. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

Berlin: German sources declared yesterday that Germany has rapidly consolidated its position in Eastern and Western Europe and indicated that Germany will take "surprising actions" against the Allied forces within ten days. Nazi sources further claimed that Germany is silent for now, but if it moves, it will definitely take action on the Western Front. Currently, it is focusing on Moscow, Rome, and the Romanian capital. However, officials in Berlin and Moscow have denied any formal guarantee to Romania. Authoritative sources said, "It is unreasonable to say that Germany favors the Danish-Norwegian alliance proposed by Finland." Some believe that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, since visiting Moscow last September, has discussed the complex issue of Balkan security and also told Prime Minister Mussolini during his recent trip to Rome that Germany and the Soviet Union both want peace and tranquility in Southeastern Europe. It is said that Prime Minister Mussolini does not easily trust the Soviet Union's goals in the Balkans. However, the German side believes that Mussolini has accepted Ribbentrop's guarantee in order to improve relations with Moscow and cites rumors of Soviet-Italian commercial talks and diplomatic rapprochement as evidence. In short, it is still questionable whether Ribbentrop has obtained Moscow's consent. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)

### Romanian Iron Guard Voluntarily Reverts to Allegiance, Vows Loyalty to the Country, External Aggression Promotes Unity

Rome: It was announced here last night that King Carol of Romania and the Iron Guard, Romania's fascist organization, have reached a reconciliation. The King has granted freedom to all who pledge to abide by the National Renaissance Front. It has been determined that the National Renaissance Front is the only political organization allowed in Romania. Yesterday, the leader of the Iron Guard declared on behalf of the Dateri Kogo that the group accepted the Roman King's conditions. Rumor has it that the terms laid out by the Iron Guard for joining the National Renaissance Front include the release of 800 Iron Guard members, who are currently being held in shelters. Some of those detained have since been released, and leaders currently residing in Germany have been allowed to return to the country. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

Romanian Capital: Eight hundred members of the Iron Guard who had been imprisoned for months were released today. It is said that this was the result of Iron Guard members writing to the Romanian King to express their loyalty and not due to pressure from Germany. However, Professor Inisgu, the leader of the Iron Guard, passed away today due to heart disease. This point is a significant blow to the Iron Guard. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)

### German Economic Delegation to Visit Romanian Capital, Led by Schacht

Capital City of Switzerland: It has been learned that a German economic delegation, led by Dr. Schacht, the former president of the German Central Bank, and Clodius, the director of the Commercial Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is scheduled to go to the Romanian capital in the short term. However, Walda, an economic expert who previously participated in the German-Romanian economic talks, will not accompany them. The main task of the delegation is to redefine the exchange rate between the Mark and the Romanian Leu and to find ways to increase the amount of oil, soybeans, wool, and hides that Germany purchases from Romania, and Germany will provide agricultural technicians and various agricultural tools and seeds to develop Romania's agriculture. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

### Laval to Visit Rome to Adjust Franco-Italian Relations

Geneva: It was learned from reliable sources that former French Prime Minister Laval criticized the government in the Senate yesterday in a speech on Franco-Italian relations, accusing it of failing to fully consider Italy's position and failing to meet Italy's demands, making it adopt a more friendly attitude towards Britain and France. Regarding this matter, it was learned from well-informed sources that Laval may travel to Rome again on a "private trip" in the near future to investigate the content of Italy's demands today. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)

### Welles Revisits Rome to Meet with Italian King to Discuss Peace, and to Meet with Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister

Rome: After US Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here last night, he met with the Italian King today, leaving after a quarter of an hour. Later, he held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano for an hour. According to an official statement, the meeting lasted a long time and was very harmonious. German Ambassador McGansen was also present, but it was soon learned that McGansen's visit to the Italian Foreign Ministry had nothing to do with this matter. Welles will meet with the Pope on Sunday. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

London: Welles sent a telegram to Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax today, thanking them for their hospitality in London and asking the Foreign Secretary to convey his regards to the King and Queen of England. The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have replied, expressing their satisfaction and inspiration for Welles's decision to visit England and the opportunity to meet with each other. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

Rome: After US Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here last night, the European situation seems to have entered another stage. There may be a possibility of peace between Germany and the Allied forces. Well-informed circles here recently said that Welles's meeting with the Italian King at 9:00 this morning, which was not originally on Welles's schedule, was not without reason. Some believe that the content of Welles's talks with the Italian King was about a peace plan, which is said to have been proposed to the Pope by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at the Vatican this week. Welles may meet with the Pope on Sunday and visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano at 10:00 this morning. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will speak with Welles at 5:00 this afternoon, at which time Mussolini will claim that the prolongation of the European war will be enough to promote a large Eastern European group, including the Soviet Union, Germany, the Balkans, and the seaboard countries of Poland. Italy will also join. According to reports from the Vatican, under German pressure, the Soviet Union has made a guarantee to Romania that the issue of Bessarabia will be shelved during the European war. (United Press dispatch on the 16th)

Rome: The visit of US Undersecretary of State Welles again has recently been commented on by political figures here, saying that the events that have occurred in Europe in recent days, especially the signing of the peace treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland, have created a new situation. Whether Welles's mission will be successful depends on the outcome of his talks with Foreign Minister Ciano, Prime Minister Mussolini, and the Pope. In short, Welles has a thorough understanding of the attitudes of the belligerent countries on the issue of peace and war, and he can judge the value of any peace initiative in the future. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

### French Senate Trusts the Government, Calls for Cabinet Reshuffle

Paris: The Senate held secret meetings twice yesterday and today, and discussed in detail general issues of combat and the policies pursued by France on the issue of Finland. Former Foreign Minister Peng Gu, former Prime Minister Laval, and many other important senators successively raised inquiries, which were answered one by one by Prime Minister Daladier. The Senate finally unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the government, the content of which roughly stated that we are deeply impressed by the heroic resistance of the Finnish people, and the future of the country is very bright. It also stated that the Senate trusts that the French government will be able to make efforts to engage in war and achieve complete victory, so that all nations can restore freedom. Many members of the House of Representatives recently believed that the government should take advantage of the Senate's unanimous support to decide to reshuffle the cabinet and add two departments for information and propaganda. Although opinions on the cabinet reshuffle are quite divided among political figures, it is unanimously believed that the current policy will not change under any circumstances. In other words, France is determined to fight to the end until the final victory. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

Paris: The Paris edition of the New York Tribune recently stated that French political figures believe that Prime Minister Daladier will reshuffle the cabinet in the short term and form a wartime cabinet conference composed of important members to make various decisions quickly. In addition, Prime Minister Daladier is too burdened with his responsibilities as Minister of Defense and Foreign Affairs. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

Paris: Whether the Soviet-Finnish peace has any repercussions on the position of the French government is still a matter of concern in political circles. Some parties demanded that Britain and France should explore concrete policies for war, and to strike quickly as required, and advocated the establishment of a five or six-person war cabinet, in the spirit of the former Clemenceau to carry out the war, and to reduce Daladier's burden of serving as Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Army Minister. Right-wing politicians and newspapers still demanded the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union is Germany's ally. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

### British Colonial Secretary Visits Paris

Paris: British Colonial Secretary MacDonald arrived here today and will discuss economic and colonial issues with French Colonial Minister Mandel in the next few days. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

### Franco Plans to Form Anti-Soviet Group, Proposes to Italian Premier

London - According to authoritative sources here, Spanish dictator General Franco is suggesting to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that they organize a European anti-Communist bloc, with the aim of resisting Soviet encroachment in Europe. The proposal includes a provision for the use of force when necessary and encompasses a plan to enlist moral support from Latin American countries for anti-Communist efforts. Franco's special envoy is exerting considerable diplomatic pressure in Rome to establish the anti-Communist bloc. However, the Italian Prime Minister's decision remains unknown. Italy has made it clear that it will resist any Soviet invasion of the Balkan countries with force. Franco's plan reportedly aims to form a strong Italian-Spanish-British-French bloc to counter the Soviet Union. It is also said that Spanish official and public opinion has become extremely anti-German due to the German-Soviet pact, and the German secret police's confirmed atrocities against Polish Catholic priests have especially aroused public sentiment throughout Spain. Therefore, according to neutral diplomatic circles, Hitler's pact with the Soviet Union not only damaged the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis but also lost a potentially powerful ally, as he had attempted to have Spain attack the rear of France. Furthermore, according to diplomatic circles in Latin American countries stationed in London, in recent weeks, high-ranking Spanish civil and military officials have virtually severed relations with the German ambassador to Spain.

### Finnish Parliament Approves Peace Treaty with the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Explains Reasons for Choosing Peace Over War, Will Devote Efforts to Reconstruction with Sword in One Hand and Plow in the Other

Helsinki - The Finnish Parliament last night approved the peace treaty with the Soviet Union by a vote of 145 to 3, ceding one-tenth of its land to the Soviet Union and formally ending the Soviet-Finnish war. More than fifty members of parliament were absent or abstained from voting last night. The parliament convened secretly "somewhere in Finland." It is reported that Prime Minister Ryti, surrounded by the cabinet, strongly defended the peace treaty. According to well-informed sources, the treaty's passage was slightly opposed. (United Press, 16th)

Helsinki - The Finnish Parliament, after debating for two and a half hours last night, approved the peace treaty with the Soviet Union by a vote of 143 to 3. The Foreign Affairs Committee stated that under the current circumstances, it considered it necessary to advocate for accepting the treaty. Prime Minister Ryti stated that Finland and the entire Western civilization are still in great danger. No one can say what will happen tomorrow. We believe that choosing peace over war is the best option at present. We did not request Allied troops because this move would involve Finland in a major war, and the war zone would shift from the Western Front to the Scandinavian Peninsula. Furthermore, Sweden and Norway refused transit, making the arrival of reinforcements uncertain, and the Anglo-French willingness to send troops was too late. We must now work quickly on reconstruction, healing wounds, and maintaining our spiritual and material civilization, as well as the development of our society based on justice, with a sword in one hand and a plow in the other. Finnish President Kallio delivered a brief speech, recounting the past events leading to the war, requesting Parliament to approve the treaty, and stating that the Finnish government had repeatedly expressed its desire to restore peace since the beginning of the war. (Reuters, 16th)

### Soviet Troops Enter Viipuri, a Ghost Town, Residents of Finnish Conceded Areas Relocate Westward, Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young

Helsinki - As Soviet troops entered the devastated city of Viipuri last night, 400,000 Finns began their large-scale migration. Those abandoning their homes accounted for one-sixth of the entire Finnish population. Young women carrying infants, village women carrying furniture, traveled by truck or sleigh, along with a continuous stream of streetcars, trucks, and bicycles, all crowded on the road, heading west. Residents were not forced to leave, but only about one percent volunteered to remain in the ceded areas. The government mobilized all vehicles to assist in the relocation, requisitioning all vehicles within fifteen miles of the new border to transport departing people. All cars and railways in the country were mobilized. After the Soviet troops entered Viipuri, they found only a ghost town. For three days, residents had been continuously moving goods and equipment out of the city. Even large stores were empty. In the area west of Lake Ladoga, no less than 50,000 heads of cattle, sheep, pigs, and birds are being transported. Residents of the Hanko Peninsula are now leaving en masse. Freight cars loaded with goods stretched for miles, heading inland to various locations. The relocation is quite orderly. People from the same village gather together, walking in groups. Finnish soldiers are extremely exhausted, many unable to travel the five miles a day as stipulated in the peace treaty. An officer saw that hundreds of Finnish soldiers resting on the road had all frozen to death. (Reuters, 16th)

Stockholm - Since Finland appealed for assistance in transporting residents evacuating from ceded areas, thousands of Swedish cars, buses, and trucks have headed north to provide aid. At the same time, Sweden has begun to improve its domestic defenses. (Reuters, 16th)

Helsinki - The land ceded by Finland due to the Soviet-Finnish treaty has not yet been determined. The Karelian Isthmus ceded approximately 6,250,000 acres, with a population of approximately 410,000 to 440,000, including 84,000 in the cities of Viipuri, Käkisalmi, and Sortavala. Finland also lost the Hanko Peninsula, areas along the Arctic Ocean, and areas in the east. However, most of the residents of the ceded areas will relocate within the new borders, and the total Finnish population will not decrease significantly. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)

Helsinki - The first batch of Finnish regular troops withdrew from the Karelian front to this area yesterday. According to Finnish military sources, the Finnish troops on the northern front will withdraw on April 10, the last day stipulated, due to traffic congestion and transportation difficulties in that area. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)

### Finnish Army Will Not Demobilize for the Time Being

Stockholm - Finland has no intention of immediately demobilizing its army. Conscripted 18-year-olds are still reporting for duty, apparently planning to begin building new defense lines immediately after the troop withdrawal stipulated in the treaty is completed. (Reuters, 16th)

### War Costs Amount to 4.5 Billion

Helsinki - According to Finnish government estimates, the Soviet-Finnish war lasted three and a half months, and Finland consumed approximately 4,500,000,000 Finnish marks, including mobilization costs and the costs of keeping the troops prepared before the outbreak of the war. However, the losses from air raids are not included. It is generally believed that Finland's reconstruction will require many years of effort, and with the loss of vast territories, national income has decreased, making construction funding difficult. The Finnish government is seeking foreign loans. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)

### Defense Alliance Among Finland, Sweden, and Norway is Being Actively Planned, Unifying Artillery Calibers

Stockholm - According to news from here today, a defense alliance among Sweden, Norway, and Finland is still being actively planned. It is also reported that Sweden, Norway, and Finland are planning to unify the calibers of artillery in the three countries, so that the military equipment of the three countries can be mutually compatible in the event of an emergency, thereby enhancing their defense capabilities. It is reported that Norway and Sweden have decided to expand their military preparations. (United Press, 16th)

Berlin - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declared to foreign visitors that Germany's attitude toward Sweden and Norway has not changed after the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. Germany has maintained strict neutrality regarding the Soviet-Finnish war, just like Sweden and Norway, and opposes any chaotic state in any part of Europe. Therefore, Germany is deeply satisfied after the restoration of normal relations in Northern Europe and will continue to maintain relations with Northern Europe in accordance with its economic interests. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)

### Italian Corporate Council Passes Air Force Budget, Secretary of Aviation Says Air Force is the Decisive Factor in Future Wars

Rome - Italian Undersecretary of Aviation and Air Force Chief of Staff General Pricolo announced the plan to expand the air force to the Fascist Corporate Council yesterday. The Council immediately unanimously passed the Aviation Ministry's provisional budget for 1940, totaling 3,261,000,000 lire. Eighteen years ago, the Italian Air Force's budget was only 122,000,000 lire. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was also present when the budget was passed. General Pricolo reported on the development of the Italian Air Force, stating that the massive Italian Air Force is on standby, ready to fight and demonstrate its efficiency. We should remember that Italy's position is most vulnerable to air attacks, and we must strive for the improvement of the Air Force. The Air Force should adopt various technological inventions and build expensive aircraft, but an effective Air Force is absolutely necessary. Without an Air Force, there can be no victory, and the results of the Air Force depend on the combat aircraft being able to build the greatest combat achievements. Air Force operations must maintain contact with the army and navy, and its organization should not remain fixed but should be adapted to the needs of the time. In the current European war, the army has made no progress, naval battles are limited to attacks on merchant ships, and the Air Force also only has guerrilla warfare. There have been no large-scale air raids on military targets or cities. However, when the real war begins, the Air Force will undoubtedly occupy a decisive position. The German Air Force's attack on the Polish army and air force during the Polish war, which caused Poland to lose its will to fight, was the decisive factor in Poland's rapid collapse. Recently, the German Air Force has bombed many British merchant ships in the North Sea, with minimal losses to the Air Force. And the activities of naval fleets can only be restricted by the Air Force. The Mediterranean is Italy's lifeline, and the Italian Air Force will be able to actively attack the navy. The equipment of the Italian Air Force is neat, and the morale of the pilots is extremely high. When the Air Force is needed, it will not disappoint the people. Italy does not worry about the lack of pilots and aircraft, and the Italian Air Force's burning, resolute, and confident spirit is unprecedented. After General Pricolo finished his speech, the air force officers and soldiers in the audience cheered and paid tribute to Mussolini. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)

### British and French Forces in the Far East Intensify Cooperation

Amsterdam - According to a report in the "Times" from Singapore, the troops of the Allied Far Eastern colonies will intensify cooperation. A British officer will go to Hanoi in a short period of time to maintain contact with the Vietnamese French forces. The Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese French forces will also send an officer to Singapore to maintain contact with the British headquarters. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)

### British and French Military Preparations in the Near East

Istanbul - According to news received here from Ankara, Turkey, French Air Defense Commander-in-Chief General Moron will visit Turkey within days, with the aim of helping Turkey establish air defense fortifications. The British and French Air Force Commanders in the Near East recently held a meeting here, and now France has sent the Air Defense Commander-in-Chief to visit, which shows that Britain and France are still actively making various arrangements for the Near East.

### Saito's Expulsion Causes Significant Domestic Repercussions, Japanese Army Holds Meeting to Devise So-Called Ways to Harmonize Military and Civilians

Tokyo - Although Saito, who criticized the Konoe Declaration, has been expelled, this matter has not ended. The next act may have a greater impact on domestic politics than the Saito expulsion storm. When the cabinet and the military decided to punish Saito, they completely disregarded the right to freedom of speech in parliament granted by the constitution. Some members of the House of Representatives strongly opposed it, because before the House of Representatives obtained a two-thirds majority to pass Saito's expulsion, the political parties had already shown internal divisions and dissent. It seems that the general public approves of Saito's request for the government to thoroughly explain its China policy, so Saito's punishment not only greatly damages the credibility of political parties but will also cause repercussions in the future. The army now intends to take action on this, to inform the people of the true purpose of the "holy war" and promote harmony between the army and the people. Therefore, it has convened a meeting of garrison commanders from all over Japan in Tokyo. The Inspector General of Military Affairs detailed the points where Saito's remarks conflicted with the purpose of the "holy war" against China. Then, the commanders reported on the impact of Saito's remarks in the local areas. Finally, they discussed specific ways to enhance military-civilian harmony. It was ultimately decided that the military authorities should explain to local administrative officials and schools the unchangeable policy of the army and elaborate on the basic principles of the "holy war" against China. At the same time, the 국민신문 (Kokumin Shinbun) reported that some cabinet members seemed to support Saito's remarks. It is rumored that Koyamaya Kazuo, a Diet official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Oyama Kunitaro, a councilor of the Ministry of the Navy, have adopted an inappropriate attitude towards the explanation of the war policy. If this is the case, a situation of dispute may arise. (Reuters, 16th)

### Indian National Congress Holds Annual Meeting, Gandhi Publishes an Article, Struggle is Not Anti-British

Madras - The Indian National Congress is scheduled to hold its annual meeting in Ramgarh today. Former Chairman Acharya wrote a letter to the Congress, stating that the British did not come here as conquerors, but at the invitation of the people, and with the continued assistance of the people. We should remember the siege of Arcot, where Indians sacrificed their blood to help the British. The right of empire does not exist. The British side has recently shown an increasing willingness to treat India as part of the British Commonwealth of Nations based on equal treatment. If India completely breaks away from Britain, the result will be a lose-lose situation, which will be particularly unfavorable to India. (Reuters, 15th)

Bombay - In response to a reporter's inquiry about his belief in the sincerity of the Viceroy, Gandhi specially published an article in his mouthpiece "Harijan" today, saying that as far as he is concerned, he hopes to have several more meetings with the Viceroy. India's struggle is not anti-British. Its goal is to oppose exploitation and foreign rule, but not to oppose foreigners. Gandhi mentioned the possible invasion from the north. The elected male and female members of parliament, who have this kind of panic, will not petition the British to withdraw their troops, which is tantamount to signing their own death warrant. As for the issue of India's status, it is not the Congress Party but himself who has changed his mind. A more mature reflection has made him realize that the status of a dominion is not suitable for India. Gandhi did not say that Britain must recognize India's right to self-determination, and what it decides may even be a dominion, or slightly less than independence, or disguised independence, or complete independence, and could not predict. (Reuters, 16th)

### Death of German Steel Tycoon Völler, Chairman Chiang Sent Condolences

Chongqing - Berlin dispatches, German steel magnate Hua Fuller passed away in Germany on January 22 of this year. Hua started a small-scale steel business with his own funds in Germany in 1904, at the age of only 23. Before the European War from 1914 to 1918, he had great development in domestic and foreign markets. After 1918, he established several export branches in European countries and overseas. Hua was the first to conduct large-scale business with China and the Soviet Union, and Hua Fuller's production capacity also became increasingly stable. Hua was a co-founder of the United Steel Works, but later left the relationship and operated independently. Its business scope includes general steel business, iron ore mining, steel and metal industries, and its broader scope includes the production of tinplate steel and machinery industries, and is popular all over the world. The German government considered Hua Fuller to have made remarkable achievements in industrial management, and until recently, he was still employed as a special member of the National Defense Economy. After Hua's death, many important government officials and military leaders went to participate in the memorial service, which shows the importance of Hua's position during his lifetime, and the condolence messages from Chairman Chiang and ministers of various ministries are especially noted by all sectors here.

### British and Italian Trade Negotiations to Reopen, British Experts to Go to Rome to Study Coal and Other Issues

London - It is learned that British and Italian trade negotiations have not yet been formally reopened. The British government intends to send an expert to Rome on the 17th of this month to study the issue of debt repayment and coal. At present, informal talks are underway between the two sides in London, and an understanding is expected. (Havas, 15th)

London - The "Daily Telegraph" recently reported that, according to reliable sources, the British and Italian countries will soon reopen trade negotiations in order to sign a trade agreement and restore trade between the two countries to the amount in 1928, that is, 38,000,000 pounds per year. It is reported that Italy will sell heavy industrial manufactured goods to the United Kingdom in exchange for certain raw materials. As for the coal issue, Italy needs to purchase 12 million tons from foreign countries every year and cannot completely import it from Germany by rail. Therefore, it has ordered 5.5 million tons from the United Kingdom. This is considered by the United Kingdom to be able to double. In short, if the United Kingdom can know for sure that various Italian industries are not providing assistance to Germany, it is willing to continuously supply Italy with coal. (Havas, 15th)

(Haitong News Agency, 16th)

Washington - The Pan-American Economic Committee recently announced that the United States, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico have all agreed to sign a convention to establish the Pan-American Bank (capital of US$100 million) to lend funds to Latin American countries for purchasing goods from the United States. Honduras and Venezuela have expressed opposition to this, while Cuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, and El Salvador are still considering it and will submit their replies before April 1.

### Japan and Argentina Promote Trade, Exchange Goods in Large Quantities

Washington - The US Department of State announced yesterday that the Japanese ambassador to Argentina and the Argentine Foreign Minister recently exchanged documents on increasing Japanese-Argentine trade.

The purchase value of both parties is 40 million Japanese yen. (United Press, 16th)

Washington - Trade experts said today that the trade agreement established between Japan and Argentina is a psychological move by Japan, and its effect is intended to offset the blow of the abolition of the US-Japan trade agreement.

Paris – The Czech News Agency announced today that German authorities have recently been carrying out large-scale arrests of innocent people in the "Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia." Among those arrested are many Czech reserve officers, members of the Sokol sports association, and Catholics. In Moravia province alone, 25 priests have been arrested since last month. The German political police have recently been searching for secret wireless radio stations in various locations. As a result, residents who possess materials for manufacturing wireless transmitters or even those who own radio receivers are often arrested.

### British Consul in Tianjin Explains Butler's Remarks

Tianjin – The British Consul-General in Tianjin, White, issued a formal notice to the press today, stating that the telegrams regarding Butler's remarks in the House of Commons have caused misunderstandings in the city due to brevity. He can confirm that Butler's reference to negotiations meant negotiations regarding obstacles, difficulties, and restrictions encountered by British interests. As for the rumor that Japanese troops are collecting a fixed amount of tax from all Chinese entering the British Concession, he personally believes this rumor is entirely unfounded and that there is no evidence of Japanese officers extorting or accepting bribes. This matter was recently raised in the House of Commons by British Conservative MP Hanner, who asked Foreign Secretary Butler if he was aware that Japanese officers were collecting a fixed tax from Chinese entering the British Concession in Tianjin. (Reuters, 16th)

### Zhu Jiahua Discusses the European War - No Disadvantage to China (Continued) - China's Diplomacy is Adept and Bears an Important Mission for World Peace

The transportation situation between the Soviet Union and Germany is also worthy of our attention. Maritime transport in the Baltic Sea is easily threatened by the British and French navies, and in winter it cannot be fully used due to ice. Sea routes on the Black Sea and the Danube River must pass through other countries, and it is difficult to guarantee that they will not be cut off. The most reliable and convenient route is the railway across Poland. However, here we must consider the Soviet Union's transportation efficiency. Although its railways have increased from 73,000 kilometers to 85,000 kilometers, and the number of vehicles has increased from 475,000 to 645,000, with a carrying capacity increasing from 8.7 million tons to 15.7 million tons, according to experts' estimates, the Soviet Union can at most spare only one-tenth of its transportation capacity for exports to Germany. Assuming each wagon is used once a month, the transportation capacity freed up is still not enough to carry the iron sand normally needed by Germany.

With the above reasons, tangible or intangible, limiting economic exchanges between Germany and the Soviet Union, even if the two countries cooperate more closely, it will be truly difficult for the Soviet Union to support Germany's war effort single-handedly with economic aid.

### Fifth Discourse on "Tit for Tat"

Hitler is very clear that he knows Germany's economic weakness is the biggest weakness in war. Therefore, he adopted a "tit for tat" strategy to determine his war strategy. He knows that the materials needed by Britain during wartime are overseas (such as 47 percent of Britain's food imports, which must come from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other places). Since the British and French navies have tightly blockaded Germany, Germany has also used its submarines and magnetic mines to implement a counter-blockade against Britain. In order to achieve thorough results, it has also adopted a strategy of maritime guerrilla warfare, and even pocket battleships have been released to operate everywhere. According to statistics from the past four months, British ships have already lost more than one million tons. This number is certainly large enough, but the United Kingdom has a total of 21 million tons of commercial ships and is constantly manufacturing and replenishing them. It is impossible for Germany to defeat Britain's maritime power by relying on maritime guerrilla warfare. We know that in land warfare, if guerrillas do not cooperate with the regular army, there is no way to determine the outcome of the war. The same is true in naval warfare. The same is true for air warfare. If the air force does not cooperate with the army or navy, then even the air force that Hitler's Göring is most proud of will find it difficult to operate independently or decide the war. Moreover, in terms of the training and replenishment of air force personnel, Germany is also inferior to Britain and France. General statistics say that a healthy nation can only select one air force talent out of every thousand people. Assuming that each aircraft requires four people, then in the current European powers, no country can cultivate more than 20,000 aircraft, because aircraft can only be manufactured competitively, while the number of pilots and combat personnel is ultimately limited. Britain and France, including their colonies, have a total population of 625.3 million, which is at least more convenient for replenishing air force personnel than Germany. Therefore, the current German air force has a slight advantage compared to the air forces of Britain and France, but in the near future, Britain and France, relying on manpower, material resources, and financial resources to expand their air forces, will have a tendency to surpass Germany. At that time, Germany, considering the difficulty of replenishing personnel, may not be able to send its air force to the airspace of Britain and France to gamble everything. As for Germany's industrial areas, 60 percent are only 150 miles from the front line, making them vulnerable to attacks by enemy air forces, while Britain's industrial areas are more than 300 miles from the front line, which is much safer.

Maritime guerrilla warfare is certainly a good strategy, and the air force's maximum attack can also have a huge effect, but the major battle or decisive battle can only rely on land warfare. So far, both belligerent countries have tried their best to avoid direct contact, concentrating all their efforts on a war of attrition, seeking to exhaust the enemy's combat power to a considerable extent before seeking to determine the outcome. So when will the European war begin? That is, when will the belligerent countries begin to attack the Maginot Line or the Siegfried Line?

Although it is not entirely impossible to break through these two lines of defense, the sacrifices will be unimaginable. This is also the reason why both belligerent countries are unwilling to try easily. The lessons learned from the last war are that trench warfare is the most boring. If the trench warfare happens this time, it will take ten or a hundred times more time and effort than before, and the prolongation of the war is an expected event. The longer the war drags on, the more disadvantageous it will be for Germany.

Recently, there have been various rumors in military affairs. It is said that Germany will attack by way of the Netherlands and Belgium, or that it will try to drag Italy into the water in order to have a major battle in the Po Valley. Whether it is credible is a matter of doubt. Let us assume one thing. It is not achievable in the short term. On the German side, because it is subject to various objective conditions, it is beneficial to end the war as soon as possible, and therefore the demand for a main battle is more urgent than that of Britain and France. It is gradually adopting a destructive attrition strategy, which is slightly different from the strategy of Britain and France. Our country should not ignore it. (To be continued)

### Rice Shortage in Suzhou - Supply Does Not Meet Demand During the Transition Period

Suzhou Correspondence - Rice in the four rural areas of Suzhou City is currently in a transition period. Even if there is some storage, farmers must use it for self-sufficiency. In addition, the Japanese are widely collecting grain and sending it out of the country, so there is an extreme shortage of grain. The city once allocated 10,000 yuan from accumulated grain funds in the name of charity, intending to purchase and store grain from grain merchants. However, local farmers are having difficulty purchasing grain due to the difficulty of husking rice and selling it. Moreover, their stocks are insufficient and it is difficult to supply. Even purchasing from Wuxi is difficult because of the lack of indica rice and the difficulty of transporting it out without special permission, resulting in a situation where it is difficult to buy grain even with money.

### Status of Christian Schools in North China - Schools Not Interfered With by Any External Forces

(Beiping Correspondence) Christian schools in North China, "in the Beiping area," Yenching University still maintains its independent and detached position, with 970 students, and is extremely developed. Middle schools such as Chongde and Luzhi were closed due to the anti-British movement. Sanji Elementary and Middle School was also closed and reorganized. Caizheng Commercial College, established by the YMCA, maintains its original level and no longer recruits new students. Other middle schools continue to operate as usual. Elementary schools, except for Shude and Mingxian, which were temporarily closed due to the anti-British movement, continue to operate as usual. The number of students in each school has increased to the point where there is no room to accommodate them. In terms of economy, they have all recovered to the situation before the incident. Currently, due to high prices and increased living standards, teachers and staff are finding it difficult to make ends meet, but Yenching has implemented a 40% subsidy to maintain the livelihood of its employees. "Schools in the Tianjin area" moved to the Chinese Concession for classes due to the flood, and then returned to their original location in mid-October. Most of the students have returned to school, except for a few who have transferred. "Various places in Jidong," such as Changli, Australia, Tangshan (Fengao Middle School, established by the British Methodist Church, is still operating with 700 students), and Zunhua have seen a sharp increase in the number of students, and are maintaining their normal operations. "Shanxi schools," except for a few that have moved, have mostly changed the form of the school and opened bible schools. "Southern Hebei" and "Northern Shandong" to "Jinan" and its "western schools" are still open, but mostly offer Scripture courses and are no longer called formal schools. "Qilu University" has a specialized course in Jinan, with a fairly practical curriculum. In Pingjin and other places, church schools have not been forced to participate in any parades or celebrations, but Xinmin Youth Corps, junior high school boys and girls, must take an oath to join. The first article of the oath is "Respect God and Buddha and do our best for the country." In church schools, it is requested to change it to "Do our best for the freedom of religion and for the country." There are no changes in the curriculum, and textbooks for primary and secondary schools, except for universities, are all local textbooks, reducing the number of English hours, but keeping the original hours for middle schools as it is not necessary to learn, and it has not been interfered with. Elementary schools add two hours of Japanese, but local Chinese can be hired as teachers. In short, each school can study quietly, without any external interference.

### Finnish Government States - Unable to Prepare for World Games

(Helsinki, 15th, Haitong News Agency) After Finland and the Soviet Union concluded a peace treaty, the World Games Committee expressed its hope that this summer's World Games could still be held in Helsinki. However, today a spokesman for the Finnish government said that the energy of the people of the whole country must be concentrated on reconstruction work. Considering the time and money involved, Finland cannot undertake the preparation of the World Games.

(Helsinki, 15th, Havas) The 1940 Olympic Games, which had been decided to be held in the Finnish capital after Japan abandoned it, were virtually shelved due to the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet War. It is now learned that a decision on this matter can be obtained within a few months. According to senior officials of the organizing committee, the preparations are largely in place. Unless there are special circumstances, it should not be interrupted.

### Public Works Bureau Tax Increase: Repercussions Ensue; Hotel License Fees Triple; Taxpayers Express Dissatisfaction with White Russian Unit

Since the Public Works Bureau announced its intention to balance its budget and increase taxes, citizens have been apprehensive and uneasy. The Shanghai Hotel Association has sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession and Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese Director of the Public Works Bureau, seeking justice and assistance, as the Bureau has increased business license fees for the hotel industry by more than one and a half times. Excerpts from the original letter are as follows:

### Alarming Tax Rate Increase
To Whom It May Concern: According to reports from various members of our Association, they have recently received notifications from the Public Works Bureau stating that, effective April 1st of this year, all business license fees will be increased according to the original amount, with increases ranging from 150% to 200%. Our members are facing such a substantial tax increase that they not only cannot afford it but also risk being forced to close down. Therefore, we are compelled to request your Association's swift assistance to maintain our businesses. During the five or six years from the January 28th Incident to the August 13th Incident, our industry suffered a sharp decline, with few customers, and many businesses faced the threat of closure. Many shut down and changed ownership. Although there has been a turnaround in the past year or two, we are still struggling to recover from past losses. Moreover, due to the rampant inflation of prices recently, it is even more difficult to make a profit. We will not discuss the high prices of all supplies for now, but just take coal as an example. Each ton costs over 250 yuan. The amount of coal used by each hotel per day (taking a medium- to lower-class hotel with fifty rooms that does not use water heating during the off-season) is at least two baskets to half a ton (and one to two tons when using water heating). The daily room revenue may not even be enough to cover the cost of coal alone. Although our members have slightly increased prices, it is a drop in the bucket and does not make up for the losses. Furthermore, water, electricity, food, salaries, rent, and everything else have increased significantly. Under these circumstances, what profit can be made? It is reasonable for the Public Works Bureau to moderately increase taxes to balance its budget, but the increase in tax rates, from 150% to 200%, is unprecedented.

### Unstable Recovery, Unbearable Burden
As for whether the Public Works Bureau's expenditures are reasonable, we will leave that aside. Should the hotel industry bear the responsibility for balancing the budget? It is said that tax collectors must first cultivate tax sources. Our hotel industry is still in a period of unstable recovery and is in urgent need of nurturing. The sudden imposition of such an unaffordable tax rate is not only akin to extortion but is also intended to kill our industry. For the survival of all our members, our Association must cry out loudly and seek assistance from all just parties. We also request your Association to forward a letter to the Public Works Bureau, asking them to carefully consider, promptly revoke this order, and make appropriate reductions to maintain the livelihood of our members. We earnestly pray for this. This is addressed to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession. The letter addressed to Mr. Yu Qiaqing roughly states: We believe that you, sir, are a leader of the community, treating the people as if they were injured. For decades, you have been righteous and chivalrous, and you have long been respected by all citizens. Moreover, you have been elected as a Chinese Director for many terms, and your words carry great weight in the Public Works Bureau.

### What Kind of Work Does the White Russian Unit Do?
According to the North-China Daily News, taxpayers in this city are angered by the high cost of living in Shanghai and the impending increase in city taxes, which places a heavy burden on them. They intend to vent their anger on the White Russian unit of the foreign volunteer corps and ask what kind of work this unit does that makes it necessary to maintain. In fact, the work of the White Russian unit is very heavy. The following duties of the unit show a glimpse of this: The White Russian unit has a total of 13 officers and 311 soldiers of various ranks. At least 30 of them must be stationed at the headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps for a long time. 22 are drivers of transport vehicles, and 8 are messengers. The unit sends out 41 soldiers to guard the Bund floating dock, 28 to guard the Isolated Army camp on Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road, and 18 to guard the Public Works Bureau Building and the Bund Volunteer Corps barracks. In total, 87 people perform their duties every day. In addition, 30 people are on standby at the Volunteer Corps headquarters at any time, ready to respond to any emergency calls. Thus, a total of 117 people are on duty or on standby every day, accounting for more than one-third of the entire unit. Anyone who has served in the military for a long time knows that the work of a unit with one-third of its personnel on duty every day is extremely heavy.

After their shifts, the soldiers do not simply eat and do nothing as some people imagine. In addition to those who have just rested after a 24-hour shift, those who are not on duty must train for riot control and firearms practice for five or six hours a day. The White Russian unit provides a great deal of assistance to the police department. For example, guarding the Bund floating dock helps protect police officers but does not involve inspections. The White Russian unit constantly assists the police department in conducting searches, and they set up a cordon around the houses being searched. The White Russian unit was established in January 1927 with two companies, and then a third company was added in February 1932 to reach its current strength. It was originally the police department's reserve force, avoiding the need to mobilize the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to deal with minor emergencies.

### US Warship Movements

According to news from the US Navy, the US Yangtze River gunboat "Luzon" will set sail for Wuhu tomorrow morning (the 18th). Commander Glasford of the US Yangtze River Patrol Force was originally stationed on the "Luzon." Since the "Luzon" is about to leave Shanghai, he may remain in Shanghai and be stationed on the "Guam," which is about to arrive in Shanghai from Wuhu. However, there is no confirmed report on Glasford's whereabouts at this time. It is said that after the "Luzon" arrives in Wuhu, it will be stationed there for a month and then exchange positions with the "Guam." In addition, there has been no news as to whether the US cruisers Augusta and Marblehead will come to Shanghai after transferring to Qingdao and Yantai next month.

### Remote Prospects for Opening the Yangtze River; Japanese Side Uses Evasions
### Spokesman for Japanese Embassy Says Matter Still Requires Further Discussion

Regarding the issue of opening the Yangtze River, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said at a press conference, "After the establishment of the new Central Government," whether the issue of opening the Yangtze River falls within its legal jurisdiction to be resolved still needs to be discussed, or it may be decided by the newly established "government." However, the principle of the opening policy must be determined by the Japanese government in Tokyo. Whether it will be opened remains uncertain.

### Price Stabilization: Developments Expected;
### Several Systems to be Implemented Soon

The Shanghai Times reports that the Price Stabilization Subcommittee recently established by the French Concession Municipal Council and the Public Concession Public Works Bureau to investigate the abnormal living conditions and propose improvement measures is currently carrying out its work smoothly. Although no concrete steps may be taken until the current investigation work is completed, full cooperation between the Municipal Council and the Public Works Bureau has now been implemented, and several systems are expected to be developed soon. About ten days ago, the two subcommittees held a preliminary meeting to formulate a plan for conducting the investigation.

### Public Works Bureau American Director Candidate:
### Mr. Allman's Remarks: He Values Good Governance and Economy Above All Else

In this year's election for directors of the Public Works Bureau, the American community is enthusiastically supporting American lawyer Mr. Allman as a candidate. The American Association will begin preliminary elections to select two official candidates from among the three candidates, Mr. Allman, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. McDonald. It is said that Mr. Allman is likely to be selected. According to Mr. Allman's statement on the election, "Many friends have recently urged me to run as a candidate for director of the Public Works Bureau. I have reluctantly complied with the wishes of my friends and am willing to be one of the candidates. I have been in China since 1916 and served in the American diplomatic and consular services for seven years. After resigning in 1923, I have been practicing law in Shanghai, with an office in the Public Concession. Since 1932, I have resided in the area beyond the concession boundaries, Anhe Temple Road, and paid city taxes to the Public Works Bureau for my residence and office. When the American Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was established in 1923, I joined the unit. Having lived in Shanghai since 1921, I now hope to spend the rest of my life here. What I care about is that the Public Works Bureau should levy the lowest possible taxes commensurate with good governance and see the Public Works Bureau paying for current expenses and future obligations within the limits of its ability, based on a balanced budget. I cannot express my views on various municipal issues in this short letter. In fact, I have not yet considered many municipal issues in detail, so I cannot express intelligent opinions. But if I am nominated and elected, I will devote ample time to studying and understanding municipal issues one by one. In any case, I value good governance and economy above all else. I am not a candidate for any individual, company, or party. If nominated and elected, I will not be obligated to any private individual, but will regard myself as representing all the citizens of the Public Concession, regardless of whether they have the right to vote."

### Coal Briquette Sale Extension for Ten Days: Cooked Water Industry Decides to Request Direct Supply

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, at the request of the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, is seeking ways to help small coal briquette factories so that they can continue to ship goods and maintain operations. The Chamber held a joint meeting of various coal dust companies at its office on Hong Kong Road yesterday afternoon. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Xu Jilong, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Yan Esheng, and representatives from coal companies such as Yitaixing, Dalongxing, Tongcheng, and Yicheng attended. All resolutions will be announced after being revised. It is reported that the coal briquette sale will be extended for ten days until early April.

The Cooked Water Industry Claims: There are more than 600 tiger stoves (boiled water vendors) in the two concessions, and 550 of them are members of the Association. Each household uses about 5 to 7 tons of coal per month, and the entire cooked water industry in the city needs about 3,000 tons of coal per month. Before the war, the price of coal was only about ten yuan per ton. In the past two years, the price of coal has gradually increased, and recently it has broken the 200 yuan mark. Under these circumstances, the general cooked water industry is operating on a small scale. How can they maintain their business?

The Only Solution is to request direct supply from the Kailuan Coal Company. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will show sympathy and assistance. As for how to negotiate, it is not convenient to disclose at this time.

### Large Quantities of Rice and Wheat Arriving in Shanghai Again: Rice Prices Expected to Fall Sharply; Third Phase of Price Stabilization to Begin the Day After Tomorrow

The Public Works Bureau Police Department announced: The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has decided to resume price stabilization in the Public Concession and the French Concession starting on March 19th. Rice shops are entrusted to handle ticket sales and rice distribution from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day. Each ticket sells for 1 yuan in legal tender, and each yuan can buy 5.5 catties (market catties) of rice. The rice shops that issue tickets are listed on the ticket, and ticket holders can go directly to the respective rice shops to purchase. This kind of price stabilization is purely a charitable act intended to benefit people's livelihood. All rice buyers must be mindful of this purpose, strictly abide by order, and not cause trouble. Those who are unruly and cause trouble at the rice shops will be immediately arrested and severely punished.

The third phase of price stabilization will begin on March 19th. Eighty rice shops entrusted by the Rice Shop Association will handle the distribution. There will be 24 price stabilization locations in the Public Concession and 16 in the French Concession. Each location will sell 50 bags of rice per day. The Public Works Bureau Police Department of the Public Concession and the French Concession Municipal Council Police Department will send police to maintain order. It is reported that the third phase of price stabilization is scheduled for 20 days, with a daily budget of 2,000 bags, totaling about 40,000 bags of rice. The price stabilization donation funds are still significantly insufficient, so efforts are being made to continue soliciting donations from various industries, and it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will actively donate.

Rice and Wheat Arriving in Droves: The Continental Daily News reports that yesterday (the 15th), according to sources in the Shanghai business community, ships arriving in Shanghai from grain-producing areas recently have been carrying large quantities of food, especially rice and wheat, so food prices are expected to "fall sharply" within days. In the past week, no less than 200,000 bags of rice and wheat have been shipped to Shanghai, and it is expected that even more rice and wheat will be shipped here in the next few days. The Norwegian ship "Angarnes," carrying 16,000 bags of rice, arrived from Saigon yesterday. The Norwegian ship "Fram," carrying 25,000 bags of rice, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Saigon on the 16th. The Danish ship "Nordvand," sailing from Australia, is carrying over 7,500 tons of wheat and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th. Although domestic rice shipped from the river is still scarce, it is reported that domestic rice "smuggled" by trucks from rice-producing areas to the two concessions reaches more than 20 vehicles per day and is increasing.

Rice Subsidy Amount: The Public Works Bureau has previously decided to issue rice subsidies to its Chinese employees with monthly salaries of 100 yuan or less to show its concern. It is now learned that the amount of this rice subsidy for March is 6 yuan and 7 jiao. The Shanghai Postal Administration's issue of increasing rice subsidies for employees, after being approved by the Kunming Postal Administration, has now established a rice price assessment committee, with Postmaster Zha Peilin as the chairman and the heads of various sections as members. Patrol officers are also assigned to investigate market rice prices at any time to balance the calculation. The subsidy method is based on a rice price of 30 yuan (per stone) as the standard. If this number is exceeded, the bureau will balance and provide rice subsidies. In addition to March, the bureau will also balance and investigate the rice prices at that time and provide subsidies for January and February. The above-mentioned subsidies have been issued in full by the bureau yesterday.

### British and French Ambassadors to China Reportedly Returning to Shanghai

According to well-informed sources, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and French Ambassador Cosme will jointly return to Shanghai from Chongqing soon. It is also learned that Sir Clark Kerr has completed his mission in Chongqing for two months of contact with diplomatic authorities, so he is scheduled to depart for Shanghai in the coming days.

### Civilian Women and Children's Hospital Fundraising: Target of 50,000 Yuan

The Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital is launching a fundraising campaign to raise operating expenses, with a target of 50,000 yuan. The hospital provides free childbirth services, benefiting the poor and needy. The following is a brief history of the hospital and the details of this fundraising campaign:

Brief History of the Hospital: In the autumn of 1937, Shanghai was affected by the war, and no fewer than 200,000 refugees from the suburbs sought refuge in the concessions, enduring much hardship. Pregnant women, in particular, could not be sent to the hospital on time, especially after curfew at night, which was even more dangerous. Various charitable organizations, such as the International Red Cross, the International Relief Committee, the Shanghai Women's Association, the Shanghai Youth Association, the Public Works Bureau Health Department, the Salvation Army, and the Chinese Child Welfare Association, discussed repeatedly and proposed setting up a maternity shelter near the hospital to provide pregnant women with adequate nutrition and avoid the danger of rushing around when labor began. Therefore, it was jointly decided to organize the hospital. The original site was at 110 Robison Road. Since its establishment, it has been unanimously supported by Chinese and foreign people, and refugee pregnant women have benefited greatly. The hospital's maternal mortality rate is only about 1%, which is better than any refugee hospital. Recently, the hospital moved to 737 Weihaiwei Road because the lease of the Robison Road building had expired.

Social Needs: Based on one and a half years of experience, the hospital knows that the poor in Shanghai urgently need the hospital. Among all the hospitals in Shanghai, there is no free childbirth service. The only one is Tongren Hospital, but the number of beds is limited, and those who arrive later often have no chance. Although the hospital currently has 50 beds, it is still not enough, so it is urgently necessary to expand. The current director of the hospital is Dr. Shen Jiying. Shen was a pediatrician at Peking Union Medical College and has served in the Peking Health Bureau and the Children's Welfare Committee. Dr. Shen, with his rich experience and enthusiasm for service, has formulated a service network in Shanghai to meet the needs of maternity services in Shanghai and strive for popularization. Two centers have been established: one is the industrial department of the YWCA, and the other is the refugee shelter on Dunxin Road. The hospital is also studying ways to provide services to pregnant women who cannot leave their homes to be hospitalized during childbirth.

Fundraising Campaign: To maintain the above-mentioned services and to find a suitable site for the hospital once and for all, a fundraising campaign is now being launched, with a target of 50,000 yuan. It is hoped that Chinese and foreign people will enthusiastically support it. A donation of 20 yuan in national currency can cover the cost of one childbirth. A donation of 500 yuan can maintain the annual cost of one maternity bed (available for free use by 25 pregnant women per year). All donations can be sent directly to Yu Zhongkui, Honorary Accountant, Room 512, 113 Jiujiang Road.

Sponsors: The sponsors and team leaders for this fundraising campaign are listed as follows: Chairman of the Management Committee Pan Zhiquan. Sponsors are Mrs. Fei Xiu, wife of the German Ambassador; Mrs. Yan Huiqing; Zhu Chuanquan; Feng Bingnan; Lin Kanghou; Xu Hanxiang; Madden; Yuan Ludeng; Bu Fangji; and Xue Erge. The team leaders are Xu Hanqing, Mrs. Yao Naibin, Hou Xiangfan, Ma Bole, Zhang Tuolian, Tang Jiyun, Wei Bogui, Tang Xinghai, Mrs. Rong Xianlin, Mrs. Rong Mingsan, and Mrs. Luo Xiangyi. The chairman of the propaganda committee is Mrs. Yu Yingjie, the chairman of the economic committee is Lu Meiseng, and the consulting physicians are Wang Yihui, Wang Shuzhen, Bu Huade, and Xu Shixun. The director is Shen Jiying, and the chief physician is Geng Huizhen.

### American Residents in Shanghai Investigate War Losses: Damage Claims Group Established Last Week

According to reports, American merchants and residents in the Shanghai concessions have suffered significant losses due to the Japanese military actions in China after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, a "War Damage Claims Group" has been established to investigate the extent of the damage. The "War Damage Claims Group" was established last week and now hopes that American residents will report information to the group's new office at 209-217 Fuzhou Road for collection to serve as a basis for future negotiations.

### Japanese Factory Strike:
According to the North-China Daily News, 280 workers at the Gongxing Iron Factory (transliteration), a Japanese-owned factory at 710 Taopeng Road, Yangshupu, went on strike yesterday (the 15th) because a worker was beaten by a Japanese supervisor. In recent months, there have been many labor disputes in foreign-owned factories in the eastern district, but a strike at a Japanese factory is rare.

### Scout Troop Commemorates Scout Production Day: Mourning the Death of Founder Baden-Powell, Condolences Sent to Family

The day before yesterday (the 15th) was the Chinese Scout Production Commemoration Day designated by the Ministry of Education and the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts. Scout troops in the city held commemorative ceremonies, vowing to uphold the spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and to intensify production and serve the society and the country. In addition, they unanimously expressed their condolences for the recent death of world scout founder Baden-Powell in London. The Shanghai Scout Troop No. 2068 held a production day commemoration meeting at its troop headquarters the night before last at 7:30 PM. More than 100 members attended. Troop leader Ding Chuanlong reported the significance of the commemoration. The entire group observed a moment of silence for scout founder Baden-Powell and resolved to jointly send condolences to the Baden-Powell family with other scout troops.

### Banking Industry Supports Ministry's Order: Willing to Lend Price Stabilization Funds; Assist in Cracking Down on Manipulation of Necessities; Various Industries Prepare to Establish Price-Controlled Purchase and Sales Outlets

In order to crack down on hoarding of daily necessities and implement price stabilization, Shanghai industry groups have decided to proceed in accordance with the Ministry of Economic Affairs' issued "Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Price-Controlled Purchase and Sales." Regarding the operating funds for the price-controlled purchase and sales outlets, in addition to the four banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture) agreeing to allocate funds in stages according to actual needs, commercial banks and money shops are willing to fully cooperate. However, their accounting will be directly audited and supervised by those responsible for the operating funds. If the profits from the purchase and sales outlets are insufficient to cover expenses and there are losses, the government may be requested to allocate funds to supplement them. After the implementation of the above measures, it will be possible to eliminate the evils of middlemen monopolizing exorbitant profits, and people's livelihood will be greatly benefited. Financial institutions themselves can also benefit from stability. The reasons for the recent surge in prices are generally no more than: (1) imbalance between supply and demand, (2) rampant speculation, and (3) hoarding by domestic merchants. It is reported that various industries are studying and proceeding with the issue of establishing price-controlled purchase and sales outlets.

### Shareholder Bonuses Not Subject to Income Tax

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from Huachang Match Splint Co., Ltd. inquiring whether the company, in 1939, should deduct income tax from the additional 1.2% shareholder bonus and employee bonuses issued in addition to the 8% dividend already issued in accordance with regulations. The Chamber of Commerce explained that: "We have taken note of your letter. Employee bonuses belong to the category of remuneration income under Article 1, Category 2 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and should be subject to income tax. However, shareholder bonuses are not within the scope of stock interest under Article 1, Category 3 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations. Moreover, Item 1 of the Collection Guidelines for Income Tax on Category 3 Securities and Deposits issued by the Ministry of Finance stipulates that stock interest is limited to dividends from limited companies and joint-stock limited companies. Therefore, shareholder bonuses are not required to be taxed by law."

### River Collision Tragedy Last Night: Japanese Merchant Ship Collides with False Police Ferry, Drowning Seven People Including Japanese Military Police

At 11:00 PM the night before last (the 15th), a tragic incident occurred in the outer reaches of Lujiazui, Pudong, in which a Japanese ship collided with a false "Water Patrol Team" ferry, drowning seven people including two Japanese military police, one false female police officer, and four members of the false ferry's crew (captain, engineer, and sailors). The false "Police Bureau Water Patrol Corps" ferry No. Hu 10 operates daily from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM between the Japanese Consulate Wharf in Hongkou and the Dongchang Road Wharf in Pudong, carrying "government officials" and Japanese officers and soldiers. It is commonly called the liaison boat. At 11:00 PM the night before last, the last boat departed from the Japanese Consulate Wharf to return to the Dongchang Road Wharf, carrying only seven people, including six Japanese military police and one "female police officer." The regular captain, Chen Jinlong, had already returned home and was not on board. The second captain, Zhuang Jinlong, was driving. When sailing to the outer reaches of Lujiazui, Pudong, it was struck by the Japanese merchant ship "Taigu Maru No. 18" of the Tianshengang Line, fully loaded with passengers and goods for export.

In the darkness, the two sides met and were unable to avoid each other. The bow of the "Water Patrol Team" ferry was hit and a hole was made. The ship shook, and the river water poured in at the point of impact. It sank to the bottom in a few minutes. Passengers and crew members fell into the water at the same time. Nearby small boats rescued some people, but only four Japanese military police were rescued. One Japanese military police officer, one false "female police officer," the ferry's second captain Zhuang Jinlong, engineer Zhang Afa, Zhuang Jinlong's younger brother (a sailor), and a cook, totaling seven men and women, all drowned.

The bodies were submerged and untraceable. After the tragedy occurred, the Japanese naval military police team stationed on the Beijing Road Bund waterfront hotel dispatched troops by motorboat to the outer reaches of the accident site. The captain of the Taigu Maru was detained. The Taigu Maru, because it was carrying passengers and cargo, was allowed to leave. The captain was taken to the naval military police team, reprimanded for causing the accident and not providing rescue, slapped dozens of times, and detained for further investigation. Yesterday, the false "Water Patrol Team" and the Japanese military police team dispatched small boats to salvage the bodies of the seven Chinese and Japanese men and women who were killed. As of last night, they had not been recovered.

### Arts and Disaster Relief Fair Opens Yesterday; Over 5,000 Visitors; Children's Health Competition Today

Yuan Luhou cut the ribbon. Yesterday's performances were extremely brilliant, and slogans were posted everywhere, such as "Tens of thousands of child refugees are starving to death," and "Watch a play and help with disaster relief – it's a win-win." The crowd that went to see the show yesterday reached more than 5,000 people. Today's program is even more exciting than yesterday, with Peking Opera from the Hua Lian Tong Le Hui, a spoken drama from the Universal Student Association, and a new Changzhou-Wuxi opera from the Changzhou-Wuxi Drama Art Improvement Association. There will also be a children's health competition at 2:00 PM, with generous prizes donated by various pharmacies, companies, and factories.

### Maid Accuses Employer of Rape and Abandonment

Huang Meixian, a Shaoxing woman residing at No. 29, North Lane, Cihou Lane, Hartung Road, is 21 years old this year. She has hired three lawyers, Yan Guchang, Jin Yu, and Zhu Dianqing, to represent her in a private prosecution at the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court against He Zhaoting (66 years old), a Ningbo native residing at No. 84, Pushi Road, accusing him of using his authority to coerce and rape her, thereby undermining public morals. According to her statement, the plaintiff was hired by the defendant as a maid when she was 15 years old. Last spring, the defendant's concubine fell ill, and the plaintiff served her medicine. On the second day of the fourth lunar month of the same year, the defendant forcibly raped her and promised to take the plaintiff as a concubine. Afterwards, she was raped again, which was discovered by his concubine, who planned to expel the plaintiff. When she questioned the defendant, he initially made empty promises, but then ignored her altogether. Having no choice, she moved out. Since then, the defendant has completely ignored her. The defendant has committed a crime under Article 221 of the Criminal Law, and she requests that the court investigate and prosecute him according to the law. According to the complaint, the court opened a hearing yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, presided over by Judge Miao Qingbang. The plaintiff and her three lawyers arrived in court, stating the circumstances of the rape and abandonment. The defendant also arrived in court with his defense lawyer, Wang Hengyi, absolutely denying that he had raped the plaintiff, claiming that it was a malicious accusation and requesting a thorough investigation. After reviewing the statements, the court decided that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing to the 26th.

### YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge Sues Tenants for Rent Arrears

### College Student Living with Girlfriend Arrested for Stealing Her Possessions; Stealing Lover's Belongings and Disappearing; Reported to Police; Arrested; Ordered to be Detained Pending Investigation and Interrogation

Zhu Danming, a local woman aged 19 (also known as Yan Danming because she later took the surname Yan), had studied at a certain prestigious girls' school in the city. Because her family was relatively well-off, Ms. Zhu also had some savings. About a year ago, Zhu met Li Youhuan, a Guangdong native aged 24 studying at the law school (resident of No. 657, Baker Road, son of Li Menghuan of Guangdong), and they fell in love.

Rented a house and lived together. The location of their cohabitation was No. 2, Sanyi Lane, Xinzha Road. After they started living together, the woman became pregnant and is now eight months pregnant. Recently, Li, perhaps because Ms. Zhu's money had run out, began to feel disgusted with her. Luo Yanong had previously borrowed 1,000 yuan from Ms. Zhu, and when he went to Sanyi Lane on the 9th of the month to return the 1,000 yuan to Ms. Zhu, both Zhu and Li were present. Zhu put the money into a chest. However, since that day, Li suddenly

Stopped coming altogether To Ms. Zhu's place. When Ms. Zhu opened the chest on the 14th to retrieve something, she discovered that the 1,000 yuan in legal tender returned by Luo, as well as a diamond ring worth 900 yuan and a gold ring, had disappeared. Since no one else had been to the house, it was obviously stolen by Li. Therefore, on the 15th, she reported it to the Xinzha police station. After the Chinese detective Xu Zhengting went to the law school to investigate, he found that Li had not attended school since the 9th. When he went to Li's father's place, he said that he never interfered with his son's affairs and actions. It was not until 8:30 PM the day before yesterday that he was

Li was arrested at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court No. 8 of the Special No. 1 Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin requested permission for temporary detention because the case still needed to be investigated in detail. Ms. Zhu also hired lawyer Zhang Fukang to come to court and brought a civil suit. When questioned, Li denied that he was present when Luo Yanong handed over the money and denied stealing the money and jewelry. After Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the statements, he ordered Li Youhuan to be detained and adjourned the hearing for further review.

### Local Briefs

There are about 200 workers in the gilding industry in this city, specializing in gilding grass-cloth hats and book trademarks. Their wages are meager. Due to the high cost of goods, they have demanded that management improve their treatment. Because this was not accepted by management, a work slowdown began on the 13th. After three days, it has not yet been resolved. Worker representatives Ni Shijiu and others went to Ningbo yesterday to petition the local association and the political department of the central police, requesting mediation to maintain the workers' livelihood. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, acknowledging receipt of the telegram regarding the prohibition of navigation at Haimen and stating that the request for Taiyuan Wood Company to hire a special ship to transport timber could not be approved. It was requested that this be relayed immediately.

The Shanghai Trucking Industry Association, after a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, decided that starting from the 15th of this month, truck transportation fees will be 6 yuan per hour in national currency, limited to the areas within the British and French concessions.

The local sauce and liquor industry once made significant progress in contributing additional donations, but it was later suspended for some reason. It is now heard that the industry, after being encouraged by the association, has scheduled a meeting at the Shipping Club at 2:00 PM on the 19th of this month to discuss ways to continue making donations.

The Zhou Bichu solo landscape oil painting exhibition being held in the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Great World Department Store is on its fourth day today (the 17th).

### Opportunity to Study National Affairs; Mr. Feng Shujin Generously Supports the Student Association

Last year, in my spare time, I joined the Silver Money Friendship Association's Silver Money Remedial Night School to study Chinese. Teacher Zhou Shaochun's patient and encouraging teaching made me feel like I was bathed in the warmth of spring. I felt that such a good teacher was rare. This spring, the association continued to run the night school, designating the Chinese language course as a specialized class, which began on March 15th at the Minsheng Middle School on Beijing Road. Teacher Zhou was again hired as the professor, and many people joined. Last year, the association limited the admission qualifications to people in the silver money industry. Now, in order to popularize part-time continuing education, outside men and women are also admitted with modified requirements. However, in this autumn of high prices and difficult living conditions, many workers in various industries, limited by their financial situation, are unable to study. Therefore, I especially wish to offer a modest subsidy for one semester's tuition (limited to ten people) to those who are ambitious to learn but lack the means to do so if they join the Chinese language class. Those interested please send a letter to Feng Jinshu at the Central Savings Association in this city to discuss the matter.

### Compulsory Execution Law (1) Implemented on January 19th of this Year

Compulsory execution is the final stage of judicial power and is extremely important. The civil procedure execution rules currently followed by various courts in our country were promulgated by the Beijing government's Ministry of Justice on August 3, 1920, and amended by the Beijing Ministry in January 23 and December 4, 1925. In accordance with the National Government's order of August 12, 1927, it was temporarily approved for reference. Later, on May 22, 1932, the Judicial Administration Department issued a circular ordering the implementation of supplementary civil execution measures. The Compulsory Execution Law, promulgated by the National Government on January 19 of this year, contains a total of 142 articles and is related to current court lawyers, litigants, and relevant third parties. It is specially excerpted on the left:

Chapter 1: General Provisions (Article 1) Civil compulsory execution matters shall be handled by a civil execution office established in the local court. (Article 2) The civil execution office shall have full-time judges and clerks to handle execution matters, but in courts with simpler matters, judges and clerks may handle them concurrently. (Article 3) Compulsory execution cases shall be handled by judges and clerks under the supervision of process servers. (Article 4) Compulsory execution shall be based on the following execution titles: 1. A final judgment that has been finalized; 2.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao, I respectfully write to you regarding a news item on page 10 of today's newspaper, which states "The Anderson Electric Bulb Factory Work Stoppage Resolved." I am extremely surprised. (1) Our factory has approximately 800 employees, not more than 1,500. (2) Our factory address is 140 Shengli Road, which is far from Jiaozhou Road. (3) The employees' request is for rice subsidies, not a wage increase. (4) This matter occurred at 4:00 PM on February 27th and was resolved satisfactorily at 10:00 PM that night. There was no work stoppage. The report is inaccurate. Therefore, I am writing to you to request that you correct the news item in tomorrow's newspaper. Respectfully, General Manager of Odd Anderson Electric Company, March 15th.

### Finance: Loans Due and Redemption Urged; Gold Prices Want to Rise but are Obstructed; Opening Price Again Surges Past 5,100 Yuan; US and British Exchange Rates Expected to Rise Again Today

Yesterday's spot gold secret market conditions opened strong, but the rise was fleeting and quickly declined. This was because the US exchange rate was initially tight and then hard, and speculative traders had loans due, and were forced to sell by HSBC to redeem them, causing most of the early gains to be lost. The opening rose because the US exchange rate was tight, coupled with Hong Kong trading, and retail investors also followed suit, so it jumped 97 yuan to a high of 5,130 yuan under competitive buying. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange stopped tightening due to Hong Kong electricity's efforts to sell pounds and buy dollars. Futures suddenly loosened across the board. There are reports today that the US and British exchange rates are expected to rise again. Securities traders took advantage of the high prices to sell heavily, and spot traders also fiercely sold in succession, so it retreated to 5,054 yuan. Later, money exchange businesses suddenly bought in, and securities traders also turned from selling to buying, so it rose again to 5,080 yuan, but spot traders saw the opportunity to sell again, and silver shop businesses slightly sold, and the US exchange rate also hardened at that time, down to a low price of 5,050 yuan. At noon, a certain silver shop bought in cheaply, so by the time of noon closing, it was still at 5,065 yuan. As a result, it squeezed up 32 yuan. The outside potential was still good in the afternoon, and the final price was 5,070 yuan. Trading was still brisk for half a day, about 3,000 taels or so. Gold jewelry in silver shops was initially high and then low, ultimately remaining flat. Customs gold and other items remained fixed.

Spot Gold Rises by 32 Yuan

Since the morning (per bar, ten taels), the initial opening was strong due to the tight US exchange rate and renewed confidence. The buying voices on the table were deafening, especially the money exchange businesses, which were even more eager to buy, and sellers temporarily stood aside to watch the situation. Therefore, it opened late until 9:30, jumping horizontally by 97 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 50 taels, at 5,130 yuan. Securities traders readily sold, and spot traders also scrambled to sell in succession, plus the exchange rate had already reported a hardening, the price suddenly turned sharply downward, and soon fell back 76 yuan. Securities traders sold 50 taels to money exchange businesses, at 5,054 yuan. After this, money exchange businesses suddenly bought in, and at the same time a certain securities business also turned from selling to buying, so it pulled up another 26 yuan. A silver shop bought 30 taels from a money exchange business, at 5,080 yuan. Then the US exchange rate continued to report hardening, and silver shop businesses resumed selling, and at the same time silver shop businesses also sold, and it fell back another 30 yuan. A gold shop sold 20 taels to a certain silver shop, at 5,050 yuan. At noon, short sellers in the securities business made peace and covered their positions, and again raised the price by 18 yuan. The securities business did 50 taels, at 5,068 yuan. Then a silver shop business sold 50 taels to a silver shop, at 5,065 yuan as the noon closing price. As a result, it squeezed up 32 yuan compared to the previous day. The range was 80 yuan for half a day. The selling price of the spot traders' gold was several yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Gold Jewelry Initially High and Then Low

Silver shop gold jewelry, per tael, was still listed at 510 yuan by Da Tong Heng at the beginning. At 9:40, it was raised by 5 yuan, and at 10:20, it fell back by a small 5 yuan. There were no changes after this, ultimately remaining flat. Da Tong Heng still listed at 510 yuan, and the new counterparts were the same as the above price, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Major Foreign Exchange Players Rarely Act

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, trading fluctuations were narrow throughout the half-day, indicating a stable underlying trend. Speculators and major players largely remained on the sidelines, rarely acting. However, many smaller holders, taking advantage of this lull, were willing to sell, resulting in the final prices being roughly the same as the previous night's close, with no clear gains or losses. Initially, overseas British and American exchange rates continued to narrow by seventy-five points, causing the opening market to show a stable British pound and a tight US dollar, quoted at 4/16 1/8士 (shì) 125 and 6.34375 yuan respectively. Subsequently, due to a lack of supply of US dollars from foreign banks, the market quietly tightened again, reaching 6.325 yuan. Later, speculators, taking profits from their floating gains, frequently sold off, and American banks showed a stronger willingness to sell, gradually leveling the market. By the close, British gold 4/16 1/8士 (shì) 125 and US dollars 6.375 yuan, were similar to the previous day. Futures prices hardened slightly, and swaps narrowed slightly.

British and American Futures Narrow

At the start of the morning, London's large contracts, both near and far terms, increased by twenty-five points. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold prices remained stable. Exchange rates for the British pound against Shanghai, France, and other currencies were flat. The US dollar narrowed by seventy-five points against the British pound, fell by one dime against Shanghai, and fell slightly against France. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened for spot trading in the morning with British gold at 4/16 1/8士 (shì) 125 and British exchange at 6.34375 yuan, a stable British pound and tight US dollar by 0.03125 compared to the previous close, due to the continued decline in exchange rates. After opening, due to a lack of selling interest from foreign banks, the US dollar continued to soften quietly, with spot trading only possible at 6.3125 yuan, but transactions were rare. HSBC's listed prices were announced unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced at one and a half points higher. Thereafter, Chinese merchants, taking advantage of the high prices, sold this month's US dollar contracts to foreign banks at 6.3125 yuan. Subsequently, a certain Chinese bank, acting on behalf of Hong Kong interests, bought British pounds and sold US dollars, absorbing this month's British gold at 4/16士 (shì) 0.078125 and simultaneously selling this month's US dollars at 6.34375 yuan, arbitraging the British-American exchange rate at approximately 3.7325 yuan. Around 10:15 AM, speculators continued to sell, and American banks also showed a willingness to supply, causing the market to return to normal. A certain bank sold next month's US dollar contracts to foreign firms at 6.21875 yuan and sold May British gold contracts to Japanese firms at 3/16士 (shì) 0.984375. Later, Chinese merchants again sold this month's US dollar contracts to Cargill and other firms at 6.275 yuan, and next month's US dollar contracts at 6.25 yuan. As a result, futures trading weakened slightly, and transactions gradually cleared up at noon, creating a very quiet situation. By the close, British gold was at 4/16士 (shì) 125, US dollars at 6.375 yuan, this month's British gold at 4/16士 (shì) 0.09375, US dollars at 6.34375 yuan, next month's British gold at 4/16士 (shì) 46875, and US dollars at 6.25 yuan. The final result was that spot prices for British and American currencies were unchanged from the previous day, while this month's futures for British pounds rose by 0.015625 and US dollars hardened by 0.03125, next month's contracts fell significantly by 0.03225 and US dollars fell by 0.0625. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Hong Kong US Dollar Weakens

Hong Kong, 16th (Saturday) dispatch: This morning, the exchange market opened with a stable British pound and a volatile US dollar. British pound and US dollar counter prices remained unchanged. Spot Shanghai exchange rose by 25 cents, to 359.35 yuan. Spot Japanese exchange weakened by 50 cents, to 96.50 yuan. At 10:10 AM, the US dollar showed a slight hardening trend, with spot weakening by 0.0625, to 22.875 yuan, and forward opening at 22.8125 yuan. At 10:50 AM, it stabilized, with the US dollar spot continuing to weaken by 0.0625, to 22.9275 yuan, while forward remained unchanged, still opening at 22.8125 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was reported as flat, with no changes in any exchange rates. The market was stable at the noon close, with the US dollar spot weakening again by 0.0625, to 21.3 yuan, and forward still standing at the original level. Spot Shanghai exchange continued to decline by 75 cents, to 358.5 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Tianjin British and American Currencies Rise

Tianjin, 26th (Saturday) dispatch: This morning, the exchange market opened flat. Spot British exchange weakened slightly by 0.03125, to 3 pence 8125. Spot US exchange rose by 0.09375, to 5.905 yuan. Shanghai exchange fell by 1 yuan, to 107.50 yuan. The unofficial market for "Joint Currency" also rose by 1 yuan, to 1.05 yuan.

US Dollar Notes Rise in the Morning, Fall in the Afternoon

Yesterday's foreign currency market remained volatile, especially for US dollar notes. In the early morning, foreign exchange was reported tight, with strong demand from dealers. Market bonds even rose to 15.76 yuan. Later, a Hong Kong telegram suddenly reported the purchase of British pounds and sale of US dollars, undoubtedly indicating hopes for a turnaround in today's London telegraphic exchange rate, and those taking profits rushed to sell. By late morning, it had retreated to 15.53 yuan, and further declined to 48 cents in the afternoon, eventually settling at 15.50 yuan. The result showed no significant difference from the previous day's price. Conversely, British gold notes gradually gained favor, while Hong Kong notes and notes from Singapore, the Netherlands, Annam, Robbie, Canada, and the Philippines showed a weakening trend. The underlying trend for British and American gold pounds remained stable. The decline in Japanese gold notes and Korean notes was quelled, with the former rising to 1.30 yuan and the latter rising to 0.99 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw an increase of five points for British leftover notes, and a decrease of five points for Hong Kong notes and notes from Singapore, the Netherlands, Annam, Robbie, Canada, and the Philippines, while all others remained unchanged.

### Food Grains Rice Prices Fall Frequently

Yesterday's rice market continued to see a decline in prices. Although sentiment was still firm in the early morning, with hoarders reluctant to sell easily, the continuous arrival of large quantities of imported rice on the way made it unlikely that the market would rebound in the short term. Speculators and original merchants alike also released their holdings, causing the market to decline further. As a result, prices for various goods fell again by half a yuan to one yuan, while overall trading volume remained low, with no more than three to four thousand bags traded. Original-packed No. 2 Saigon rice was priced at 47.50 yuan, and small-lot rice was priced at 47 yuan. After more than three hundred tons were released, there were few buyers, resulting in a price reduction of two, three, or four cents for spot rice, and futures also showed a weak trend.

The demand for glutinous rice was already small, and in the current environment, sellers were unable to maintain prices and lowered them by around half a yuan. Although the arrival of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica and early and late indica varieties has been limited in recent days, with only three to five hundred bags transferred from Hongkou yesterday, the continuous decline in imported rice prices inevitably had a restraining effect, leading to even quieter trading in the unofficial market, and prices continued to fall by one yuan. High-quality japonica was only priced at 47-48 yuan, medium-quality rice at only 44-45 yuan, and special thin indica at 45-46 yuan.

### Flour and Wheat Sales Were Sluggish

Yesterday's flour market was quite weak. Since the lifting of the export ban, sales have been inactive. Tianjin and Beijing have already purchased large quantities of flour from Japan, Manchuria, and Australia, and the authorities are paying close attention to the market for returned goods. As a result, mills are repeatedly urging the pickup of their warehouse receipts, and holders are unable to fully manipulate the market. However, with current imported wheat prices at 35 yuan, the calculated flour price is above 14 yuan per bag, so the market may not be too weak. Unified market prices opened at 14.35 to 14.37 yuan for old car brands, and 14 yuan for Battleship brand, down slightly by one or two cents from before. There were no other official prices.

Wheat also showed weakness yesterday. The weak trend in the flour market and the repeated declines in rice prices both affected the wheat market. Suzhou wheat opened at 24.15 yuan, and Changzhou-Wuxi wheat opened at 14 yuan, down another five or six cents from before. A total of five or six truckloads were traded.

### Securities New Business Regulations of the Public Industry Association Domestic Debt Continues to Rise

The unofficial securities market remained firm yesterday. Expectations of actual benefits from Britain's verbal promises led to stronger defenses on the part of many. The losses caused by the previous tight foreign exchange and rising gold prices have now been more than recovered, and it is unlikely that there will be any significant changes in the short term. There is talk of adding disguised futures trading, but due to the involvement of too many parties, it is unlikely to materialize quickly. This has encouraged and comforted many, as it can avoid the burden of interest. Yesterday, foreign exchange and gold were both stable in the morning, which also stabilized public bonds. Type A and E saw slight increases, Type B and C remained flat, and Type D was not yet available. In the afternoon, demand from retail investors was strongest. Shun Kang Hongda also bought in significantly, while Jiufeng sold out significantly. Yichang and Xieda also made some sales, causing market prices to strengthen. As a result, prices rose again by about 10 to 20 cents, with a transaction volume of over 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing Price Compared to Previous Day

HSBC shares each rose half a pound, with British registered shares at 91.5 pounds and Hong Kong registered shares at 92 pounds. All others remained unchanged.

London, 15th (Friday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable, with no changes in any bonds.

### Yarn and Cotton Cantonese Sales Are Not Weak Major Cotton Yarn Players Continue to Buy

The yarn market remains firm, but some are selling due to the belief that the base price is already too high. However, many believe the outlook is good because factories are unwilling to release yarn, keeping the chips locked up, so market fluctuations are significant. Market trading is particularly active, and market prices fluctuate. At the same time, sales to Guangdong are also not weak. As a result, long position holders are still unwilling to give up their goods. The increase in trading of April Double Horse yarn, the price opened today at 980 yuan, and closed at 992 yuan. Currently, the prices of 32-count and 42-count yarns are very high, and 20-count yarn is also related, so there are more buyers.

Spot yarn opened in the morning, continuing the weak momentum from the previous day, with the opening price at 956 yuan. As soon as this price was announced, buyers flocked in, but in reality, they were all short-covering traders. In an instant, it rose to 970 yuan, and those taking profits sold off, causing it to fall back a few yuan. Later, it was heard that Guangdong's demand for Double Horse yarn remained strong, and major players were buying in, causing the market to slowly rise to 971 yuan at the close. Afterwards, it rose again. The half-day trading volume was 2,285 bales. Spot prices for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 2 yuan. The amount purchased by each group is listed below.

### Ordering Is Now Cost-Effective Foreign Cotton Trading Is Particularly Active Over 10,000 Bales of Yao Cotton Arrive Again

Trading in domestic cotton remains strong, but trading in American and Indian cotton is more active. This is because ordering is more cost-effective, and domestic cotton inventory is not high, and procurement is difficult. As a result, foreign cotton trading has increased. The source from northern Jiangsu is 707 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The current spot cotton trading situation is listed below.

In other news, foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was very quiet yesterday, with little trading among dealers. New Orleans was buying, and the closing prices were unchanged from the previous day for near-term contracts, and down three or four pounds for far-term contracts. India was predicted to rise by 2 rupees. Egypt's market was closed.

The trading of foreign cotton orders at Shanghai ports has been quite dull recently. All parties are exhibiting exceptional quiescence because of the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations. Mills ultimately find that buying cotton and spinning yarn results in too much cost loss, so they are temporarily unwilling to release cotton yarn to offset the cost of cotton. As a result, trading is sluggish. Japanese manufacturers are also very quiet. The factory price for cotton at yesterday's market, converted at an exchange rate of 6.375 yuan per US dollar, is as follows:

A batch of cotton purchased by American Hengda Foreign Company in eastern Zhejiang arrived yesterday morning on the Taikoo Company's Huangpu vessel from Ningbo, totaling 10,985 bales. It arrived at the port at around 7:00 AM yesterday and docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession, where it is being unloaded. It is said that after unloading the cotton from this vessel, it will continue to Ningbo to load more.

### Piece Goods Dyeing and Printing Factories Adopt Domestic Cloth in Large Quantities South Seas Restrict Import Quotas

The cloth market is very stable. Although export business to foreign countries has sharply decreased due to increasingly strict import quota restrictions in various parts of the South Seas, domestic sales to Zhejiang, Fujian, Yunnan, and Guangdong have suddenly increased. Dyeing factories and textile mills are adopting it in large quantities, and the supply and demand of gray cloth from wooden mills are quite responsive. As a result, domestic white cloth has been more popular than eastern piece goods recently. Yesterday, prices were stable. The wooden street traded over 300 pieces of fine cloth, twill, Ewo coarse cloth, and light-colored cloth. Zhejiang and Fujian buyers purchased over 200 pieces. Guangdong buyers purchased colored cloth, poplin, and printed cloth totaling over 100 pieces. Yunnan buyers purchased over 3,000 pieces of shirting, melton, etc. Northern Anhui, Bengbu, and southern Anhui, Wuhu, and other places purchased nearly 5,000 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, poplin, etc.

Yesterday's increase in the eastern cloth market was slightly restrained. The hoarding of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was affected by the increased rent of old warehouse receipts, and traders intended to close up, so buying became weak, and prices were shouted down by 1.5 cents per piece. The market once fell below 28 yuan, but new warehouse receipts still required 28.15 yuan. Wholesale sales of mid-range fine cloth and fine twill are very strong. Sales prices are generally stable. Because the Four Gentlemen's serge is in short supply due to the collection of spot goods by merchants from this street and Hankou, the market has opened for sale at 8.525 cents per yard.

### Raincoat Cloth Is Expensive

Sales of raincoat cloth have been quite sluggish recently, but the market remains firm, due to limited stock. Yesterday, 4026 water repellent sold for 18.5 yuan per bale, Tianjin plain colored for 1.5 yuan, non-Saigon double-sided yarn for 3.8 yuan, first grade for 3.95 yuan, suede first grade for 2 yuan, second grade for 1.67 yuan, British-made double-sided yarn raincoat cloth for 12.5 yuan, and fleece for 15 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Plunge by One Yuan

Yesterday's yellow bean market suddenly underwent a dramatic change, with prices plunging by over one yuan. This was due to the fact that some people were first affected by the environment, and second, by the decline of bean oil by 1.3 yuan, leading to a sharp contraction in buying interest, and many bulls rushing to sell. However, there were few buyers. Although some bought in at low prices along the way, causing the market to stabilize slightly, the supply was greater than the demand, making it difficult to sustain, and the result was still a fall. The overall market only traded 300 bags of Nanjing beans, priced at 12 yuan to 21.5 yuan, 700 bags of Wuhu beans, priced at 23 yuan to 22.4 yuan, one truckload of Yangzhou mountain beans, priced at 21 yuan, and 350 bags of Dingjiazhou beans, priced at 25.5 yuan to 25.3 yuan.

### Sugar Market Raw Sugar Continues to Weaken

Yesterday's sugar market trend was relatively flat. The association set the price for spot goods at 62.5 yuan, down 0.5 yuan for both new arrivals at local warehouses and those at foreign warehouses. Old goods remained unchanged at 62.1 yuan to 62 yuan. Re-export goods maintained their original prices. Taikoo granulated white sugar did not fluctuate much, with B Mark Western warehouse at 67.1 yuan, Eastern light at 66.5 yuan, and all others remained unchanged. Domestic products also showed a steady trend, with limited trading.

### Dried and Preserved Goods Superior Honey Dates Are Firm

The demand for honey dates has been average recently, so ordinary oil-dipped dates have been very sluggish, selling for less than 90 yuan. However, because the inventory of Anhui goods is thin, they are relatively firm, selling for 120 yuan to 115 yuan. Upward and downward adjustments are made as usual.

### Orchid Bamboo Branches Decline

Because sales of orchid bamboo branches have been hindered since a certain party crossed the river in eastern Zhejiang, they have been greatly affected. As a result, market prices have declined again recently, down two yuan yesterday. It will not be easy to rebound unless sales expand.

### On Mr. Ying Yongyu's Suggestion Defining the Scope of Payment Stoppage for Transfer Orders

Mr. Ying Yongyu of the banking community recently sent a letter to the Banking Association, stating that bank transfer orders are widely circulated because of their convenience in remittance, but there are frequent disputes over payment stoppage. For example, Shengji and Zhejiang Xingye Bank have been publishing advertisements questioning each other daily. Also, recently someone altered a 200 yuan transfer order from Chouzhou Bank to 20,000 yuan. In order to promote the circulation of negotiable instruments and avoid future disputes, it should be stipulated that the reporting of loss and stoppage of payment for transfer orders should be limited to cases of fire, theft, or loss in transit, and should not be arbitrarily stopped. Or it should be stipulated that transfer orders payable to the bearer should not be reported lost and stopped. As for the issuer, they should be more careful beforehand, and the amount on the check should be written in correct and capitalized characters, and there should not be too much space left between the characters. It is best to use a numbering machine to punch the amount on the check to ensure caution and prevent alteration.

### New Situation and the Raw Silk Industry

— Yi Zhi

Continued from the 13th

(III) Domestically, with the war progressing to a stalemate, the policy of "using war to sustain war" is bound to rely more and more on this, which will inevitably strengthen the pressure on the "control" of raw materials and the monopoly of the silk reeling industry. At the same time, the stalemate is characterized by more frequent fluid warfare in the occupied areas than before, and the other side's "security force" is increasingly ineffective. These two points have made the issue of cocoon procurement more complex and difficult than before. The humiliation and losses of last year will be even less guaranteed this year. So, will China's raw silk industry be manipulated by others? Being manipulated by others means being monopolized by others, so how can we say that the new situation is beneficial to the raw silk industry?

Originally, it is not absolutely without benefits here. For example, the frequency of mobile warfare is detrimental to "control." Where "control" is unfavorable, the free trade against control is beneficial. At the same time, the more "using war to sustain war" is relied upon, the weaker the aggressor becomes. This weakness will certainly also be reflected in the "control" force, which is also beneficial to the raw silk industry. Moreover, the phenomenon of the recovery of the silk industry in Shanghai in the past two years, whether someone says it is morbid or adventurous, in fact, such a recovery has broken the "control" of others, restored their own strength, and accumulated funds for upward development. This is the most fortunate thing in the past two years, and it is also the most optimistic thing for the future. This is a prediction for the domestic situation this year.

In summary, domestically, "control" will inevitably be tightened, but its power is weakening. As for the silk industry itself, it can only survive in anti-control management. (Cooperation and standing by are conducive to the monopoly of others, and waiting to die. Therefore, whether in buying orchids or changing silk, it is necessary to adopt an economic guerrilla attitude, have the determination to take advantage of every opportunity, and have the patience to accumulate small victories to achieve big purchases. It is necessary to be active, courageous, and uncompromisingly loyal to the development of one's own business. Ethnic capital in the occupied areas of China can only do this, and can also take the road to a bright future.

The raw silk industry in the new situation has the above-mentioned advantages. From a general perspective, it is now following the progress of the country and is increasingly moving towards a favorable direction. However, at this time and place, it is necessary to grasp the above-mentioned principles, and it is necessary to jump out of the traps of speculation, adventure, compromise, and selfishness. It is necessary to narrow the scope, preserve strength, and actively strive for freedom of operation to break through the "control" conspiracy, so as to save more power to prepare for the grand development of tomorrow. (End)

Old Newspapers Newly Copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (1216) (See this newspaper from the twelfth year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty) A Record of a Western Magician Performing a Play

The night before last, I went with my wife to Jinguixuan, where I saw carriages and horses bustling and people as thick as weaving, it was the night that a Western magician was performing on stage. The stage was brightly lit, and a Western woman was on stage, playing Western music, and the harmony was loud and clear, making one yearn for it. Then, a lion's head was placed on the table, which could speak like a human being. A bright lamp was hanging under the table, and one could see that it was empty, and the audience already sighed at its magic! After entering the arena, suddenly, the lights on and off the stage were extinguished, and the double curtains behind the stage were opened. With the light on, looking closely behind the curtain, there was a Western painting, depicting the scenery in the ocean, and at first, a wheel slowly passed by, and the sails and figures in the boat were all round and lifelike. Western music was played again, and the painting slowly rolled back, but I saw the long sky connected to the water, with a round boat encountering the wind, the light flickering, with a black wind blowing the sea, the reader sighed at the spectacle. All the lights were on, and a beautiful woman leisurely came out with the magician. The magician's clothes were like a Chinese Taoist, helping the woman stand upright facing outward, and drawing a talisman on her face with his hand, and the beautiful woman fell asleep. He supported her arm with two sticks, the arm stood up and her feet hung in the air, and she was bent by the magician, and all was as desired. Later, he removed one stick, suddenly like a great immortal, suddenly like a swordsman, and the lights were also green, yellow, red, and green, changing in a non-uniform manner, and the audience was already surprised to have never seen it before. Suddenly, the magician chanted words, hugged the woman and lay down horizontally, and took away a stick, and the beautiful woman flew in the air, suspended in the air, and the people in the theater could not help but clap and cheer. After a while, the magician took the woman down, and drew another talisman, and the beautiful woman stretched and yawned and woke up, as if nothing had happened. It was staring bright, and the top of the theater suddenly fell down with flowing springs and broken jade, and the hanging beads were滔滔不絕, either as急如驟雨, or as 细若鸣嘶, about half an hour, it was a true spectacle.

### The Importance of "Learning" and "Asking"

— Jun Peng

—Do not be shy, do not be afraid of difficulty, do not be lazy—

The words "learning" and "asking" are linked and mutually supportive. No matter what subject we study, we must try our best to research it. For example, the most difficult and least progressive subject is writing. Why did I use this word and the teacher changed it? Why is this sentence not fluent? Why is the meaning too little? Why is it not on topic? Why can't I apply the sentences from the books I usually read? Why can't I express myself fluently? Also, like arithmetic, why can't I apply the formula? Why don't I understand this application problem? Why can this arithmetic problem be solved in this way or that way, and the answers are all correct? Children, have you ever thought about this? Have you ever asked yourselves? We should know that we must "think" beforehand, "think" out its principles, and be able to "apply" it. Otherwise, we are equal to "not learning." On the one hand, we must "work hard to learn," and on the other hand, we must "carefully ask." When "learning," we must listen attentively. When "asking," we must ask thoroughly. We cannot only know the how but not the why. The more we don't understand, the more we should ask. The more we ask, the more we will understand. However, only "learning" without "asking," or only "asking" without "learning," will not make progress, and there is no benefit. Perhaps the reason for your previous failure is this. The teacher works hard to explain, but the students still don't listen attentively. Even if they listen, they can't leave a deep impression on the brain. So you are like looking at flowers on horseback, meaningless. Or there are a few children who can read, memorize, and explain well, and the exam scores are very good, but they can't write well. This is because you can't read "living books" and apply "living books." You probably haven't asked the teacher what a "verb" is? What is an "adjective"? What is a "conjunction"? What is an "adverb"? What is a "pronoun"? Even if the teacher has explained it, you may not ask thoroughly. I think your writing scores are one of the worst subjects, and your other knowledge is not very good either!

Newton, seeing an apple falling from a tree, invented "gravity." Franklin, during snowfall, discovered the optical theory that white reflects and black absorbs light. Watt, seeing the kettle lid vibrating after the kettle boiled, invented the steam engine... These scientists all invented various "theories" because they "asked and learned a lot." I know that the reasons why you are unwilling to "ask" are nothing more than three: shyness, fear of difficulty, and laziness. So I hope that you quickly defeat these three "bad roots," and "learn" and "ask" at the same time, then your "learning" will improve every day!

### In Memoriam: Lord Baden-Powell, Founder of the Boy Scouts

— Yang Zi Jiang

March 15th is designated as the Chu Boy Scout Day, a day of great joy. However, this year, the unfortunate news of the passing of Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts, has arrived. Everyone who learns of this feels deeply saddened.

Mr. Baden-Powell was a native of London, England. As a child, he studied at a London elementary school, where he was not only diligent but also enjoyed sports. At the age of nineteen, he left school to serve in the military, holding important positions such as Lieutenant General and Inspector-General of Cavalry. In the second quarter of 1907, Mr. Baden-Powell gathered twenty-five children on Brownsea Island, camping outdoors and teaching them various life skills, as well as cultivating the virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. This marked the founding of the world's first Boy Scout troop. Later, Baden-Powell dedicated himself to the Boy Scout movement, establishing the Girl Guides, Cub Scouts, and Rover Scouts (an even higher level of Boy Scout training). These are now widespread in countries around the world. In 1929, the King of England awarded him a peerage for his contributions to Boy Scout education.

Since Mr. Baden-Powell founded the Boy Scouts, the organization has spread to over fifty countries, with a membership of over three million. Sadly, Mr. Baden-Powell passed away in Africa last year due to his advanced age. Boy Scouts around the world must feel a great sense of mourning upon hearing this news.

### Children's Health Competition

— Ying Dai

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Provincial Group Solicitation Committee will hold an entertainment fair at the New World Amusement Park starting from the 16th. Many entertainment acts will participate, and all ticket revenue will be donated to disaster relief. Many entertainment groups will participate, including Peking Opera, spoken drama, Shanghai opera, variety acts, etc. What we want to highlight here is that a children's health competition will also be held simultaneously.

According to the organizing committee's regulations, children of Chinese nationality aged two to twelve, regardless of gender, can participate, with their actual age as the standard. Children participating in the competition must pay a registration fee of one yuan when registering. After receiving a registration certificate, they can enter the venue daily without additional charges. The registration office is located at No. 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road, within the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Provincial Group Solicitation Committee, and registration closes on the 15th. The general assembly will open on the 16th, and the competition will be held for five consecutive days starting on the 17th. After the competition, the results will be announced on the sixth day, and prize money and gifts will be awarded.

The judges and inspectors for the competition will be the doctors of the Shanghai Relief Branch's health group, invited by the association. The cash prizes and gifts are awarded as follows: first place (one person) will receive 100 yuan in national currency; second place (two people) will each receive 30 yuan; third place (ten people) will each receive 5 yuan; fourth place (fifty people) will each receive children's products worth three yuan. All other participating children will receive children's products and toys as appropriate. In addition to direct registration with the association, various schools are also encouraging elementary school students to register, so the number of participants is expected to be quite high.

Children, you probably all know that health is very important. With a healthy body, you will be able to shoulder important responsibilities when you grow up. In the city of Shanghai, children's health competitions are often held. If you have the opportunity, even if your parents are not prepared to take you to participate, you can ask your parents to register you. If you win a prize, it proves that your body is quite healthy. From then on, you should maintain this health permanently and even improve it. If you rank very low, it proves that your body is not very healthy. Then you should pay attention to hygiene and correct the shortcomings of your health. Therefore, participating in children's health competitions is very beneficial. I hope everyone will not neglect this matter!

### Brushstrokes

— By Zhang Ziying

### Black Brothers (10)

— Yi Mu

Such a beautiful morning, even without searching for the Golden River, could make one happy. Along the Han Valley, layers of mist spread out, and beyond the mist, towering mountains rose – their lower cliffs shrouded in pale gray shadows, almost indiscernible. But as the mist gradually dispersed, the cliffs touched the sunlight, revealing a distinct red hue. The beams of light further illuminated the pine trees, like spears, a vibrant green that caught the eye. Higher above, the red rocks were illuminated, jagged and transformed into various shapes. Patches of snow were scattered everywhere, shimmering in the sunlight. In the far distance, towering above everything else, fainter than the morning clouds, yet clear and still, lay the snow-capped peaks, resting in the azure sky.

The Golden River, leaping from the lower, snowless heights, was almost enveloped in dark clouds. In the highest part, something resembling floating water flowers slowly extended like smoke and mist above the waterfall, then drifted away in the morning breeze.

Hans's eyes and thoughts were completely focused on it. He forgot the distance and walked quickly, but before he had crossed a range of lower hills, he already felt very tired. What surprised him even more was that on these hills, he discovered a large glacier, lying across his path between him and the source of the Golden River, separating them. He bravely walked onto the surface of the river, intending to cross to the other side, the first time in his life he had crossed such a dangerous glacier. The ice surface of the river was very smooth, and the sound of rushing water often came from the cracks in the ice. This sound was not low and monotonous but very loud and constantly changing, especially loud, like someone singing wildly, then falling low into short, melancholy sounds, sometimes like people groaning in pain. Where Hans passed, the ice broke into thousands of chaotic pieces, each with a different shape. To his eyes, they did not seem like ordinary ice blocks but like strangely shaped human faces mocking him. From these countless broken ice pieces, thousands of pale rays of light flashed, dazzling his eyes. And after hearing the continuous sound of rushing water, his ears seemed numb, and his head seemed dizzy. He walked forward step by step, increasing his pain. New cracks kept appearing under his feet, and he heard the ice blocks falling like thunder. In this dangerous environment, he was terrified. He barely escaped the last crack and collapsed, exhausted, on the grassy soil at the foot of the mountain on the other side.

In his confusion while crossing the glacier, he had already dropped his food basket. Now he had nothing to eat but to pick up pieces of broken ice and chew them. This way, he did not feel thirsty. After resting for a full hour, he barely regained his strength. Driven by greed, he hurried onward.

### Anecdotes about Orange Fun

— Jun Mei

During the Qing Dynasty, the inner court had dedicated positions for various artisans. Recent people know only about the actors, but during the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, after a long period of peace, specialized teams were established for all arts that could delight the heart and mind, and cultivate character. Famous masters were recruited and given honorary positions, not just limited to drama. As recorded in Qing Dynasty anecdotes: "During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, court officials were fond of chess. Chess masters from all over gathered in the capital. Huang Longshi and Xu Xingyou were both appointed as inner court attendants." This shows that Xu was Huang's disciple. Huang was superior to Xu in age and skill, but Xu surpassed Huang in cunning and trickery. When they served in the inner court, Xu even managed to obtain an official position through this. The story is quite interesting. Xu cultivated connections with the inner eunuchs and knew everything that happened in the inner court in advance. One day, Xu visited Huang and said: "Your chess skills are truly superior to mine. However, you have won many games. How about you let me win by a small margin in front of the emperor, so I can save face for one day?" Huang smiled and agreed. When the time came, the emperor pointed to a gilded red box on the table and said: "Whoever wins will get what's inside." Huang thought it was a common reward. After the game, Huang lost. The emperor smiled and sighed, saying to Huang: "Although your chess skills are better than his, your fate is not as good as his!" He ordered the eunuch to open the box, and inside was a document appointing Xu as a prefect. Huang was stunned, watching Xu kowtow and express his thanks. Xu had already been informed by the eunuchs in advance, so Huang fell into his trap. Obtaining an official position through chess is indeed an interesting story.

After Xu, the most famous chess players were the "Four National Masters" Liang, Cheng, Shi, and Fan. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, there were the so-called "Eighteen National Masters." At that time, the imperial court was in decline, and the customs were deteriorating. Those who called themselves "National Masters" all sought favor with powerful officials. Only Li Zhanyuan from Nantong and Zhou Xiaosong from Jiangdu did not follow the trend. Zhanyuan was one of the "Eighteen National Masters." He usually wore a turban and went barefoot, playing chess with princes and dignitaries without showing any weakness. Someone secretly tried to bribe him, but he remained the same, even shouting loudly: "I will not accept bribes, why do you offer this!" People could do nothing about it. Xiaosong once played chess with Zeng Xiangxiang. Zeng intended to give him a generous gift, but during the game, Xiaosong gave Zeng nine pieces, tearing his formation into nine pieces, barely surviving. Zeng was furious and refused to give him a single coin. There was a chess enthusiast whose skills were not very good. He suffered from scabies that never healed. When he was about to lose a game, he would lean half his body on the table, and the scabies would itch even more, filling the table with skin flakes, which disgusted everyone.

Chess can cultivate character, but it can also be detrimental to one's lifespan due to scheming and exhausting mental energy. Therefore, few chess enthusiasts live to a ripe old age. Monk Qiuhang, also a contemporary national master, was 119 years old in the Tongzhi Guihai year. He enjoyed the scenery of West Lake and traveled to Hangzhou with Chen Bomin from Jinling. In January of the following year, he suddenly bid farewell to his companions, saying he was returning west. His friends gave him a farewell feast on the day before the Lantern Festival. That day, they cheered and drank merrily, and he played chess with everyone. After the game, he put the pieces into the scale and said: "Today's gathering is hard to come by again, and this game is the best." The crowd did not understand, but he did not explain and left. The next day, it was reported that Qiuhang had passed away. For a chess master to reach the age of 120 is probably unprecedented, and to pass away immediately after finishing a game, is this not the Buddhist concept of "chess liberation" within "corpse liberation"?

### Errol Flynn's Gold Fever

— Hua Zhi

Hollywood actresses are collectively known as "Gold Diggers," a well-known term. But recently, a "Gold Digger Hero" has emerged, that is Errol Flynn, the martial arts star famous for "The Charge of the Light Brigade," "The Adventures of Robin Hood," and "The Prince and the Pauper," who was recently elected as the Sixth Throne.

Although Errol Flynn has a penchant for gold digging, he has never succeeded. Each time he has lost a lot of money. The first time, someone suggested to him that there was a gold mine on the island of Alaska in the Pacific Ocean. The ore had already been discovered, but it lacked capital for further exploration. He was eager to try and provided that person with US$10,000 and an airplane worth US$7,000. Soon after, this person returned from the investigation, having used up all the money, and the gold mine had not been found. He had to take back the plane. But Errol Flynn was not discouraged. The second time, he traveled to a small island in Cuba, South America. He heard that pirates had once caused trouble on the island. Once, a group of pirates, pursued by warships, fled to the shore, hiding the loot of pearls and treasures together in a cannon barrel, sinking it to the bottom of the sea, and then ran away. He was fascinated by such a legendary story. With much effort, he begged for help from many Americans and spent US$2,000, finally retrieving the cannon from the seabed. However, all that was in the cannon barrel were worthless pebbles worth less than US$200.

Most recently, Errol Flynn heard that Oak Island had been a pirate hideout in ancient times. Valuables worth millions of dollars were buried in the seabed one hundred and several tens of feet deep. For one hundred and fifty years, many people have been developing it, but the pits are often flooded by seawater, and there have been no results. He wanted to make one last bet and was in contact with a cooperative enterprise in Canada to buy a piece of land and carry out development, attempting to realize his golden dream.

### Twenty Kinds of Ballads

— Written by Dong Yun, illustrated by Xiu Yan

Fang Qing was a child of a noble family, but after being framed by treacherous officials, his family fortune declined! Furthermore, the magistrate of Xiangfu extorted grain, making the situation like a leaky house in the rain, with no peace anywhere! He and his mother went to Xiangyang to seek help from relatives. His aunt was snobbish and drove them away. Fortunately, his cousin was kind and encouraging, and before he left, she gave him a "Pearl Tower" as a "light refreshment." Three years later, he paid the price for his essays and his name was inscribed on the golden list! On the day of his triumphant return, he could not forget the hatred of the past, so he returned to Xiangyang and used Daoqing tunes to ridicule his aunt... Traditionally, the narration of the Pearl Tower ends here.

The Pearl Tower is one of the most successful ballad scripts.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Yiyun

Eight Stable Boys of Green Stone Mountain

Green Stone Mountain was originally an auspicious martial arts drama. The leading roles were not very demanding, but it was good in that the sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted-face male), and chou (clown) characters each had opportunities to show their strengths. It was truly a grand ensemble drama, so it felt very lively. One year, it happened that Xiao Lou came south, and also coincided with the Shanghai Five Troupe Grand Joint Charity Performance. At that time, several famous martial arts actors from the south were all in Shanghai, and the people assigning roles were really in a difficult position. So they came up with this "Complete Green Stone Mountain." Xiao Lou played Guan Ping, Yi Ganqi played the Nine-tailed Fox, Wang Yongli played Qu Cangzi, He Jinshou played Judge Wang, Yu Zhenting played Lu Zu, San Mazi played Guan Di, and Li Chunlai, Xia Yuerun, Zhao Ruquan, Gai Jiaotian, Zhao Xiaolian, Zhang Dejun, Ying Baolian, and Chen Junting, eight famous martial arts actors, played the eight stable boys. On the surface, it seemed to be supporting Xiao Lou, but in reality, it was still increasing the status of the Third Boss. Because the stable boys followed the Holy Emperor out onto the stage, and when Guan Gong came on stage, these eight brave, short-hitting martial arts actors flipped somersaults before and behind the horse, making the eyes of the audience below the stage dizzy. If the stage of the Grand Theater had not been large, these reckless men would almost have flipped off the stage. In terms of the age of these eight people, Chunlai was the oldest (if he were still alive today, he would be around eighty years old). Next was Zhao Junyu's father, Xiaolian, who is still alive today and is seventy years old this year. Next were Xia Laoba (Yuerun), Zhang Dejun, Gai Jiaotian, and Zhao Ruquan. At that time, Chen Junting and Ying Baolian were the youngest, but now they are all nearly sixty years old. Time flies, and in a blink of an eye, it has been thirty years. Those who once dominated the stage are now white-haired old men, or have already passed away, truly giving one a sense of the vicissitudes of life.

Shen Bao Weekly Supplement Cai Yuanpei Special Issue, No. 29

### Various Characteristics of Mr. Cai Yuanpei

— Cai Shangsi

Introduction

Mr. Cai Jiemin passed away in Hong Kong on March 5th of this year! Because I often discussed academic matters with him after leaving Peking University, I know everything about him very well. The ancients considered establishing virtue, rendering meritorious service, and establishing words as the three imperishable achievements. Being able to achieve even one of them was considered difficult. Now, Mr. Cai excelled in all three, which is extremely rare in Chinese history. He is not only worthy of being called a "Grand Master of an Era." Now, I will try to briefly describe his various characteristics as a memorial and a cry!

Academic Aspect

Regarding this aspect, it is now divided into four points, described on the left:

(1) Progress of Thought – Mr. Cai's thought was very progressive. In politics, he advocated the best politics for the greatest number and the greatest happiness (see his "Opinions on Educational Policy"), applying the international mutual aid doctrine (see "The Great War and Philosophy"). In economics, he advocated distributing property and socialism (see the ethics section below). In education, he advocated aesthetic education (see "Record of Words and Deeds of Mr. Cai Jiemin"), and independent education free from political parties and churches (see "New Education," Vol. 4, No. 3 and "Chinese Educational Circles," Vol. 11, No. 10). In ethics, he advocated evolutionary cosmopolitanism (see "The World and Outlook on Life") and absolute egalitarianism between men and women in morality and sexuality (see "Record of Words and Deeds of Mr. Cai Jiemin, A Brief Biography"). As late as April of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), at a dinner party hosted by the Legislative Yuan inviting all members of the Third National Education Conference, he still advocated "the ideal new village abolishing surnames, marriage, and family" (see "Shen Bao" and other newspapers of the same month and 19th day). Mr. Cai, as a respected elder statesman of the Party and the nation, was still advancing in thought in his old age. This is something that those whose thoughts grow old with age and shift with position can never hope to achieve. It also shows that he has always stood at the forefront of the times and never wanted to lag behind. This precisely demonstrates his consistent spirit and thorough understanding.

(2) Breadth of Learning – Mr. Cai was a Jinshi and Hanlin scholar of the late Qing Dynasty, so he was proficient in Chinese literature, philosophy, and other disciplines. Later, he studied in Germany and France, researching Western philosophy, aesthetics, history, literature, education, etc., and was awarded a doctoral degree. Among the books he translated and authored, those related to philosophy, ethics, and literature are the most numerous, and they were mostly published by the Commercial Press. His essays are scattered in various newspapers and magazines, and in "Record of Words and Deeds of Mr. Cai Jiemin."

(3) Earnestness of Research – Mr. Cai was very earnest in his scholarship and had a spirit of skepticism. For example, in his "History of Chinese Ethics" written in the late Qing Dynasty, he already regarded Yao and Shun as ideal figures of Confucianism. Later, he put even more effort into writing "A Search for the Hidden Meaning of The Story of the Stone," and discovered that "the author held a very strong nationalism, the book's events mourn the fall of the Ming and expose the failures of the Qing, and especially express regret for the Han Chinese literati who served the Qing." Furthermore, Lin Shu, a literary giant of the conservative faction, wrote to Mr. Cai, saying about Peking University: "Recently, there have been those who attack the new morality, denouncing parents as being driven by carnal desires, with no gratitude owed to them. I once saw these words in the writings of Yuan Mei and thought them inappropriate, denouncing Yuan Mei as mad. I never imagined that there would be scholars who would use them for lectures, causing people's heads to ring and making arguments unworthy of debate, 'they can be ignored.'" Mr. Cai replied, saying that the kind of argument that "denounces parents as being driven by carnal desires, with no gratitude owed to them" came from the biography of Kong Rong in the "Book of the Later Han," a false accusation made by Lu Cui against Kong Rong, and not from Yuan Suiyuan. From this, it can be seen that Mr. Cai was not like Lin Qinnan, who casually cited things and recklessly scolded people! The study of learning by general old scholars often neglects methods; but Mr. Cai did not think so, and very accurately recognized that method is more important than concrete knowledge (see Mr. Cai's preface to Cai Shangsi's "Methods of Research on Chinese Thought").

(4) Fairness of Attitude – Mr. Cai was very humble towards friends and students who were younger than him. Scholars such as Hu Shi were valued by Mr. Cai, and he often "did not disdain to ask questions" of his own students. For example, in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), when I was collecting "Historical Materials on China" in the Nanjing National Guoxue Library, I often went to the General Affairs Office of the Academia Sinica to see him. In order to be serious, he even asked me, "From which book and article do the words 'Your minister deserves to be punished, but the Heavenly King is wise' come from?" How humble this is! He was very concerned about the approximately three million words of "Historical Materials on Chinese Thought" that I had collected over the past ten years, and mentioned them frequently in letters after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Last year, after reading my book "Methods of Research on Chinese Thought," he also wrote to express his delight! My ability to make some contributions is largely due to Mr. Cai's encouragement. Furthermore, Mr. Liang Rengong's (Liang Qichao's) views and Mr. Cai's views were often very different, even opposite; but when Mr. Liang passed away, Mr. Cai, recognizing Mr. Liang's great contributions to scholarship, specifically proposed to the central government to issue an order of commendation (which was not adopted by the central government). This kind of selfless attitude is rare among contemporary scholars and important figures.

This is a treasured photograph of Mr. Cai from his early years. At that time, the Tokyo Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) was established, and Mr. Cai was introduced to the Tongmenghui by Mr. He Haiqiao. Later, he was also introduced to the assassination squad. Assassination required bombs, and Mr. Cai believed that this matter should involve someone proficient in chemistry for better results, so he introduced Mr. Zhong Xian to the association. Mr. Zhong was proficient in chemistry and could purchase instruments and chemicals at the science instrument hall without arousing suspicion. After the bombs were made, the lack of bomb casings was a regret. By coincidence, Mr. Huang Keqiang (Huang Xing), Mr. Kuai Ruomu, and others arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo one after another, bringing bomb casings. Finding that they could not be manufactured, they rented a house to devise methods for improvement, and tested more than ten pieces through his younger brother Yuan, which were detonated by Mr. Sun Shaohou in a remote place in Nanjing. Later, Mr. Yang Dusheng's organization studied every morning and evening, hoping to make bomb casings. Mr. Sun was responsible for the expenses of the organization, while Mr. Cai and Mr. Kang were in charge of the organization. At that time, Mr. Cai also introduced many people from his hometown to the association. When Mr. Yang Dusheng went north, he met Mr. Wu Yue in Baoding and they became close friends at first sight, and he introduced him to the association. Soon after, the five ministers who went abroad to investigate constitutionalism encountered China's first bomb at the station. The bomber was Wu Yue, and Mr. Cai knew that the bomb must have been made by Mr. Yang, so he was afraid that he would not be able to leave Beijing. Mr. Sun Shaohou then went north on some pretext to rescue him from danger. When Mr. Cai served as the principal of the Patriotic Girls' School, he instilled new ideas into the women's world and patiently guided them. Mr. Lan Cai was one of the earliest people to advocate for women's rights.

Meritorious Deeds

Regarding this aspect, it is obvious to everyone, so there is no need for me to talk much about it. To mention the essentials, there are the following three points:

(1) Educational Achievements – Mr. Cai's education was most successful. This kind of achievement was first manifested in National Peking University and later in National Academia Sinica. When he was the president of Peking University, he purely embraced talentism in regards to faculty and staff, only asking about academic ability and not qualifications or age. From restoration party members to communists, all could be accommodated; from Chinese learning to Western learning, all should be emphasized... In regards to students, he emphasized free research and specialized research, striving to make each have their own strengths and be useful. As a result, Peking University students occupied important positions in all fields of politics and education across the country. Mr. Cai also integrated educational politics, using the school to supervise the government and leading faculty and students to engage in activities, which resulted in the greatest "May Fourth Movement" in Chinese history. The reason why Peking University was able to become the leading institution of learning in China was also due to the above points. In short: without Mr. Cai, Peking University would not have been so great; without the great Peking University, Chinese education and culture would not have been so impressive today. Mr. Cai later served as the president of the Academia Sinica, striving for scientific undertakings, which was also very related to the construction of the new China.

(2) Political Achievements – After the establishment of the Republic of China, Mr. Cai first served as the Minister of Education of the Provisional Government; after the success of the National Revolution, Mr. Cai also first served as the Minister of Education of the National Government (at that time renamed the University Council). During his tenure, he created and established many things, and he was truly worthy of being the sole leader of educational administration since the Republic of China. In addition, he also served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, a member of the National Government, a standing committee member, the President of the Control Yuan, and the Minister of Justice.

(3) Revolutionary Achievements – In the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Cai and Zhang Taiyan, Wu Zhihui, and others ran newspapers to promote revolution and reject the Manchu Qing; later, he joined the Kuomintang to oppose the Northern Warlord government.

Personality Aspect

(1) Private Morality – Mr. Cai's life was very upright and simple. He did not have the common base hobbies; and in terms of housing, he never built a house of his own in a large city, which is the first point of difference from ordinary powerful people. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, although Mr. Cai has held important positions and his career has been quite smooth, he often resigned in anger for the sake of justice, or refused to take office in anger, which is the second point of difference from ordinary bureaucrats and politicians. Mr. Cai was very gentle and sincere, and would help as much as he could, responding to every request and not putting on airs, which is the third point of difference from ordinary people in positions of power. As for his selflessness, tolerance, generosity, and lack of sectarianism and emotional disputes, it has been briefly described in the above two sections on "Fairness of Attitude" and "Educational Achievements."

(2) Patriotism – Mr. Cai's revolutionary activities in the late Qing Dynasty and the May Fourth Movement were both motivated by patriotism. According to a report of Ren Hongjun's remarks, "The cause of this illness, although said to be old age and weakness, was mainly due to his concerns about national affairs... A few months ago, he still published a 'Manjianghong...Song,' expressing his deep love for the country in his words..." (See "Shen Bao," March 6).

(3) Human Rights – Mr. Cai was in the government, but his heart was with the people. Human rights were important, and personal gain was light. He was full of love for justice, upholding righteousness, and a spirit of fearlessness and willingness to sacrifice, which is truly immeasurable compared to those who aim to be officials and shift with their position!

### Mr. Cai's Last Words

Human obligation is to seek what is universally ethical and not to think about oneself; to think of the future instead of the present; to seek spiritual joy and not bodily enjoyment.

In all things, action is better than empty talk, and great things must start from small things.

Replace improper entertainment with proper entertainment, so that morality is not corrupted and the body benefits.

If people can dispel superstition and uphold rational belief, they can save themselves from meaningless pursuits and hopes, and focus their efforts on undertakings that benefit society, and make progress every day.

People are born with strengths and weaknesses because of unequal self-defense abilities, and people are born with poverty and wealth because of unequal self-preservation abilities. With strength and weakness, poverty and wealth, the concept of difference between self and others arises. The weak and the poor suffer from insufficient happiness, and the consciousness of seeking arises. With the existence of self and others, there are various divisions in the phenomenon, which violate the entity. And seeking, when it is not achieved, is endless pain, and when it is achieved, it is excessive demand, circulating in the phenomenon and separated from the entity. If it can be balanced, then the enjoyment of the flesh is purely natural, and the pursuit of the conscious world is avoided, and the concept of self and others is also transformed.

A society, whether small as a family or a shop, or large as a country, must have each person in this society have a sense of common destiny with the society, and deeply understand the nature of this society, and each fulfill a common responsibility, so that no one is not constantly learning, and there is no time when one should not learn.

Never take past achievements as merit, nor need to make useless regret for past losses. Set your mind, focus on increasing knowledge, cultivating morality, and exercising your body. If you have free time, you can serve society, bear the responsibility of guiding the common people, and prepare to solve the great problems of China in the future—which cannot be solved now.

Our country has long been known to the world as a sick man. To revitalize it, it must be through ever-new ideas, popularized to everyone, rather than relying on the fierceness of a single hand or foot.

If you isolate yourself and operate alone, you may be frozen and hungry, and it may be difficult to avoid it. By combining the strength of people in the industry to operate, a happy life and a civilized undertaking can be discussed.

The trend of civil rights is like a river breaking its banks, surging and unstoppable.

When Mr. Cai was the supervisor of the Sino-Western School, his wife died. Matchmakers came one after another to arrange a marriage for Mr. Cai. Mr. Cai put forward five conditions: (1) The woman must not bind her feet. (2) She must be literate. (3) The man does not take concubines. (4) After the man dies, the woman can remarry. (5) If the couple do not get along, they can divorce. At that time, the thinking was rigid, and after seeing the last two conditions, everyone retreated. After a year, he married Ms. Huang Shizhen, the daughter of Mr. Huang Erxuan. At the wedding, instead of hanging a painting of the Three Stars, a red banner with the two large characters "Confucius" was used instead. The wedding chamber was replaced by a lecture. Later, Ms. Huang also passed away. Mr. Cai then married Ms. Zhou Yangjuan. This is a photo of Mr. Cai and Zhou Yangjuan at their wedding.

### Mr. Cai Jiemin

— Gu Mei

——In Memory of a Pioneer of Social Education——

Since the news of Mr. Cai Jiemin's death spread, people at home and abroad have mourned in unison! Indeed, Mr. Cai has made many contributions to society, the country, education, and academia. Everyone mourns him, which is really an expression of commemorating his achievements. Standing in the position of social education, we feel even more that Mr. Cai is a pioneer of social education and needs to be deeply commemorated.

We see that China's social education has made considerable progress now, and when we think that there are still many undeveloped areas in China's social education, we feel that there is a need for a strong social education administrative agency to plan and promote it. And without knowing that when the Republic of China was established nineteen years ago, Mr. Cai had put a lot of effort into this point - firmly advocating the establishment of a Social Education Department in the Ministry of Education to be in charge of national social education administration.

During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Cai was still in Europe inspecting education. When he heard of the Wuchang Uprising, he returned to China immediately. When the Provisional Government of Nanjing was established, he took office as Minister of Education. Therefore, based on the results of his inspection abroad, he felt that the development of social education in various countries all relied on the power of educational administration to plan and promote it. Therefore, he firmly believed that the responsibility of educational administration was not only to educate young people within schools, but also to take into account the majority of older out-of-school adults. Therefore, when drafting the official system (the organizational law of the Ministry of Education), he firmly advocated the establishment of a Social Education Department in addition to the traditional General Education Department and Specialized Education Department, to be in charge of social education administrative affairs, in order to plan and promote national social education and correct the malpractices of the past lopsided development of education (especially focusing on school education). Later, although this system was partially revised by the Senate, it was generally passed, and a Social Education Department was established in the Ministry of Education to be specifically in charge of social education, which has been passed down to the present and can promote national social education and develop together with school education. This point is indeed Mr. Cai's contribution, and we cannot but remember him.

Naturally, we remember Mr. Cai's contribution to establishing the Social Education Department, not because he could "set up official positions and salaries" to support many section chiefs and clerks; but because there is a specialized social education administrative agency in charge, it can use administrative power to develop social education, so that millions of people across the country who do not have the opportunity to go to school can receive a little education, especially out-of-school adult civilians. For example, the implementation of remedial education for out-of-school adult civilians in various provinces and cities in recent years has been entirely driven by the Social Education Department; the most obvious is that planning, raising funds, training personnel, supervision, and guidance all rely on the power of the social education administrative agency to be carried out. And the creation of this administrative agency is Mr. Cai's contribution.

In addition, Mr. Cai also made great contributions to the language reform of the people. For example, the phonetic alphabet in the early Republic of China, the national language research in the sixth year of the Republic of China, and the national language Romanization in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, he has done his best to gradually reform the language of the people to the point where it is easy to learn. This point is also a major issue in China's social education, and Mr. Cai has already paid attention to it and tried his best to find ways to reform it.

Mr. Cai has made the same contributions to Chinese social education, so after the establishment of the Chinese Social Education Society in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, he was recommended as an honorary director, expressing his contribution to social education. Now that Mr. Cai has passed away, we colleagues in the social education field should have a deeper level of commemoration.

### Mr. Cai Jiemin and Peking University

— Qiao

Mr. Cai's relationship with Peking University began in the fifth year of the Republic of China. At that time, Mr. Cai was still in France, and was summoned back to China by the Ministry of Education to serve as the president of Peking University. Because the public opinion of Peking University at that time was really too bad, and the internal situation was really too corrupt, it was impossible without Mr. Cai coming back to rectify it. At the same time, Mr. Cai also agreed to take on this important task despite the difficulties and hardships. And he hired Mr. Chen Zhongfu (Duxiu) as the dean of the Faculty of Arts, Mr. Xia Fuyun as the dean of the Faculty of Science, and Mr. Shen Yinmo, Mr. Liu Bannong and others as professors.

The first thing Mr. Cai did at Peking University was to "reform students' concepts," because Peking University students had always been accustomed to not having any interest in learning. They only waited until the school years were over to get a graduation diploma, and especially focused on the career prospects after graduation. This was of course a huge mistake, so when Mr. Cai gave his first speech at the school, he explained: "University students should regard academic research as their vocation, and should not regard the university as a ladder to promotion and wealth."

Peking University was originally established with five departments: arts, science, engineering, law, and commerce. At that time, Peiyang University also had engineering and law departments. In addition, there was also a national industrial vocational school in Beijing. Mr. Cai believed that there was no need for this duplication, so he advocated that the engineering department of Peking University be merged into Peiyang, and the law department of Peiyang be discontinued immediately. Later, after several discussions, with the consent of the president of Peiyang University and the approval of the Ministry of Education, the civil engineering and mining engineering departments of Peking University were merged into Peiyang University.

Mr. Cai once said: "Students in school should take learning as their greatest purpose and should not have any political organizations. Those who are twenty years old or older and have a special interest in politics can participate in political groups in their individual capacity without involving the school." So indeed, on May 4th of the eighth year of the Republic of China, Beijing students had the idea of not signing the Treaty of Paris and dismissing the pro-Japanese faction Cao, Lu, and Zhang, which led to the May Fourth Student Movement known throughout the country. At that time, Mr. Cai resigned because he was suspected of maintaining the status of the students in the movement. However, after the May Fourth Movement was completed and everything had subsided, only the issue of the resignation of the president of Peking University caused disputes again. After several months of back and forth, although the government appointed Mr. Hu Cishan as the successor, he was opposed by the students, and as a result, Mr. Cai agreed to resume his post, and the dispute was resolved.

Another thing that Mr. Cai did at Peking University that opened a new era in academia was coeducation; Mr. Cai advocated equality between men and women; in the ninth year of the Republic of China, female students requested to enter the school, so Peking University officially recruited female students during the summer vacation. Immediately afterwards, many people asked Mr. Cai: "Coeducation is a new method, why didn't you ask the Ministry of Education for approval first?" Mr. Cai replied: "The Ministry of Education does not have a special regulation for universities to only enroll male students. In the past, female students did not request to enroll, so there were no female students. Now that female students have requested to enter the school, and their level is not weaker than that of male students, the university has no reason to refuse." The trend of coeducation began at that time.

### Anecdotes of Mr. Cai Jiemin

— Mi Ruozhuo

In the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Cai followed the Premier, traveled around the world, promoted revolution, and organized the Restoration Society with Xu Xilin, Zhang Taiyan, Qiu Jin, and others, and set the slogan: "The source of the Yellow River traces the Zhejiang tide, defend our Chinese Han people, do not let the Manchu Hu leave a piece of armor, the descendants of Xuanyuan are the pride of heaven." In the first year of the Republic of China, the revolution was successful, and Mr. Cai served as the Minister of Education, and was especially valued by people at the time. Officials and others came to pay their respects and congratulations; there were several congratulatory guests dressed in smart formal wear, just about to enter the door to congratulate, when they saw Mr. Cai come out to greet them. Mr. Cai himself was wearing a short coat, and both hands were stained with soap foam, wiping as he greeted them. At this time, the congratulatory guests felt quite embarrassed, with embarrassment all over their faces. Mr. Cai had already understood and said, "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, thank you all, please sit inside; I have nothing to do, so I'm just doing old things again and casually washing clothes (because Mr. Cai washed his own clothes when he was studying), but it's hard for you all." Seeing this, we could not help but immediately think of Mr. Cai's often said phrase "Labor is sacred."

The communication between the battlefields is smooth.

### An Unusual Army on the Hangping Road: The Economic Anti-Blockade Patrol

— Ye Zhou

I initially discovered this "unusual army" between the Huangwanjiao and Liyan areas along the Hangping Highway, arousing my suspicion: Could it be a "regular army?" No, a regular army should have a well-organized appearance! Could it be a "guerrilla force?" Again, no, they didn't seem accustomed to "fighting in battle!" Perhaps it was a "Youth Corps" or "Boy Scouts?" But I immediately noticed that it consisted of both old and young!

Driven by my suspicion, I chased this "unusual army," passing the former site of Huangwan Elementary School, past the silk factory, cutting through the outskirts of Huangwan Town, and traveling more than a mile at a brisk pace. When they stopped at the salt fields by the Huangwan coast, I stopped as well. I saw a large flag planted in the damp salt mud, bearing the words: "Economic Anti-Blockade Patrol," and a smaller line of text beside it: "Zhexi Eleventh Detachment, Fifth Squad."

I quietly greeted a kind-looking young man and asked in a low voice:

"Does this patrol team come often?"

He looked at me with suspicion and was unwilling to answer. I quickly declared, "Please rest assured! I am from this area myself and have only recently returned from Shanghai, so I am completely ignorant of everything happening in my hometown!" I spoke entirely in the Haining dialect.

He nodded and first asked me, "Do you know Mr. Zhang ×× of Huangwan Town?"

How could I not know him? You can ask around; he has always been a friend of mine.

"In that case, I'll tell you!" he said cautiously, "They come often, but it's not always the Fifth Squad that comes to Huangwan. I think it must be an organizational designation that is not limited to a specific area!"

Hearing him use terms like "designation" and "area," I couldn't help but ask with delight, "You must have attended middle school?" He first inquired about my name and then immediately said with a smile, "I knew your name long ago! My own name is Gu ××, and I studied at Haining County Middle School for over a year, but I didn't graduate."

I quickly said, "Could you tell me about the general situation of this patrol team?"

"Why not!" He pointed to a nearby salt kiln and said, "Let's go sit down and talk!"

Because I planned to rush back to Jiaoliyan in the morning, I urged him to tell me quickly. He reported to me in an orderly manner:

'After a portion of our Western Zhejiang fell, the Zhejiang Provincial Government immediately issued an order to all subordinate counties to organize "Economic Anti-Blockade Patrols." In the un-occupied counties, areas were divided and "Detachments" were established. Under the detachments were "Squads," and the general headquarters was located in Yuqian.

'Their mission is to thwart the Japanese economic blockade plot, prevent the secret transport of domestic resources into the "occupied areas" to be exploited by others, and also prevent inferior goods from the "occupied areas" from leaking into the interior market to be sold. Like the former "anti-smuggling teams" cracking down on "private salt," they patrol all the coastal defenses all day long to prevent any "leakage." When necessary, they need to use "armed suppression," so they also have "guns!"

'Their predecessors included reorganized anti-smuggling teams and reorganized defense corps, but most of them were ambitious young people and strong men who joined voluntarily. Therefore, there are quite a few "intellectuals" in these teams!

"Now, this movement has spread to all the occupied counties in our Western Zhejiang. In Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Pinghu, I heard that detachment headquarters have been established. Think about it, this team is the "Zhexi Twelfth Detachment, Fifth Squad." Presumably, the "guerrilla areas" in Western Zhejiang are a mix of loyalists and traitors, and the situation is more complicated, so several more detachment headquarters had to be established. Our Western Zhejiang has only "fallen" for fourteen counties and one city, so it seems that each county has a detachment headquarters! Or perhaps both our Haining County and the nearby Haiyan County have their respective detachment headquarters. Unfortunately, I rarely go out, so I cannot tell Mr. Zhang the details! But one detachment already has five squads, and I'm afraid there are more than that. With twenty people per squad, the strength of this patrol team is indeed considerable!"

I was extraordinarily pleased with this young man's articulate speech and analytical answers, which were invaluable. I asked again, "So, what happens to the seized smuggled goods and inferior goods?" He answered me succinctly, "Confiscated."

Before parting, I wanted to ask him why he dropped out of school. He sighed and said, "I have been out of school for many years! It has nothing to do with this war of resistance, but rather with the unbearable burden of family finances..."

On the way back, I kept thinking about this "Economic Anti-Blockade Patrol," and also about this sincere and lovely "promising young man."
