Editorial

### Basic Livelihood

The soaring prices of all goods, coupled with the contraction of foreign exchange, have deepened the difficulties of the people's lives and highlighted the depreciation of the legal tender. The poor fear they have nothing to live on, and the rich fear they will have nothing to sustain themselves. Forced into this situation, the pain is deeply felt, and a sense of unease fills the entire society. This is undeniable and impossible to conceal.

Analyzing the causes, deducing the consequences, seeking fundamental solutions, and devising emergency measures are inexhaustible topics. Although it is said that there is no harm in discussing them, what benefit can come from such discussions? Because this phenomenon is neither limited to one place nor one country. The difficulties in various countries and regions only differ in degree, and the arrival of these difficulties only differs in time. The difficulties felt by residents of Shanghai today are merely more severe and earlier than those in other countries and regions. Recalling the autumn and winter of the year before last (1938), Shanghai's industries flourished, creating a golden age that other places and other days had yet to experience. Less than two years have passed, and unease has replaced prosperity. Not to mention the year before last, even last year, industries were still rejoicing in profits due to the gradual rise in prices. Now, although industries continue to see prices climb, they cannot feel at ease and even feel pessimistic. The main problem lies in the severe shaking and disruption of the original order of the world situation. The shaking and disruption have affected not only warring countries and dangerous zones but also the United States, far across the Pacific, which is currently in a golden age. Even if it maintains neutrality and stays out of the vortex of war, it will eventually suffer terrible losses and pain due to the shaking and disruption of the war. This is the fate already determined for the United States. Looking at the phenomenon in Shanghai, which is like an isolated island, from the perspective of the promising future of the United States, which is unmatched in wealth and power, who can blame heaven or man for the sense of unease felt by residents of Shanghai today? Although life is difficult today, they should still feel at peace! When discussing its future, comparing our reality, perhaps we will hesitate and stammer. But in fact, although Shanghai has soaring prices and difficult living conditions, there are still countless people who admire Shanghai and hope to be residents of Shanghai, which is unattainable. Try to examine the recent newspaper and magazine reports: what is the life of Berlin residents like? What is the life of Tokyo residents like? There is a limited period for eating meat, and there are limited amounts of sugar and salt to be consumed. New clothes and shoes are not allowed to be worn. If one must buy new clothes and shoes, old clothes and shoes must be handed over to the government. Such fragmented reports are readily available. Rice, meat, and white goods are expensive in Shanghai, but in reality, except for those who have no proper way of life when prices are not expensive, if one changes from three meals a day to two, and from three or four bowls per meal to two or three, and from eating with a variety of dishes to plain rice and vegetables, then each person can save a few days' worth of expenses and may be able to taste meat. In short, the life of residents of Shanghai today is not as difficult as that of residents of Berlin and Tokyo. There is no black market for foreign exchange within Japan, and it is illegal to buy foreign exchange privately. The Japanese army is punished with severe penalties. In Shanghai, the black market price of legal tender has plummeted, but Japanese tickets have also fallen in value. Comparing this reality, we can be more calm.

After all, unease is an undeniable reality. The most commonly heard sighs and cries of sorrow are: "Commodity prices are rising, but human value is not rising." The implication is that people are not as valuable as goods, and that human value has fallen with the legal tender. We sympathize with the sincerity and pain of such sorrows and sighs. In fact, this is a limited perspective from one corner of Shanghai, misled by the present moment, and is an absolute illusion. Regarding this fundamental concept, this newspaper briefly explained the legal tender and national wealth of China yesterday, and I will not discuss it again today. I will now discuss it from the perspective of any individual.

In this world-shaking dramatic transformation, this historical dramatic transformation, anyone should know that the value of individual life is originally lower than usual. If life itself is like this, then the question of how to enjoy happiness at present should be put aside. Being able to enjoy a bit of happiness is considered an unexpected stroke of luck. As for hoping for wealth and honor, hoping to cling to the old ways, it is neither appropriate nor allowed by reality. If one vaguely longs for some good dreams of the past, or lingers and cherishes the beautiful scenery of the present, it is a small-minded, selfish, and clever act; it is simply forgetting one's roots and being foolish. Therefore, no one should mistakenly believe that the current difficulties and hardships of life are abnormal, but must recognize that hardship and difficulty are the duty of living in this great era. Recognizing this duty will allow us to understand that material things are not worth valuing, so why dwell on the high or low price of goods, the rise or fall of the legal tender? We do not deny that holding material things and legal tender is a valuable capital for life, but in this great era, whether to cope with reality or to create a future, "people" are the most worthy of attention, the most valuable capital for life. Not only that, but they are also the most reliable capital for life. The heat, intelligence, and physical strength of people have a value that commodity prices cannot compare with, a value that legal tender cannot measure, and a value that foreign exchange cannot affect. Whether to cope with reality or to create a future, we must rely on human power. Whether to enjoy happiness or have a bright future, we must treat human strength as the key ingredient. Buying American dollars and hoarding goods cannot be fully managed, but to the greatest extent possible we can retain and make use of our heat, intelligence, and physical strength, then there is absolutely no risk of failure. Not only that, but one can almost achieve whatever one seeks. If we cannot get what we are looking for, then we must regret that our own heat, intelligence, and physical strength are a little inadequate. To exchange legal tender for American dollars is a loss and painful. If we make use of our heat, intelligence, and physical strength to engage in production, and make good use of this period that favors exports, then we can exchange it for American dollars that we will get more of and can be delighted with. So on and so forth, not just seeking to be delighted. Try to think about prices, try to think about the legal tender, gloomy, distraught, and in a state of unease, is that not fundamentally forgetting that you are an able-bodied "person"? To evaluate the value of people with legal tender is a person who is nothing more than legal tender, and loses the essence of being a person. In this case, it is necessary to use human power to increase the value of the legal tender, only then will you be a person who uses legal tender, or perhaps one who can keep legal tender. Hoping that the legal tender increases in value to improve the value of people is putting the cart before the horse. You should quickly encourage yourself to preserve, increase, and make use of your heat, intelligence, and physical strength. If you have plenty of human power, you will see a rapid surge in production, this is the fundamental plan.

### On the May Fourth Memorial Day, Chen Cheng Publishes "A Letter to Revolutionary Youth," Urging Them to Recognize the Mission of the Times and Complete the Great Cause of Resistance and Reconstruction

Chongqing. On the "May Fourth" Memorial Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China, Chen Cheng issued a "Letter to Revolutionary Youth," which stated, "The 'May Fourth' Movement has reached its 21st anniversary. Recalling the youth of that time, the patriotic movement promoted a revolution in the entire society's thought and culture, creating a modern Chinese national consciousness of self-reliance and a revolutionary movement striving for liberation. This glorious fact will forever encourage us revolutionary youth to fight to the death with the enemy and strive for the bright future of the entire nation and country. However, social changes and historical progress have made the environment in which we youth find ourselves today completely different from the 'May Fourth' era, and the responsibility that Chinese youth bear for the revolution today is also completely different. Today, we are in an era of resistance and reconstruction. Under the leadership of the great leader Chiang Kai-shek, the people of the entire country are carrying out the war of resistance against Japan, which has laid the foundation for final victory. At the same time, the great cause of revolutionary reconstruction is also progressing step by step. Therefore, the path of struggle for us youth today should be completely different from the past, and the responsibility we bear is also increased simultaneously with the progress of the revolution. Today, on our 'May Fourth' Memorial Day, I would like to sincerely share with my beloved young comrades the mission of the current era and the responsibility of revolutionary youth.

First, we must recognize that the mission of the current era is to seek the completion of the Second National Revolution. To accomplish this historical task, first of all, the youth of the entire country must deeply understand that national unity and national independence are the most basic preconditions for all problems in modern China. Only by achieving unity and independence can we maintain the glorious history of the Chinese nation for five thousand years and create a prosperous and happy new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the youth of the entire country must unify their will, concentrate their strength, and absolutely take the interests of the entire nation and country as the premise, and with full awareness and confidence, love our country and nation, and love our brilliant history, to train ourselves and become upright Chinese people.

Second, we must recognize the revolutionary responsibilities of the present and the future. The main revolutionary responsibility of youth lies in the future, not the present, because the revolutionary responsibility of the present is already being shouldered by our elders. The greatest expectation of the country for the youth is to ask the youth to carry on the past and open up the future, continue the legacy of the revolutionary martyrs, and strive for the long-term and arduous cause of national reconstruction. Therefore, the leader instructed us, "The future destiny of China rests on the youth." We must bear the revolutionary responsibilities of the future and live up to the expectations of the country and the leader. Only by burying ourselves in preparation now, striving to enrich our knowledge of national reconstruction and cultivate a strong physique, and paying special attention to the cultivation of production skills, the research of national defense science, and the study of our own history, geography, and culture, can we youth become the necessary talents for national reconstruction and the backbone of national rejuvenation. In addition, what is particularly important for us youth is to cultivate the spirit of loyalty to the party and love for the country, and cultivate a noble and pure personality. Among young comrades, we must love each other like brothers and sisters, share each other's joys and sorrows, unite sincerely, help each other, and have the spirit of promoting love for others, in order to create a moral model for the new youth of China.

Third, we must correctly resolve the suffering of youth themselves. In terms of thought, only believing in the Three Principles of the People is the most correct and revolutionary path. Our country has been able to overcome all difficulties amidst internal and external troubles and defeat the Japanese entirely because it relies on the Kuomintang, which has a great and wise leader. The President of our party has awakened all party comrades and the people of the country to resist foreign aggression and revive the nation. In the past three years, the number of party comrades who have sacrificed in the hail of bullets has reached a total of 110,000. This great and heroic sacrifice is the greatest contribution of the Kuomintang to the nation and the country. Only under the leadership of the Kuomintang, which is the most progressive and the most capable of struggle and sacrifice, can we young comrades seek a way out for the nation and the country, and thus seek a way out for everyone. Secondly, the suffering of youth in life and career will definitely be thoroughly resolved in the victorious process of resisting aggression and building the country, because the difficulties and unemployment that we have experienced in the past and present are due to the various political oppressions and economic aggression of imperialist Japanese warlords against us, as well as the exploitation and destruction caused by domestic warlords, bureaucrats, and reactionary elements. In the future, with the victory of the war of resistance and the success of national reconstruction, all the factors of oppression and exploitation will have been fundamentally eliminated, and we youth can live a free, happy, and happy life. Especially in the process of national reconstruction, the country needs millions of construction talents, and we youth can do our best, contribute to the country, and assume the responsibilities of the backbone of national reconstruction.

Fourth, we youth should have a spirit of self-awareness and increase our own cultivation. This cultivation is to awaken the youth to strive forward, encourage self-reliance and self-improvement, overcome the adverse environment, and eliminate resentment towards society. We know that youth's dissatisfaction with politics and social annoyance are inevitable, but we should seek it within ourselves and from now on resolve to reform politics and reform society, because the future society belongs to us, and those corrupt elements will eventually be destroyed by the wheels of time. What we need to do is to cheer ourselves up and strive to become strong, so that in the future we can create a perfect society from our own selves. If we do not pay attention to this point and simply complain about heaven and blame others, we will inevitably repeat the mistakes of our predecessors. Looking at what happened to the youth who beat Cao Rulin in the "May Fourth" era, this is the experience and evidence before our eyes, which we must take as a warning and do our best. In this way, the future world can be better than the previous generation. Finally, we must understand that the characteristics of the current youth movement are constructive, unified, and active, not destructive or passive. In the past, the youth movement often only had human relationships but no organizational leadership, relying only on emotional impulses and not on rational analysis. Therefore, youth became the tools of speculators, private individuals, or factional struggles, and became useless victims. The reason why the "May Fourth" Movement could not last for a long time was precisely because of the lack of organization and training. Now, since the establishment of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League, the youth movement has had a clear goal. In the future, the youth of the entire country, under unified organization and training, will each become a youth of the country. Therefore, we must pool our efforts and work together to engage in social service and production construction, and bury ourselves in enriching our knowledge of national reconstruction, using a unified, constructive, and active youth movement to promote social evolution and promote the great cause of revolutionary reconstruction. In short, we youth are in a great era of resistance and reconstruction today. We must understand the historical mission of the era and our own revolutionary responsibilities to work hard to find a way out for the nation and the country. In other words, we must contribute our personal equality and freedom to seek the equality and freedom of the nation and the country. When President Sun Yat-sen went north and bid farewell to the Huangpu students for the last time, he instructed us, "If you want the revolution to succeed, you must first sacrifice your personal freedom and personal equality, and contribute your freedom and equality to the revolutionary party. Only the party has freedom, and individuals cannot be free, so that our revolution can hope to succeed." This testamentary instruction is the most sincere instruction of the President for the youth to revolutionize and save the country. We hope that every young comrade who aspires to revolution will follow this great testamentary instruction and have full preparation from now on, with strong organization and training, to seek a way out for the nation and the country. This way out is definitely not the way out for a few people, but a broad road for 450 million people, the broad road of the revolution of the Three Principles of the People. Young comrades, we are the vanguard of the revolution, we must bravely march forward on the road to the new China of the Three Principles of the People!" (Third Dispatch)

### The Kidnapping of Four German Nationals in Peiping

Peiping. Four German nationals were kidnapped by bandits at Biyun Temple in the Western Hills on a recent holiday. They were later rescued by the Peiping Municipal Police. According to the kidnapped individuals, although four of them were kidnapped at the same time, two of them, namely, Mr. Walser, a staff member of the German Embassy in China, and a woman, were released after being kidnapped for several hours. The bandit leader ordered them to negotiate, demanding a certain amount of sorghum rice, several luminous watches, and 50,000 yuan in cash as the price for redeeming the other person. However, they also hinted that if 50,000 yuan could not be raised, a few hundred yuan would suffice. Another German national who stayed in the bandit's lair, Mr. Herschlup, an employee of Lihe Foreign Firm, presented a luminous watch and a small amount of cash that he had with him to the bandit leader. The bandit leader initially rejected it, claiming it was an individual's private funds. Later, probably because the luminous watch was dazzling, he finally accepted it and was willing to deduct the price of the watch from the ransom. However, before Walser and others could deliver the ransom, the Peiping Municipal Police surrounded the bandit's lair. The bandits retaliated with Mauser pistols and so on, and then fled. The two German hostages were thus rescued. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 2nd)

### Allied Forces Defeated and Abandon Positions in Southern Norway - Namsos Under Frenzied Bombardment by German Aircraft - Reports of Allied Retreat Confirmed

London. An army bulletin stated that the Allied forces, which had been conducting a holding action south of Trondheim in recent days, had repelled numerous enemy attacks. However, due to the enemy's ever-increasing military strength, they have retreated and boarded ships in Andalsnes and nearby shores. Although the enemy air force tried to destroy these ports and their communications, the Allied embarkation was not interrupted. The war in the Narvik area is continuing. Allied troops have made contact with the enemy. Nothing to report from Namsos. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)

Berlin. The German High Command announced yesterday that the German army had reached Andalsnes in pursuit of the defeated British army and hoisted the German flag there at 3 p.m. (Dispatch from Haitong on the 3rd)

London. Military sources here recently stated that when British troops withdrew from the port of Andalsnes, some loss of military equipment was unavoidable. As for the German claim of having captured "innumerable spoils," it is unfounded. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 3rd)

Stockholm, Sweden. According to the latest news, Namsos port was again heavily bombed by German planes yesterday, causing many civilian casualties. In the Roros area, German troops have been trying to strengthen their positions yesterday. According to reports from correspondents of various newspapers here, a bridge leading to Roros, which was originally destroyed by Norwegian troops, is now being quickly repaired by the German army in preparation for an offensive. Therefore, the city is likely to be occupied by the German army again. However, the number of German troops currently fighting there is small, only a few hundred infantrymen, armed with rifles and machine guns, and several small armored vehicles for support. In addition, Norwegian troops resisted strongly south of Oslo and retreated after blowing up the bridge over the Glomma River. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 3rd)

Stockholm, Sweden. Yesterday, German planes bombed Namsos eleven times in twelve hours, turning almost all the buildings there into rubble. Incendiary bombs and bombs also fell near Grug, and explosions were heard throughout the day. A British destroyer in Namsos Bay was hit by two bombs and sank immediately. Twelve British sailors were killed and many were injured. (Dispatch from Haitong on the 3rd)

Stockholm, Sweden. According to today's news, British and French troops have completely withdrawn from Namsos, and German troops are said to be advancing there. This news has now been confirmed by a phone report from Foldalsfoss. However, the details of the withdrawal are not yet known. According to Norwegian observers, there are no traces of Allied forces in Namsos, and it is heard that German troops are advancing there rapidly. However, news from the Norwegian border says that it is still unknown whether the Allied forces intend to withdraw completely from Norway or to withdraw from the northern Norwegian ports. (Dispatch from United Press on the 3rd)

London. Berlin official radio said that this afternoon the Allied forces withdrew from Namsos, and said that many warships gathered in the port to cover the withdrawal of troops. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)

### King of Norway Not Leaving the Country - General Headquarters Relocates - Continues to Direct Operations

London. Well-informed sources here stated that Allied troops are continuing to approach Narvik, but little news has been received in the past two days. According to responsible individuals, the British withdrawal from Andalsnes does not mean abandonment of Norway. The Norwegian government still exists, and the Norwegian King is still in the country. It is now believed that the Norwegian Commander-in-Chief in the Andalsnes area has moved his headquarters elsewhere and is still directing operations from there. Qualified individuals here believe that the technical and military aspects of the withdrawal from Andalsnes have proven a great fact, namely, that since the beginning of the war, this is the first time that British troops have truly encountered fierce fighting. They have fully demonstrated their combat bravery and completed the most difficult military operation, as they were responsible for the rearguard task against an absolutely superior air force. The fact that the Germans did not dare to interfere with the British re-embarkation fully proves that the British must have inflicted extremely heavy blows on them. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)

Stockholm, Sweden. When British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech yesterday, he said that the Norwegian war should not be underestimated, but it has not yet reached the settlement stage. Norwegian officials here strongly agree and are convinced that the Norwegian military and civilians are determined to resist until the aggressors are driven out of the country.

### British House of Commons to Begin Debate on the War Situation Next Tuesday - Prime Minister to Continue to Make Detailed Statements - Current Government Facing a Serious Test

London. A Reuters reporter in the House of Commons has learned that the situation in Parliament at the end of the week is unlikely to change significantly. All members are awaiting Prime Minister Chamberlain's further statements on Tuesday before beginning the debate on the war situation. Opinions on the latest war situation in Norway are now pouring in from around the world, with some supporting one view and others supporting another. Therefore, it can be said that the public will be increasingly concerned about the debate next week. After listening to the government's general statement on Tuesday, members may ask the government not to propose a Whitsun recess. However, the course of Parliament must be decided after the entire Norwegian war situation is revealed. At next week's meeting, the policies adopted by the government before and after the German invasion of southern Norway will be closely questioned. However, even critics now acknowledge that since the Norwegian government strictly adhered to neutrality before the German invasion, the Allied powers had to respect that neutrality. This was the main obstacle to the rapid arrival of the expeditionary force in Norway. Most opinions seem to be satisfied with the fact that the expeditionary force, which was previously assembled and prepared to go to Finland, has been disbanded due to the rapid change in the Norwegian situation. However, whether this is really the case is likely to be the main question for the government to answer on Tuesday. Members are now discussing various strategic points. Whether this discussion will be limited to army and navy matters, and whether the government's war policies will be attacked, will depend on the government's response on Tuesday. Most cabinet members still believe that they can provide powerful answers to all questions. Others are not so satisfied and are prepared to attack at any time. The opposition party has not yet expressed any opinion and will not take any action to increase the overall situation until the government has clarified everything. The House of Commons debate is expected to last about two days, and the House of Lords will discuss the overall situation on Wednesday. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)

### Berlin Boasts of Victory in Norway

Berlin. The official review of the war situation in Norway, published here yesterday, declared, "Since the German army began occupying Norway on the morning of April 9, all important Norwegian ports and air force bases have fallen into German hands by nightfall. However, land communications have not been opened up, because the ports are hundreds of kilometers apart and are separated by towering mountains and few usable roads. Although the British High Command understood this situation, the British army has lost the initiative because of the German army's preemptive strike. After the British navy landed in Namsos north of Trondheim and Andalsnes south of Trondheim, British Prime Minister Chamberlain confirmed in the House of Commons on May 2 that the British planned to completely isolate Trondheim and then use a large military force to overcome this important town in central Norway. This counterattack plan by the British against the German landing has been shattered by the German army. At the beginning of last week, the German army in Trondheim began to advance north and occupied Steinkjer, 100 kilometers north of Trondheim. The British army retreated, and the road south of Namsos was blocked by the German army. At the same time, the German air force heavily bombed Namsos, destroying transport ships, docks, barracks, and food warehouses. As a result, the British army has been greatly alarmed by the shortage of food in recent days. Secondly, the British army wanted to land from the south and occupy Trondheim. This attempt was destroyed by the German army's rapid occupation of Stavanger port through Skagerrak. In order to block the German advance, the British army suddenly sent troops to Lillehammer. However, on Monday and Tuesday of this week (i.e., April 29 and 30), the German army severely damaged the British and Norwegian armies and turned the railway hub of Dombas and Storlen into ashes. As a result, the British army was unable to transport troops from Andalsnes to Lillehammer or Trondheim. At the same time, because the air force bases have completely fallen into German hands, the British army is unable to advance to Trondheim from Andalsnes. When the German army advancing from the Oster River valley connects with the troops advancing south of Trondheim, the British army in Andalsnes has only two options: one is to retreat into the sea, and the other is to be completely annihilated. According to Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, the British army should take the first route, that is, withdraw from Andalsnes, leaving the German army to occupy central Norway alone." (Dispatch from Haitong on the 3rd)

### German Air Force Attacks British Ships

Berlin. A communiqué issued by the German High Command stated that the German army had occupied Andalsnes. Yesterday, when German planes attacked the British fleet off the west coast of Norway, a British aircraft carrier was hit by a bomb, and a British destroyer was also hit. Two British fighter planes protecting the British ships were shot down, and one German plane did not return to base. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)

### Italian Newspapers Mock Britain

Rome. The Italian official news agency's foreign dispatch stated that the Allied withdrawal from Trondheim was "the second Gallipoli." London had said that Germany had made a major strategic mistake and had "missed the bus." However, the Allies in Norway not only missed the late bus, but also lost their luggage.

### Britain and France Mobilize Naval and Land Forces to Strengthen Defenses in the Near East - Fleets of Both Countries Gather in the Eastern Mediterranean - No Less Than a Strong Warning to Italy

Cairo. The combined British and French fleets, including many warships of all sizes, have arrived in Alexandria, Egypt. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 3rd)

Jerusalem. A batch of troops from British Southern Rhodesia arrived in Palestine yesterday. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)

Paris. An unofficial report yesterday said that when Fuehrer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini met in the Brenner Pass, they mentioned three key points on how Italy should act if it decided to join Germany in the war, and these were studied. Therefore, the possibility of the European war extending to the Mediterranean is more certain. It is understood that Hitler has pointed out that Italy should launch naval and air force attacks in order to divide the Mediterranean into two sections between Sicily and the Italian military base of Pantelleria Island and the narrowest part of Tripoli, and cut off the supply lines between the Allied forces in the Near East and their home countries. At the same time, it will cut off British trade with Mediterranean countries. According to reports from France, Italy has concentrated its main force of 111 submarines and a large fleet of torpedo boats in the strait between Sicily and French Tunisia. There is considerable confidence here that the British and French navies can control most of the Mediterranean, because their naval forces there amount to more than 750,000 tons, while Italy only has 495,000 tons. (Dispatch from United Press on the 3rd)

Rome. British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday was commented on by political figures here, who said that Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement that the British and French fleets had sailed to Alexandria, Egypt, to further normalize naval power in the Mediterranean, was a statement aimed at Italy, declaring that although the British and French were fighting in the North Sea, the strength of their respective Mediterranean fleets had not been weakened. However, Italy is not moved by this threat. In addition, the exchange of views between U.S. Ambassador Phillips and Prime Minister Mussolini the other day is of great international significance, and the general public here has been deeply impressed.

Situation in the Near East and the Balkans

### Italy Assures the United States that it will Maintain the Status Quo in the Mediterranean

Washington. The Italian Ambassador to the United States, Collona, had a 15-minute conversation with Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday afternoon, and then called on President Roosevelt. This conversation has aroused great interest. Welles later told people that the State Department had received a detailed report from the U.S. Ambassador to Italy, Phillips, on his meeting with Mussolini on Tuesday, which was of a general nature and exchanged views on the international situation. In view of the above conversation, the State Department seems to believe that Italy does not have the intention of joining the war immediately. Welles declined to comment on Italy's attitude towards the belligerent countries, but he told reporters that the State Department had not considered the issue of warning Americans to leave Italy. It is generally believed that this remark indirectly confirms the news from Rome that Mussolini told the U.S. Ambassador that Italy did not intend to participate in the war. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)

Washington. According to diplomatic sources, Ambassador Collona provided assurances to President Roosevelt on behalf of Prime Minister Mussolini, declaring that Italy's non-belligerent status had not changed. U.S. Ambassador to Italy Phillips had stated to Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday that the recent situation in the Mediterranean was uneasy and that the U.S. government hoped that it could be eased, otherwise it might have to prohibit American ships from sailing into the Mediterranean. British merchant ships have been ordered to stop passing through the Mediterranean. If the United States follows suit, Italy's source of goods will be scarce, and its economic institutions will inevitably be greatly affected. For this reason, Italy has made the above assurances to the U.S. government. In the view of U.S. political figures, although the situation in the Mediterranean has eased slightly, the U.S. government is still paying great attention to it. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 2nd)

Washington. The Yugoslav Minister to the United States, Fotić, held talks with U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday. Semi-official sources said that Welles told Minister Fotić that the Italian authorities had explained their intentions towards Yugoslavia and provided assurances, declaring that there was no intention to change the status quo in the Mediterranean.

### Greece Determined to Defend its Territory with All its Strength - Ten Classes of Reserve Officers Conscripted and Trained in Batches

Athens, Greece. Yesterday was May Day, and Prime Minister General Metaxas delivered a speech in which he said, "Our country's air is already filled with unease and anxiety, because the current European war is perhaps the most terrible in history. Its significance is not only about whether a certain country will expand or lose territory, but also about the civilization of the centuries to come. One thing is reassuring in our country, that is, our country in this European war is completely different from the previous European war. In the past, the country failed to unite, but now it has sufficient strength and is united in spirit. If our country's independence is threatened, we will definitely defend it." (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 2nd)

Athens, Greece. Ten classes of reserve officers have been called up for one month of training. They will be enlisted in four batches. The first batch must report on May 15. All junior officers of the highest rank are on the list of those called up. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)

Athens. The "Estia" newspaper reported that the Greek government's recent conscription of ten classes of reserve officers is not related to the international situation, but is merely a routine call-up for training in accordance with precedent. (Dispatch from Havas News Agency on the 3rd)

### Imminent Crisis: Egypt Intensifies Preparations, Air Defense Drill Advanced, Necessary Measures Taken to Maintain Security

Cairo: The news that the Allied fleet and auxiliary ships have set sail for Alexandria has been received with great satisfaction throughout Egypt. It is widely believed that this indicates the Allies' closest attention to Egypt's defenses. Yesterday, British Commissioner Lampson, Egyptian Prime Minister Maher, and the heads of the British and Egyptian armies held a meeting, believing that all necessary defensive preparations have been taken and that Egypt is prepared for any eventuality. The anti-aircraft artillery exercise, originally scheduled for May 5th, involving nighttime firing by coastal artillery units and blackout measures, has been advanced to May 7th to avoid interfering with university examinations. A new espionage law stipulating the death penalty for those found guilty of conspiracy and espionage is currently under serious discussion in the Senate. (Reuters, 3rd)

Cairo: Prime Minister Maher held an important meeting this morning with Defense Minister Harb, British Ambassador Lampson, British garrison commander General Wilson, and a senior Egyptian government official. After the meeting, Defense Minister Harb stated that the discussion focused on various measures to maintain security. In addition, Prime Minister Maher met with officials from the Ministry of Interior to discuss methods of monitoring foreign residents and decided to station an Egyptian army unit within Cairo. Afterwards, he issued a statement saying, "All measures to maintain security have been arranged. Although the current situation is fraught with crisis, it is not imminent. There is no need for excessive panic." The Prime Minister also received Italian Minister Maglione, who subsequently stated that he had not received any instructions from his government indicating an imminent crisis and therefore remained optimistic.

### British Lord Privy Seal: Theories Published, British Troops Concentrated in the Near East Are Solely for Defensive Measures

London: British Lord Privy Seal Wood stated in a speech yesterday that restoring Norway's freedom is essential to world peace. "We will not rest until Norway is free." Wood also stated that Britain does not threaten the peace of the Mediterranean. Regarding the concentration of British troops in the Near East and Middle East, Wood said that these troops do not seek to threaten any country in Egypt or Palestine but are prepared to undertake any duties that may be required. These troops will be engaged in defending Britain's allies, such as Egypt and Turkey. (Associated Press, 3rd)

### Countries of Southeastern Europe Interdependent, Aspire to Maintain Peace, British Ambassador to Turkey Suddenly Visits Sofia, Yugoslavia Declares No Request for Aid to Romania

Bucharest: Foreign Minister Gafencu recently told reporters that the peace of the "Danube" region and the Balkan Peninsula is closely linked to the peace of the Mediterranean. If turmoil occurs in one place, it inevitably affects others. Therefore, the countries of Southeastern Europe are interdependent. Having learned from the pain of past bloodshed, they all seek to maintain order and freedom. (Havas, 2nd)

### Reactions to Chamberlain's Remarks

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain, in his statement to the House of Commons on the state of the Norwegian war, concluded, "I would like to take this opportunity to warn the House and the nation that we do not want Norway to become merely a prologue, nor do we want to be tempted to disperse our forces to the point where our overall strategic position is weakened to a dangerous degree. We know that the enemy has a centralized position, possesses a prepared force ready to strike, and that its attack can be launched with lightning speed in one of many theaters. We also know that the enemy is prepared to invade Holland and Belgium without hesitation, and even to invade the innocent neighboring countries of Southeastern Europe. What they are prepared for may go even further, perhaps a large-scale attack on the Western Front, or a blitzkrieg against Britain. What folly it would be if we were to reveal to the enemy the strategy we plan to defeat them. But we can say that we will not disperse or immobilize our forces to the point where it hinders our freedom of action when an emergency arises. We must seize every opportunity in Norway to inflict heavy blows on the enemy, but we must also not forget the overall strategic advantage that will ultimately prevail. I must reiterate that what I have said is only a temporary, not a final, statement. Certain military operations are in progress, and we cannot disclose anything at this time that would endanger the lives of those engaged in them." (Reuters, 2nd)

Strengthening Resolve to Fight

Paris: Opinions here on Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks are mixed. Many say that only the leader of a great power would have the courage to make such a statement, and the Prime Minister's forthrightness is widely praised. The news of the retreat only strengthens the confidence to fight with all our strength. The French know that what Britain and France are most committed to is cutting off Germany's access to Narvik and weakening the German fleet. Now this has been completely successful. As for the war in central and southern Norway, it is considered secondary by Britain and France. The Norwegian war is not over, but it is only one act in a long war, and the final result is undoubtedly certain. (Reuters, 3rd)

Assessment of British and French Prestige

New York: The "New York Times" details the Allied retreat from Åndalsnes, saying that the abandonment of southern Norway is a blow to Allied prestige and a serious strategic setback. The people of Britain and France must not be overcome by adversity or lose their courage and determination under fire. They can now rely on this to fully strengthen their organization and train themselves in preparation for the greater task ahead. The "New York Herald Tribune" states that it will not be easy for the German army to keep its loot and will have to expend a lot of energy to do so. This energy, used elsewhere, may be more advantageous. (Reuters, 3rd)

Impact on the London Market

London: Yesterday's report by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons on the situation in Norway caused the British stock exchange to stagnate today. The Prime Minister's speech also affected the price of British government bonds.

Italian 7% bonds, which were originally priced at 90 pounds this year, have now fallen to 48 pounds. The prices of Greek and Bulgarian bonds have also fallen sharply. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Sweden Feels Bitter

Stockholm: This morning, several newspapers here expressed disappointment and regret over the Allied retreat in Norway. "Nychterhets-Tidningen" stated that if Trondheim cannot be captured from the south, it will be even more difficult to capture it from the north. "Svenska Dagbladet" also said that although the British Navy has had victories at Narvik and recently in the Kattegat and Skagerrak, using submarines to attack German troop transports, it still cannot stop the constant transportation of German troops.

### American Chamber of Commerce Requests Government Protection of American Interests in China, U.S. Congress Studies Shanghai Financial Issues

Washington: The American Chamber of Commerce yesterday resolved to request the U.S. government to continue to oppose Japanese discrimination against American interests in Japanese-occupied areas of China. This proposal was requested by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and endorsed by chambers of commerce throughout the United States. Washington received the request from the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai a few days ago and immediately listed it as one of the motions to be discussed at the meeting of representatives of the General Chamber of Commerce this week. This proposal is unrelated to the report from the American Report Committee in Shanghai this week to Secretary of State Hull requesting a loan to stabilize China's currency. Officials yesterday did not involve any other criticisms of new loans to China. Congress is currently studying reports of the sharp decline in Shanghai's Chinese national currency exchange rate yesterday. In addition, officials yesterday remained silent on whether the Chongqing government has formally submitted a request for a loan to stabilize the national currency to the U.S. government.

The mission includes Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton, Mr. and Mrs. Hankett, Mr. and Mrs. Paradis and their two daughters, Ms. Claire, and Ms. Louise. The mission is tentatively scheduled to leave Japan on June 3. (Reuters, 2nd)

### British Financial News Assesses China's Exchange Market: Speculative Activities Expand, Legal Tender Suffers Adversely

London: Circles here related to the Far East take the attitude that the recent sharp fall in the price of China's legal tender is an inevitable move. Financial news confidently states that speculative activities unfavorable to legal tender have greatly expanded in recent times, so maintaining the exchange rate of four pence and one-eighth has resulted in a rapid outflow of funds remaining in China's equalization fund. Londoners now believe that the recent weakening of the "free pound" price has encouraged speculative activities unfavorable to the Chinese exchange rate, because the Chinese exchange rate has actually been linked to the pound price in recent years. London bankers say that the issuance of Chinese banknotes will continue to undermine efforts to control and maintain the exchange rate, but the main difficulty is that the value of imports exceeds exports. The price of legal tender fluctuates with China's general foreign trade, and the question of what level its price will reach is now a matter of speculation. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Bucharest Times Comments on the Far East Situation

London: According to a special report here, the Bucharest Times comments on the Pacific problem, saying that in the current environment, it is difficult to find a policy that satisfies Japan's needs. The Netherlands has expressed clear evidence of sympathy for Japan and is encouraging the European trend of adjusting raw material distribution. However, Japan does not want to wait for the European-initiated principle of adjusting Asia. The trend of Japanese Asian imperialism has controlled Tokyo's public opinion. (Reuters, 3rd)

### German-Hungarian Business Negotiations Come to an End

Budapest: Economic circles here recently stated that the talks between Dr. Clodius, Director of the German Foreign Economic Department, and the Hungarian authorities have come to an end. The goals were two-fold: first, to increase the quantity of various Hungarian specialties transported to Germany, according to the general production adjustment plan for the countries of Southeastern Europe; and second, to find ways to transport various fuels produced in Hungary, especially kerosene, to Germany. However, the results of the talks do not seem to have produced any concrete decisions. It has recently been reported that Dr. Clodius intends to return here for another visit, at which time he will certainly make every effort to find a solution. (Havas, 2nd)

### U.S. Naval Expansion Plan Re-submitted for Review, Secretary of War Advocates Strengthening National Defense

New York: The New York Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao recently reported that the Senate Naval Affairs Committee has decided to invite various military experts to attend and present their views again regarding the $655 million naval expansion plan. The reason is that since the recent outbreak of the war in Northern Europe, the effectiveness of the German Air Force has proven to be greater than that of the British Navy. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Edison recently stated that the air defense equipment of U.S. warships must be strengthened, and this is the reason. In view of this, the members of the Naval Affairs Committee decided to re-submit the naval expansion plan that had recently been reviewed and passed for discussion. (Havas, 3rd)

Washington: Secretary of War Woodring recently stated in a speech that in the past four weeks, people all over the world have witnessed the invasion of Denmark and Norway. What value, then, is there in the non-aggression treaty that Denmark signed with Germany seven months ago? This is indeed doubtful. As far as the United States is concerned, we must maintain an effective and efficient army, and we must maintain adequate national defense so as to absolutely prevent any attempt at aggression. In a word, we must maintain sufficient military strength to ensure that our words are respected by others. We will never allow those who change or divide the map to expand their activities to the Western Hemisphere. (Havas, 3rd)

Washington: According to congressional sources, at a closed-door meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday, Air Force Commander Major General Arnold gave a speech saying that the United States, based on the lessons learned from the current European war, has made major reforms to the structure of fighter planes. The most important of these are two points: one is to equip them with larger-caliber cannons, and the other is to install bulletproof fuel tanks. Senator Roger then spoke, saying that at a time when the aircraft industry is changing rapidly, the U.S.'s existing military aircraft may no longer meet the needs of war. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)

Korean bills were evenly supplied and demanded, and the evening market was still 9 jiao, 8 points, 7 points.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Rise, Ending a Week of Change, Public Debt Also Sees a Small Rise

The securities market suddenly saw a rebound yesterday. It is said that this is a general speculative element. At first, they sold public debt and bought gold. Now, they sell gold and buy public debt. They made a lot of profit during a reversal. Therefore, the bond market has set off an unexpected wave. However, the silver root is too tight, and doing gold requires an interest rate of more than 4.5%, so they mostly sell and buy back public debt. The transaction is nothing more than replenishing empty positions. There are very few new long positions. In yesterday's transaction, buyers were dominant in the morning, and sellers were dominant in the afternoon. Lianhe and Lianyi No. 20 and No. 38 had to replenish empty positions sooner or later, and retail investors were mostly still eating in. Hongda, Xieda, Tongshun, Jiufeng, Yitai, Hongkang, etc. mostly flowed out of bank spot, and most of them were cut by long positions. The market price was high and low, but it was still 4 jiao to 8 jiao. More than 800,000 yuan was traded. A simple table is listed below:

In stock trading, 200 shares of Hanyeping were traded at a price of 3 yuan and 7 jiao. Due to the shrinking of foreign exchange rates, stock markets ended a week of many changes under a tidal buying frenzy. This short cycle of trading has left many people with cash in hand at a loss, and even speculators who often think of making big profits with small investments share the same feeling. The instinct of many stock prices is to rise again, but at the close, there was a slight reversal due to the closure of floating positions. I don't know what the exchange market will be like when the new trading in the future month of Monday enters the market. If it is still unchanged in its current state, or even deteriorates further, then the rising wind seen yesterday will only be a prelude to a big rise. As for which industrial stock or rubber stock can get the biggest boost, it is difficult to predict. Before commenting on the general market situation, the following two short messages may be welcome to those who care. Shanghai Enterprise Company is about to increase its capital and add new shares (every two old shares can get three new shares, the issue price of new shares is 5 yuan and 5 jiao). The stock has risen to 7 and a half yuan yesterday, and the issuance matters are generally managed by Jardine Matheson & Co. China Real Estate Company will pay a special dividend of 2 yuan. The stock rose to 20 yuan, 75 to buy yesterday, and it seemed very cheap. Shanghai Yeguang, China Reclamation, and British Union stocks were traded the most. Jardine Matheson's rising momentum was very sharp, and yesterday's closing was up 10 yuan compared to the previous closing. Steel stocks also rose to 51 yuan. Kaiping stocks rose from 73 yuan to 76 yuan. Jardine Matheson's stock was traded well, rising to 76 yuan (excluding interest). Xiangtai Lumber Company's stock caused a general scramble due to its announced excellent dividend, and it was difficult to buy a large number of stocks by pulling back to 73 yuan. The rubber stock situation was strong. Few sold shares were almost completely seized after the opening. Few people are willing to transfer these phenomena under the current price, and this phenomenon is especially seen in various superior stocks.

The 38th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Xiangtai Lumber Co., Ltd. is scheduled to be held on May 24th. After the meeting, a special shareholders' meeting will continue to be held. The last dividend for the year from March 1, 1939 to the end of February 1940 is planned to continue to distribute 4 yuan per share of national currency, and the mid-term dividend will be 6 yuan and 5 jiao in national currency.

### Cotton Yarn: Lack of Purchasing Power, Significant Decrease in Consumption

The previously surging yarn and cloth market saw some calm yesterday. However, speculators remained enthusiastic, frequently entering and exiting the market, keeping busy. Actual transactions, however, were virtually at a standstill because, after the price surge, there was a lack of purchasing power, and consumption significantly decreased. The peak price for May futures reached 1,755 yuan, then fell back to 1,700 yuan. Currently, the yarn market is still fluctuating slightly. Given the large range of price fluctuations, the future is extremely risky.

This morning, the yarn market opened with continued upward momentum from the previous day. Brokers were particularly aggressive in pushing prices higher. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,720 yuan, a further increase of 60 yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rates stabilized and actual sales were sluggish, prices quickly fell to 1,640 yuan, a significant difference of 80 yuan between the high and low. Following this, short positions were covered, and prices rebounded slightly. It is reported that 1,425 bales were traded in half a day. The price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is now up 10 yuan. Furthermore, 22 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today (the 4th), and 10 pieces were shipped to Tu Le. The amount purchased by each group is listed as follows:

Fellow Traders 1,115 Hong Kong 285

Inland 10 Ningbo 15

Total 1,425

### Cotton Prices Reach Extreme Heights, Mills Forced to Halt Operations

The transaction of raw cotton is extremely scarce. Factories are completely inactive in terms of procurement, with only fellow traders engaging in mutual buying and selling. This is because prices have already reached an extreme height. The current transaction situation of raw cotton is listed below:

Fire Cotton Bale 228.00 Fellow Traders bought 990 bales

Omra 276.50 Also 200 pieces

General Packing 255.00 Also 253 pieces

White Lo Qu 285.00 Also 100 pieces

Mitterling 310.00 316.00 Also 300 pieces

Additional News: Foreign Cotton Market: The New York cotton market was particularly quiet yesterday. Subsequently, due to declining news from Liverpool and some Southern hedging sales, market conditions weakened, and the closing price was lower than the previous day, with near-term contracts down 45 points and long-term contracts down over 10 points. The Indian cotton market saw a sharp drop in the Shanghai exchange rate, leading to a significant reduction in Far East transactions, with an expected drop of six rupees. Egyptian cotton rose over 30 points.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is exceptionally quiet. The Indian cotton shipped earlier was mostly priced in rupees. Because of the recent extreme tightness in credit, there are not many bills of exchange being settled. Therefore, this sharp contraction in exchange rates has caused considerable harm. Those in the trade who hold spot goods cannot find buyers at high prices due to the extreme tightness in credit, but they are unwilling to sell at low prices. Therefore, the current situation is unusually chaotic, with prices but no market. It is difficult to predict what the future will hold. (The market conditions published yesterday were for May 1st; this is attached as a clarification.)

### Piece Goods: Fabric Speculators Swarm In

The cotton cloth market opened steadily this morning. As the prices had risen sharply, actual sales were even more sluggish. The exchange rate stabilized slightly, and there were many who were willing to sell at a discount to the market price to settle their positions, so the market trend turned loose. The market price was lower than the previous day's closing price. However, after noon, upon hearing that the exchange rate had tightened again, people were stimulated, and they changed from selling to buying. The asking price for each white fabric has stabilized slightly, increasing by about five jiao per piece. There were also many who made small additions to the original price. The prices for non-fading fabrics, where the dyes were all of European origin, rose wildly by five to six yuan per piece. The majority of transactions throughout the day were accounted for by fellow traders in this street and outside speculators. In total, there were approximately a thousand futures contracts. Customer sales have not yet improved, but retail sales in the stores in this street have increased sharply because most ticket prices have not yet been raised.

This morning, Dragon Head fine cloth, a type of white cloth from the East, opened at 53.25 yuan per piece for spot goods available at the warehouse. Later, many fellow traders sold off their long positions, and the closing price at noon fell to 52.2 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, because the foreign exchange rate contracted again, speculators from outside the industry swarmed in, and the market atmosphere tightened instantly. The price once rose to 55 yuan for spot goods and 57.25 yuan for futures contracts at the closing. People's confidence remained strong, with the current spot price being 54.9 yuan and the current month's futures contract at 57 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge is currently being offered at 1.585 yuan per yard, with the current month at 1.65 yuan.

### A Chorus of Price Increases: The Plight of Living Becomes Even Harder

Since the soaring of gold and foreign exchange, rice merchants have taken the opportunity to hoard, offering high prices one after another. Those who usually purchase foreign rice forward are now treating what they have in hand as rare commodities, raising the price by one yuan at once. Floating speculators and small retailers are also stirring up waves, chasing each other. As a result, the market price of Saigon No. 1 reached a peak of 52 yuan. Other types, such as No. 2 Saigon, were quoted at 50 yuan, Fire-hulled at 50 yuan, and Small-hulled at 49 yuan, with price differences of as much as three to four yuan. People could not help but be wary of this. The highest actual selling price for No. 2 Saigon was 49.5 yuan, Fire-hulled 49.5 yuan, and Small-hulled 48.5 yuan. Those who profited took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the price fell back by half a yuan to one yuan. If the closing price was quiet, it was about 2.5 yuan higher than the previous market. During this surge in foreign rice prices, domestic japonica and glutinous rice prices were also affected and presented an upward trend. Glutinous rice increased by 2 yuan. Kai Li Special Grade was 44 yuan, 43.5 yuan. Common Dan goods in the central market were 42.5 to 40 yuan. It is rumored that there were many secret transactions of japonica rice outside the market, also rising by about 2.5 yuan. Kai Wuxi Special Qing Semi-finished product was 50 yuan. Chang Kun White Japonica was 48-49 yuan. Qing Si Special Thin was 49 yuan. Big Market was 48.5 yuan, 48 yuan. South Port Early Rice Special was 48 yuan, Next was 16.5 yuan.

Yesterday, foreign rice prices soared. Prices were raised by two to three yuan in the morning and another two to three yuan in the afternoon, an increase of four to five yuan in a single day. The original package of No. 1 Saigon was quoted from 60 yuan to 61.6 yuan. No. 1 Saigon gradually rose from an opening price of 57.2 yuan to 59.5 yuan in the afternoon. May Saigon rose from 58.5 yuan to 61 yuan. The original package of Siam No. 2 Saigon was priced at 57.5 yuan to 98.5 yuan. Small-hulled spot rice was the most active, opening at 47.8 yuan to 48.3 yuan at the close of the morning market, then rising to 50.05 yuan in the afternoon. The evening market was slightly calmer, down by two or three jiao. The intensity of the price surge was rare and was actually caused by general speculation. Therefore, the total transaction volume of spot rice was 16,000 to 17,000 bags, with actual sales accounting for less than three-tenths. There were also over 700 tons of original packaged rice available on the market.

The oil and bean market opened with instability this morning due to the urgent release of hoarded supplies by floating speculators. The market trend at the close of the morning session showed mixed gains and losses. Unexpectedly, the situation changed suddenly in the afternoon. Due to the rampant price increases across the board, people were shocked, and market prices surged again. As a result, the oil market rose by another one or two yuan, and bean prices continued to rise by 1.3 to 1.4 jiao. Detailed market information is listed in the market price column.

Yesterday, factory prices for flour also increased by three jiao, changed to 13.8 yuan in cash. It is expected that prices will continue to increase by two to three jiao today or Monday. As flour is subject to Japanese and puppet government interference, and there are rumors of controls on the new wheat harvest, old-brand flour from returned shipments is being quoted at prices comparable to factory prices. As a result, prices opened at 13.73 to 13.77 yuan. Other inland flours also require 13.3 to 13.4 yuan. The total volume of transactions is estimated to be over 10,000 bags. Merchants from the Northern Gang showed some interest. The price for Cannon Brand customer shipments also rose from 14.6 yuan to 15 yuan. However, wheat trading remains stagnant, and market prices are being maintained.

The sugar market has not eased since the sharp contraction of foreign exchange. The guild set prices gradually in the morning. The spot price for 24 coarse white sugar at the warehouse was 74 yuan to 73.5 yuan. The initial price for foreign new goods was 73 yuan, then rose to 73.5 yuan, and then remained at 73 yuan. Old goods were 72.5 yuan. The transaction volume was estimated at 1,500 to 1,600 bags. Re-exported goods were 47 yuan for 57 yuan, 484.5 yuan for Taikoo Car White B Mark, 460 yuan for H Mark Car Red, 464 yuan for Dutch Red, and 53 yuan for Re-exported. The price for this factory's Snow White was 474 yuan. As a result, coarse white sugar actually rose by 10 yuan. In the afternoon, upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate had tightened again, sellers raised their prices by several yuan. Until the black market foreign exchange rate eases, there seems to be no sign of prices falling back down. Domestic sugar is also tracking the upward trend. Dongxiang Red was 130 pieces, 53 yuan; Tiao Qing was several dozen baskets, 47 yuan; Diao Qing was 50 bags, 60 yuan, all increasing by about 7 yuan. Gong Ge Red was over a hundred pieces, reaching as high as 61 yuan. It is reported that 2,100 bags of sugar were shipped to Tianjin today.

The coal market immediately suspended trading after the exchange market changed drastically the day before yesterday. Formal trading only resumed yesterday. The price of both anthracite and white coal increased by 30 to 40 yuan. The quoted price for Indian Kalkata anthracite was 300 yuan per ton, Borneo anthracite was 295 yuan per ton, Hongji white coal was 205 yuan, Haifeng white coal was 212 yuan, and Little Zi was 210 yuan. The above prices are for transactions among fellow traders. Retailers add an additional ten or so yuan when selling to customers.

The hardware market has increased by another 20% compared to before, and in some cases even 30%. For example, 200-pound Company Iron is sold for 190 yuan per box, 90-pound Double-Linked Tinplate is quoted at 220 yuan per box, 100-pound Double-Linked Tinplate is 270 yuan, New Iron Wire (No. 16 to No. 20) reached 120 yuan, and Black Iron Billets actually reached over 1,200 yuan. Such chaotic prices are truly rare.

Tea sales to Europe are still difficult to develop because of the lack of space on African mail ships. As for exports, 4,000 pieces were shipped to Tianjin today.

### Promoting the Spirit of the May Fourth Movement, Youth Circles Unite and Strive, Today's Enthusiastic Celebration of Youth Day, Municipal Party Headquarters and Three Youth Groups Issue Declarations, Encouraging Youth to Complete the Great Undertaking of Resistance and Nation-Building

Today is the anniversary of the May Fourth Movement and has been designated by the Central Government as Youth Day. Youth across the country will hold enthusiastic celebrations today. Although the youth of this city are in a special environment and will not hold celebratory ceremonies, in view of the fact that youth are the pillars of the nation and the vanguard of the people, and that their responsibilities are most important during this time of national crisis, they are determined to strengthen their integrity, invigorate their spirits, strengthen their physique, cultivate their studies, and contribute all their strength to the country and nation in order to win the final victory in the war of resistance. Thus, the revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth Movement will be further promoted and carried forward.

Municipal Standing Committee Announcement to the Youth Circles

The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang addresses the youth of Shanghai, stating, "The May Fourth Movement is a victorious memorial festival for the Chinese youth movement. We recall the upright and brilliant denunciation of the traitors by the youth and students at that time, opposing the Twenty-One Demands of Japanese imperialism, striving to refuse to sign the Treaty of Versailles, boycotting Japanese goods, and other fighting spirits, fully expressing their sincere and enthusiastic love for the country and nation. We should understand that the May Fourth Movement in the eighth year of the Republic of China was inspired by the Kuomintang's National Revolution and was able to achieve unprecedented results. We should also understand that the great power of knowledge and youth that can concentrate and firmly believe in the Three Principles of the People is to combat the aggressive policies of Japanese imperialism and all reactionary evil forces. At a time when the Japanese army is rampant in China and puppets are taking the stage, the knowledge and youth must make redoubled efforts to carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, concentrate their will and strength, unite under the leadership of the Kuomintang and the Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek, appreciate the central government's established policy of resisting and building the nation, and destroy the evil forces of the Japanese puppets. Our slogans are: (1) Carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, (2) Complete the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation, (3) Destroy the evil forces of the Japanese puppets, (4) Support the National Government, (5) Long live the Three Principles of the People.

The Three Youth Groups Clarify the Significance of the Memorial

The Three Principles of the People Youth League, in commemoration of the "May Fourth", issued a message to the youth, stating that the "May Fourth" movement was an important turning point in the modern history of the Chinese nation. It not only stirred up a surging tide of anger in the ideological and cultural circles, causing epoch-making progress in the ideology and culture of the time, but also alerted and intimidated the political institutions, politicians, and bureaucrats who were not yet clear at the time. They knew that this new ideology and new power had freed them from the shackles of the Manchus.

The Chinese Nation

can no longer be manipulated in disguise by a small number of people. Let us once again uncover the historical traces after "May Fourth" and examine the several tragic incidents caused by our nation's being subjected to violence and humiliation. Which one was not caused by the intellectual youth and students rising up to resist, leading the masses, and resolutely fighting against the oppressors. These

Blood Deeds

for the heroic sacrifice of fighting for the survival of the nation, are deeply imprinted in our minds. All citizens of the Republic of China should unanimously respect and love these youths who uphold the spirit of the "May Fourth" and are enthusiastic about patriotism. Here, we must also solemnly inform the invaders that they should not ignore the "May Fourth" spirit latent in the blood of every Chinese youth. Self-satisfied invaders often

indulge in anger, and are stubbornly tyrannical and oppress at will. They only know that China is weak, but they do not know that the post-revolutionary China, although not perfect in appearance, is far from comparable to the old China in terms of national consciousness and the determination and enthusiasm of the youth. This is because they have not understood the impact of the "May Fourth" student movement on the general intellectual circles and youth groups in China. Before the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the investigation reports of the staff headquarters and the army of the invaders all said

The National Government

cannot unify China, the soldiers have no national concept, and the revolutionary army cannot completely unify China. Who knew that from the fifteenth to the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Republic of China was unified by the revolutionary army of the Three Principles of the People. This was a miscalculation by the invaders. In this war, they thought that they could realize their dream of conquering the entire China by using rapid warfare. This dream was shattered again, and then

Political Offensives

diplomatic offensives, but these offensives have made China's resistance increasingly strong, and the enthusiasm of the people has become more intense. This is another miscalculation by the invaders, and the origin of these errors is because they do not understand that Chinese youth have been baptized by new ideas since the "May Fourth" and have a strong will and boiling blood. The Chinese intellectuals are by no means pedantic and weak. This kind of invaders'

miscalculation, because of national estrangement, has produced such a result. The vast majority of Chinese and youth are conscious and outstanding members. In the strong resistance, the youth have been tempered to be brave and firm. From now on, the youth should carry forward the spirit of the "May Fourth", enhance the awareness of resistance, and give the traitors and false people a merciless blow. This is the practice of national revolution, the completion of historical tasks, and the only purpose of commemorating the "May Fourth" student movement. Shanghai Branch of the Three Youth Groups.

Youth Practice the Movement of Integrity and Shame

More than 70 units of students from major middle schools in this city have automatically responded to the movement of integrity and shame and organized practice groups. In order to seek unified action, the Shanghai Youth Circle Integrity and Shame Movement Committee has been organized. On the occasion of the "May Fourth" commemoration, a message to the students was issued, and a large number of leaflets were printed and distributed to inform the practice groups to mobilize publicity on this day. The original text is briefly recorded as follows: Today we commemorate the "May Fourth". In addition to adhering to the post and striving for sufficient knowledge and ability, we also raise the following points and encourage our youth circles to work together: (1) Carry forward the inherent morality and firmly establish a spiritual fortress. Since the "May Fourth" movement, the new culture has flourished, and China has also roared. However, the general scholars are obsessed with Europeanization and abandoned the inherent essence of China, so there has been no progress in politics for more than 20 years, and foreign aggression has become more and more serious. In fact, we should accept the new culture as much as possible, and at the same time, we should advocate and carry forward the good old morality. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the foundation of our Chinese culture for thousands of years. Today, evil people are rampant because of the loss of integrity and shame. Therefore, our youth must take propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as the guide for thought and action, eliminate worries, strengthen our will, and strengthen the defense against temptation and threats with the determination of "white blade can be trampled, and official position can be resigned", so that ghosts and monsters will disappear from our surroundings. (2) Recognize the goal and determine the direction of progress. We must avoid falling in the current great era. First of all, we must distinguish between good and bad and identify right and wrong to determine our own direction of progress. Our youth students in the city have made considerable progress in this work in the past, but from now on, we should recognize the goal and calmly deal with the invasion of conspiracies. (3) Work hard and endure hardship, and practice the movement of thrift. Youth students are in an isolated island, and the environment is such that it is an unfortunate thing, but it is also a rare and glorious opportunity. Because the environment gives us suffering, it also gives us a good place to temper our body and mind and sharpen our will. We must wash away the old habits and practice hard, and cultivate the habits of neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, and frugality in our daily life, eliminate the bad habits of messiness, filth, complexity, and luxury, and practice the extreme thrift and hard work to save the decline of the social economy. In the violent storm, it is stirring on the isolated island. Perverted oppression and cruel destruction are coming one after another. We must maintain justice and resist and struggle under the siege of various corrupt forces to complete the sacred historical mission.

### Yesterday, the Rumors in the City Market Gradually Subsided, the Legal Foreign Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged, the Current Restriction is to Prevent Japanese Puppets from Profiteering, and the Equalization Committee Should Continue to Maintain the Foreign Exchange Market

After the Chinese government decided to maintain the stability of the monetary system and foreign exchange, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee and the HSBC Bank, in cooperation with British merchants, secretly tried to maintain the black market of foreign exchange in Shanghai. Therefore, although the black market of foreign exchange in Shanghai was manipulated by Japanese puppets and speculators, the foreign exchange market was still able to stand on the new level. Now, because HSBC Bank has restricted the supply, the prices of British and American foreign exchange have shrunk sharply, the market is chaotic, and people are uneasy. It is heard that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has decided to handle the matter according to its past principles. In addition to making every effort to stabilize the legal foreign exchange, it is still the principle to try to maintain the black market of foreign exchange. Various rumors are not credible.

Black Market Foreign Exchange is Appropriately Restricted

The rumors in the foreign exchange and other markets gradually subsided yesterday, and people's hearts were slightly at ease. The HSBC Bank's listing has stabilized and is the same as the previous day, but the actual market has shrunk slightly. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited the responsible personnel of XX two major banks. According to the discussion, the sharp shrinkage of the foreign exchange black market is due to the suspension of supply from Hong Kong. As for the fund of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, the total amount is 10 million pounds, and it is still very sufficient. In order to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange black market in the dark market and to prevent the conspiracy of Japanese puppets and the manipulation of speculators, it is necessary to give it considerable restrictions, not to completely stop the supply. How the restriction method is, ordinary people cannot know. It is also heard that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee will never announce the restriction method.

The Legal Price Will Never Change

Regarding the legal foreign exchange, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has decided to maintain it with all its strength, so the legal foreign exchange is still stable and will not change due to the contraction of the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai. The legal foreign exchange rate listed by the Central Bank yesterday morning was one shilling, two pence, and half for British foreign exchange, and thirty yuan for American foreign exchange. For imported goods operated by importers, which are not prohibited from being imported and are necessary for domestic use, they can apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase legal foreign exchange. At the same time, after the actual settlement of the foreign exchange amount for the export of local goods, they can receive the difference between the legal price and the bank's listing price from the settlement bank with the settlement documents. This proves that the legal foreign exchange has not changed. The government's policy of maintaining the legal foreign exchange has always been the same. The drastic change in the foreign exchange black market has nothing to do with the legal foreign exchange.

The Equalization Fund is Very Sufficient

Regarding the Equalization Fund Committee's equalization fund, the total amount is 10 million pounds. Since its establishment, the amount spent on maintaining foreign exchange and the remaining fund are kept secret by the authorities because it concerns the black market exchange rate. Yesterday, according to a foreign bank inquired by a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, foreigners guessed that there was still more than one-third of the committee's fund, about 4 million pounds, and there was a saying that the equalization fund would be increased by 5 million pounds, so the power to maintain the legal foreign exchange and the black market foreign exchange is more than enough. Moreover, the financial authorities have long stated their determination to maintain the exchange rate, but the decline in the black market foreign exchange is conducive to the export of Chinese local goods and can prevent the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods from the customs of the occupied areas.

Timely Adjustment is Inevitable

According to the authority of Yu Rongjie, the current contraction of the exchange rate occurred after the establishment of the preparatory committee of the new "Central Bank". It is obvious that it is a step to deal with the pseudo-bank. Because the pseudo-bank has no preparation, it is inevitable to take the hand of the Japanese bank to obtain foreign exchange to fill the preparation. The Japanese bank uses the legal currency it spends on buying foreign exchange as a loan from the Japanese bank to the "New Central Bank". Nearly 8 million US dollars were sold in the last few days of last month. If the government continues to supply indefinitely, it will inevitably be exploited, which is very clear. Moreover, the import surplus in the first quarter of this year was 17 million pounds, which is almost double the 9.9 million pounds in the same period last year, so it must be adjusted.

The Japanese Side Will Suffer a Fatal Blow

The impact of the foreign exchange contraction is that prices have risen, and people's lives are difficult, but the Japanese side has suffered a greater blow. Because its proposed financial plan has been shattered, if it continues to implement foreign exchange arbitrage, it will not be able to overwhelm the legal currency in its occupied area, and it will add a "currency parasitized on the legal currency, which only makes the currency tend to expand and the finance falls into chaos. If it wants to establish a sound currency by itself, it does not have this financial power. It is difficult to advance or retreat. Therefore, the Japanese yen, fresh currency, and "United Bank Notes" circulating in China all rise and fall with the legal currency. The currency itself has no independent value.

### Taking the Opportunity to Raise Prices, Determined to Strictly Prohibit, The Two Concession Authorities Issue Orders, Will Take the Most Severe Sanctions

The black market exchange rate fell again yesterday, and the price of US dollars rose again. The Public Concession and the French Concession authorities were deeply afraid that speculators would profit from it and make the market more chaotic, so they decided to take appropriate measures to curb the activities of speculators and issued the following notice:

The Municipal Council Notice

The Public Concession Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday, saying that if merchants selling various necessities unreasonably raise the selling prices of the items by using the changes in the exchange rate of the Chinese national currency, the Bureau will prohibit it.

The French Authorities Warn

The French Concession Price Equalization Committee warned that in order to warn, the French Concession authorities will take the most severe sanctions against those who take advantage of the opportunity of changes in the value of Chinese legal currency to illegally raise prices. The French Police Department has been ordered to strictly enforce Article 11 of Order No. 78 of the French Consul General's Office on February 19, 1940. All merchants and people should abide by it. This notice, May 3, 1940.

Prices Soar, Stores are Crowded

It is found that the prices in this city rose sharply yesterday. The price of rice, whether Saigon rice or domestic rice, has been sold for about 50 yuan. All department stores are unprecedentedly crowded with customers. It is generally feared that prices will rise further in the future, and daily necessities must be prepared slightly. But in fact, the market price of all daily necessities has risen since yesterday.

The Rice Market is Dangerous and Attempts to Manipulate

Rice market speculators took advantage of the changes in the exchange market to try to manipulate the price of rice. However, the actual sales appetite is weak, and the market is all speculative trading. Therefore, the price of rice rose and fell three times within two hours after the opening of the rice market yesterday. The market situation was unstable and dangerous. The rice industry groups had previously decided to stop short selling and buying transactions in the market. Now, in the tense situation, they once again warned their colleagues to abide by the market rules and not to have any excessive behavior. In order to prevent non-industry players from using idle funds to participate in speculation and disrupt the rice market, they specifically notified their colleagues that goods transactions should be sold by customers to firms, and firms should sell to stores, and should not violate this regulation.

Coal Balls Actually Increased in Price Again

The market price of coal balls sold by the coal ball factory was decided to be increased by the industry association's joint meeting of manufacturers on the 21st of last month, which once attracted the attention of social figures and the criticism of the media, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to stop it, urging them to be careful not to follow the trend and take the overall situation into consideration. However, the industry claimed that the cost was huge and it was difficult to maintain, and they defended the external criticism. However, coal balls are indeed daily necessities that cannot be lacked by the citizens of Shanghai, and the poor and the ordinary people are severely affected. Now, the industry has openly decided to increase the market price again yesterday, citing the sharp contraction of foreign exchange and the increase in cost as reasons. The factory's wholesale price has increased by 23 yuan per ton, and the retail price has been changed to 8 yuan and 5 jiao per dan, which has been implemented since yesterday. According to reliable sources, the bottom of the coal dust is not scarce, and the source is also very smooth. Therefore, the 4 million citizens of the city are eagerly waiting for the authorities to quickly investigate and deal with it, ban illegal transactions, and immediately order the relevant fuel groups to issue strict market trading rules so that speculators cannot show their skills.

Abnormal Prosperity is Coming to an End

The population of Shanghai after the war has become a concentration of refugees from all sides, claiming to be more than 4 million. The exact number is not known due to the lack of formal statistics. It is undoubtedly true that the demand for houses in the two special districts is greater than the supply, and the population has indeed increased compared with before the war. The consumption prosperity of the concession after the war is due to the support of this large population. According to observers, the prices in Shanghai have been rising steadily for the past two years, always in a straight line. The price of rice, coal, and daily necessities have all risen again and again. To this day, most people, especially the wage-earning class, can no longer make a living, and families with many mouths are even more painful. "It is not easy to live in Shanghai", almost everyone has this feeling. According to estimates, under the threat of high prices in Shanghai, the population will soon decrease significantly, and the commercial market will also tend to be depressed. At that time, empty houses will line the streets, just like the phenomenon in the past depression period, and the hoarders who are currently following the trend, as well as unscrupulous merchants, will also be overturned.

### The Municipal Council Vetoed the Issuance of Municipal Charitable Lottery Tickets, Believing that it is Not a Good Policy to Benefit the Public, The Bureau is Determined to Prohibit Gambling

Regarding the proposal to issue municipal charitable lottery tickets by the Municipal Council, the Board of Directors has discussed it from the ethical, legal, and economic points of view. As a result, it is believed that no matter whether it is of a charitable nature, it is not a good policy to benefit the public and should not be implemented. The biggest reason is the principle problem, because the Bureau is determined to prohibit public gambling. The Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers of this year was also thoroughly explained by the Chairman of the Board, Fan Kelin. This time, the resolution of the majority of directors believed that the prohibition of gambling should be maintained for the sake of public interest.

Legal Arguments

The issuance of municipal lottery tickets has the nature of public gambling. In addition to not being able to implement it in principle and ethically, the Bureau also has major doubts about the legal point. If the Bureau is prepared to issue it, the directors will definitely ask for certificates to ensure that they have not violated the laws of their respective countries. Regarding the matter of certificates, the Bureau's lawyers and legal advisors referred to the legal codes of China, Britain, and the United States, and found that

British Law

stipulates that the issuance of lottery tickets is an improper act. Any British employee of the Bureau who participates in it, or any British director who is the head or initiator of this matter, will be prosecuted. According to

American Law

any American residing in China who operates a gambling house or issues lottery tickets is a criminal act. Furthermore, according to

Article 269 of the Chinese Criminal Law

the issuance of lottery tickets is illegal unless it has been approved by the government in advance. Officials and directors of the respective nationalities who participate in such improper measures will not only be prosecuted publicly, but also be sued privately. In fact, the Bureau has received a letter from a taxpayer, saying that it will use all appropriate legal steps to prevent the issuance of municipal lottery tickets.

The Nature of Lottery Tickets

As for the two types of lottery tickets that the concession has approved for sale, they have also been investigated. This type of lottery ticket has a legitimate and special nature. One is operated by the state and approved by the Chinese government, and the other is approved by the Bureau, for the reason of meeting the needs of the public.

Study of Interests

Some directors believe that the issuance of municipal lottery tickets by the Bureau will damage the financial position and credibility of the concession. As for how much actual benefit can be obtained from the issuance of lottery tickets, it is also questionable. Or it is said that no matter how much revenue is, the Bureau can increase funding for social relief undertakings such as hospitals, shelters, etc., because the current revenue is only enough to meet the necessary expenses. Or it is said that if the Bureau wants to raise funds for relief, there is more than one way, such as levying entertainment tax, etc., and the real needs of the concession's relief work can rely on social figures to provide a continuous supply. The past relief work for refugees is a clear proof, so the Bureau cannot use the reason that the financial resources are limited and it is difficult to cope with the expenditure of social work as a reason for issuing municipal lottery tickets.

### Careless Departure, Negligence Caused Trouble

Destroyed Three Towed Barges, Japanese Fishing Boat also Injured

The Norwegian merchant ship Taisman, managed by Tienshang Foreign Firm, loaded with more than 5,000 tons of cargo from the United States on the 19th of last month. Because the European war expanded and Norway was attacked by German troops, the ship was forced by British warships to return to Hong Kong near the Dachiquyang sea off Shanghai. The Norwegian ship was allowed to return to Shanghai. The ship returned from Hong Kong on the 27th and berthed at the Gonghexia

### Shanghai Municipal Council: Banquet in Honor of Mr. Fessenden, Praising Mr. Fessenden's Achievements During Three Years in Office, Maintaining the Neutrality of the Concession Amid Hardships

The Shanghai Municipal Council held a banquet at the Shanghai Club on the evening of the 2nd of this month to entertain the retiring Chairman, Mr. Fessenden. In addition to Mr. Fessenden, those present included the new Chairman, Mr. Cornell, as well as the new and old councilors and senior officials of the Council.

New Chairman Praises the Achievements of the Old Chairman

During the banquet, the new Chairman, Mr. Cornell, rose to speak, saying in brief: "Since the former Chairman, Mr. Fessenden, assumed his heavy responsibilities three years ago, it cannot be denied that they were extremely onerous. Although he has left office, he has not left Shanghai. In the future, he should continue to use his rich experience to assist the Council at any time. When he first took office as Chairman in the spring of 1937, the Shanghai War broke out not long afterward. As a result, the threat to this port was unprecedented. Fortunately, under Mr. Fessenden's guidance, we were able to pass through it safely. After the war, refugees gathered from all directions, and the population increased three to four times compared to before the war. All municipal facilities were affected by this, and the rise in prices, the lack of resources, and the adverse effects caused by the war were unavoidable. Under such circumstances, maintaining the internationality and neutrality of the concession was extremely difficult, but the fact that we were able to get through it safely must be attributed to Mr. Fessenden's effective leadership and dedication to work. There is more than one thing worth remembering about his achievements during his term as Chairman. The most important thing is that he took the lead in resolving the issue of the roads outside the boundary in the western district of Shanghai. He shouldered a heavy responsibility for this negotiation. During the negotiations, his vision was far-reaching and his perseverance was admirable. The draft agreement has now been signed, and detailed methods are still under discussion. It is hoped that a satisfactory solution can be reached soon, paving the way for the peaceful resolution of other issues in the concession in the future. Both publicly and privately, we should express our deep gratitude and praise for Mr. Fessenden's efforts."

Mr. Fessenden Delivers a Speech of Thanks

Mr. Fessenden then rose to give a speech of thanks, saying in brief: "I am honored to be present at this grand occasion tonight. I am very grateful for Mr. Cornell's praise, which is too much for me. As Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, I have only done my duty. The affairs I have handled on weekdays have never exceeded those handled by other councilors, and the success of all matters depends on the collective efforts and cooperation of all colleagues. I regard Shanghai as my second home. All my property and friends are in Shanghai. If Shanghai suffers any adverse effects, I will also suffer adverse effects. Therefore, when I was in office, I always aimed to improve Shanghai. In these eventful times, the concession has been able to maintain its neutrality thanks to the cooperation of all parties. The future of the concession is promising. This year, the board of directors of the Municipal Council has appointed a person with various qualifications as Chairman, which is deeply gratifying. It can be predicted that he will become one of the most successful chairmen in history, and there are many serious issues in the concession that rely on this wise and experienced new chairman to resolve. Among the guests are those who will serve as members of the Economic Committee of the Municipal Council. I sincerely hope that you can submit a concrete report, and also pay attention to how to avoid the council's educational policies, maintain prison funding, tax unregistered land, and make routine foreign currency payments. Finally, I would like to express my deep gratitude for the friendship and cooperation of my colleagues, and for the kindness of being invited to this grand occasion tonight."

### Kunming-Hong Kong Direct Air Route

Air France Plans to Open the Route Soon

(Special interview by this newspaper) According to information from transportation circles, a direct air route from Kunming to Hong Kong is being planned by Air France and will soon be officially opened. Currently, transportation between Yunnan and Hong Kong relies on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Haiphong, where passengers transfer to ships. There are also mail planes flying between Kunming and Hanoi, and between Hanoi and Hong Kong. The former is the Yunnan-Hanoi route of China National Aviation Corporation, and the latter is a section of Air France's route and Imperial Airways' Hong Kong-Bangkok route. The schedules of these routes are not connected. If the aforementioned direct air route is realized, transportation between Yunnan and Hong Kong will be more convenient.

### Norwegian Merchant Ships in Shanghai Operating as Usual

London Management Committee Approved by the King of Norway

News has emerged from the Norwegian Legation in Shanghai that Norwegian merchant ships in Shanghai have been ordered to operate as usual.

According to personnel at the Legation, Norwegian shipping companies in London have formed a management committee to handle dispatching responsibilities. It is also reported that the establishment of this committee has been approved by the King of Norway. It is further reported that Norwegian shipping in the Far East will be protected by the navies of Britain and France.

### Japanese Youth Yamamura Arrested by Japanese Military Police, Accused of Defaming Japanese Military Leaders, to Be Tried by Military Tribunal

The English-language "China Press" reported that a Japanese man named Yamamura, 31, a former student at Tokyo Imperial University, residing in Shanghai at 17 Haineng Road, was arrested by the Japanese military police on charges of treason and will be tried by a military tribunal. Yamamura is accused of aiding the enemy, leaking military secrets, and fraudulently establishing a cultural education association, obtaining 40,000 Japanese yen. In February, Yamamura printed and distributed a leaflet titled "Declaration of Japan" in China and Japan, severely defaming Japanese politicians and military leaders. In February 1938, Yamamura arrived in Shanghai. In April of the following year, he organized the South Asia Association, claiming that its purpose was to cultivate cultural education activities and investigate the situation in South China. He fraudulently used the names of senior officers of the Japanese Army and members of the House of Peers as chairmen of the association, and fraudulently obtained 40,000 Japanese yen from wealthy Japanese residents in Shanghai to carry out his own plans. Yamamura had previously violated the newspaper law and committed bribery crimes four times.

### Driver Dies Bizarrely in Front of "Yi Lu" in Western Shanghai, No Scars on Body, But a Bloodstain on Back of Clothes

At around 2 a.m. yesterday morning, a bizarre bloody incident was discovered in front of the "Yi Lu" gambling den at 368 Haig Road in Western Shanghai. The deceased had a large, bright red bloodstain on his clothes, but after examination, there were no wounds on his body. According to a detailed investigation by a Pingming News Agency reporter:

Suddenly Died by the Car

At 2:51 a.m. yesterday morning, Xiang Sheng Automobile Company suddenly received a phone call from the Yi Lu gambling den, stating that a driver had died by a car in front of the company. The company immediately sent someone to investigate and found that the deceased was the driver of the company's car with license plate number 18477. He was immediately sent to the Red Cross, but he had already died. The Red Cross reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The police station was unable to investigate because the incident occurred in a "bad land" alley.

Legal Tender Beside Elbow

The driver's body was lying on the ground in front of Yi Lu. There was a small plate-sized stain of bright red blood between his upper back and waist. There was a one-yuan legal tender note next to his elbow, and a paper slip with a signed fare and 35 legal tender currency units in his upper pocket. The Xiang Sheng Company stated that, according to the driver's custom, the fares were always placed in the upper shirt pocket. The deceased's fares were placed in the lower pocket, which must have been placed by someone else after his death. Furthermore, when a car arrives at Yi Lu, the porter of the gambling den would usually deliver the fare to the car. The driver does not need to get out of the car. Now that the driver is dead on the ground, it is possible that he was murdered.

General Speculation

The deceased's name was Ding Qingxiang, 43 years old. He was usually honest and didn't fight with anyone. Since this case was neither revenge nor a robbery, and although there were no wounds on his body, it can be speculated from the bloodstain that a major accident must have occurred in his car that the deceased knew about, so he was murdered to silence him.

### Manager of Tiancheng Qianzhuang Kidnapped Yesterday

At 1:20 p.m. yesterday, a kidnapping occurred near Baker Road and Chengdu Road in the Public Concession. It was later learned that the kidnapped person was Qiu Ruyu, the manager of Tiancheng Qianzhuang at 26 Zhifu Road in Shanghai. Qiu's family lived at 11 Fanyan Lane, Baker Road. At the time, several kidnappers broke into the residence, intimidated with weapons, and dragged Qiu out, putting him into car number 18037 parked on the corner, and sped away. His whereabouts are unknown. Afterwards, the Qiu family reported the information to the police. It was reported that the car was found by the police an hour later and is currently under investigation. It was also reported that the owner of the Qianzhuang was Lu Gengsheng, who was killed in an assassination last month.

### Pirates Who Robbed the Wuling Wheel Sentenced: Six Years of Imprisonment

The Taikoo Company's Wuling steamer was sailing to Sanhe Port in Qidong County, North Jiangsu Province, on December 1st last year at 3 a.m. to load floral fabrics for Shanghai. Suddenly, 50-60 pirates drove small boats from the port to chase the Wuling Wheel, attempting to rob the fabrics. They carried new weapons. The Russian guard on the Wuling Wheel fired to defend, killing the pirate Zhu Fufu and wounding the pirate Chen Zhengxue (18 years old, from Yawo Sha). The remaining pirates fled the ship and returned to the port on their original boat. The Wuling Wheel brought the two pirates to Shanghai and reported it to the Water Police Station, which then reported it to the French Concession Police Station. Chen was sent to the hospital for treatment, and the corpse of Zhu was sent to the morgue. The Second Special District Court sent personnel to investigate, and after Chen recovered from his injuries, the French Concession Police Station brought him to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation on charges of piracy. Due to jurisdictional issues, the Second Special District Court submitted a request to the Supreme Court to designate the court to accept the trial. Now that the interrogation has been completed, Judge Zhang Minsheng of the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court ruled that Chen Zhengxue was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for piracy, five years for attempted murder, and five years for deprivation of civil rights, to be served concurrently for a total of six years. He will be held in custody pending the appeal period.

### Bloodshed on Route Tenant de la Tour: Fan Yongming Shot Dead, Bullet Wound to Neck Proves Fatal, Shooter Escapes Scene

Fan Yongming, a 24-year-old from Wenzhou, wearing a coffee-colored suit and yellow leather shoes, was riding in a rickshaw pulled by Liu Yongfu, a man from Jiangbei, on Route Tenant de la Tour near the Zhumaocang (Pig Hair Factory) at 11:30 a.m. yesterday when a gunman suddenly fired a shot at him, hitting the upper part of Fan's neck. The bullet penetrated, and Fan bled profusely and was on the verge of death. The rickshaw puller was also knocked to the ground and suffered minor facial abrasions. The shooter had already fled the scene. The patrol police arrived after hearing the gunfire and quickly summoned an ambulance, which took Fan and the rickshaw puller to Tongren Second Hospital for treatment. Fan died soon after due to the severity of his injuries. The rickshaw puller, Liu Yongfu, was taken away for questioning after being bandaged by the doctor. It is reported that Fan was an employee of the so-called Shipping Association. Fan was on his way to a friend's house on Singapore Road for lunch when he was unexpectedly attacked.

### Soochow Rice Relief Campaign Coming to a Close

The rice relief campaign initiated by Zhang Shuliang, Yan Dao, Wu Zhizhong, and others from Soochow University has been going on for more than a month. Thanks to the voluntary promotional slides and advertisements from major cinemas such as the Great Light and Nanjing, and the broadcasts of fundraising programs by radio stations such as Xindu, all sectors of society have responded and schools have imitated the campaign to help the starving people whose livelihoods are about to be cut off. Therefore, the campaign will be ended early. A meeting was held yesterday afternoon to resolve that the campaign will end on the 5th (Sunday). The money raised will be entrusted to charitable organizations to sell white rice at a reasonable price. With the end approaching, please submit donations to the Landa Hall as soon as possible to facilitate an early end.

### Kidnapping of Huang Qiwu Case

The Zhabei Police Station previously captured three bandits, including Wang Xiangxian, who kidnapped Huang Qiwu and demanded a ransom. It has been verified that this case was not handled by Chief Inspector You A'gen of the Chinese Police. The previous report that it was solved by Inspector You was not factual. This is to correct the record.

### Postman Arrested for Delivering Opium

He was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division for prosecution yesterday morning. After interrogation by Judge Qian Hong, he was ordered to be detained for sentencing.

### Armed Robber Breaks into Home Late at Night and Chops Japanese Couple

Doi Keikichi, a 49-year-old Japanese businessman, runs the Isuzu Western-style goods store at 190 Tiantong Road, specializing in civil engineering and construction. He has been making a lot of profit in recent years. Keikichi, his wife, and his son, Kenjiro (23 years old), usually live on the second floor of the store. At 3:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, when it was late and quiet, several men broke into the second floor and chopped the sleeping Keikichi and his wife with axes, injuring their heads, faces, chests, and arms. Blood flowed all over the bed, and they fell unconscious. The perpetrators, seeing that their goal had been achieved, stole 233 yuan in cash from the silver box and fled. Kenjiro discovered the incident, and upon going into his parents' room, saw that his father had died from his injuries, and his mother was barely breathing. He hurriedly reported the incident to the Japanese authorities, who sent the injured person to Fumin Hospital for treatment. It has been reported that a suspect in the case was arrested yesterday.

### Shooting on Rue Cardinal Mercier Last Night: Pimp Shoots Prostitute; Wang Sanyuan Shot in Chest; Motive Suspected to Be Jealousy

At around 6 p.m. yesterday evening, a violent shooting occurred at 8 Qunyu Lane, 161 Rue Cardinal Mercier in the Public Concession. The victim was Wang Sanyuan, a prostitute, who was shot and seriously injured. The details, as reported by our reporter Liang, are as follows:

Prostitute Yiyuan Thriving Business

Among them was a prostitute named Wang Sanyuan, 17 years old, with dark skin and stunning beauty. She usually solicited customers at the rooftop garden of the Great World, commonly known as "running the company." Because of her youth and beauty, her business was booming. At around 6 p.m. last night, Wang Sanyuan, dressed in her pajamas, was putting on makeup, preparing to go out to receive guests, when suddenly three thugs came to her door.

Shot in Chest, Seriously Injured

One of them immediately pulled out a gun and fired at Yiyuan, hitting her in the chest. The bullet passed through her back. Yiyuan fell to the ground in a pool of blood. The assailant, seeing that his goal had been achieved, left. Her family called the Zhabei Police Station, which dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives armed to the teeth to round up the area, but the assailant had already escaped. Wang Xiaomei and three tailors who were working in the hall were arrested for questioning. The injured person was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment, her injuries were serious, and her life was in danger. According to a resident who witnessed the incident, both of the assailants were wearing long gowns, and one of them

Motive Suspected to Be Jealousy

had spent the night with Wang Sanyuan at the brothel the night before. In the middle of the night, the two sides suddenly quarreled and made a lot of noise. Wang Xiaomei came out to mediate, saying that they could talk about it tomorrow. Unexpectedly, Sanyuan was assassinated yesterday. Therefore, the motive for the assassination may be jealousy. The police are currently investigating and arresting the assailant.

### Passenger Uses Force to Rob Guide Girl, Qian Wenda Arrested

Xu Meili, a 22-year-old woman from Haining, is a guide girl at the Dou Pai Xingyue Guide Agency at 759 Jiujiang Road. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, Xu received a phone call from a man surnamed Min, asking her to go to room 209 of the Jue Lu Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. Xu went as requested and found four or five men in the room. They told Xu that they were unable to repay their gambling debts, so they asked her to help them. After speaking, one of them stuffed a ball of cotton into Xu's mouth to prevent her from making noise. Xu immediately struggled and tried to snatch Xu's small diamond ring worth 250 yuan and a watch. Xu struggled and spat out the cotton, calling for help. The tea server Wang Yonglai heard the noise and opened the door to check. The men, seeing that they had been exposed, fled. One of them, Qian Wenda (from Suzhou), fled to the entrance of the Jue Lu Hotel, where he was encountered and arrested by Chinese Detective Zhou Zhenxing of the Zhabei Police Station. He was sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for robbery under Article 328 of the law, and requested a postponement for further interrogation of his accomplices. Judge Qian Hongye questioned him and ordered him to be detained pending further interrogation.

Old News Copied Anew Sixty-Seven Years Ago (373)

(See this newspaper from the twelfth year of Tongzhi of the late Qing Dynasty)

### Prohibition of Manufacturing Copper Utensils

Recently, new copper has been difficult to obtain. The Yunnan mines cannot cover the costs, and transportation is expensive. Furthermore, since the cessation of minting in various provinces, new currency is not being issued, and old coins are scarce. Small coins are also being adulterated, and despite prohibitions, the root cause lies in the shortage of large coins and the low price of silver. The daily consumption of silver by the populace is considerable. If prohibitions were not in place, more than half of a string of coins would be made up of thin, brittle shells, causing losses to the people in their daily transactions, while private casters would reap substantial profits. The real reason for the shortage of large coins is that copper is used extensively in everyday items, second only to tin, tiles, bamboo, and wood. As these items wear out, they must be replaced annually. Consequently, due to the lack of new copper, copper workshops acquire copper by buying large coins, leading to a widespread practice of destroying coins for profit and a reluctance to buy scrap copper. In the early years of the Xianfeng era, a string of Qing coins from the Shunzhi, Kangxi, and Yongzheng reigns could still fetch forty or fifty cash. People would often select coins with the "Tong," "Fu," and other twenty characters, as well as those known as "chicken claw Guan Li," from their accounts at the end of the year and string them together. This was because the value of copper was such that even unscrupulous people did not consider such actions. Today, among a thousand coins, one might find no more than four or five of these coins, or none at all. Is it merely that mischievous children pick them out as treasures to collect? Not necessarily. It is clear that the destruction of coins for casting utensils has consumed a significant amount of the treasures of those three dynasties!

Someone has proposed prohibiting the use of copper utensils by the people, substituting them with lead and tin, which is also a good solution.

### A Person of the World (I)

The world is gradually shrinking. In the past, farmers were separated by fields and did not interact; countries were blocked by high mountains, preventing communication; and ethnic groups were divided by oceans, hindering connection. Therefore, the world at that time felt vast and expansive. Now, due to scientific progress, everything has changed: farmers have automobiles, connecting villages into one; countries have railways, turning high mountains into plains; and various regions have radio, making news from one place instantly a topic of conversation worldwide. As a result, all five continents today have become neighbors, all countries seem to be trading on a single street, and all families exchange food, clothing, and everything else. However, from another perspective, the world has also become a terrifying place. Small villains who could only harm society in the past can now threaten the world. Archers of old can now become artillerymen, capable of hitting targets a hundred kilometers away. Robbers of the past can now become political leaders, sitting in offices and openly stealing the people's money. A jealous woman can poison a reservoir, harming the lives of the entire city. A few local traitors, scattered internationally, can use radio to stir up global turmoil. A pirate can now become a king, commanding submarines and controlling the fate of a nation. In this light, we modern people must reduce our greed and arrogance compared to our ancestors; otherwise, with such rapid scientific progress, the harm and disasters inflicted upon humanity will be a thousand times greater than before. I remember being told as a child that the sun is a burning world, and when its flames are extinguished, all places will become dark, and all life will cease. (To be continued).

### Cultivating New Moral Standards

— Cheng Yanquan

The invention of the steam engine has transformed the entire world. The surge of capitalism has swept into China, changing China's politics, economy, education, culture, religion, and even the psychology, consciousness, and moral standards of every individual. In this intersection of old and new, great conflicts have arisen in society. Everywhere there is turmoil and unrest, everywhere there are disputes and unease. Old scholars, unable to accept this, shake their heads and sigh, "People's hearts are not what they used to be, and the world is declining!"

After the "cataclysmic" upheaval of the May Fourth Movement, old ethics and old social concepts were simply piles of trampled weeds in the eyes of young people, or at most, some leaky fences. After the old morality was thoroughly discredited, new morality could not be quickly established to take its place. Thus, we rely only on our own will to determine our path in life, without a clear set of rules to guide our lives. However, people's minds differ as do their faces, and if society lacks rules, it will lack order. The articles of law are limited, and the best rules are naturally those of social morality, because legal principles are nothing more than human sentiments.

Social morality is thus necessary, but it cannot be established overnight. It is not as concrete and codified as law; it is often unwritten law. Its formation does not require government orders, but rather mutual resonance in the human spirit. If the majority of people have a consensus, this moral standard can form a solid Great Wall in the human spirit. Therefore, sound moral standards need to be gradually cultivated.

In cultivating new moral standards, please do not ignore the old morality. This is certainly not because the author is infatuated with skeletons and wants to revive corpses. Over thousands of years, ancestral teachings have been preserved and followed because they have many objective values. At the very least, they are products of Chinese history, possessing the characteristics of the Chinese nation and its cultural background, and should not be indiscriminately dismissed. Secondly, we should also adopt advanced social ethics from the West to a considerable extent. This is not aimless flattery of foreigners; our selection must be based on our objective standpoint.

The first objective condition for cultivating social moral standards is rationalization. For example, parents often force their children to sacrifice their own will and obey in order to satisfy their own desires. This attitude needs to be modified. Even more problematic is that parents stubbornly insist on taking views that cannot adapt to the times and violate human nature as heavenly doctrines. If children follow them without question, they will naturally suffer endless troubles. If children discover their mistakes, they will find their parents' nagging tiresome and hateful. Secondly, in addition to rationality, fairness is required. For example, unkind fathers and unfilial sons should be equally condemned by society, and husbands who take concubines and wives who are unfaithful should be equally discriminated against by society. If social classes are still permitted, then superiors must be benevolent to subordinates, and subordinates can then respect superiors. Thirdly, new moral standards must be adapted to the times, able to suit the state and ideals of modern life. For example, "While parents are alive, one should not travel far," which is a morality of a stable rural society, should no longer exist in today's complex life. Fourthly, new morality must conform to the ideals of national construction and the trend of world progress. For example, "Good men should not be soldiers" and "Women should return to the kitchen" are not principles that should be adopted.

I hope that everyone can distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, and use human pride and inferiority to promote good and condemn evil, cultivating good ethics and teachings.

### Not Eating and Not Dying

— Liu Daohong

Mr. Carlo Argot, a famous announcer for American news in this city, told the following story in the Mainland News a few days ago:

Ten months ago, a Jewish refugee fled from Austria to Shanghai. He told a friend that he planned to do some business in Shanghai and live there. The friend asked him what kind of business he wanted to run, and he replied confidently, "When you first arrive in a strange place, the safest and most reliable businesses are bakeries and funeral parlors. Because people cannot live without eating, and they are sure to die. So there will always be business." Recently, this friend ran into him again and asked how his business was going. He replied with a mournful face, "Terrible. Shanghai is a strange place; many people cannot afford bread; and they don't want to die."

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### Refining Copper

— Dai Fei

Pessimistic poets compare life to an empty dream, a dream woven from countless strands of sorrow. But this is merely futile sentimentality, inevitably leading to pointless moaning. A great poem is never simply a flashing of many empty words; it must have experienced many real dangers. It is a luminous body that has been, or is being, tempered by life (including all its pain and darkness). Gorky was completely tempered by life, so his literary works have lasting value, just like the lasting quality of "truth."

People living in dark circumstances are in pain, but they are also fortunate! Because all pain is precisely the budding of happiness: the deeper the pain suffered, the greater the happiness gained. The happiness gained from pain is true happiness.

Therefore, before great good fortune arrives, all tempering is inevitable. In a world where black and white are confused, only you can grasp the compass of life to avoid going astray. Use reason to judge right and wrong, use passion to inspire courage, and use the environment as a laboratory to forge yourself into an unyielding steel.

Psychology

### Child Psychological Clinic

— Yang Tongfang

Recently, it was reported that the Friends of the Quakers in this city are preparing to establish a child psychological clinic, which will soon be established. The clinic specializes in child guidance and protection, aiming to eliminate psychological disorders and improve children's lives. On an island full of homeless children, this work is really in line with the current needs.

As early as 1915, Dr. W. Healy in the United States believed that to reduce crime, one should start by studying individual psychology, so he established a children's mental hospital in Chicago. Prior to this, the University of Pennsylvania had established a psychological clinic in 1896, but the use of scientific methods to study children's criminal behavior began with Healy's hospital. This hospital had a great impact on society and made unique contributions to the Chicago Children's Court. Later, Judge Harvey H. Baker of Boston also imitated the establishment of a mental hospital. In recent years, many hospitals in Massachusetts and New York have added psychological counseling services, and the National Committee for Mental Hygiene is promoting them vigorously. The organization of children's psychological clinics has tended to spread from the United States to various European countries.

Child psychological counseling is a very important child welfare undertaking. In today's complex society, children who conflict with their environment or cannot adapt often develop behavioral disorders. If these psychological problems are not treated early, they will affect lifelong happiness. From the perspective of social security, children with behavioral disorders often cause various criminal events that are sufficient to disrupt social order. Therefore, problematic children with psychological disorders need treatment, just as people with physical weakness need treatment. The reason why problematic children need treatment is that they conflict with the social environment, feel difficulty in adapting to life, have unstable emotions, and lack balanced personality. This situation is easy for us to see. Many children like to cheat, lie, steal, mock others, abuse domestic animals, or have depressed personalities, arrogant attitudes, or even indulge in daydreams, and are capricious. Generally, parents and teachers often think that it is innate and cannot be created. In fact, these abnormal behaviors all have reasons. We must not ignore the influence of the acquired environment. The task of the clinic is to recruit social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and experienced doctors to work together to study the causes of children's mental illnesses and determine treatment plans. Modern psychological hygiene knowledge is especially helpful for counseling, because the purpose of the clinic and the purpose of psychological hygiene are both to promote children's mental health. Naturally, the responsibility for treating psychological illnesses should be borne jointly by children's parents, school teachers, courts, and social organizations. The clinic is a comprehensive liaison organization, and its main function is to draw the attention of social persons to the prevention of children's aberrant behavior and the correction of deviant behavior.

The children's psychological clinic serves purely criminal, psychologically abnormal, and homeless children. It needs doctors who have special research on psychiatry to preside over it, and it also needs the cooperation of psychologists who are proficient in measurement tests. In addition, there must be enthusiastic social workers to analyze the social situation. Before the war, the Psychological Society of Datong University had established a children's psychological clinic to conduct case studies, but it has been suspended for a long time. The establishment of such a clinic in this city recently has benefited society immensely, and because it is co-operated by psychiatrists, psychologists, and social service workers of the church, it will surely have satisfactory results!

Editor's note: Recently, the "Shanghai Mental Hygiene Promotion Association," which is composed of Chinese and foreign people in this city, has also established a "Children's Guidance Clinic" in Tongren Hospital on Jiujiang Road, to help all walks of life deal with problematic children and mentally retarded children in a scientific way. The time is every Wednesday from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM.

Essays

### A Better Life

— Li Yongyun

If we can live a little happier, why must we suffer? If we can have better material enjoyment, why must we abandon it? Isn't the purpose of our efforts to make us live a better life?

However, having said that, it is not without conditions. The focus is on the distance of the horizon. We oppose the situation where a very small number of people are happy, while the majority of people wallow in the quagmire of suffering; we do not agree with the extravagant enjoyment of a few people, while countless people are groaning on the brink of starvation and death. We abhor deformity and seek fairness.

However, what we see now is exactly what we do not want to see. Manipulation, monopoly, self-interest, building one's own happiness on the suffering of others, ugly faces, and vicious hearts, but this does not prevent us from establishing our own life ideals, and it is even more urgent.

Obsessive pursuit of fame and wealth and simple material enjoyment can easily numb a person. Although we are not Platonists, we have the right to awaken everyone to the necessity of paying attention to spiritual life. People should maintain their pure and just conscience.

Therefore, in such a turbulent and dangerous environment, we must see the compass clearly and hold the rudder firmly, and we must never let the ship of life lose its direction.

We need to enjoy, but if we have to exchange it with despicable and filthy hearts, then we should respectfully decline. Moreover, we must remember that we should strive to make everyone live a better life. If material enjoyment is not good, but spiritual life is pleasant, then it is worth it. Because we live a meaningful life.

### A Record of Li Xuefang, the Elder Statesman of Cantonese Opera

— Traveling Reporter

The famous Cantonese opera actress Li Xuefang has been away from the red carpet stage for a long time. For many years, since marrying a Cantonese businessman, Wei Jun, she has been living at home in seclusion. When Guangzhou fell, she quietly came to Shanghai, just like Mei Wan-hua in Hong Kong, unwilling to easily show her face on the stage again.

Recently, when all circles in Shanghai held a charity broadcast to aid the victims of the Zhongshan disaster, Xuefang was urged by relatives, friends, gentry, and merchants in Shanghai and was also concerned about the relief of her homeland's disaster victims. Therefore, she made an exception and appeared on the glass radio station of the New Asia Hotel at the same time as the famous actress Cheng Yanqiu, broadcasting for about an hour, with excellent results.

The success of an artist is by no means accidental. Xuefang is known for her Hua Dan (young female) roles, but she also has deep attainments in Changkao martial arts. Her famous works, such as "Daiyu Burying Flowers," "Shilin Sacrificing the Pagoda," "Cao Dajia," "Bitter Fate," "Green Jade Leaving Life," and "Yang Honglei," have captivated thousands of Cantonese opera lovers. Li Xuefang is very familiar in South China, but perhaps few people in Shanghai know about her. However, the beautiful story of "Southern Li and Northern Mei, two fragrant flowers" may have remained in the hearts of some people in Shanghai.

According to the reporter, Xuefang will soon go to Hong Kong Island because of the Hong Kong theatrical performance to relieve the victims of the Zhongshan disaster and to raise funds for the Shanghai Difficult Women's Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital. She is almost forty years old this year, and she did not expect that this artist's middle age is still so active in the art world.

### Li Xuefang's Still Photos

### After Watching "Suo Lin Nang" (Part 1)

— Only Me

Cheng Yanqiu's new play "Suo Lin Nang" began its performance on the 29th of last month. The reporter went to watch it and briefly expressed his humble opinions as follows:

The story of this play, as previously recorded in this publication, is quite powerful in its contrast between rich and poor, as well as in its depiction of charitable karma. The entire script gives people a very clear impression. However, the personality of the protagonist, Xue Xiangling, makes people question it, but this is not because Yanqiu cannot portray Xue Xiangling's personality, but because he is subject to the plot. Because at the beginning of the play, Xue Xiangling is described as an inexperienced, pampered young lady. Even a face towel has to be changed again and again, and in the end, it is thrown on the ground because she does not like it. Although this is a small detail, it can be seen that Xue Xiangling has a bad temper and a great sense of vanity. There are also a few other places that tell us that Xue Xiangling is a difficult lady to serve. However, on the day she got married, the sedan encountered a heavy storm halfway through, and they took refuge in the Chunqiu Pavilion. Later, another sedan arrived, and the person in the sedan cried sadly because she was poor and married and was blocked by the rain. Xiangling actually expressed pity, which seemed very reluctant. Although everyone has compassion, because the description of Xiangling's vanity and temper in the previous section was quite excessive, this scene feels untenable. My reason is that Xue Xiangling's previous impression would never care about the affairs of an unknown poor person, and even give away her private savings, the "Suo Lin Nang" of jewelry. Since the key to the whole play lies in this scene of giving away the Suo Lin Nang, it is better to describe Xue Xiangling as a charitable and benevolent woman as much as possible in the previous part. This would not hinder the contrast between rich and poor, as well as how pampered a young lady is, and it can increase the strength of the entire play with the theme of "charity."

Also, Xiangling's Suo Lin Nang was given to Zhao Shouzhen and his daughter. Shouzhen's husband, Lu Shengchou, seems to be unaware of the situation. It is said that the Shengchou couple became rich through business because of the Suo Lin Nang, so there should be some explanation. Before Fool Yi and Fool Ren went up, there should be a scene with the Shengshou couple, in which Shengchou explains how they became rich through business, how they missed their benefactor, how they worshiped the Suo Lin Nang day and night, and how they set up a porridge shed at great expense due to the Dengzhou flood, fearing that the benefactor was buried in the belly of the fish, and provided extensive relief. Such scenes are essential. At the same time, in a continuous scene, the Shengchou couple should go to the small building to offer incense, because since it is said to be incense day and night, there should be incense, but the small building seen on that day, although there was a table and a niche, there was no incense. In order to fully develop the Shengchou couple's gratitude for the grace, it should be done realistically, and the scene of the couple offering incense is even more indispensable. Although there are many dark scenes in the play (the so-called Understood), it still depends on how it is related to the script. If it is to save time, then in the second scene, the old and young matchmakers have a long dialogue, which is meaningless and can be cancelled. If it is said that this dialogue describes people's snobbery, then it is similar to the dialogue between Hu Jie and Cheng Jun later on. There is also a scene of Mother Hu after the flood. A few of Mother Hu's colloquial words also feel vulgar, and it is best to reduce them to one or two sentences. In the scene where Xiangling accompanies the young master to play, the paper-cut cows and paper horses feel cold, so it is better to have the young master directly throw the ball and accidentally fall downstairs, which would be more tense. The above-mentioned points are about the arrangement of the script, and a few points that affect the stage. In terms of consciousness, it is satisfactory.

### Thoughts on Domestic Films

— Yixing

A certain director talked about his five points of view on Chinese films:

(1) There is no "battlefield," "ballroom," or "love scene" in Chinese films. (Those who have seen "Absolute Beauty"... must not deny the first point. The awkwardness of the "ballroom" is also well known, and the "love scene" has always been symbolized by a pair of birds flying together in China.)

(2) There is no moving "air" behind the characters in Chinese films, that is, there is no such thing as a background on the screen.

(3) Chinese films force people to tears with "drama" (such as "Fisherman's Song" and "Sister Flowers"), not with "depiction."

(4) The performances of foreign (usually referring to Hollywood) stars are all "just right," while the performances of Chinese stars are either "insufficient" or "over the top."

(5) Foreign films emphasize "truth" before "beauty," while Chinese films emphasize "beauty" before "truth."

The reporter believes that most of the director's opinions are still accurate, but hopes that he can provide some constructive opinions after criticizing.
