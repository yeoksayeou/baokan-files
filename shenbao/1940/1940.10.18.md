### The Chinese Government Receives Official Notification from the British Side: The Burma Road Resumes Transportation Today; Hundreds of Loaded Trucks Stand Ready, Equipped with Military Supplies to Enter China; a Japanese Newspaper Claims the International Situation Has Reached a Most Important Juncture; a Japanese Military Officer Declares Bombings Will Be Carried Out

Chongqing: The British government has decided to reopen the Burma Road as scheduled. The Chinese government has received official notification from the British government that the road will resume transportation on the 18th. Zeng Jue-long has been ordered to go to Yangon to preside over matters related to transportation; it is said that no ceremony will be held. (Dispatch of the 17th)

Yangon: According to news from Lashio on the Sino-Burmese border, hundreds of loaded trucks are now preparing to simultaneously transport military supplies into China when the Burma Road reopens today. Transport workers are loading goods day and night. The rainy season has passed, and the road conditions are good. Taking advantage of the moonlight this month, the trucks will be able to travel the 700-mile road to Kunming at a suitable speed, pressing on with all possible haste. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)

Chongqing: On the eve of the reopening of the Burma Road, the Chinese authorities here are preparing to rapidly process thousands of tons of military supplies that will be transported north from the Burmese border. Thousands of transport vehicles, which are extremely important for military supplies, are currently stationed in Lashio, awaiting orders to move north. The vehicles are loaded with supplies from Britain and the United States, which accumulated in Yangon and other parts of Burma during the period when the Burma Road was closed. It is said that during the closure, the Chinese authorities made efforts to increase the road's capacity. (International News Agency dispatch of the 17th)

Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun believes that the reopening of the Burma Road is a retaliatory move by Britain and the United States against the Tripartite Pact. It will issue a warning today, stating that if the British authorities disregard Japan's attitude and use Hong Kong as a base for anti-Japanese activities, the Japanese government will be forced to adopt "appropriate and effective strategies." The newspaper continued, stating that the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong has already visited the Hong Kong authorities to urge them to pay attention to the fact that goods prohibited from transport on the Burma Road also apply in Hong Kong. Although the British currently believe that the reopening of the Burma Road also takes effect in Hong Kong, according to the Anglo-Japanese Agreement, items prohibited from Burma do not simultaneously expire in Hong Kong. The Kokumin Shimbun claimed that after the reopening of the Burma Road, international developments will reach a most important juncture, for this obstacle given to Japan by Britain and the United States will also be a touchstone for Japan's determination to quickly end the China Incident and establish "Greater East Asia." The situation of merely posturing is over, and now action is needed to urge Britain and the United States to awaken. (United Press dispatch of the 17th)

Hanoi: Colonel Nakatsuchi, head of the Japanese Naval Commission in Vietnam, told a United Press reporter here today that Japanese aircraft in Vietnam will bomb a section of the Burma Road within Chinese territory tomorrow morning, weather permitting. It is said that Japanese aircraft will destroy the Burma Road as quickly as possible after it reopens. The main goal of the Japanese naval representative here is to establish an air base for bombing China. As for air bases in Vietnam, Japan needs to increase them in addition to Haiphong. The French authorities may agree on this point, because since Japan allied with Germany and Italy, the Vichy government has been under the control of the Hitler government, and Germany will be able to make France cooperate with Japan. Nakatsuchi also said that Japan would not attack Hong Kong, calling Hong Kong "a rotten apple." Japan does not need to shake its trunk to make it fall, nor does it maintain fruit. (United Press dispatch of the 17th)

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today prominently published the news of the Burma Road's reopening at midnight tonight. Japanese newspapers said that Japan "is watching the development of the situation with a calm and stern attitude, because Japan is firmly determined to reduce the assistance of third countries to the Chongqing government." Recently, Japanese newspapers have not paid attention to the expansion of the United States' military power, only publishing a short message about the registration of 16.4 million Americans for military service yesterday. Roosevelt's speech on "Registration Day" was also given unimportant attention. The Asahi Shimbun, which usually publishes lengthy special dispatches from Washington and New York, also did not publish any news about American defense today. (United Press dispatch of the 17th)

Yangon: Chinese diplomat Zeng Rongfu, who is now in Yangon for the reopening of the Burma Road, told a Reuters reporter that most of China's war necessities now come from the United States. Although the United States is engaged in a great war, it is also doing its best to help China. What China urgently needs now are heavy artillery, aircraft, and anti-aircraft guns. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)

Tokyo: Newspapers prominently published on the front page the news that the British government intends to lift the ban on the transport of arms, bullets, and other supplies to China via Hong Kong, along with reaction news, hinting that the Japanese government will take strong measures to deal with it. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)

London: According to responsible sources in London, the Hong Kong-China route was closed by order of the Governor of Hong Kong in January 1939 for security reasons. No guarantees were given to Japan before the Burma Road Agreement was concluded; a guarantee was only made in that agreement. Therefore, since the Burma Road Agreement expires today, Britain's guarantee regarding Hong Kong also ends simultaneously. The order to close the road will continue and will be entirely at the discretion of the Governor of Hong Kong, because the importance of the Hong Kong route is limited due to the geographical position of the Japanese navy and army. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)

London: According to unofficial sources, the Burma Road, which has been closed for three months, will reopen today, but military supplies will continue to be transported to China. Although there has been no official announcement, well-informed sources claim that when the Burmese government rescinds its order to close the road, the transport of arms will resume, because the aforementioned order was issued on the advice of the British government. Therefore, it is generally believed that it is only a technicality that will be quickly resolved. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)

Tokyo: Well-informed sources here believe that the Japanese side will not only bomb the Chinese section of the Burma Road but also bomb Hong Kong if it resumes arms transport to China. Both routes, "west" and east, are within easy reach of Japanese bombers. The Japanese side will issue an "important declaration regarding the situation soon." (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)

Lashio: Sixty of the first batch of trucks will drive to the Sino-Burmese border seven minutes after midnight tonight. Twenty minutes later, other trucks will follow. It is expected that all 200 trucks will be transported out before dawn. (United Press dispatch of the 17th)

Lashio: Preparations for reopening the Burma Road at midnight tonight to transport military supplies to the Chongqing government have been completed today. Midnight tonight marks the expiration of the three-month Anglo-Japanese agreement to close the Burma Road and the beginning of Britain's new, stronger policy towards Japan. According to Chinese sources on the Burmese border, military preparations to protect cargo transport on the Chinese section of the Burma Road have been completed, and it is expected that the Chinese section of the road will be attacked by Japanese aircraft by dawn. Also, Chinese officials here recently stated that the Chongqing government has taken appropriate measures to protect the Burma Road from Japanese bombing, and said that the Japanese will have to attack the targets along the road from a very high altitude, which would likely result in inaccurate bombing. A Chinese official said, "We are not afraid of bombs, and the trucks must pass through." With the permission of the authorities, reporters visited various warehouses and loading areas today, and learned that the first step is to transport a large amount of accumulated military supplies to Chongqing. In one loading area, reporters saw 2,000 dark gray American trucks being loaded by 5,000 workers of different nationalities. Under the scorching midday sun, Indians, Chinese, Thais, Burmese, and Miao people hummed and sweated as they carried weapons and other military supplies into hundreds of American trucks, preparing for departure at midnight. Large signs reading "No Smoking" and "No Photography" were posted everywhere in the loading area. The Chinese official said, "Our slogan is to engage in all preparations for tonight's reopening of the northern route, and the trucks are about to leave." Mr. Potter, the manager of the Burma Road, recently told a United Press reporter that he was very pleased to see the Burma Road reopen and military supplies transported to China. Potter praised the methods China had taken to prepare for the reopening of the road in the three months since it was closed, and said that even when it was known that the road would reopen, China's efforts did not stop. China will not hold a celebration for the reopening of the road. At this time of the road's reopening, China's expression is only of arduous work. The local authorities have paid attention to detecting Japanese spies who are trying to get the Japanese air base in Vietnam to know the time when the trucks enter China. On October 11, a member of the Japanese consulate arrived here from Yangon, but suddenly left the next day. The consulate member came to see the reopening of the road, but the police officers here immediately advised him, saying that the Burmese authorities could hardly guarantee their safety. The police authorities told the Japanese that there were no fewer than a thousand patriotic Chinese living in Lashio, so the Japanese returned to Yangon the next day. Among the goods to be transported to China starting tonight, there are also a large number of Japanese goods. These goods were left here together with British and American goods after the road was closed a month ago. According to well-informed sources, since the Japanese navy tightened its blockade of the Chinese coast, Japanese merchants often transported large quantities of their goods to free China via Burma. Most of the Japanese goods transported to China via Burma are decorated with Chinese trademarks, so that the Chinese believe they are buying domestic products. The first batch of goods to be loaded tonight may be test goods, and other goods will not be transported until after the Japanese aircraft bomb the Chinese section of the road. It is said that among these test goods, there will be some Japanese textiles, and it is believed that British and American arms and aircraft will be transported later this week. An inspection of the road shows that neither China nor Britain neglected this road during the three-month closure. During these three months, goods transported to China continued to enter Burma, and now they are concentrated at the border, ready for rapid transport. At 2:00 PM today, British customs officials began inspecting the first batch of goods to be transported to China, so that the batch of goods could be transported out by midnight.

Editorial
— A Look at the Reopening of the Burma Road

"Like a white colt glimpsed through a crack, it passes in a flash." All too often, there is only a despondent sigh, which is all too often rather pointless. But when Britain succumbed to Japan, blocking the transport of military supplies on the Burma Road for a period of three months, it has finally come to an end today. Recalling the scene at the beginning: the Japanese side was arrogant, as if holding a person by the throat, with victory in hand; the British government endured humiliation, and members of Parliament rebuked the diplomatic authorities in Parliament as "shameful, truly shameful!" France smiled bitterly, using this as an excuse for continued concessions and compromises to violence in the future; Germany and Italy sneered from the sidelines, and world opinion was in uproar, mostly believing that it would lead to unfortunate consequences. All of these things are still fresh in our minds, but now the Burma Road seems to be governed by an irresistible natural law and has finally resumed its function. From today onwards, we will see large quantities of military supplies winding through thousands of mountains, continuously entering China. This will surely please the people of both China and Britain, as well as the international friendship between the two countries. But there must be those who lament the passage of time. Victory depends on time; time is on China's side, belonging to China!

After the Burma Road regains its vitality, the total amount of military supplies transported into China each day will be from 300 to 500 tons. Three to five hundred tons is not a small number. Over time, it will be even more impressive. But in large-scale modern warfare, this number is not a particularly large number, and China's resistance war does not rely on it as the sole source. The reason why we and even the general public pay such close attention to the opening and closing of this road, and even some people in the United States a few weeks ago inferred that the reopening of this road might lead to the outbreak of war in the Pacific in the past two days, is not simply because of the daily transport volume of 300 to 500 tons of military supplies. There is another meaning that deserves extreme attention. To state the most obvious meaning: First, having a road that is not open is abnormal, cowardly, shameful, and a paradoxical and erroneous act of suppressing the weak and flattering the strong. It is a trend of civilization and morality being reversed, and a sign of violence raising its eyebrows and justice perishing. Therefore, it is not necessary to consider the size of the throughput. What is valuable is that it is open, and now it is reopened. Moreover, 300 to 500 tons per day is not a small number in itself. Second, at the beginning of the Burma Road's closure, and even recently, the British side did not deny to Japan that it hoped to promote a reconciliation of the Sino-Japanese War within these three months of closure. Reconciliation values equality and parity. If a one-sided blockade is used to promote reconciliation, it is known that the goal sought is to unilaterally give the other side the opportunity to force the other party to submit. China has its self-confidence, so it has never made ruthless criticisms of Britain because of this from the beginning. Now that it has passed like a solar eclipse, there is no need to say more. However, the agreement was concluded under the pursuit of the past, and now it is dissolved under the current situation. This one opening and one closing accurately shows that China's war of resistance has spanned three or four years, experienced countless hardships, and remains unyielding. It also shows that the conspiracy to force China to submit has ultimately failed, all under the watchful eyes of the world, with a clear and powerful explanation of positive and negative. Third, when Britain succumbed to Japan and closed the Burma Road, laughing and scolding were from others, and it was forced to do so. It was not its original wish. It was nothing more than being frightened by Germany's continued victories in Europe and the precarious state of the British Isles. Although the British authorities spoke loudly and did not show weakness, it can be seen from their subservience to Japan that they were timid and discouraged, and they were worried that they would not be able to protect themselves. Therefore, they were afraid and dared not firmly reject Japan's demands, and could not resist Japan's intimidation and coercion. Now, Germany's offensive and Japan's intimidation and coercion not only still exist, but are also intensifying. Britain not only did not accept further demands, but also did not continue to make other concessions. They resolutely decided to abolish the humiliating agreement at the end of its term. It can be seen that Britain has been able to regain its self-confidence in the future of the war and the fate of the empire. The conflict between Britain and Germany, involving victory, defeat, survival, and death, was originally something that outsiders did not need to be very concerned about. However, since the establishment of the Tripartite Pact, it has no longer been possible to ignore the changes between them. Therefore, the confidence of the British side reflected by the opening of the Burma Road should be seen as containing an unusual meaning. Fourth, the factors for Britain's regained confidence are certainly not limited to one. However, the United States' national policy has become stronger and clearer, evolving from understatement to action, from sympathy and tacit understanding with Britain to open and unlimited assistance, and from principled support to concrete responses to each individual problem and individual purpose. For example, Secretary of State Hull declared that the United States would take responsibility for the impact of the Burma Road's reopening. This is the dawn of an ambiguous world, a great event concerning the overall situation! Fifth, the empty threats and coercive postures have been tested by the reopening of the Burma Road and have become a relic of international tactics. Eliminating this type of tactic can largely bring clarity to the international aspect. In the future, the only things that can become problems must be actual new actions with actual power. Although the disillusionment of threats and coercion does not limit the beginning of new actions, new actions must carefully consider their inevitable reactions and consequences due to the ineffectiveness of threats and coercion. Therefore, after the reopening of the Burma Road, we can imagine that tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, as well as the near future, may instead see superficial calm, that is, temporarily not hearing any childish boasting. It is also conceivable that all parties are engaged in arrangements and brewing for a decisive evolution, until some kind of sudden change breaks out.

From these five points, the reopening of the Burma Road is valued by the world. In addition to the five points, we still believe that there are other meanings, but there is no need to discuss them in detail today. What can be silently observed is that Konoe, the apparent new leader of Japan, and his subordinate Matsuoka, after exhausting their efforts and shouting at the top of their lungs to obstruct the reopening of the Burma Road and ultimately failing, what will they do besides trying ineffective bombings that cannot cut off traffic? How will they maintain their prestige and credibility that have not yet been firmly established?

### Hull to Deliver Speech; U.S. to Strengthen Far East Policy; Actively Negotiating with Australia; Canada Bans Tin Exports to Japan

Washington: The State Department announced that Secretary of State Hull will deliver a speech on foreign policy on October 25. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)

Washington: Senior government officials here continue to closely monitor the situation in the Far East, and the United States is stepping up negotiations to strengthen its tough policy in the Far East. President Roosevelt met with Australian Minister to Washington Casey, and it is believed that they reviewed the entire situation in the Far East. It is said that the issue of closer cooperation between the United States and Australia in the Pacific was the main point of discussion. Casey subsequently declined to comment on whether he had discussed the U.S. Navy's borrowing of the Singapore naval base with President Roosevelt. Casey told reporters, "It is best not to make special mention of such matters at this time." Later, the Australian Minister had a lengthy meeting with Secretary of State Hull, and it is believed that they continued negotiations that began several months ago, when Britain suggested that the United States borrow the Singapore naval base and other naval and air bases in the Pacific. The impression among well-informed circles here is that after most American expatriates have withdrawn from the Far East, the current British, American, and Australian talks can be clarified. (United Press dispatch of the 17th)

Ottawa: According to authoritative sources, Canada may not reissue permits for tin exports to Japan. New Westminster Mayor Hume said that he would do everything in his power to prevent the lead ingots previously permitted to be shipped from New Westminster. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

Quebec: News came from the summer residence of Canadian Governor General Earl Athlone yesterday that Earl and Countess Athlone will visit President Roosevelt in Hyde Park, New York at the end of the week. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)

Washington: The current Canadian Governor General, Earl Athlone, is about to visit President Roosevelt. This trip is of an informal nature and is different from the formal visit of former Canadian Governor General Tweedsmuir in 1937. Although Athlone's trip has no political significance, officials here say that it is another example of the close friendship between Canada and the United States. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

U.S. Navy Advocates Borrowing Singapore to Effectively Deal with Far East Crisis

Washington: Senior naval officers declared last night that if the United States does not borrow the Singapore naval base, the U.S. fleet will experience difficulties in the event of an incident. It is said that from a diplomatic standpoint, there may be considerable obstacles to establishing this agreement with Britain, but considering it from a purely naval standpoint, this move is necessary, because if the Singapore naval base is not borrowed, the U.S. Navy will inevitably encounter various serious difficulties in operating in the Far East. However, once this base is adopted, the U.S. Navy can immediately and effectively deal with the crisis in the Far East and prevent the enemy from approaching the China Sea from the southwest. Naval experts here point out that Singapore controls all the major oil sources in Malaya, so the fleet stationed in Singapore will not have any fuel problems. It is said that the Singapore naval base is large enough to accommodate the entire U.S. fleet, as it is larger than Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. As for food, it is shipped from Australia to Singapore, and arms and other supplies can be shipped from the United States to Singapore via the Cape of Good Hope, which is easier than via the Pacific. (United Press dispatch of the 17th)

New York: Former Secretary of the Navy Johnson delivered a broadcast speech today, saying, "We are not prepared to act. In terms of complete military preparations, our achievements in two years can exceed Germany's construction in seven years. Only if Britain and its navy fall into enemy hands will we encounter an extremely dangerous situation." He also said that American aircraft are the best in the world, and currently 950 fully equipped aircraft can be produced each month. From January next year, this will reach 1,250 per month. "America's attempt to withdraw from the battlefield is more dedicated than any other country, but the result will be the destruction of American people and property in the Far East. The Germans are trying to interfere with the peace of the United States and its sister countries in the Americas." (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)

Several Prominent Professors Propose Absolute Embargo on Japan

Washington: Authoritative circles declared last night that the public's pressure on the government has gradually increased in recent weeks, so that the United States adopts a strict policy in the Far East. Recently established non-governmental organizations have repeatedly requested the government to "intensify and continue the pressure on Japan." At the same time, American newspapers have almost unanimously supported the government's tough attitude towards Japan. Recently established groups advocating strengthening Far East policy include several prominent university law professors. Led by Harvard University professor Warren Seavey, several university professors sent a letter to prestigious Americans yesterday, proposing a "three-principle program" to be adopted in the East. The three points are as follows: (1) Implement an absolute embargo on the export of electricity and important raw materials to Japan, and absolutely prohibit the import of Japanese goods. (2) Do everything possible to assist China, including unlimited credit loans and large quantities of arms and aircraft. (3) Establish an agreement with Britain to borrow the Singapore naval base and immediately send the U.S. fleet to Singapore. The university professor group announced its support for Far East policy several weeks ago, but only issued this letter yesterday. It is understood that the recipients are all prestigious members of society, most of whom are leaders in the business and education fields. The letter said, "American public opinion has changed, and America has awakened. Our country is now willing to take strong action. We are no longer burying our heads in the sand. Chamberlain's hesitation led to tragedy for Britain. We should not allow such people to mislead the United States again." (United Press dispatch of the 17th)

### Millions of American Youths Register for Draft, Supporting President Roosevelt's Declaration, Ready to Enlist for Military Training

Washington - Millions of American youths yesterday registered for the draft, preparing to enlist and receive unprecedented military training in American history. Youths across the nation, regardless of race or class, uniformly responded to President Roosevelt's declaration that "Democratic government is created by you – it is the accomplishment of the youth." Sixteen million men between the ages of 21 and 35 flocked to thousands of registration officials to obtain registration certificates. After the Senate passed the conscription process, Sir Dykstra, President of the University of Wisconsin, was appointed as the Chief Registrar. After the President announced "Registration Day" on the radio at 8:00 AM, each registration office was immediately crowded with thousands of American youths seeking registration certificates. It is understood that one out of every forty registrants will be drafted to concentrate on training before the end of 1940. In New York City, 100,000 youths have registered. In Chicago, around 500,000 have registered. Philadelphia and Los Angeles have each registered around 250,000. A few Hollywood movie stars who are not yet of legal age also joined other adult men in requesting registration. Famous actors such as Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, Ronald Colman, and Cary Grant are over the legal age and were unable to go. Unmarried actors like James Stewart and Cesar Romero have a high chance of becoming soldiers. Most of the famous actors who have already registered are married, so they have little chance of being drafted. Famous actors who have formally registered include Robert Taylor, Lew Ayres, Tony Martin, and Robert Young. Crosby, Don Ameche, Henry Fonda, and Tyrone Power also registered. Many nightclub singers and waiters registered. They went immediately after closing at 4:00 AM, waiting until 7:00 AM. In addition, millions of workers participated in registration before going to work. As a result, crowds lined up in the streets, which were extremely crowded. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Turkey Seeks to Enhance Cooperation with the Soviet Union; Soviet Union Denies Concentrating Troops on the Romanian Border

Budapest - Balkan diplomatic circles claim that Turkey is now striving to establish closer cooperation with the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that Turkey may be placed under the Soviet Union's protection, like Outer Mongolia. This action may be possible as the Russian Black Sea Fleet is heading towards the abundant Batumi oil fields on the Russian coast, where the warships will be close to Turkey. The large-scale concentration of Red Army troops in Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, near the Romanian border, has brought the garrison forces at the border to ten divisions. Political observers here, therefore, predict that Germany and Russia will "show their cards" in the Balkans sooner than expected. (International dispatch, 17th)

Bucharest - Officials of the Soviet High Delegation asked here last night denied the reports that the Soviet Union had concentrated twelve Soviet divisions on the Soviet-Romanian border due to the German army's southward invasion of the Balkans. The official stated that the report that the Soviet Union had concentrated a very large army along the Romanian border was unfounded, and that they had indeed stationed a regular number of border defense troops along the Romanian border, but had not concentrated Soviet troops at any location on the Soviet-Romanian border. According to another report, some Soviet troops had built defensive fortifications along the Soviet-Romanian border. (United Press dispatch, 7th)

Ankara - The Turkish Minister of Postal Affairs recently notified the United States, Italy, Syria, and Ecuador that the Turkish post office will not be responsible for any mail sent to Turkey in the future due to the danger of war. Turkey also bears no obligation for mail sent to Turkey from these countries. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### The Shadow of War Looms: German Planes Bomb English Countryside; Fierce Dogfights Between British and German Aircraft Over London; Britain to Employ Secret Anti-Aircraft Weapon

London – Thick clouds, misty rain, visibility reduced to a hundred yards, making it difficult to see clearly. This weather, coupled with the agile work of anti-aircraft guns, has allowed Londoners to avoid Nazi atrocities and enjoy their first peaceful sleep in recent weeks. Although the sound of aircraft soaring overhead can still be heard from time to time, only a few bombs have fallen, mostly outside the city of London. However, last night, German aircraft once again scattered leaflets over the city. This was the first time in six weeks, since the start of the intense air raids, that this has occurred. A certain county in the east has obtained these leaflets. They appear to have been attached to balloons or parachutes and dropped. However, the content of these leaflets is not yet known. It is reported that three German planes were shot down over Britain last night. According to reports this morning, although some areas of London were bombed, the majority of the air raids were focused on inland counties, with countless rural areas being bombed. Two hospitals in southeastern England were hit. The London area was generally quiet until the all-clear sounded at 6:30 AM. Although some houses in London and other places were destroyed, the Air Ministry stated that last night's air raid resulted in the least damage and fewest casualties of any night raid. London newspapers this morning generally stated that the German night raiders had restrained their arrogance, as few German aircraft were seen below the clouds last night. Therefore, the bombs that fell must have been dropped completely at random. However, the raiders occasionally swooped down from the clouds. The anti-aircraft artillery suddenly intensified their firing after hearing the sound of German planes flying from afar, from low to high. Upon seeing the heavy anti-aircraft fire, the German planes immediately retreated above the clouds. The night raids in other provinces were also not very serious, but a German plane in a village in the southwest flew low and fired a machine gun, and then dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs in another village, injuring two people. A nursery and a cottage were severely damaged. Two hospitals in a town in southeastern England were hit, one of which killed several nurses and injured several nurses and patients. German planes were also shot down in Stockport, Harwich, and other places. It is generally expected that Britain's night air defense plan, as well as other factors, will make it very difficult for German planes to raid Britain. Britain's air defense plan is very secret, but reliable sources said this morning that the new plan to resist German planes has been completed. The Daily Telegraph's air raid reporter said, "Once this plan is adopted, Hitler will see that our secret weapon is more terrifying than anything he can implement. Once this weapon is used, it will greatly surprise the Germans." (United Press dispatch, 17th)

London – German planes attacked London all night, dropping high-explosive bombs, incendiary bombs, and time bombs over London. The air raid ended at 6:00 AM this morning. The number of deaths and the extent of the damage were unprecedented. This was the 222nd air raid on London since the start of the war. British anti-aircraft fire was intensified in the air, forcing German planes to stay at high altitude and drop bombs randomly. The German planes concentrated their attack on the outskirts of London. In the fortieth consecutive night raid, four German planes were shot down by the British. Almost all of Britain suffered severe air raids this time. A certain southeastern city was subjected to terrible bombing for several hours. A certain city in the Midlands was also hit hard. Some areas of Wales were also severely hit. Liverpool, a city that is frequently raided, was no exception this time. A large air-raid shelter in the city was hit by a German bomb, and it is said that there were many deaths and injuries. In a city in southwestern England, a German bomber flew straight down and strafed crowded streets with machine guns, while also dropping many high-explosive and incendiary bombs. Although the Germans have recently bombed London all night, they have so far failed to inflict any major damage on London. (International Telegraph, 17th)

Berlin – This morning, German bomber squadrons attacked various districts in central England and the western coast south of Liverpool.

London – Today, there was very little enemy aircraft activity in the daytime. The night gradually became more intense. London was covered with low-lying clouds tonight. German bombers came and indiscriminately dropped bombs above the clouds, causing significant damage to residential areas. The first German bomber shot down tonight was shot down by anti-aircraft fire in Hertfordshire. It caught fire and burned fiercely, lasting for an hour before it was extinguished. All crew members perished in the flames. It is heard that two more German planes were shot down after that. One crashed in North Wales, and the other was damaged by anti-aircraft fire and crashed into a house in a southeastern town. Several enemy planes flew low from the southeast towards London late at night, and were subjected to particularly intense anti-aircraft fire. They hurriedly dropped high-explosive bombs and fled back to the coast. (Reuters, 17th)

London – Britain was severely attacked last night, and today's daytime was quite peaceful. It is reported that only a certain coastal town in Scotland and a place in the west had bombs dropped. King George of England drove through the bombed areas of London this afternoon and inspected the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade, listening to the Fire Brigade's report on fighting fires during air raids. He also stayed in the command room for half an hour, examining a large map of London, which marked the locations where fires had started and been extinguished. (Reuters, 17th)

Berlin – A German reconnaissance plane flew to London yesterday morning to inspect the results of the previous night's battle. It saw thirty or forty locations where major fires had recently occurred. Houses and factories were still burning, with flames reaching as high as four hundred meters. London was like a volcano. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)

Berlin – This morning, German bombers set out for England again. The first batch of German planes arrived over London at 9:50 AM. Before long, English planes took off to engage them. As a result of the fierce battle, both sides lost two planes each. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)

### British Naval and Air Forces Jointly Attack Cherbourg: Heavy German Casualties; Invasion Plans Likely to be Delayed; Three German Supply Ships Sunk

London – The London Daily Express's Madrid correspondent reported today that in the recent British naval and air attacks on Cherbourg, the German death toll was between 40,000 and 50,000. The correspondent stated that exhausted and defeated German troops have left the coastal area, and their invasion plan appears to have been at least temporarily abandoned. It is said that at least 500,000 German troops have been stationed in the key ports of the French Channel, awaiting the order to invade England for more than a month. This force is fully armed, and thousands of barges are ready to carry them across the sea to Britain. However, the naval guns and long-range artillery in the English Channel, as well as the frequent visits by British bombers, have further delayed the invasion date. A London Daily Express reporter stated that the result of the British naval and air attacks on Cherbourg last week was that the German side suffered heavy losses, and the number of dead and injured was also huge. The army has now been sent to southern France for rest and replenishment. Bayonne and Biarritz have been turned into large-scale German convalescent centers for the wounded. (International News, 17th)

London – The Air Ministry has continued to release details of the British bomber attacks on military targets and transportation within Germany on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. From this, it can be seen that the scope of the offensive taken by the British Air Force against Germany is increasing. Kiel was continuously attacked for several hours, with many tons of bombs dropped. Torpedo boat docks and nautical colleges in the harbor were hit. Major wharves, southeast of the shipyard and the Germania shipyard, were repeatedly hit by huge bombs. Another batch of bombs apparently hit oil storage tanks, causing a huge fire. Other targets bombed by the British Air Force included the Magdburg, Salzburg, and Gelsenkirch oil refineries and storage facilities, the Hamburg docks, and Cologne, Düsseldorf, and other places. A supply train near Rouen was hit by a bomb. In addition, more than 20 locations in the heart of Germany, airfields in Germany and the Netherlands, and docks and ships in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France were heavily bombed. Antwerp was attacked on Wednesday morning, with warehouses and railway lines hit and destroyed in Zeebrugge. Docks in the ports of Calais and Boulogne were also bombed by British naval aircraft. On Tuesday, British bombers, while evading German planes attempting to intercept them, bombed key targets such as sluice gates and oil ponds in Flushing. Another batch of Blenheim bombers attacked two power stations in Lorient. In addition, naval aviation and coastal command aircraft jointly attacked Brest, dropping huge bombs on port facilities and ships. Hudson aircraft were also active in the Netherlands, bombing the inner harbor of Wilhelmshaven and enemy destroyers off Texel. According to reports from the pilots who carried out the attacks, the bombings mentioned above caused heavy damage to enemy port facilities and major ship gathering locations. (Reuters, 17th)

From night to morning, military facilities on both sides of the Thames River were rained down with bombs. Military targets in Birmingham and Liverpool were also subjected to heavy bombardment. Enemy warships attempted to enter the English Channel but were blocked by German coastal artillery fire. A German submarine sank three armed merchant ships (21,000 tons) and one oil tanker (10,000 tons). Last night, English planes attacked residential areas in Germany, with no damage to military facilities.

### London Citizens Live in Stability; Traffic Maintains Normalcy

London - A Reuters correspondent reports: I inspected both banks of the River Thames in London for two hours yesterday and saw that industrial and private life are as stable as before. The German bombers that attacked London on Tuesday night continued to cause minor damage to this great city and its suburbs. Berlin's claim that London experienced "unprecedented chaos" and that "all kinds of businesses were temporarily suspended" is nothing but self-congratulatory fabrication. London's streetcars and trains run uninterrupted, and citizens work as usual. I rented a car at a place where streetcars were shuttling back and forth, and waited for a quarter of an hour because of the traffic congestion before my car could start. In a corner of central London, the cars for business trips, buses, trams, and trucks are bumper to bumper, and the congestion is no less than before the war. The reporter couldn't wait and ordered the driver to take a detour to the first station on the main railway line. Upon arriving, I saw that the trains were running smoothly as usual, and the group of citizens, many of whom were women and children, abandoned their newly bombed houses and boarded the train to go elsewhere. A railway employee said that the number of passengers was no more than usual. According to the station staff on the night shift, the trains ran smoothly yesterday morning. In the places the reporter passed, there were occasional walls collapsing and roads cracking, which was an indication that bombs had fallen nearby. Workers were busy clearing rubble. A certain area was on fire and had already been watered, and the water hoses were still scattered on the ground. Smoke billowed from the chimneys of one of London's most important power plants, and the workers were just finishing their work. The reporter stopped at a roadside cafe to have breakfast. Milk and bread were delivered on time, but the meat delivery man was half an hour late, and the owner complained annoyingly. Outside the cafe, women carrying baskets were shopping in an endless stream. The dock area was still lively. Shops and banks in the city center were open as usual. The reporter saw the scars of new and old bombs in more than a dozen areas of London, but the citizens now regard the air raids as commonplace and proceed with their work as usual. This is what moved the reporter the most. (Reuters, 17th)

### German Diplomacy Strictly Maintains Secrecy

Berlin – According to the "Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger", the attacks by Germany and Italy are not limited to London, but also pay attention to other parts of Britain. Berlin has not announced where the Axis powers will attack in the near future. According to well-informed sources, when the time is ripe, Britain will understand what kind of decisions the Axis powers have made. German officials declined to comment on reports by foreign journalists that the Axis powers are actively engaged in diplomatic activities and that they attach great importance to Southeast Europe, as this issue involves diplomatic secrets and is extremely difficult to answer. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)

### Anti-British Movement in Palestine

Hejing – According to news from Beirut, Palestinian Arabs held anti-British and anti-Jewish demonstrations yesterday and the day before. This was caused by the insult to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. It was found that on the tenth day of this month, some Jews threw stones at the Grand Mufti, and the British police nearby turned a blind eye and did not intervene. The Grand Mufti openly criticized Britain that evening, which aroused public outrage among the Arabs. There was also chaos in the Haifa Jewish Institute of Technology, caused by a Jewish student illegally carrying a handgun. The British authorities dispatched troops and tanks to suppress the riots, resulting in clashes and casualties on both sides. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

### Three Thousand American Women and Children from the Far East to Be Evacuated; Americans from Various Places Head to Shanghai to Secure Ship Berths; Men Seem Likely to Remain Temporarily Awaiting Developments; U.S. Flagship Carrying Naval Dependents Departs Today

More than 3,300 applications from American citizens in this city preparing to evacuate and reserving passage on U.S. President Lines ships have been received to date. Over 1,100 of these applications were filed by American citizens in this city, while the rest came from other cities in China and Japan, etc. According to a statement issued by a senior official of the shipping company, almost all those reserving passage are women and children, with very few men. This proves that all the children and most of the women among the American citizens in this city will be evacuated from Shanghai first, but the men are still waiting to see how things develop. Furthermore, according to a reporter from the English-language *China Press* who learned yesterday morning that the U.S. Consul General's Office in this city had issued a notice advising American citizens to evacuate and had received 2,500 responses, it is expected that more than 3,000 replies will be received. It is reported that the Chinese Consulate here will likely continue to issue notices within this week, informing American citizens who have not registered with the consulate to quickly prepare to evacuate.

Registered American Citizens: 2,500

The English-language *China Press* reports that after the U.S. Consulate issued the notice for American citizens in Shanghai to evacuate, it has received approximately 2,500 responses as of this (17th) morning. The U.S. Consulate is still awaiting the remaining responses, as more than 3,000 notices were sent to American citizens within the Shanghai Consulate district. It is also heard that the U.S. Consulate is expected to continue sending this notice to American citizens who have not registered with the consulate within this week.

Unanimous Hope for Reduced Travel Expenses

At the same time, American citizens in this city unanimously believe that shipping companies should reduce the cost of repatriation for American citizens being evacuated. They say that since the U.S. government recognizes the evacuation of American citizens in Shanghai as extremely important and is sending additional ships to the Far East, the shipping companies should understand the situation and reduce the fares for evacuating American citizens.

Over Three Thousand Reservations

Yesterday, officials at the shipping company told reporters that although payment has not yet been made for the 3,300-plus applications for ship tickets, it is believed that these are genuine reservations. Even if some are cancelled due to uncertainty, these will undoubtedly be few in number. Once the passenger ships sent to Shanghai to evacuate the overseas Chinese are about to arrive, all those who have applied to reserve tickets will be required to pay in cash first in order to make the reservation valid. This will happen within a week or two. At that time, the so-called precautionary measures will become a reality.

Only Three U.S. Ships to Evacuate Overseas Chinese

The U.S. government has slightly adjusted the schedule of four giant ships to transport evacuating overseas Chinese from the Far East. The first ship, the *Monterey* of Matson Lines, has already set sail eastward and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month. The second ship has not yet been reported to have set sail. According to U.S. shipping circles, the *Manhattan* may not be coming for the time being. Currently, it is confirmed that only the *Washington*, *Monterey*, and *Mariposa* will be coming. If necessary, the *Manhattan* will be dispatched. The ship berths reserved by American citizens in this city with U.S. President Lines have not been designated to any specific ship.

The *Augusta* Departs Today

Regarding the actions of the U.S. Navy, reporters have obtained all information from Western sources, but because the U.S. is strictly maintaining secrecy, it is often impossible to verify the information. For example, the large transport ships *Altair* and *Chaumont* were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Manila yesterday, but as of yesterday, it was said that the *Altair* would have to be delayed until around the 20th, while the *Chaumont* would not arrive until around the 10th of next month. Regarding the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, the *Augusta*, there was also talk yesterday morning that its departure from Shanghai would be delayed, but reliable sources reported last night that the *Augusta* suddenly received urgent orders yesterday afternoon and decided to depart as scheduled today. It is said that all the families of senior U.S. Navy officers planning to leave Shanghai on the ship, as well as reservists in Shanghai who have been summoned to depart, boarded the ship last night and will go to Manila today. The uncertainty of U.S. naval vessel movements is indicative of the general seriousness of the situation.

Shanghai American School to Continue Classes as Usual

Furthermore, according to reliable sources, although a large number of American women and children in this city are preparing to return home, the Shanghai American School will not suspend classes. Since the U.S. State Department issued the notice advising American citizens to evacuate, only ten students have withdrawn from the school. School officials have stated that the future of the school still depends on the decision of all American citizens. The American citizens who have applied to the U.S. Consul General's Office to prepare for evacuation may not all leave Shanghai at that time, as applying and actually doing it are two different things. Therefore, school officials do not intend to make any definite plans until the appropriate time.

### The Burma Road Reopens Today; Preparations for Freight Transportation are Busy; Shipping Companies Consider Opening Regular Shipping Routes; Daily Necessities to Be Shipped to Singapore First

The Burma Road has been reopened today. The Shanghai branch of British shipping company is considering opening a regular shipping route between Shanghai and Singapore or Rangoon. The transportation industry has dispatched a specialist to Rangoon to inspect. Regarding waterway shipping costs, negotiations have been held with various shipping companies to reduce them. Regarding land transportation, contact has been made with the National Government to dispatch trucks for transportation. It is reported that some daily necessities will be allowed to be shipped from Shanghai to Singapore, then transferred to Rangoon, and then enter Sichuan via the Burma Road. The Postal Administration has decided to find ways to import parcels to the southwest and northwest via the Burma Road.

Sino-American Trade Sees Light Again

Since China implemented a full-scale war of resistance against Japan, in addition to domestic production, its military supplies have mainly come from the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. Before the fall of Guangzhou, the import of British and American materials was through Kowloon. After the fall of Guangzhou, imports were rerouted through land routes in the southwest. Since French Indochina succumbed to Japan, and Britain adopted a policy of appeasement in the Far East, the routes through Vietnam and Burma were closed one after another. China's external communication relied solely on the Sino-Soviet Highway. The import of Soviet goods was not a problem, but the transportation of American goods to China was quite difficult. Lighter goods could still be transported via Vladivostok, through Kulun and Ningxia to Lanzhou, but heavy goods were difficult to transport. The export of tungsten sand and tung oil to the United States was affected. These two types of goods are unique products of China, which are not only related to the repayment of American debt, but also needed by the U.S. national defense industry. Therefore, the closing of the routes through Vietnam and Burma was opposed by Washington. With the signing of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the United States firmly supported Britain in opening the Burma Road in order to safeguard the common interests of both China and the United States. It is expected that American materials will be continuously imported, and Chinese raw materials will also be continuously transported to the United States, promoting trade and benefiting both sides.

Transportation Routes as Dense as Spider Webs

With the preparations of both China and Britain, transportation on the Burma Road is very convenient. There is a railway connecting Rangoon to Lashio and then to Kunming. The highway between Rangoon and Lashio runs parallel to the railway, and there are rivers that can通 to Bhamo. There is a highway from Bhamo to Kunming. There are 6,000 trucks available in China, and countless mules, horses, boats, coolies, and porters. The transportation capacity is quite sufficient.

### Another Arrest in the Attempted Assassination of Fu Xiaoan; Also Worked in Fu's Residence; Has Been Detained by the Japanese

The English-language *China Press* reports that, according to reliable sources, in connection with the assassination of Fu Xiaoan, the "Municipal Police" arrested another suspect yesterday (16th) afternoon, who is believed to be the mastermind behind the assassination. The "Municipal Police" did not acknowledge the arrest, but did not disclose the name. It was only learned that the person also worked in Fu's residence. After the suspect was arrested, he was handed over to the Japanese Army Special Service Department for interrogation. Currently, two people have been detained by the Japanese authorities in connection with the assassination attempt on Fu: one is the person arrested yesterday, and the other is a cook surnamed Chen who was detained shortly after the incident.

### Bomb Case at North Railway Station; Japanese Say Attempt to Assassinate Liang Hongzhi

At 10:10 AM the day before yesterday (16th), a grenade was suddenly discovered at ticket window number four of the North Railway Station. It did not explode at the time and was removed immediately after being discovered, so no incident occurred. It is now learned that the Japanese have paid close attention to the incident. In addition to strictly investigating the source of the bomb, it is also learned that the Japanese claimed that the first person to discover the two bombs was a Japanese guard, Taichi Mizumura, who reported it to the Japanese military police stationed there, who then devised a way to remove it. They also said that the bomb must have been intended by an assassin to assassinate Liang Hongzhi, the head of the "Supervisory Yuan," because Liang was returning to Nanjing on the 7:00 AM express train that day. At that time, the assassin must have been unable to act due to the strict security at the station, so he abandoned the bomb there.

### Chinese Guerrillas Active in the Yangtze River Basin; The Spirit of the Guerrillas is Further Enhanced Because the International Situation is Favorable to China

The English-language *China Press* reports that a foreign traveler recently returned to Shanghai from the Yangtze River basin and said that the guerrillas are becoming increasingly active in the Yangtze River basin. They heard that the Japanese are preoccupied in the south, and that Britain and the United States are now taking actions against Japan, which has further boosted their morale. The general public in the Yangtze River basin believes that the pressure from the guerrillas has made the Japanese even more difficult. The Japanese troops stationed in the Yangtze River basin are not numerous. The Japanese troops stationed in the Taihu Lake area are worried about the guerrillas west and north of Taihu Lake. The Japanese have implemented a strong economic monopoly throughout the Yangtze River basin. The people in the Yangtze River basin are living in dire conditions because the cost of living has risen to unprecedented levels.

### Siam's Bumper Harvest; No Restrictions on Shipments to Hong Kong; 250,000 Bags of Foreign Rice to Arrive in Port; But Concerns About Panic Are Not Alleviated

According to a statement issued to the Hong Kong press by Mr. Soya, the Acting Consul of Thailand (Siam) in Hong Kong, he had not heard of any restrictions on the shipment of rice to Hong Kong. Siamese rice is abundant in foreign markets (i.e., foreign countries such as Japan, the Netherlands East Indies, British Malaya, and the Straits Settlements, the Philippines, China, etc.), but this year's harvest is bumper, and even after meeting domestic needs, supply still exceeds demand, so there is no need for government control. The sudden rise and fall of rice prices in Hong Kong is due to the war, and the slight increase in shipping costs and insurance, but it is difficult to know whether the cause of the rise lies in Hong Kong or elsewhere.

Profits on Foreign Rice

The Rice Price Evaluation Committee convened a plenary committee meeting the day before yesterday and resolved that the legal profit for buying and selling foreign rice in the market should be 5% added to the production price. The principle has been formally approved by the committee and it was resolved that instructions be requested from the authorities of the two concession areas for formal implementation. In order to actively proceed, the committee sent letters to the authorities of the two concession areas yesterday. Once the instructions from the two concession areas are received, a committee meeting will be scheduled to discuss the specific measures and implement them according to the established policy. It is reported that the two authorities have expressed their support for the principle and will approve it for implementation at that time, so the city's overall food situation may gradually stabilize.

Huge Shipment to Shanghai

The English-language *China Press* reports that rice prices in this city are high, and the food situation is still quite serious. However, it was learned this (17th) morning that more than 250,000 bags of Saigon rice are expected to be shipped to Shanghai before October 28, which will improve the food situation. The above-mentioned Saigon rice will be shipped in four batches. The quantity is larger than previous shipments of rice to Shanghai. The first batch of 50,000 bags is scheduled to leave Vietnam on October 18. The subsequent batches will be shipped successively on October 22, October 26, and October 28, with 50,000 bags, 30,000 bags, and 40,000 bags each. It is also reported that the Shanghai Zengji Company (transliteration) ordered another 15,000 bags of Saigon rice on Tuesday, which is also expected to arrive soon. At the same time,

Key to High Rice Prices

Shanghai officials stated this morning that although Saigon rice is being shipped intermittently, the difficulties currently encountered in the Shanghai rice market will not be alleviated. To make the food situation more normal and lower rice prices, it is necessary to obtain more domestic rice from the areas around Shanghai. This depends on the Japanese authorities' willingness to cooperate. The concession authorities have repeatedly requested the Japanese authorities to provide assistance. It is also reported that almost all the rice produced in the occupied areas is handled by Mitsui Bussan Kaisha and shipped out of China in large quantities. Mitsui Bussan Kaisha had previously forcibly seized the egg export business, causing a large shortage of eggs in Shanghai.

Lack of Domestic Rice

The *North-China Daily News* reports that, according to sources responsible yesterday (16th), domestic rice is constantly being smuggled into Shanghai, but the quantity is very small and insufficient to meet the huge demand of the Chinese residents in the concession areas. This is one of the main reasons why foreign rice remains expensive and does not tend to fall in price. It is said that the rice situation in this city has reached a serious level. Qualified observers say that importing foreign rice to feed the 3.5 million Chinese residents in the International Settlement cannot solve the food problem, as most of these residents can only afford to buy low-priced domestic rice. The concession authorities are currently urging the Japanese army to allow the domestic rice produced in its controlled areas to be shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream. According to Chinese officials, even if the military authorities allow domestic rice to be shipped in, the issue of rice supply and distribution will still require a longer period of consideration. At the same time, the demand for domestic rice in this city is becoming increasingly urgent. An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Investigation Office stated that he has spoken with the liaison officer of the Japanese military authorities several times, and the Japanese military authorities have promised to give careful consideration to the matter of shipping in domestic rice.

### Mental Health Association to Hold Lecture Today

### Labor and Management of French Tram Company to Hold Direct Negotiations; Company Manager Made Frank Statement Yesterday; No Success in Negotiations with Intermediaries

The English-language *China Press* reports that Mr. Favre, the manager of the French Tram Company, told reporters this (17th) morning that the company's labor strike has lasted for three weeks, and he is very dissatisfied with the lack of progress in negotiations with intermediaries. Therefore, the company will attempt to negotiate directly with the strikers today in order to end the dispute. The strikers may not have been informed of the details of the negotiations. At 3:00 PM this afternoon, Favre received reporters in his office and said that the French Tram Company is seeking the assistance of newspapers to convey the company's desire to negotiate directly with the 2,500 striking workers, so that they can accurately understand the employer's attitude. It is believed that most of the strikers are unaware that negotiations are taking place.

Strict Security Still Around Company

In order to prevent serious incidents from occurring, the French police have implemented strict security around the tram depot on Rue Lupan. The intersection in front of the tram depot on Rue Lupan and Route Conty has been locked with iron nets, leaving only an entrance, and four French and Chinese police officers and one armored car are stationed there. Pedestrians and vehicles are not allowed to enter or exit. Additional police officers have also been stationed at the intersection of the tram depot on Rue Siccawei to provide protection, and patrol teams are patrolling the nearby roads.

Employer's Attitude Not Harsh

According to another report, company officials stated that they hope to resolve the labor strike as soon as possible in a spirit of goodwill and cooperation. The company is willing to negotiate directly or indirectly with the workers, as long as a reasonable solution is reached. The company is willing to make some sacrifices. The authorities refuted rumors that the company's attitude is tough and that it is dealing harshly with the workers' demands as malicious propaganda and untrue.

Mr. Chapellain Denies Mediation

Mr. Chapellain, the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday stating that he read the following news in the local news section of your newspaper on the 17th of this month: "Mr. Chapellain, the Director of the Postal Department of the General Post Office and Director of the French Municipal Council, is serving as a mediator in the labor strike of the French Tram Company." Upon investigation, since I am not a Director of the French Municipal Council, I have not participated in mediating the labor strike of the French Tram Company. The above news is likely based on inaccurate rumors. Please investigate and correct it. Respectfully, The Editorial Department of *Shen Bao*, Chapellain, October 17.

### Shengjing Returns to Export After Inspection Finds Nothing; Passengers and Cargo Once Ashore

The Shengjing, a North China liner of British Taikoo Company, loaded with cargo and passengers and sailed from Shanghai at 12:00 noon the day before yesterday (15). At 4:00 PM on the same day, the company received a secret report saying that there were bombs hidden in the cargo of the ship, and immediately telegraphed the ship to return. As reported in earlier newspapers, when the ship received the telegram, it had already left Sheshan waters. It was already 6:00 PM. The ship immediately turned around and returned to Shanghai, arriving at the port at 12:30 AM at night, and berthed at the company's No. 1 Wharf (i.e., the former New Peking Wharf) on the Bund of the French Concession. The Customs Port Police Station (i.e., the water police station) and fire boats had paid close attention beforehand. After the ship berthed, customs police immediately boarded the ship to search. Fire boats were parked nearby to stand by. The company prepared coolies to open the cargo hold and unload all the cargo ashore for temporary storage in warehouse No. 6. After the cargo was unloaded, the inspection found nothing. The original cargo was then reloaded onto the ship. The ship returned to export and sailed to Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Passengers had once landed, but then boarded the ship again with their original tickets. The general passengers were surprised when the ship returned.

Zhang Rongchu's Rong Feng Textile Company has recently been sued by Fu Company of 34 Avenue Edward VII, represented by lawyer Jiang Baoli, in the First Special Court's civil division, due to a dispute over an order for Indian cotton. The lawsuit seeks damages of 280,000 national currency. The gist of the lawsuit is that the defendant, Rong Feng Textile Company, entered into contracts with the plaintiff from January to February of this year,委托ing the plaintiff to purchase several thousand bales of Indian cotton. Because the defendant failed to make timely payments, the exchange rate fluctuations were significant, causing the plaintiff a loss of 280,000 yuan. The plaintiff requests the court to order the defendant to bear this loss. After receiving the lawsuit, the court, presided over by Judge Li, held a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff, Fu Company, through its lawyer Jiang Baoli, presented the facts and reasons for the lawsuit in detail. The defendant, Rong Feng Textile Company, represented by its lawyer, argued that the loss claimed by the plaintiff was due to the plaintiff's fault. The plaintiff failed to ship the ordered cotton quickly, causing even greater losses to the defendant. In addition to requesting the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit, the defendant also filed a counter-suit seeking damages from the plaintiff, Fu Company, for an unspecified amount. The court noted that the case required further investigation and adjourned the hearing to the 21st of this month.

### Dr. Ding Hanren Explains Symptoms of "Dengue Fever"

Reports in the newspaper recently indicated that the epidemic disease "dengue fever" is prevalent in Shanghai. Dr. Ding Hanren's description of this disease, also known as autumn epidemic, is quite detailed from a traditional Chinese medicine perspective. It is recorded below to help patients and doctors understand the true nature of this disease.

(1) Cause: A month ago, the autumn sun was still scorching hot, no less severe than midsummer, which marked the beginning of the autumn epidemic. Then came days of continuous wind and rain, with cold and dampness invading. Once contracted, the disease follows. Before the appearance of red rashes, both symptoms and blood tests may be mistaken for typhoid fever. The disease is autumn epidemic, often occurring with cold and dampness, thus resembling damp-heat epidemic and typhoid fever. However, its incubation period is very short, making it easier to contract and spread rapidly.

(2) Symptoms: Initially, chills and fever, headache, chest tightness, dry mouth, sore limbs, white and greasy tongue coating, red prickles on the tip of the tongue, and a soft and rapid pulse. After three or four days, red, itchy rashes appear on the face and limbs. The fever gradually subsides as the rashes appear, or the rashes appear as the fever weakens. The disease usually resolves in seven or eight days.

(3) Treatment: According to personal clinical statistics, over a hundred soldiers have been cured of this disease in the past month. Recently, with the widespread flooding, the spread of bacteria has intensified, and the number of patients has increased. However, the treatment process has been smooth. First, use a pungent-cooling and dispersing method to release the warm evil. This helps the red rashes to emerge easily. Then, use a heat-clearing and dampness-transforming method to eliminate residual heat. The body heat gradually subsides. If one can avoid wind-chill and control their diet, there is no need to worry about recurrence. Follow the treatment methods for exogenous warm-heat diseases of the ancient sage Ye Tianshi, and be cautious with bitter-warm and fragrant-drying medicines. This will leave no regrets.

### Case of Huge Copper Ingot Theft; Three Suspects to be Tried Together; German National Bender and White Le Suspected of Conspiracy; Two Warehouse Managers Arrested

Regarding the case of Swiss national White Le stealing a large amount of copper ingots and copper coins from the warehouse of the American Ruifeng Transfer Company, at 0:20 on the night of September 26, Yang Peisheng, deputy chief of the Central Police Station, acting on a tip, arrested two suspects, Yong natives Zhuang Zixiang and Zhou Maofa (both warehouse managers of Ruifeng), within his jurisdiction.

The police station then ordered Western officers to Bender's residence at the address, arrested him, and escorted him to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. A request was made for a postponement. Judge Fang presided over the hearing. The defendant's testimony was evasive, and he refused to provide a truthful account. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled the case to be heard together with Zhuang Zixiang and others on the 25th of this month.

### In Memory of Austrian Psychiatrist Professor Wagner-Jauregg (3) The Conqueror of General Paralysis of the Insane By Han Fen Translated by Xia Chu

In 1911, Ehrlich invented the magic bullet, bringing new hope. However, it soon became clear that the spirochetes lurking within the blood vessels of the brain remained unaffected by the new treatment.

Wagner-Jauregg endured thirty years of failure and discouragement. Finally, on June 14, 1917, he resolutely injected the blood of malaria patients into two paralytic patients, using it as an artificial fever to replace bacteria. He once said, "The treasure left on the road in 1887 was finally picked up in 1917."

Other paralytic patients followed suit and received the same injections. Wagner-Jauregg's method allowed patients already in the deadly grip of madness to recover their health, regain their human dignity, and reintegrate into society as useful individuals. Many years later, the first two paralytic patients he treated remained healthy and able to support themselves. They were resurrected from the brink of death and gained a place in history. Everyone recognizes them as relics of the medical field.

The inventor and his school worked hard for several more years to establish the new treatment method. It also took many years to explore how to eliminate physiological dangers and how to control artificial infections. New difficulties arose: "How to cultivate malaria protozoa in places without malaria?" "If this treatment is adopted, what if malaria spreads?" Wagner-Jauregg knew that these would become the headlines accusing him of "killing in the name of science."

All these questions were eventually resolved, all fears and anxieties disappeared, skeptics were silenced, and tens of millions of paralytic patients worldwide benefited from Wagner's malaria therapy. For this, he received the Nobel Prize.

However, his invention was not limited to treating general paralysis alone; its benevolent consequences extended even deeper. Wagner dreamed of preventing neurosyphilis, driving the spirochetes out of the nervous system in the early stages of syphilis, several years before the terrible general paralysis developed. This dream also came true. When used appropriately and guided properly, malaria therapy also became a preventive method.

In this way, Wagner not only gave psychiatrists a weapon, but every physician benefited from it. Their enemy—the spirochete—is lurking, waiting for the final blow. He hopes they can realize that this is the opportunity to destroy the enemy. (End)

### Nanjing Road Antique Store Robbery; Losses Amount to Hundreds of Thousands of Yuan; Female Owner and Friend Bound; Two of the Seven Robbers are Foreigners

The "Sea Captain's Shop," an antique store at 119 Nanjing Road, on the first floor of the Central Mansion, run by Tornroth, an American woman residing at 14 Rue Bourgeat, specializing in various antiques and precious items such as jade and diamonds, was suddenly broken into by seven robbers at around 8:00 PM last night. One of them was a foreigner. Two robbers were watching outside the door, and the other five drew pistols, ordering everyone to remain silent. They produced pre-prepared ropes,绑ing the store owner Tornroth and her friend Hanson, and stuffing their mouths with cotton. One robber guarded them with a gun while the other four began searching everywhere for a long time. A large number of jade antiques and other valuable items, valued at five to sixty thousand yuan, were stolen. After obtaining the loot, the robbers fled without a trace. The store immediately reported the incident to the local police station, which dispatched detectives and patrol cars to search for the robbers, but they had already escaped far away.

### Robbery of Female Guide's Jewelry

Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the Jincheng Singing Girl Agency at 8 Lane 105 Guangxi Road received a phone call from a Mr. Chen in room 6 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Xiaqing Road, requesting a female guide. The agency sent Hua Meili. After arriving at the Oriental Hotel, Hua Meili entered the room and saw three men, one in Chinese dress and one in Western dress. One of the men stood up, greeted Hua Meili, and invited her to sit down. They chatted and laughed happily. Around 11:00 PM, the three men suddenly became stern, demanding Hua Meili's ring and watch. Hua Meili refused. The three men then threatened her with knives, tied her hands and feet with ropes, and stuffed her mouth with cotton. They stole two gold rings, a watch, and several yuan in cash from her wallet, then left one after another, locking the door and fleeing without a trace. After a long time, Hua Meili managed to untie herself and reported the incident to the tea room, who then reported it to the police station.

### Sixth Charity Basketball Challenge: Shanghai Qing vs. Paramount Tomorrow Night; All Special Honorary Seats Sold Out; Mr. Songting Mao Wins First Ticket

The final act of Shanghai's highly popular charity basketball challenge, Shanghai Qing vs. Paramount, has been set for tomorrow night at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA gymnasium after Shanghai Qing confirmed that there would be no extension. Before the game, there will be two interludes: a women's performance and a Sino-Western exhibition match. In addition to the awards ceremony, which will be combined with the chrysanthemum charity sale at the Great China Swimming Pool on the 24th of this month, a closing ceremony and ball auction will be held tomorrow night, presided over by Mr. Yuan. The Nanyang Middle School band will also perform on site. All ten special honorary seats were sold out after the bidding continued yesterday afternoon. Details and the order of events for tomorrow night are listed below.

Tomorrow Night's Order

Youyou Jingwu (Women's Performance) 7:30 PM

Giant vs. Paramount B (Sino-Western Match) 8:10 PM

Shanghai Qing vs. Paramount (Challenge Match) 9:00 PM

Bidding for Tickets

The bidding for the tenth special honorary seat continued yesterday afternoon, with two sides showing a three-way trend, making it impossible to produce a winner for a while. Mr. Yuan, along with his secretaries Cheng Zhiliang and Chen Shengyuan, personally received the bids. From 11:00 AM, the two phones in Mr. Yuan's office rang non-stop, making it difficult to handle all the calls. Soon, Mr. Songting Mao, the eldest son of local industrialist Mao Heqing, initially bid 130 yuan. At the same time, Zhou Junhua and his brother Junli also bid 220 yuan and 210 yuan, respectively, for the first and third tickets. Thus, Mrs. Li's standard price of 200 yuan was broken. After Mr. Yuan电询ed Mrs. Li, she expressed her willingness to increase her bid to take the lead. However, Mrs. Li was very modest, as the Zhou brothers were the younger brothers of Zhou Junxian. During the charity ball auction last week, Mrs. Li outbid Zhou's 1,000 yuan with a top bid of 1,100 yuan. Therefore, she decided to concede the first honorary ticket to the Zhou brothers, allowing them to take the lead. However, Mrs. Li was happy to contribute and expressed her willingness to spend 350 yuan to buy all the honorary tickets from the fourth to the tenth. The benevolent and righteous actions of the Mao, Zhou, and Li families are truly admirable. It is also heard that although this decision by Li Hengzhai was made by his mother, he is scheduled to return to Shanghai today and will participate in the charity ball auction tomorrow night. At the same time, industrialist Zhou Junxian has expressed his decision to join the bidding group.

Ticket Sales Locations

The news reported yesterday about the twelve Chinese and foreign celebrities signing the tickets contained some inaccuracies. The four foreign celebrities, including Inspector-General Ke Zijie of the Public Works Department, Superintendent Philippe, British Consul George, and Captain Little, will be invited by Nanyang Middle School to attend the chrysanthemum charity sale held at the school, not to sign the tickets. However, the eight Chinese celebrities who have decided to sign the tickets will indeed sign them as a souvenir. As for the 10-yuan honorary tickets and the 5-yuan regular tickets, the number is still limited to 800 seats. Since the sales began, more than half have been sold. However, yesterday a large number of fans went to Nanyang Middle School to inquire about alternative sales locations, as it has been a long time and some may have forgotten. Therefore, we are reprinting the list of locations: 1. Shen Bao Office, 2. Xinwen Bao Office, 3. YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, 4. China Amusement Company at the racecourse, 5. Hua Dong Sporting Goods Company, 6. Xie He Sporting Goods Company at 1000 Avenue Edward VII, 7. World Book Company, 8. China Book Company, 9. Commercial Press, 10. Tongyi Middle School at Rue Marigney and Avenue Foch, 11. Heming Shoe Store, including the main store at Eight Immortals Bridge, the first branch on Nanjing Road, and the second branch at Heming in the Paramount Bazaar in Jing'an Temple.

### Ministry of Education Improves Secondary Education; Provinces Should Establish Advanced Training Classes for Senior and Junior High School Teachers; Measures and Key Points Promulgated to Provinces for Compliance

(Chongqing News Agency) Article 13 and 14 of the regulations for Normal Colleges already stipulated that Normal Colleges could set up advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers. The Ministry of Education has now decided that secondary education in the rear provinces urgently needs improvement, and advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers should be actively prepared. The Ministry proposed a resolution from the Second Senior Normal Education Conference, with the key points of the measures for advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers as follows: (1) Provinces and cities should continue to conduct qualification examinations for secondary school teachers in accordance with the Ministry's orders. (2) Provinces and cities should give priority to recommending senior and junior high school or equivalent school teachers with more than two years of teaching experience who have failed the examination to advanced training classes in various Normal Colleges, providing them with more than one year of professional training (which can be completed in stages). (3) Students in advanced training classes for senior and junior high schools should not only make up for specialized subjects, but also study basic education subjects and research on subject-specific teaching materials. (4) Students in advanced training classes for senior and junior high schools should be exempt from tuition and board fees. (5) Funding for advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers should be raised by the education departments of each province and city, and the Ministry of Education may provide subsidies as appropriate. Each class should raise at least 20,000 yuan. (6) Students in advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers who pass the examination and are confirmed by the Ministry of Education will be given a certificate of advanced training for teachers in certain subjects in senior and junior high schools and equivalent schools by the Normal College. This certificate is equivalent to a certificate of qualification for senior and junior high school teachers. (7) Students in advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers should return to their original schools to teach as a general principle after completing their training and passing the examination. Those with excellent results should be given preferential treatment by the educational administrative agencies of the province and city. (8) Separate regulations will be issued for individual advanced training programs for senior and junior high school teachers.

### Finance Foreign Exchange Experiences Another Surge

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed rates remain unchanged. The unofficial rates for British and American currency weakened slightly, but initially, speculators still entered the market, briefly causing prices to loosen. The US dollar reached 5.9875. However, in the afternoon, operators, buoyed by positive news, aggressively bought, leading to a tightening trend. As a result, British gold closed at 3-bent 76.5625, and the US dollar at 5.78125, down 0.046875 and 0.0625 respectively, compared to the previous day. The futures trend mirrored the spot market.

Foreign Firms Also Conclude Transactions

In the early morning, the London cable rate for the near term fell by 0.0625, while the forward rate remained stable. The New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London gold spot price was fixed. The exchange rate between the British and American currencies was unchanged, while the rate against Shanghai was also stable. The US dollar rose two and a half against the British pound, one cent against Shanghai, and there was no market for the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained as before. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3-bent 81.25 for British gold and 5.84375 for the US dollar, unchanged from the previous day's closing prices. After the opening, Chinese speculators sold off, making the market quite firm, with Datong Bank and an American bank selling US dollars for this month at 5.875. Later, due to some buying interest from Chinese banks, the trend stabilized slightly, with Chinese banks and speculators buying US dollars for this month at 5.84375. At that time, foreign firms also came to settle transactions, buying US dollars for October delivery at 5.84375. HSBC's listed rates were announced and remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced, down 0.25 percent. At this point, the spot US dollar weakened to 5.8125, but soon speculators continued to sell, and the market returned to equilibrium. Speculators sold East Asian US dollars for this month at 5.84375. Later, speculators tried to buy at this price but were unsuccessful, so the closing condition remained weak, with British gold at 3-bent 79.6875 and the US dollar at 5.8125, up 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively, compared to the morning opening.

British and American Currencies Both Tighten

The post-market trend remained tight. Speculators first bought US dollars for this month at 5.8125. The Beneficial Bank bought British gold for this month at 3-bent 78.125. Furthermore, HSBC also absorbed US dollars for this month at 5.78125 from the American Datong Bank. The evening closing price was 3-bent 76.5625 for British gold and 5.78125 for the US dollar for this month, the same as the spot price. British gold for November was 3-bent 75, and the US dollar was 5.75, down 0.046875 for both spot and futures British gold, and up 0.0652 for the US dollar, compared to the previous day's closing.

Hong Kong US Dollar Eases

Hong Kong, 17th (Thursday) - The foreign exchange market opened steady this morning, with no changes in British, American, and Japanese currencies. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot fell by one yuan to 391 yuan. At 11:30, it was stable. The spot US dollar strengthened by 0.0625 to 23 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot rose by one yuan to 392 yuan, with other rates unchanged. At 11:55, it was stable. The spot US dollar continued to ease by 0.0625 to 23.0625 yuan.

The unofficial rate for "Joint Currency" rebounded by 1.5 yuan to 79.25 yuan.

### Short Squeeze Trend Expands - Gold Market Uptrend Revives

Yesterday, the spot gold market in Shanghai suddenly surged, with prices soaring past the 5,700 yuan mark. The main reason was the expansion of the short squeeze trend and the dramatic tightening of foreign exchange, which stimulated sentiment in all quarters. In the morning, most players with substantial capital were still hesitant to engage in long positions. Although some banks and money shops were eager to cover their short positions, securities firms and gold dealers were also actively selling. As a result, the market opened at 5,670 yuan and fluctuated between 5,645 yuan and 5,680 yuan without significant movement. In the afternoon, rumors of favorable news and the sudden tightening of foreign exchange spurred banks to continue covering their short positions as before. Securities firms further increased their long positions, and retail investors also engaged in long positions, causing prices to leap upward to 5,775 yuan. Eventually, many profit-taking retail investors sold off, causing a slight pullback, and the market closed at 5,738 yuan, up 98 yuan. Trading volume was not strong, totaling 4,000 taels. Gold ornaments rose 10 yuan, reaching 590 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Squeezed by Nearly 100 Yuan

Although the foreign exchange market was calm in the early morning, there were only buyers and no sellers in the market, pushing up the opening price by several tens of yuan. A money shop bought ten taels from a gold dealer for 5,670 yuan. Before long, as the foreign exchange market reported strengthening, gold dealers and securities firms came to sell, which immediately caused a setback. A bank sold 20 taels to a money shop for 5,645 yuan. However, at this time, a certain gold dealer and money shop were very eager to buy, aggressively purchasing several tens of taels, which pushed the price back up. A bank bought 20 taels from a gold dealer for 5,680 yuan. Then, under the dumping pressure from securities firms and banks, the price moved downward again. A bank sold 20 taels to a gold dealer for 5,645 yuan. However, near noon, due to the weakening of foreign exchange, sellers decreased, and the situation turned upward again. A bank traded 20 taels for 5,680 yuan. At the close, a gold dealer sold ten taels to a bank for 5,675 yuan, and after the close, the asking price was 5,690 yuan. In the afternoon, at the opening, a bank first bought 20 taels from a gold dealer for 5,690 yuan. At this time, bank groups were buying, and foreign exchange was also tightening, immediately pushing the price past the 5,700 yuan mark. A bank bought 20 taels from a gold dealer for 5,740 yuan. Later, the gold dealer sold off slightly, slightly suppressing the price by several tens of yuan. A money shop sold ten taels to a gold dealer for 5,690 yuan. However, banks and securities firms jointly aggressively bought, causing the price to jump sharply. A securities firm bought 20 taels from a money shop, and the price had already risen to 5,775 yuan. Unexpectedly, gold dealers and banks seized the opportunity to sell heavily, causing another fall back to 5,730 yuan. However, in the evening close, a securities firm bought 20 taels from a gold dealer, and the price had recovered to 5,738 yuan, up 98 yuan compared to the previous day. The total fluctuation for the day was 130 yuan. The selling price of spot gold from the gold shops was several tens of yuan higher than spot gold, and the buying price was more than 30 yuan lower. The spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there were hardly any trades.

Gold Ornaments Also Increase by 10 Yuan

The selling price of gold ornaments per tael in jewelry stores did not change initially, but at 2:30 PM, it increased by ten yuan. As a result, Da Tong Heng suspended the price at 690 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng's price was similar to the previous price, with the buying price about 30 yuan lower.

### Spot Gold Lacks Chips - Focus on Futures Trading

The unofficial spot gold market, under special circumstances, once reached its peak. Operators and those engaged in buying and selling sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. However, this type of trading was limited to spot gold. Although there were also buying long and selling short, there were always actual goods prepared. In the past, delivery was sufficient. However, due to the abundance of floating capital in this city, wealthy individuals and general merchants all bought gold for storage, and even secretly bought in huge amounts. The current chips have already become scarce, and delivery among peers has proven ineffective. Therefore, recent trading has been extremely scarce, and the fluctuations have expanded considerably. It is heard that the market authorities will reform and plan to focus solely on futures trading, with settlement based on the closing price upon expiration. (Hao)

### US Dollar Rises Again

Yesterday, in the foreign currency market, the spot gold price suddenly surged, and British and American gold pounds also rose by two yuan each. British gold notes remained mostly unchanged. US dollar notes initially retreated to 16.48 yuan, then gradually rose. In the afternoon, the upward trend was strong, once rising to 16.85 yuan. There were also rumors that commercial activities between Japanese and American foreign firms would temporarily cease tonight, but the final price was 16.78 yuan, up 20 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose slightly by one cent. The upward trend of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes was even stronger, with the former rising to 1.4 yuan and the latter to 1.37 yuan.

### Food - Large Batch of Foreign Rice Arrives

Foreign rice is arriving continuously, and the market continues to soften. A batch of 7,500 tons will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, and overseas prices are also being lowered due to favorable exchange rates and cheap production. Yesterday, Jin Fa continued to sell 300 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice at 77.8 yuan, and 500 tons of No. 2 at 73.6 yuan. Jian Yuan sold 1,000 tons at 74 yuan. Under the continuous orders of foreign rice, although actual sales and customer stockpiling are absorbing the supply due to the low prices, the market is ultimately difficult to support. As a result, the price of each type of foreign rice fell slightly by two or three cents in the morning and then continued to fall by half a yuan in the afternoon. Trading volume was light, with less than 5,000 bags traded for the entire day. The later trend remained weak and sluggish.

### Flour and Wheat Still Show Little Progress

There is still little progress in the flour market. Because the customer groups have no actual needs, only the local street market has actual sales, and the quantity is not significant. Because the supply from various factories is limited, it is ultimately impossible to supply universally. Therefore, various flour mills are using foreign flour as a substitute. Yesterday, it was heard that more than 1,000 bags of Pao Tai brand and San Jiao brand foreign flour were traded in the local street market, with prices ranging from 19 yuan to 18.85 yuan. Because orders are due to arrive, sentiment is quite firm. The old Che Pai brand returned goods, even as a special local sales product, has rebounded to 19.1 yuan due to the depletion of supplies. It is heard that there were also two to three hundred bags traded in the local street market, and the market is as firm as usual.

The wheat market is still showing little development. Because domestic and foreign sources are both difficult to unblock, and the goods arriving are scarce, sellers are unusually aggressive. However, although Japanese factories are willing to take action, they are unwilling to lower their prices. Chinese factories are unable to purchase them for the time being due to the difficulty of transporting them into the concession. It is heard that the asking price in the market is still 27 yuan to 25 yuan, and even if there is a transaction, it is only a sporadic embellishment of one or two hundred bags.

### Securities - Foreign Stocks Reappear Prosperous - Domestic Debt Turns Dull

The securities market was increasingly sluggish yesterday. There were a few trades in the morning, but only types A and C saw any activity in the afternoon, while the rest were ignored. The atmosphere in the market was quiet. Trading was relatively more frequent yesterday morning, and market prices remained unchanged. Only No. 24 was slightly sold, and Heng Fu was slightly bought. Trading declined even further in the afternoon. One Type A stock traded at a market price of 5,000, and one Type C stock traded at a market price of 30,000 to 40,000. The rest were completely ignored. As a result, market prices saw highs and lows of only five cents and one dime. The total turnover was approximately 300,000 yuan. A brief and clear table is listed below.

For stock transactions, 100 shares of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of 7 yuan. The opening of the Nichi Zhong Industry stock market was stable. Although rumors were still rampant, they had been widely ignored. The market situation turned firmer in the afternoon, and the prosperous image of the past reappeared. Confidence seemed to be completely restored. If the situation does not change, the market should be able to make further progress. Jardine Matheson's shares rose sharply, and the shares of various Dutch East Indies rubber companies also increased significantly.

London, 16th (Wednesday) - Today, the listed prices of Chinese government bonds and Far East British companies' shares remain flat, and the market conditions are generally unchanged. The British Shanghai Bank, managed by the foreign firm, has set its second interim dividend for 1940 on November 8th, at one yuan per share (national currency).

The Bertam Consolidated Rubber Company, managed by the Huifeng Foreign Firm, has set its interim dividend for 1940 on October 31st, at ten cents per share (national currency).

### Yarn and Cotton - Yarn and Cloth Markets Fluctuate - Resale Prices Rise and Fall Indeterminately

The cotton yarn market, which fell the previous day, rebounded again today, exhibiting a "yarn malaria" phenomenon, rising and falling suddenly, which is very difficult to grasp. This is partly due to the fact that speculators enter and exit from time to time. When chips are tight, it rises rapidly, and when they are released, it falls. From this perspective, the yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation, but actual sales remain sluggish.

At the start of the current yarn market, morale turned weak, but there were still those in the market who dragged in small orders, so the first market showed another increase. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,225 yuan, which soon rose to 1,229 yuan. Then, as long positions were settled and scalpers sold off, it fell again, hovering at 1,218 yuan to 1,219 yuan. Suddenly, it fell to 1,210 yuan. When the low price appeared, long positions became very active. New buyers believed that the downward trend had passed and that it could turn to a good side. So everyone pulled each other, dragging each other in, rising straight to 1,248 yuan. Unexpectedly, it lost ten yuan in an instant, and the closing price was 1,244 yuan. It is estimated that 5,500 bales were traded in half a day. The amount of purchases made by each industry association is recorded below:

Hong Kong 290, Fellow Traders 5,100, Statistics 500

### Cotton Yarn Outside Speculation - Ultimately More Losses Than Gains

In the past week, the cotton yarn market in the isolated island has been particularly lively, with people whispering, shouting, and arguing. The betting with money in hand shows each person's vision and displays their skills. The cutthroat market is as fast as lightning, fluctuating up and down, making it impossible to grasp. Buying low and selling high can be said to be the consensus of all people. The only difference lies in the sensitivity and slowness of perception. The sensitive ones take precedence, and the slow ones lag behind. Therefore, the sensitive "earn" and the slow "lose." But occasionally, there are also opposites, the sensitive "lose" and the slow "earn," although it is said that the visions are different, but it is also based on the fortune. Observing the situation in the yarn market, there are more "outside" speculators and fewer "insider" speculators. Some of the outsiders who are accustomed to speculating in foreign exchange, foreign currencies, gold, or rice, wheat, and flour are feeling tired, so they are attracted to the "cotton yarn speculation" to change their taste. As for the insiders, because they have suffered in futures yarn, in this autumn of ever-changing international situation, it is better to be down-to-earth, do factory orders (spot), or act as an agent for customers, or buy in themselves, and do as much business as they have the financial capacity to do, and secure a solid foundation. Outsiders are mostly blindly following, so there are more losses than gains, and there are few who are not overwhelmed by the waves. On the morning of the 9th of this month (last Wednesday), the writer, on behalf of a certain gentleman from a customer in Bengbu (a large grain merchant), placed a double horse futures yarn order for ten bales at a certain yarn number, with the price being 1,174 yuan at the market midpoint, and a deposit of 1,500 yuan was paid. After the order was placed, it once bounced back to 50 or 60 yuan. The customer seemed impatient. I advised him that since he had already bought it, he should rest assured and see what would happen on the 14th and 15th (after Sunday), when it would surely show its edge. Sure enough, on the morning of the 14th, the opening price reached about 1,190 yuan. Unexpectedly, the customer was an amateur and was too anxious, instructing me to sell when it reached 80 yuan, which can be said to be extremely foolish. But it is difficult for an amateur to be first, and the insiders always take precedence. The best thing that the outsiders can do is to get a share of the remaining profit. Safe friends, it is better to speculate less. (Zhao)

### Large Batch of Indian Cotton Arrives at Port and is Unloaded

The current cotton situation is still firm. Everyone believes that inventory is trending weak, so they are hoping for the best. According to cotton merchants, the amount of Indian cotton ordered from overseas by telegram in the past two days has been huge, and it can arrive in Shanghai in three weeks, with a profit of 30 to 40 yuan per dan, so some people are risking buying it.

Another message states that the price of foreign cotton cloth and the New York cotton market initially showed firmness. Later, due to the purchases of speculators and the influence of high Wall Street stock prices, the closing price was 3 to 5 points higher than the previous day. The Indian market was quiet. Yesterday, the forecast rose by half a rupee.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, the buying intentions from all parties were quite strong. Fellow traders who had goods on hand were unwilling to sell them, so there were not many transactions. Fellow traders generally continued to be bullish on raw cotton.

A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the British company's Elifura (transliteration) ship arrived from Mumbai, carrying 8,400 tons of cotton, which is equivalent to more than 25,200 pieces, and docked at Pudong Qichang Wharf for unloading.

### Miscellaneous Grains - Soybeans Turn Steady

Yesterday's soybean market, because Tianjin beans were arriving at the same time (with 10,000 packages on the way), some cargo owners dumped prices to sell, resulting in a tired market atmosphere and a small shake. After that, exporters from Hong Kong and Guangdong purchased 1,000 packages of Qingdao beans, so the weary wind stopped, and the overall situation was stabilized. The broad bean sales market is usually only busy for a certain period, so the current Qing and Bai beans are inevitably split. The route of Qingpi is only moving slightly in the local street, and development is inevitably weak. Baimi's northbound transportation by Japanese merchants is still lively, so the momentum is quite optimistic. Yesterday, Shangjin merchants purchased 1,500 to 1,600 packages of eggplant peel silkworm (price details in the market price column), and the local street inquired about various Qingpi silkworms more than 500 packages. Except for the firmness of high-quality goods, the rest were as flat and tired as before.

Yesterday (17th), there were also 5,510 packages of soybeans transported from Tianjin.

### Sugar Market - Dutch Raw Sugar Opens at 7,000 Packages

Yesterday, the sugar market benefited from foreign exchange, and fatigue reappeared. The guild's market price was: current spot for No. 24 coarse white, 75 yuan, a small five cents for local merchants, 74.7 yuan, a small three cents for foreign merchants, and 59 yuan, a small half yuan for re-exported goods. Dutch raw sugar current spot was 57 yuan to 56.87 yuan, a small seven cents, and road goods were 56.6 yuan, and Tianxiang Foreign Firm opened 7,000 packages at a price of US$2.5, OIF example. Taikoo Car White B mark was 73 yuan, a small five cents for the West warehouse, and 72.5 yuan, also a small five cents for the East warehouse. DY mark was 69.8 yuan for the West warehouse, and HX mark was 68.9 yuan, a small two and three cents for the East warehouse.

### North-South Goods - Cangzhou Red Dates Offer New Products - Sichuan Fungus Rises Sharply

The first batch of new Cangzhou red dates has arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, 138 packages were opened, with a price of 75 yuan, which is almost double the market price of the previous old goods.

Sichuan fungus, recently, has become scarce, and the market situation is frequently tight. It used to be priced at 500 yuan, but now it has been raised to 540 yuan for those that are unopened. Yesterday, it was priced at 560 yuan.

### Oil Cakes - Raw Oil Falls Again by Two or Three Yuan - Soybean Oil Market Also Drops

Yesterday, the grain and oil market saw a sharp decline. The current spot price of raw oil fell again by two or three yuan. It is estimated that dozens of barrels of Jiaozhou raw oil opened at a price of 72.5 yuan to 74 yuan. As for the soybean oil market, because the market inventory is abundant, it is only controlled by a small number of people, and the market has become a falsely tight situation. Once there is pressure, the market will not be able to support it. The price of Dayou Factory oil opened at 85 yuan. Yesterday (17th), there were also 2,980 cans and 350 pieces of raw oil, and 500 pieces of soybean oil, all transported from Qingdao.

### Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Speculation is Active - Selling Prices Rise and Fall Indeterminately

Domestic Cloth - Yesterday, the cloth market fluctuated, falling in the morning and rebounding in the afternoon. This is because there is speculation in the market at present. In actual trading, the price rises and then there are releases. When it is low, there are also draggings. Therefore, the selling price changes rapidly in an instant. In the morning market, fine cloth and twill each fell by two and a half to five cents per piece. Near noon, it rebounded by about five cents. The opening prices of coarse cloth and bleached cloth remained unchanged. Stockpilers were active, and in the afternoon, they were even more prosperous. The local street traded more than 1,000 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, and grey fabrics such as poplin and satin, and printed goods. Actual sales were still flat. Guangdong and Hong Kong buyers purchased more than 300 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Yantai buyers purchased nearly 200 yuan of heavyweight coarse cloth.

East Cloth - It was flat first and then rose, and the situation was very firm. The 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 37.67 yuan in the morning. Then, because the fellow traders and stockpilers had a strong appetite, the market atmosphere turned tight, and the asking price frequently increased. The closing price of the Dragon Head fine cloth rose to 38.15 yuan per piece. The Four Gentlemen's serge was 1.1575 yuan per yard.

### Woolen Fabrics and Clothing Steadily Rising - Sales are More Prosperous Than Before

Since more people are wearing suits, the sales of woolen, cotton, and knitted fabrics have expanded accordingly. Whether it is for men or women, it is more than before the war. Because prices have risen sharply, Shanghai-woven woolen fabrics have become popular and occupy the most advantageous position in the current woolen fabric market. Furthermore, judging from the business of clothing stores on various roads, the most prosperous are the luggage tailors on Daxin Street and in the inner streets. The business of clothing stores on Xiafei Road, Sichuan Road, and Nanjing Road has decreased compared to the spring. High-end buyers are turning to mid-range, and mid-range buyers are turning to low-end, mostly because they feel that they lack the financial resources to make new clothes.

### Hardware - Flat Folded Iron Sales Are Active

Flat folded iron sales have been severely hit since the Changjiang gang stopped doing business. In the past, both because can manufacturers, toy factories, cigarette factories, and machine factories in the local street have slightly adopted it, the market has slightly improved. However, because transactions are not widespread, the market price remains stable at the old price, such as 150 yuan per 200 pounds (equivalent to two bundles) for selected goods, and 130 yuan for each case of patterned goods. It is estimated that the actual sales in the market yesterday were approximately 100 cases.

### Blue Lead is Flat - Iron Billets Gradually Rise

The blue lead market is not showing how high or low it is because the supply is insufficient and the transactions are also light. It is estimated that the foreign merchant group showed some intention to enter yesterday, and it is heard that the asking price is still around 110 yuan.

The iron billet market saw several tens of bundles absorbed by thermos factories in the past two days. In addition, iron printing factories and billet manufacturers also occasionally searched for entry, so the market is not lonely, and sentiment is excellent because of this. The market price is gradually rising. It is estimated that the transaction price in the market yesterday has reached 1,100 yuan per bundle, and the asking price of fellow traders is still 1,150 yuan to 1,200 yuan.

### Silk and Tea - Silk Exports Still Shrinking

Yesterday, the silk market suddenly took a turn for the worse, with the American market showing even more weakness. New York spot prices fell five points, a drop of one dime and four cents from the previous two days, while forward prices fell three and a half points, a drop of one dime and one cent from the previous day. Yokohama was closed yesterday for a holiday, so there was no market. However, the buying interest of foreign firms in this port has weakened. Currently, the cost of transporting Wuxi raw silk to Shanghai is around 600 yuan per bale, plus a special tax of 110 yuan, making the burden not light. Therefore, prices in Shanghai are holding firm, and no transactions were reported yesterday.

### In Front of the Pawnshop

— Shui Rong

Have you ever seen a dignified seven-foot man shed tears?

I have. Just today. He stood like a log inside the doorway of a pawnshop, clutching a pawn ticket in his hand, large teardrops falling down his gaunt face. Falling.

Behind him was that terrifyingly large character for "pawn."

(Was it the exploitation of the exceedingly shrewd shop assistant? Was it that the price of the pawn could not buy a measure of rice? Was it the cold, with thin clothes, and no ability to redeem a lined jacket, a cotton coat?)

The gaunt face and the shoulder blades hidden beneath the blue cloth short shirt were twitching, twitching.

But I could not hear his crying. I could not tell whether it was because he was only sobbing, or because it was swallowed up by the city's noise.

On the street, buses roared. Cars honked. Rickshaws jostled. People also jostled. This formed a river of life. Flowing, flowing. Everyone struggled: pushing people, being pushed, everyone fearing falling behind, fearing becoming dregs.

Many people ran past that pawnshop door, that worker. Running past without a glance.

Everyone appeared so hurried, self-absorbed; without sympathy, without mutual aid!

"Brother, what's wrong?" My lips were moving, I wanted to shout that to him.

But suddenly, a dirty body bumped into me full on, and slipped away. Following closely were the sounds of leather boots and the whistling of a leather whip!

I was startled and ran away.

### Promoting Cremation

— Zhao Ji

According to reports: "Since the formation of the isolated island in this port, the population density has increased, and the number of corpses and coffins has also increased compared to before. According to the Municipal Council's statistics, the number of deaths in Shanghai has also increased due to population crowding. Last month, the number of corpses cremated totaled 2,287, while the number of coffins sent reached 39,107."

Regardless of whether we consider the cremated corpses or the coffined corpses, the combined total was so large last month, but this is a fact: there were 39,107 coffined corpses, and 2,287 cremated corpses; the coffined corpses accounted for the majority. But we cannot ignore that there were also 2,287 cremated corpses.

In our society with its customs and habits, if a person dies and is to be "cremated," this can truly be said to be a major event. When a monk passes away, sitting in a large vat to be cremated, it is treated as an interesting event to rush to watch the spectacle; but if someone asks him if it would be good to be cremated when he dies, then he would strongly oppose it, "I am not a monk." If elderly people's descendants want to cremate them, that is even seen as great rebellion and unfilial piety. In fact, is this not superstition at work, believing that people still have a "soul" after death? Human awareness is because of the "soul," so even though the physical body is stiff and cold, if it is to be cremated, it is very painful. As for monks who are cremated after passing away, that is because they have completed their cultivation and ascended to heaven.

In fact, there were originally no coffins in ancient times, and if people died, they were abandoned in ravines. It was not until the time of Yu that "tile coffins" were used, and during the Xia Dynasty, "堲周" were used, but they were all made of earth and not wood. It was not until the Yin Dynasty that wooden coffins began to be used. It can be seen that using coffins to hold corpses was not originally a big deal; it was just that later generations played around in order to "preserve corpses well." However, can "corpses" ultimately be preserved well? Won't they still rot after a certain amount of time? So I say: when people die, that's it, setting a fire to burn them is the most straightforward thing to do. I often tell my friends: there are three dramas to be performed in a person's life. When you are born, you celebrate the "full month," your parents carry you in and out for people to admire. When you reach adulthood and get married, that is even a "great comedy." Until you die of old age, they still want to play with you for a while. Now there are funeral homes, so they dress you up as if you were still alive. I always feel that this is a drama, but it is a "tragedy."

In fact, "cremation" is not a recent "invention." It was already very "popular" during the Song Dynasty. This is a historically verifiable fact that no one can deny. In addition to being straightforward, cremation also has a benefit: it can reduce the amount of farmland occupied by the "dead." In the farmlands of us Chinese people, there are mounds and mounds, all over the province are mounds of graves. If another five hundred or a thousand years pass, wouldn't the farmlands be entirely occupied by the "dead"? Therefore, cremation can free up a lot of arable land for increased production.

Last month's cremation numbers were as high as 2,287, and I think it was because Shanghai was formed into an isolated island, a matter of necessity! But I want to suggest to everyone (who would be willing to accept this suggestion?): promote cremation. In addition to being straightforward and reducing the amount of farmland occupied by the "dead," there is also the fact that burning corpses feels much more "hygienic." Currently, everything is expensive, and coffins cannot be an exception. Even if poor people want to die, they "cannot afford to die," so cremation can save money and really avoids being buried in shoddy coffins, giving the living people a threat of infection.

I advocate cremation, and Shanghai should have a special "funeral home" for cremation (I don't know if this name is appropriate).

Hawthorne Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 9 - The Chauffeur's News

When I parked in front of number 27 Qingpu Road, I saw a thin man dressed in black standing at the corner of Datong Road. As soon as this man saw me get out of the car, he slowly walked away, looking rather suspicious. This person seemed to be a detective sent to monitor the place, but I did not recognize him. I did not worry about it and pushed open the iron gate with the floral pattern and walked in. The iron gate was ajar. I pushed the gate open very gently. When I walked inside, I did not see anyone. The yellow gauze curtains in the reception room were tightly drawn, and it was quiet without a sound. I first took a look at Old Mao's gatehouse on the right-hand side, but the door was closed. I went directly to the entrance of the gatehouse and tapped on the door twice with my finger, but there was no response. I turned the doorknob, and it was also ajar and not locked. Old Mao was not inside, but his dirty old yellow leather shoes were left under a small square table. I walked in and picked up a leather shoe and looked at it. There was indeed a hole in the sole. I took out a soft ruler from my pocket and measured it. It was indeed eleven inches and six.

This discovery could not help but make me feel delighted. So this Old Mao was also involved! But just as I put the leather shoe back in its place and turned around to leave the gatehouse, I suddenly saw the gray-haired Old Mao standing outside the door, his small, round rat-like eyes staring at me in shock. He had already changed into a pair of black serge cloth-topped shoes. Then he opened his toothless lips and spoke to me.

"Sir, you—you—" He clearly wanted to ask what I was doing in his room, but he did not dare to ask directly because he was concerned about something.

I replied, "Old Mao, I've come to find you."

"Find me? What's the matter?"

I felt it was difficult to answer. Of course, I did not want to tell him the story of examining his leather shoes. I vaguely said, "What are you doing inside?"

Old Mao waited a moment and replied, "I was answering the phone. A Miss Bao Yu called, and a Miss Wang was playing mahjong—this Miss Bao is also a good friend of Miss Wang, and she doesn't know that Miss Wang has been beaten to death. I told her this information, and she said she would come here immediately." He paused, looked at me, and seemed to feel that I was not paying much attention to his report, so he brought up his previous question again. "Sir, what do you want from me?"

I casually replied, "I want you to go and inform your Old Master Li, and ask him to come downstairs and talk to me for a few words."

Old Mao's rat-like eyes were still fixed on my face, as if he felt that my answer was just made up on the spot. He clearly suspected that I had some purpose in walking into his gatehouse. He shook his head and said, "Sir, you want to see Old Master Li? He is not upstairs." (139)

### Public Notice to Society Regarding the Current Epidemic

— Zhang Juying

Dengue fever was first discovered and became prevalent in Java and other places in 1790. Later, it became rampant in the tropics. Forty years ago, there was a severe epidemic in Shantou, Chaozhou, Xiamen, and other places in China. It often affects coastal areas, spreading rapidly and widely, becoming a major menace of epidemics. The disease is transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito. The description of the rising and falling nature of the fever is very detailed. Initially, it manifests as chills and fever, the prodromal febrile phase. During this phase, the fever gradually rises, reaching its peak on the third or fourth day, followed by sweating, diarrhea, and intermittent fever. The patient feels weak. After the high fever subsides, they feel slightly better; this is the so-called intermittent phase, or afebrile phase. It can last from twelve hours to three days, varying in duration. Then, the fever returns, even higher than before, entering the terminal febrile phase, also known as the secondary febrile phase. During this phase, pain symptoms become more pronounced, possibly even more severe than before. As for the rash, the face initially turns red and flushed, with apparent congestive spots on the facial skin (sometimes only blood-colored marks are visible); this is the so-called initial rash. Then, most rashes appear (sometimes appearing during the intermittent phase); this is the so-called late rash. This rash has no fixed appearance; it may resemble a maculopapular rash, or resemble measles, or be scattered and similar to scarlet fever, or resemble papules, or flat lichen. Mostly, it resembles measles.

The above is the standard disease pattern of dengue fever. Apart from this, there are cases that do not conform to the above standard, but are indeed this disease: firstly, no initial rash appears; secondly, some may not have a very high body temperature. Furthermore, this disease rarely has complications, but children may have seizures, or the fever may return after two weeks, or the condition may worsen due to misdiagnosis.

This is not a domestic disease, but an imported one. However, many Western doctors also overlook it, failing to pay attention, or misdiagnosing it as typhoid fever due to the decrease in white blood cells. However, the high fever with slow pulse, the absence of the Widal reaction in blood tests, and the intermittent nature of the fever pattern then reveal that it is not typhoid fever. Or, it may be suspected to be measles, but there is no catarrh of the nose and no Koplik's spots, and the rash first appears on the face, so it is also not measles. Or, it may be scarlet fever, but scarlet fever has a fast pulse, pharyngitis, and an increase in white blood cells, which is also very different. If Western doctors, when diagnosing Western diseases, still seem doubtful and unable to diagnose, how can the doctors in the market, who live in a drunken dream and make a living selling fermented soybeans and bean curd rolls, treat it? I am not boasting about my discovery, but specifically informing people in society that the disease is not a serious condition, so they should not be like blind men riding blind horses, carelessly taking medicine. I hope that a disease that starts peacefully and pleasantly will remain peaceful and pleasant to the end. (End)

Entertainment World

### Shirley Temple's Playroom

— Yi

After Shirley Temple left the film industry, there has been some harsh criticism from the outside world regarding her family's finances. It is said to be a rumor that the playroom built adjacent to her home is a museum, ready to be opened to the public for a fee. But in fact, this is not the case. The house was built to store Shirley's toys, hundreds of dolls, and gifts from fans. All of Shirley's parties will now be held here. Perhaps the above misunderstanding arose because her doll room is open to the public twice a year. However, in the future, two charity fundraising events will be held in this room each year: one for the "Motion Picture Relief Fund" and the other for the Children's Hospital.

### A First Play After Recovering from Illness

— Xu Muyun

I have been hospitalized for treatment for illness for four months and have not held a pen during this time. Going to the theater to see a play at Huang Yulin's place was my first outing after being sick. I haven't seen the performances of Xin Yanqiu and Ru Fulan for over a decade, and the opening night's plays "Visiting the Zhuang" and "The Jade Hairpin" are their famous masterpieces, so I made a special effort to arrive before 7 o'clock, fearing that I would miss the full spectacle of Fulan's "Visiting the Zhuang". I previously heard that Fulan's eye disease had affected him, and he had switched to playing young male roles, which I deeply regretted. I did not expect that in this demanding martial young male role, not only were his stances more stable, but his fight scenes with Zhang Lianting were also skilled, agile, and full of highlights. There were several moments when the entire audience erupted in applause, earning him unanimous praise from both experts and amateurs. It is agreed that the performance of both holding one end of a spear while simultaneously doing somersaults was the most commendable. When the famous martial artist Li Chunlai from Shanghai performed "Baishuitan", he often displayed this unique skill to the audience. Fulan's somersaults were also very agile and beautiful, showing his deep skill. Among the martial artists in the old capital, only Fulan is the most disciplined and hardworking after the predecessors like Shang, Yang, and Yu. In the past, those predecessors still performed occasionally, all with majestic figures. Someone like Zhou Rui'an was even criticized as being a "small King of Frost" when he occasionally played Xiang Yu, causing Fulan to be suppressed. Although he came south several times, he was never able to become very famous. Now that the old actors have passed away, such as Wan Chun and Sheng Lin, whose stature and skills are no different from Fulan, he is still warmly welcomed by the people in the isolated island. Moreover, his qualifications are deeper, and his voice is suitable for both martial male and martial young male roles, capable of performing Kunqu and various other styles, without losing the classic style of the old school. Now, on the first day of performing martial scenes, he unexpectedly won unanimous praise. I think Fulan, who has been down on his luck for more than a decade, must also feel a little relieved, proving that those with true talent and skill will eventually have their day to shine. After "Visiting the Zhuang" was Zhou Xiaotian's "Empty City Stratagem", which was generally mediocre. Compared to the first performance when following Xiao Yunnan south, he has indeed made great progress. However, his voice is thin and high-pitched, limited by his natural endowment, and those sitting further away find it difficult to hear. However, with his ability to self-motivate and work hard, he has great potential in the future. Xin Yanqiu studied acting the earliest, has rich stage experience, and is excellent in both appearance and acting skills, with delicate performances, truly worthy of being called the "elder stateswoman" of female performers. In addition, Yu Zhenfei's young male roles are refined, elegant, and generous, adding a lot of color to the new actors. Therefore, the "Complete Jade Hairpin" was also very popular with the audience. Although the closing time on that day was slightly later than usual, and those who lived far away had no trams to take, all the audience listened until the end of the play before leaving, which also shows Yanqiu's magic.

### The Plot of "World of Qinhuai"

— Niaoniao

Golden Star's first production, "World of Qinhuai," has been filmed and is scheduled to be shown at the Golden City Theatre soon after "Liang Hongyu." In today's wave of filming so-called "boring movies," it is still progressive for Golden Star to bring Zhang Henshui's literary works to the screen. With the wide readership of "World of Qinhuai," there will undoubtedly be a high degree of interest in the adapted film, and it is expected to be a sensation.

Henshui's novels are known for their plots, and the characters and settings in "World of Qinhuai" are even more fascinating. Men and women with different personalities are captivating on paper, and now they have more active performances on screen; tense moments make people tremble, tragic moments make people feel sad, exciting moments make people feel heroic, and lighthearted moments make people laugh. The interspersed stories include romances in the singing world, and the history of the powerful bullying the weak; there are also upright characters who do not pocket found money; chivalrous heroes who steal to support their mothers; lonely orphans who sell themselves for their mothers; clever and charming women who play with men; idle loafers who stir up trouble; and outstanding figures from all walks of life. The characters are portrayed as fierce tigers, as tame sheep, as women who rebel against authority, and as exceptionally intelligent beauties. There are ruthless three musketeers for gimmicks, and female heroes who eliminate evil alone. In terms of characters, there are pockmarked people, bald people, lame people, fortune tellers, small booksellers, singers, socialites, prostitutes, con artists, gangsters, and tycoons. In terms of plot, there are encounters with beauties, thefts, two kidnappings of girls, several explorations of the devil's den, the hand-killing of evil tyrants, and the burning of a giant house…

Since the film is mostly performed by stage actors, the acting exaggerates the plot, further exciting the audience. In short, this is a masterpiece worth recommending.

### Random Thoughts on Four Quatrains on the Heroes of the Seas

— Zhang Zhenhui

After reading Mr. Wei Ruhui's "Heroes of the Seas," I have composed one quatrain for each act, to express my feelings, regardless of my skill.

(1)

Struggling in the rugged Fujian seas to restore the dynasty,

How can we withstand the court's treacherous obstruction?

You were not a disloyal subject of a fallen nation,

But the late emperors had many regrets.

(2)

Abandoning Xianxia Pass, ceding Fujian's territory,

Exhausting loyalty, serving two dynasties;

Most pitiful is the day the whole family was imprisoned,

Only then did tears of regret surge like a tide!

(3)

The drums rumble, heard for a hundred miles,

The warship floats on the sea, pointing to Nanjing;

The elders of the Central Plains should feel inspired,

And see the heroic banner rising again above Xiaoling.

(4)

On the island, the Ming court's rituals alone remain,

The survivors vow to restore the Han mountains and rivers;

For over thirty years, they maintained the correct calendar,

Whose righteousness is more awe-inspiring than theirs!

### Twenty Types of Yue Opera

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

(5) Ni Feng Stirs Tea

"Ni Feng Stirs Tea" is a

segment from the play Double Phoenix.

Wen Bizheng, in order to sell himself to the Huo family, first takes the path of the matchmaker Ni. Unexpectedly, Ni's daughter, Feng Gu, a hidden gem, is also a desirable choice.

When Ni Fenggu saw such a handsome scholar as Wen Bizheng, she couldn't help but feel restless, causing her to make the mistake of "long scallions and short noodles" when cooking noodles.

(See picture)

(6) Nine Pine Pavilion

The plot of "Pearl Pagoda" also exists in Yue Opera, and the script is roughly the same as the "Ballad."

"Nine Pine Pavilion" is a scene after the "Gifting of the Pagoda." When Fang Qing arrived at the Nine Pine Pavilion, after discovering the secret in the "dry snacks," there are two lines in the song: "Open the package with cakes, inside are the pearl pagoda and the year and day." This is particularly absurd! Chen Cuie, a deeply sheltered young lady, is not a liberated woman of the 20th century; "Gifting the Pagoda" has its reasons, but to give away one's "year and day" to someone, her face must be very thick, not to this extent! In the "Ballad," when Fang Qing and Chen Cuie see each other again, Miss Chen indicates that "the gifting of the pagoda is not about romantic love," which is enough to explain Miss Chen's personality and intentions at the time. This point should be corrected.
