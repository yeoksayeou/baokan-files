### The Yellow River Carries a Large Amount of Silt into the Yangtze River via the Huai River; The Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River are Bound to Suffer a Major Disaster

Chongqing: The Yellow River has been a "Chinese disaster" for thousands of years. According to recent news, the water of the Yellow River is now carrying silt from the high mountains and plains of the northwest and flowing into the Yangtze River via the Huai River, which may endanger the future of this great commercial port. According to the opinions of river dredging experts, such a large amount of silt and water flowing into the Yangtze River will inevitably cause flooding and inundate the upper reaches of the Yangtze River's lower reaches, or even change the course of the Yangtze River. They believe that the change in the course of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River will not only cause floods and damage hundreds of rich industrial and agricultural towns in the eastern suburbs of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, but will also cause Shanghai, the largest industrial, financial, and trade port in the Far East, to lose its original position. Looking back at history, the ancient Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Huai River once converged and entered Hangzhou Bay through Wuxi and Suzhou. Now, whenever the water level of Taihu Lake drops during the dry season, the ruins of ancient prosperous towns can still be seen on the lakebed. These towns were all destroyed centuries ago when the Yellow River changed its course. In May of the year before last, when the Chinese and Japanese armies fought in the Longhai Railway area, the Yellow River breached its banks in Kaifeng, and its water flowed into the Huai River through Gangze Lake, and then into the Yangtze River through the Grand Canal. It was originally expected that the water of the Yellow River would return to its old course this year, but according to the latest news received by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission here, the water of the Yellow River can be determined not to flow back into its old course. Its main flow is now liquidly pouring into the Huai River, destroying all the dams built by the Central Government's Huai River Guidance Committee before the Sino-Japanese War, and entering the Yangtze River. The Chinese authorities originally planned to build several dikes to force the water of the Yellow River to gradually return to its old course, but the war in Henan Province is still ongoing, and the breach in the river has not yet been repaired. Therefore, the Chinese authorities can only sigh in vain and allow the muddy water of the Yellow River to enter the sea through the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, causing a major disaster.

Editorial

### The Near East Situation and Turkey

For several days, the war on the Western Front in Europe has remained dull, but the Near East has shown an unprecedentedly tense scene; news has come, saying that Britain and France are preparing to launch an offensive, or that the Soviet Union is going to invade Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan; there are even rumors that the Soviet Union will cross the Hindu Kush Mountains and the plateaus above the Tibetan snow line to harass India. The Near East countries' precarious state of alert, as well as Britain and France's various measures in their colonies, such as Turkey's implementation of the National Defense Emergency Law, Britain and France's stockpiling of hundreds of thousands of troops, and the transport of military supplies, further illustrate the severity of the situation. It has been said that if Turkey had not joined the Allied Powers in the First European War, the war would have been shortened by two years. Now the German side is constantly trying to break through the British and French blockade from the Balkans, and the Allied side also believes that the Near East is a base for attacking Germany's weaknesses; then, will the current stalemate in the European war repeat past history and spread to the Near East? This is an important issue of common concern, and the attitude of Turkey is particularly critical.

Turkey's importance to the world today stems from its geographical, military, political, diplomatic, and religious factors. For more than a hundred years, it has not only been the hub of Eastern European international politics, but also the target of mutual competition between Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Imperial Russia. After the European War, it rose from a sick man to a strong country; and after the signing of the Treaties of Lausanne and Montreux, it controlled the gateway to the Black Sea; it gained a leading position among the Balkan countries and several Islamic countries in the Near East; at the same time, it maintained general friendly relations with the Soviet Union, Britain, and France. Looking back at the situation 20 years ago, the Balkans and the Near East were fortunate to be safe, undoubtedly due to Turkey's strength and its neutral policy; if post-war Turkey were still the Ottoman Empire of the past, then the Asia Minor and the area near the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea for the past 20 years would not know how many dramas would have been staged, and the impact would have changed the current European war situation. Therefore, how to win Turkey's friendship is still an important topic for European diplomats today, but Turkey itself has its own autonomous stance and will no longer lightly follow the path of bowing and relying on others in the Imperial Era. The diplomatic battles between Britain, France, and Germany with Turkey between the summer and autumn of last year, as well as the failure of the Moscow Soviet-Turkish negotiations, all illustrate that Turkey's choices today are entirely based on its own interests, and it will never easily accept international restrictions, which would only make it a tool for others. It has adhered to this policy with great determination, and there is no sign of change until recently. This has been emphasized in the speech by Turkish Prime Minister Saydam on February 29, which is also the focus of the turmoil in the Near East and the key to its safety.

The Mutual Assistance Agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey, concluded on October 19 last year, is clearly a major victory for the Central Bank of France in the Near East; according to this agreement, Turkey is obligated to assist in the war if war breaks out in the Mediterranean region; at the same time, it gives new strength to its guarantee to Greece and Romania. But there is an important reservation, if Britain and France are at war with the Soviet Union, Turkey is not bound by this agreement. In other words, Turkey's assistance to Britain and France does not apply to the struggle between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This is naturally because the Ten Directions want to maintain consistent friendship with the Soviet Union, always maintain neutrality between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and do not change its attitude due to the lack of results in the Soviet-Turkish talks. But in the past four or five months, the relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has undergone major changes; five months ago, even if there were many contradictions between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, they had not reached the point of hostility; recently, the contradictions have deepened to the extreme, which has caused Turkey's reservations to Britain and France to encounter serious coercion, making Turkey's situation increasingly difficult. But in any case, if any country wants to cross the Dardanelles Strait to attack Batumi or the Crimean Peninsula, it is still unimaginable today, at the very least. The Soviet Union has successively held exercises in the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea in recent days, which shows that it is preparing for the worst; and in fact, as long as Turkey's attitude does not change, the danger of attacks on both sides of the Caucasus region is not necessarily as serious as rumored. As for the Soviet Union's southward advance, even if the country's authorities really have that kind of attempt, it will not be reckless before the results of the Finnish and Western Front wars are seen. The various rumors about the Soviet army's invasion of Islamic countries in recent days are more of an attempt to shake Turkey's neutrality than an overly keen insight.

In short, although the situation in the Near East is extremely serious for Britain, France, Turkey, and the Soviet Union, the danger of war is not very great; if that area is finally inevitably affected by the war in the future, the focus must not be on the Black Sea coast, but rather on the threat from the Danube River basin.

### US President Approves $20 Million Loan to China; Increases Capital of Export-Import Bank; Japan Pays Attention to the Next US Election

Washington: President Roosevelt signed a bill yesterday afternoon to increase the capital of the Export-Import Bank by US$100 million after a 4,000-mile sea voyage, so that he could immediately lend US$20 million in non-military loans to Finland. The bill also allows a new loan of US$20 million to be lent to China. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)

Tokyo: The Japanese are paying unprecedentedly close attention to the next US election, which will be held in November of this year. The semi-official organ "Japan Times" published an editorial, even openly saying that the fate of US political parties and candidates has a great impact on Japan. In the past, the Japanese regarded US election campaigns as a purely domestic issue, but this time it is completely different because the US election campaign is "integrated with the Far Eastern situation." Not only that, but the newspaper frankly expressed its sympathy for the US Republican Party, and at the same time, it did not shy away from saying that President Roosevelt is expected to be re-elected, saying, "If President Roosevelt's "New Deal" is not carried out in a dictatorial manner, it will be difficult to achieve anything. If he is elected president for a third term in the future, he will definitely try to gain a leading position in international politics, so as to be able to use it in American circles, because Roosevelt has no room for maneuver on domestic issues, so he is more interested in world politics. However, it is well known that Roosevelt's domestic policy has a dictatorial nature, so it is almost certain that the "New Deal" he envisions for the world will also have a dictatorial color. In a nutshell, no matter what rhetoric Roosevelt uses, what he wants to force countries to accept is undoubtedly a dictatorial Americanism. If this doctrine despises Japan's doctrine in the Far East, then there will inevitably be an irreparable gap between the two." (2nd Havas dispatch)

Washington: President Roosevelt met with reporters on the train this morning before arriving in Washington. It is said that he has received a report from Wells from Europe, but the content will have to wait until he arrives in Washington before he can discuss it. Regarding the enhancement of the defense of the Panama Canal, Roosevelt said that there is no need to expand the territory. (3rd Haifeng dispatch)

### Japanese Expansion: Nanyang Commerce, Increased Capital for Colonial Company

Tokyo: It is learned that the Nanyang Colonial Development Corporation plans to increase its capital from 20 million yen to 40 million yen this month. The new shares will be subscribed by public institutions and private individuals. This corporation is semi-official in nature, and its mission is to develop agriculture, industry, and commerce in the Japanese-administered islands of the South Seas, and to handle immigration matters. It was established in 1936, located on Koror Island in the Caroline Islands. It first mined phosphate on Angaur Island. In recent years, it has invested 3.5 million yen to establish various affiliated institutions, engaged in pearl farming, fishing, and planting various jackfruit trees. (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)

### Personnel Changes in the Japanese Foreign Ministry: Reformists to be Transferred Out, Pro-British and American Factions Regain Prominence

Tokyo: The "Kokumin Shimbun" predicts that the Foreign Ministry will undergo a complete reshuffle. Most of the "reformists" in the ministry are young officials who disagree with Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita and Vice Minister Masayuki Tani. They will be transferred to serve abroad. A year ago, these reformists were very active in promoting Japan's entry into the Rome-Berlin military alliance. After their efforts failed, pro-American and pro-British opinions in the Foreign Ministry gained prominence. In the dispute over the establishment of a Ministry of Commerce and Trade, which was feared to encroach on the Foreign Ministry's authority, the position of General Kichisaburo Nomura, the former Foreign Minister who advocated cooperation with Britain and the United States, was weakened. At that time, Masayuki Tani offered to resign, but his resignation was rejected by the authorities. According to "Kokumin Shimbun," Tani Masayuki now feels that Foreign Minister Nomura and the entire Abe Cabinet have resigned, and that his past faults have been washed away. The newspaper further states that Tani Masayuki intends to use his efforts to transfer the pro-Axis elements abroad. The first to be transferred is Tatsuo Kawai, the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, who will be appointed as a special envoy to Europe and the United States, and Tadashi Kurihara, the director of the East Asia Bureau, who will be appointed as the Minister to Sweden. Others to be transferred include Matsumoto of the Personnel Division, who will be appointed as a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in Belgium, and Yamada, the director of the Second Europe and America Division, who will be appointed as a first secretary at the Japanese Embassy in the United States. Other "reformists" will be sent to work in Beijing, Harbin, and Moscow. (United Press dispatch on the 3rd)

### Japanese Savings Campaign Unlikely to Succeed: The Idle and Wealthy Buy Antiques and Calligraphy

Tokyo: The Japanese Domestic Savings Bureau has recently launched a savings campaign, stipulating that this year's income savings should be 1.2 billion yen. In other words, every Japanese citizen must save 112 yen. According to the director of the bureau, "I am well aware that it is difficult for low-paid classes to do this, but it concerns the future of the country, and I hope that all parties will do their best." From March 31 last year to the end of last year, savings totaled 790 million yen. The "Kokumin Shimbun" commented, "Unless this savings campaign is successful, Japan's malignant inflation is inevitable." (United Press dispatch on the 3rd)

Tokyo: According to the Japanese Minister of Finance, since the outbreak of the war, a large number of famous antiques, calligraphy, and paintings have been sold. It is reported that from April to December, sales of calligraphy and paintings reached 13,090,000 yen, a significant increase compared to the figures from April 1938 to 1939. This shows that the idle and wealthy people in Japan are still buying a large number of antiques. (United Press dispatch on the 3rd)

### Japanese Military Uniforms Gradually Becoming Unsightly

Tokyo: According to the "Japan Times," the uniforms of the Japanese army are the worst in the world. The poor style of the uniforms makes every tailor with self-respect shake his head. The Japanese army cannot wear European-style military uniforms because most of the Japanese soldiers are from the countryside, and they are not accustomed to wearing clothes other than simple clothing. Currently, the Japanese army should recruit more tailors as soldiers or officers. (United Press dispatch on the 3rd)

### Japanese Intellectuals' Anti-War Sentiment High: Secret Organizations Expanding, Japanese Army in Taiwan Responds

Hong Kong: Keelung foreign news: Japanese intellectuals in Japan have been indignant over the military's oppression of parliamentarian Takao Saito. Coupled with the lack of materials, difficult living conditions, diplomatic failures, and military setbacks, anti-war sentiment is extremely active. Anti-war secret organizations in various places are expanding. Now, the Japanese army in various parts of Taiwan is also responding. The Japanese commander Niu Jitsu Chang is extremely alarmed. He has dispatched a large number of military police to search and arrest, but he is still unable to suppress it. (Dispatch on the 3rd)

### Yoneyama Yoyuu's Resignation Approved: Expelling Saito's Argument Causes Repercussions in the Diet

Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch: Yoyuu Yoneyama, a Japanese Foreign Ministry consul currently serving in the Cultural Affairs Department, wrote an article titled "The Basic Tone for Handling the Incident" in the Diplomatic Times on February 20, denying the Konoe statement and stating that the ideal of East Asia Common Sphere is ultimately not acceptable to the Chinese nation. This, along with Saito's questioning speech, caused related problems. Fearing that his superiors would be implicated, he voluntarily resigned. Now, his resignation has been approved. (Dispatch on the 2nd)

Tokyo: The "Diplomatic Times," which published Yoyuu Yoneyama's article, is no longer sold on the market. Even the parts that have been sold have had the article deleted by the police. (United Press dispatch on the 3rd)

Tokyo: The Japanese government leaders' proposal to expel Saito, who criticized the Konoe statement, from the Diet has today aroused criticism from Kazue Tazawa, a member of the House of Peers. He said, "Under a constitutional government, pressure should not be applied to the people and their representatives. The government should provide clear answers to the questions raised by Saito, and should not refuse to answer them and instead try to expel him from the Diet. This action by the government is an interference with the House of Representatives' own affairs. Although national public opinion has different views on the resolution of the China issue, their differing views are all due to their patriotic concepts. The government's attitude is unfair to Saito. I hope that the responsible leaders will clarify this issue as soon as possible." Minister of State Hoshio Minami replied, "The government has no intention of interfering with the Diet. Regarding the Saito incident, we are taking a hands-off approach." (United Press dispatch on the 3rd)

Tokyo: The Saito issue punishment committee met today and adjourned at 3:00 p.m. During the adjournment, the directors of the Minsei, Seiyukai Nakajima faction, and Kuhara faction held a three-faction board meeting to discuss a compromise plan. As a result, they all agreed that Saito should submit his resignation as a member of the Diet and make a statement. Before the adjournment, there had been various discussions in the committee. If the committee were to reconvene in this state, it would be impossible to discuss and vote on the facts. Also, there were unclear points in the content raised by Saito. Therefore, for the sake of clarity, it was unanimously agreed to postpone the committee to the 6th, when the committee will reconvene at 3:00 p.m. After Chairman Nakai and Vice Chairman Nagano announced this intention, the meeting adjourned after 25 minutes.

### Stalin's Health is Constant: Rumors Disproved

Moscow: The rumors that Soviet leader Stalin is seriously ill have now been disproved. Last night, in order to disprove the absurdity of these rumors, Stalin, accompanied by People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov, Red Army Commander Semyon Budyonny, and others, went to the Bolshoi Theatre to watch a play. On that evening, the ambassadors of various countries, including U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt, were all watching the play in the theatre. Not only did Stalin not look ill, but he also talked and laughed happily. In between the acts, Stalin frequently nodded to the audience to respond to their welcome.

### All-India National Congress Strives for Freedom: Gandhi Publishes an Article, Struggle Will Not be Violent

Calcutta: Mohandas Gandhi, the leader of the All-India Congress, today published an article to a Reuters reporter stating that the All-India National Congress will not be satisfied until India is as free as Britain. The Congress has not closed the door to mediation or negotiation, but this door has been closed by the Secretary of State for India Zetland. As far as the Congress is concerned, there is no possibility of negotiation on Zetland's terms. India under the Congress's influence cannot join the war. In other words, the Congress cannot provide spiritual assistance to Britain. The Congress's resolution also clearly states that if there is a struggle, it will be carried out with strict non-violent discipline. What to do will be chosen by Britain itself.

### Hitler Clarifies Position: Demands a Monroe Doctrine for Central Europe, and Expresses a Willingness to Promote German-American Relations. Welles Met with Hess and Goering Yesterday.

Berlin: U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles had a long conversation with Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, the former president of the German central bank, yesterday. It is learned that the meeting was initiated by Welles expressing to the German Foreign Ministry his hope to meet with German celebrities. Schacht has not engaged in political activities since resigning as president of the central bank and currently lives in Dahlem, a suburb of Berlin. (Haitong dispatch on the 3rd)

Berlin: At 10:00 this morning, Hitler's party representative Hess met Welles at the Wilhelmstrasse office for an hour-long conversation. Afterwards, Mr. Welles traveled by car to the Karinhall villa to visit General Goering, who hosted a grand banquet to entertain him. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)

Berlin: It has just been announced here that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles is scheduled to leave here for Basel, Switzerland, tonight. The German government has specially prepared a train for Welles to ride in, and the German Foreign Ministry will send an official to accompany Welles to the border. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)

Zurich, Switzerland: It is learned that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles plans to return to Lausanne, Switzerland, for a short stay on the afternoon of the 5th or the morning of the 6th of this month, and then travel to Paris on the 7th before 10:00, stay there until the 10th, and then travel to London. On the 14th or 15th, he will return to Paris for a ten-day rest before traveling to Rome. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)

New York: Regarding U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles's audience with Hitler in Berlin, New York newspapers have published it in prominent positions, calling it the "highest point of Welles's information visit." In general, the fact that an honor guard was lined up at the entrance to the Prime Minister's Office to pay respects when Welles arrived at the Prime Minister's Office is highly valued, as it is considered a symbol that Welles's conversation with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was successful. Newspapers believe that Hitler has stated two points to Welles: (1) Germany demands a Monroe Doctrine for Central Europe; (2) The United States is not neutral, and both Hitler and Welles have expressed their hope to promote German-American relations. (Haitong dispatch on the 3rd)

Berlin: Well-informed sources claimed last night that when German leader Hitler had a one-and-a-half-hour conversation with U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday, he told the U.S. special envoy that the world could achieve peace if it followed Germany's terms. He also asked about the United States' neutrality during the European war. The two sides used most of the time to discuss German-American relations. As a result, the vacant ambassadorial positions on both sides may be filled. Well-informed sources claim that Hitler asked Welles about the attitude of the United States and the sympathy of the United States towards the Allied countries. It is said that Hitler frankly stated that, from his personal observation, the United States has failed to strictly maintain neutrality. Therefore, Germany must be vigilant against all democratic countries. Hitler did not agree to adopt direct mediation in mediating the Soviet-Finnish War. It is widely believed that Hitler summarized Germany's war aims and peace conditions based on recent speeches. Hitler's vigilance against democratic countries mainly refers to President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and other well-known Americans condemning "aggression." He expressed displeasure with the United States' shipment of aircraft and military supplies to the Allied countries. Well-informed sources also claim that Hitler told Welles that Germany is fighting for lasting peace and to save the world from British "imperialist oppression." Hitler said that it is Britain, not Germany, that is threatening small neutral countries. Britain has violated international law, forcing Germany to take countermeasures and drag neutral countries into Germany's sphere of self-defense. (United Press dispatch on the 3rd)

The Conflict Between Britain and Germany is Irreconcilable

Washington: Newspapers here have published a Berlin dispatch stating that German leader Hitler, when receiving U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles today, explained to him that his war goal is to destroy British power. The "Evening Star" stated, "It is rumored that the German view is that unless the British Empire collapses, that country will not be able to cease hostilities for a single day. If this is the minimum desire of that country, then the end of the war will inevitably be far away. This kind of peace condition is only enough to strengthen Britain's determination to continue fighting. As for the German claim that Britain is trying to control the world economy, it is even more absurd. The economic relationship between Britain and Germany was very good before the war. Even Prime Minister Chamberlain recently gave a speech saying that under certain conditions, especially under the condition of restoring the independent sovereignty of the Czech and Polish states, Britain will provide economic assistance to Germany." (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)

Maintaining Prestige, Unwilling to Retreat

Rome: President Roosevelt's efforts to mediate the two European wars have been frustrated today. Leader Hitler said in Berlin when talking to U.S. Secretary of State Welles that war or peace is up to Britain and France, because they had declared war on Germany. Reporters also learned from Moscow that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt's efforts to mediate the Soviet-Finnish War have also been fruitless. Therefore, Roosevelt's achievements today are zero to two. Everyone believes that Hitler told Welles that he believes that the U.S. Monroe Doctrine is very valuable and can be imitated, and can also serve as a model for Germany's policy in Europe, so he has sought to achieve a "just and lasting peace" in Europe based on this position. According to reliable sources from Rome, during Welles's conversation with Hitler, it was not clearly proven that a credible peace would bloom with the flowers of spring. On the contrary, Welles felt a sense of indignation that could provoke Roosevelt to sever diplomatic relations between the two countries and withdraw the ambassador to Germany to "slap Germany in the face." Reporters heard that Hitler's conversation was very straightforward, but they also heard that Welles had been told in advance by Mussolini of the expected results. Mussolini seemed impatient with Chamberlain, Halifax, and Daladier's first objective of the war, that Hitler must give in, and seemed to have told Welles that unless the Allied countries forget about this condition, the peace negotiations will be ineffective for a single day. Authoritative sources here deeply believe that today is "Hitler must give in," and tomorrow may be followed by "Mussolini must give in." Reporters learned from reliable sources that Mr. Welles has been deeply moved by Mr. Mussolini's moving personality, lovely charm, immortal conversation, clear thinking, and powerful and correct opinions, which can surpass all other politicians in Europe. Welles initially decided to meet with this modern dictator, and the result was as described above. It is also heard that Welles has gained a good impression in Rome. This decision by the United States has become the largest focus of European diplomatic activity since the outbreak of the two wars, after Roosevelt tried to mediate the war between Britain, France, and Germany, and U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt unofficially mediated the Soviet-Finnish conflict. However, Welles's trip was inevitably attacked by both sides. Both sides were bluffing and unwilling to show weakness. They were all shouting loudly, saying that they did not need Roosevelt's participation and assistance. Just as Welles arrived in Rome, Britain suddenly blockaded the Italian coast to cut off Germany's transportation on the Adriatic Sea, while also putting pressure on the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries. These countries have been attacked from both sides and will inevitably be trapped in a desperate situation. At this time, Daladier canceled the censorship of news, and the French newspapers immediately began to criticize Italy, just like some London newspapers. As for the Italian newspapers, they initially paid little attention to Welles's visit to Europe, and later showed great interest. However, some newspapers still predicted to the public that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union had the possibility of adopting a common defense. According to diplomatic intelligence obtained by reporters from Moscow, Roosevelt's order to the ambassador to the Soviet Union to mediate the war has not been successful, whether formally or informally, because Stalin is determined to restore the prestige he has lost in the attack on Finland. Stalin was greatly embarrassed after the "Western capitalist powers" decided to organize a united front to resist Soviet Russia. Therefore, his initial goal in invading Finland was to obtain military strongholds on the northern coast of Finland to serve as naval, land, and air bases to ensure the security of the Soviet Union and to resist naval and land attacks from that place. Everyone believes that Stalin, because of the excessive number of Red Army casualties and the great loss of his personal prestige, will inevitably make the terms of the armistice more stringent than those initially proposed.

Bleak Prospects for Mediating the European Situation

Amsterdam: The German newspapers only recorded the visit of U.S. State Department official Welles to Berlin in a few lines, and after Welles arrived in Berlin, they revealed threatening news that Germany would launch a large offensive soon, and issued a declaration that, as far as Germany is concerned, the war cannot be ended without the use of force. At the same time, the newspapers were full of inspired words denouncing Britain. Stories of various atrocities committed by Britain in India and Ireland during the South African War have now reappeared in the newspapers. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)

Washington: Foreign observers here recently stated that some people in the United States originally believed that there was still a possibility of mediating the European war. The preliminary results of Undersecretary of State Welles's visit to the German authorities today have completely shattered this illusion. Those in political circles said that the statements made by German spokesmen and the arguments made by the country's newspapers are enough to clarify that the German government probably wants to use Welles's trip to Berlin to stimulate the world's hearing. It is heard that Hitler and Ribbentrop have proposed peace conditions to Welles. If these conditions are accepted, it would be tantamount to acknowledging Germany's conquest and acknowledging its "space for expansion of life at any time"‚Äîa theory. However, as far as the United States is concerned, the ambassadors of the Czech and Polish states in the United States still exist, which shows that the United States has never recognized Germany's annexation of the territories of these countries. Although Germany threatens with a "desperate fight," American public opinion is still very calm, believing that its intention is to shake the morale of Britain and France and threaten the neutral countries, which is not worth mentioning. In short, Germany has first launched a war, explaining that the country's war goals are incompatible with those of Britain and France. For this reason, Welles will be able to obtain convenience when conducting talks with British and French authorities in the future. (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)

### Italy Conscripts New Soldiers: Enlisted for Training, No Leave Granted from This Month

Rome: The Italian Ministry of Defense has issued an order to conscript all unmarried young men born in 1892, 1893, 1894, 1919, 1920, and 1921 who have not received military training due to deferment of military service for training. (Haitong dispatch on the 3rd)

Rome: The Italian Ministry of the Army issued a notice that soldiers will not be granted leave from March 1st. Officials explained the reason for this move, saying that most of the soldiers who are currently enlisted for compulsory training have no family, which is different from the previous grades, so there is no need to ask for leave to go home.

### German Aircraft Crosses Belgian Airspace, Shoots Down Two Belgian Planes, Belgium Lodges Strong Protest with Germany, Deeming This an Act of Infringement on Neutrality

Beijing: According to sources in Belgian official circles, yesterday, above Saint-Hubert in Belgian and Luxembourg territory, a German Dornier Do 17 aircraft, while being pursued by Belgian aircraft, actually shot down two Belgian planes. A Belgian pilot, Lieutenant Hanrade, died. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak has lodged a firm protest with the German ambassador to Belgium, objecting to this act of aggression that violates neutrality. It is reported that the German aircraft was heavily armed and, when pursued, opened fire on three Belgian patrol planes. Two Belgian planes were hit multiple times. The command plane of the Belgian patrol squadron continued the pursuit, but it was also hit and the pilot was killed. The pilot of the second Belgian plane parachuted to the ground and escaped harm. The third Belgian plane, although also hit, landed safely. Yesterday, three other Belgian Air Force planes crashed. Two planes collided over Lanst, both crashing to the ground and being destroyed. Another plane crashed into a garden while practicing in the sky above Beijing. (Reuters, 3rd)

Beijing: The semi-official Belgian News Agency has just issued a message stating that several aircraft of unknown nationality intruded into our country's airspace this morning. Anti-aircraft artillery units opened fire to drive them away. In addition, regarding the German aircraft's intrusion into our country's airspace yesterday, resulting in the shooting down of one of our country's patrol planes and the death of pilot Lieutenant Hanrade, Foreign Minister Spaak lodged a strong protest with German Ambassador Schwand yesterday afternoon. At the same time, he instructed the ambassador to Germany, Davignon, to lodge a protest with the German government, using very strong language. However, as of now, no reply has been received from Germany. The government has decided that if foreign aircraft intrude into our country's airspace again, it will deal with them with the most severe measures. (Havas, 3rd)

### British Air Fleets Fly Over Germany for Reconnaissance, Drop Leaflets Over Berlin, Searchlights Pierce the Sky

London: According to a communiqu√© issued by the British Air Force today, British Air Force bombers flew over Berlin last night, dropping tens of thousands of leaflets and flares to show that British planes had again flown over Berlin. Key cities in northwestern Germany and Baltic Sea ports have been almost entirely reconnoitered by other British aircraft. British planes also closely monitored the German seaplane bases at Bogenoda Danie and Sylt. The British planes only fully returned to their original bases after daybreak. According to reports from those who flew over Berlin, when approaching Berlin and while over Berlin, they saw the flashes of anti-aircraft guns. The firing of Berlin land batteries into the air was the first wave, but the fire was far from the target, so the British bomber squadrons did not need to evade it. The Berlin searchlights were also very active, but the British aircraft, in carrying out their mission, were not detected by the lights. The lights were pale green. According to reports from those who have flown over Berlin several times before and after, the searchlights only appeared when the flares were dropped. Some British aircraft reconnoitering in northwestern Germany were illuminated by the lights once. (Reuters, 3rd)

London: According to official sources today, British bombers flew over Berlin last night, for the fifth time in six days. At that time, leaflets and torches were dropped to let residents know. Numerous searchlight beams shot into the sky from the ground, turning the bluish-white sky red and yellow. However, the Berlin searchlights were not as active as usual. At that time, artillery batteries outside Berlin fired about six shots, but the leaflets were still dropped. German fighter planes initially took off but were not heard to have engaged with the British planes. The British planes flew for a total of ten hours and all returned safely to their bases. (Reuters, 3rd)

London: It seems that aircraft of the British Royal Air Force, while inspecting German seaplane bases last night, were subjected to intense bombardment by large-caliber German guns. According to official sources, the Germans ultimately failed to prevent the British patrol squadrons from carrying out their work. When the British aircraft appeared over Sylt, Norderney, and Borkum, all the ground lights were turned off, making it very difficult for seaplanes to take off. These British aircraft often fly over 800 miles every night, or treat this as routine work. This is largely due to the cautious command of the British aircraft, which enables them to navigate dangerous situations safely and return with brief reports stating that when they flew away from the islands, there was not a single light to be seen on the islands. (Reuters, 3rd)

Berlin: Yesterday, German Air Force reconnaissance flights went to the outskirts of Paris and northeastern France. More than a dozen German aircraft returning were pursued by seven British fighter planes, resulting in a fierce aerial battle that resulted in the downing of four British planes. The German planes returned safely to their bases. (Haitong Electric, 3rd)

German Reuters: A message from London states that the above news is completely inaccurate.

London: The Aviation Department has just issued a communiqu√© stating that the British Air Force on the French front shot down two German planes today. One was a Dornier type, which crashed in French territory, and the other was a Messerschmitt type, which crashed in German territory. (Havas, 2nd)

Swiss Capital: The German High Command has just issued a communiqu√© stating that our aircraft flew into the North Sea yesterday and attacked two British scout ships and eleven armed merchant ships, immediately inflicting heavy damage on them. Our planes also flew to various locations in northeastern France and Paris for reconnaissance flights and shot down two French planes on the front line. Two of our planes have not yet returned to their bases. (Havas, 3rd)

London: The Italian ship "Mira" (2,270 tons) was bombed by German planes in the North Sea yesterday and strafed with machine guns, but the damage was minimal. It has sailed to a port in eastern Scotland today, and all crew members are safe. According to the shipowner, the German planes did not clearly recognize that the ship belonged to Italy. Another Italian merchant ship, "Mirella No. 1," sank after striking a mine in the North Sea yesterday. Sixteen crew members have landed in Grimsby, three of whom sustained minor injuries. In addition, German planes again attacked ships of various countries in the sea this morning. British authorities immediately dispatched fighter planes to drive them away. (Havas, 2nd)

Dutch Capital: The German ship "Hisosos" entered the port of Rotterdam from overseas, just as the British ship "Merito" was leaving the port. The two ships collided suddenly in the canal connecting the port to the North Sea, both suffering significant damage. The British ship has returned to the port for repairs. (Havas, 2nd)

The Hague: The Dutch ship "Soesterberg," loaded with a batch of corn purchased by the Dutch government, was intercepted by a German submarine 300 miles west of the island of Texel on January 17. However, after the captain inspected the ship's manifest, he allowed it to proceed. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Australian Pilots Begin to be Recruited, Will Complete Training in Canada

London: A German-language broadcast occurred in Sydney, Australia, stating that Australia is starting to recruit Australian pilots from today to implement the Empire Air Force Training Plan. The number of those enlisting in the coming months will continue to increase. Some pilots will complete their training in Canada, but most will be trained in Australia. According to the Empire Air Force Plan, more than 30,000 pilots, observers, and gunners will be recruited to train 26,000 fully trained pilots. This is Australia's commitment to provide. According to official announcements, each recruit must undergo different tests by fifteen experts before being allowed to join the team. From this, it can be seen how extensive the organization of the recruiting agency is. It is expected that there will be a hundred respondents each month. Experts estimate that 20 percent will fail the tests. However, this does not mean that the intellectual standards or general efficiency of Australian youth are low. Australian Minister for Air Fairbairn said that weaknesses discovered during training in new, high-speed aircraft cannot be detected by even the best medical tests. There are often those who are extremely physically fit but cannot tolerate physical discomfort, and there are also those who, due to personal characteristics, cannot accept wireless and other mechanical knowledge. Fairbairn also said that the five thousand-odd schools for training mechanics will open in June of this year. There are already three established schools, with 1,100 mechanics already studying there. The duration of the course is indefinite, averaging sixteen weeks. (Reuters, 1st)

### Soviet-Finnish War Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse, Viborg Encircled on Three Sides, Finnish Troops Rely on Natural Defenses to Firmly Defend the Third Line of Defense, 2,000 Soviet Troops Annihilated Northeast of Lake Ladoga

Moscow: According to a communiqu√© from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, yesterday, the Soviet troops' offensive in the Karelian Isthmus continued to develop. Soviet troops occupied the Viborg railway station marshalling yards and the southern part of Viborg. Soviet troops have now surrounded Viborg from the north and south. North of Viborg, Soviet troops have occupied Temus Station. At the same time, Cape Koivistonniemi and Tuppurissaari Island, southwest of Viborg, have also been occupied by Soviet troops. Furthermore, east of Viborg, Soviet troops have captured the towns of Kantema and Lappeenranta. There have been no significant developments in other areas.

The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy military targets and shot down seven enemy planes in air battles. (TASS, 3rd)

Swedish Capital: News from the Finnish front reports that the Red Army's heavy artillery continued to bombard the port of Viborg today. After three weeks of heroic resistance, the Finnish troops have secured new positions and continue to fight. This position they are holding is the third line of defense, built with strong fortifications, extending 30 kilometers from the port of Viborg to the west bank of Lake Vuoksi. This is 20 kilometers shorter than the second line of defense. The terrain through which it passes is rugged, with the port of Viborg and coastal batteries on the right, and the natural barrier of Lake Vuoksi on the left. The Finnish troops have also built numerous observation posts, dug traps, and laid mines, which are very conducive to defense. (Havas, 2nd)

Helsinki: This morning, the Finnish military headquarters issued a statement saying that the Soviet 34th Tank Brigade was destroyed north of Lake Ladoga last night. Finnish troops can restore their old positions in the north of the lake. However, the Soviet artillery fire attacking the Finnish defenses in the north is fiercer than before. The battle around Nuosjoki is particularly fierce. The Soviet Air Force is bombing earlier than before. The Soviet army has recently adopted a new weapon, which is a snowmobile with a motorcycle, each vehicle equipped with two machine guns and carrying three soldiers, which moves very quickly. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

Moscow: According to military sources here, the Soviet troops have been attacking the defense works of the Mannerheim Line since February 11, with a large number of artillery reinforcements to the Karelian Isthmus. It has been three weeks. Previously, due to the extreme cold, large-scale offensives could not be carried out. At the same time, the areas around Taipale and Lake Ladoga were extremely difficult to attack due to the winding lakes and marshes. Therefore, the initial troops attacking Lake Ladoga and Taipale were unsuccessful. In the second week, Soviet troops used their main force to pressure the railroad between Leningrad and Viborg, advancing to K√§m√§r√§ and then invading the Mannerheim Line by ten kilometers, occupying the Bj√∂rk√∂ Peninsula and advancing to Muolaa. Thereupon, the Finnish troops retreated to the second line of defense. Due to the difficult terrain, the Russian troops could not use heavy artillery, so they also reorganized and adjusted their troops, preparing to resume the offensive. According to recent front-line reports, the western section of the Mannerheim Line has been breached, but there is still fighting between Suvantol and Taipale. This line of defense extends east from Kiviniemi Bay to Kittel√§ and directly to the southern suburbs of Viborg. (Haitong Electric, 3rd)

Helsinki: Yesterday's communiqu√© here stated that 2,000 corpses of dead Soviet soldiers were discovered northeast of Lake Ladoga. The Soviet army also left behind a large number of military supplies, including 100 intact tanks. It is reported that this was the 34th Tank Brigade, hoping to rush to support the 18th Division, which had recently been annihilated, but unexpectedly froze to death in that area. The Finnish troops in the Karelian Isthmus have withdrawn to the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSainio, five miles south of Viborg, and the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHeinjoki, seventeen miles east of Viborg, and the Soviet troops attacking Heinjoki have advanced at least five miles in a week.

Moscow: Last night, the local radio station responded to speculation that the Soviet Union would be prepared to negotiate peace with Finland after its military victory, saying that in any case, the "Finnish Civil War" would definitely not stop in the form desired by the Mannerheim protagonists. Twenty years ago, British and French imperialists preserved the White Guard from extinction, but such an event will not be allowed to happen again today. (Reuters, 3rd)

### A General Account of the German Army, Navy, and Air Force's Achievements in Six Months of War

‚ÄîOfficially Announced by Berlin‚Äî

Berlin: The German High Command announced last night that after six months of combat, the German army had achieved the following results:

On the army front, the Polish army was defeated within eighteen days, and western Poland was occupied. The enemy's attempt to force Germany to fight on two fronts was thwarted. On the Western Front, the enemy could not cross the Siegfried Line, and the German army's reconnaissance activities and raids fully demonstrated its superior training and equipment. Enemy attacks were repelled.

On the naval front, after eliminating the Polish navy, the German navy fought against the British and French navies, focusing on commerce. Enemy merchant ships were attacked on the surface and underwater, and mines were laid near the British coast. The German pocket battleship "Graf Spee" and "Deutschland" attacked enemy merchant ships in the Atlantic. The German navy has sunk the enemy's battleship "Royal Oak," aircraft carrier "Courageous," auxiliary cruiser "Rawalpindi," destroyers "Blanche," "Gypsy," "Duchess," "Grenville," "Exmouth," "Viscount," "Glowworm," "Gipsy," and eight others, as well as 30 patrol boats, minesweepers, and submarines. It has also damaged the enemy's battleship "Nelson," "Barham," battlecruiser "Repulse," heavy cruiser "Exeter," cruiser "Belfast," and many destroyers, patrol boats, and auxiliary ships. At the same time, 532 merchant ships were sunk, totaling 1,904,013 tons. In contrast, Germany's losses were only one pocket battleship, two destroyers, six patrol boats, one minesweeper, and eleven submarines.

On the air force front, after participating in the Polish campaign, reconnaissance flights were made over Britain and France. Flights were made to the Orkney and Shetland Islands of Britain, and enemy warships and merchant ships were attacked, sinking 65 ships, totaling 75,000 tons, and destroying 52 ships, totaling 200,000 tons, including two cruisers of 15,300 tons, one battleship of 63,350 tons, and one aircraft carrier of 22,600 tons. Since the outbreak of the European war, Germany's air defense organization has become more widespread and rigorous. Enemy planes attempting to intrude into Germany have been repelled by German fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns. To date, 285 British and French planes have been shot down, and 50 planes from aircraft carriers have also been destroyed, totaling 335 planes lost by the Allied countries, and 9 balloons. The German Air Force only had 35 planes destroyed in action on the Western Front, and only 43 were forced to land or crash.

The 82,000,000 German people, under the protection of the German army, navy, and air force, are developing their capabilities and preparing for future wars. Germany's military industry has not been affected by the enemy's blockade plan and has made significant progress. Germany's front and rear are full of elite soldiers and excellent weapons, preparing for wars to come. (Haitong Electric, 30th)

### Allied Countries Intensify Economic Warfare Against Germany, Italy Protests Blockade of German Coal, Britain Asks US to Ban Oil Exports to Neutral Countries

Rome: After the British government decided to consider German coal shipped to Italy as contraband and impound it, the Italian government has drafted a protest, which the Italian ambassador to Britain, Bastianini, will send to the British government. The content states that the German coal was shipped by Italian operations and should not be considered contraband. Italian sources here believe that Britain may not refuse to accept Italy's request and may not insist that Italy supply Britain with heavy industrial products, but may sell British coal to Italy. They also said that the German coal was shipped to Italy from Rotterdam, Netherlands. If British warships impound it, Dutch ports will be severely hit, which Britain should consider. As for the rumors that Italy will hold talks with the United States in an attempt to purchase US coal to replace German coal, responsible officials here denied this, but said that if negotiations between Italy and Britain fail, Italy may negotiate with the United States. However, the price of US coal is 50 percent higher than that produced by Britain or Germany. (Havas, 2nd)

Washington: The British ambassador to the United States notified the US oil companies that it would temporarily not issue naval certificates for machine oil shipped to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark to facilitate its transportation. According to investigations, these three countries currently have enough machine oil in stock to meet their needs for several months to come. If imports continue, they will flow into Germany. The British are currently trying to reach an agreement with importers in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark regarding the normal quantity of oil imports. (Reuters, 3rd)

London: Lord Lothian, the British ambassador to the United States, yesterday advised major US oil companies to temporarily refrain from shipping lubricating oil to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Economic figures here have commented on this, saying that since the implementation of the blockade policy, contraband is still leaking" into Germany, and Germany is continuing its foreign trade by borrowing the territorial waters and territories of various neutral countries. There are many examples of this (German coal being shipped to Italy from Dutch ports is one example). Therefore, there has long been a plan to intensify the economic blockade of Germany. Ambassador Lothian's advice yesterday was actually the beginning of this plan. Some people even believe that Italy has indeed become Germany's warehouse, and all kinds of materials needed by Germany are supplied by Italy. It is difficult to listen to this situation naturally. Some important figures in British political circles are therefore advocating for restricting the purchase of goods by neutral countries near Germany, such as Hungary. In other words, the various important raw materials and food needed by these neutral countries must be limited in their quantity of purchase according to a certain standard, so as to avoid indirectly assisting the enemy. Although this claim is still far from being realized, it proves that Britain still needs to make further efforts in the economic war. ((Havas, 3rd)

### Four Italian Ships Carrying German Coal Turn Back to Rotterdam Midway

Dutch Capital: Thirty Italian ships, with a total tonnage of 200,000 tons, are now in Dutch ports, especially the port of Rotterdam, loading German coal in preparation for shipping it back to Italy. As of now, five or six ships have been loaded, and four of them set sail from the port of Rotterdam this morning. However, upon hearing that the British government had decided to impound them, they temporarily turned back. According to Italian sources in the port, our country ordered this batch of coal from Germany a long time ago, but due to the severe winter last year, it was delayed until now that ships could be sent to load it. Since this transaction was not recently concluded, we hope that the British authorities will still be able to accommodate it. (Havas, 2nd)

### Britain and France Adjust Wartime Trade with Belgium, Separate Agreements Signed

Beijing: According to today's news, agreements adjusting wartime trade between Belgium and Britain and between Belgium and France have been signed in London and Paris. Contacts between the Belgian and German governments are still maintained in order to adapt trade between Belgium and Germany to wartime conditions within the framework agreed upon in 1935. (Reuters, 1st)

### Leipzig Fair Opens

Hitler Sends a Congratulatory Telegram

Berlin: F√ºhrer Hitler sent a congratulatory telegram on the opening day of the Leipzig Spring Fair, stating that the 1940 Leipzig Spring Fair is a wartime fair. I wish it success. The conference is a clear indication that Germany's economic strength has not been undermined. It also benefits the economic life of various countries that export excellent products from neutral countries to Germany during wartime. (Haitong News Agency, 1st)

Berlin: Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels said in a speech at the opening ceremony of the Leipzig Exhibition today that Germany has had to engage in hard work to shrink its economy because of the lack of many important raw materials. However, due to the timely implementation of various plans and precautions, the enemy has been unable to starve Germany. Although the number of foreign raw material and food exhibitors has decreased by 71 at this exhibition, there are still 6,400 people, which greatly proves that in addition to the work being done to advance Germany's domestic trade, its foreign trade during the war is also very active. (Reuters, 3rd)

Hygiene of the Sexes

### The Union of a Happy Marriage - Reproduction Must be Healthy

‚Äî Yang Daonan, Doctor of Medicine from the Russian Labor University

You must recognize that the fundamental concept of marriage is that a man and a woman open "themselves" to each other to obtain a lifelong partner with the closest relationship, rather than "parents" "choosing a spouse" and "taking a daughter-in-law." Therefore, marriage must not be decided by parents. Young people should choose a good spouse and a good husband so they don't regret it later!

Although the parties involved should choose their own partners, how can one obtain a good spouse? This requires going through a process, and that process is "love." Therefore, we know that love is the first condition, the core, and the essence of marriage; a marriage that is the result of true love between the two parties is a truly happy and rational marriage.

Here, you must first understand the true meaning of love! Love is a special affection between different genders that originates from reproduction. However, you cannot think of it as merely a simple reproductive impulse; love can only be established when reproduction reaches a healthy state!

For example, if either the man or the woman has conditions such as underdevelopment, kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, impotence, or menstrual irregularities and anemia in women, there will be a lack of satisfactory cooperation in reproductive work, affection will gradually decrease, and ultimately there will be no happiness, and the unity of the family will be broken.

Why do men have the various problems mentioned above? These are all due to indulging in masturbation before marriage, which leads to nocturnal emission and seminal emission, and the youth glands are damaged and lose their health. The semen in the testicles gradually becomes withered. Women also suffer from menstrual disorders, infertility, and other conditions due to the loss of health of the youth glands, and the consequences are worrying.

Since the youth gland is the source of the couple's abilities, then the love between men and women must rely on the prosperity of the youth gland to increase. If the youth gland is damaged by indulgence and licentiousness, symptoms such as kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, and menstrual irregularities will arise. The method of treatment must be to take a strong animal youth gland hormone preparation, "Biotics for Men," to revitalize the weakened youth gland and produce a large amount of sperm and blood. After treatment using the above method, the above symptoms can be immediately rejuvenated. After continuous use for two or three weeks, one will feel clear-headed, have novel thoughts, have healthy reproductive function, and enjoy satisfactory cooperation. For women, the effect of regulating menstruation and treating anemia and premature aging is even greater.

Gonorrhea's Tribulations

### Gonorrhea Treatment Worthy of Attention

‚Äî Dr. Huang Zhongchang, MD, USA

A treatment for gonorrhea that attracts the attention of the medical community is, of course, worthy of attention, but it does not mean that a treatment that attracts attention is successful. For example, the chemical therapies that are currently popular, upon closer examination, have aspects that are unclear to us, because these therapies cannot be universally applied to acute and chronic gonorrhea. Some chemical therapies show some efficacy in acute cases, and some show some efficacy in chronic cases. None of these are superior treatments for gonorrhea, and according to our repeated clinical experiments, general chemical therapies often have strong reactions. Statistical analysis shows that the failures of chemical therapy far outweigh the successes, so there is now a phenomenon of decline in chemical therapy.

For the treatment of gonorrhea, we must adopt comprehensive treatment to avoid unsuccessful outcomes. In this regard, we must recommend "Neo-Clinon" (available at Taihe Pharmacy), invented by the German gonorrhea master Dr. Peter. Based on my many years of experience, the drug "Neo-Clinon" has cured gonorrhea that is difficult to treat with general chemical therapies. According to patients who came to my clinic, they were suffering from arthritis and had undergone chemical therapy without any effect. When asked, they said that the effect of the drug had not yet arrived. After taking it for more than a month, it was still like a stone sinking into the sea, so they returned disappointed and sought treatment from me.

After scientifically diagnosing the condition, I used the latest improved chemical therapy preparation "Neo-Clinon" for treatment. Every day, blood was drawn from the joints and examined under a microscope. Only a gradual decrease in gonococci was observed until there were none. The difficult-to-treat gonococcal arthritis was completely and fundamentally cured. The reason for this is that after taking "Neo-Clinon," the body's cells can produce a kind of anti-gonococcal substance that is widely distributed in the areas where gonococci are located, so the gonococci can be completely eliminated. Compared with the general chemical therapy of local sterilization of individual branches, there is a world of difference, so it is appropriate that "Neo-Clinon" is popular all over the world and is appreciated by people. From this point of view, "Neo-Clinon" is the highest authority in chemical therapy and cannot be compared with ordinary chemical therapy.

### The Most Appropriate Treatment for the Lungs

‚Äî Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Due to the progress of science, the general treatment of lung diseases has made great strides, such as the application of surgical operations, physical pneumothorax, and internal medicine drugs to shrink the affected area of the lungs. These are the brilliant colors released by 20th-century science, and they are also considered the most rational treatments by various famous scholars.

However, the treatment of academic theory and surgery must have its indications and cannot be applied to all patients. Therefore, what this vast group of patients relies on from science is the "Pulmonal," an oral medicine invented by Dr. Tumeibo of German Internal Medicine Therapy, which is the most suitable because it best meets economic conditions and self-care. Also, because of its rapid efficacy, when patients take "Pulmonal" when the disease is progressing, it can be turned into a static state, and hemoptysis and cough immediately disappear.

### Case of Curing Health Lost Through Masturbation

‚Äî Dr. Zheng Ting, MD, Germany

Patient Jiang Jianming, 19 years old, from Changzhou, (self-reported) ‚Äî‚Äî Four years ago, when I was boarding at a middle school in Mucheng, I was tempted by a classmate in the same dormitory to play with my genitals with my hands to release sperm for pleasure. At first, I didn‚Äôt know the harm, and I was even more confused by obscene dramas. What I committed became a habit out of trying, and for four years, my body became thin and emaciated, my face was pale and yellow, my spirit was weak and tired, and I had no vitality at all. Now, following my mother's orders, I am about to get married and I implore you to treat me. (Cured after treatment) ‚Äî‚Äî Upon examination, it was found that Jiang‚Äôs reproductive function was damaged by masturbation, the seminal gate was not strong, and he had nocturnal emission four times a week, at least two or three times. I prescribed him the German special medicine for nocturnal emission, "Neures Night Emission Pills," and instructed him to take three pills before going to bed. After a week, there was no nocturnal emission, which proved to be quite effective. At the same time, I gave him electrotherapy and prescribed the German testicular endocrine tonic "Biotics for Men" to nourish the loss, nourish the brain, nourish the blood, and nourish the sperm. So far, he has taken it for a month, and not only has the nocturnal emission stopped early, but he has also gained nine pounds in weight, his complexion is rosy, and his appetite has increased. It is possible to stop taking the medicine, because Jiang is aware of the greatness of the restorative power of "Biotics for Men" and the accuracy of its effect, so he continues to take it. He is scheduled to hold the wedding in early March, and he sent a letter to thank me and is willing to tell the same patients so that lost young people have the opportunity to renew and strengthen themselves.

Gonorrhea Lecture

### Acute Gonorrhea With Unbearable Pain

‚Äî Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic Address: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

Acute gonorrhea usually breaks out after a considerable incubation period after intercourse with the opposite sex. Once it occurs, there is unbearable pain inflicted on the patient. At this time, the patient often has an abnormal psychological state. That is, to seek a quick cure, and the minimum requirement is to relieve pain. That's right, the pain in the acute stage of gonorrhea can be said to be the most unbearable of all diseases. Because we all know that our genitals have the most sensitive nerves. Even the slightest contact with grass or trees can be felt keenly. What's more, this kind of burning gonococcal condition causes an abnormal change in the urethra - inflammation of the urethra, pus congestion, forcing gonorrhea patients to have no way to go to heaven or earth. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable and not to be blamed for gonorrhea patients to want to reduce his pain.

However, in this unbearable situation, the requirement for pain relief must be based on anti-gonococcal bacteria, because if you don't use anti-gonococcal bacteria and only use anesthetics to anesthetize the patient's nerves, although temporary pain relief is achieved, you don't know that this kind of pain relief will weaken the original resistance in most cases. Therefore, after the effect of the medicine wears off, the pain becomes even more severe. This is like a person who eats opium, who feels comfortable when he eats opium, but his spirit becomes even more depressed afterward. Based on my many years of experience, the only way to treat this disease is to take the latest improved chemical therapy "Neo-Clinon" (available at Taihe, Zhengwei, and other major pharmacies), which has a remarkable effect on killing bacteria and also has the effect of anti-inflammatory and diuretic. In this way, the pain of gonorrhea will stop spontaneously. If I assist with static electricity therapy, the effect will be even faster. Consultation hours are from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day. 20 numbers are sent out per consultation, and only 5 cents are charged per number.

### Someone Suggested That the Public Works Department Create Shanghai Municipal Lottery Tickets - The Purpose Is to Seek Future Prosperity - Major Cities in the World Have Many Precedents - The Public Works Department Is Now Carefully Considering This Matter

The editorial of the Zi Lin Bao on the 3rd stated, "According to reliable sources, someone recently suggested to the Public Works Department to investigate the possibility and hope of holding Shanghai municipal lottery tickets. The main purpose of this plan is not to reduce the current financial difficulties, but to seek future progress and prosperity for the city. Although the Public Works Department can overcome its difficulties by adding donations and issuing 10 million yuan in bonds, it is doubtful whether these two measures are sufficient to meet the future needs of Shanghai to ensure the future development of Shanghai."

Municipal Expenses Require a Lot of Money

After nearly three years of war, the city's trade has been sluggish, public works and construction activities have stalled, and everything has generally declined. However, huge sums of money need to be constantly flowing in to cover municipal expenses to cope with the increasingly close normal situation.

Municipal Lottery Tickets Are Common in Various Countries

Some say that since the Public Works Department opposed any form of lottery tickets several years ago, it may not support this move now. However, we can refute this with the fact that time is changing day by day. Lottery tickets are different from other speculative methods, such as securities trading, horse racing, and other undertakings that rely heavily on chance and luck. In fact, many countries around the world have held national or municipal lottery tickets for experimentation. The most recent country to announce its intention to do so is Japan. Even Hong Kong publicly sold the last horse racing lottery tickets to help the British wartime central base and hospitals and was very successful.

Future Cost Difficulties Will Increase

The Shanghai Public Works Department has always had to allocate funds to support agencies and projects that the public does not want to be supported by municipal expenses, which places a heavy burden on the department, such as chambers of commerce, hospitals, schools, and even prisons. Now, in addition to the necessary expenses for police, public works, fire brigades, and sanitation, the Public Works Department seems unable to adequately maintain chambers of commerce and hospitals, etc. For example, the Public Works Department wants to devote more effort to education, but maintaining schools, hospitals, and sanatoriums is becoming increasingly difficult. In addition, there are now urgent problems with rice and beggars.

If This Move Is Successful, It Will Make Significant Contributions

There is no doubt that Shanghai municipal lottery tickets can be successful, just like the government lottery tickets of other countries. The satisfactory result of the lottery tickets in the Irish Free State is a notable example. Low exchange rates will attract money from other countries to participate in the monthly or quarterly draws. The Public Works Department can make great contributions by doing so, and it is not only what we hope to recreate a model public concession.

The Bureau Is Considering Preparation for Implementation

The proposal for municipal lottery tickets was put forward with enthusiasm. It is said that the Public Works Department is now carefully considering this matter, and it is sympathetic and fortunate. If the authorities want to protect the bright future that the city deserves, they can only take realistic actions boldly in all matters. It is hoped that municipal charitable lottery tickets will be launched to ensure that all undertakings that the Public Works Department should not maintain with small taxes will be successful, and the Public Works Department will have sufficient funds to make this great city a more glorious and healthy place to live.

### American Woman Walsh Disappeared in Hongkou - No News After Leaving - The Police Department Is Investigating Strictly

The Mainland News reported that American woman Walsh, a former sailor in the US Navy, has disappeared in Shanghai. According to Walsh's wife's report to the Police Department yesterday (the 2nd), her husband entered Hongkou at around 4 p.m. on Friday, leaving his hired car south of the Sichuan Road Bridge, and has not returned since. Ms. Hu has never left home and not returned, so she is afraid that she has met with misfortune this time. The chauffeur told Mrs. Walsh yesterday that Mr. Walsh said that he would return within an hour when he entered Hongkou, but he waited until night and still did not see Mr. Walsh return south, so he went home by himself. The Public Concession Police Department was still searching last night.

### Tragic Capsizing of the Jingsheng Ship - Passengers Panicked and Caused the Accident - It Was Heard That an Air Raid Alarm Caused the Crowd to Flee - The Ship Tilted Too Much and Eventually Sunk - The Driver Was Also Temporarily Careless, Resulting in a Major Change

Ningbo, 2nd - Since the war, Shanghai-Ningbo shipping vessels have been anchored outside Zhenhai Port. Passengers must take a small boat from Ningbo to the exit to board the ship. When a Moufu commercial ship opened to Shanghai from Zhenhai on the 2nd, there were more than 400 passengers from Ningbo. At 11:20, they took the Jingsheng steamship to the exit. As the ship was untying, a Japanese plane passed over the city's sky. The order on the ship was disrupted, and the driver was also temporarily careless, resulting in a sinking. Only a dozen passengers were rescued. As of 6 p.m., less than ten bodies had been recovered.

The traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo has always been served by Shanghai-Ningbo shipping vessels that carry passengers and cargo. However, since the implementation of the blockade of Zhenhai Port, all ships except the Gaodeng have been anchored outside Zhenhai Port, and passengers and cargo are transported in and out by barges. Unfortunately, the Jingsheng barge carrying passengers suddenly capsized the day before (the 2nd), drowning hundreds of people, which is a tragic incident unprecedented. It was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The details are as follows:

Situation of the Barge

The Moufu ship of the Shanghai Yihe Foreign Company Shipping Department, after opening from Shanghai to Ningbo a few days ago, was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 28th of last month. However, due to strong winds and waves, the date was temporarily changed, and it opened to Shanghai on the evening of the 2nd. All the goods had been transported by barge from Ningbo in succession. On the morning of the day before (the 2nd), another batch of passengers was carried by the Jingsheng small boat to the Moufu ship outside Zhenhai Port.

A Glimpse of the Tragic Teacher

At 1:30 p.m. on the same day, the Jingsheng ship was planning to carry the second batch of passengers to the exit. At around 2 p.m., the ship was fully loaded with passengers, totaling more than 400 people. At that time, the Japanese planes were harassing the sky, and the Benbo air defense sentry issued an emergency alarm. The sound of the Japanese planes was clearly audible, causing public panic and the entire ship to be in turmoil. When the bow of the Jingsheng ship was leaving the Jiangbei shore port, the ship was in an outward state. The passengers had previously been bombed by Japanese planes on small boats between Ningbo and Yao, resulting in heavy casualties. In order to avoid repeating the same mistakes, they tried to flee, and the tilt became even worse. Although the boatmen tried their best to save it, it was still ineffective and eventually capsized. The ship entered the water and immediately sank, and soon the entire ship sank into the water.

Rescue Process

At that time, the alarm had not yet been lifted, so except for a few police boatmen near the ship who heard the news and came to the scene to bravely rescue, the people on the ship were all in the air raid shelter and did not know the situation. When the alarm was lifted at 2:22 p.m., all parties received the news and rushed to the scene of the accident to assist in the rescue. Yin County Head Yu and other officials went to the scene of the accident to inspect and comfort the families of the distressed passengers. As of 6 p.m. on the same day, only 43 passengers and more than 20 drowned bodies had been recovered. They are now placed near the Jiangbei shore railway station, waiting for family members to identify them. The whereabouts of the remaining 200 passengers are still unknown, and there is no hope of survival. These people are all from Ningbo and Shao counties, and some are transferred from the mainland to Ningbo to Shanghai.

Moufu Returns to Shanghai

The Moufu ship has now been postponed until last night to return to Shanghai from Zhenqi due to the tragic accident. It is expected to enter the port this morning and dock at the Bund Garden Pier. The 43 passengers who were rescued also hired a boat to Zhenhai Port to take the ship to Shanghai.

### Public Buses Resumed Yesterday - Conditions to be Discussed Today - Mr. Yu Qiaqing Said That a Solution is Expected - All Vehicles on All Routes Will Run This Morning

After the workers of the British China General Omnibus Company went on strike, through the mediation of Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Public Works Department, the workers accepted the advice and resumed work yesterday morning. The conditions put forward by the workers will be negotiated today. Yesterday, routes 1, 9, 10, 14, and 15 resumed operation. Starting this morning, it can be completely restored. The details are as follows:

Accept Advice

The Public Motor Vehicle Industry Trade Union of the Third District issued a notice to the striking workers, accepting Mr. Yu‚Äôs advice to resume work first. At 6 a.m. yesterday, there were more than 300 drivers, ticket sellers, and coppersmiths standing in front of the company's factory gate at No. 1171 Kang Nai Tuo Road, watching. After the persuasion of Ma Xincheng, an investigator from the Political Department of the Public Works Department, and Zhang Delan (British), the general manager of the company's vehicle affairs, they did not enter the factory to resume work until 8:30 a.m. The company has deployed vehicles to restore the operation of public buses.

Restore Traffic

Yesterday, due to the incomplete number of workers resuming work, the Public Motor Vehicle Company first restored the operation of public buses on routes 1, 9, and 10 at 9 a.m. A total of 24 vehicles on Route 1, from Zhaofeng Park to the Bund on Beijing Road, 19 vehicles on Route 9, from Zhaofeng Park to the Bund, 38 vehicles on Route 10, from Caojiadu to the Bund, 16 vehicles on Route 14, from Daxilu Dunxin Road to the Bund, and 8 vehicles on Route 15, from Fuxu Road Tongfu Road to the Bund, a total of 105 vehicles. About 75% of the workers have resumed work.

Company Apologizes

A reporter from Xinsheng News learned from the company yesterday that, regarding the resumption of public bus operation, in addition to routes 1, 9, 10, 14, and 15 yesterday, routes 2, 5, 7, 12, and 17 will be completely restored starting today, and the vehicle and machine workers can also completely resume work. The company expressed its deep regret for the unfortunate strike event, which caused temporary traffic disruption. As for the temporary fares for public buses on routes 1 and 9 during the workers' strike, they have been canceled yesterday.

Continue Petition

The workers said that this resumption of work was purely to respect Mr. Yu‚Äôs advice and take care of social order. Therefore, they are determined to continue to argue for their demands. After the workers' meeting of various departments was held the night before, it was decided to discuss the 13 demands one by one, modify them, and change them to the minimum demands. At 2 p.m. yesterday, six representatives were sent to the Sanbei Company to pay a visit to Mr. Qiaqing to petition. Mr. Yu personally met them. The workers' representatives first thanked Mr. Yu and reported the progress of the resumption of work. Finally, they put forward the modified minimum demands and urged Mr. Yu to quickly mediate a satisfactory solution. At the same time, some workers were arrested and have not been released yet, and they also requested that they be released first. Mr. Chu expressed his pleasure to the workers for following the advice to resume work, and said that the items raised were all reasonable and that he would be responsible for negotiating a solution with the company and bailing out the arrested persons. The representatives were satisfied and withdrew.

Mediation This Morning

According to Mr. Chu Qiaqing, the British public bus workers' strike was caused by the request for improved treatment. Fortunately, after my persuasion, all workers have resumed work this morning (that is, yesterday), which shows that the workers can take care of the overall situation and strictly abide by the order. I am deeply pleased. Now I have decided to go to the company with Mr. Li Fuxun on this morning to visit Mr. Shaw, the general manager, to discuss a solution, because Mr. Li is also a Chinese director of the company. Although there are as many as 13 demands put forward by the workers, the main ones are actually the issues of increasing wages and rice subsidies. The company has already expressed its acceptance in principle on this point, and there should be no difficulty. However, the preconditions are the release of the arrested workers and no dismissal of workers. Ming Nong has decided to do it first, and then negotiate the remaining items. I deeply hope that if both parties can understand each other with sincerity, a satisfactory solution will be obtained.

### Shanghai Post Office Suspends Receiving Nanchang Mail

Any Letters are Suspended Temporarily

The Shanghai Postal Administration suddenly issued a notice to all branches yesterday that any mail sent to Nanchang's port will be suspended from receiving and sending, and remittances are also ordered to be suspended. According to the local situation, if there is something special, such as sending ordinary letters, registered mail, and express mail, the post office will accept it and try to send it to the nearest post office. Except for the war, the post office has never suspended receiving mail. Letters sent to Nanchang's port are temporarily suspended from delivery to avoid delays. Also, it is known that Yangzhong remittances are also temporarily suspended.

### The Authorities of the Two Concessions Strictly Supervise the Rice Market - The Daily Sales Volume of the Market is Reported Daily - If There is Any Further Refusal, It Will Be Dealt With According to Law

Shanghai Rice Company Tea Association Market Management Committee, Announcement No. 124, "The case is based on the notification from the Public Concession Public Works Bureau and the French Concession Public Works Bureau that the daily sales volume of the market must be reported on a daily basis according to the number to facilitate statistics, etc. It is found that this daily report has been notified and urged to fill in and submit it many times. Now, based on the aforementioned reasons, a special announcement is issued again, requesting all colleagues to comply with it and not violate it. "According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the association has already discussed the method of daily reporting of the total sales volume and announced its implementation. However, each of the market shops has refused to make a report, so the daily sales volume of the market cannot be known. Now, in addition to complying with the order, the association also stipulates that regardless of whether the goods are sold to customers or stores, stores sell to stores, they must comply with the scope of their business, and only real transactions are allowed. No blank sales or purchases are allowed. Once a transaction is made, the specified transaction voucher (that is, the transaction slip) must be used to be a formal transaction. If there is a breach of contract after the deadline, each party shall submit the transaction certificate to facilitate acceptance and disposal. It has been stipulated that "the seller of rice must first issue a consignment note to the buyer, and the buyer must issue a consignment note to the seller before this transaction can be considered established. If a broker is involved, a broker's note must be added. In case of return, the consignment note must be returned to cancel it."

Stop Profiteering From Purchasing Rice at Par Price

Cha Boxchen sent a letter to the Flour Industry Par Price Committee, "Your committee sells flour at par price for the purpose of helping the poor. This is a sincere act. However, the method of limiting each person to buy one package is not perfect. It is heard that unscrupulous people are taking advantage of this to make a profit. Each package is priced at 10 yuan and 3 cents. The unscrupulous people buy it and resell it to others, earning 13 yuan, which can earn a profit of 2 yuan and 7 cents. At first, only one or two people started it, but recently it has become more and more serious. The funds for helping the poor are actually used by these people to hoard and make a profit. It is better to sell each package in small pieces, and each person can only buy one yuan. To avoid crowding when buying, the flour should be divided into ten packages per package before buying. Although it is a drop in the bucket, the general poor people can benefit more, and the unscrupulous people can disappear from now on. I hope you will observe and implement it and ask for the life of the majority of the poor."

### Second Day of Coal Briquette Flat Sale: Xieyuan Coal Briquette Store Resumed Flat Sales Yesterday; Hot Water Industry Held General Meeting to Discuss Future Measures

After the Shanghai Coal Briquette Flat Sale Committee began flat sales of coal briquettes on the 2nd of this month, yesterday was the second day. Despite the drizzling rain and muddy roads, ordinary people seeking to purchase briquettes still flocked to it like ducks. Flat sales began at 2 PM, and the stock was sold out in no time. It is estimated that over 40,000 ordinary people purchased briquettes. The Xieyuan store at No. 14 Connaught Road, corner of Hardoon Road, which had previously refused to sell briquettes, resumed flat sales yesterday after widespread criticism. According to a report from the industry association, Kunyuanxing Coal Store at No. 206 Ximen Road, location 21, was originally assigned to sell 40 dan of flat-priced briquettes daily. However, because there were fewer impoverished people in that area, 20 dan will be transferred from there to Xieyuan Coal Store at No. 270 Quai de Zikawei for flat sales, designated as location 27.

Hot Water Industry Plans for Future Measures

More than 500 member businesses of the Hot Water Industry Association were granted permission by the Shanghai Coal Industry Association to purchase inexpensive coal dross for fuel, limited to one ton per business, at a discounted price of 98 yuan per ton. Since applications for coal purchases began on February 24th, the period has now ended (a fixed period of 10 days). After receiving the inexpensive coal dross, all hot water stores have resumed water sales. However, they are all enduring sacrifices and still selling water at the association's agreed-upon market price. The industry association is currently investigating stores that have unilaterally raised prices, selling each ladle for one cent, and will impose penalties to warn others. Recognizing that the current coal supply of one ton per business is merely a drop in the bucket, and will be exhausted in a few days, the industry association has scheduled a general meeting of all member representatives for 9 AM tomorrow (the 5th) at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Yu Qiaqing Road to discuss appropriate measures. In addition to reporting on association affairs, the meeting will discuss the entire fuel issue for the industry. It is said that Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lvdeng, and Jiang Yanfang have been invited and are expected to attend for guidance.

Statement from Small Briquette Factories

Yesterday, Lin Hongjun sent a letter stating: "Having read in your newspaper on the 3rd of this month the letter from the Coal Briquette Association investigating 'the ten articles of appeal from small coal briquette factories as published in your newspaper, members of Huachengyuan, Huaxin, and other factories who attended the meeting stated that they were unaware,' which is astonishing. Upon investigation, the original manuscripts of appeals from the small factories all bear seals. How can it be said that they were unaware? Regarding the case of letters sent to the three companies, the facts were clear at the time. There were no seventeen factory representatives who requested it. When the manuscript was delivered to the small coal briquette factories, they all said that we, as coal briquette factories, are negotiating with raw material suppliers and should not be limited to the two companies. This time, the industry published an appeal, and nominated me as the representative, hence the above statement." At a time when the fuel problem in Shanghai is attracting attention from all sides, regardless of the size of the coal briquette factories and raw material suppliers, they should work together harmoniously and think of the general public. Now that the price assessment in the two concessions is about to be implemented, merchants should voluntarily supply at lower prices in advance to meet the urgent needs of society. Mutual evasion is of no help to the facts.

### Another American Nominee for Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council: Jardine Matheson Manager Keswick

The current Chairman of the Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, wishes to disengage from everything and return to commerce. Therefore, he has expressed his unwillingness to seek re-election in the next election. The American community has already nominated Messrs. Carna and McDonald as candidates. According to inquiries made by our news agency reporters to well-informed sources, Mr. W.J. Kesivick, manager of Jardine Matheson & Co., is also a highly promising candidate in the upcoming election and is now one of the nominees.

### Speculative Activities Showing Signs of Abating

Price Monitoring Proves Effective

Since the French Concession's Municipal Council and the Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council successively established committees to study prices, investigate supply and demand, and closely monitor market transactions to prevent speculation and manipulation, the activities of unscrupulous merchants have slightly abated. Some have shifted their focus to items such as cloth, yarn, and cotton, continuing to pursue illegitimate profits. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in consultation with the Shanghai Municipal Council and relevant industry associations, has implemented flat sales of flour and coal briquettes, which has been widely praised by the public. The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association is actively ordering foreign rice, and the flat rice sales committee is also planning long-term flat sales to benefit ordinary citizens, which is particularly welcome. Therefore, the rise in prices of various essential goods has been effectively curbed. The public generally believes that if the authorities of the two concessions and various public organizations can consistently and rigorously implement price supervision policies and work together, it will not be difficult for prices to gradually return to a stable and normal level. The 15th and 37th branch associations of the Shanghai Special Municipality have suggested to the People's Food Adjustment Association to apply for a statutory foreign exchange to order flat-sale foreign rice, and the association has transferred it to the flat rice sales committee for review and handling.

### Peace in the Four Villages of Datuan Township

Datuan Township in Nanhui is commercially prosperous and has many wealthy households. Previously, it was occupied by individuals falsely claiming to be part of a special operations team, kidnapping people for ransom, causing unrest and resentment among the residents. Since Han Hongsheng managed the local militia, the area has gradually become more peaceful. However, his influence is limited, and bandits run rampant in the four villages, causing those with some assets to take refuge in the town. It is now reported that measures are being taken to eliminate them.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Budget for This Year: Library

The library's budget for this year totals 40,040 yuan, an increase of 2,090 yuan from the previous year. Among them, "Salaries and Allowances" increased by 8,250 yuan, "Travel Expenses" decreased by 2,840 yuan, "Medicines" increased by 160 yuan, "Electricity and Telephone" increased by 510 yuan, "Printing, Stationery, Books, Newspapers, and Magazines" increased by 6,900 yuan, "Maintenance and Miscellaneous Items" increased by 280 yuan, and "Reserves" increased by 500 yuan. On the revenue side, subscription fees for books are expected to increase by 1,700 yuan.

The reasons for the increases and decreases in the above items are largely similar to those in other areas.

Books: The expenditure for purchasing new books this year totals 10,000 yuan, an increase of 3,000 yuan from the previous year. The expenditure for purchasing Chinese books still accounts for 20% of the total. In addition, the measure stipulated in last year's budget to allocate an additional 1,000 yuan to purchase books suitable for Chinese readers will continue to be implemented this year. Furthermore, the subscription fee rates for books will remain the same as last year and will not be increased.

The above budget was approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Library Committee at a meeting held on the 13th of last month. Besides necessary adjustments by the Treasurer in consultation with the Library Director, it was approved for submission to the Finance Committee for review. At the same time, the following two suggestions were resolved: (1) The expenditure for purchasing new books this year should be increased to 20,000 yuan. (2) It is stipulated that each subscriber will only be allowed to borrow two books and one magazine at a time in the future.

### Rules Issued by Chamber of Commerce for Non-Members to Obtain Certificates of Origin for National Goods

(2) If non-member factories and shops wish to request the Chamber to issue lists of certificates of origin for national goods, the Chamber will, for the convenience of assessing the production dynamics of each factory, still adhere to the principle of encouraging them to join the Chamber in accordance with regulations. (3) If non-member factories and shops with capital of more than 2,000 yuan are unable to bear the Chamber's membership fees but need to request the Chamber to issue lists of certificates of origin for national goods, they should first submit a statement of national goods matters, and seek a reputable company or firm to stamp the end of the form to certify it. After the Chamber verifies the facts, the matter will be processed. (4) If the non-member factories and shops in the preceding paragraph already have a union or association, the organization should affix its seal, and the person in charge should sign and stamp it to assume the responsibility of certification. (5) The non-member factories and shops in the preceding paragraph must pay a handling fee to the Chamber for requesting a list of certificates of origin for national goods, which is two yuan per list. (6) If the non-member factories and shops in the preceding paragraph expect brisk sales and find it cumbersome to pay a handling fee each time, they may pay in advance once a year, with an amount of 50 yuan. If there is a shortfall, there is no need to make up for it. (7) These rules are submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for future reference and amendment.

### Fashion Company Employee Accused of Framing Young Woman for Theft; False Imprisonment of Four Months; Appeal Results in Acquittal

Fang Xiuying (also known as Fang Ruiying), a 19-year-old female student from Qunhua School on Rue Lubin, residing at No. 116 Xu Jia Hui Road, at the home of her brother-in-law Sun Guisheng. In addition to running the Sun Dalu Powder Shop, Sun also operates the Tongtaichang Laoda Fang and other tea and pastry businesses, leading a modest life. On December 14th of last year, at 7 PM, Fang, carrying 51 yuan in legal tender, went with her classmate Yang Cai Zhen to the Hongxiang Fashion Company on Nanjing Road to purchase a coat. Yang left Hongxiang beforehand, while Fang was alone selecting a coat. Hongxiang employees, seeing Fang in student attire, dressed plainly, and wearing one coat and holding another, both of which were expensive items, suspected Fang of being a thief and reported her to the police, who arrested her and took her to the Old Zha Gate Police Station. Based on the Hongxiang employee's testimony, the police charged Fang with theft and brought her to the First Special Court. After trial, the court sentenced Fang to four months in prison. After the verdict, Fang's brother-in-law, Sun Guisheng, believed that his sister-in-law had been wrongly convicted. He pointed out that she usually had five fashionable coats of her own and that her family was quite wealthy, so there was no reason for her to steal. He requested assistance from the Taizhou Native Place Association in Shanghai. The association commissioned legal counsel, attorney Xu Wufang, to handle the appeal. Xu gathered various witnesses and material evidence to prove that Fang had been wrongly accused, and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The Second Branch of the High Court, presided over by Criminal Division Chief Judge Zhou Han, held a hearing. After the defense by police attorney Gan Jingxian and attorney Xu Wufang, the court declared the debate closed. Yesterday, Judge Zhou announced the verdict: The original verdict was overturned, and Fang Xiuying was found not guilty.

### Gang Schemes to Purchase Goods by Telephone; Package of Medicines Robbed

The Shanghai New Drug Industry Association notified its members yesterday: "Southeast Drug Store has sent a letter stating, 'At 2 PM today (the 2nd), our store was delivering a package of goods to No. 16 Dongxing Inn in Baoyu Lane, Xinqiao Street. Unexpectedly, there were three thugs hiding in the room. When our deliveryman delivered the medicines, they pretended to inspect them. Then, using the strength of three people, they violently robbed the package of medicines and fled without a trace. The details of the stolen package are as follows: (1) One box of 50 ampules of 0.45 Bayer Neosalvarsan; (2) One box of 50 ampules of 0.60 Bayer Neosalvarsan; (3) Six bottles of 500 tablets of Double Peach Brand Quinine; (4) One box of 0.5% 25x500 Chinese Drug Yishou Flavine Injection. The above four items were ordered in advance by telephone, falsely claiming to be from a drug store in another location. The address given previously (i.e., No. 16 Dongxing Inn) was to be sent for payment. We never expected them to harbor such malicious intentions. We hereby inform you so that you may inform all members that if anyone offers to sell the above-mentioned drugs, please immediately notify Southeast Drug Store by telephone at 96565-94123 and please notify them promptly.'

### Salvation Army: A Savior for the Poor

‚Äî Da Tong

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) A cold wave has hit Shanghai. Many refugees and beggars in this "isolated island" are suffering from cold and starvation. This is a major disaster. The number of frozen corpses collected daily by charitable organizations is shockingly high!

Since the Salvation Army began providing hot meals and cotton clothing in this area, this charitable organization has attracted admiration and attention from the outside world. To understand the work of the Salvation Army, our reporter specifically visited Brigadier B. Morris, the district commander of the Salvation Army in Shanghai, who warmly welcomed him and told him many things.

The main work of the Salvation Army is originally to propagate religion. However, their scope of work has long been expanded to become a well-organized charitable organization. At the same time, the implementation of all social charity work is without any boundaries; there are no limits of color, creed, and nationality. Since the retreat of the national army to the west, Shanghai has formed an "isolated island," the number of refugees has gathered, and the number of poor people has increased sharply. Therefore, their relief work has become more arduous.

The person in charge of the Salvation Army in Shanghai is District Commander Brigadier B. Morris, Deputy District Commander Major Baker (now in Chongqing doing relief work), and Colonel David McDavid, as well as several Chinese male and female "officers." As a result of their hard work and the achievements of many arduous tasks, this work has been gradually unfolded smoothly.

From the outbreak of the Shanghai war until September of last year, the Salvation Army managed the first, second, fourth, and fifth refugee camps, housing 65,972 homeless refugees. There were also beggar camps, housing 7,136 beggars covered in sores and ragged clothes. Children's hospitals and orphanages also housed 301 sick and impoverished children. A total of 201,300 meals were provided. Currently, there are 73,000 refugees in their various camps, living a happy and peaceful life under protection.

Last year, the Salvation Army's unemployment relief achievements broke previous records: a total of 6,431 applicants were received (including 34 nationalities), and 367 single men and women and 182 families were assisted. In addition, they also run the Westerners' Dormitory at No. 180 Xiamen Road and the Xinmin Fucheng Society. The former houses Westerners from the lower classes of Shanghai; the latter is a community that educates and helps offenders who have just been released from prison. They also send personnel from time to time to visit prisoners detained in Chinese and Western prisons, which has been very effective in changing people's hearts and customs.

There is also the Salvation Army's Rickshaw Drivers' Association on Xiamen Road, which is a public welfare organization for rickshaw drivers. In the past year (1939), it has done a lot of good for rickshaw drivers. 28,500 people received food from the association, 63,000 gallons of hot tea were distributed in the summer, 398 pairs of rubber-soled shoes were distributed, and more than 9,500 sick rickshaw drivers were treated.

Recently, the Salvation Army, in view of the rising prices and the hardships of the poor in this area, and especially the plight of the homeless refugees and beggars wandering the streets struggling on the line of starvation, began on January 25th to send vehicles loaded with hot rice and salted vegetables every night to the central area of the concession, distributing them to the impoverished people in need of relief. The kindness and generosity are, of course, very welcome. This hot meal relief work has had a significant effect.

In order to promote the work, the Salvation Army launched a fundraising campaign, and many Chinese and Western people have generously donated in recent days. At the same time, they are urgently hoping that all sectors will enthusiastically continue to do so.

(Another News) Recently, the weather in this area has been changeable. A few days ago, the sun shone brightly, as if entering the spring warmth; unexpectedly, in recent days, the sky has been overcast, the temperature has dropped, ice and snow have fallen, and the weather has suddenly become cold. As a result, the number of beggars who have frozen to death reported in the newspapers has increased again. The local Salvation Army, feeling the tragedy of those who have frozen to death, sent out several cars from 10 PM on the 1st of this month, scattering them in the various wharves and streets of this area. Lieutenant Colonel Tamado Batani led a large team to the streets and alleys to investigate refugees and beggars who were suffering from the cold, and distributed cotton clothes to keep them warm. It is said that more than 400 white cotton clothes were distributed that night, which is truly good news for the general public. It is said that the army will continue to carry out the work depending on the situation.

### Hunger and Cold Drive One to Risk; Caught Breaking the Law, Requesting Lenience; Sentence Reduced to Three Years on Appeal

Xin Weigen from Ningbo, 24 years old, received a secondary education. Because he was unemployed, he lodged in dormitory No. 14 of the Ningbo Native Place Association. Recently, he has become increasingly impoverished and unable to make a living.

He had a sudden change of heart and bought a fake pistol from Wing On Company. At 6:15 PM on November 27th of last year, he carried the fake pistol and went alone to the home of Tian Dafu, residing at No. 7 Baoxing Village, Shanhai Pass Road. He knocked on the door and entered, showing the weapon, scaring the occupants into silence. He robbed them of jewelry and cash worth about 4,000 yuan. As he was about to flee with the stolen goods, someone reported him to the police, who dispatched detectives to the scene, arrested Xin, and took him to the First Special Court along with the fake pistol and all the stolen goods. After interrogation, the court sentenced Xin to five years in prison. However, Xin was dissatisfied with the verdict and hired attorneys Fan and Qian Xingzhong to file an appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. The grounds for his appeal were: Xin Weigen is only 24 years old, received a secondary education, and has always been law-abiding. He originally worked at Xie Feng Electrical Materials Store in Hongkou. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he worked at Ningbo Xinbaohua Silk and Satin Bureau and was highly valued by the owner. However, Ningbo is located at the coast and has been repeatedly bombed by airplanes, causing Xinbaohua to be unable to operate and close down. The appellant also lost his job as a result. He then bought a boat to come to Shanghai and looked for relatives and friends everywhere, but could not find a place to eat. In this situation, he could not live or die. Under the pressure of hunger, cold, and various stimuli, his mentality suddenly changed. He disregarded everything, took a risk, and mistakenly broke the law. After committing the crime, the appellant deeply regretted it. Although he should be subject to a considerable sentence under the law, the original trial imposed a heavy sentence of five years, which seems excessive and difficult to accept. Therefore, he has filed a special request for a reduction in the sentence. The case has been reviewed by the Appeal Court, presided over by Zhou Han, together with Judge Liu Shi. After the trial concluded, the verdict was announced. The main text was: The original verdict is overturned, and Xin Weigen is sentenced to three years of imprisonment for nighttime intrusion and robbery. The fake pistol is confiscated. The reasons for reducing the sentence were: The appellant was forced by poverty and committed the crime by chance. He acted alone and did not collude with others. Although the amount of stolen goods was large, it was recovered at the time, and the victims did not suffer any losses. His criminal circumstances are not without excuse.

### Bomb Explodes in Xilaiment Gambling Den; Three Gamblers Injured

In the badlands of Western Shanghai, gambling dens are everywhere, numbering in the dozens, and business is booming. At around 8 PM last night, on the side of the small tables downstairs in the Xilaiment gambling den at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Daxilu, someone suddenly threw a bomb. There was a loud explosion, shaking the doors and windows. Iron fragments scattered, smoke filled the air, and three male and female gamblers were injured, falling to the ground, bleeding and groaning. It is reported that Li Bingqing, a 38-year-old man from Pudong, was seriously injured in the chest, legs, and feet. He lives at No. 19, C, Shanzhong Road. He Yulian, a 23-year-old woman, who lives at No. 212 Pinzhen Lane, Julai Da Road, injured her right leg. Wang Gu Shi, an old woman from Pudong, 43 years old, injured her foot. She resides in room 53 of the Shanghai Taiwan Hotel on Zhejiang Road. After the incident, the police from the Concession Police Station were the first to hear the alarm, and dispatched many detectives to suppress the situation and investigate the source of the bomb. By that time, the bomber had already slipped away. Before long, the pseudo-police also dispatched pseudo-police to the scene. The Concession police officers immediately returned by car because the area belonged to the extra-settlement road area. As for the three injured men and women, the pseudo-police sent them to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment by car. According to the doctor, Li Bingqing's chest was severely injured in the explosion, and his life is in danger.

### From Foreign Exchange Speculation to Soaring Prices and the Problem of Suppressing Them

‚Äî Xiao Guanyao

Amidst the frequent reports of victories from our front lines and the imminent establishment of Sino-American loans, the foreign exchange market has experienced a strange contraction. From February 12th to 17th, the US dollar exchange rate shrank from 7.063 to 6.563, causing prices to skyrocket. What are the factors behind this? Let me summarize them:

(1) The influx of a large amount of foreign exchange from North China hasÊøÄËµ∑speculation among Shanghai foreign exchange speculators, which is one of the reasons for the contraction of foreign exchange in Shanghai.

(2) Speculators, influenced by psychological factors, are constantly absorbing foreign exchange. Recently, some Shanghai banks have adopted a method that allows the buying and selling of foreign exchange with a certain amount of‰øùË≠â. Small salary earners, unable to cope with rising prices, are willing to take out some‰øùË≠âÈáë to try their hand at foreign exchange speculation. As a result of this herd mentality, the demand for foreign exchange has increased sharply, leading to a contraction in foreign exchange. This is the second reason.

(3) Merchants, seeing the contraction of foreign exchange, are forced to buy in advance if they need foreign exchange, which further exacerbates the contraction. This is the third reason.

(4) Due to the contraction of foreign exchange, prices have skyrocketed, especially for essential goods. The price of foreign rice has broken the 50 yuan mark, and the price of coal is more than ten times the normal price, which is a serious oppression for ordinary people and a serious threat to social order. The working class earns one yuan a day and cannot afford a full meal. According to today's (19th) newspaper, more than 500 people have starved to death on the streets of Shanghai in the last five days (from February 14th to 18th). This is truly a human tragedy!

The reason for the rise in prices is not only related to foreign exchange. Furthermore, one reason is that the situation in Shanghai is special, and the political power of our government cannot reach it for the time being, which givesÂ•∏ÂïÜ an opportunity to exploit. Another reason is that people are panicking, fearing that prices will rise indefinitely, so they are scraping together their savings to hoard goods to prepare for the future. When every household does this, the amount is considerable, which greatly reduces the supply of essential goods in the market. Moreover, the Shanghai industrial area has suffered from the war, production has decreased, and the population of Shanghai has increased compared to before the war. Therefore, based on the inability to adjust supply and demand, prices have risen again and again over time.

As far as I can see, foreign exchange is contracting due to speculation, but once speculators release their foreign exchange and the political, military, and diplomatic situation in our country improves day by day, the situation will definitely tend to stabilize.

In terms of prices, judging from the precedents of various countries in wartime, the rebound is always slower, so it is not as drastic as the fluctuation of foreign exchange.

However, the soaring prices in Shanghai today cannot be allowed to continue. I hope that the authorities will adopt effective measures and implement them conscientiously.

(1) Please ask theÂ∑•ÈÉ®Â±Ä, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and various public organizations to immediately form a price stabilization committee to stabilize prices.

(2) Please ask various public organizations and associations to work with theÂ∑•ÈÉ®Â±Ä to adopt the method of collective purchase of essential goods as much as possible. If funds are insufficient, please ask the banking industry to raise funds. If it is possible to slightly increase the purchase and storage of the current required quantity to prevent future problems, it would be even better. For the foreign exchange required for procurement, it is hoped that the central government can give a higher price for settlement.

(3) It is hoped that the banking industry will urge customers who have pledged essential goods to redeem them as soon as possible.

(4) On the other hand, thoroughly investigate the amount of essential goods stored in warehouses throughout Shanghai, and limit the time for them to be released. Otherwise, the court will evaluate the value of the hoarded goods based on the purchase price, and the banking industry will raise funds to purchase them.

(5) Please ask all Shanghai newspapers to publish the names and resumes of theÂ•∏ÂïÜ who are reported by the court for hoarding goods at any time, so that they will be despised by the Chinese people and subject to public opinion sanctions.

Today, the prices in Shanghai have reached a point where people cannot make a living. Public organizations and institutions cannot turn a blind eye. In addition to hoping that they will take the above-mentioned effective measures to suppress prices, it is also hoped that general manipulators can have a great awakening, not exceeding the profit above the condemnation of conscience. It is hoped that general asset holders and the industrial sector can "go to the inland!" Then, Shanghai's banking industry can also invest as much as possible in the southwest and northwest with general customers, so that the floating capital that floods Shanghai can be used for speculation, and the situation where it has a hundred disadvantages and no advantages for people's livelihood will not be repeated, and the development of inland resources can also be relied upon, and the rejuvenation of the nation can also be greatly assisted.

### An Economic Overview of the New Turkey

‚Äî Translated by Caohuo

With the development of the European situation, Turkey's position is becoming increasingly important. This article aims to explain the various economic indicators related to Turkey's national power. It is sufficient for us to more easily understand why this important new Turkey is important, not only because of its important geographical location, but also because of its great achievements in the sixteen years since its founding, it is worthy of an important position.

Turkey is a vast country. It covers an area of 772,340 square kilometers and has a population of over 17 million. Seventy-six percent of the population are farmers.

A. Agriculture

During the Ottoman Empire, Turkey needed to import a huge amount of food every year; but since the establishment of the Republic in 1923, as a result of the implementation of new economic policies, it has not only been able to supply the needs of the entire nation, but also exports a large amount of raw materials and manufactured goods abroad.

The following table shows a glimpse of its agricultural production increases: (Unit: 1,000 quintals)

B. Industry

In order to protect and nurture national industries, the Turkish Republican government, under Kemal Atat√ºrk, adopted a policy of protecting national industries. In 1927, there were only 470 factories in the country; but in 1931, thanks to government support, the number of factories in the country increased sharply to 1,988.

In order to promote industrialization, the Republican government has established several banks dedicated to supporting certain industrial sectors. Among them are Sumer Bank, Is Bank, and Eti Bank. Eti Bank specializes in supporting the mining industry.

Notable Turkish manufacturing industries include: the Kayseri Linen Factory, founded in 1935, which now produces 30 million meters of linen annually; the Tznnt Paper Mill, founded in 1932, which produces 11,000 tons annually; the Eregei-Zonguldak Coal Mine, which produced 597,000 tons in 1923, and increased to 2.5 million tons last year; and Turkey's four major sugar factories, which produced 572 tons in 1926, and increased to 65,856 tons in 1936.

This rapid industrial development is entirely due to the Turkish government's implementation of the first five-year plan; the plan began in 1934 and was completed last year. The most important and benefited industries are: textiles, mining, celluloid, glass, and chemicals.

The second five-year plan has already begun this year, with the aim of promoting the development of the gas industry, the oil refining industry, the coal industry, and the chemical industry. However, electrification and port construction will also be given attention, and the canning industry of fish, fruits, and vegetables will also be developed.

C. Domestic Commerce

Based on state-owned policies, the Republican government controls national commerce. Today, the Republican government has invested 48 million Turkish pounds in commerce. Moreover, investments in insurance, banking, and agriculture are not included.

D. Foreign Trade

Turkey's foreign trade adopts a free export system, but divides the countries of the world into dynamic groups. Imports are not restricted to countries with which there is a surplus or a commercial agreement. (Unit: millions of Turkish pounds)

Total Exports„ÄÄ„ÄÄ155„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ96„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ145

The main export commodities are: tobacco, wheat, livestock, metals, coal, cotton, barley, rye, wool, nuts, figs, olive oil, and raisins.

E. Finance

Due to the chaotic financial situation left over from the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish Republic was faced with the need to implement radical financial reforms from the beginning. The Ankara Parliament immediately promulgated a law prohibiting the raising of new debts to balance the budget. The oppressive taxes levied on farmers by the former empire were also abolished.

Despite the painful burden of repaying the debts of the former Ottoman Empire, the new Turkey still implemented a new and fair tax system. Since 1926, it has not needed to raise new debts and has been able to have balanced budget expenditures.

Tax revenue was 186 million Turkish pounds in 1931-32; 241 million in 1934-35; and 282 million in 1938-39.

F. Currency and Finance

Before World War I, the Ottoman Empire's currency system adopted a bimetallic standard. Coins were made of gold and silver, auxiliary coins were cast from other metals, and there were also banknotes. Ottoman Bank banknotes, in fact, circulated from 1863, but mainly only in commerce, and were rarely used by the general public.

In 1914, the coins circulating in the Ottoman Empire were estimated at 50 million Turkish pounds, while the circulating amount of Ottoman Bank banknotes was only 2 million Turkish pounds.

Like the belligerent countries during World War I, the Ottoman government also implemented an inflation policy to maintain its wartime finances. By the end of World War I, 158 million Turkish pounds of treasury bills had been issued. As a result, the value of the Turkish pound plummeted. In 1922, the exchange rate of the Turkish pound to the British pound was 7.28; in 1929, 11 Turkish pounds were needed to buy one British pound. At this time, the government intervened, and in 1930, a foreign exchange control policy was implemented. The exchange rate was fixed at 10.30 pounds.

In 1931, when Britain abandoned the gold standard in September, the Turkish pound was decoupled from the British pound and linked to the French franc at an exchange rate of 12.06 francs.

When the French franc was readjusted in value in 1936, the Turkish pound remained at its original gold value.

In 1930, the Parliament passed the law to establish a national issuing bank, which began operations with a capital of only 15 million Turkish pounds. The bank is responsible for issuing banknotes worth 150 million Turkish pounds; after that, it has continuously increased its gold reserves. The circulating amount of Turkish banknotes was 165 million Turkish pounds in 1930, decreased to 147 million in 1933, and increased again to 194 million in 1938.

At the same time, the government is constantly increasing its surplus reserves. In 1931, Turkey held 6,127 kilograms of gold; in 1933, 17,695 kilograms; in 1936, 21,000 kilograms; and last year, 24,000 kilograms, worth approximately 36.9 million Turkish pounds.

After the establishment of the Republic, national savings deposits have been increasing day by day. In 1924, the total amount of savings deposits of the Turkish people in various savings banks was 13 million Turkish pounds; in 1928, 78 million; in 1935, 138 million; and today, it has reached 170 million, with approximately 12 Turkish pounds of deposits per person.

### The Rising Tide of Japanese Currency

Japan's method of maintaining its finances is to borrow; the method of digesting public debt is to increase banknotes and issue bad checks (i.e., overdrawing loans from banks); Japanese prices are rising steadily under the dual pressure of material shortages and inflation; the more prices rise, the larger the amount of currency issued. Malignant inflation will undoubtedly become the tomb of Japan's wartime economy.

(Note) Unit: millions of Japanese yen, (1) Including domestic and foreign debt, (2) Excluding local public debt, (3) Including the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Taiwan, the Bank of Korea, and small banknotes, but excluding coinage.

### Discussion on "Preliminary Discussion on the Public Treasury Regulations"

‚Äî Wang Chengjie

Since the implementation of the Public Treasury Law, articles discussing it in various newspapers and magazines have sprung up like mushrooms after rain; but most of their content is an introduction to the content of the Public Treasury Law, and there are not many discussions on whether the various provisions of the Public Treasury Law are strict and appropriate. This journal's 306th issue published an article by Mr. Xia Bubo entitled "Preliminary Discussion on the Public Treasury Regulations," which carefully reviewed the content of our country's Public Treasury Law. The need for this type of article is more urgent than ordinary introductory texts; but Mr. Xia's original article's first point, regarding "Discussion on the Appropriation Notice," seems to misunderstand the provisions of Article 26 of the Implementation Rules of the Public Treasury Law (hereinafter referred to as the Implementation Rules).

The first half of the second section of Mr. Xia's original article states: "According to the provisions of the Implementation Rules, the bank or postal institution acting as the public treasury should, after receiving the payment order issued by the competent public treasury authority, transfer the amount from the total income deposit to the ordinary operating expense deposit account of the requesting agency, and issue an appropriation notice to the requesting agency. The receiving agency then fills out a receipt after receiving the payment order notice issued by the competent public treasury authority, and then claims it from the bank or postal institution acting as the public treasury (Articles 23, 24, and 26, paragraph 2 of this Implementation Rules). It is not explicitly stipulated in the law whether the receiving agency must fill out a receipt after receiving the appropriation notice from the acting bank before claiming it (the original text seems to be a mistake for the word 'ÂæÄ'), or whether the receipt of the appropriation notice is irrelevant." Upon investigation, in this explanation, the filling out of the appropriation notice by the bank or postal institution acting as the public treasury (hereinafter referred to as the acting public treasury bank or acting bank) and the filling out of the receipt by the receiving agency are regarded as being used within the claiming of the same expenses; but according to Articles 13, 14, 18, and 20 of the Public Treasury Law and Articles 23, 24, and 26 of the Implementation Rules, the appropriation notice is used when transferring from the total income deposit to the ordinary operating expense deposit, special fund deposit, or special deposit of assistance funds and subsidies with clearly defined purposes; and the receipt is used when the receiving agency directly claims funds from the acting public treasury bank; these two types of natures are different: one is applied when depositing and allocating funds, and the other is applied when withdrawing cash, and they do not need to be used together when depositing or claiming the same expenses.

According to the provisions of Articles 13, 18, and 20 of the Public Treasury Law, the expenditure of the total income deposit can be divided into two types: one is the expenditure of transferring from the total income deposit to the ordinary operating expense deposit and various deposits; the other is the public treasury expenditure of directly allocating payments from the total income final deposit to the receiving agency, or assisting and subsidizing the government. In fact, the former must be a transfer; the latter must be a cash expenditure in principle. The expenditure of transferring from the total income deposit to the ordinary operating expense fund or other funds should be carried out in accordance with Article 14 of the Public Treasury Law: "According to the approved distribution budget, the accounting agency shall notify the competent public treasury authority on a regular basis, together with the competent auditing agency, to notify the bank or postal institution acting as the public treasury to transfer from the total income fund to the ordinary operating expense deposit account according to the agency of expenses." This procedure should be initiated by the accounting agency first, and then by the competent public treasury authority. The competent public treasury authority should fill out a transfer payment order based on the notice of the accounting agency. After the order copy and the notice copy are sent to the competent auditing agency for countersigning, the order copy is sent to the acting public treasury bank, the notice copy is sent to the requesting agency, and the stub copy is kept for reference. After receiving the order copy of the transfer payment order, the acting public treasury bank should transfer the amount to the ordinary operating expense deposit and fill out an appropriation notice to send to the requesting agency. At this point, the appropriation procedure has come to an end. The requesting agency does not need to fill out a receipt. Therefore, Mr. Xia's original article's second point regarding the discussion on the appropriation notice is obviously not a problem. (Note: The original article has a more detailed explanation of the above two points; because the space in this journal is limited, it has been omitted, and I hope the author will understand.)

### Cost Estimate of 20-Count Yarn

‚Äî Long Jusheng

The price of goods, whether expensive or cheap; in addition to the supply and demand relationship, and the impact of whether there is hoarding and manipulation, is always inseparable from the basic level of cost issues. Since the beginning of the Lunar New Year, the sharp rise in various prices has been unexpectedly terrifying! Among them, rice, noodles (flour), wheat, yarn, and coal have risen the most! This is truly a major crisis in which the lives of ordinary people are severely threatened! I am speaking about yarn, so I will focus on the scope of the yarn market. Recalling that before the "August 13th" battle, a 22-count yarn sold for only 270-280 yuan, compared to the current 850-860 yuan, the percentage increase has reached 200% (more than twice that before the war). As far as the cost is concerned (the opening and payment fee for each yarn), it was only 30-40 yuan before the war. Now? The opening and payment for each yarn must be around 100 yuan. As for the cost of cotton, it was only about 175 yuan (per yarn) before the war, but now it costs about 710 yuan (excluding the income from by-products). The ratio of percentages? The difference is even greater. 20-count yarn is the hottest trading object on the market, so let's talk about the cost of 20-count yarn as follows:

The amount of cotton used for a 20-count yarn is mostly around 350 catties (pounds). The raw materials are nothing more than fine velvet cotton, Tongzhou cotton, Bailuo cotton, or some Huoqi cotton. The market price of fine velvet cotton is 213.50 yuan, the market price of Tongzhou cotton is 209.00 yuan, Bailuo cotton (currently out of stock) costs about 230.00 yuan (silk velvet is better). The Huoqi cotton is 196.00 yuan. The total price of cotton per 100 catties? It must be at least about 210.00 yuan, so if you multiply it by 350 catties, it will cost 735.00 yuan. Excluding the by-products (commonly known as scraps) of about 25 yuan per yarn, isn't the cost of cotton 710 yuan? In addition, the current opening and payment costs and increases are as follows:

The opening and payment fee is also related to the amount of production (number of yarns produced). It cannot be generalized and inflexibly. Of course, the average opening and payment fee is reduced with strong production, and vice versa. Although there are some ups and downs, the difference is not too great. According to my above-mentioned research, the current market price of 20-count yarn is about 840-850 yuan (it has been over 890 yuan), and what is its total cost? The cost of cotton is 710 yuan, and the opening and payment fee is 90 yuan, totaling 800 yuan. The difference from the market price is 40-50 yuan, which is the profit that the factory can obtain! If a day and night's work can produce 100 yarns, there is a profit of 4,000-5,000 yuan a day, which is quite impressive! Moreover, larger factories are more than that.

### Grains: The Rice Market Was Firm in the Morning and Weak in the Afternoon‚ÄîEnding Up Receding Slightly‚Äî

Since the rice market tightened previously, the minds of both floating hoards and retail households were firm yesterday morning. As soon as the market opened, there was a rush to buy, and the market appeared tight. Customer chants rose and fell. By mid-market, it was especially lively. The price of No. 1 Saigon reached a high of 49 yuan, and other fire-patterned spikes also shouted 48 yuan, which was about 2 yuan higher than the previous session. However, there was little real demand, all of which was psychological. The market has lacked a solid foundation for a long time, so it is difficult to sustain. Therefore, it weakened as soon as it moved, and the floating hoards returned to sell at high prices, forming more sales than purchases, and the market suffered a setback. By the afternoon market, it declined all the way, wiping out about 1 yuan of the morning's gains. The closing market prices were 48 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 45.8 yuan to 45 yuan for No. 2, 47 yuan to 46.5 yuan for fire-patterned, 43.5 yuan for small-grained, 43 yuan for Tokyo spires, and about 37.5 yuan for mixed crushed, only half a yuan higher than the previous market closing price. The glutinous rice and ÂΩìÊñØÊ¥ãÁ±≥, which were a sensation, also advanced together, but were particularly deserted, with few transactions. It is difficult for their market prices to be generally lower forË¥ß‰∏ª, and there has been no rise or fall, but the situation has become much softer. Although the source of thick and thin japonica rice and early and late rice in inland areas was continuous spring rain yesterday, it has not been seen to turn around, and the foreign ÊöóÂ∏Ç is still not open. The reason is nothing more than the expensive price, which is not easy for the general public to access, so the overall market has a tendency to loosen.

### Wuxi Rice and Paddy Are Flat

The Wuxi rice market has set up public sales for handlingÂπ≥‰ª∑È£üÁ±≥, which has been increased to fourteen locations. For days, the spring has been cold, and the rain and snow have not stopped. Generally, stores sell È´òÁôΩÁ≤≥ at 29 yuan per stone, which is quite quiet, so they replenish daily in the market. The appetite for raw materials has weakened. Paddy boats from neighboring counties and townships such as Wujin and Yixing have a slightly larger source. There are also warehouses hoarding households selling samples. After customers sell their goods at the market, they return to their hometowns to buy again. The price of paddy in the producing area has been affected and is trending downwards. It is profitable to transport, so in recent rice and tea meetings, the amount of rice and paddy sold has been nearly 10,000 per day. At present, in addition to the factories that are required by Japanese merchants to pay the weis, and the Âπ≥Á±≥È£üÁ±≥ sold by the eight sections arriving in the market daily to handle, other sales yards are limited, and the rice and paddy market is gradually flat. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, there were many paddy samples sold in the market, but only Taifeng bought 5,000 dan. With such smooth entry, either the daily sales of Japanese merchants will continue, or there will be a large amount of hoarding. According to the current situation, if there is no hoarding and speculation, even if a large number of Japanese merchants leave the country, the price of rice and paddy will not rise again. (Zhi)

### Sugar Market: Interruption of Raw Sugar Supply from Zhangzhou

Yesterday, the sugar market saw minimal fluctuations and remained generally stable. The Exchange set the benchmark price for spot raw white sugar at 62.70 yuan per picul, up 0.20 yuan. Newly arrived foreign raw white sugar was priced at 62.50 yuan, while older stock slightly softened to 62 yuan. Transshipments remained at 40 yuan. Taikoo granulated sugar was firm, with B mark eastern warehouse stock up 0.25 yuan to 65.65 yuan and western warehouse stock at 66 yuan. Other prices remained unchanged. H mark crude sugar from the western warehouse was 45 yuan, while the eastern warehouse price decreased by 0.05 yuan. Dutch crude MP mark was 47.20 yuan, and WA mark was 46.70 yuan, both up 0.20 yuan. Local refined white sugar and No. 1 ice sugar held their original prices. News circulated that Xinghua sugar production was increasing, making transactions difficult. Furthermore, transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu has been disrupted again since the 17th of last month, inevitably reducing the supply of raw sugar. Only 50 cases of Xinghua slab sugar were quoted, priced at 41.50 yuan.

### Dried Goods: White Lotus Seeds Increase by Ten Yuan

Recently, due to the lack of supply of white lotus seeds and gradually decreasing inventory, although fewer merchants have gone north to buy, the market price has risen. Yesterday's transaction price was 190 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the red market price. The remaining older stock varied in price from 140 to 150 yuan.

### Finance: Indian Silver Futures and Spot Prices Rise

According to a Reuters report from Bombay on the 2nd, the spot price of Indian silver rose by 5 annas, while futures for April and May both rose by 4 annas. Market conditions were stable. Prices for British and American silver remained unchanged during market closure.

### Textiles: Western-Style Woolens in Uniquely High Demand

Western-style suiting materials and woolens, including medium-thick serge, homespun, flannel, heavy cloth, spring overcoating, patterned tweed, cheviot, tropical worsted, smooth worsted stripes, checks, "ban si," twills, diagonal weaves, plain weaves, solid colors, and dotted patterns, were all in high demand yesterday. Large and small clothing shops along Avenue Joffre, Szechuan Road, and Great World Street were well-stocked. The most active sales were for materials priced from 13-14 yuan to 23-24 yuan. Currently, regardless of how low the quality of Western-style suiting materials and woolens may be, the cost per yard is no longer within 10 yuan. However, high-quality materials selling for over 30 yuan per yard were rare.

### Metals: American Narrow Strip Iron Continues to Rise

Due to brisk trading in the American iron market in recent days, the transaction price could not be stabilized. Seeing this, all traders increased prices. Yesterday, market conditions improved by another 4-5 yuan. Strip iron was selling for 110 yuan per 200 pounds, while the large-patterned iron required 120 yuan per case. The fine-patterned iron was quoted at over 100 yuan per 200 pounds. Yesterday, local cigarette factories, toy factories, printing factories, and canning factories purchased 300-400 cases. Demand from customers in Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and Fujian was also strong, making market conditions quite lively.

### Current Status of Compulsory Education Implementation in Zhejiang Province (1)

(Fangyan Correspondence) Xu Shaodi, the Director of the Department of Education of Zhejiang Province, recently wrote an article titled "Past and Present Status of Compulsory Education Implementation in Zhejiang Province," detailing the implementation of compulsory education in the province. An excerpt of the summary is as follows:

The implementation of compulsory education in Zhejiang Province can be divided into two periods, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan serving as the dividing line. Compulsory education before the war refers to the period from August 1935 to July 1937. During this time, the principle of equal emphasis on quality and quantity was adopted. Implementation matters were planned and considered comprehensively to minimize obstacles and facilitate progress. Key aspects are highlighted below:

(1) Establishment of Short-Term Small Schools and Classes: Regarding the establishment of short-term primary schools, the Department made decisions based on the reports of surveys on out-of-school children in various counties and referenced the national standard of reducing the number of out-of-school children by 80% within five years. In 1935, 1,326 short-term primary schools and 1,242 short-term primary school classes were established, accommodating 155,760 students. In 1938, there were 2,652 short-term primary schools and 2,984 short-term primary school classes, accommodating 311,510 students. In two years, a total of 3,978 short-term primary schools and 3,726 short-term primary school classes were established, accommodating 467,280 students, exceeding the planned standard. (According to the survey in 1935, the number of out-of-school children in the province was approximately 1,329,961. Reducing this number by 80% within five years required a reduction of 212,793 children each year, totaling 425,586 children in two years.) Some schools inevitably closed due to various reasons, but at least the overall result met the planned standard.

(2) Management of Compulsory Education Funds: There were three sources of compulsory education funds: central government subsidies, provincial government allocations, and self-raised funds from various counties. The first two sources were relatively stable. In 1935, the central government subsidized 130,000 yuan, and the provincial government allocated 140,000 yuan. In 1936, the central government subsidized 220,000 yuan, and the provincial government allocated 210,000 yuan. The situation with self-raised funds from various counties was much more complicated. In 1935, the provincial government did not stipulate a unified tax source, and each county acted independently. As a result, there were as many as 27 types of taxes, such as transfers from general reserve funds, old debt taxes, abolition of miscellaneous taxes and allocation of fees, school grain donations, fundraising, slaughter surtax, private donations, house tax, house rent, self-governance household donations, household donations, rectification of prostitution donations, property purchase donations, education surtax, Confucian temple surplus fees, defense household donations, household donations, land clearing, local public bond relief, ancestral cemetery property, school property, banquet donations, teahouse donations, amusement donations, contract verification surtax, land tax surtax, overdue fines, county reserve fund surcharges, fines, township apportionment, and mine revenue. However, these funds were small and fragmented, failing to meet the needs. A few impoverished counties relied solely on central and provincial subsidies to maintain appearances, and they reduced the establishment of short-term small schools and classes. Starting in 1936, the Department of Education, in light of past shortcomings, specially promulgated a method for counties and cities to increase compulsory education funding. In addition to stipulating that each county could levy an additional 10% to 35% of the self-governance household donations specifically for compulsory education funds, they could also apply for allocations from (1) land tax county tax overdue fines, (2) slaughter surtax, and (3) collection of old taxes (belonging to the county tax portion). After this rectification, the county self-raised portion of compulsory education funding gradually became standardized. (To be continued)

### General Boy Scout Association Celebrates Shanghai Service Personnel

### YMCA Holds Children's Music Competition: Outstanding Results Exceed Expectations, Champion Wu Yili is Only Eight Years Old

The Boys' Department of the Shanghai Chinese Christian Association YMCA, to promote musical development and talent, held the Shanghai Children's Music Competition at 7:30 PM on the 2nd at the assembly hall of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge. They invited renowned Chinese and Western musicians from the city, including Ding Shand, Li Huifang, Wu Leyi, Chen Youxin, Cao Cen, Zhang Yi, Dong Wang Ruixian, Zhang Junzhang, Si Yigui, Huang Yongxi, Xiang Fumei, and Dou Lixun, to form a judging committee of twelve people. Over eight hundred people attended. At 7:30 PM sharp, the competition began with an opening address by Chen, who used both Chinese and English to explain the purpose of the competition. The competition was divided into singing, violin, and piano categories, with a total of 36 participating children, including nine singers, five violinists, and twenty-three pianists. One child participated in both singing and violin. The youngest participant was five years old, and the oldest was thirteen. The competition was well-organized, and the children's excellent performance skills and proficiency were beyond everyone's expectations. The general level of performance was above average. However, it was regrettable that there were too few Chinese songs. Except for the "Banquiao Daqing" and "Fisherman's Song" in the singing category, the rest were Western classical pieces. In addition, there were four children who exceeded the age limit or whose participating categories were not within the association's scope, so they performed as demonstrations. Two performed violin, one performed accordion, and one performed musical saw. The twelve-year-old child Lu Liang, who performed the musical saw, was particularly praised by the audience for the novelty of the instrument. At the same time, the small orchestra of the Jingde Primary School Kindergarten performed the "Vienna March," and the Guangdong Shengfang Team performed the "Toy Symphony," which also added to the interest. After the competition, Ding Shande, a member of the judging committee, reported the results. He said that the competition results were excellent, but the judging was quite difficult because the differences were slight. After careful consideration, awards were given to four children, which was slightly different from the original plan. The first place was Wu Yili, eight years old, for piano performance. The second place was Zhang Yian, twelve years old, and the third place was Wang Zhilan, ten years old, both for piano performance. The fourth place was Liu Zhongchi, for violin performance, whose average score was originally the best, but because he was thirteen years old, exceeding the association's regulations, he was ranked fourth. Two children were also selected from singing and violin, but without prizes. The first place in singing was Liang Linwen, and the second place was Zhang Xianying. The first place in violin was still Liu Zhongchi, and the second place was Liang Zhiyong. Finally, Mrs. Wang Chuntao presented the awards, including a silver cup from Xiao Youmei, a silver cup from Lu Ganchen, two silver cups from the judging committee, and gift certificates from Robinson Piano Company for 40 yuan, Motuli Piano Company for 30 yuan, Leiluiluo Piano Company, and sheet music from Kainuo Piano Company.

### Student Unrest at the Tongwen Academy

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post*, the Japanese-language *Shanghai Mainichi Shinbun* reported today (the 3rd) that the Japanese-run Tongwen Academy is on the verge of student unrest due to the departure of six professors. The incident stems from a letter from the vice president of the academy stating that a certain Shanghai language professor had voluntarily resigned, resulting in the simultaneous departure of a total of six professors. The students of the academy, except for the freshmen, were indignant and submitted six demands yesterday (the 2nd), asking the academy to explain its treatment of the professors. The president claimed that the departing professors had other high-paying jobs. Tongwen Academy was previously located on Hongqiao Road, but its buildings were destroyed by fire. It now occupies the former site of Jiaotong University on Haig Road.

The Philippine National Baseball League Championship, which has been suspended for five years, is scheduled to resume on the 17th of this month. It is sponsored by the Philippine Sports Association. It is reported that at least ten teams will participate in this year's competition, including three teams from the southern islands, namely Cebu, Iloilo, and Negros. These three teams have average talent and strong strength. The Philippine Department of Education has indicated to the organizing agency that once the Philippine Inter-Secondary School Federation Games, which will be held in Cabanatuan City in Nueva Ecija province this week, conclude, it will select elite players from the participating provincial representative teams to form the Philippine Department of Education baseball team to prepare for participation in this year's Philippine National Baseball League. It is reported that the American Army and Navy troops stationed in the Philippines, who were previously dominant in the baseball scene in the Philippines, have been invited by the Philippine Sports Association to send teams to participate in the competition at that time. The Manila Bay Baseball League, which is currently competing for the championship, has a total of six teams. Although it has not yet concluded, it is expected that the players from these six teams will also participate in this year's Philippine National Baseball League. This year's league will be divided into two groups, with the winning teams from each group competing in a final for the championship. The Philippine National Baseball League, which has been separated for five years, is now reviving its old appearance, and there will inevitably be a grand occasion at that time.

Philippine National Secondary School Federation Games

The 1940 Philippine National Secondary School Federation Games are scheduled to open at Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija province at 3:00 PM on Saturday (the 10th) of this week. A total of sixty district education supervisors from all over the Philippines will be concentrated in the city at that time. In addition to serving as track and field officials, they will take the opportunity to hold a meeting to discuss issues related to student sports and military training in schools under the Department of Education. The plan for next year's Federation Games will also be discussed together. All athlete groups from Manila, Baguio, Visayas, and Mindanao are scheduled to take a special train at the Tutuban Station in Manila at 3:00 PM on Thursday afternoon. The other athlete groups from the northern region will meet at the Mejia Station and transfer to the special train departing from Manila. All athletes will arrive in Cabanatuan City on the 8th. All athletes will stay in the large school buildings of the provincial high school in the city. The conference sports field is conveniently located adjacent to the school, which is very convenient for athletes to practice. As for the district supervisors, they will stay in the buildings near the conference sports field. Officials of the Nueva Ecija provincial government have specially scheduled a grand welcome party to be held at the Cabanatuan public square on Friday afternoon to welcome the officials and athletes of all visiting teams, as the conference is scheduled to officially open on Saturday afternoon. In addition to track and field and ball sports, this year's Federation Games will also feature recreational dance performances. The opening day (the 10th) is designated as Philippine President Quezon Day, February 12th as Philippine Secretary of Education Bocobo Day, February 14th as Philippine Vice President Osme√±a Day, and February 17th as Philippine Congressman Day. On each day, public schools in Nueva Ecija province will perform a thousand-person drill, human pyramids, Philippine folk dances, and other recreational programs, with the intention of expressing respect for the leaders of the Philippine government.

New Records in Women's Track and Field

The athlete group of the Southern Luzon District Sports Association is scheduled to depart from Naga City in Camarines Sur province this morning to go to Cabanatuan City in Nueva Ecija province to participate in the Philippine Inter-Secondary School Federation Games to be held on Saturday of this week. After the men's and women's athletes in the district were selected, they immediately began active practice. Recently, a review of the results was held in Naga City, and three women's track and field records were broken. Ms. Isidrito, a female sprinter who broke the Philippine record in the 100-meter dash with 12.6 seconds at the Southern Luzon District Games in Tsushima, set a new record of 12.5 seconds during the review. Ms. Akira, a fifth-grade student at Menara North Elementary School, previously achieved a javelin throw of 102 feet and 3 inches and a discus throw of 92 feet and 6 inches at the Southern Luzon District Games in Tsushima, which were already amazing results. Unexpectedly, during the review, her javelin throw reached 109 feet and 2 inches, and her discus throw reached 98 feet and 1 inch. Both results broke the conference record.

Women's Badminton is Popular

The 1940 Manila Women's Amateur Sports Association's Manila Open Women's Badminton League, which is sponsored by the Manila Women's Amateur Sports Association, has been competing since the start of the competition, with six teams vying for the title. The Philippine Women's Youth Association, which boasts highly skilled Siamese female players, defeated Potna High School 3-0, securing the championship this year. The European and American Youth Association, the champion of the previous year, also eliminated the American Overseas Chinese Public School 3-0, but because it had lost to the Philippine Women's Youth Association, it was relegated to second place. The 1940 Philippine Women's Badminton Championship, organized by the Philippine Sports Association, is scheduled to be held at the Rizal Memorial Sports Field from March 12th to 18th. There are four participating teams, namely the Manila Polo Club, McKinley, the Manila Women's Lacrosse Club, and the University of the Philippines. (Sent from Manila on the 13th)

### Western League Soccer Matches Canceled Yesterday Due to Rain, Group A May Be Difficult to Finish

Yesterday, there were a total of six Western League soccer matches, but all were canceled due to the continuous rain overnight and even heavier rain yesterday morning. The Yiyuan, Jiaozhou Park, and Racecourse were all flooded. Since the start of the year, Western League soccer has been interrupted by rain four times, which has greatly affected its scheduled schedule. The three soccer fields at Yiyuan, Jiaozhou Park, and the Racecourse will be closed in mid-April. As of now, of the five Western League cup competitions, only the North China Daily News Cup (champion: Italian Navy), the Reserve Cup (champion: Lax), and the Junior Cup (champion: Youyou Club) have ended. The International Cup and the Scott Cup each have one remaining final match. In the league, Group A has the most remaining matches, with 38 remaining. The Reserve Group has two remaining matches, and Groups B and C each have seven remaining matches, for a total of 56 remaining matches. Within these short five or six weeks, except for the cup competitions and the reserve, and the B and C groups, which can be successfully concluded, it may be difficult for Group A to complete all the matches. Perhaps, like last year, the standings of Group A will be determined based on the results of the first round, and it will remain unfinished.

### Marathon Practice Held Yesterday in the Rain, Results Unaffected

The athletes preparing to participate in this year's Chinese-Western Open 21-mile marathon race on March 31st still conducted their first regular practice race as scheduled at 7:30 AM yesterday under heavy rain. However, the roads were muddy and slippery, causing each racer to fall and become covered in mud. However, the results were not affected and remained excellent. Their fighting spirit is commendable. According to Mr. Liang Yaoting, the organizer of the association, the association's scheduled cross-country races will not be postponed, so participants must get used to slippery roads to prevent their strength from declining in the event of an official championship race held in the rain. Therefore, all practice races will be held as scheduled, even in rain or snow, to cultivate a habit of enduring hardship.

Old Newspaper Excerpts - Sixty-Seven Years Ago (33) (From the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)

### A Dream

There was a man named Wang Fengchen who was once on a boat in Xiangtan. Near where they were docked, a tall building had its bamboo curtain raised, revealing a young girl with her hair in a bun, holding a porcelain plate. She had finished her morning makeup and was pouring the remaining cosmetics and powder into the river. Their eyes met, and the plate fell to the ground. Wang was captivated by her beauty. After the incident, the boat quickly set sail, and he was unable to inquire about her. When he passed by again, the beautiful girl was gone, and things were completely different. Wang was filled with regret. Later, he learned that there was a Zhou Great King Temple in northern Hubei that was known for its miraculous power. Wang prepared offerings and went to worship, staying overnight at the temple to pray for a dream. After going to bed, he dreamed that he was in a place with bean trellises and flower racks, next to a small stream. There was a bridge over the stream, and to the east of the bridge, a double door was slightly ajar. There was a small pond in the courtyard, full of blooming white lotus flowers, filling the air with fragrance. He followed the path to the corridor, hall, and room. There was a green parrot on a stand outside the window, and it cried out in alarm when it saw him. Wang hesitated, wanting to avoid it, but he had already been noticed inside the room, and someone cried out "Thief!" which startled him awake. It was just a dream. Months later, Wang abandoned his studies and became a merchant, traveling to Chengdu. He wandered aimlessly, and the stream, bridge, and door appeared before him. Peeking through the gap in the door, he saw the white lotus flowers blooming in the pond, and the dream vividly came back to him. Just as he was wondering, he met two old men and inquired about the owner of the garden, who turned out to be from the Chen family. He eagerly asked about the young woman, and the old men said, "Mr. Chen does have a daughter, but she doesn't speak or smile and has been bedridden for months." The next day, Wang used his medical knowledge to make a name for himself, and Mr. Chen was pleased and invited him to diagnose her. The girl's condition was deteriorating, but her beauty had increased. She stared at Wang, and he recognized her as the girl on the building by the river that day. Wang did not know much about medicine, but he prescribed a formula, and she recovered after one dose. Later, Wang expressed his intention to propose marriage, but Mr. Chen refused, and the girl fell ill again. Mr. Chen begged him to diagnose her again and especially pleaded with him. On the night of their engagement, he told her about his dream, and they both sighed that heaven and earth are one dream, and theÁºò‰ªΩ between past and present is also a dream, just like the Li poem that says, "Living in this world is like a great dream."

### Chairman Chiang's Black Cloak

‚Äî Jiang

When the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee was held at the National Government Auditorium on Shangqing Temple in Chongqing, Chairman Chiang, wearing a yellow wool uniform and draped in a black cloak, naturally attracted the most respect and attention from the entire audience.

Chairman Chiang always wears this black cloak when he goes out. People who pay attention to current affairs must be very familiar with this black cloak.

This black cloak was a gift from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Chairman Chiang. In the middle layer of the cloak's material, there is a very ingenious structure that can withstand bullet attacks, but the weight is only equivalent to an ordinary wool overcoat. This special bulletproof structure is said to have been invented by Mussolini himself!

### An American Celebrated Woman Sends Meals

‚Äî ÂΩ≥‰∫ç

The U.S. government offices do not provide meals as a rule; officials must go home to eat. However, when work is extremely hectic, officials do not have time to go home and must eat hastily outside. Wives who deeply love their official husbands often personally deliver meals to the office for their husbands to eat. Mrs. Hull, wife of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mrs. W. B. Bankhead are also part of this daily meal-delivery group. These two ladies noticed that their husbands would forget to eat when overwhelmed with public affairs, working on an empty stomach or gulping down food hastily, which is not conducive to health. Therefore, they specially prepared delicacies, kept warm in large thermos bottles, and delivered them to their husbands' offices. As for President Roosevelt's lunch, it was also delivered by his wife. She placed the lunch on a state-of-the-art electric table, which could keep the food warm until any time of day. The table was equipped with casters, allowing the food to be moved to any location.

### One Week Economic Menu

‚Äî Ms. Hua Ying

Now that I have introduced the small yellow croaker, a relatively inexpensive meat dish, I will introduce cabbage, an equally inexpensive vegetable. For example, a medium-sized soup bowl of cabbage only costs five cents. If you buy three heads, it should be enough to cook two bowls for lunch and dinner. Cabbage is a favorite vegetable of my family, so it is often seen on our table every few days. Speaking of cooking methods, it is suitable for both meat and vegetarian dishes. For meat dishes, it can be stir-fried with pork or beef slices, or made into soup with beef, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes, or shredded and stir-fried with shredded pork, or the large leaves can be used to wrap meat patties and make dumplings, all of which are delicious. For vegetarian dishes, in addition to the most common braised method, my family also likes to eat it with vinegar dressing. The cooking method is very simple: after braising (use less soy sauce), add a little sugar and vinegar, and serve it with rice, which is very refreshing.

### (4) Vegetarian Yellow Croaker A

Ingredients: MSG, bamboo shoots, water chestnut flour, wheat flour, shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, Chinese cabbage, tomato sauce or chili sauce, soy sauce, etc.

Preparation: Finely chop the bamboo shoots and shiitake mushrooms separately. Mix water chestnut flour and wheat flour with water to make a batter, but not too thick. Add the chopped bamboo shoots, mushroom bits, and appropriate amount of MSG into the batter and mix well. Then, shape into fish patties and deep-fry in boiling oil. Separately cook the Chinese cabbage and potatoes and place them beside the "fish." Serve with tomato sauce or chili sauce for dipping, just like fried yellow croaker in Western cuisine.

### (5) Vegetarian Yellow Croaker B

Ingredients: Sweet potatoes, tofu skin, bamboo shoots, MSG, tomato sauce or chili sauce, etc.

Preparation: Cook the sweet potatoes until soft, peel and mash them into a paste. Finely shred the bamboo shoots and mix them into the sweet potato paste, adding an appropriate amount of MSG. Then, shape into fish and wrap with tofu skin. Cook in boiling oil. Place in a bowl and serve with tomato sauce or chili sauce for dipping. The taste is truly comparable to real yellow croaker.

### President Roosevelt's Housing

‚Äî Qinghui

U.S. President Roosevelt's annual salary is only $75,000. If he were to use this money to cover his clothing, food, housing, and transportation, it would not be a particularly luxurious lifestyle. However, the reality is quite different. His residence, the magnificent White House in Washington, is entirely maintained by the government. The cost of his cars, medicines, and servants' wages is also paid by the government.

The U.S. Congress allocates $140,000 annually in the budget for White House expenses, including repairs, decorations, heating, and electricity.

The White House has 21 bedrooms, a gym, a swimming pool, and a uniquely constructed glass greenhouse on the grounds, valued at $1.5 million. In addition, there is a private grooming area for the President, where he goes every morning. The groomer's salary, as well as the cost of soap and lotion, are all covered by the government.

The White House motor pool has 12 chauffeurs, whose wages total $17,500. Their uniforms cost $2,500. As for the cars, the annual expense is $35,000.

### Amusing Anecdotes of Empress Dowager Cixi Riding in Vehicles

‚Äî Yuming

During the winter vacation, I happened to obtain a copy of "Empress Dowager Cixi: A Photographic Record." This book is a record of Ms. Carl's photography of the Empress Dowager in 1903, and it contains many detailed descriptions of the Empress Dowager's anecdotes. I have excerpted the amusing anecdotes of the Empress Dowager riding in rickshaws, trains, and automobiles below for the amusement of readers.

"The Empress Dowager often took a rickshaw for outings. The vehicle was exquisitely crafted, with a golden dragon coiled around the handle, gazing upward. The two wheels were made of rubber, making it light and smooth, unprecedented. A palace eunuch pulled it in front, and another eunuch pushed it from behind. The Empress Dowager was delighted to sit in it. However, the Empress Dowager said that it was not as comfortable as a sedan chair."

"The palace also has two new types of transportation. One is a short-distance light railway line, starting at the entrance of the palace gate and ending outside the Empress Dowager's bedroom. All the machinery is complete, but slightly smaller than usual. The person who built this line was a new-party official of China, who intended to let the Empress Dowager know the convenience of the railway, so as to induce the Empress Dowager to plan the construction of Chinese railways. However, the Empress Dowager did not like to travel by this, because the engine was too vibrating and the car seat was too cramped."

"The other is the automobile. There are more than a dozen vehicles in the palace, all presented by Chinese officials returning from abroad to please the sovereign. One of them, in yellow, painted with double dragons, has a throne in the glass room. It is an automobile for the exclusive use of the Empress Dowager. However, the Empress Dowager has never tried to sit in it, because there is a difficult problem to solve! The story is: Palace eunuchs are not allowed to sit in front of the Empress Dowager, but driving an automobile requires sitting. If the Empress Dowager rides in the automobile, there must be a driver sitting next to her, which would greatly contradict the old rules and lose the dignity of the sovereign. Therefore, the people in the palace discussed it for a long time, but could not come to a decision. However, the Empress Dowager wanted to try it for fun, even if it broke the old rules. But in the end, others dissuaded her, because in addition to conflicting with the old rules, they were also afraid of unexpected dangers, so the Empress Dowager never tried it."

### Hitler's Hobbies

‚Äî Chen Nianyun

The German dictator Hitler does not smoke, drink alcohol, drink tea, or drink coffee; however, he likes to have a glass of mineral water, or lemonade, or milk with a little brandy after finishing work.

Some say that Hitler is a vegetarian because he likes to eat creamed spinach, gravy, potatoes, and pasta; and eggs are something he "cannot live without in a meal."

He likes to listen to music, watch movies, appreciate paintings, and play with children; he also likes to boat on the Baltic Sea and play with dogs of various styles.

He does not like "fast," he hates "fast" the most; it is said that the speed of the train he rides on must never exceed forty miles per hour.

### Cigarettes and Celebrities

‚Äî Jingzheng

The writers Emerson and Carlyle, one English and one American, had few readers. One evening in 1833, Emerson visited Carlyle in England. When they met, they said nothing to each other, but just bit their pipes and smoked wildly, and when they finished smoking, they shook hands and parted. From beginning to end, they did not say a word.

One day, the poet Tennyson accepted an invitation from the British Prime Minister Lord Rosebery. Rosebery said, "I recently heard that you are going to travel to Venice. There must be many works of art in that ancient city that you can admire and be interested in, right?" Tennyson replied: "I hate Venice. Because there is no tobacco there to smoke, it will cause me unhappiness."

U.S. President Grant always had a cigarette in his mouth, no matter where he was. German Prime Minister Bismarck once said, "The importance of tobacco is when there is only one cigarette left by your side."

Napoleon did not have the habit of smoking. Once, the Turkish envoy presented him with a pipe and cigarettes. He took a puff and sent the cigarette to the bottom of his throat, and shouted "Devil" non-stop.

When Edison was studying science with his mind, he usually smoked three dozen of the strongest Luzon cigars a day, and usually smoked about a dozen a day.

### Stalin's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

‚Äî Gong Huai

The Soviet leader Stalin is a shrewd, witty, and strong-willed person. When he was young, he lived in a poor family, so he developed the habit of enduring hardship from a young age. Now, although his status is very different from when he was young, his enjoyment is not much different from when he was young, and he has no luxurious habits. This is a rare thing for ordinary people, and it is also the greatness of Stalin.

Stalin usually does not pay attention to his clothing. He only wears his uniform when there are major national events, and he usually does not wear it easily. He just wears a dark green vest with the zipper fastened, riding breeches, and a pair of high-top leather boots. When he goes out, he also wears a small hat. For Stalin, it is just wearing clothes casually. Later, the people of the Soviet Union, in order to express their respect for Stalin and their loyalty to Stalin, also imitated this kind of clothing, especially the senior officials in the party. It seems that wearing "Stalin's clothes" is enough to show that he is Stalin's loyal comrade.

Stalin's food, he is not willing to just take it and eat it. He knows that there must be many people secretly plotting against him. In the past, it was said that Stalin's food had to be tasted by his wife first. Now that his wife is dead, it must be carefully inspected before he is willing to eat it. He loves to smoke Edgeworth tobacco the most, but he is not willing to smoke this kind of foreign-made tobacco in public. During meals, he often puts a lit pipe by his side, and takes a puff or two when the food is served. His favorite drink is brandy, and he drinks a lot.

Stalin's residence in Moscow is in the Kremlin, which is not a residence, but a palace garden, with fortresses, churches, barracks, and other buildings, about forty or fifty, and a garden. Stalin only lives in three rooms, but he does not work in it. Stalin lives in the countryside villa Da cha a lot. The place is one hour away from Moscow, in a place called Usova-Arkanaelskaya near the Mokva River. The villa occupies ten acres and was formerly the residence of a wealthy gold miner, surrounded by very thick walls.

Stalin's travel is very heavily guarded. On the road he travels on, there are dense posts on both sides. Three "Paka" cars drive together at a high speed. Stalin often sits side by side with the driver. The order of the car he sits in is changed every day. When pedestrians pass through the road that Stalin enters and exits, they are often politely stopped by the guards. However, there have also been many times when he walked on the street with friends, walking back to the Kremlin from the opera house.

The World

### What Are Ninety Percent of People Doing?

‚Äî Tidi Ni

According to accurate estimates, the recent population residing in Shanghai totals approximately three million, while those with jobs are less than 300,000 (including managers of businesses down to small laborers and rickshaw pullers). So what are the remaining 2.7 million people‚Äîaccounting for 90 percent of the total‚Äîdoing? Or how do they sustain their lives? This has already become a serious problem. Because there are few producers and many consumers, after some time, Shanghai's abnormal prosperity may come to an end.

Among these 90 percent of "unemployed people," due to the difference between rich and poor, they can be divided into the following categories, and their views on life are also different from each other:

(1) Those who have no worries about food and clothing: These people have money. They originally intended to come to Shanghai as rentiers. They spend their days in lavish entertainment, with dance halls and theaters being the most frequented places. The rest of their time is spent on speculation and gambling, since they have money to do whatever they want.

(2) Those who are law-abiding: Most of them are from well-to-do families. They came to Shanghai originally to observe the situation for a year and a half, and then return to their hometown to live, but unexpectedly the war has dragged on for two or three years. They cannot leave temporarily, so they have to implement austerity measures, and some have opened small shops to earn some income. These people are the most law-abiding.

(3) The extremely poor: They do not have a penny on them. It is best if refugee shelters can accommodate them. If they are full, they have no choice but to become beggars. Fortunately, if they meet an acquaintance, they can be introduced to a place to eat a little bit of hard food. If they borrow some usurious loans, they will do some hawking. The fact that wool yarn has risen from two yuan to more than ten yuan per pound has nothing to do with them. The increase in sesame cakes and fried dough sticks from two cents to three cents each is really going to kill them.

And among the 90 percent, the largest number are those who neither have millions of dollars nor can do manual labor. However, their desires are equal to the first category, thus creating a terrifying Shanghai.

### Please Kindly "Maintain Order"

‚Äî Chu

Since rice and flour have been sold at fair prices, the general poor and common people have been able to catch their breath and live under heavy oppression. This is something that is worth our gratitude and more. As for increasing the quantity and long-term management, etc., within the possible range, I think it can also "do good to the end." What I want to talk about now is the issue of order.

In front of each small shop selling at a fair price, the lines of people often extend to dozens of storefronts, or even turn the corner and line up on another side street. The people at the back, not to mention not knowing when it will be their turn to get close to the store, cannot even see the shadow of the store. Everyone knows that the time of these hardworking people is more valuable than anyone else's. If they have to wait all day to buy rice or flour, they will lose a day's work time; losing a day's work time also means losing a day's income, so their eagerness and desire to rush ahead is not necessarily a deliberate disruption of order. Like when fair sales were first started, the tragedy of people being crushed was unfortunately happened. Recently, due to the close attention of the authorities and the kind guidance, and the buyers also know that rushing ahead will only prolong the time, so the order has indeed been very good. However, there are also occasional events, such as some people who cannot leave their children at home in order to buy rice, so they take them to "queue up" together, but children do not understand what order is, so in order to take care of the children, mothers or fathers often have to temporarily withdraw from the line, but when they want to make up the original position, the people behind them have already filled the gap. At this time, there is inevitably a little bit of dispute. If the caring police officers do not try their best to persuade, or think of other remedies, when the two sides argue too aggressively, they can also make the maintainers of order themselves fail to maintain order first. This kind of occasional situation is not much, but it cannot be said that there is absolutely none, so I appeal to the police officers who maintain order to pity them a little, and spend more time trying to eliminate the disaster caused by those who are not deliberately disobeying order, and at the same time, this is also fulfilling the responsibility of so-called "maintaining order."

### Thoughts on "A Tram Passenger Fell to Their Death"

‚Äî Li Xingru

Reading the news of the local newspaper on February 29, which reported "Tram passengers jumped off the tram and fell to their death, etc.", I couldn't help but think of the situation I see every day.

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the population has surged, and the crowding of passengers on trams and buses has broken all previous records. Every day at 9:00 am and 5:00 pm, when students go to school and offices are working, at each tram and bus stop, passengers line up to wait for the bus. At first glance, it is like a short wall, scrambling and fighting, and women and children are at risk of being squeezed and falling at any time.

Last spring, my friend Mr. Huang was boarding a bus in front of the Great World. Because the bus was crowded at the time, Mr. Huang's foot had not yet stepped on the bus, and the conductor had already rang the bell to start the bus. At the same time, the iron door was not closed. Mr. Huang held the iron bar of the car door, and just as he was about to get on the bus, the bus suddenly started to drive forward. Mr. Huang's hand holding the iron bar could not be released, and he was dragged to the ground and lay next to the rear wheel. His clothes were torn and his arm was injured. At that time, the conductor knew that he had rung the bell to start the bus without closing the door, and he could not avoid the crime of negligence. He asked Mr. Huang for forgiveness, and said that the end of the year was approaching, and his family was depending on him for their livelihood. Mr. Huang was a zealous Christian, with a compassionate heart, so he recognized his bad luck and rebuked him slightly.

In summary, on the one hand, it is the passengers who are rushing ahead and lacking the morality of yielding, on the other hand, the conductor should not ring the bell to start the bus before the iron door is closed properly, and treats the lives of passengers like child's play. This matter and the situation of the passenger who fell to their death reported on the 29th are similar to each other. In the final analysis, the tram authorities have failed to give the conductors considerable training.

Because of the occurrence of this tragedy, I would like to say a word to the tram authorities. All outdoor staff on the bus should be constantly guided and trained to increase the knowledge and morality of the employees, so that the tragedy can be avoided from recurring.

### Practical Religion (2)

Another time, Jesus preached to the crowd, and at the end he said, "Everyone who hears my words and does them is like a person who builds a house on a rock. The wind and rain will not cause it to collapse." He always put the focus of religion on the word "do." He also said, "Everyone who does God's will can understand the truth." That is, for those who seek knowledge, he also points out this path of practice. There is no doubt that religion is a practical method for life. Many people think that religion is something outside of life, such as vaccination to prevent danger. Some people regard religion as a piece of clothing that can be worn to increase their appearance, such as a certain gentleman who often loudly says on the Lord's Day that he wants to be close to God and study the Lord's way, but on the other days, 75 percent of his income comes from exploiting the poor. He regards pretentious appearance as religion, which is hypocritical and useless, because he himself has never done service and sacrifice. The first great law of life, "love your neighbor as yourself," he has forgotten. True religion is an essential part of personality, an essential quality of character. Jesus taught people that the kingdom of God is like the various behaviors we see every day‚Äîa man planting in a garden, a woman looking for lost money, a farmer pulling up weeds, a fisherman mending nets. Someone found a manuscript in Egypt that said, "Jesus said, wherever there is someone lifting stones or splitting wood, I am there." In regular work, you find God, you understand the essence of true religion, because religion is doing beneficial and constructive things. Personally, if religion is to benefit us, or generally speaking, if religion is to do fermenting work in society, there must be a true religious revival. Religion must be able to be applied to people's lives. (To be continued) (If you want to study, please send a letter to P.O. Box 1227)

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter 21: Combining Economic Management with Fiber Quality, Using Machinery to Assist in Writing.

It turned out that Jiang Jingrong had another important task when he returned to Shanghai this time. Because Shanghai will soon be opening a national silk conference, he is representing the silk weaving factory association to attend this national silk conference. This national silk conference was convened by the National Economic Committee of the Republic of China. Since the war ended, the silk industry has been revived, and its output ranks first in the world. Foreign trade can also be regarded as second to none, especially in sales to the Americas, followed by Europe. In the past, raw silk was sold to the United States, but now it has been overwhelmed by Chinese raw silk, because Chinese silk is cheap and the products are good. Therefore, in the past few years, China has added many large silk factories. And provinces that have not paid much attention to silkworm raising in the past, such as Sichuan, Guangdong, Hunan, and Yunnan, are also raising silkworms on a large scale. In addition, many silkworm industry schools and seed breeding grounds have also been established in various places, so naturally the varieties have been further improved. Foreign countries cannot compete with our country in this matter. Because silkworm raising is mostly manual, and the manual labor in our country is cheap and diligent. The soil and climate have natural advantages. Foreign countries can only produce artificial silk, and with the help of chemical machinery, mass production seems to be much more convenient than silkworm raising. However, people who have tried it down, artificial silk is still far inferior to silk. At this moment, although the output of our silk is several times more than before the war, it is still in greater demand than supply. Why is that? Because so much is exported to foreign countries, and the domestic silk weaving factories and other weaving factories are also like bamboo shoots after the rain, competing to grow and thrive. It seems that some of the silk produced every year are not enough, and the value will increase. Now the amount of silk produced in China every year has been controlled by the state. For this reason, the National Economic Committee held a silk conference this winter regarding the silk part, and decided on the policy of raising silkworms and producing silk next spring. The people convened at this meeting include international trade experts, silkworm breeding experts, textile industry experts, silk factory associations, silk weaving factory associations, farmer associations from silkworm raising areas in various places, as well as silkworm industry cooperatives, silk industry banks, women silkworm raisers' associations, etc., all sent representatives to attend. Jiang Jingrong is one of the representatives of the silk weaving factory association. Although he also advocates that Chinese goods should be exported to foreign countries to exchange for foreign machinery to manufacture Chinese goods, he not only advocates the export of Chinese raw silk, but also advocates weaving Chinese raw silk into silk, and then exporting it after it has become a finished product. He feels that the benefits are better, and China's excellent craftsmanship can also be famous all over the world. (245)

### Public Toilet Price Increase: Inconvenience for Defecation

‚Äî Gao Gao

The public toilets established by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement were originally intended to provide convenience to pedestrians, allowing everyone to enter and defecate without paying a fee. If you happened to forget to bring toilet paper, you could buy two sheets for one cent at the entrance. This was quite convenient for ordinary people, and it also kept the streets clean and sanitary, truly opening a door of convenience.

However, the reality is never so simple. Contractors have their own tricks, and toilet attendants have their own abilities. Although it is stipulated that toilet paper should not be forcibly sold, they forcibly sell it anyway. Although it is stipulated that two sheets cost one cent, they change it to one sheet for one cent. This was the situation in the past. Now, toilet paper is being charged double. If you don't offer two cents in legal tender, don't even think about going inside to relieve yourself. And the implementation of this illegal method is not limited to a few or isolated toilets; almost all the public toilets in the International Settlement are like this.

### Selling Coal Balls at a Fixed Price

‚Äî Peng

Finally, coal balls are being sold at a fixed price of six dollars per dan (a traditional Chinese unit of weight). However, according to my wife's report, they are not easy to ignite and the firepower is weak. Upon inspecting the ashes in the coal stove, they are all black clumps of sand and mud. Upon inquiring with the housewives living nearby, they all said that the coal balls they recently bought have too much mud in them.

Although we do not know the method of manufacturing coal balls, there is probably a standard ratio for the proportion of coal dust and sand. Is the mud-heavy coal ball being sold now an accidental phenomenon, or is it that in order to sell at a fixed price, it is necessary to reduce costs? This is quite suspicious.
