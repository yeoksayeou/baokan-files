Editorial

### The Japanese Expansion of Blockade and the Shanghai Market

According to the statistics released by the Jianghai Customs, there was a trade surplus in the first six months of this year. At first glance, this seems to be evidence of a prosperous market. However, in reality, we cannot be so optimistic. The value of imports is calculated in Customs Gold Units based on the official exchange rate of the Central Bank, which is 2.707 legal tender yuan per Customs Gold Unit. Therefore, the resulting figure is smaller than the figure calculated using the black market exchange rate. On the other hand, the increase in the value of exports is indeed affected by the rising prices caused by the compression of the black market exchange rate, so it is relatively large. Thus, comparing two items calculated using incommensurate units results in a surplus of 250 million yuan. If the value of imports were also converted using the black market exchange rate, the magnitude of the trade deficit would be apparent from the table below.

Calculation Method	Legal Tender Value of Imports Calculated According to…	Surplus or Deficit After Comparison with Export Value

(1) Official Exchange Rate of Customs Gold Units as Quoted by the Central Bank: 2.707 yuan	385,553,599	Surplus of 251,898,971

(2) Black Market Exchange Rate of British Pounds Converted to Customs Gold Units: 9.75 yuan	1,388,676,605	Deficit of 751,224,035

(3) Black Market Exchange Rate of U.S. Dollars Converted to Customs Gold Units: 11 yuan	1,566,712,070	Deficit of 929,259,500

(Note) The value of imports is 142,428,370 Customs Gold Units, and the value of exports is 637,452,570 yuan. Comparisons are made after conversion.

If we use the black market exchange rate, calculating with British pounds, it turns into a deficit of 750 million yuan. If we use U.S. dollars, the deficit reaches as high as 930 million yuan. Is it truly justified to call this "an improvement in foreign trade"? With the war dragging on for years, the trade deficit is still so large. One can imagine that the people of Shanghai are still indulging in ease and pleasure, unable to change their extravagant habits, only seeking foreign goods.

Now, Japan is both forcing Britain and France to yield and strengthen the blockade on the passageways through Burma and Vietnam to the Southwest, and also using its naval forces to blockade sea transport from Hangzhou Bay to Quanzhou. From now on, China will have no other route besides transport through the Northwest to the Soviet Union. The inland regions will feel even more isolated from the outside world, and Shanghai's commerce and industry will lack opportunities for vitality. In reality, profit and loss are always intertwined and cannot be viewed in isolation. We must recognize that the result of a tight blockade is that the material lives of the Chinese people will inevitably become more difficult, and the trade of various countries with China will also suffer significant losses, with the United States being the most affected. This will stimulate the international community to react against the aggressor, and inform the international community to strengthen the advocacy of the Open Door Policy, which will inevitably form an important factor that will benefit the future overall situation. This is the first point. While cutting off incoming goods, they are also plugging the leaks. This is the second point. The difficulty of obtaining materials is a natural phenomenon for the time being. However, it is a certainty that this will stimulate inland production and promote the completion of the self-sufficiency policy. This is the third point. Recently, the goods that have infiltrated the inland regions from the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian have included very few Western goods and very few domestic goods, but a large number of domestic goods that have been disguised. In the future, Japanese warships will prohibit this on their own initiative. This is the fourth point. Customs revenue is falling into the hands of the Japanese and will only be used by them. From now on, it will be sharply reduced. This is the fifth point. With these five points, it is not necessary to view the blockade as an extremely vicious measure by the enemy. The method for dealing with the blockade is to endure the temporary suffering and do everything possible to create a lasting foundation and open up a vast new world.

Furthermore, focusing on Shanghai alone, during the blockade of the ports of Fujian and Zhejiang, foreign trade will inevitably show a significant decline compared to the first half of the year, regardless of whether it is a trade deficit or a trade surplus. The people of Shanghai indulge in ease and pleasure, and are extravagant, which is only a minor reason for creating a large total import and export trade volume. The main reason is that Shanghai has not lost its status as a major port for import and export, and the Shanghai market benefits from this import and export. After the blockade of Fujian and Zhejiang, Shanghai will at least lose the commercial benefits of the two provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. Moreover, the ports of Fujian and Zhejiang are not only the gateways to the two provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, and even Sichuan are all connected through Fujian and Zhejiang, and the number of passengers and goods traveling back and forth is considerable. This is evidenced by the fact that before the blockade, ships sailed back and forth between Shanghai and Fujian and Zhejiang. Therefore, the total throughput that Shanghai will reduce in the future far exceeds what is produced and sold in the provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. Given this, what will be the impact on the Shanghai market?

Forced by circumstances, the Shanghai market will inevitably decline gradually, and the losses will be shared by both China and foreign countries. From the perspective of the overall situation, this has no great significance. The proportion of Shanghai in the overall situation has gradually decreased over the past three years. After the Shanghai market declines, the proportion will decrease even further. Even if the decline is so extreme that it is considered almost equal to zero, it is still acceptable. However, for the people of Shanghai, they must not view themselves as redundant growths and sit idly by as the end comes. For the sake of today, there are three essential things: first, urgently transfer funds to the inland areas as much as possible to engage in production, in order to seek compensation and development; second, all industries, and even every household, should tighten up and save as much as possible in order to stabilize their livelihoods and extend the period of maintaining vitality; third, curb improper price gouging and rent increases, and make them as low as possible in order to seek a way of understanding and mutual assistance. I would especially like to respectfully advise the Shanghai business community that it must be aware that Shanghai in the future is definitely not what it used to be. In all business operations, you must change your mindset, change your perspective, and set new directions to adapt to the times. Otherwise, if a small business fails, or if the entire city is panicked, it will be unavoidable.

### Regarding the British Blockade of the Burma Road, the U.S. Government Deeply Disappointed; the U.S. Fleet Stationed in Hawaii Sufficient to Increase Chinese Courage; American Residents in the Philippines Telegraph Request for Strong Policy Adoption

Washington - Secretary of State Hull yesterday declined to comment to reporters on Prime Minister Churchill's Wednesday confirmation to the public of the Burma Road blockade. However, most correspondents in Washington felt a deep impression that the majority of the U.S. government was deeply disappointed by Britain's action. Hull claimed that he would not criticize until he received the official text of Churchill's speech. Observers believe this is the only way to avoid direct conflict with the British Prime Minister, but Hull had previously expressed strong protests on this matter twice. Government officials were not deeply impressed by Britain's conflation of the Burma Road blockade with the promotion of peace between China and Japan, but they similarly refused to criticize it. Neutral observers believe that a fair peace is currently unlikely to arise, as China still has inexhaustible strength to continue resisting and will never easily accept Japan's conditions based on compensating for the losses of the past three years. Those close to the government do not pay excessive attention to the Anglo-Japanese agreement, as the road is fundamentally impassable during the three months of the blockade due to the rainy season. They say that during these three months, Britain will demonstrate its strength to resist the German offensive, and by then, Britain will be in a better position to renegotiate the Burma Road issue with Japan. These people also say that if Britain does not succumb to Germany after three months, it will triumph in Europe, at which time Japan will not threaten Britain again in East Asia. At the same time, they admit that the Burma Road blockade will psychologically affect some Chinese people, especially when Chinese leaders may be starting to feel discouraged. The continued firm attitude of the United States and the stationing of the U.S. fleet in Hawaii may increase Chinese courage and provide spiritual assistance. They also said that the recent widespread rumors of large-scale Soviet military supplies transportation to the Far East are psychologically sufficient to maintain Chinese hope from collapsing. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

Manila - Forty Americans residing in the Russian town of Dikiao yesterday telegraphed President Roosevelt, requesting the United States to adopt a strong policy on the Burma Road agreement. The telegram was the same as the one previously sent to Secretary of State Hull and the one sent to Shanghai's U.S. Fourth Naval Commander, Captain Baker, on July 16, saying, "We believe that succumbing to Japanese pressure is the surest way to seal our fate. We ask the United States to take a firm stand." (United Press dispatch, 19th)

Churchill Says He Does Not Want to Force Peace on China

London - Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain wished to see China remain whole. Labour MP Noel-Baker then asked: "Can the Prime Minister's words be taken to mean that the British government will never force peace upon the Chinese people or compel them to accept peace terms tantamount to surrender to aggression?" Churchill replied: "That expresses my views." Noel-Baker further asked: "Does the Prime Minister mean that the British government still adheres to its Far Eastern policy based on the Nine-Power Treaty, etc.?" Churchill replied: "I have already made a statement that has been carefully considered. My previous views on this matter are well known, and I do not wish to add to them at this time." Former War Minister Hore-Belisha asked: "Does the Prime Minister believe that this concession to Japan will genuinely gain Japan's goodwill? Did the Prime Minister consult with the U.S. and Soviet governments throughout, and did he act with their consent?" Churchill replied: "I cannot give such assurance. I know nothing. I think that what we encounter in the Far East will be greatly influenced by what we encounter here. Of course, what we have done has not been done without fully considering the attitudes of the U.S. and the Soviet Union." Conservative MP Milner asked if the Prime Minister could give them an opportunity to have a full debate on the Far Eastern situation soon. The Prime Minister replied that a debate on foreign affairs could be held in the next week or two. Conservative MP Jewel asked the Under-Secretary of State whether, during negotiations with Japan, they would avoid the impression that Britain was willing to put pressure on the Chinese government or encourage a "Nanjing government." Butler replied in writing that the British government had no intention of pressuring the Chinese government and did not recognize the Nanjing regime.

At the same time, Foreign Secretary Halifax read the same statement on the Burma Road agreement in the House of Lords. Labour peer Addison called the agreement a most unfortunate measure, hoping that it would not have the detrimental effects he feared in China and elsewhere. Former Home Secretary Samuel said that if the hope for peace between China and Japan was not realized within a few months, then this measure might have to be extended indefinitely. Marley asked whether the government had consulted with the ambassadors to the U.S. and the Soviet Union regarding the impact of this decision on Anglo-Soviet and Anglo-American relations. The Foreign Secretary replied that the government had notified its ambassadors of the matter. He was not at liberty to state the extent of the exchange of views, but he believed that the government had not overlooked these considerations. The government had not been unmindful of the obligations it had accepted and the Nine-Power Treaty it had signed. The debate on this matter could be held secretly later. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

British Political Circles Attribute Concessions to Japan to the Soviet Union and the United States

London - Political figures here have recently commented on the British blockade of the Burma Road. It is said that the reason Britain reached an agreement with Japan was because it failed to obtain assistance from the United States and the Soviet Union. The British government has notified the U.S. government of the details of this negotiation. In essence, if Britain were to encounter serious difficulties with Japan due to adopting a strong policy, the United States might not be able to provide full assistance. As for the Soviet Union, the British government did not fully inform the country of the negotiation details. Although the meeting between the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Cripps, and Stalin was extremely harmonious, the degree of rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union was not sufficient to support Britain. Under these circumstances, Britain naturally could not adopt a policy in the Far East that would only increase its burden. Moreover, at this time, Britain is dealing with the European war with all its resources and strength, and it really has no time to spare for other matters. Unless the two major neutral countries, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, can adopt a firm attitude in the Far East, Britain will not be able to do anything. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Soviet Union Denies Britain Ever Sought Its Opinion

Moscow - British Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday when reporting on the Anglo-Japanese agreement to block the Burma Road that "Regarding the agreement, the British side had discussed it with the Soviet Union." TASS has recently issued an officially authorized statement that what the British Prime Minister said is not true. In fact, the British government did not seek the Soviet Union's opinion or advice on this matter. In other words, the British side did not discuss the issue with the Soviet Union, and given the current state of Anglo-Soviet relations, the British government has no need to discuss this matter with the Soviet Union. In reality, British Under-Secretary of State Butler only notified the Soviet Ambassador Maisky, stating that the British government had decided to conclude an agreement with the Japanese side on the issue of blocking the Burma Road. (TASS dispatch, 19th)

China's Determination to Resist Will Not Be Weakened by This

Chongqing - After the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma transportation routes were successively interrupted, the relevant departments of the Chinese government are now preparing effective steps to continue to obtain supplies. At the same time, Northwest highway transportation is becoming more convenient than before. Therefore, the amount of supplies in this area will definitely increase. Upon examination, there is still a balance in the credit loan granted to China by the Soviet Union, and a large amount of goods can still be purchased. As for the British blockade of the Burma Road to make concessions to Japan, people from all walks of life here have generally said that China's determination to resist to the end will not only not be weakened by this, but will also be strengthened. A certain important person told a Havas reporter that Britain's betrayal of its promise to China will ultimately benefit China, as we have a full understanding of the need to be completely self-sufficient, and have worked hard to develop our own various resources. Before the development work yields results, the various main items currently stored are sufficient for use. Another important person also told a Havas reporter: "Anyone who believes that President Chiang may accept the attractive peace terms that Japan might offer on paper does not know President Chiang's character. He knows well that Japan will not be able to implement these conditions, and China's resources have not been exhausted and can still fight for several years. Therefore, he is determined to continue the war of resistance and is unwilling to risk China's fate as a gamble on Japan's unreliable promises. Japan is now eager to temporarily end the war so that it can seize opportunities elsewhere. Once it has gained something in the Pacific, its power will increase even further, and it will once again shift its focus to China. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, foreign opinion has often underestimated China's determination to resist and its ability to support itself, leading to numerous mistakes. If it is still believed at this time that China is willing to accept Japan's empty promises, it is another great mistake." (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Chongqing - The British government, disregarding Sino-British friendship and accepting Japan's illegal demands, signed the Anglo-Japanese agreement and suspended transportation on the Burma Road for three months. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life here were indignant and expressed their opinions.

### Japan Says It Does Not Want Other Countries to Mediate the Sino-Japanese War

Hong Kong - Tokyo report, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the press today, the spokesperson claimed that Japan does not intend to or welcome third countries coming forward to mediate or interfere in the Sino-Japanese incident. When a reporter asked how Japan reacted to Churchill's speech, the spokesperson said, Churchill's speech clarified Britain's intentions towards China and Japan, and this point was quite interesting. However, foreign countries have never suggested peace talks to Japan. What the Singapore Acting Governor Jones said in his broadcast speech was not true. If other countries make such a suggestion, the Japanese side must consider the content of the conditions listed therein and make a decision based on the current environment. When a reporter asked about Japan's peace negotiation conditions, the spokesperson said that it was inconvenient to discuss. When a reporter asked about how the Japanese side viewed Roosevelt's election as a presidential candidate, the spokesperson said that Japan did not feel interested in who the next presidential candidate of the United States was. Japan's attention is focused on the United States' foreign policy, especially its Far Eastern policy. He hoped that the United States' policy could adopt rational principles. When a reporter asked whether the opportunity for a Japanese-American compromise had already passed, the spokesperson said that Japan had completely and openly expressed its attitude and hoped to improve its relationship with the United States. In the past six months, Japan has been waiting for a straightforward reply from the United States, but it is still not too late to date. (Telegraph from 19th)

Tokyo - Japan hopes that the United States will be willing to be open and honest so that each can express their views and gain understanding. A spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that if the United States is willing to provide a clear answer, then what is lost in the east can still be gained in the west. He also said that Japan currently does not intend to ask a third country to intervene in the Sino-Japanese war. (Haitong Telegraph from 19th)

Residents collect fragments and sell them, which can be quite profitable. There was a thatched cottage that was destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The repair cost was only about 20 yuan, but the owner collected 100 jin of iron pieces and sold them for 170 yuan, leaving 150 yuan after the repairs. According to the general situation, repairs begin immediately after the bombing here, restoring the old appearance very quickly. If Japan wants to make Chongqing so devastated that it is uninhabitable, the intensity of the bombing must be increased at least four times compared to the past. In addition, the weather has cooled down in recent days, and the heat has dissipated, much to the residents' delight. In addition, the cloud cover has lowered, so even though it is the middle of the month, the moonlight is bright, and Japanese aircraft have not continued to fly to bomb. In short, President Chiang once said that the Chinese people are determined to resist to the end. By asking people from all walks of life here, one will know that this statement is not false.

### Konoe's Cabinet Formation Work Can Be Completed Very Soon; Yesterday Discussed Basic Foreign and Defense Policies with the Newly Appointed Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministers

Tokyo - According to semi-official Japanese news, four important members of the Konoe Cabinet met today and only dispersed after about five hours. Opinions have been completely compromised on basic foreign and defense policies. The attendees were the newly appointed Prime Minister Konoe, Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Yoshida, and Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke. Konoe's efforts to form a cabinet are now expected to make rapid progress. (Reuters Telegraph, 19th)

Tokyo - Political observers recently predicted that Prime Minister Konoe may complete his cabinet selection tomorrow, because Konoe met with his selected three cabinet members this afternoon, namely Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Yoshida, and Foreign Minister Matsuoka, to discuss policies. It is heard that they discussed issues such as foreign and domestic policies after the establishment of a one-party system and the consolidation of the national political front. Well-informed sources believe that the Konoe Cabinet will prepare to determine its foreign policy based on the latest changes in the world situation. After this, Japan's foreign policy will especially focus on Germany, Italy, Britain, and the Soviet Union. In addition, it will implement a national mobilization order and consolidate national defense. As for the new cabinet's policy toward the "Nanjing Government," it will remain unchanged and will intensify military action against China in order to end the Chinese war as soon as possible. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

Tokyo - "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated today that Foreign Minister and Colonial Minister Matsuoka's view is that Japan in East Asia and Germany and Italy in Europe should move forward so that each can achieve their goals. Japan should first eliminate the power of Britain and France in East Asia, and then stabilize a broad new structure encompassing China, Japan, "Manchukuo," and Southeast Asia. Finally, it should negotiate an alliance with Germany and Italy, but unconditional rapprochement with totalitarian states will not be effective at present. Furthermore, the tendency of the United States to interfere in East Asian and West Pacific affairs is the "greatest threat to the Far East" and should be completely eliminated. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Chongqing - The semi-official newspaper, the English-language "Chu Pao," recently stated that Konoe's cabinet formation is a sign of Japan's political bankruptcy. The newspaper said that Konoe took office as Prime Minister on the eve of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, but as a result, he was unable to prevent the war, nor was he able to end the war early. "Since Konoe previously failed to extricate the Japanese people from the Chinese quagmire, we believe that this time Konoe will also tend towards the same disappointment." The newspaper continued, "The Japanese military's favor for Konoe is due to dissatisfaction with multi-party politics, because Konoe advocates a one-party system, which is supported by the Japanese military." The newspaper also said that Japan wants to end the Sino-Japanese War, but there are only two ways to go: first, automatically admit mistakes and withdraw Japanese troops; second, use extreme force to destroy China's resistance. Japan will never take the first point, and Japan's provinces also lack the wisdom and courage to adopt this strategy. It is feared that Japan also feels that the second point is impossible, because Japan has already adopted extreme force to attack China, and China's army is fighting more bravely, while the Japanese army is suffering a sad defeat. Japan, due to political bankruptcy, is thinking of using the opportunity of the European war to engage in a southern advance in order to acquire Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies.

### Soviet Union Strengthens Far East Defenses, Frequent Red Army Movements, Siberian Double-Track Railway Opens, Vladivostok Fleet Conducts Daily Drills

Tokyo: A traveler riding the Siberian Railway from Moscow to Vladivostok last week witnessed the Soviet Union dispatching a large number of fresh troops to the Far East to strengthen its new defense line along the "Manchukuo" border. The reporter saw more than twenty Red Army trains, each with sixty cars, fully loaded with tanks, artillery, transport vehicles, and ambulances, heading towards the naval area. Additionally, there were long train carriages, believed to be carrying military equipment, running day and night continuously. Many of the passengers in the reporter's carriage were Red Army naval and army officers, also heading to the naval area and defensive bases in Mongolia. It is believed that the Soviet military vehicles are reinforcing defenses in the Far East, and this large-scale military movement is noteworthy. Last week, "Manchukuo" protested to the Soviet Union regarding the reported conflicts on the "Manchukuo"-Outer Mongolia border. At the same time, the reporter, while in Moscow two weeks ago, saw that Moscow was determined to "improve" Soviet defenses in the East, the Baltic Sea, and the Balkans, as the world situation was "favorable" for this military deployment. In Vladivostok, the reporter saw thirty Soviet warships concentrated in the port, including a squadron of new light cruisers and several 1,500-ton light destroyers. During the reporter's six-day stay, multiple submarines conducted daily exercises, and the high ground around the port was heavily fortified, with groups of soldiers working on defensive works daily. The Soviet Union is also accelerating the completion of its large-scale railway plan to ensure sufficient supplies and movements in the Far East. The 8,000-mile Siberian Railway from Moscow to Vladivostok has now been built with double tracks open to traffic. During the ten-day journey, the reporter witnessed freight trains traveling back and forth day and night.

Germany-Soviet Relations Appear Close but Are Distant

The deep impression gained by the reporter during his fifteen days in the Soviet Union is that the Soviet Union believes that once the Rome-Berlin Axis defeats Britain, it will inevitably turn towards the Soviet Union. Therefore, until the war between Germany and Italy against Britain is decisively won, the Soviet Union seems determined to mobilize all its military and civilian resources to create its unprecedentedly great military power. According to reliable journalistic sources, the rapid collapse of France was a major blow to the people and senior officials of the Soviet government. German sources in the Swedish capital and Soviet sources in Moscow acknowledge the apparent closeness but actual distance between Germany and the Soviet Union, and there are even claims that a conflict of interest may occur in the near future. The reporter, while in the Soviet Union, confirmed that Stalin's policy is to seize important military bases in the Baltic Sea, the Balkans, and other areas to strengthen its defensive position.

Black Sea Agreement Under Negotiation

According to British diplomatic sources in Moscow, the new ambassador, Sir Stafford Cripps, received an "exceptionally warm" welcome from senior Soviet officials, including Foreign Minister Molotov. However, regarding rumors of secret British-Soviet military treaty negotiations, Moscow sources could not ascertain any details. It is widely believed that Britain has notified the Soviet Union that it will support any changes made by the Soviet Union in the Balkans, and that Turkey is no longer bound by its treaty with the Allied nations, allowing the Soviet Union to freely form a new Black Sea agreement with Turkey and Bulgaria. According to what the reporter heard in Moscow, plans for this Black Sea agreement have been underway for a long time. This formation, obstructing Germany's attempt to attack the Mesopotamian oil fields, will indirectly aid Britain. While the reporter was in Moscow, commercial delegations from Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Sweden, Finland, and Slovakia were conducting new trade negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Soviet Union Sympathizes with China's Resistance Against Japan

The Soviet people all believe that China's resistance against Japanese aggression is the only "just war" in the world's war history. Soviet sources believe and told the reporter that the Soviet Union's policy in the European war is neither pro-German nor pro-Allied. They said that the Soviet Union is merely taking advantage of the current opportunity to strengthen its position in the world. They believe that Britain will not succumb to Germany, and that the European war will not end in the shortest possible time. They said that the European war will spread into a global conflict, and that the Soviet Union will not decide which side to join until the United States enters the war. (Note: This manuscript was sent by our correspondent in Europe, Mr. Roth, from Tokyo. Mr. Roth, after the Battle of Narvik in Norway, transferred via Moscow on the Siberian Railway to reach Tokyo.)

UK and Soviet Rapprochement Possible

Stockholm, Sweden: Today's editorial in the "Social Democratic Newspaper" stated that due to the strength of the British working class, a renewed rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union is possible, and Japan's policy in the East is also a major factor contributing to this rapprochement. If Britain is no longer a powerful force in Asia, it will have far-reaching consequences, and the Soviet Union will also be significantly affected. Therefore, Churchill's recent hint that Britain will take the offensive after repelling the invasion suggests that Britain hopes to form a new grand alliance sooner or later to counter the triangular alliance of Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo. As for the rumors of a peace offer from the Axis powers, if true, it seems to prove that Berlin and Rome, while threatening to invade Britain, have some hesitation in their hearts.

### Soviet Shipbuilding Accelerates

Moscow: The Soviet newspaper "Red Fleet" reported yesterday that the speed of Soviet naval construction has now reached its peak. Since 1937, the Soviet Union's naval construction achievements have increased tenfold compared to before. Within these three years, the Soviet Union's shipbuilding will aim to reach the world's first position. Although the Soviet Union's submarine quantity and quality both exceed those of the world's largest naval powers, Soviet submarine construction can no longer maintain the same rate as some other countries. The Soviet Union will also greatly expand the construction of surface warships. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

### Japan's War Expenditure in China Reaches 16 Million Yuan Daily, Financial Situation Plunges into Difficulties, Laborers' Lives Suffer, Affecting Social Security

Moscow: "Pravda" today prominently published an article discussing the lives of Japanese workers, stating that the three-year war of aggression against China has greatly impacted Japan's economy and the lives of its laborers. Japan spends an average of 16 to 17 million yen daily on the war. As a result of the war of aggression against China, its domestic gold reserves have been depleted. Although the number of workers in war industries has increased, the number of unemployed people nationwide has also greatly increased. The future of the unemployed in Japan is extremely bleak, and they inevitably face chronic starvation. Prices in Japan have risen sharply, while wages have fallen, greatly affecting the living standards of workers. The employment of women and child laborers in Japanese factories is not limited to the silk industry; it is also common in other large-scale factories. Women's wages are far lower than men's, and the meager wages of child laborers are even more negligible. The means of exploitation in Japanese factories have been exploited to the highest degree. A large number of Japanese workers are deprived of holidays, and workers often work more than fourteen hours a day. As a result, the mortality and disease rates of workers have increased. During the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's mortality rate has increased, while the birth rate has fallen. In recent years, factory accidents have also increased, due to poor worker health, outdated machinery, and a fundamental lack of safety equipment. The authorities are indeed implementing high-pressure policies on workers, but strikes are still on the rise. If they want to curb the dissatisfaction of the workers in the future, it will inevitably become more difficult. Japan's current difficult situation is unprecedented. If this situation continues to worsen, even throwing the entire population into prison will not eliminate social chaos. (Dispatch on the 18th)

### Human Freedom Severely Threatened, Roosevelt Issues Declaration, Unwilling to Lightly Shirk Responsibility, Willing to Devote All Efforts to Serve the Country, Wallace Elected Vice Presidential Candidate

Washington: President Roosevelt formally accepted the Democratic Party's nomination as its candidate for the upcoming presidential election last night, stating that he cannot refuse to be called upon to serve in public office. In his broadcast address to the Democratic National Convention last night, President Roosevelt declared, "If the American people accept the Democratic Party's nomination and determine that I should serve another four years as president, I will continue to devote all my efforts to public service." The President continued, "The power to nominate me as president rests with the people, and must be done through the free election methods of the United States. If the people, based on this free nomination method, elect me as president, I will certainly take on this position. However, this matter rests with the entire nation, not with the Democratic Party. My speech tonight is delivered with the utmost sincerity. I feel two different emotions at this moment, intertwined and conflicting. On the one hand, I personally desire to retire, and on the other hand, I am driven by my conscience. Recalling that I was elected as president for the second term in 1936, I greatly desired to hand over the responsibilities of the government to others after the end of my term. Since last September, I have clearly intended to announce that I have no intention of accepting re-election. However, I later felt that it would be unwise to make such a statement, and until the last moment, I considered whether or not I should express my personal political views for discussion within the party. I finally came to the reluctant conclusion that a declaration of these views should not be put before the Democratic Convention. Today, I am very grateful for your respect for me, but I know that you must understand the true meaning of what I say, which is that it is not merely an internal party nomination; I must be able to accept the real decision and do what I should do, not accept the party's nomination but accept the final will of the voters. Because tens of millions of citizens will be engaged in national defense, many people of sound judgment will unanimously agree that the personnel required today are like the personnel of 1917 and 1918. Every American is willing to participate in the defense of America. Neither justice nor efficiency can allow this great cause to be entrusted to any party or any group. I have spent many sleepless nights lying in bed asking myself whether I have the power as commander-in-chief of the army and navy to summon the men and women of the country to serve the country, or to train these men and women to serve the country. If the people of the country want me to do this, am I personally capable of doing it? In the current era, the fact that dominates the world is a kind of effective armed aggression, and aggression against various political organizations and societies that are the same as those chosen by the United States. This is not an ordinary war, but a violent revolution that threatens all mankind. This revolution is not a revolution to liberate mankind, but a revolution to enslave mankind. We face this kind of crisis, and no one can maintain or hope to maintain the personal choices enjoyed by free people in peacetime. All of this is what I think about every day. I am now telling you that, as I have been called upon to serve in public office, my conscience will not allow me to refuse. However, the power to entrust me with public office rests with the people, and this power should be exercised through the free election methods of the United States. Only the people themselves can elect the president. If I am elected, I dare to say directly and clearly that I will continue to do my best to serve the country." The President then spoke about domestic issues, saying, "We all know that the progress of our country and other countries in the Americas towards human freedom has been severely threatened by the events on other continents. Many countries in Europe have abandoned their inherent democratic politics due to the oppression of dictatorship or aggression, and have been forced to adopt what they call 'new and effective' political systems. Democratic America and some unconquered democratic countries are unwilling to surrender to this so-called 'safe and effective' political system. If, next January, an inexperienced 'novice' is replaced to preside over the government, we only hope that the one who presides over the government will not adopt an appeasement policy, and compromise with those who attempt to destroy all democratic countries. If I can continue to serve in public office, I will do my best to prevent the threat of war. The rights and wrongs of what I have done in the past to maintain peace in America and so on, I can only leave to the judgment of my people. We are already facing a major choice in history. This is not only a choice of government, but also a choice to maintain the survival of our culture, so that it will not be destroyed by the aggressors. In other words, what we are facing now is the choice between religion and atheism, the choice between justice and force, the choice between morality and vice, the choice between courageous action and misguided appeasement. The American people should decide what things are worth sacrificing, and these decisions cannot be empty words but must be put into action." (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

### Wallace Accepts Nomination and Delivers Speech

Chicago: As a result of the American Democratic Party's nomination of a candidate for Vice President, Wallace (from Iowa) was elected, with a total of 1,095 votes, and Wallace alone received 665 votes. (Haitong dispatch on the 19th)

Chicago: US Secretary of Agriculture Wallace last night expressed his acceptance of the Democratic Party's nomination as a candidate for Vice President. The main purpose of his speech accepting the nomination was to continue to support the New Deal. Wallace promised to continue to work hard to achieve world peace, reduce unemployment, and restore farm prices. Wallace advocated active preparation in military, moral, and social aspects to maintain America's peace and democracy. Wallace said, "We must not allow totalitarianism to directly enter our country's borders, or to enter our country through our neighbors to the north and south. The courage and wisdom that has maintained our country's democratic politics for eighty years should allow it to continue for another four hundred and eighty years." Although the Chairman of the Convention, Farley, firmly opposed President Roosevelt's third term and supported the head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Jones, as Vice President, Wallace still greatly praised Farley. Wallace praised the achievements of the New Deal over the past seven years, but said that equality of agricultural income has not yet been achieved, unemployment has not been eliminated, and the world is not at peace. Wallace finally mentioned Roosevelt's nomination, saying, "President Roosevelt's talent in consolidating national defense and maintaining national security is unmatched. There is no one in the country who can compare to President Roosevelt. It is the duty of all of us to elect President Roosevelt as the next president. I now respectfully accept your nomination." (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

Chicago: Last night, when the name of Secretary of Agriculture Wallace was proposed to the Democratic Convention for nomination as a candidate for Vice President, a debate arose in the convention hall. Farley, the Chairman of the Democratic Convention who had hoped to be elected president but was defeated by Roosevelt, immediately expressed his opinion attacking Wallace. After Farley expressed his opinion, Oklahoma Representative Welch immediately stood up amidst the uproar and proposed the name of Federal Security Administrator McNutt, who had already withdrawn from the election. McNutt then, with a solemn expression, pushed through the crowd and stepped onto the podium. After repeatedly urging the crowd to stop the commotion, he declared that he would support Wallace.

### Mass Rallies in the Three Baltic States Demand Annexation to the Soviet Union

Tallinn: Mass rallies were held in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, demanding the adoption of the Soviet Constitution and joining the Soviet Union.

### Important Stronghold in the English Channel, Island of Ushant Occupied by German Forces, German Side Claims Completion of Arc-Shaped Encirclement, Fierce Air Battles Occur Over British Isles

Berlin: The island of Ushant, off the coast of Brittany in France, is a strategically important stronghold. It has now been occupied by Germany, becoming an excellent base for attacking the British Isles. With this location in German hands, the sea lanes of Britain will be greatly threatened. Germany has now achieved a balance of power in Norway and Brittany, and can launch a full-scale general offensive against the British Isles, as Brittany has fallen into Germany's arc-shaped encirclement. Furthermore, according to the German High Command yesterday, Orkdolf in Britain was heavily bombed by German planes, and many British merchant ships were destroyed. (International dispatch on the 19th)

London: The German Air Force launched a large-scale offensive against England, Scotland, and Wales yesterday, resulting in several deaths and countless injuries. However, the active situation in Britain has not diminished at all. German planes are bombing British cities all day long, and bombing Scotland at night. At the same time, the British side is implementing new defense laws, and tens of thousands of troops are guarding along the coast without the slightest slackening. It is rumored that Sunday is "the time when military operations begin." Wales suffered the heaviest casualties, where a German bomber was shot down. The Gibraltar Gazette reported that there were three deaths and countless injuries in several bombings there. British air force personnel are also busy, bombing German airfields in the Merville Henquetin area, and also bombing oil depots in Gelsenkirchen and Kent. British air force personnel in Boston said that reports of heavy losses in the air raids on Plymouth, Pembroke, and Cardiff last week have been dismissed by British intelligence as gross exaggerations. A spokesman for the intelligence service said that the areas that suffered the greatest damage were on the German-Dutch border. The British people no longer believe in German propaganda, and they whisper to each other, "Hitler has indefinitely postponed his invasion." (International News Service dispatch on the 19th)

British Air Force Retaliates Against Germany

London: When German planes attacked Britain yesterday, the British Air Force quickly dispatched aircraft to penetrate deep into German territory and the occupied territories to bomb. Yesterday, the areas attacked in Britain included Wales, northeast Scotland, southwest, southeast, and southern England. At least four German planes were shot down, including a Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance aircraft. This was the first aircraft of this type to participate in the attack on Britain. When it appeared off the south coast, it was attacked by a Hurricane fighter. After a brief engagement, the plane flew low, smoking, and half out of control. When Wales was bombed, four schoolchildren were almost killed. Yesterday afternoon, a German plane flew to a town in southwestern England and dropped two bombs, both of which landed in the fields, causing minor damage to houses and some casualties. When a German plane flew over the northeast coast of Scotland, it dropped several bombs, also injuring several people and killing one person. According to the announcement by the Ministry of Internal Security, there was no major damage in the bombings of southwestern and southern England. A town on the southwest coast was attacked, with slight casualties. A German plane then flew to northeastern England and strafed a cottage. A German plane also attempted to attack a small vessel off the southeast coast of England without success, but one plane was shot down. Another German plane was severely damaged over a town and was probably unable to return to base. It was reported that a German plane attacking southeastern Scotland was shot down last night. A coastal aircraft was scouting over the English Channel and lost one plane. Other British planes dispatched to search encountered a German bomber and shot it down. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, British Air Force bombers continued to fly over Dutch and Belgian territory to bomb ships and airfields, as well as oil depots in the Ruhr area. Coastal aircraft attacked oil tanks in Ghent, and the bombs hit and started a fire. All British aircraft returned safely. The weather was bad last night, making bombing difficult, so several planes returned with their bombs without finding targets. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

### East African Italian Forces Continue to Advance Towards Buna, Occupying Salient Positions of British Forces; Abyssinian South Bombed

Rome – Italian forces, after fiercely attacking Kenya and occupying Mojale, continue to advance towards Buna, having occupied salient positions of the British forces, shortening the battle lines by 300 kilometers. Military experts assert that the British forces face difficulties in defending Turkana Province and northern Kenya. Due to a lack of water sources at the front, British forces have been forced to retreat 100 to 150 kilometers. It is very difficult for British forces to construct defensive works. Italian forces will utilize their experiences from the Italian-Abyssinian War and use mechanized units to attack the British forces. Buna has a road leading to the Italian seaport of Kismayo. If Italian forces occupy Buna, they can shorten the supply lines. The Italian offensive is having a psychological impact on the local population. Among the 150,000 Indians in East Africa, there are signs of active anti-British sentiment. (Reuter's telegram, 19th)

Cairo – A communique issued here last night stated that on July 17, a small detachment of British light mechanized forces destroyed several enemy artillery pieces and a truck in the Kapso area of the western desert. An enemy transport column, escorted by tanks, was shelled near the Kapso battery, losing eleven trucks, several of which were full of soldiers. Mersa Matruh and Sidi Barrani were again bombed by enemy aircraft, with no losses. Wajir in the Kenya region was also heavily bombed, but without losses or casualties. There is nothing else to report elsewhere, including Sudan and Somaliland. (Reuter's telegram, 19th)

### Triumphant Return of the Berlin First Division to Berlin, Goebbels Delivers Welcome Speech

Berlin – The Berlin Brandenburg First Division, having triumphantly returned from Poland and France, entered the German capital last night through the Brandenburg Gate. At that time, war drums were pounding, military music was playing loudly, and the bells of all the city's churches were ringing. The troops were warmly welcomed by the Berlin district leader in the beautifully decorated Paris Square. German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, representing the Head of State, the government, and the German people, and General Froland, commander of the reserve forces, represented the German army in welcoming the triumphant troops. The Berlin soldiers, having been away from home for ten months, marched on Unter den Linden for more than two hours amidst the cheers of the Berlin citizens. This is the sixth time that German triumphant troops have passed through the Brandenburg Gate, but the welcome they received was the grandest of all. Although news of the troops' return home was only announced yesterday morning, almost all of the Berlin citizens gathered at the city gate to welcome their German fathers, sons, brothers, and friends. The roads through which the troops passed were transformed overnight into magnificent triumphal arches by the efforts of thousands of workers. The Place de Paris was the center of the celebration for this unprecedented ceremony and was transformed into a festive venue within hours. The surrounding thoroughfares of Brandenburg were decorated with German military flags and flags of Greater Germany. Huge platforms were built on both sides of the square, decorated with gold ribbons. Dr. Goebbels delivered a welcome speech to the German troops from one of the platforms. Before the troops arrived, citizens were already waiting respectfully by the roadside. When the first unit arrived, the crowd roared with cheers. The entire unit, led by the division commander, entered the capital through the central gate. All the vehicles were decorated with flowers. The division commander's car led the way, followed by the cars of the staff, and then the infantry. All the soldiers were full of energy. As they marched, the sound of their combat boots filled the air. General Froland first delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the German army, followed by Goebbels, who said that the homeland they saw would be the same as when they left. Finally, they gave a warm cheer to the Head of State and the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army. (Reuter's telegram, 19th)

### British Cabinet Members Prepare to Stay Overnight in Their Offices

### Ciano Arrives in Berlin at the Invitation of the German Government

### The United States Opens an Air Force Base in Alaska

Due to the increasingly serious Far East problem, the Naval Department is speeding up the construction of that airfield in Alaska as a precaution. Two seaplane bases, one in Sitka and the other in Kodiak, began construction last fall at a total cost of $12,739,000 and are scheduled to be completed within three years.

The third seaplane haven is Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. Currently, there is only a naval radio station and a small number of residents. No permanent naval construction is underway or planned.

The strategic value of these seaplane bases is extremely important. Aircraft taking off from these airfields can patrol most of the North Pacific, protect American coastal commerce, and prevent enemy attacks. The latest seaplanes can fly a distance of 1,200 to 1,500 miles, so these aircraft can scout almost to the far reaches when taking off from Kodiak and Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands.

Seaplanes can take off from Seattle, arrive at Sitka, and then westward to Kodiak. Sitka is 553 miles from Kodiak. A direct line from Seattle to Kodiak is only 1,237 miles. However, because the entire route is in the ocean, and the climate in that area is extremely harsh, the Naval Department decided to divide the flight to Kodiak into two stages. It is hoped that an auxiliary aircraft station will be built at Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island, but this project has not yet begun.

According to the Naval Department's original plan, Kodiak was originally a secondary base, but most of its equipment is of a first-class base. It is expected that within three years, it can accommodate two squadrons of reconnaissance aircraft, and three squadrons in emergencies. There will also be barracks, warehouses, and aircraft repair machines. The area's extremely cold and windy climate makes warehouses a necessity for the 24 permanently stationed aircraft.

Kodiak's climate is extremely harsh, but it is still better than elsewhere in Alaska. The climate around Dutch Harbor and the Aleutian Islands is even worse. Therefore, Kodiak is the best location for a naval air base in Alaska.

The development of the Kodiak airfield is now underway, including large-scale dredging work, so that a seaplane barge can be sent to Kodiak if necessary. After the dredging project is completed, the site can also be used as a submarine base.

After the Unalaska base is developed in the future, the activities of reconnaissance aircraft in the North Pacific can be extended by at least 500 miles, which will inevitably be more effective in dealing with hostile forces in the Far East.

The Naval Department once considered using Kodiak as a land-based aircraft base. Although land-based airfields can have many conveniences, the frequent heavy fog there would make land-based aircraft operations extremely dangerous, so this plan has been abandoned. Seaplanes can use blind flying and land on the sea surface 10 to 15 miles away, and then be towed into the warehouse.

The equipment at the Sitka airfield is intended for the use of aircraft flying along the coast to the Kodiak airfield area and its reconnaissance aircraft, and can also be used temporarily by several aircraft squadrons if necessary. Aircraft traveling to and from Kodiak may stay for several days if necessary due to the bad weather. Therefore, several barracks, warehouses, and storage facilities will be built to become a perfect base.

In addition to this, the United States and Canada have also begun discussing defense issues. The most important of these is the construction of an international highway to connect Canada and Alaska. President Roosevelt and the Canadian authorities discussed this issue at Warm Springs. The highway is 1,200 miles long and will cost $14 million to build.

Alaska, located in a remote area with a sparse population, is the most vulnerable point of the United States and Canada. Once Japan or Russia invades from Asia, Alaska will bear the brunt. After the international highway is built, it will be convenient for the United States to transport troops and supply the garrison. In a few years, it can also help develop Alaska's human and financial resources, making it independent in preventing foreign invasions.

The obstacle to building the highway is the funding issue. Canada is unwilling to accept this burden while fighting Germany. Most of the funding should be borne by the United States.

It is not known whether President Roosevelt will submit this issue to Congress this year, but he has requested that Congress extend the term of the International Highway Bureau, which is chaired by Democratic Congressman Magnuson and cooperates with similar Canadian agencies. The bureau's annual report stated that building a highway is a worthwhile project to pursue. It is a very important factor in developing the natural resources of Alaska and northern British Columbia, and it makes a great contribution to the welfare of the residents and the development of a vast new area.

This move can also increase the income of railway and shipping companies, develop Alaska's commercial aviation, and promote friendship between the people of the United States and Canada. Construction is also very easy to implement. The engineering problems have long been solved. However, the negotiations between the U.S. International Highway Bureau and the Canadian International Highway Bureau have not yet reached a concrete agreement on the issue of construction costs and routes.

### The Situation in Hong Kong is Tense and Uncertain

Hong Kong Correspondence: While the French government accepted Japan's unreasonable demands, prohibiting Chinese and foreign goods from being transported through Vietnam, Japanese troops in Guangdong Province again invaded Shenzhen, Nantou, and even Shatoujiao and Shayuchong, approaching the Fenling area belonging to Hong Kong. Although the Japanese army had notified the Hong Kong military authorities that the Japanese army would not move closer to the Hong Kong border, in reality, the Hong Kong border has been threatened. Moreover, the only transportation line between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province is Shayuchong, which is almost severed.

Since the Japanese army has advanced to that area, it will cut off the transportation line, which is tantamount to completing the encirclement of Hong Kong from the outside. Therefore, in the past half-month, the goods that Hong Kong relied on Vietnam and Guangzhou Bay and Shayuchong in Guangdong Province to transport have all been suspended. At the same time, Japan has made the same demands on Britain as it did on France, prohibiting Chinese and foreign goods from entering and exiting Hong Kong and Burma. As a result, the Japanese army on the Hong Kong border is becoming more active, and the army and navy are appearing in Bao'an and Daya Bay to support the Japanese troops in Shenzhen and Shatoujiao. The Hong Kong authorities, in order to stabilize the border area and

to be prepared for any eventuality, are increasing troops and transporting equipment in the Fenling area on the one hand, and the Volunteer Defence Corps are also heading to assist in the defense. On the other hand, they are rushing to build artillery forts in the Western District and Eastern District, and are also confiscating civilian weapons. As a result, people's hearts are shaken, and the prices of daily necessities are rising, and financial prices are also falling. It is said that this serious situation occurred when the Japanese army first invaded Shenzhen in September of last year, and it is now being seen again. The most important task of the Hong Kong authorities at the moment is to evacuate the population. The methods are divided into two aspects: one is British women and children, who are

being forcibly evacuated. The first batch is the families of British soldiers, the second batch is the families of European Volunteer Defence Corps members, and the third batch is the families of general women and children of Fuyou籍 (a surname). The first batch began to withdraw to the Philippines on the first of this month, and the remaining batches are also withdrawing to an island in Africa or Australia. The other is Chinese women and children, but only the dependents of British-Chinese who have made contributions to Hong Kong or Chinese who have made contributions to Hong Kong are allowed. Other Chinese are advised to evacuate on their own. The poor people who have fled to Hong Kong from the mainland of Guangdong Province are also being sent back to their hometowns. American expatriates are now also withdrawing to the Philippines first. The Hong Kong army authorities have declared that this evacuation of the population is purely

a preventive measure and that the authorities are not concerned about the adverse effects of any deterioration in the situation. This is said to be due to the problem of rising food prices and the problem of public security. In short, the current situation in Hong Kong is indeed a scene of external relaxation and internal tension. Since the beginning of the Chinese war of resistance, a large number of important officials have moved their families to Hong Kong. Their dependents have also been leaving Hong Kong in droves in recent days, some to the United States or Honolulu, and others to the Philippines nearby. As for the wealthy Chinese merchants in Hong Kong, they are mostly calm because their property in Hong Kong cannot be moved, but they are only preparing to move elsewhere.

### Schools Sell Diplomas, Authorities Punish Severely; Detailed Measures for Student Status Certification Being Formulated

Since the local education administrative organs withdrew with the army, the student status of students in public and private secondary schools in the city has not been reviewed on a periodic basis, which has led to an increasing trend of youths seeking advancement in life, and the school authorities have rarely paid attention to the examination of entrance qualifications, and there are even those who regard education as a business, selling graduation diplomas to increase school income, and disregarding the law and discipline, to the extreme. The education sector of the city is now thoroughly investigating the matter, and once it is verified, it should be severely punished. It is also feared that it will be difficult to reach the eyes and ears, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life can report this kind of business at any time so that it can be investigated and severely punished. As for the consolidation of school student status, detailed measures for student status certification during extraordinary times are being drafted and will be announced and implemented in the near future.

### Qifan vs. Paramount Tonight - A Scene from the United Cup Basketball Tournament - Class Two: Tianxing vs. Xihua

Two basketball games in the United Cup Charity Basketball Tournament are scheduled for this afternoon. In Group A, Paramount will meet Qifan. The former has won all four games in the group and has not encountered an opponent, while the latter's lineup is depleted and loses every game. Therefore, the outcome of today's match is obvious. In another game in Group B, Xihua will face Tianxing. Xihua has former Guoguang players Qiu Xiaoci and Zhang Jinqiong, and its strength is very strong. Last time, it unfortunately lost to Xing by two points, which was due to bad luck. Tianxing defeated Shangxing by four points, so it is difficult to predict who will win today. The schedule and list of players are as follows:

Xihua - Tianxing (Class Two) 5:30 PM Zheng Zhifang

Qifan - Paramount (Class One) 6:30 PM

### Intense Artillery Battles in Zhenhai - Three Japanese Warships Sunk - A Small Number of Japanese Troops Landed and Were Annihilated - Chinese Artillery Units Transferred to the Front to Strengthen the Line - Postal and Telegraph Communication Between Shanghai and Ningbo is Open, But With Delays

Since the Japanese navy implemented a blockade of the Zhejiang and Fujian coasts, Japanese warships have been probing Zhenhai, and Japanese aircraft have been harassing various parts of Ningbo, the situation has become tense for a time. A Japanese warship was sunk by Chinese troops outside of Zhenhai a few days ago, and the Chinese authorities immediately transferred troops to provide reinforcements to increase defense and resolve to give the Japanese a hard blow. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency met with a prominent person from Ningbo in Shanghai and asked about the situation in Ningbo. According to him, he received a telegram from Ningbo saying that all was safe in Ningbo and that the rumors of Japanese troops landing in Zhenhai were completely inaccurate. However, today (i.e. yesterday), the Japanese warships anchored in Zhenhai bombarded the Chinese troops fiercely, and the Chinese troops also demonstrated their power and retaliated. The intensity of the artillery battles was unprecedented since the Japanese army first probed Zhenhai. It is said that as a result, two more Japanese warships were sunk and several were damaged. Seeing that the Chinese army's defense was well-organized, the Japanese army knew that it was difficult and retreated. Although Ningbo was strafed by Japanese aircraft today, the Chinese side suffered no losses and the residents are safe. Daxie Island near Chuanshan, Zhenhai, was also forcibly landed by Japanese troops a few days ago, but was also bravely repelled by the defending troops. However, it is reported that a Shanghai merchant received a telegram from Quanzhou yesterday afternoon, saying that "Quanzhou was bombed by Japanese aircraft at 10:00 AM yesterday, and the docks and warehouses were slightly damaged."

Coastal War Report

A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from Ningbo groups in Shanghai last night that on the morning of the 18th, Japanese warships gathered near Longshan Guanhaiwei and fired 26 shells at the coast, destroying several civilian houses. A shell also landed on a primary school in Hengshan, Yindong, but it did not explode. Three shells also landed in Xianxiang, damaging only a dozen houses. There were no other losses. The Japanese warships anchored at Huangniu Reef in Xiangshan Port also shelled the shore the other day. By yesterday morning, five Japanese warships anchored in the Likang waters outside Zhenhai had sailed northwest towards Hangzhou. More than 100 Japanese naval landing troops who landed in Xiaoyi Jiangnan outside Zhenhai had been annihilated by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops who landed at Guoshan Tou, Jinji Mountain, Chang Tiao Zui, and Dingyuan Fortress outside Zhenhai were also driven out by the army. However, there are still small groups of Japanese troops in Qingzhi, Zhenhai, who are currently being encircled and annihilated. In addition, the two small islands of Huang Mang Island and Qiliyi Island outside Zhenhai are isolated overseas. They are small in size and have no military value except for a lighthouse on Qiliyi Island, so there is absolutely no need to pay attention to them. Huang Shaoxian, the chairman of Zhejiang Province, believing that the situation in eastern Zhejiang is tense, has resigned from his position in the central government in Guilin and rushed back to eastern Zhejiang to take command, and is jointly planning defense with Liu Jianxu, the commander-in-chief of the □ Group Army. In recent days, the Central National Army of the Chinese side and the □□ Department have rushed to the front line in eastern Zhejiang, including a unit of artillery, so the coastal defense has become more consolidated. The people of Yongzhen are calm. The Zhenhai County Government and the County Party Department have moved back to the city to work.

Postal and Telegraph Communications

Shanghai-Ningbo telegrams, which were interrupted the other day, were quickly restored. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency learned yesterday from the American Global Wireless Electric Company (i.e., the American News Agency) that telegrams between Shanghai and Ningbo are still accessible. Due to the tense situation in Ningbo, merchants and personal friends and relatives between Shanghai and Ningbo are inquiring about news and safety, so communication is frequent and company business is more prosperous than usual. However, because the Ningbo authorities are evacuating people, it is uncertain whether the recipients in Ningbo will receive telegrams sent from Shanghai. If companies and individuals move to other places, then telegrams will naturally be difficult to receive. Light mail to cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang such as Jinhua, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Zhuji, Yuyao, Shangyu, Lanxi, Shengxian, Xinchang, Dongyang, Yiwu, Fenghua, Wenzhou, etc., cannot be transported due to the interruption of shipping, so mail to the above-mentioned areas since the 16th is still stored in the Bureau's warehouse. It is now reported that the first batch was shipped yesterday morning and rerouted through Fuzhou. In the future, all mail to eastern Zhejiang will be shipped by sea, and it will never be interrupted. However, the delivery time will be slightly longer. Mail to the southwest provinces and cities is still forwarded by the post office through the sea, and rumors of interruption or rerouting are inaccurate.

Japanese Warship Movements

Yesterday morning, many white leaflets issued in the name of "Japanese Fleet Headquarters Reporting Team" and other names were found in the Nanjing Road area. They stated the "reasons" for invading eastern Zhejiang, which was to cut off military supply routes. All of them were torn up by those who picked them up. However, according to people from Dinghai, in recent days, the Japanese troops stationed in Dinghai "Zhoushan Island Base Team" Laijima Shigeo unit have been repeatedly reinforced. It is said that they came from Shanghai. Four Japanese warships and one transport ship (transformed from a transport ship) are now anchored in front of the port, and small motorboats are sent out from time to time to patrol nearby. It is also reported that the commander of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai, Tomiguchi Shuichiro, arrived in Dinghai by ship the other day, attempting to plan an invasion of eastern Zhejiang.

Blocking Navigation at Likang

Gordonlun of the German firm Ruilin Foreign Trade Company was originally scheduled to sail to Likang, Zhejiang Seaport, last night, but suddenly changed. The company was unable to determine the exact sailing date. The British ship Maria Mahler was originally scheduled to sail to Songmen this morning, and the customs clearance procedures had been completed. It has now been ordered to sail to Haimen instead. Two oil tankers of the British firm Asiatic Petroleum Company reportedly sailed to Shanghai yesterday morning.

### Suburbs Gradually Opening Up - Flour Transported to Shanghai - Reportedly, the Japanese Side Agreed to an Agreement Yesterday - To Transport 18,000 Bags Per Day

According to reliable sources, after several weeks of negotiations, the barriers around Shanghai have recently been partially opened to allow flour to be transported into the Public Concession and save it from the flour shortage it has been suffering. Although the amount of flour transported in from the surrounding areas is not large, the crisis of the flour shortage has been lifted. It is said that the price of domestic flour is expected to fall below 15.5 yuan per bag (49 pounds) soon. According to an agreement reached between the Japanese side and the relevant parties in this city, starting next week, 18,000 bags of 110-pound Chinese flour will be allowed to be transported into the Public Concession daily. At the same time, a large quantity of wheat ordered from Australia and the United States will also arrive in Shanghai in August. Yesterday, the flour market in this city showed a clear response, and the price of flour fell to 22.5 yuan per bag, and at the lowest point, it fell to 21.5 yuan.

### New Hurricane - Continuing Towards Shanghai

The Pacific hurricane during the high tide period deserves attention. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, it has advanced to 21 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, heading northwest-west. The wind force center is within 120 nautical miles, and the wind heat is unknown. In addition, there is a high tide in this city, with heights of about 11 feet, which is worrying that it will coincide with the hurricane and requires attention.

### Hong Kong Situation Eases - Number of Passengers Decreases

Since the situation in Hong Kong became tense, foreign expatriate women and children took ships to evacuate, and many Chinese also moved away. However, the situation in Shanghai has eased, and the border with Shenzhen has calmed down, so the number of evacuees has decreased, and it is no longer as crowded as before. The tickets for various ships sailing from Hong Kong to Shanghai had originally been sold out until the 20th of the month, but many people have cancelled their tickets. In recent days, the number of passengers on ships such as the Jardine Shandong Taisheng, the Taikoo Niuzhuang Taiyuan, and the Jebsen Meizhou, all sailing to Shanghai, has decreased compared to before. The President Taft of the American President Mail Line is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong at 2:00 PM today and arrive in Shanghai. This ship will carry a group of evacuating American expatriate women and children, about 50 people, who will temporarily reside in Shanghai. However, the passengers' luggage is not as crowded as that of the President Coolidge.

### Dredger Jianshe to Inspect Hull - Machinery and Cabins Inspected - Work Can Begin Soon

The Jianghai Customs and the Shanghai Bureau manage the dredging of the Huangpu River. Work was halted after August 13th. After the Chinese army withdrew to the west, all the dredgers, large and small, were detained by the Japanese navy, which led to gradual siltation on both sides of the Huangpu River for the past three years. After the Customs made great efforts to negotiate with the Japanese side, the Japanese side allowed the Shanghai Bureau to reorganize and assign Japanese personnel to take charge. Since last month, two small dredgers have started work. The large dredger Jianshe, which was purchased in the United States to dredge the Xinzhentan outside the Wusong Estuary, has been docked at the Taikoo Company's floating pontoon at the Xinkai River, French Concession. Two months ago, it also began to inspect the machinery and the bottom and top of the cabins and paint the hull. It is now reported that this work has been completed. However, the hull has not been inspected for three years, so it was unmoored from the Taikoo pontoon on the morning of the other day and sailed to the south Huangpu. It is said that it will enter the Jiangnan Shipyard to inspect the hull. After the inspection is completed, it is expected that it will be able to start dredging work.

### Geneva Red Cross to Investigate - Those Missing in the European War - Relatives and Friends of Missing Prisoners and Civilians Can Entrust the Investigation

The Swiss Consulate General in Shanghai recently received a letter from the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva, stating that since the outbreak of the European War, the Committee has received many inquiries from the outside world about prisoners of war and missing residents due to the war. In the future, anyone who has relatives or friends missing due to the war can inquire with the Committee in Geneva, Switzerland, and it will do its best to investigate and reply.

### Coal Ball Costs Reduced - Retail Prices Should Fall Quickly

According to coal industry sources, the sharp drop in coal prices has seriously threatened coal merchants holding large quantities of spot goods, resulting in significant losses. The prices of various goods in the market are superficially tight but secretly loose, and the sources are also pouring in one after another, so inventories are increasing day by day. Therefore, the cost of coal ball production has been significantly reduced. Over the past few days, the wholesale prices of the same industry have been falling. Retail prices need to be lowered urgently, so it is hoped that the industry association will immediately convene representatives from each factory to discuss price reduction measures to reduce the burden on the common people.

### Brief News Summary

Cen Asan, stall vendor No. 29 at the Seymour Road vegetable market, was found to have added water to ducks again, a repeated offense.

Postal Bureau parcel notice: Yubei branch bureaus that were previously taken over by the Beiping District are now under the jurisdiction of the Kaifeng Henan Bureau. Furthermore, after investigation, the Beiping postal district now only has jurisdiction over the Nankou Bureau, the Baotou and its eastern line above the Pingyuan Road. For various bureaus to which these lines transfer, only scattered parcels from individuals can be accepted. However, when accepting parcels, the sender should be consulted to take responsibility.

Kunshan is a rice-producing area, but rice prices are high. Therefore, a public rice sales office was established, limiting the price to 4.5 jiao per liter. Unexpectedly, it was soon suspended, and rice stocks ran out, causing panic. Now flour is used instead, with 1.5 jin of flour equivalent to 1 liter of rice, and each jin is sold for 3 jiao. However, since residents are not accustomed to wheat-based foods, the price of flour sold has not been lowered, which has caused great dissatisfaction.

### The Board Member of the Da Mei Yi Bao and Da Mei Bao, Zhang Sixu, was Murdered Yesterday; He Died from Five Gunshots Before He Could Be Treated; His Body Was Sent to the International Funeral Home Yesterday

Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, a terrifying bloody incident occurred at Chesilhurst Coffee Shop, No. 72 Jing'an Temple Road. The victim was Mr. Zhang Sixu, a highly respected figure in both Chinese and foreign communities. He was also a director of Da Mei Printing Company, which publishes the Chinese and English Da Mei Evening News and Da Mei Bao, as well as a business manager at American International Assurance Company. He was shot five times and died a heroic death. The news sent shockwaves throughout Shanghai. Details are recorded below:

A Premonition Fulfilled Upon Arrival at the Coffee Shop Yesterday Morning

Given the recent special circumstances in Shanghai, Mr. Zhang's relatives and colleagues at the Da Mei Printing Company had repeatedly advised him to leave Shanghai. However, Mr. Zhang was deeply concerned about the safety of his colleagues and did not want to "live in seclusion." He had previously hired a bodyguard from the Shanghai Municipal Police, but dismissed him last week. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, Mr. Zhang left Da Mei after finishing his work and drove out. A Western colleague asked for a ride, to which Mr. Zhang jokingly replied, "If you are not afraid of death, you may come along." Little did he know that his jest would become a grim prophecy. Around 4:00 PM, he sent his driver to his residence to retrieve his sportswear and tennis racket.

Unexpected Tragedy at the Coffee Shop

At 4:30 PM, while Mr. Zhang was sitting alone and resting on the second floor of Chesilhurst Coffee Shop, two thugs suddenly rushed upstairs. Without a word, they attacked Mr. Zhang, who was unarmed, and opened fire. The sound of gunfire rang out. Mr. Zhang had no time to dodge and was immediately wounded and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. He silently succumbed to his injuries. Having achieved their aim, the thugs rushed out of the shop. A Polish gentleman named Krassnoff happened to be entering the coffee shop at that moment and bravely stepped forward to intercept one of the thugs. In desperation, the thug shot Krassnoff in the abdomen and fled. Krassnoff was rushed to Hong En Hospital for treatment but died at 6:45 PM.

Injuries to Vital Organs Prevented Rescue

Mr. Zhang's body was first sent to Hong En Hospital at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon, and then transferred to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. Reporters rushed to the scene, and a hospital attendant led them to the morgue opposite the hospital. After opening the door, the attendant slid open the wooden compartment where the body was placed. Mr. Zhang's body lay on the lowest shelf in the middle of the wooden cabinet. He was dressed in a light gray checkered silk long gown, soaked in bright red blood. His chest was exposed, and there were gunshot wounds on his right neck, right kidney, and arm. Mr. Zhang's body was transferred to the International Funeral Home yesterday. The Da Mei Printing Company will organize a funeral committee, and the date of the encoffining ceremony will be decided today.

Dedicated to the Newspaper Industry

Mr. Zhang was a director of Da Mei Printing Company, which publishes the Chinese and English Da Mei Evening News and Da Mei Bao, and also a business manager at American International Assurance Company. He was a native of Shantou, 44 years old, and a graduate of Shanghai Anglo-Chinese College. He studied at Harvard University and Ford University in the United States, earning a bachelor's degree, and later studied journalism at Columbia University. He returned to China in 1924 and joined the Tianjin North China Star as a reporter and later as an editor. He also taught at Soochow University. In 1927, when Ding Wenjiang was the Military Governor of Songhu, he was appointed as a First-Class Secretary in the Governor's Office. He later returned to his old profession, serving as the editor-in-chief of the Shanghai National News Agency. In 1930, he joined the Continental Daily News as an editor. In 1932, he was appointed Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the then Foreign Minister Chen Youren, a position he also held under Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan. After the end of the January 28th Incident, when China and Japan held negotiations, he assisted Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi in attending the Sino-Japanese Armistice Conference. After resigning from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he engaged in the insurance business until his tragic death. His wife is a Chinese expatriate from Salt Lake City, USA, and many of her relatives live there. Her mother's family are close friends with American Congressman King. He is survived by a twelve-year-old daughter who speaks three languages.

### Report on Legal Tender Reserves Published; Reserves are Sufficient; Rumors of Inflation Disproven by Facts

After the implementation of China's new monetary policy, the custody of legal tender reserves and the matters of issuance and redemption are handled by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee to ensure accuracy and credibility. The committee conducts monthly inspections according to the regulations. The Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Association has recently issued a decree from the Ministry of Finance, announcing the legal tender reserve inspection report of the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China) as of June 30, 1940. The total issuance of the four banks was 3,962,144,205 yuan, including cash reserves of 1,917,526,049.59 yuan and guarantee reserves of 2,044,618,155.41 yuan. The cash reserves are higher than those of most countries. The inspection results are in full compliance. Rumors of inflation in China have been proven to be completely inaccurate. Cash reserves remain sufficient, and all rumors have been dispelled.

### Yang Jinrui Kidnapped; Escapes Dangerously

The day before yesterday (the 18th) at around 3:00 PM, five Sikh constables (numbered 111, 212, 187, 430, and 594) from the Public Concession Police were on duty near the Aurora University on Fanhwangdu Road when a middle-aged man passed by in a rickshaw. As the rickshaw approached the constables, the man jumped out and shouted for help. The constables immediately stepped forward to inquire, but due to language barriers, they took the man to the police station. After questioning by the inspector, it was learned that the man was Yang Jinrui, the owner of Jin Tai Fashion Company at 301 Tongfu Road, who had been kidnapped on the 16th. According to Yang, he was kidnapped to a shed without a number on Route Brien in Western Shanghai and guarded by two armed bandits. He escaped from the bandit's den the day before yesterday while the two bandits were fast asleep.

### Wang Anlu, a Worker at This Newspaper, Was Encoffined Yesterday

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the encoffining ceremony was held at the Public Funeral Home. Many colleagues from the newspaper went to pay their respects. The coffin is prepared to be transported back to Suzhou for burial. His father is sixty-three years old, with white hair. His wife is thirty-four years old and left behind a daughter of only three years old. The family cried mournfully, and the scene was extremely tragic.

### Even Though the Cholera Season Has Not Yet Arrived, Citizens Should Still Take Precautions

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department's June report, two cases of true cholera were recorded last month. Since the cholera season is still early, it is difficult to determine how severe the situation will become in the future. Typhus fever has decreased due to the hot weather and is expected to decrease significantly next month. At the same time, the incidence of relapsing fever will also decrease. The incidence of typhoid fever is increasing. The Health Department has taken appropriate measures to ensure that the food sold in the market meets the standards of the Health Department. A total of 2,930 deaths of Chinese people were recorded, including 1,520 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. A total of 1,577 bodies were cremated, and 652 coffins were buried.

### The French Tramway Labor Strike; The Stalemate Remains; Iron Gates Continue to be Closed; Many Deaths by Drowning on Ferries; Labor and Management Resume Negotiations Without Concrete Results

Since more than 700 coppersmiths from the machine department of the French Tramway Company went on strike on the 17th and gathered in the Nanshi area to hold a meeting, the French Concession authorities reportedly received information that this strike had a "political" purpose. To maintain security within the concession, in addition to dispatching armored vehicles and a large number of detectives to closely guard around the tramway company, they also closed all iron gates in the French Concession leading to the Nanshi area the day before yesterday. These security measures had not been lifted as of yesterday and, due to the delay in the strike, have shown an increasingly serious trend. Yesterday, all the power distribution huts of the electric light company scattered across the roads in the French Concession were guarded by an Annamese constable with a gun. Other public utilities, such as the waterworks and power plants, have also had additional guards posted by the French police, with strict security measures that have not been relaxed at all.

Iron Gates Remain Closed All Day

Since the French Concession authorities suddenly closed all the iron gates at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Consulat the day before yesterday due to the strike by the coppersmiths of the tramway company, the situation suddenly became tense. It has greatly inconvenienced the residents and vendors traveling between Nanshi and the concession. Yesterday afternoon, this newspaper's reporter inspected the area from the Nanyang Bridge iron gate along the way and saw that each iron gate remained closed as before. At the New North Gate, Old North Gate, and other places with relatively heavy traffic in the past, there were three to five Vietnamese policemen stationed, guarding with guns. Looking from afar at places such as Mingguo Road and Liuxiangyuan Road, except for the occasional Japanese military vehicle speeding past, there were hardly any pedestrians, creating a desolate scene that filled people with a sense of the past and present.

Tragic Ferry Overturn Incident

Due to the closure of the iron gates, residents who want to travel between the south and middle of the concession must take ferries and detour around Pudong. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, due to interference by the Japanese puppet police at the South Wharf, the crowd rushed to get off the boat, and the weight of the boat lost its balance, causing three ferries to suffer an accident. Although many people were rescued, at least twenty to thirty people drowned.

Rumors that Striking Workers Will Resume Work

After the entire coppersmiths room workers went on strike on the 17th, the company representatives held negotiations with labor representatives at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 18th) in order to prevent the situation from escalating. The company authorities stated that they were willing to consider the labor demands but made it a condition to resume work first. The labor side insisted that they were unwilling to resume work unless all their demands were completely agreed to. As a result, the negotiations broke down. Yesterday morning, the two sides resumed negotiations, but there was no concrete result. However, it was rumored yesterday that the striking workers would resume work today or tomorrow, and it was said that the management had agreed to give the workers a raise of one yuan per day and thirty yuan per month. However, inquiries to the management did not confirm this statement.

Excessive Demands Displease the Company

Mr. Pfeifferly, the manager of the French Tramway Company, said that the number of striking workers was between 600 and 700. These workers had already received a raise a month ago, and after a short interval, they made demands again, and this time the demands were very excessive. In fact, the company's treatment of workers is no different from any other large company in Shanghai. It is rumored that the striking workers have requested the Chinese directors of the French Concession to serve as mediators. However, inquiries to the French Concession Taxpayers' Association and individual directors have revealed that they have not received a formal request.

Temporarily Hiring Russians to Repair Vehicles

The French Tramway Company is usually extremely busy due to its three businesses, the tramways, buses and trolleybuses. Especially the coppersmiths room etc. of the machine department, as all vehicles usually have damage after one day of running, must be repaired before they can be driven the next day. Therefore, their work is extremely important. But since the workers of the coppersmiths room went on strike, this work could not continue, resulting in a large number of vehicles waiting to be repaired in the factory for several days. Moreover, the impact may gradually reduce the number of vehicles in operation due to damage. In order to maintain the normality of public transportation, the company authorities specially recruited dozens of temporary Russian workers starting the day before yesterday to intensify their work and repair the vehicles that are damaged every day. Therefore, there is no need to worry about public transportation within the French Concession.

Workers Gathered in Nanshi Yesterday

Then the reporter walked to the Bund, took a private boat to the South Wharf to disembark, and entered the Nanshi area. Except that small businesses were relatively quiet due to the inconvenience of transportation, the residents were still able to maintain calmness and were not frightened by the closure of the iron gates. According to sources, the reason for the French Concession's closure of the iron gates this time was that most of the striking workers lived in the Nanshi area. In order to prevent the striking workers from being exploited and expanding the strike, the French Concession authorities closed all the iron gates to show resistance. It is heard that the striking workers still gathered at the Public Stadium yesterday morning and afternoon to discuss the proposed wage increase and requested the French authorities to approve it as soon as possible to avoid the situation from becoming increasingly serious and causing adverse consequences. However, when the reporter rushed to the Public Stadium, most of the workers had already dispersed. Later, after further inquiries by the reporter, the workers' request for a general 30% wage increase to be given by the company, after negotiation between the workers' representatives and the authorities, the company promised to consider it immediately and find a compromise solution. If the authorities can sincerely cooperate, the labor strike can be resolved smoothly today, and the iron gates in various places can be opened as usual.

### Manchurian Goods Smuggled into North China; Valued at 150 Million Japanese Yen Last Year; Opium Smuggling from Rehe is the Most Prevalent

The English Da Mei Evening News reported that, according to the Tokyo semi-official "Japan Times & Mail," although the Japanese side has recently tightened control at the passes along the Great Wall, Manchuria still has goods being smuggled into North China on a large scale. It is estimated that the value of smuggled goods last year was 150 million Japanese yen, most of which was opium. Opium smuggling from Rehe into North China is the most prevalent, resulting in a 50% loss in Rehe's normal opium tax revenue. The price levels in Manchuria and North China differ greatly, which is an important reason for the continued smuggling. The price of many goods south of the Great Wall is three times higher than that north of the Great Wall.

### Reinvestigation of the Japanese Military Police Detention Incident; Agreed Upon by the Result of Baker and Miura Consultations

The Times reported that U.S. Navy 4th Marine Regiment Commander Colonel Baker has begun a detailed investigation into the case of the U.S. defense forces detaining sixteen Japanese military police. Japanese authorities believe that if necessary, the Japanese side can allow the sixteen military police who were arrested at the time to testify. According to authorities, this decision was the result of several days of consultations between Colonel Baker and Japanese Military Police Commander Major Miura.

Japanese Consul Sends Letter to US Consul General

Regarding the case of two Japanese nationals being beaten by soldiers of the U.S. Navy 4th Marine Regiment in the Oriental Cafe last Sunday, Japanese Consul-General Yoshiaki Miura has sent a letter to the U.S. Consul-General. Based on the results of the Japanese consular police investigation, the letter recounts the details of the incident and requests the U.S. Consul-General to discipline the two soldiers who "committed the crime" and to "rectify discipline" to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. At the same time, on behalf of the two injured Japanese, he reserves the right to demand compensation for losses.

### British Gas Company Workers Go on Strike; Demand Improved Treatment from the Company; The Stalemate Continues as Management Refuses to Accept

The British Gas Company at 565 Yuqiaqing Road had a strike by all employees on April 17 of this year due to demands for improved treatment from the management, which was resolved satisfactorily through mutual understanding between both sides. However, yesterday at 9:00 AM, the company's workers suddenly went on strike again. The reporter of the Pingming News Agency interviewed and learned the details as follows:

Cause of the Strike

According to the workers of the company, since the company accepted the workers' demands in April of this year, the workers believe that the company authorities have not fulfilled the obligations of the conditions. Recently, the company dismissed Yang Hanzhang, a worker in the coppersmiths department, on the pretext that the company authorities ordered the workers in the coppersmiths room to do other work, which was rejected by the workers. Some workers, given the soaring rice prices, submitted a written request to the engineer, Mr. Samson, on the 17th of this month, requesting a further increase in wages, which was rejected. Therefore, all the workers went on strike at 9:00 AM yesterday, and the strike is in a stalemate.

Workers' Demands

It is learned that the labor side has submitted 16 conditions to the company for improved treatment. The contents are as follows: (1) A temporary allowance of 50%, including monthly overtime hours, shall not be less than 15 yuan (excluding commodity allowances); (2) If the rice price is above 20 yuan, the workers will pay the company 20 yuan per month, and the company will issue one picul of No. 2 Saigon rice; (3)

Annual increase

The wages will be increased by 10%, restoring the 5% wage increase made in 1936, and another 10% wage increase will be added. In the future, the factory should give a special wage increase to each worker who has worked for 15 years or more; (4) Bank holidays, wages will be paid as usual. If they work as usual, they will be paid double wages. Saturday's wages will be paid as usual, and four corners will be given for transportation if the worker lives far away, or the factory will send a car to pick them up; (5) Workers shall not be dismissed without reason. If the factory

Intends to dismiss

Should notify one month in advance and pay a severance fee of six months, and the savings will be calculated in accordance with the regulations; (6) The annual bonus should be one month's salary, and new and old workers are treated the same. Those who have not worked for a full year will be calculated on a monthly basis; (7) Apprentices who have worked for more than three years must be paid according to the wages of technicians; (8) Workers who work outside the factory shall be given two sets of uniforms and one set of rain gear; (9) Temporary workers who work in the factory as technicians for more than three months may be promoted to permanent workers, and the allowance must be calculated according to permanent workers; (10) The working hours of the three shifts were originally

Eight hours

Calculated, with two days off per month, or a raise of two days' wages; (11) Each worker should have two weeks of vacation per year, with wages paid as usual. If a worker works for one year without taking leave, the factory should pay an additional week's wages, "except for sick leave"; (12) If a worker is injured on duty, wages will be paid as usual during the medical treatment period, including all allowances. If the injury is severe and results in disability, the factory will pay a pension for ten years, calculated according to the last month's wages, or pay wages on a monthly basis until the worker's children

When they are sixteen years old

Can enter the factory to work. If they die due to military service, the factory will pay for funeral expenses and a pension, which shall not be less than 1,000 yuan; (13) The savings should be calculated at 10% of the annual salary. If they have worked for more than 15 years, they will be taken out in one lump sum; (14) For the sake of labor-management cooperation, the factory should recognize the club that the employees promote for appropriate entertainment, and the factory should provide expenses of 200 yuan per month (half for the new and old factories); (15) The dismissed worker representatives should restore the work they originally did on the same day; (16) The company should give gas stoves to the workers in each department for steaming and frying lunch.

### Negotiations on Police Authority in Hongkou; Complications Arise; Even Involving Judicial Issues; No Hope of Reaching an Agreement Temporarily

The Shanghai Municipal Council has been unable to implement police authority in Hongkou. In March of this year, the Council negotiated with the Japanese side to return the police authority. The Japanese side argued that areas such as North Sichuan Road and Dixiwei Road in District E are where the Japanese congregate and that Japanese people should be police chiefs. The Shanghai Municipal Council did not insist on this point either. The Japanese Consul-General and the Shanghai Municipal Council reached an agreement. Months have passed since then, and it has still not been realized. According to those who know the inside story, there are also judicial issues involved. The opinions of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side differ, and the dispute is unresolved, which is a major reason for the failure to implement it. The negotiations have now stalled, and it is feared that it will be difficult to restore police authority north of the Suzhou River for a while.

### Chapellain Arrives in Haiphong; Inspects Yunnan-Vietnam Postal Transport; Negotiates Parcel Transport on That Route

After the coastal ports of Vietnam and Zhejiang and Fujian were all blockaded, parcels and heavy items have all stopped being accepted. The Postal Service will appeal the issue, hoping to restore the delivery of parcels and heavy items to the inland via Vietnam or elsewhere. According to the Postal Service, it will do its best to take all hopeful measures to facilitate restoration. However, all specific decisions must wait until Director Chapellain arrives in Shanghai to make them. Mr. Chapellain recently inspected the highway in Haiphong, which may be related to the restoration of parcel transport.

### Gangsters Hijacking Cars One After Another; Car Rental Companies Suffer Heavy Losses; Vehicles Falling into the Hands of Gangsters Are Rarely Returned; This Kind of Danger Needs to be Prevented

The Shanghai Times reported that, in recent weeks, a new threat has gradually emerged in the social life of this city, that is, armed gangsters are hijacking taxis one after another, causing car rental companies to feel anxious. After the gangsters hijacked the cars and used them for various crimes, some cars were returned, but

Hijacked vehicles Mostly Disappear Without a Trace and Have Not Been Found. Based on the current exchange rate, the value of hijacked cars is quite large, so various car rental companies feel that if they continue to suffer this kind of loss, they may be forced to close down. In the past three weeks, three cars from the Xiang Sheng Company were hijacked, one of which has been returned, and the other two are still missing.

Estimated Losses About 30,000 Yuan. The Taile Company has also lost two cars in recent weeks, and it is not difficult for gangsters to hijack cars, so it is urgent to find a way to remedy this. It is suggested that a signal light be installed on the car. If the driver suspects that the passenger is behaving improperly, he can turn on the light to prompt the police to pay attention, while not arousing the passenger's suspicion. Various rental companies feel that if the gangsters find that they can continue to hijack cars and

Go Scot-Free , Then They Will Hijack Indefinitely. This Kind of Danger is a Deep Concern for Car Rental Companies. Gangsters Hijack Cars Mostly at Night, So It Is Not Easy to be Arrested. Therefore, It is also suggested that Police be dispatched to remote locations to constantly patrol and carefully inspect the vehicles, and they must be especially careful at night in order to solve this problem. Once a Car Falls into the Hands of Gangsters, it is even more difficult to find.

### The Case of the Head Nurse's Sudden Death: Dispute Over Possessions; Family Insists on Returning Possessions, Hospital Asks to Deduct Debts

Li Yuying, also known as Li Jieru, the head nurse of the Sino-Western Sanitarium at 536 Route Ghisi, in the French Concession, suddenly died in her bedroom at the hospital on the night of June 10, the Dragon Boat Festival by the lunar calendar. The next day, it was discovered that Lu Zhenqing, the steward of the hospital (son of the hospital director Lu Zhong'an), did not report the death to the police according to regulations, nor did he seek the family's consent. Instead, he instructed Lin Zhengliang, a Western doctor at the hospital, to issue a certificate stating death due to stroke, notified the Chinese Funeral Home, sent a hearse to the funeral home for coffin preparation, and planned for burial in the Hongqiao Cemetery. All of this was arranged by Zhang on his behalf, without allowing the family to intervene. After someone sent a letter to the French Concession police to report the matter, the coffin was sent to the coroner's office, and a request was made to the Second Special District Court to send personnel to open the coffin for examination and to take the stomach for testing. The Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, considering that Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang had forged the death certificate, recently had Zhao Changmin,

the prosecutor, issue summons for Lu and Lin to appear in court for questioning. Lu was ordered to pay 1,000 yuan in cash, and Lin was ordered to pay 800 yuan in cash. In addition, each had to provide a guarantor to ensure their availability for questioning as needed. As for the 8,700 yuan in cash, four gold bracelets, over 200 pieces of clothing, and other items left by the deceased, Lu was instructed to hand them over to the deceased's father, Li Shizhen, for receipt. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, Lu Zhenqing claims that the deceased owed the hospital over 10,000 yuan during her lifetime and that the family must settle the account before the possessions can be returned. Otherwise, the money from the possessions will be used to offset the debt. This has led to a stalemate between the two parties. The family has again submitted a petition to the Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, requesting a strict order to return the clothing and cash. Therefore, yesterday morning, the prosecutor again issued summons for Lu Zhenqing, Lin Zhengliang, and the deceased's parents, Li Shizhen and Madam Li Lin, to appear in court for questioning. One side insisted on an order for the return of the money and possessions, while the other maintained that the account must be settled before the items can be handed over. The court ordered both parties to negotiate a settlement outside. Regarding the criminal aspect, it is heard that the Prosecutor's Office intends to prosecute for the crime of forging documents. If the hospital insists on refusing to return the possessions, the family will file a lawsuit for embezzlement and request their return.

### Scorching Weather, Cholera Outbreak, Authorities Urged to Pay Attention

On the 17th alone, nine people suddenly contracted cholera and were sent to the Isolation Hospital for treatment.

### Bombing Thugs, Trial Not Held Yesterday

On the morning of the 16th of this month, at around 9:00 AM, a bomb was suddenly thrown at the business department downstairs of the Shen Bao newspaper office on Hankou Road. It exploded at the time, resulting in the death of one person and injuries to eighteen others. The culprit, Wang Biaoqing (also known as A Biao, 33 years old), a Ningbo native, was apprehended and taken back to the police station. Under interrogation, Wang confessed to participating in the bombing and led Chinese and Western detectives to the scene of the incident to demonstrate. He also accompanied detectives from the French Concession police to search Wang's residence at 10 Yongfu Lane, Glock Road, in the French Concession. A badge of the "East Asia Anti-Communist League," numbered 1093, was found and confiscated, along with his concubine, Xu A'e, a Ningbo native. Both were taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police once escorted the male and female suspects to the First Special District Court, but due to some issue, they were not brought before the court and were instead taken back separately for continued investigation.

### Tongchang Customs Brokerage Accused of Embezzling Goods

Mao Zhiyue, the owner of Xie Xingxiang General Store in Sanguang Town, Northwest Chongming, came to Shanghai in April to purchase soda ash, Jiangping paper, other paper, and various colored foreign cloths. He entrusted Ni Rongshen, who runs Tongchang Customs Brokerage at 5 Xingye Lane, Tiantang Street, to handle customs clearance and ship the goods on the Zhejiang Maru to Narmen Port, Chongming for delivery. However, upon arrival in Chongming, one piece of miscellaneous cloth was missing. Mao immediately came to Shanghai to negotiate with Ni, but Ni kept delaying and refusing to resolve the matter. Therefore, Mao hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution against Ni Rongshen, the owner of Tongchang Customs Brokerage, in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for embezzlement of business goods, requesting that he be investigated according to the law and that the goods be recovered. This case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Sun Pengxian. The defendant, accompanied by his defense attorney Yu Enliang, appeared in court and claimed that he had not embezzled the goods and that he had reported and loaded all the goods for export at the time. He stated that after receiving the plaintiff's letter, he had already contacted the shipping company to investigate. He also presented evidence. The court verified the statements and ordered the defendant to post bail, rescheduling the hearing for 3:00 PM on the 29th.

### Doctor and Nurse in Love, Suddenly Attacked by Bandits; Doctor Fights Back, Injured in the Head; One Bandit Apprehended, Awaiting Investigation

Cao Minzhuo, a doctor from Hubei Province at the China Obstetrics Hospital at 149 Wuzhou Road, Hongkou, and his girlfriend, Chen Shangyi (21 years old, from Hangzhou, said to be a nurse at the hospital), went to Zhaofeng Garden on Jessfield Road in Western Shanghai for a walk on the afternoon of the other day. Until 10:00 PM, the two were still in the garden, sitting together in a secluded,

shaded spot, talking intimately. Unexpectedly, a jarring incident occurred. Two bandits, Zheng Suocai and Sun Jingen, were hiding a brick-made, black imitation pistol in Zhaofeng Park, intending to rob people. Seeing that there was no one else around Cao and Chen, they stepped forward. Zheng pulled out the fake pistol, threatening to make a scene, while Sun stood behind to watch. Just as they were about to search for valuables, Cao, with his sharp eyes, noticed that the pistol was fake. He resisted, but Cao was weak and

was struck on the head by the bandits. Chen, seeing this, was frightened and screamed loudly. A Chinese constable from the 271st Division arrived and apprehended Zheng Suocai. Sun escaped. Zheng and the fake pistol were taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Attorney Li Zhishan from the police station stated the above situation, stating that the case required investigation and requesting a postponement. Cao Minzhuo and Chen Shangyi also filed a complaint about everything. Judge Xiao ordered the case to be rescheduled for seven days for further review. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### A Pedestrian Shot on Rue Belliot, Western Shanghai

### Madam Chen Du Sues Her Husband's Brother for Assault

Chen Du, a woman from Jiading, wife of Chen Songquan (currently working at the Chung Hwa Book Company in Hong Kong), who resides at 3 Mitsubishi Lane, Kangji Lane, Rue Cardinal Foch, recently hired attorney Zhou Lianze to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. She is suing her husband's brother, Chen Shouqing (residing at 403 Fuzhou Road), and fellow townsmen Zhou Liuyi (residing at 105 Route Lafayette) and Xu Yongfu (residing at 379 Caishi Road) for gathering a crowd to assault and injure her, requesting that they be investigated according to the law. It is claimed that the plaintiff is the sister-in-law of the first defendant. The plaintiff and the first defendant jointly opened a printing shop, Chen Zhengtai, at 130 Kangji Lane, Rue Cardinal Foch, with a business office at 403 Fuzhou Road. Living expenses were paid by the first defendant. Recently, because the plaintiff's husband was far away in Hong Kong and her child was ill, she urgently needed money and asked the first defendant for assistance, but he insisted that she and her husband both agree before he would pay. The plaintiff, in desperation, argued with him and scolded him slightly. The first defendant held a grudge and, at around 10:00 AM on July 10, gathered over twenty male and female hoodlums along with the second and third defendants and broke into the plaintiff's residence. Under the direction of the first defendant, they violently beat the plaintiff, causing her injuries. After the neighbor, Chen Shaoshan, the fourth uncle, blew a whistle, the defendants scattered downstairs. The first defendant then raised a stick and struck her, and used broken glass to injure his own face, intending to harm the plaintiff. These circumstances were witnessed by Lu Caifeng and others. The police were called and brought the defendants to the police station, preventing further harm. The defendants' actions were arrogant and clearly violated Article 277 of the Criminal Code on assault. A request is made for a strict investigation according to the law. Upon receiving the complaint, the court heard the case yesterday by Judge Song Chuzhe. The plaintiff and her attorney appeared in court and recounted the previous events. When questioned, the defendants admitted to the assault without denying it. The court ordered the case to be rescheduled for further questioning on the 29th.

### Shaoxing Situation Unchanged, Relief Efforts Continue

According to news received by the Shaoxing Native Association, the situation in Shaoxing is still very peaceful. Although the Shaoxing Native Association has not received any telegrams from Shaoxing, the telegram exchanges and business activities of Shaoxing merchants in Shanghai with Shaoxing are normal. Several merchants have received private telegrams stating "Shaoxing is safe." As for the situation in Xiaoshan, because the central and northern districts of the area have fallen into Japanese hands, the remaining eastern, western, and southern districts have been affected to some extent, but the overall situation is still peaceful. Therefore, the Shaoshan Relief Society and the Shaoshan Grain Price Stabilization Committee, managed by the Shaoxing Native Association, are continuing their work as usual. The disaster relief society was formally established last week and is continuing to purchase rice and distribute porridge in areas such as Shunyang in central Zhejiang. However, the rice shortage in the Shaoxing area remains severe, with broken rice still priced at over 120 yuan per stone. The Shaoshan Grain Price Stabilization Committee has scheduled Shaoxing opera performances at the Carlton Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road on the evenings of August 1st and 2nd, with all proceeds from ticket sales going towards grain price stabilization donations. It will also hold a charity sale of calligraphy and paintings at the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road.

### Marital Knowledge: Dedicated to the Husbands of the Era; Love is Also a Struggle

In this era of intense competition, what is displayed everywhere is nothing but a state of struggle. What is humility and courtesy? These are nothing but the groans of the weak for self-consolation, and also beautiful terms used by the strong to suppress the weak. Look! Those who lack energy are being eliminated one by one, especially men who lack energy, it is even more difficult to find a wife! This is a recent fact: There is a certain gentleman who, hating his wife's promiscuity and adultery, repeatedly advised her to change but she would not, so he angrily killed her and was soon arrested. There is also a certain gentleman who, after several years of marriage, had a harmonious love life, but because his wife frequented dance halls and singing houses, attracting all sorts of admirers, she gradually began to regard her husband as worthless. Due to quarrels in bed, the husband suddenly had the idea of abandoning the world and drowned himself in the sea! As for other cases of separation, divorce, running away, suicide, catching adultery, and killing wives due to the wife's infidelity, they are too numerous to mention in today's society. Why does life fall into such a tragic state? Heavens! Isn't this humanity's heinous sin?

In fact, smart husbands of the era also have better ways to deal with promiscuous wives. Why do we study women's promiscuity? It must be because of dissatisfaction with their sex life; or they use sex as a tool to obtain living resources. Well, other men can give her satisfaction, so why can't her husband give her satisfaction? As for using sex as a tool, the husband should take responsibility for providing food and clothing. A hungry person thinks of food, a thirsty person thinks of drink, and when one is sexually hungry and thirsty, they will want to find private pleasure elsewhere. This is also a natural principle. If a husband is physically strong and full of energy, he can immediately bring his wife into a state of pleasure and make her realize the preciousness of her own husband. Even a promiscuous wife can be persuaded to eliminate evil thoughts and be completely loyal to her husband. Therefore, the best way to treat a promiscuous wife is to cultivate your own energy and be better than her lover in your sex life. Then she will surely dedicate her whole body and mind to you wholeheartedly. Perhaps this kind of wife will make you the happiest, otherwise, what else will she do?

However, if a man has committed masturbation, nocturnal emission, or early marriage and indulgence, or sought pleasure with prostitutes in his early years, and has damaged the reproductive glands that control his sexual health, then symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm and infertility, and neurasthenia are inevitable. Such husbands not only have unattractive appearances and premature aging, failing to arouse their wives' love, but also have fleeting sexual lives, or even complete impotence. How can a passionate wife not feel heartbroken and stage a tragedy between husband and wife? To seek a remedy, the disease must be cured from the root. According to famous doctors around the world and my experience, taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" is the most effective treatment. After taking this preparation, it produces sperm and nourishes the kidneys, strengthens the brain and invigorates the blood within a day and night. Taking it continuously in summer has an even more certain and rapid effect. If taken for a whole season, it can also promote development and nourish the nerves. Not only can the above-mentioned symptoms be completely cured, but it can also prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take the world-renowned holy medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Ximitos' Semen-Consolidating Tablets" (available in major Chinese and Western pharmacies such as Wu Zhou) to strengthen the seminal vesicle and prevent leakage of sperm for even faster results!

### Nocturnal Emission Must Be Cured Early

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

A smart person prevents problems before they happen, an ordinary person locks the stable door after the horse is stolen. If one repeatedly delays, knowing about the disease but failing to treat it, ultimately harming oneself and others, this is the most foolish thing in the world! Young people lack knowledge and have weak willpower. They may commit masturbation, lascivious thoughts, or same-sex love and other base behaviors due to momentary curiosity or being seduced. If they can recognize their mistakes and change, they can still be forgiven! However, most young people, once they enter this trap, linger and forget to return. This damages their sexual nerves and relaxes the seminal vesicle, and the terrible nocturnal emission becomes unavoidable.

As soon as one has nocturnal emission, those with a little reason will immediately realize it. At this early stage of nocturnal emission, treatment is easier to begin. At this time, if one takes the German old brand special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Ximitos' Semen-Consolidating Tablets", it can consolidate the seminal vesicle and calm the nerves, and will surely achieve the effect of the medicine curing the disease. However, most confused young people do not care about nocturnal emission even after suffering from it. Over the years, the symptoms of nocturnal emission worsen, turning into spermatorrhea. There are also those who suffer from brain weakness, memory loss, insomnia, palpitations, lower back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging due to sperm depletion and blood exhaustion. Such young people are bound to be pale and thin, exhausted, timid, and demoralized. Students will surely fail their grades and may be held back or drop out. Those engaged in agriculture, industry, or commerce also feel the difficulty of being competent and are in danger of losing their jobs. They are even more disliked by women in the realm of love, suffering unrequited love, heartbreak, and falling into a tragic state of life! If they are married, the marriage is in name only, with husband and wife sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. Not only is it difficult to harmonize the joy of marital relations, but there is also the possibility of infertility and no descendants. The future is bleak and full of suffering! However, in today's era of advanced medicine, there is still a remedy. In addition to continuing to actively take "Ximitos' Semen-Consolidating Tablets," one must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to fundamentally nourish the brain, kidneys, sperm, blood, and nerves. Continued use will surely cure all symptoms and improve health in a short period of time. If patients can come to our clinic for the latest treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a complete cure can be guaranteed.

Fitness

### Breasts are the Medium for Achieving Happiness

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Apart from the completely "rural" areas, modern men choose their spouses with the other person's "sound physique" as the first priority. As for what their face is like, what their knowledge is, and what their character is like, these are only secondary issues. From the standpoint of us medical experts, this view is considered very important. The entire cause of life, family happiness, and the strength of offspring are all directly and indirectly related to physical fitness. If a wife has a sound physique, then not only can she help her husband start a business and build a family, but in the private life between husband and wife, she has passionate and intense feelings that can make her husband happy and joyful, and his spirit will be infinitely comforted, the family will be full of joy, and she will give birth to clever children, and their happiness will be boundless!

But what kind of woman is considered to have a sound physique? Regarding this point, many people have not yet fully understood, but in the eyes of smart men, this is something that can be known at a glance. Whether a woman's physique is sound or not, it can be known simply by looking at their breasts and buttocks. If a woman's breasts are tall and elastic, and her buttocks are plump and round, then it can be determined that their reproductive gland ovaries are functioning properly. Their metabolism is vigorous, and their whole body is full of new cells, so their physique is naturally sound and free from disease. On the contrary, if the breasts are shriveled and the buttocks are thin, losing their beauty, this means that they are suffering from menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge, and malnutrition. Even if they have a face as beautiful as a flower or jade, they will be despised by the men of the era, and their fate will be very tragic! To seek a remedy, one can only rely on science. According to famous Chinese and Western doctors and our experience, it is universally recognized that taking the ingredients extracted from gonadal eggs, which are unusually precious, and preparing the non-nest preparation "Female Reproductive Hormone," is the most effective and targeted treatment. Because this preparation is very refined, it can nourish the ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, adjust menstruation, and eliminate all diseases of the uterus within a day and night after taking it. If continued to be taken, it will surely make the breasts tall and the buttocks plump, increase health and beauty, and obtain supreme happiness in a short period of time.

### Ironclad Facts

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

(1) Nocturnal Emission is Recovering

Patient Mr. Ding Xuewen, from Jiangdu, Northern Jiangsu, studied at a school in a certain province. Due to the war, the school moved to Shanghai to resume classes, and Mr. Ding also came to Shanghai with it. He was 19 years old and not yet fully developed. Because he had committed masturbation, his sexual nerves were weakened, and his seminal vesicle was relaxed, leading to nocturnal emission. He had it about two or three times a month. At first, because he did not know the harm, he did not treat it. Recently, the symptoms worsened, and he had nocturnal emission almost every week, causing dizziness, memory loss, and insomnia. He found studying very difficult. He also had lower back pain and was extremely tired after walking a little. He was almost bedridden (all of the above he said himself). Last month, he came to our clinic for treatment. After carefully examining his symptoms, I confirmed that they matched what he said. I instructed him to buy and take the holy medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Ximitos' Semen-Consolidating Tablets," and the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su," which is a tonic for the brain, kidneys, and nervous system, at the Chinese and Western Pharmacy. The Semen-Consolidating Tablets were used to strengthen his seminal vesicle and stop the emission, and "Sheng Zhi Su" was used to nourish the brain, kidneys, and nerves. He also received electrotherapy and injections to assist the effect. With these three methods used together, for a month now, all the diseases have suddenly disappeared, and his health has doubled.

(2) Brain Weakness and Kidney Deficiency Almost Ruined His Life

Mr. Chu Yushan, a local, is 26 years old and has been married for three years. Recently, he suddenly suffered from premature ejaculation, impotence, brain weakness, and insomnia. On a beautiful autumn night, there were constant sounds of frustration between the sheets. Mr. Chu is an accountant at a certain company and has also found it difficult to be competent. His future is bleak and full of sorrow! So, he came to me for treatment. I used a method that treats both the symptoms and the root cause. First, I instructed him to buy and take "Sheng Zhi Su" to nourish the kidneys, produce sperm, strengthen the brain, and invigorate the blood. Then, I gave him electrotherapy and injections. Now, just a month and a half later, he feels energetic, his love life is fulfilling, his cheeks are rosy, and he works tirelessly. He is completely different from before!

This buying was insufficient to cover the position, so before 11:00 AM, the spot US dollar rate tightened to 6.125 yuan. By the afternoon close, demand from short covering gradually decreased while selling pressure persisted, leading to a return to previous levels. There was still activity in the after-hours market, with more interest in buying US dollars, resulting in a slight softening of the US dollar rate by the evening close. The final rates were 3 shillings 9 0625 pence for British pounds and 6.15625 yuan for US dollars, tightening by 0.0625 and 0.03125 yuan respectively compared to the previous day's British and American rates.

### Speculation Goes Awry, Foolish Borrowing, Minor Fluctuations in the Gold Market

Yesterday's spot gold's unofficial market conditions remained stable, though the underlying trend after yesterday's close was quite weak. However, this had no impact today. Many holders felt fortunate and bought in at lower prices, so the price consistently hovered above 5,200 yuan. The opening price was 5,230 yuan. Later, there was a slight dip, but after forceful purchases by money exchange businesses and banks, the price rose to 5,270 yuan. Subsequently, due to reselling by securities firms and money exchange businesses, the price fell back to the 5,200 yuan level. The midday close was 5,210 yuan. The after-hours market started at 5,225 yuan, but banks leaned towards selling, and the price could not withstand a further drop of 20 yuan. Finally, with slight buying by securities firms and money exchange businesses, the market was able to maintain a closing price of 5,220 yuan. The market closed very early, which was due to a lack of discussion and trading. The result was a decline of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. There were more small transactions than large ones, with an estimated total volume of around 2,000 taels. Ornaments gold in gold shops did not move, and customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Declines by Another Twenty Yuan

Since this morning, each bar of spot gold initially experienced a slight decline compared to the previous day's closing price due to the slightly looser exchange market. Gold dealers first traded 20 taels at 5,230 yuan. Subsequently, due to selling by money exchange businesses, the price fell another 15 yuan, with money exchange businesses selling 10 taels to gold dealers at a loss of 5,215 yuan. Fortunately, a certain money exchange business aggressively bought at a low price, and at that time, gold dealers and silver shops also followed suit. The price soon rose by 55 yuan, with gold dealers trading 20 taels and the price increasing to 5,270 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain money exchange business suddenly took profits, and the market trend reversed downwards. Securities firms also turned to selling, and silver shops followed suit, resulting in a sharp drop of 70 yuan. Silver shops sold a total of 50 taels to gold dealers and others, retreating to 5,200 yuan. At noon, a certain money exchange business took advantage of the low price to buy again, leading to a rebound of 20 yuan. In the afternoon, a certain money exchange business first came to search for buys, immediately raising the price by 15 yuan. Money exchange businesses bought 10 taels from gold dealers at 5,225 yuan. Subsequently, silver shops mutually traded 10 taels at 5,205 yuan. Afterwards, money exchange businesses and a certain securities firm successively bought, gradually pushing the price up by 15 yuan. Securities firms bought several dozen taels from silver shops and others, reaching 5,220 yuan, which was the evening closing price. The result was a further decline of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The overall price range for the day was 70 yuan. The selling price of spot gold by cash shops was ten-odd yuan higher than the quoted price, while the buying price was thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold price was fifty-odd yuan lower than the listed gold price, with little trading activity.

Ornaments Gold Remains Unchanged All Day

The exchange price for ornaments gold per tael at silver shops did not change all day. Da Tong Heng remained at 540 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng's price was similar to the previous price, with a reduction of about 30 yuan for buying in.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Slightly

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the British and American gold pound decline before returning to previous levels. British gold notes were in slightly higher demand, and the market price rose slightly. American gold notes did not break out of the trading range, initially trading at 16.12 yuan, then gradually rising to 16.25 yuan. In the evening market, it retreated to 16.18 yuan, but it was still better than the previous day by 0.08 yuan. Hong Kong notes still had many buyers, and the market price rose slightly by 0.01 yuan. There were still many suppliers of Japanese gold notes, and the market price continued to fall by 0.008 yuan, with the evening market at 1.212 yuan. The underlying trend for Korean notes remained strong, and the evening market continued to rise to 1.03 yuan.

### Discount Rate Decreases by One Yuan

Yesterday's discount rate for exchanged bills decreased slightly. The discount rate was 48 yuan per thousand in the morning and around 50 yuan for selling. In the afternoon, it declined to 49 yuan and neared 47 yuan, down one yuan compared to the previous day. The call loan rate of the money industry association remained unchanged, with both the morning and afternoon markets quoted at 0.18 yuan.

### Securities Internal Bonds Frequently Fall

Yesterday's unofficial market for unified public bonds experienced a further decline due to negative news and increased anxiety among investors. The market sentiment weakened again, and the downward trend felt even stronger. Buying interest declined, and bears seemed to gain the upper hand, so the market price declined with little sign of recovery. Although the market opened weak in the morning, the decline was still slight because Jiu Feng, Xin Chang, and Lian Yi had all bought in. Afterward, the price fell steadily as Heng Fu, Tong Yu, De Fu, and Tong Kang tirelessly sold. The market was quieter in the afternoon, but the downward trend persisted because Liu Hao, Le Mao, No. 20, Tong Shun, and Hong Da successively sold. Fortunately, Jiu Feng, Tong Yu, Lian He, Lian Yi, and Xin Fu absorbed at low prices, so the market rallied slightly. The daily fluctuation resulted in a consistent decline of 0.25 to 0.50 yuan. Trading was still active, with a volume of over 1.3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed on the left.

The Industry Association reported that shares settled at the end of the week were easily absorbed. The underlying trend for various stocks at the close was firm and stable. If the news does not change, the market situation may turn stronger next week.

London, 18th (Thursday) Dispatch - Today's listed prices for Far East British company stocks saw HSBC Bank continue to rise. Stocks registered in England rose by £2, and stocks registered in Hong Kong rose by £1, with both priced at £68. The rest were unchanged.

London, 18th (Thursday) Dispatch - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable, with no changes in any bonds.

### Grain: Shantou Merchants Import Large Quantities of Road Rice; 10,000 Bags Arrive from Hong Kong; Prices Decline but Struggle to Recover

Yesterday, the foreign rice market experienced a shift from weakness to tightness. The earlier price declines were substantial, and recovery proved difficult. The market opened weak, with buyers hesitant and sellers eager to unload, causing a drop of 1.5 yuan across various grades of foreign rice. Activity then picked up, and prices rebounded accordingly. However, the market's prolonged weakness and fragile sentiment led to quick exhaustion after any upward movement. The closing statistics showed fluctuations, with prices still slightly lower than the previous day's closing. Grade One Chen Saigon rice was priced at 52 yuan and 51.5 yuan, Grade One Siam rice at 54.5 yuan and 54 yuan, "Fire-milled" rice at 54 yuan and 53.5 yuan, "Small-milled" rice at 52.2 yuan, Tokyo "Pointed" rice at 48 yuan, then down to 45.5 yuan, "Special" rice at 49 yuan, "Rough Pointed" rice at 43.2 yuan and 43 yuan, "Broken Pointed" rice at 41 yuan and 38.5 yuan, "Mi Lu" rice at 42-43 yuan, and "True Special" rice at 44 yuan. Road rice prices dropped by 2.3-2.4 yuan in the morning but recovered by about 1 yuan, ultimately settling slightly lower. Initially, weak and nervous firms sought to sell, followed by speculative hoarders and scattered sellers who reduced prices. Grade Two Saigon rice for June delivery and July arrival opened at only 58.5 yuan, with later higher bids failing to materialize. Grade Two Siam rice, loaded on June 20th, opened as low as 58.8 yuan, a sharp drop of 2.4 yuan from the previous close. Rice loaded on the 26th also opened at 58.8 yuan, down 2.2 yuan. Seizing this weakness, Shantou merchants aggressively bought up rice of both the 20th and 26th loadings. Rice loaded on the 20th rose from 59 yuan and 59.2-59.3 yuan to as high as 60 yuan, while rice loaded on the 26th rose from 59 yuan and 59.3-59.5 yuan to as high as 60.3 yuan, a rebound of 1.2 yuan and 1.5 yuan respectively, only 1.2 yuan and 0.7 yuan lower than the previous close. Total transactions reached 1,400-1,500 tons, mostly pulled in by Shantou merchants. However, it remains unclear whether they paid in cash and shipped the rice.

Foreign rice continues to arrive. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's "Hubei" vessel brought 10,002 bags from Hong Kong, arriving in Shanghai around 2 p.m. and docking at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. The supply of (native) japonica and glutinous rice remains limited, with only about 1,000 bags of japonica rice arriving. Rumors suggest that under-the-table transactions are balancing supply and demand, so prices haven't changed. Chang merchants are offering specially cleaned japonica rice at 66-67 yuan, genuine special japonica rice at 68 yuan, Su-Kun Changzhou white japonica rice ranging from a high of 65 yuan to around 60 yuan for stale rice, Qing-Si thin paddy rice from 65-66 yuan to 63-64 yuan, fresh South Port early rice at 62-63 yuan and stale rice at 60 yuan, fresh Hu-Jian rice at 59 yuan and stale rice at 57-58 yuan, Jin-Li special yuan rice at 62-63 yuan, Chang-Dan white yuan rice from 61.5 yuan to 60.02 yuan, and Hong Kong white yuan rice at 60 yuan and 59 yuan, etc.

### Flour and Wheat: Quiet

Wheat Flour: Yesterday's flour market was quite quiet. Since the Fuxin mill resumed operations, all mills have generally been able to supply flour. However, mill prices have reached 16 yuan, and foreign rice sells for 55 yuan per stone, so flour seems more expensive than rice, leading to a decline in actual sales. Furthermore, more and more flour shops are bundling sales with inland Japanese-made flour, making the market outlook even less promising. Overall, Chinese mills sold about 5,000 bags. Johnson flour also opened with 4-500 bags. The remaining miscellaneous inland brands and Phoenix brand, etc., are being held back.

Wheat: Yesterday's trading was also quiet. Arrivals in Hongkou were still somewhat active, but only small amounts were transported into the foreign concessions. Because transportation permits from Chinese mills have not yet been issued, purchase enthusiasm is low, and Japanese mills are also demanding high prices, resulting in limited new transactions and a dim market outlook.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Three Transactions for Broad Beans

Trade in miscellaneous grains is hampered by restrictions on both transportation and sales, preventing large-scale transactions. Only small-scale trading was seen in the market. Although there were three transactions for broad beans yesterday, the total volume was less than 600 bags. Sales were still limited to small quantities within the local market. A deal was struck for over 200 bags of Wujiang green-skinned broad beans at 22 yuan, over 280 bags of Beigang green-skinned broad beans at 20.07-20.04 yuan, and over 100 bags of Minhang green-skinned broad beans at 19 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Sluggish Sales; Sha City Weak

The yarn market is stagnant and lacks features. Market transactions are greatly reduced due to the narrow scope of speculation, leaving no targets for speculators and hindering activity. Actual sales are also sluggish. However, most operators maintain long positions and are unwilling to sell, creating a stalemate.

Morning prices for yarn opened weak, with foreign exchange rates stable but foreign cotton trending downward, dampening market sentiment. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn opened at 935 yuan, but after a slight dip, a few buyers made purchases, driving the price back up to 945 yuan. However, market transactions were thin, and the closing price was 940 yuan. Rumors circulated after closing, further weakening confidence. Statistics show that 1,050 bales were traded in half a day, and 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell by 4 yuan. The quantities purchased by various groups were as follows: 185 bales were shipped to Yantai and 70 bales to Hong Kong.

Local Traders: 780 bales   Hong Kong: 220 bales

Fuzhou: 40 bales        Inland: 10 bales

Total: 1,050 bales

### Cotton Market Lifeless

Current cotton trading remains inactive due to the downward trend in U.S. cotton and the unremarkable state of Indian cotton. The slow cotton yarn sales and unstable prices leave factories unenthusiastic, with only a few small transactions. The market lacks vitality.

Further News: Foreign cotton prices in the New York cotton market were very quiet yesterday. Later, sales by spot traders and the closing of some long positions resulted in closing prices falling by over 10 points compared to the previous day. The Indian market was calm, with no significant fluctuations including forecasts yesterday.

Although trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai was quieter yesterday, factories still made some purchases, injecting some life into the market. However, low inventory levels suggest there won't be a large price drop in the cotton market, so traders are generally firm in their positions.

### Sugar Market: Fluctuating Foreign Sugar Prices

The sugar market trended flat yesterday, with little fluctuation. The association's standard prices were: spot No. 24 raw white sugar, 67.5 yuan for goods stored at the local warehouse (unchanged), 67.2-67.15 yuan in the morning and 67.4 yuan in the afternoon for goods at other warehouses, 53-52.9 yuan for transshipment goods (down 1-2 yuan), Taikoo "Car White B" at the west warehouse 76.5 yuan (up 0.2 yuan), "HX" at 74.5 yuan, Dutch red sugar at 58 yuan, local factory snow white sugar at 67.5 yuan, No. 1 rock sugar at 88.5 yuan, and crystalline bright ice sugar at 90 yuan. It is reported that ordinary miscellaneous grades of domestic sugar saw slight movement, but prices remained unchanged.

### Dried Fruits and Nuts: Walnut and Walnut Meat Prices Rise

A new batch of walnuts recently arrived and is currently being priced, but prices have not yet been announced. Hand-picked walnuts rose by 5 yuan to 85 yuan, while ordinary Jinan walnuts remained at 60 yuan. Walnut meat also rose by 5 yuan to 190 yuan.

### Vermicelli Prices Continue to Fall

Vermicelli prices continue to decline due to quiet sales from various merchants. Longkou vermicelli fell by 7 yuan to 108 yuan, and Qingdao vermicelli fell by 5 yuan to 85 yuan. Soup vermicelli is experiencing low arrivals and slow sales with little fluctuation. An upturn is only expected with the arrival of cooler autumn weather.

### Sweet Almonds Plunge in Price

Sweet almonds are experiencing stagnant sales, with little trading in both high and mid-grade almonds. Northern Mountain almonds previously opened at 330-340 yuan. (Currency Exchange Price, formerly 380 yuan, now selling for 310 yuan, down 70 yuan).

### Coal: Indian Coal Piles Up, But Sales Remain Sluggish

Since large quantities of Indian Datta smoky coal arrived this week, the warehouses in Pudong are filled to capacity, a rare sight since the war. However, actual sales to factories in this area are sluggish, and merchant purchases are also hindered, causing prices to decline and soften further. One firm's internal price for unified coal warehouse receipts is 210 yuan, but there are few buyers. Block coal from local door-to-door dealers is 240 yuan per ton, delivered to customers, and profit margins have also narrowed.

### Miscellaneous: Cigarette Prices Remain Firm

Over the past few days, black market prices for cigarettes have remained strong. Although there were three sellers, market demand is strong, leading to tight supply. Holders of "British Brand" cigarettes are selling for a profit, with prices up 17 yuan from before. "Great British Brand" opened at 1,008 yuan, "Pin Hai Brand" at 680 yuan, new "Old Knife Brand" at 757 yuan, and old stock at 737 yuan (down 20 yuan). Local "Little Fairy" cigarettes are 480 yuan, and factory sales of "Five Flowers Brand" are limited, leading to tight market supply with prices at 530 yuan. Limited sales are insufficient to meet market demand. (Increased).

### Statistics: Price Changes in June - Hui

In June, Shanghai's prices, in theory, should have fallen due to increased foreign exchange supply. However, the facts show otherwise. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's report on the cost of living index for workers, the general index was 422.91, more than 40 points higher than last month, even with sharp foreign exchange declines (i.e., 382.91), reaching an all-time high. The main reason was the sharp rise in rice prices, which supported overall prices and prevented them from falling. This is evident in the categorized index, where the food category index rose sharply from 383.24 in May to 451.74. The miscellaneous category saw limited increases, while clothing and fuel both declined.

A total of 38 price increases from industrial and commercial firms were published in newspapers in June, a decrease of 96 from the previous month. Transportation had the most price increases, with 13 instances, ranking first. Food and beverage and electrical metal industries each had four increases, ranking second. Cultural, daily necessities, and decoration industries each had three increases, ranking third. Medical, civil engineering, packaging, and candle/foil industries each had two increases, ranking last. Analyzing the 38 price increases by commodity category, there were 24 types, with food and beverages and transportation goods each accounting for four types, ranking first. Daily necessities and electrical metal goods each accounted for three types, ranking second. Cultural, medical, packaging, and candle/foil goods each accounted for two types, ranking third. Civil engineering and decoration goods each accounted for one type, ranking last. Details are as follows:

(1) Cold Drinks: Ice blocks rose to 1.6 yuan each, ice-filled sweet cups sold for 0.5 yuan, large purple ice cream bars were 0.5 yuan each, "White Snow Princess" and "Taiji Consort" bars were 0.5 yuan each, small purple ice cream bars were 0.25 yuan each, and ice essence sticks were 0.1 yuan each (Hai Ning Foreign Firm).

Ancient Methods of Locust Control

The locusts that were left behind from the previous year hatch from their eggs in the spring and summer. When they come, their momentum is sudden and unstoppable. They fly and obscure the sky, almost darkening the sunlight. The places where they stop seem to be fixed, either passing through without stopping, or nesting in the fields without eating, or voraciously gnawing in the wild, almost destroying the seedlings. It is as if in the darkness, there is a force driving them. Farmers who encounter them are helpless and can only sigh at the edge of the fields, leaving it to natural disasters. However, local officials must take the people's affairs as their own concern and find ways to capture them. There are three main methods: First, when the locusts are newly born, dig them up and cut off their roots, so that they do not stir. Second, order the children and women of the people to search and capture them in the four villages and send them to the county for purchase at a price. Pour them to death on the spot, or burn them with firewood. The government donates funds to provide the price, so that the villagers will diligently capture them. As the villagers can obtain a small profit, they will all rise up to capture them, and the plague of locusts can also be suppressed. Third, when the locusts first arrive and have not yet gathered in the fields, quickly burn them with fire. Order all the servants and gather the garrison soldiers to search and capture them in the villages, and they must be completely exterminated before stopping. This does not rely on the people's power. However, although all three of these methods can eliminate the plague of locusts, when they fly and obscure the sky and gather in the four fields, it is impossible to capture them all. Subsequently, a thunderstorm or a strong wind may blow them away at once, or they may fly across the water and drown, so the autumn harvest may still be unaffected. This is also because Heaven does not cut off the people's food and then brings this about.

Short Talk

### Unrighteous Wealth

— Editor

Mr. Wenzi wrote to us, saying that a friend of his, Mr. Someone, works at a certain company and earns a meager salary. With the alarming rise in prices, he relies entirely on his past savings, the limited hard-earned money, to support the expenses of his family of several people. Now, a friend in a gambling organization is willing to find him a nominal position, with a monthly income that can maintain his family's livelihood and his children's education expenses. However, Mr. Someone "believes that this is unearned wealth, which he feels ashamed to receive, and is unrighteous wealth, which is even more detrimental to his conscience and damaging to his character." Therefore, he is a little hesitant; but on second thought, "Since he is not doing anything for them, and it is not too much to share a little in the unrighteous profits, not to mention that it can greatly help the lives of good people and the education expenses of the younger generation." Therefore, he is hesitant and wants us to express our opinion.

We believe that this world can be divided into two major camps, light and darkness, and the forces of these two camps are constantly fighting. People in the world must either participate in the work of light or participate in the work of darkness. There is absolutely no possibility of neutrality or sitting on the fence.

Since it comes from an unrighteous place, it is unrighteous wealth. Since it is unrighteous wealth, no matter where it is used or what fancy name is added to it, it is still unrighteous wealth. The place for educating children is not necessarily limited to schools; parents' every move is the most fundamental educational model. If you first inject the toxins of "unearned wealth" and "taking unrighteous wealth" into the minds of your children, and then ask them to receive school education, the result will be more harmful than beneficial to society; if your children "know", they would definitely rather drop out of school.

Mencius said it well, 'Life is what I desire, and righteousness is also what I desire; if I cannot have both, I will give up life and take righteousness!' Moreover, this is not a matter of life and death.

Medicine

### Malignant Tumor

— Cao Lingyou

When we talk about malignant tumors (Cancer), everyone may turn pale with fear. This is not surprising, because malignant tumors often lead to death, especially for those who are quite old, more die because of malignant tumors that cannot be cured! In today's scientifically advanced America, according to statistics, more than 150,000 people die from malignant tumors every year. Apart from death due to heart disease, malignant tumors can be said to be the number one killer.

Why do so many people die from malignant tumors? Is a malignant tumor an incurable disease? Malignant tumors are not like influenza and other diseases, which are caused by infection, nor are they caused by certain germs. The cause of malignant tumors can be said to be the continuous growth of toxic, disordered cells within the patient's own body! The most annoying thing about it is that early malignant tumors often do not show any special symptoms until the tumor has grown to a considerable extent in the patient's body and is discovered. At that time, it can be said to be too late. Not only is there no way to remove the tumor, but the tumor cells in the body will spread to other parts, and as a result, death finally comes.

If we usually pay attention to our bodies and go to the doctor immediately if any part of our body feels uncomfortable, and ask him to give you a full body check, it will not be difficult to find out if there is a malignant tumor in the body. If an early malignant tumor is found, with today's medical power, there is hope of a cure.

To date, doctors only have two methods for treating early malignant tumors: the first is to burn the tumor with radium or X-rays. The second is to perform surgery to cut out the tumor.

What methods should we use to prevent the growth of malignant tumors? In addition to cooperating with doctors and having regular health checkups, we must keep the body, face, skin, mouth, tongue, teeth, etc. clean, and avoid eating foods that make you feel uncomfortable. We must practice self-control, not drink excessive alcohol, not smoke too many cigarettes, and avoid prolonged constipation.

Malignant tumors can be said to be prevalent all year round and extremely fierce! The number of people who die from it every year cannot be counted. If you have reasonable prevention, then you can avoid repeating unnecessary deaths!

Essay

### Sleepless Night

— Xu Yi

Sir, have you ever suffered from insomnia on a hot summer night? That kind of experience unique to marginal people can only be understood by marginal people who have personally tasted the taste of insomnia.

In a cage-like cubicle, in the midst of a chorus of snores all around, under the control of a black devil's hand, while opening powerless eyes, experiencing the taste of insomnia, searching for the lost old dream, like the ancient fisherman groping for the old path to the Peach Blossom Spring.

And I am also very much like that fisherman, I was finally rejected outside the land of sleep, and leisurely, a unique "consideration" blocked my way.

I cannot remove this "consideration", nor do I want to discard this "consideration", so I have always been standing outside the frontier, I have always been awake; although I also know how comfortable and peaceful the land of sleep is.

Under the protection of the dark night, bedbugs boldly suck people's blood, people are gradually getting thinner, but the blood-sucking insects are rapidly becoming fat, and multiplying doubly, the whole room is full of guys who only know how to suck people's blood!

This terrible thing is only known to those who suffer from insomnia; and those who are trapped in the land of dreams, at most, only move a few times unconsciously.

Turn over, the surroundings are still full of ignorant snores; I open my eyes, I still open my eyes. Faced with this pitch-black sleepless night, I fall into bottomless sorrow.

Sir, have you ever suffered from insomnia on a hot summer night? That kind of experience unique to marginal people can only be understood by marginal people who have personally tasted the taste of insomnia.

Hawthorne's Case

### The Destination Behind the Dance

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Three: Conflicting Information

Hawthorne still asked in a self-absorbed manner, "Why did you go out alone for dinner yesterday?" Old Mao replied righteously, "There is naturally a reason for that. Last night I wanted to go to the theater, and dinner here is always around eight o'clock. The theater opens very early, so I naturally couldn't wait. So I went out around seven o'clock, had dinner at Zhengyu Restaurant first, and then went to the Tiansheng Stage. Last night, the Tiansheng Stage performed the full version of 'Iron Rooster,' and the scenery and mechanisms were very exciting. If you don't believe me, there is still a program in my room. I'll go get it." He turned around as if to leave.

Hawthorne stopped him and said, "Wait, don't go get it for now. I'm asking you, why were you in such a good mood last night that you went to the theater alone?"

Old Mao said, "It's not about whether I'm in a good mood or not. Miss Wang gave me a theater ticket, that's why I went to see it."

Hawthorne's eyes flashed again, as if he had inadvertently discovered another clue. He took two puffs of his cigarette, calmed himself down, and still maintained his composure, continuing to ask.

"Miss Wang gave you this ticket? Does she often give you tickets?" Old Mao said, "I can't say often, last night was the second time. Last Sunday night, she also gave me one." "Do you know where she got the tickets? Did someone give them to her?"

Old Mao frowned again, as if he was having difficulty answering. "I don't know for sure. But yesterday's ticket, it seemed—" "It seemed what?"

"It seemed like she bought it specifically. Because around three o'clock yesterday afternoon, someone rode a bicycle to deliver a letter. I took it in, and there was something hard in the envelope, like a theater ticket."

"Did he pay?"

"No. She has acquaintances in every theater, and she never has to pay immediately when she calls to buy tickets. Half an hour after the letter was delivered, Miss Wang came downstairs and gave me the ticket."

"What did she say to you then?"

Old Mao shook his head and said, "She didn't say anything. She just said, 'There's nothing to do at home tonight, go out for a walk.' Of course, I was very happy to accept." (50)

### New

— Yang Huashi

Let's bury all the old things, we are pursuing the new!

New is the most beautiful thing in the world, it is the life of the universe, it contains great, pure, and bright elements, it drives away all that is base, troubled, and dark.

People who move forward should all excavate in the new, it makes us walk on a wide and smooth road, it defeats the "enemy of success" for us.

There is a force in the torrent of the times that makes people love the new. Everything in the world is progressing, becoming newer day by day. Who can be satisfied with everything they have? Perfection is what people hope for. People will get sick if they don't breathe fresh air, and they will fall behind if they don't seek in the new.

Some people say: people's lives must be close to the "new" in order not to feel lonely and depressed, and to have perfect achievements.

Strive to walk on the new road, do not be infatuated with all the old things, living a decadent, comfortable, and anesthetized life, this is doomed to destruction. We are not afraid of difficulties, we work hard to improve, work hard to create, and strengthen our strength.

Friends, please remember, we must get new nourishment in order to enrich the value of life.

### Repentance of the City of Nineveh

Nineveh was the ancient capital of Assyria, holding a leading position in culture, commerce, politics, and economics. Unfortunately, it was full of sin, engaging in all kinds of filth, leading to its own destruction and offending the Lord. A sinner without God's salvation, his heart is like the city of Nineveh, filled with nothing but "evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, and slander...".

Nineveh's wickedness was overflowing, and God had only two options to deal with it. One was to uphold justice and punish the city according to its sins, destroying it. The other? To show mercy, not condemning past sins, and saving the city. God is love and could not bear the destruction of the city, so He sent the prophet Jonah to proclaim His way of salvation. Likewise, you who are not saved by God also have only two destinies: (1) destruction according to sin, (2) salvation through faith. But I do not want you to be unaware that although your sins are like scarlet crimson, God still loves you, and God wants to save you. He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, into the world precisely to save sinners.

When Nineveh heard the salvation proclaimed by Jonah, they believed in God, put on sackcloth and ashes, grieved for their sins, fasted, prayed, and asked God for forgiveness. They also turned away from evil deeds and abandoned violence, showing that they had truly repented. When God saw that they had truly repented, He forgave them and saved Nineveh. Christ Jesus is greater than Jonah. He not only proclaimed salvation but also died on the cross for our sins, rose from the dead after three days, ascended to heaven after forty days, and now still intercedes for you and me at the right hand of God. Do you want to escape the punishment of sin and receive God's salvation? Sincerely repent and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, and you will be saved. Today is the day for you to repent, because tomorrow is not yours; you do not know. Friends! Wake up!

### Li Qinian Departed from Hong Kong Yesterday, Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd

— Ling

The Chinese film industry lacks talent and urgently needs new blood, which is generally acknowledged. Therefore, in recent years, film companies have spared no effort in seeking new talent. Chen Yunshang, who rose to prominence with Xinhua, is shining brightly in the entire silver screen under this principle.

Recently, Li Qinian, who has been promoted by Yi Hua Company for a long time, is also a silver star famous in Hong Kong, just like Chen Yunshang. Although Li Qinian has not yet made a deep impression on the audience in Shanghai, they have all been impressed.

Several times the promotion to Shanghai, the results have always not been confirmed, but the reporter from reliable sources yesterday, obtained a reliable news, that Li Qinian has yesterday, took the Dutch mail ship Zhishani Jia departed from Hong Kong, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd.

As for the films that Li Qinian will star in, two have also been decided, one is a costume drama, and the other is a modern drama, but the film names are temporarily kept secret.

### Hu Rongrong Retires from the Film Circle

— Xing

At present, our country's film industry lacks child stars. Apart from Chen Juanjuan, Yan Fenghuang, and Hu Rongrong, there seems to be none. There is only Mou Ling, but Mou Ling has been out of the film circle for a long time.

Chen Juanjuan is now filming at Xinhua, Yan Fenghuang is working at Guohua, and only Hu Rongrong is still in turmoil. A while ago, both Guolian and Guohua companies had contacted Rongrong's father and brother, intending to invite her to film, but at that time, Rongrong's father and brother declined because she was not feeling well.

Yesterday, because of some small matter, the reporter went to Hu Rongrong's residence and met her father and brother, Hu Shaoyu and Hu Xinling. The reporter casually asked about Rongrong's filming plans, what were her plans?

"Because today's film industry tends towards the low-level themes of folk tales, we seem to feel very saddened by the film, and even more so, the phenomenon of open and secret struggles between film merchants is really an undesirable phenomenon, so we are not prepared to let Rongrong continue her filming..." These were Mr. Shaoyu's words.

"...For movie fans, it is considered a very honorable thing to make movies, but for those who have lived under the mercury lamps, it feels as indifferent as doing other things. Therefore, my father and I once discussed that we will never let Rongrong live the silver screen life again," said Hu Xin.

"So does Rongrong herself like to make movies?"

"Actually, the child is indifferent. She doesn't understand whether making movies is good or bad at all. From our observation, she doesn't seem to have a strong interest in movies."

In this way, Rongrong is sure not to be active on the screen again.
