Editorial

### Price Stabilization and Group Rice Purchasing

Since the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession municipal authorities jointly issued a notice on the tenth of last month, strictly warning against rice price gouging, the price of rice in the Shanghai concessions has suddenly stabilized. The price of rice at one point almost reached 50 yuan, and speculators claimed that it would reach 70 or 80 yuan. Now, exactly one month later, it has remained around the 40 yuan mark. This effective administrative measure is gratifying, but the so-called food problem has not been fundamentally solved.

The problem is vast and difficult to solve. The root of the problem lies in the improvement of the overall environment of the concessions, which can only be observed gradually as the world changes. Currently, those concerned about the food issue are focusing on two things: price stabilization and group rice purchasing. The price stabilization method has been determined, with members designated by the rice industry, 50 each to be responsible for selling coupons and selling rice, starting from the 18th of this month, each selling up to 50 bags per day. The price is one yuan of legal tender for six and a half catties of Saigon broken rice, with a limit of one yuan per person. The group rice purchasing method has been determined, with funds raised to purchase rice from overseas and store it in warehouses. If the price of rice is stable, the stored rice will be maintained; if the price is high, it will be distributed to designated households at the purchase price, and the rice funds will be used to purchase more rice and store it in warehouses. This process of buying and selling will continue until the situation returns to normal. Price stabilization is essentially charity, while group rice purchasing is essentially consumer cooperation. Both have their own significance. The residents of the isolated island have long felt like orphans. Now, they are making such painstaking efforts and cautiously managing the food issue. This is a manifestation of the vitality and instinct of the Chinese nation, and it is commendable.

I have estimated that the total amount of rice sold for price stabilization is 2,500 bags per day. If each person eats one catty per day, then each day of price stabilization benefits 560,000 people, which is a significant number. Price stabilization benefits for one day benefit for one day; price stabilization for ten days benefits for ten days. It is still difficult to foresee how long this round of price stabilization will last. However, the longer the price stabilization lasts, the more impoverished people will benefit. This is a great service to the public. Furthermore, according to newspaper reports, funds are being raised for price stabilization, with a target of one million yuan. Raising one million yuan is not easy. If only one million Shanghai residents are relying on price stabilization, then each person will only receive one yuan in benefits. Given the difficulty of obtaining this one yuan, we can understand the seriousness of the problem. If we do not pool our efforts, how can we succeed? I must appeal to all sectors to generously donate to this great undertaking. It should be understood that the rice industry is responsible for managing the matter, but it is not solely the rice industry's responsibility. Since the rice industry has already contributed, all industries should contribute more money. Social tranquility is the welfare of the public.

As for group rice purchasing, it is intended for those who have the ability to support themselves, who do not need charity and are not subject to manipulation. When rice prices are stable, they are normal customers of the rice industry. When rice prices soar, they rely on consumer cooperation to survive. Moreover, it is not just about survival. When rice prices rise sharply, the rice industry suffers from the difficulty of meeting demand and is responsible for the safety of transportation and sales. Ordinary cooperation necessarily divides commercial profits, while emergency cooperation only curbs speculation. This has several benefits and no harm. China has advocated cooperation for twenty years, with theoretical instruction and factual attempts. The success or failure has varied, and the effectiveness has not been significant. The reason for this may be that the understanding is not thorough, the implementation is not strong, or the need for cooperation in life is not pressing. Now, using rice as a connection and using group rice purchasing to leverage the function of cooperation, I am not only optimistic about its success in theory. However, it also cannot be like general cooperation matters in everything, and we must wait for various supplementary measures to seek its change and pass: that is, those who have the ability to support themselves may not be able to contribute to the fund; residents within the border who enjoy the benefits of group rice purchasing may not all have the opportunity to participate; it is hoped that various public groups and financial institutions will have a greater spirit and support it from the center, and plan it as a whole; It is also hoped that all industries, regardless of the size of their scale, their managers must take into account the necessary needs of employees and their families, prepare in advance, and make arrangements on their behalf, so that on the day of rice prices, they can obtain a way to relieve hunger together. Contributing to the rice purchase fund is very different from donation; even if unavoidable losses are inevitable, the losses must be small and the overall situation is large. Price limits are an administrative measure, although it has been effective, but it is not enough to speak of a palliative method in the food problem; If we rely on the current price limit and think that the food problem is no longer a problem, even the concession authorities have not thought of it.

### Japanese Army Minister Hata Shunroku Demands Prime Minister Abe Resign, Military Straightforwardly Expresses Distrust, Saying Current Cabinet Should No Longer Extend Its Life

Tokyo, After the news that Army Minister Hata Shunroku had requested Prime Minister Abe's resignation, the Japanese political situation became increasingly tense. The Kokumin Shimbun reported that after Hata Shunroku met with major military leaders at the end of the week, he frankly explained to the Prime Minister yesterday the Army's decision not to use the resolution of the China Incident as an excuse to extend the cabinet's life. The Army Minister urged the Prime Minister to step down, as the entire country strongly opposed him. The Prime Minister did not commit at the time, but if the Prime Minister did not accept this advice, the Army Minister would likely express his opinion more frankly. The Prime Minister is still disregarding the increasingly fierce opposition of the majority of members of the Lower House and expressing his determination to deal with the situation with the country. This fact is increasingly opposed by all parties. Even high-ranking politicians do not approve of the Prime Minister. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo, Japanese politicians were actively meeting throughout the day today. In the morning, the cabinet held a meeting to discuss the political crisis in a roundabout way. After the meeting, Prime Minister Abe met with Army Minister Hata Shunroku for half an hour. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Army Minister now holds the key to the situation, namely whether or not the Army Minister will express the "general wishes of the Army" to the Prime Minister and when he will do so. At the same time, the Prime Minister is clearly planning to continue to deal with the situation. This afternoon, Abe entered the palace to meet with the Emperor, reporting on domestic and administrative matters. He then discussed the political situation with the most important figures in the cabinet for an hour. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo, According to well-informed political circles, the Japanese Abe cabinet is likely to fall in the next few days, mostly due to domestic issues such as the food problem and bureaucratic policies. The succeeding cabinet will likely include more figures from political parties to seek coordination between the political parties and the military. (9th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo, Prime Minister Abe visited the Japanese Emperor at 1:00 p.m. today to report on the basic policy of the Japanese government regarding the new government in China, which was decided at the extraordinary cabinet meeting on the 8th. (9th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

Tokyo, After Army Minister Hata conveyed the overall opinion of the Army to Prime Minister Abe on the 8th, the Prime Minister continued to hold important talks with the Army Minister today. After questioning the Army Minister's true intentions regarding the contents of yesterday's statement, the Prime Minister revealed his own feelings and frankly exchanged opinions with the Army Minister. In view of the surrounding situation, especially the movements of the military, the Prime Minister believes that it is necessary to determine his attitude. He plans to meet with Party leader Sano in the next few days to subtly inquire about the atmosphere of the political parties before making a final decision. (9th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

Tokyo, After Army Minister Hata met with Generals Terauchi and Sugiyama on the 8th to exchange important views on the political situation, he met with Prime Minister Abe to express the military's views on the political situation and requested that they be considered with caution. Prime Minister Abe did not clearly express his opinion at the time, but after the extraordinary cabinet meeting, he asked cabinet members Nagai, Kohara, and Akita to stay behind to discuss countermeasures. As a result, it was decided that Prime Minister Abe himself or Secretary-General Endo would meet with Army Minister Hata on the 9th to express the government's views. As a result, the political situation on that day became increasingly serious, and the development of the situation is extremely noteworthy. (9th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

### Hu Shih Speaks in US, Urges Sanctions Against Japan, Implementation of Embargo on Military Supplies, Accelerating Destruction of Forces Invading China

New York, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih, speaking at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, suggested that democratic and peace-loving people of all countries boycott Japan to accelerate the destruction of Japanese military forces invading China. He called for the implementation of an effective embargo on the export of military supplies and raw materials to Japan. Although Dr. Hu did not specifically mention the United States on this issue, he had previously said that the economic and naval power of the United States was sufficient to stabilize the Pacific and cited the US-Japan Commercial Treaty of 1911, which expires on January 26, as an example. He solemnly declared that the Chinese people are determined to fight Japan until the Japanese economy is exhausted and the military is deeply mired in the mud, and they have no choice but to accept lasting peace.

### Rumored Japanese Negotiations with Wang, Contents of So-Called "Peace Treaty"

Tokyo, Authoritative sources here today claimed that the "New Central Government" planned to be established by Wang Jingwei with Japanese support had negotiated a "peace" treaty with Japan, the contents of which included ceding "Manchukuo" to Japan and allowing Japan to station troops indefinitely in North China and Inner Mongolia. The "peace treaty" also stipulates that the "Wang regime" sign an anti-communist alliance with Japan and "Manchukuo" and agree to Sino-Japanese investment in developing China's financial resources. The treaty stipulates that Japan withdraw Japanese troops from Central and Southern China within two years and nationalize China's railways. Well-informed sources claimed that the issue of Japanese troop withdrawal from Central and Southern China was an obstacle in the recent negotiations between Wang and the Japanese side. Finally, Japan agreed to withdraw its troops, and the negotiating obstacle was eliminated. Observers indicated that Wang's signing of an anti-communist alliance with the Japanese, if the National Government continues to resist Japanese aggression, will give the Japanese troops a legitimate reason to stay in Central and Southern China for more than two years. Japan often refers to the National Government as a "communist government." Under the anti-communist treaty, Wang Jingwei has agreed to the indefinite stationing of Japanese troops in North China and Inner Mongolia. The peace plan outlined by authoritative sources includes the following: (1) Wang Jingwei recognizes "Manchukuo." (2) Wang Jingwei signs an anti-communist alliance with Japan and "Manchukuo." (3) Japanese troops may be stationed in North China and Inner Mongolia under the anti-communist defense treaty. (4) Sino-Japanese joint investment in developing China's financial resources. (5) Japan guarantees that after Wang Jingwei signs a "peace" treaty with Japan, Japan will withdraw its troops from Central and Southern China within two years. (6) China's railways are nationalized. Observers pointed out that Wang's insistence on the nationalization of the railways is Wang's attempt to use the railways as his main political weapon to continue political warfare with the National Government. The fact that the Japanese side is willing to negotiate peace with Wang under the above conditions has shown that Japan has made considerable concessions on the conditions previously proposed, especially on the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins and the nationalization of railways. It is said that Wang prevented the mouth from proposing that the Japanese side should be allowed to establish spheres of influence in the Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing areas. Wang refused to grant the Japanese side political privileges, but it is generally believed here that Wang will give the Japanese side special rights in the area. The above procedure, agreed upon by Wang and the Japanese side in Nanjing on December 20 last year, will be followed by a meeting between Wang and the leaders of the "Beiping Provisional Government" and the "Nanjing Reformed Government" on January 15, before the establishment of the "New Central Government" under the banner of the "Kuomintang." Formal "peace" negotiations with the Japanese side will then begin. (9th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo, The Japan Times commented this morning on the fact that the Abe cabinet approved the understanding with Wang Jingwei regarding the future organization of the new government in China, saying that although the matter is extremely important and a turning point in the China Incident, it is only a step towards the resolution of the East Asian situation. Undoubtedly, this will become a new standard for measuring and adjusting the relations between Japan and other countries in China. What is particularly important is that the foundation of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation must be fixed before the establishment of the new regime. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

### Foreigners in Beiping Concerned About US-Japan Relations

Beiping, Foreigners from all walks of life here are concerned about the trend of events if the United States refuses to sign a new commercial treaty with Japan when the US-Japan Commercial Treaty of 1911 expires on the 26th of this month. They are not very disbelieving in the possibility that anti-American posters have already been printed and that an anti-American movement has begun. On the contrary, the anti-British movement has indeed disappeared. Today, the British do not encounter any inconvenience, and there are rarely any reports of anti-British movements in this city. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing, The Central Daily News published an article today, emphatically stating the importance of "economic pressure" from the United States and Britain. According to the figures for Japan's import and export trade in 1938, Japan's exports to the United States accounted for 17.3% of total exports, and imports from the United States accounted for 35.7% of total imports. In the same year, Japan's exports to Britain accounted for 23.2% of total exports, and imports from Britain accounted for 22.8% of total imports. It is not difficult to understand why Japan is so eager to maintain normal trade relations with the United States and Britain. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

Before the misfortune, Dr. Bethune planned to leave China and travel to the United States to give lectures and raise medical funds for the Chinese army in Shanxi Province. Dr. Bethune had previously served in the Canadian Volunteer Medical Corps during World War I and the Spanish Civil War. Not long after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Dr. Bethune came to China to serve in the Chinese army, performing an average of 130 surgeries per month, sometimes 10 to 15 surgeries in a single day. From April to July 1939, he performed a total of 315 surgeries, walked 500 miles, established 13 wound treatment centers, 2 medical teams, and gave numerous technical lectures. He also established a model hospital. His unfortunate death is deeply mourned by all who hear of it. (Reuters, 9th dispatch)

### Result of Venice Talks: Rumor of Italy and Hungary Concluding Military Alliance; Intended to Maintain Peace in Southeastern Europe; Italy Determined to Prevent War from Spreading South

Budapest. According to reliable sources last night, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano concluded a defensive military alliance treaty between the two countries during their talks in Venice last weekend. The purpose of this alliance is said to be to "protect and maintain peace in the Balkans and Southeastern Europe." It will be formally announced after Csáky reports the matter to the Cabinet. (United Press, 9th dispatch)

Rome. After returning here yesterday from Venice, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano immediately went to the Palazzo Venezia to meet with Mussolini and report on everything. Ciano and Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky concluded a defensive military alliance treaty between Italy and Hungary during their meeting in Venice. (United Press, 9th dispatch)

Rome. The Italian semi-official newspaper "Italian Daily" today published an article by Gaeta, stating that Italy is determined to prevent the war from spreading south to the Balkans and the Mediterranean. Everyone should know that Hungary now stands on Italy's side, supporting the policies currently being planned by Italy and the methods Italy intends to adopt to achieve their progress. At the same time, Italy also stands on Hungary's side regarding special diplomatic difficulties. Therefore, Romania should consider the suitability of resolving the land dispute between Hungary and Romania in light of the European situation. If this issue is not resolved, it will be a great mistake. A New York wireless broadcast stated that according to reliable sources in Budapest, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Danish Foreign Minister Csáky met in Venice at the end of last week and agreed that Italy and Hungary would conclude a military defense alliance treaty. If Hungary is invaded by the Soviet Union or Germany, Italy will take the field to support Hungary. Csáky will discuss this with the Hungarian government and then go to Italy again. However, people in Rome have not heard of the news reported by New York radio. (Reuters, 9th dispatch)

London. Regarding rumors that Italy has signed an alliance treaty with Hungary, targeting Germany and the Soviet Union, diplomatic circles here generally say that this is unfounded. Even if Hungary and Hungary conclude an alliance to defend against the Soviet Union, it would not be directed against Germany, because Italy is determined not to publicly take an anti-German stance. As for Italy's hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union, it has recently softened slightly. There are two reasons for this: first, it is unwilling to cause displeasure to Germany; second, the Soviet Union is at war with Finland and has no time to care about the Balkan Peninsula. (Havas, 8th dispatch)

Venice. On the last day of Hungarian Foreign Minister Száky's visit to Venice, he took a plane specially prepared by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to Lake Garda for sightseeing. Foreign Minister Száky then returned to Budapest by express train at 6 p.m. yesterday. Italian authorities specially sent representatives to the station to see him off. (Haitong, 9th dispatch)

Italian Experts to Assist in Reorganizing the Hungarian Army

Paris. After the foreign ministers of Italy and Hungary held talks in the Port of Venice, diplomatic circles here commented that the Italian government intends to conduct separate negotiations with various countries in Southeast Europe, and the Venice talks were just the prelude. In general, Ciano and Csáky agreed on the necessity of curbing the spread of Bolshevism in Southeast Europe, but Hungary's maintenance of this policy has its necessary conditions, that is, Italy can come forward to help in times of crisis. It is heard that the Hungarian army is being reorganized with the assistance of Italian experts. One point that must be paid attention to is that if Italy wants to send troops to aid Hungary, it must pass through Yugoslavia, and it must obtain the country's consent before it can. Considering the current friendship between Italy and Yugoslavia, and between Yugoslavia and Hungary, this is likely. Some people even believe that there has been some contact between Italy and Yugoslavia, and the Hungarian authorities often conduct talks with Yugoslavia within the shortest period of time. In short, the content of the "Venice Policy" agreed upon by the diplomatic authorities of Italy and Hungary is not to organize a Balkan group, but to take various appropriate measures to ensure that the existing disputes between the countries in the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River basin are not used by other countries. That's all. Therefore, Italy should strive to ease the tense situation in Southeastern Europe, and will certainly conduct further negotiations with Romania in the future, so as to propose some solutions to the problem of Outer Transylvania (formerly owned by Hungary before the last European War) and Dobruja (formerly owned by Bulgaria before the last European War), so that Romania can dispel suspicions and reconcile with Hungary and Bulgaria. People generally believe that it is not difficult for Romania and Hungary to establish a kind of "temporary method", so as to make the general situation in the Balkan Peninsula tend to ease. (Havas, 8th dispatch)

The Status of Danube Countries is Increasingly Important

Rome. Regarding the Venice talks between the foreign ministers of Italy and Hungary, the Roman evening newspaper "Sernarel Bao" commented that the reaction to the talks between the foreign ministers of Italy and Hungary is enough to show the important position of the Danube countries in international politics. Since the dramatic changes in the European situation in September 1939, the responsible persons of the Danube countries should seize the opportunity to carefully review the entire situation of the Danube countries. The currently popular realistic spirit will definitely produce valuable results for maintaining the security and peace of the Danube countries. If Italy launches this proposal, it will definitely get the necessary understanding and create a new situation for the Balkans and Europe. The sincerity and friendly spirit of the Danube countries should be seen in the facts. (Haitong, 9th dispatch)

German Newspaper Says Italy is Wary of Britain and France

Berlin. The German Diplomatic and Political Review published a long article today commenting on the recent negotiations between the Hungarian and Italian foreign ministers in Venice. It is said that although Britain and France have repeatedly tried to expand the scope of the battlefield, fortunately, the determination to resist this trend is gradually increasing on the other side. The motive of the Venice meeting is due to this. Since the outbreak of the European War, Italy has repeatedly tried to prevent the countries of Southeastern Europe from being dragged into the war and to prevent the disruption of the economic construction work of those countries. Everyone knows that Britain's forced acceptance of its guarantee by Greece and Romania, and the mutual assistance agreement signed by Britain and France with Turkey, can cause the war to spread to the Balkans, which will naturally affect all the countries involved and harbor suspicion. Italy is especially suspicious of Britain and France's organization of groups and their attempts to lure the countries of Southeastern Europe into their clutches. The newspaper concluded that Britain and France's interest in Southeastern Europe is nothing more than studying whether or not it is appropriate to expand the area into a battlefield, while Germany, Italy, and Hungary all agree that Southeastern Europe must continue its peaceful work and natural trade.

Yugoslav Vice Premier to Visit Hungary

Milan. According to the "Serbia Bao", Yugoslav Vice Premier Maček will visit Hungary in the near future.

Budapest. Foreign Minister Csáky returned to this place from Italy this morning and immediately issued a statement to the press, saying that he was very pleased to be warmly received by the government of that country during this trip. "We have been working for peace for twenty years now, and this aspiration has not wavered. I believe that our patience will eventually be rewarded one day." (Havas, 9th dispatch)

Rome. After Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky returned home, he sent a telegram to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, saying, "I am very grateful for your close and deep friendship during my visit to your country a few days ago. It is gratifying that our two countries have the same opinion on painstakingly maintaining peace in the Danube River basin." (Havas, 9th dispatch)

### Britain, France, and Turkey Sign Economic Agreement

Paris. Turkish Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Manenxioglu, recently signed several economic and financial agreements between the three countries with representatives of Britain and France at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The goal is to develop mutual trade and expand economic cooperation, but the detailed terms have not been announced. (Havas, 8th dispatch)

### United States Uncovers Major Conspiracy - A Certain Revolutionary Group Planned to Bomb Western Dams

Washington. The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently uncovered a major conspiracy. The instigators are said to be a foreign revolutionary group. The purpose was to blow up the giant dams built by hydroelectric power plants in the western United States, hoping that after the plant stopped supplying electricity, aircraft manufacturing plants in California would not be able to continue working. Fortunately, the discovery was made early and these people were unable to fulfill their wishes. (Havas, 8th dispatch)

### British Authorities Unwilling to Announce Reasons for Change of Secretary of War - Plan to Explain to Leaders of Opposition Parties - Belisha Handled Transfer of Duties Yesterday

London. Regarding the resignation of Secretary of War Belisha, political figures here recently said that this matter should not have any serious impact on the current cabinet, because all sectors hope that the government will explain this matter not because they think the matter is particularly serious, but only to dispel the doubts raised by people at home and abroad. Moreover, Belisha's departure was not caused by military issues. In other words, it did not arise from the number of British Expeditionary Force personnel, nor did it originate from the possibility of British troops fighting elsewhere. On these issues, all parties agree and there are no disputes. However, the National Executive Committee of the Labor Movement is scheduled to meet on the 10th of this month to discuss this matter, and some people may take the opportunity to use this as an excuse to attack the government. However, public opinion generally opposes using this matter as a tool for party strife. As for the reasons for Secretary of War Belisha's resignation, if it is for the benefit of the country and should not be made public, then the opposition parties may ask the Prime Minister to convene a closed-door meeting of the House of Commons to make an explanation. However, the government is generally expected to believe that this is not necessary. In any case, before the House of Commons meets, the government authorities will hold talks with the leaders of the opposition Labor Party to exchange views and inform them of confidential information. Therefore, the unrest caused by this change of Secretary of War is expected to be completely quelled within ten days, and it will definitely not have any impact on the current cabinet. It is also rumored that Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to add a Ministry of National Defense, with Churchill, the Secretary of the Navy, as the Minister, and all three services of the Navy, Army, and Air Force will be placed under his control. Diplomatic circles do not believe in this statement. (Havas, 8th dispatch)

London. After resigning as Secretary of War, Belisha went to the War Office this morning to handle the handover, and this afternoon he will enter the palace to meet King George VI and present the seals of office. (Havas, 9th dispatch)

### British Home Secretary Warns the People Not to Believe Peace Propaganda

London. Home Secretary Anderson recently gave a speech in Singbaugh City, saying, "After a series of shocking events have occurred in a country, some people therefore say that the war has no meaning. This kind of emotion is spreading widely, but I want to warn the people of the country not to be misled by this kind of peace propaganda. The government authorities have made the greatest determination to ensure that the international situation is no longer manipulated by powerful forces, and the people of the whole country have repeatedly expressed their support for the government. At this time, peace may be beneficial to the enemy. It is important to know that this kind of peace only delays the war for a while. Once the enemy replenishes its war machinery, it will inevitably launch another war. There is no doubt about it. In short, the major issue at the moment is whether we are willing to establish the rule of law or whether we are willing to be ruled by powerful forces. Between the two, we must decide which way to go at this moment." (Havas, 9th dispatch)

### Chamberlain Devotes All His Efforts to Close Cooperation with France - Speaks at London City Hall

London. Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech at City Hall today that in peacetime, the burden on the person in charge is enough to break some of his predecessors. In wartime, the burden is even heavier. He originally hoped that he would be able to avert the scourge of war during his term of office. Since the day war was declared, his thoughts and actions have been focused on one thing, that is, to do everything in his power and use the brave methods of France, an allied country, to cooperate extremely closely. The Prime Minister continued that he originally intended this year's New Year to be a tragic day in world history, but fortunately it has passed quietly. But this is the tranquility before the great storm. Now only at sea can it be said that the war is in full swing. The war trend in the first four months of the war can only be most clearly identified at sea. His words were greeted with applause. City Hall will hold many meetings now, and many cabinet members will attend and speak. (Reuters, 9th dispatch)

### Disagreement Between British and Irish Governments - Bombing Incident Occurs in Londonderry

Amsterdam. This morning, I heard that there was a serious conflict between the British government and the Irish government. The reason for the conflict is that there are no less than 40,000 Irish people working in Britain now, between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-eight. Among them, many have the idea of going home, but the British government believes that they have lived in England for more than two years and have the obligation to serve in the military, so they are not allowed to leave England. Irish Free State Prime Minister de Valera was not happy about this and protested to the British government, saying that "regardless of how many years the citizens of the Irish Free State have lived in Britain, they still maintain their Irish nationality." Regarding this point, the British authorities have not yet indicated that they will concede. (Haitong, 9th dispatch)

London. A bombing incident once occurred near the fire brigade in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.

### Tense Situation on the Dutch-German Border - Germany Establishes Army Headquarters on the Dutch Border - Rumor that Serious Threats Will Be Re-imposed on the Netherlands Within Two or Three Weeks

London. The Daily Telegraph's Amsterdam correspondent cabled that he had received reliable news from western Germany that Germany had established a new army headquarters about 40 miles from the nearest point on the Dutch border. The news was accompanied by a warning that within two or three weeks, Germany would impose a threat on the Netherlands that was as serious as, or more so than, in November of last year. Heavy artillery positions have already been deployed near the Dutch border, with particular emphasis on the narrow strip of German territory extending into the Dutch Cleves region. It is heard that the caliber of the guns in this artillery corps is strong enough to bombard Utrecht (located in the western part of the Netherlands, on a tributary of the Rhine River, a commercial center and an important area for national defense). In the past few weeks, many new army airfields have been built along the Dutch border, from Emden to Aachen. The correspondent did not say that this news must be viewed with extreme seriousness. The warning that the Dutch government issued to Germany last Saturday and Sunday was probably for this reason. (Reuters, 9th dispatch)

London. According to the Daily Telegraph's Amsterdam dispatch, Germany has recently established a German military headquarters on the Belgian-Dutch border, located in the direction of Racklinhausen. German heavy artillery units have all been moved to the Cleves area in southern Netherlands, making it convenient to bombard Utrecht in the Netherlands. (United Press, 9th dispatch)

### Churchill Meets British and French Generals

Amsterdam. British Secretary of the Navy Churchill and General Ironside are currently in France. Yesterday, they met with British Expeditionary Force Commander-in-Chief Lord Gort, General Gamelin, and other senior generals to discuss military issues. Political figures believe that Churchill and Ironside's visit to France is related to the resignation of Secretary of War Belisha and the issue of the Royal Air Force sent by Britain to France being commanded by the Expeditionary Force authorities. It is said that Churchill's visit to France coincided with Secretary of War Belisha's submission of his resignation, so his position is even more consolidated. (Haitong News Agency, 9th dispatch)

### Soviet Army Continues Offensive, Shelling Finnish Positions, Finnish War Report Claims Major Victory on Eastern Front, Soviet Rear Threatened

Helsinki – Soviet troops in the Karelian Isthmus and north of Lake Ladoga today launched another fierce artillery bombardment on Finnish positions, followed by short-term assaults, but without achieving any success other than increasing casualties. On the other hand, Finnish troops have penetrated deep into the Soviet lines, engaging in the destruction of communication lines. The long route from Leningrad to Murmansk is under threat from Finnish forces. (United Press, 9th)

Helsinki – A Finnish communiqué stated that Finnish forces have recently achieved a significant victory along the road from Suomussalmi to the Soviet border, destroying a Soviet division. In addition to capturing a thousand Soviet soldiers, they also seized a large number of war materials, including tanks and armored vehicles. The Finnish army's main objective in the recent battles was to repel the Soviet 44th Division, and this objective has now been achieved. The main force of the Soviet army has been destroyed. The Finnish spoils of war include 102 artillery pieces, 43 tanks, 10 armored vehicles, 20 trailers, 278 various motor vehicles, over a thousand horses, and 47 field stoves. A large amount of the war equipment used by the 44th Soviet Division was taken from the 163rd Soviet Division, which was defeated on the same line a week ago, which was the main reason for its defeat. The Finnish victory was due to the efforts of the suicide squads, who destroyed the Suomussalmi and Uhtua railway, causing the Soviet supply lines to be cut off. Although the Soviet troops remained in the swamp near Paasonselkë, attempting to dig trenches and defend, they were surrounded by Finnish mechanized units on all sides and could not hold their ground. Finnish aircraft were dispatched to participate in the battle, dispersing the concentrated Soviet troops. When the Soviet troops passed over the frozen Vuokkijärvi lake, they were bombed by Finnish aircraft, causing many Soviet tanks to sink into the lake or become trapped in the ice, and hundreds of Soviet soldiers drowned. The Finnish army used Soviet machine guns and artillery captured a few days ago to fire on the Soviet troops, and used bombs dropped by Soviet planes that had not exploded to bomb the Soviet troops. (Reuters, 9th)

Helsinki – The General Headquarters announced in its afternoon war report that the victories we have achieved in recent days are the most important since the start of the war. In the past three weeks, our army has defeated three enemy divisions, one in the town of Tolvajärvi, one in the town of Suomussalmi, and the third between the towns of Suomussalmi and Raate. The Red Army retreated, abandoning a large number of military supplies, horses, ordnance, and other various supplies. Our army also captured a large number of Red Army soldiers, the total number of which should be between 1,000 and 1,500. Although the strength of the two sides is vastly different, our army has achieved a great victory by fighting one against ten. The weakness of the Red Army's combat capability and the demoralization of its morale can be seen from this. In addition, Soviet rear transportation is still extremely difficult. If more than half of the soldiers in the Red Army are killed or wounded, they still cannot be replenished. This is not the case with our army, which can be deployed freely, which is also one of the reasons for our victory. (Havas, 8th)

Helsinki – Looking at the overall situation of the Soviet-Finnish war, fierce fighting is still underway on the Salla front. Troops continue to increase north of Lake Ladoga. The war on the Karelian front is relatively quiet. Soviet aircraft are very active on the southern route of Finland. Finnish troops have a significant advantage on the Suomussalmi front near Raate. The war has been going on for four weeks. According to Finnish reports, 6,000 Soviet soldiers have been killed, while only 1,500 Finnish soldiers have been killed, and 1,000 Soviet soldiers have been captured. The Soviet army on this line began to attack in early December. The Finnish army retreated continuously. Although it regrouped near Suomussalmi, the Soviet army's equipment was superior, and the Finnish army continued to retreat. By mid-December, the Soviet army had concentrated its troops near Kijandajärvi and began a new offensive. At that time, Finnish reinforcements had also arrived, and they attacked the Soviet supply lines and cut off the connection between the Soviet 163rd and 44th Divisions. The Soviet army then retreated to Kijandajärvi, and a part of the army was surrounded by Finnish forces. Yesterday, after reinforcements, the Finnish army attacked the Soviet 44th Division on the Raate front and completely surrounded the division. The war is gradually shifting to Soviet territory. After six hours of fierce fighting, both sides suffered heavy casualties. According to Finnish sources, there are no Soviet troops in the triangle between Suomussalmi, Juntusranta, and Raate. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

Moscow – According to a communiqué issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there were no major developments on the front line eight days ago. There were activities of reconnaissance teams in the Ukhta and Petrozavodsk areas. At the same time, there was still artillery fire, machine gun fire, rifle fire, and sentry activity in the Karelian Isthmus. (TASS, 8th)

### US Government Submits Naval Expansion Plan to Congress, Advocates Increasing Strength by a Quarter

Washington – When the House Naval Affairs Committee meets in the coming days, Secretary of the Navy Edison and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark will attend and deliver speeches to explain the naval expansion plan submitted by the government to Congress. According to Secretary Edison, after the implementation of this plan, the strength of the US Navy will increase by 25% compared to the current level, in order to cope with the serious international situation. Admiral Stark said that the Washington Naval Treaty stipulated that the tonnage of battleships of the United States and Japan should be in a ratio of five to three, but this treaty has expired. The government's intention in submitting this naval expansion plan is to restore this ratio so that the US Navy can be in a superior position. In addition, since the outbreak of the war in Europe, all belligerent countries have been actively expanding their naval strength. If the United States does not catch up quickly, it will inevitably fall behind. The total cost of this expansion plan is $1.3 billion. It was originally planned to build 95 warships of various types, but now it has been decided to build 77 warships of various types with larger tonnage, as well as 31 other auxiliary ships. (Havas, 8th)

New York – US Navy Tactics Director Stiles testified yesterday before the House Naval Affairs Committee, asking Congress to approve an increase in naval funding of $1,300,000,000, because the international situation and the current situation in the Far East have the dangerous signs of a wildfire spreading across the world. Stiles claimed that if the United States does not immediately find a way to increase its naval strength, it will see the United States in a relatively weak position when the current war ends. The US shipbuilding program has been modified since its initial announcement, and it is planned to build some warships of a larger type than originally planned. (Reuters, 9th)

### US Aid to Finland, Notifies League of Nations

The American Red Cross and private organizations have provided medical, financial, and other assistance. They are also discussing with Finnish agencies the most effective way to continue and expand this assistance. (Reuters, 9th)

(Reuters, 9th)

Brussels – A Berlin dispatch from the Belgian news agency states that a large amount of war materials bound for Finland were seized while in transit through Germany. On the surface, these war materials seem to be from Italy. The German side has not yet explained the political or legal reasons for its seizure of war materials. (Reuters, 9th)

### US Democratic Party Annual Dinner, Roosevelt Delivers Speech, Partisan Discord Shameful Today

Washington – President Roosevelt said last night at the Democratic Party "Hundred Dollar" annual dinner, "Today, the American people recognize two facts: first, the world outside our hemisphere is now in a truly dire state. This is not a matter of pessimism or optimism, but a matter of reality. This is a major event, the significance of which is rarely grasped, and its impact is related to the future of the world. In connection with this, our minor partisan discord is shameful. Second, we have made great progress in our own economic prosperity and the security of every citizen at home." The reason why this banquet is called the Hundred Dollar Banquet is because party members attending the meeting must pay a fee of one hundred dollars. (Reuters, 9th)

### The Japanese Army Occupying Guangzhou's Movements Before a Large-Scale Attack North, Prohibiting Water and Land Traffic, Searching Merchants, Japanese Army Movements Not Allowed for Citizens to Watch

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese army, due to its defeat in attacking Guilin, has decided to gather troops stationed in various parts of Guangdong Province to invade the northwest Liangjiang with all its strength, hoping to contain the Chinese army fighting in Guangxi. Therefore, the Japanese army has been mobilizing to the front line for days, in a very chaotic manner. The situation is recorded as follows:

Citywide Alert

Since the entire line of the Lu-Xi Highway on the West River front was recovered by the Chinese Central Guerrilla Force, the Japanese army's front-line troops on the Guang-San Road retreated to the area between Shishan and Xiaotang. On the 13th and 14th, Japanese planes continuously took off from Guangzhou and flew to bomb the Lu-Xi (from Lubaoto Xinan) Highway. Bombing sounds were also faintly heard in the villages in the western district of Guangzhou. Rumors were rampant in the city, and people were agitated. All districts uniformly implemented martial law. Japanese military police bicycle teams patrolled the various districts of the city in rotation. Japanese puppet military police and intelligence police were also fully mobilized, and anyone suspicious was immediately inspected, detained, and interrogated. By the 16th, the martial law situation became even more tense. All main roads such as Huiai, Dadong, Yonghan, Yide, Longjin, Changshou, Taiping, Changdi, Sha Ji, Shangxiajiu, Datong, and even Huangsha, had Japanese military police and puppet police stationed at key traffic stations to closely inspect travelers and vehicles. All rural ferries moored along the west embankment were not allowed to dock or land from that day on, and were ordered to return to their original boats, and ordered to temporarily stop carrying passengers and goods to the city for three days from that day. The market price of Japanese military notes also fell again at the same time. The sale of kerosene and gasoline to the various rural areas was not allowed to be transported out of the Guangzhou city area from that day on. If it was necessary to sell them, a substantial store chapter was required to provide a guarantee and report to the Japanese military police headquarters for approval and issuance of a transport permit before it could be released. On the morning of the 16th, the Japanese planes that took off from Guangzhou to bomb various places totaled five batches from morning to dusk, each batch ranging from seven or eight to more than a dozen. In addition to flying to bomb the Lu-Xi Highway, they also flew to Guangxi Province and the southern section of the Yue-Han Road to wreak havoc. Again that evening, the Japanese military police headquarters, the garrison headquarters, the army special service agency, and the naval special service agency each sent a team of soldiers from each agency, and separately sent a Japanese officer to lead them, and jointly departed for Henan. By 4 a.m. on the morning of the 17th, they sent sentries, and divided them at the wharves on both sides of the Henan and Hebei, ordering the boats and rafts on both sides, and the horizontal ferries, to collectively sail to one place, and not to sail from this shore to the other, and not to carry passengers and goods back and forth. All ships and ferries were not allowed to sail to either shore. On the Haizhu Bridge side, the navy sent teams to tightly guard the two entrances of the bridge, and pedestrians were not allowed to pass back and forth. For a time, the water and land traffic in the north and south of Guangzhou Province was completely blocked and cut off. The reason for the blockade was that the Japanese army's secret report said that hundreds of guerrillas had already sneaked into Henan, taking advantage of this period of military tension, to carry out an uprising and attack the Japanese army. Therefore, the four military agencies, the Japanese military police headquarters, etc., sent troops to Henan to conduct inspections on merchants in sections. The period of household registration inspection was temporarily set for three days. All residents of Henan were not allowed to go out during this period, and each person was not allowed to go out during this period, and each person was not allowed to go to Henan during this period. By the 19th, rural ferries were slightly allowed to come to the city, but only those who originally docked at the Huangsha No. 8 Inspection Office's wharf and those who were operated by manpower were allowed. Other rural ferries and steamships were still not allowed to sail to the city. Unexpectedly, starting at 12:00 that day, the Japanese army once again implemented emergency martial law, and the city's water and land traffic was completely cut off. The reason for the martial law was purely for the mobilization of troops.

Troop Reinforcements

The Japanese side was as anxious as fire to mobilize troops to attack the northwest Liangjiang. Therefore, the troops in Guangzhou were sent out as much as possible. At about 3 a.m. on the 16th, all the garrison teams in Xiaobei, Dongshan, and Weixin Road set off at night and concentrated at the Japanese Garrison Headquarters, which was originally the Chentang Branch Bureau, and set off for Huangsha, where they transferred to warships and set off. It took from 3 a.m. until 6 a.m. after dawn to complete the departure. The streets of Weixin, Huiai, Huifu, Zhuji, and Datong in the city all night heard the sound of Japanese troops departing and coming and going, one after another. On the afternoon of the 16th, the Japanese military police team originally stationed at Sipailou Panfu Road and Changshou Road removed their armbands and were temporarily incorporated into the infantry and set off in a hurry that night. From 12:00 that night until dawn on the morning of the 17th, the departure was completed. Citizens still heard the sound of military horses and soldiers departing and coming and going on the road all night. In the past week, due to the impact of the Japanese army's military defeat, martial law was tightened in the city, and the original Japanese army guard checkpoints at various traffic roads that had been abolished were also restored and set up. By the 17th, the Japanese army guard checkpoints in various parts of the city, except for the Huangsha Wharf, the east and west bridges of Shamian, Haizhu Bridge, Dongchuan Road, Xicun, Zengbu, the end of Xihua Road, Pantang, and Sansheng Society, were still set up, with two to four Japanese soldiers at each checkpoint. The Japanese soldiers at the remaining guard checkpoints in the city had all been transferred elsewhere. The Japanese army stationed in Jiangcun Gaotang had also been completely withdrawn. It was found that this Japanese army was transferred to the Yingzuizhan front line of the Beijiang to reinforce it. At about 12:00 p.m. on the 19th, the Japanese army in the city continued to be dispatched and departed one after another. All the roads were full of Japanese soldiers on guard. All pedestrians on the road were driven to turn into the local shops to hide and hide. After being driven into the houses, all the people in the houses were only allowed to sit facing the wall or sit with their backs to the door, and they were not allowed to face the street. Once it was discovered that they were looking at the street or peeking secretly, they would be beaten severely after entering the house. The shops in the areas through which the departing troops passed, such as Sha Ji Datong Road, Shangxiajiu Road, Panfu Road, and Huiai Road, were ordered to close their doors one by one before they passed through, and were strictly forbidden to look out. Until the troops had completely passed through, they were allowed to open the doors. Therefore, when the troops departed and passed through, not only the shops on the various streets along the way were closed, but it can be said that there was not a single person on the street except for Japanese soldiers. Even the boats and rafts on the Sha Ji and Huangsha river surface were uniformly closed with hatches and boat windows, and were only allowed to sit quietly in the cabin with curtains drawn, and were not allowed to look out. In the house, only the sound of military vehicles passing by, the sound of military weapons pressing the road, and the sound of the troops' footsteps were heard. It was heard that the departing troops were drawn back to the city from the east line originally stationed on the Guangjiu Road and transferred to the northwest Liangjiang to respond. The alert situation can be said to be extremely serious. However, this is only the martial law situation on the land. The water situation is also equally serious and tense. After 11 a.m. that morning, four Japanese armed fishing boats and two electric boats patrolled back and forth from the Huangsha Ruyifang river surface to the Baishachongkou, driving all the large and small ships near that area to the Datan Nine Inner Chong and the east and west Chong belonging to Baisha, and the embankments on both sides to hide and hide. The large cargo boats, plate boats, and Zidong boats, etc., which could not sail into the inner Chong to hide due to their larger area, were uniformly driven to the river bank, ordering the men and women on board to lie down in the cabin, and not to sit or lie down on the bow or stern of the boat, or look out, and the armed boats and electric boats patrolled back and forth to monitor them remotely. On the Ruyifang river surface, a male boatman was found peeking out of the cabin window and was shot through the head with a gun by a Japanese soldier on an electric boat, and was pushed into the water. The reason why the water was so closely guarded was that at that time, a large number of Japanese soldiers were transferred back to Guangzhou from the Guangyun Highway. It was estimated that there were more than 60 vehicles transported by transport vehicles, more than 200 horses, and a large batch of luggage and military supplies. The number of troops was heard to have been transferred back from the Guangsan Road and various places on the west line. After being transported to the Guangyun Highway Wharf, the troops were transferred to military ships moored on the Bai'etan river surface in batches with three transports. It was not until 3:00 that the transportation was completed.

### Chinese Army Zhang Yi's Troops Recovers Funing County

A person from Funing talked about the Japanese army, which had been occupying Funing for a year. Last month, Zhang Yi, the brigade commander of the Second Security Brigade of Jiangsu Province, because his hometown had been occupied for a long time, asked the government to lead a battalion of the Fourth Regiment and two companies of the Third Regiment to attack Funing. The guerrillas surrounded the four sides of the city, causing the Japanese army to dare not leave the city gate for a step. On the night of December 26, Zhang selected 50 daredevils, each carrying a hand grenade and a Browning pistol, and climbed into the city, attacking in different directions. The Japanese army woke up from their dreams, at a loss, and retreated northward, leaving behind many horses and luggage. By dawn, more than a dozen Japanese corpses were found. The county history was thus restored. Now the residents of the city have moved back one after another.

### Revisions by the Ministry of Education for Loan Types for Students from War Zones in Colleges and Above: Divided into Three Types – Full Board, Half Board, and Special Allowance Loans

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education, in order to provide relief to students from war zones, previously established interim measures and supplementary measures for student loans in public colleges and above, as well as interim measures for cotton clothing allowance loans. Now, due to rising prices everywhere, the loan amounts received by impoverished students from war zones are insufficient for their needs. The loan amounts have been temporarily increased, and the loan types have been revised into the following three types:

(1) Food allowance loans are divided into half-board and full-board, with the amounts determined separately based on the cost of living in each region.

(2) Allowance loans are set at three yuan per 'shi' (unit of measurement). The number of students eligible for this loan shall not exceed 60% of the total number of loan recipients from war zones.

(3) Special loans (divided into clothing and books) amount to twenty yuan in total per student per semester for the full amount, and ten yuan for half the amount. Applications can be made once per semester. The number of students eligible for this loan shall not exceed 10% of the total number of loan recipients from war zones. Impoverished students from war zones may be granted half or full food allowance loans by their schools. Those who are even more impoverished may be granted allowance loans. Those who are truly the most impoverished may be granted half or full special loans. Schools may begin processing student loans for war zone students from January of the 29th year (1940) in accordance with the above measures. The Ministry of Education also instructed schools to strictly review loan applications to ensure that only genuinely impoverished students from war zones receive loans. The loan funds required by national colleges and above may still be requested from the Ministry of Education. The loan funds required by provincial and private colleges and above may also be requested from the Ministry of Education for appropriate subsidies. Schools applying to the Ministry of Education for loan funds should still do so within two weeks after the start of each semester. As for the amount of student food allowance loans for each school, it is reported that the amount varies from seven to fourteen yuan depending on the cost of living in the location of each school.

Match Highlights

After the two teams engaged, the Army/Navy Joint Team had strong momentum, frequently pressing the Chinese-Western Allied Team. After 21 minutes of melee, Daffy Road detoured into the Chinese-Western Allied Team's territory. Maxwell Road and Bi Li-ban attempted to intercept him, but Daffy Road, with no way forward, passed the ball into the center. Fireburn arrived in support, and Hua Lu rushed forward to resist. Fireburn fired from 25 yards away, and the ball rolled along the ground and went straight into the net from the right corner. The Army/Navy Joint Team opened the scoring. After 31 minutes, Zhuo Shi-jin and Fu La combined, and Li Hui-tang suddenly broke into the center. Lees rushed forward to resist, but Li Hui-tang, seizing the opportunity, powerfully swept the ball, and it grazed the post and went into the net, making it 1-1. After 33 minutes, the entire Army/Navy Joint Team still launched a fierce five-pronged attack. Wai Gan-chen passed the ball long to Ho Sik. At this time, the Chinese-Western Allied Team's territory was in a state of emergency. In the chaotic melee, Ho Sik delivered another good news, and the Army/Navy Joint Team took a 2-1 lead again. After the lemon break, the Chinese-Western Allied Team hoped to reverse the defeat and fought even harder. After 16 minutes, Lees fouled Gao-shan-nu within 12 yards, resulting in a penalty kick. Li Hui-tang kicked the ball in, making it 2-2 again. After regaining lost ground, the Chinese-Western Allied Team launched a full-scale attack, but the Army/Navy's defense was strong, and Robinson's saves were effective, allowing them to turn the danger into safety. Three minutes before the end of the game, the Army/Navy Joint Team launched a nationwide attack, and although they were able to approach the city walls, Hou Rong-sheng, Hua Li-ban, and Zhang Rong-cai calmly responded, turning swords into plowshares. At the end of the game, both sides drew with 2 goals each, and the troops withdrew. The formation is as follows:

### Shanghai Municipal Council Publicly Announces the Details of the Incident Involving Mr. Fessenden: Summary Based on Police Reports; Fu Xiao-an Acknowledged the Capture of the Perpetrators

Since Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was suddenly shot by thugs, many have inquired with the Council about the details of the incident and the progress of apprehending the perpetrators. Given the public's concern about this case, the Council's Intelligence Department has prepared a summary of the events and subsequent investigations based on police reports, as follows:

(Details of the Incident)

At approximately 8:50 AM on the 6th of this month, Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was traveling east along Avenue Haig (now Huashan Road) in his personal car (driven by his personal military chauffeur). When his car reached about 100 yards west of Avenue Ferguson (now Wukang Road), just outside the Lilac Garden, one of the public rickshaws parked on the north side of the road suddenly crossed the road in front of Mr. Fessenden's car, causing the car to slow down. At this time, another rickshaw, pushed by its puller, crashed violently into the mudguard and bumper of the car's rear. As a result, the chauffeur had to stop the car immediately. The puller of the second rickshaw then pulled out a handgun from under his short coat and fired several shots. Eight bullets hit the left side of the car's body. According to the police's ordnance identification unit's subsequent inspection, at least three handguns were used at the time. Fortunately, Mr. Fessenden and his chauffeur were not injured. After the incident, the chauffeur, on Mr. Fessenden's orders, immediately drove the car forward at high speed to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Mr. Fessenden's car remained at the scene for only a few seconds.

(Police Investigation)

After receiving the report, the police immediately dispatched a large number of officers to the scene. They found a newspaper deliveryman named Yue Heshang (transliteration) who witnessed the incident. According to the deliveryman, he witnessed the incident and saw a Chinese man standing on the north sidewalk kneeling down, pulling out a Mauser pistol, and firing several shots at Mr. Fessenden's car. After Mr. Fessenden's car escaped, two other Chinese men joined the man and fled east along Avenue Haig. While investigating near the scene, a Chinese detective from the police learned from an employee of the Xinxin gambling den in the Zhu Family Residence of Kunlian that three Chinese men had been captured in a grass shed behind the gambling den by members of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army (translated meaning) of the Chinese Nationalist Party and taken to the nearby First Branch Station. When the three men were arrested, they were changing clothes, and each had a Mauser pistol. After receiving this report, the chief detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station immediately visited a senior official of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Police Bureau at 11-13 Avenue Joffre (now Middle Huaihai Road) to convey the information obtained by the police and requested confirmation. After making several phone calls, the official informed the chief detective that the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army of the Chinese Nationalist Party had captured three men in possession of handguns and detained them at the Zhu Family Ferry (transliteration) Branch Station. The official also said that regarding other aspects of the case, inquiries should be made with the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on Avenue Joffre.

(Rickshaw Puller's Report)

At 9:45 AM on January 6, two rickshaw pullers reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. At 11:00 AM on the same day, another rickshaw puller also went to the police station. According to the pullers, at 6:00 AM that morning, they were pulling their rickshaws in various parts of the Western District, looking for passengers. A Chinese man approached them and ordered them to pull the rickshaws to an alley on Avenue Joffre across from Rongqing Lane (transliteration). There, they saw a large number of armed men. Three of them forced the pullers to change clothes. Then, two others, carrying Mauser pistols, took them to a nearby teahouse and detained them. Shortly after 9:00 AM, they were released and told that they could find their rickshaws in a vacant lot behind the teahouse. Because they could not find their lost rickshaws, the pullers went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report the incident. Police officers found three abandoned rickshaws at the scene, which the pullers identified as their own.

(Rumors of Capture)

In the afternoon of January 6, Mayor Fu Xiao-an visited Mr. Fessenden to express his condolences and congratulations on his escape. He said that he had received a phone call that morning stating that the perpetrators had been captured by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Police.

(Japanese Denial)

On January 6 and 7, the Special Deputy Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police and the Criminal Division of the Police Headquarters repeatedly requested the Japanese Military Police Headquarters at the Sichuan Road Bridge to hand over the perpetrators. However, at 12:30 PM on the 7th, Major Hayashi and Major Fujino of the Japanese side notified the Criminal Division of the Police Headquarters that they had not arrested any perpetrators in connection with the case.

### Various Banks Maintain People's Livelihood: Undertaking Rice and Grain Mortgages; Hope for Reporting of Hoarding and Profiteering Based on Facts; Group Orders of Foreign Rice Have Already Shipped 600 Tons to Shanghai

A reporter yesterday inquired about the Shanghai People's Livelihood Adjustment Association's fund matters, visiting Wu Yunqi of the fund management committee. According to him, when the association was first established, the initial intention was to raise funds to order foreign rice. Recently, some people proposed raising funds for price-stabilizing sales, which has also been initiated and is being carried out simultaneously. As for the purchase of foreign rice through Jincheng Bank, 189,240 yuan has already been received, enough to order over 900 tons. Currently, 600 tons of high-quality rice have been purchased. Once the warehousing procedures are complete, the remaining unpaid amount will be temporarily mortgaged to the bank, and customers will prepare funds to gradually take delivery of the goods. If various groups and customers continuously order foreign rice in cycles, so as to ensure a smooth flow of rice supply, the serious rice shortage problem can be gradually alleviated. Previously, most banks were unwilling to undertake rice and grain mortgages to avoid misunderstandings, but after this sharp rise in rice prices, various sectors of society hope that more rice and grain mortgages will be undertaken. Banks should do their best to undertake them. However, if there are those who hoard and profiteer, the Municipal Council naturally has appropriate measures to deal with them. It is deeply hoped that all sectors of society will report them based on facts and impose sanctions, rather than simply harboring grudges to satisfy personal desires. In reality, rice and grain are bulky and not as easy to hide as small goods. Furthermore, the price-stabilizing sales committee hopes that the banking industry will donate 100,000 yuan for the price-stabilizing sales fund, and the industry has already resolved to donate the full amount.

High-Quality Rice Price

Xin Sheng She reports that the first batch of 600 tons (equivalent to 6,000 bags) of Saigon foreign rice ordered by the procurement committee of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Association has already arrived in Shanghai. Each bag costs approximately 43.83 yuan in national currency. The association has already contacted banks to arrange advances and withdraw the deposits from Jincheng Bank in order to handle the delivery procedures. As for the second batch, another order will soon be placed overseas.

Price-Stabilizing Sales Meeting

After accepting the appointment to handle price-stabilizing sales, the Rice Dealers' Association has designated 100 member rice shops in the two concessions to handle the sales: 60 in the International Settlement and 40 in the French Concession. The price will be 6.5 jin per yuan, with a limit of one yuan per person. Price-stabilizing sales are scheduled to begin on January 18th. Each shop is required to sell 50 bags per day, from 1:00 PM until sold out. The association has scheduled a meeting with over 100 member shops within the day, to be held on the sixth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association on Avenue Edward VII, to discuss the implementation.

Price-Stabilizing Sales Donations

The price-stabilizing sales donations already determined by the Shanghai Price-Stabilizing Sales Committee have reached over 300,000 yuan, with over 30,000 yuan already paid. Yesterday, a Mr. Zhu personally visited the committee to voluntarily donate 100 yuan. The committee hopes that people from all walks of life will show compassion and contribute grain and money. Furthermore, the committee today sent letters to the Public Works Departments of the International and French Concessions and the Municipal Council, detailing the establishment of the committee and the commencement of price-stabilizing sales on January 18th, requesting their assistance and protection at that time.

Distributing Buns for Relief

The Joint Relief Association of Charity Groups began distributing buns for relief ahead of schedule yesterday. The distribution location is in the area of South Longmen Road in the Racecourse. The distribution time is from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Yesterday, being the first day, the number of people waiting for relief was not large, so the association planned to use eight bags of wheat flour, making approximately 4,000 buns, and distribute them widely. Subsequently, relief will continue to be distributed every evening from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM until the end of the Lunar New Year.

Japanese Actions

The North China Daily News reports that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated yesterday (the 8th) when hosting news reporters that the rice and grain that the Japanese authorities promised to transport to Shanghai to alleviate the city's rice shortage is now being sold in various districts north of the Suzhou Creek.

### Japanese Military Police Attempt to Kidnap Chinese in the Concession; Foiled by the Arrival of Police Officers; So-Called "Anti-Japanese" Evidence Lacking

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that on Saturday morning, Japanese people attempted to kidnap three Chinese men and one woman on Yu Yuan Road. It is reported that 12 Japanese military police officers broke into a house on a concession road within the British defense zone without prior notification to the concession authorities. Fortunately, personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Police arrived at the scene in time and stopped the Japanese kidnapping operation, arresting them all and taking them to the Jing'an Temple police station. The Japanese claimed that the four Chinese were engaged in anti-Japanese propaganda and therefore intended to arrest them. The police station asked the Japanese to provide evidence, but the Japanese claimed that no evidence was needed. However, the police department disagreed and did not allow the Japanese to arbitrarily arrest people. The four Chinese were detained by the police department until Saturday night before being released.

### British Warships Transporting on the Yangtze River Encounter Rejection; Small Warships Monitor; Unable to Load Cargo

Foreign ships traveling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, namely the ports of Beisha, Haimen, and Qidong, are often followed and monitored by Japanese warships. These Japanese warships also frequently fire guns and cannons at the ports, causing barges within the ports to be afraid to leave. Therefore, the loading and unloading of goods is obstructed in an invisible way. This is especially true for British merchant ships, even more so than for merchant ships flying the German and Italian flags, often resulting in empty ships traveling back and forth. According to shipping merchants, the Japanese warships patrolling that area are said to be heading to Guangdong, so merchant ships have slightly more convenience. Unexpectedly, yesterday, a crew member of a ship returning to Shanghai from Beisha reported that the Japanese warship that had previously been obstructing them was no longer seen. However, there is now a small warship converted from a merchant ship stationed outside the port of Sanhe. Therefore, the ship was unable to load cargo when it previously sailed (i.e., sailed to Beisha) or when returning to Shanghai. This shows that while German and Italian merchant ships can still maintain transportation between Qidong, Haimen, and this city, British ships are subject to even stricter surveillance by Japanese warships.

### National Reconstruction Bonds to be Drawn Today; Over 10 Million Yuan in Principal and Interest; Payment Expected by the End of February

The eighth drawing of principal redemption for the 25th Year (1936) National Unified Bonds has already been held by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The various bonds of types A, B, C, D, and E that were drawn, as well as the principal and interest due, total 56,476,600 yuan. Payment is expected to be made by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications starting January 31st. The eighth drawing of principal redemption for the 25th Year (1936) National Reconstruction Bonds is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM today. The various bonds drawn, as well as the interest due, total 11,154,300 yuan. Payment is expected to be made starting February 29th. The procedures will be announced by the Ministry of Finance at that time.

### New Regulations for Examining Documents for German Goods Passing Through Vietnam for Chinese Merchants; Must be Sent to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; To be Handled by Chinese Consulates

Most of the goods shipped from this port to the Southwest pass through Vietnam as a shortcut, so freight transport is frequent. It is now known that German goods handled by Chinese merchants passing through Vietnam recently must be examined by the French government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs before they will be released. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the Governor of Vietnam to comply and has also notified the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, Vietnam. The Chamber then notified the Sino-French Express Transport Company in this port yesterday. The original letter is quoted below: "We have recently received a letter dated December 27th, Yue Zi No. 10995, from the Consulate General in Hanoi, which states: 'We have recently received a letter from the Governor of Vietnam stating that regarding German goods, we have received instructions from Paris that the owner of the goods must submit all valid documents proving payment before September 3rd to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review before they can be released.' We have also received a letter from the General Directorate of Customs of Vietnam sending procedures for submitting German goods documents for review, which briefly state that the owner of the goods must directly send the relevant valid documents to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.' It has been found that merchants have documents for all German goods purchased, but due to the submission procedures, if they are handled individually, it is inevitable that they will be unclear about the steps and delay the time. Furthermore, these documents are extremely important, and if they are lost, there is no way to investigate. In view of this, the Consulate intends to request that your association notify all merchants to collect these documents and send them to the Consulate

to be sent to the Embassy in Paris to be submitted to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review nearby. In addition to having telegraphed this intention to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval, we are writing to you for your information and hope you will handle it as soon as possible.' Having received this, we should comply. In addition to sending separate letters, we are writing to you for your information. If you have such goods, you must handle them quickly and inform the merchants."

### The Interior of West Shanghai is Tense Again; Rumors of the New Fourth Army Approaching; Already Reaching Near Huangdu

According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the situation in the interior of West Shanghai has become tense again recently. It is rumored that Chinese guerrillas and the New Fourth Army are advancing on the outskirts of Shanghai from Changzhou and Wuxi along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Shanghai-Wuxi and Shanghai-Taicang Highways. By waterway, they have reached Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, Baihegang, and Huangdu, approaching West Shanghai. Therefore, in addition to sending teams by land to reinforce defenses in various places, the Japanese have also banned navigation by waterway.

### Post-War Passenger Ships from Various Countries are Slow; Passenger Costs Frequently Increase; One-Third Higher Than Before the War

Since the outbreak of the European War, the passenger ships of various countries operating on the Far East-Europe routes have become scarce because some of the ships have been transferred back to their home countries. To avoid dangerous voyages, British and French passenger ships still do not announce sailing dates. According to news from the shipping industry recently, in recent months, passenger ships from various countries arriving in Shanghai have often been blocked along the way, often staying indefinitely in mid-voyage. Currently, a one-way trip takes at least one month or more, which is more than 20 days slower than before the war. This is not only the case for the ships of belligerent countries, but also for the ships of non-belligerent countries, which also require the same amount of time. Therefore, passenger costs have frequently increased. It is estimated that the burden of travel expenses after the war has increased by an average of one-third per person.

### Ministry of Finance Determined to Stabilize Currency System; Black Market Legal Tender Strong; Exchange Rate Against British and US Currencies Up by an Average of One-Quarter; Progress in Coordination with the Establishment of the Joint Office of the Four Banks

After the Ministry of Finance resolved to stabilize the currency system, it made every effort to adjust foreign trade to improve trade and consolidate the foreign exchange base. The entire trade has now turned into a trade surplus since November of last year. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee purchased foreign exchange from the black market in Shanghai and other places to replenish the fund. As for the legal tender, the cash reserves are sufficient, and the value remains unchanged. The black market price of legal tender has become stronger, rising by an average of one-quarter. This upward trend is continuing. The exchange rate against the British currency has risen from about 4.5 pence to 5.5 pence, and the exchange rate against the US currency has risen from about 7.5 yuan to 9 yuan. According to inquiries made by a reporter from Xin Sheng She to the banking industry, the reasons for the strong black market price of legal tender are approximately: (1) After the establishment of the joint office of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, the legal tender has been further regulated; (2) After the outbreak of the European War, the currency prices of the belligerent countries fell, prompting the legal tender to strengthen; (3) The belligerent countries increased exchange controls and taxes, and imposed considerable restrictions on various operations, with Britain being no exception. Britain has territories all over the world, and even more territories in the East. Funds that had previously fled from China to these places have fled again and returned to the country; (4) The flight of capital from Hong Kong; (5) The trade has turned into a trade surplus, and the Shanghai Customs trade deficit has been eliminated; (6) Merchants speculate and manipulate, even exaggerating the so-called atmosphere of "peace."

### Letter from Regiment Commander Xie of the Four Banks' Lone Army to Industrial and Commercial Circles

Regiment Commander Jin Yuan of the Four Banks' Lone Army yesterday issued a letter to industrial and commercial circles, saying that since the fall of Shanghai, prices have skyrocketed, and the general wage-earning class has been forced to demand increases in wages and salaries and in the timing of closing accounts in order to make a living, resulting in personnel frictions and leading to strikes and work stoppages. In this day of the unprecedented greatness of our nation, such a phenomenon cannot but be said to be unfortunate. I believe that all matters can be resolved under reasonable and fair principles, especially since this is not the time to "cook beans on beanstalks." Shanghai has an abnormal prosperity, and all industries and businesses are making huge profits. They should be mindful of the livelihood of their employees and should help and cooperate with each other. In the present situation, any party leaning towards extremes will hardly gain the sympathy of the public. Take the labor dispute at Wing On Company as an example. Wing On Company has a long history and an outstanding reputation. Both parties should maintain the friendship of harmony and harmony in the past, give way to each other, and must not stick to their own opinions, seeking revenge out of anger and seeking pleasure for a moment. It must be known that when the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact. Today, all those of Chinese descent should inspire their conscience, and mutual strife will only sadden our relatives and gladden our enemies. I sincerely appeal to both sides to calm down and seek a solution. Otherwise, they should accept the reasonable and fair mediation of impartial people such as Yu Qiaqing and Lin Kanghou. It is especially hoped that legal professionals, national legislation, to protect human rights, all legitimate demands that are compelled by livelihood and do not hinder public order, should be given equal consideration in terms of human sentiment and national law. If they can come forward to mediate according to legal principles, the country and society will benefit from it.

### Japanese Monopoly on Eggs; Most Foreign Merchants Suspend Operations; Mitsui Firmly Denies Monopoly; However, Transporting Eggs Requires Mitsui's Permission

The Continental News reports that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy here denied yesterday (the 8th) that the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha had monopolized eggs. It is reported that Mitsui asked the spokesman to state that the company had not monopolized this matter and does not intend to do so. The current misconception is just that, a false rumor. The companies are in negotiations with the Japanese side to

(obtain permission) to send their own egg collectors to the interior rather than purchasing from the Japanese, as is currently the case. Eggs transported from the interior must be permitted. The difficulty in transporting eggs in the past was due to the investigation of whether the permits were valid. The eggs that Mitsui had previously seized from various companies in Shanghai have all been returned to their original owners. Foreign merchants are not surprised by the rumor that a certain large Japanese trading company, presumably Mitsui Bussan Kaisha,

(has completed a monopoly) of the Chinese egg industry plan. It is reported that although the inside story of the new trading company is unknown, the number of eggs transported by foreign merchants to Shanghai for export since October last year has been very small. Although the Japanese have allowed special permits from the military authorities to pass, most egg merchants here have been forced to suspend operations. It is said that the Japanese have allowed some

(Chinese merchants to transport eggs) to Shanghai, but they must obtain permission from Mitsui. These Chinese merchants are said to have started to be controlled by the Japanese two months ago. The Japanese established the Chenghua Trading Company on January 1st to monopolize the egg industry.

### US Church Donations to China Exceed 5 Million Yen; Fundraising Continues Unaffected by European War; Administrative Expenses Extremely Low, Only 6,000 Yuan in Legal Tender

The Continental News reports that according to Mr. Hill White, secretary of the Relief Committee organized by the American Catholic Church and the Protestant Church, the committee has raised relief funds in various parts of the United States to help the poor in China, totaling more than 5 million yuan. The Shanghai American Advisory Committee is responsible for managing the funds. The amount that has been distributed includes 3,426,467.62 yuan in legal tender, 121,652.40 US dollars, and 3,000 Hong Kong dollars. In the past two years, the committee has allocated

(in Shanghai) 207,500 yuan in legal tender and 1,000 US dollars. Part of this was allocated to the Nanshi Refugee Area Management Committee. The largest recipient was the Chengdu West China Committee, with a total of 450,000 yuan in legal tender. The second largest was the Kaifeng International Relief Association, with 3 million yuan. The Advisory Committee's

(administrative expenses) are extremely low, only 6,814.38 yuan in legal tender, less than 1/500th of the total expenditure. Telegraphic expenses totaled 1,156.39 yuan. Apart from the salary of the stenographer, all others are volunteers. The offices of various churches in Shanghai also cooperate with the work of the Advisory Committee. From the time the Advisory Committee was organized and established in October 1937 to June 1938, it only allocated funds in 12 cases. But from June 1938 to December last year, the

(number of allocations) has increased to more than 200 cases. The committee carefully and quickly studies applications from all over the country to determine whether to allocate funds. In December, it received applications for 926,000 yuan, but only 305,000 yuan was issued. The American Church Committee's

(fundraising) movement is still ongoing. The impact of the European War has not been as severe as expected. Americans are still very concerned about the events in the Far East and the Chinese people. The honorary members of the Advisory Committee include US Ambassador to China Johnson, US Consul General in Shanghai Gauss, International Relief Association Dr. Baker, and St. John's University Medical Advisor Dr. McLagan, Chairman Major Bassett, Treasurer Fuller, and many other members.

### Japan Has Not Yet Acknowledged Assault on American Woman by Sentry; Japanese Spokesman Claims to be Studying the Victim's Detailed Report

Regarding the case of the assault on American citizen Miss Donaldson by a Japanese Marine sentry, the Japanese Consulate General has replied to the protest from the US Consulate General, saying that the Japanese side is continuing to investigate the matter in order to get to the bottom of it. After receiving this reply, the US Consulate prepared a detailed report, which was personally signed by Miss Donaldson in person, and submitted it to the Japanese Consulate. According to the Japanese spokesman, the Japanese side is currently studying Miss Donaldson's detailed report.

### Resumption of Warfare on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line; Changes to Jiangsu Province Postal Delivery Procedures; Remittance by District Limited or Temporarily Suspended; Large Packages Along and Transferring Through the Line Suspended

Since the market towns along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and various places in northern Jiangsu have become war zones, traffic is congested, and postal services are inevitably difficult. The Transportation Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration is still trying to dredge the postal service. Whether it is parcels, remittances, or mail, they are dispatched and delivered in sequence. Now, because warfare has resumed in some of these places, it is quite difficult to transport mail by train. The Bureau has already changed its approach. The details are recorded as follows.

Remittance Limit

The limit is temporarily 500 yuan per person for Nanjing, Shangxinhe, and Jiangyin; 300 yuan for Wujin, etc.; 200 yuan for Xiannvmiao, Tongli, Jintan, and Naner; 100 yuan for Luhe, Guazhou, Changjing, Gaozi, Qishuyan, Xueyanqiao, Shengze, Jiaoxi, Qixia, Ronggang, and Hengjing; 50 yuan for Dingjia, Diaojiapu, Dagang, Jiangdu, Wujiang, Lusi, Peixian, Dongshan, Qingyang, Shaobo, Menghe, Gaoqiao, Liancheng, Pengcha, Lishui, Hushu Pass, Lili, Sima, Jianbi, Touqiao, Henglin, Qutang, Longgang Town, Yancheng, Donggou, and Qinnan Cangfan; 40 yuan for Jijia City and Fengxian; 30 yuan for Yilin, Xinfeng, Chenjiagang, and Yangshuyuan; 10 yuan for Bayi Ji and Xiangshuikou and Suqian; and 20 yuan for all other remittance offices other than the above. For the above places, each yuan should be charged a supplement ranging from 2 to 5 cents, and the remittance fee is uniformly 1 cent, except for Nanjing where only half a cent is charged per yuan and Wuxi where 7.5 mils are charged.

Temporary Suspension of Payment

Temporary suspension of payment includes Shangtu, Nishui, Xiba, Yanghuaji, Hexing Town, Shuyang, Funing, Siyang, Guanhu, Pixian, Jieshou, Gaochun, Zhenwumiao, Xushe Town, Huaiyin, Huai'an, Zhongxing, Liyang, Xin'an Town, Lianshui, Yaowan, Fanchuan, Wanxian, Baoying, Ganyu, and Huduo. As for those charging a 5-cent supplement, they include Taixian, Yangshuyuan, Jiangyan, Taixing, Longgang Town, Yanghe, Shigang, and Yancheng. Those not charging a supplement include Shagou and Butou.

Parcel Suspension

The Parcel Business Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration has temporarily suspended the acceptance of all large and small parcels to the cities and towns along the Shanghai-Nanjing Line and in northern Jiangsu. Their announcement is quoted below: "Due to transportation difficulties, all large parcels sent to the Shanghai-Nanjing Line and its transfer offices should be temporarily suspended from acceptance. However, individual and pharmaceutical parcels to those places may still be accepted as usual. This announcement." According to inquiries made by a reporter from Xin Sheng She, for mail in Jiangsu Province, all light mail such as ordinary letters, express letters, registered letters, and postcards are accepted and dispatched as usual, and transported by Shanghai-Nanjing train on a daily basis.

### Safety First Movement Effective; Fewer Traffic Violations

In order to protect the safety of pedestrians and vehicles, the Shanghai Municipal Council initiated the Safety First movement, which has been quite effective. However, there are still many traffic violations. According to the Bureau's statistics, the number of vehicle violation reports received last month totaled 1,716. Among them, 612 cases (75 foreigners and 537 Chinese) have been prosecuted in court, and the remaining cases have been given written warnings or recorded for disciplinary action. In order to improve road safety, the Bureau sent two lecturers to tea houses, factories, and refugee shelters to give 153 lectures on the topic of "Seeking Safety While Walking," with approximately 8,985 listeners. Work will continue to be dispatched this month.

### Memorial Service for Ma Xiangbo Scheduled

To be Held on the 27th of This Month; Soliciting Memorial Essays and Eulogies from All Sectors

The Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for Mr. Ma Xiangbo from All Sectors of Shanghai held its fourth meeting of chief secretaries at 4:00 PM yesterday. Li Wenjie, Han Jingqi, Ge Futian, Zhang Guoquan, Jin Guanfu, Chen Peide, and Long Xiaoyun attended.

### A Letter to Correct Bad Habits; Hoping that the Tram and Bus Authorities Will Pay Attention; Both Adjusting Wages and Improving Morality are Needed

The North China Daily News published a letter from Mr. Jia yesterday, asking the Public Concession Tram and Bus Company authorities to find ways to correct the bad habit of "skimming" by ticket sellers, which is sufficient to represent the views of the general public. Its content is roughly as follows: "I am a Chinese, and I deeply know that this unfortunate bad habit among Chinese people is one of the reasons for our country's weakness. Now, driven by conscience, I ask the Public Concession Tram and Bus Company authorities to find ways to correct it. Any Chinese person who takes the welfare of the nation as the premise, witnessing this shameful habit openly prevailing, and most Chinese passengers and responsible persons of the companies turning a blind eye, it is truly heartbreaking. Some say that those who suffer losses are just the 'Shangers' (workers) of the company, but this kind of argument is an indirect endorsement of the immoral behavior of Chinese people and is also short-sighted. If the company says it is unable to prevent its employees from doing this, so that its shareholders and noble Chinese people will not suffer economic and moral losses, it cannot justify itself. If the reason is that the wages of the employees are too low, the company should often adjust them. The number of wage increases is limited, compared with the invisible outflow of fares, it cannot be measured in terms of reason. Moreover, the fare has already been increased repeatedly.

The lives of employees are becoming increasingly difficult, and the company should often take this into account. Some foreigners view 'skimming' as a characteristic of Chinese people, which is not true. In fact, any Chinese person who wishes his compatriots to eliminate bad habits, when he sees someone who can stand up and do it, he regards it as the glory of the entire nation."

### Atlantic Restaurant Arrest Case; Shan Bin Released

Mr. Zhang, Who Was Arrested at the Same Time, Was Released That Night

She Wen She reports that at 7:00 PM on the 29th of last month, the Japanese side, together with the Public Concession patrolmen, went to the Atlantic Restaurant on Fuzhou Road and arrested Shan Bin (also known as Wen Yu), a Funing native, and a Mr. Zhang, who were hosting a banquet in Room No. 1. Afterwards, the Japanese side, together with the French patrolmen, dispatched personnel to search Shan's house at No. 29 Renshou Lane on Caishi Road, but found nothing. It is now learned that the Japanese side released Shan yesterday because there was no substantial evidence in the case and it was found that Shan was indeed unrelated. As for Mr. Zhang, he was released that night.

### City Residents Group Donation Revenue Reaches 360,000 Yuan

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens Group Solicitation Committee recently released a report on the donations received since its establishment, as follows: During the broadcast period, 94,635.417 yuan was received. In January of the 28th year, 12,580.025 yuan was received. In February, 22,999.04 yuan. In March, 31,221.71 yuan. In April, 18,588.32 yuan. In May, 18,619.05 yuan. In June, 24,647.71 yuan.

The association received 16,500 yuan on behalf of the event. In addition, the association received 18,000 yuan on behalf of Jianghai Customs staff (1,500 yuan per month from January to December of the 28th year). The total amounts to 363,877.147 yuan. Moreover, the committee's solicitation of adoption work is still ongoing. A donation of 4 yuan per month is enough to adopt one refugee, and the association will provide the refugee's photo for visitation purposes.

### Chiang Pai-li's Wife Passes Away

The wife of the late General Chiang Pai-li, former president of the Army University, Madame Cha, sought refuge in Shanghai after the war. Last year, the general passed away in Yishan. Due to her advanced age and the long journey, Madame Cha was unable to attend the funeral. Overwhelmed with grief, she fell ill. Later, to recuperate, she returned to her hometown of Pushi. However, her condition worsened, and she passed away on the 6th of this month. Madame Cha had no children of her own, and the general's four daughters are all far away in Sichuan and Yunnan. Her funeral arrangements are being handled by her nephews.

### Siberian High-Pressure System Arrives, Drastic Weather Changes in This City, North Wind Howls, Sky Suddenly Turns Gloomy, Dalian and Tianjin Weather Already Turned Severe

The current weather in this city is unusually warm due to the eastward movement of the Mongolian low-pressure system, with temperatures rising above 70 degrees, resembling early summer, and light clothing is sufficient. This warm temperature persisted until yesterday morning, when a sudden and drastic change occurred. Since yesterday morning, the temperature in this city has plummeted, and a north wind is howling with a force of four or five. The cause of the drastic weather change is due to the southward and southeastward advance of a strong Siberian high-pressure system. Therefore, the climate in this city will soon become extremely cold. According to news from the Xujiahui Observatory, Dalian's climate has already been affected by the high-pressure system. Yesterday morning, the temperature dropped to 14 degrees below zero Celsius, compared to only 15 or 16 degrees a few days ago. The climate in Peiping and Tianjin is also turning cold. Yesterday morning, the temperature dropped to 3 degrees below zero. This city has been sunny and without rain for a long time, and the warm weather is abnormal. It is essential to become cold. If a small high-pressure system can develop in central China, then there is hope for rainfall in this city. Furthermore, the sky turned gloomy yesterday, a clear warning sign of the approaching extreme cold. Residents should pay attention to adjusting their clothing.

### Huahui Offender Attempts to Escape Punishment, Ultimately Arrested and Punished

The Huanghe Barber Shop on Lagenar Road (i.e., Huanghe Road) in the French Concession is owned by She Shaoquan (49 years old this year), a native of Zhenjiang. His family resides upstairs. Previously, for privately setting up a Huahui (illegal lottery) listening post, the police detained She's wife, Madame Fang (i.e., the Big Sister), and two Huahui assistants and handed them over to the Second Special District Court. As a result of the prosecution, Madame Fang was acquitted due to insufficient evidence, while the two assistants were sentenced to imprisonment and fines, respectively. On December 22nd of last year, the police arrested a woman, Zhang Wang, for participating in Huahui, who confessed that the listening post was located upstairs in the Huanghe Barber Shop. Therefore, Chinese and foreign detectives went to the address and searched the premises. She Shaoquan and Madame Fang were out and had not returned. Only a Huahui master chart was found on their daughter, Yu Hongdi (11 years old). The girl was taken to the police station and then transferred to a charitable organization for temporary care. Detectives were dispatched to apprehend She Shaoquan, but he could not be found for several days. Unexpectedly, She went to the French police station with a lawyer to report that cash and belongings had been stolen from his home during the search. The police chief sent detectives to inspect and examine the premises. The items reported as stolen were all inside the chests and had not been touched at all. After the detectives reported the information to the police chief, the lawyer was detained overnight on suspicion of aiding and abetting a false accusation and released the next day as a warning. She Shaoquan was then detained. After investigation, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning. The police prosecutor, Fei Xizhen, charged him with gathering a crowd for gambling. She was defended by lawyer Ge Zhiqin. When questioned, She continued to deny setting up a Huahui listening post. After Judge Zhu Chuzhe verified the evidence, he ruled that the case had been proven and that there was no room for denial. He then announced the judgment in court, sentencing She Shaoquan to four months of imprisonment for intending to profit and gathering a crowd for gambling, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. While the police detectives were guarding She's house, they apprehended two women, the Yu sisters, Yu Jinfeng, who had participated in Huahui. Huahui slips were found on them, and they were sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution in a separate case. They were each sentenced to a fine of ten yuan as a warning.

### Kidnapping Case of a Child, Ransom Moved to Changzhou

The case is still under investigation

Chen Dayu, a native of Zhenjiang who works as a head bather at the Tangshan Bathhouse in Xingye Lane, Tiantang Street, lives at No. 18, Lane 69, Jules Plates Road. His beloved five-year-old son, Liu Baozi, was playing in the living room of his home at 5 PM on October 24th of last year when he suddenly disappeared. Soon after, a letter demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan was received, and it was then discovered that he had been kidnapped by bandits. The case was reported to the French police, and detectives arrested two fellow villagers, Chuan Xiangtang (who works as a head bather at the Tianfa Pool Bathhouse) and Dai Shizhang (who runs a barbershop and lends money at high interest rates). However, the hostage was hidden, and there was no way to rescue him. The police sent Chuan and Dai to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention, and the hearing was postponed to a later date. These details have already been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Miao Qingbang continued the trial in the First Criminal Division. The defendants' lawyers, Ge Zhiqin, etc., also attended the court. According to the police prosecutor, Yuan Jiahwang, the police department has not yet completed the investigation of this case and requested that the hearing be postponed again. Subsequently, the detective in charge of the case reported that when the second defendant was arrested in the Great Peking Opera stage of the Wing On Company, the hostage, Liu Baozi, was sitting in the front three rows watching the opera, led by a woman, but the defendants concealed this fact, allowing their accomplices to learn of the defendants' arrest and move the hostage to Changzhou under the leadership of Shan Yi Wang Amao. Now, a letter has been received demanding a ransom of 1,000 yuan, but because that area is an occupied territory, it is impossible to go there to arrest them. The criminal behavior of the two defendants is extremely abhorrent. He requested that the case be postponed for a detailed investigation. The court verified the evidence and did not conduct an interrogation of the defendants. The defendants were then informed that the hearing would be postponed to the 23rd of this month. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Truck Driver Causes Accident, Family of Deceased Requests Compensation

Yang Zhaolian, a native of Jiangbei who works as a truck driver for the Shanghai Brewery, was driving truck number 20381 at 2:50 PM on the 8th of this month when, near the intersection of Gordon Road and Putuo Road, the driver inadvertently knocked down an eleven-year-old Shaoxing child, Shen Shanzeng. The left wheel ran over Shen's head and abdomen, causing serious injuries. The police officers number 329 of the Third Patrol and number 2494 of the Chinese Patrol arrived at the scene after hearing the report and summoned an ambulance to take him to the hospital for treatment. He died before arrival. The body was sent to the coroner's office, and the truck driver, Yang Zhaolian, was detained at the Putuo Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. The police prosecutor, Qian Xunjiu, requested detention. The family of the deceased retained lawyer Jiang Chiping to appear in court and demand compensation. The court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.

### Hooligans Commit All Kinds of Evil, Wu Zhonghua Arrested, Lives by Extorting Money from Brothels and Prostitute Houses, Arrested for Sending Invitations and Collecting Gifts

Wu Zhonghua, a native of Nanjing, nicknamed "Little Xizi," is a well-known big hooligan with considerable potential influence. He usually makes a living by extorting money. Wu extorts from all brothels, prostitute houses, escort agencies, singing girl societies, and dance halls in the area of the Old Zhabei Police Station. If his demands are not met, he resorts to terrible means. Whenever Wu extorts money from the above places, he always claims to be collecting protection fees. The establishments, fearing his potential influence, have no choice but to endure the pain and pay without daring to disobey, which makes Wu even more audacious and unscrupulous. At noon on the 6th of last month, Wu again extorted 20 yuan in protection fees from the Guangming Escort Agency, owned by Chen Guangming, at No. 6, Lane 109, Guangxi Road, but Chen refused sternly. Wu left with hatred. Chen knew that Wu would retaliate after he left, so he preemptively hired a dozen or so thugs to guard against unforeseen circumstances. As Chen expected, Wu led a large group of hooligans to Chen's establishment, leading to a confrontation with Chen's thugs. Seeing that Chen was prepared, Wu knew that he was no match and led his gang away. However, unwilling to let the matter drop, he reported a robbery at the Guangming Agency to the Old Zhabei Police Station. The police immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene, but they found no evidence of a robbery. They only found the thugs hired by Chen and arrested them, charging them under the Police Offenses Regulations and taking them to court. This shows Wu's sinister methods. Recently, the various prostitute houses, escort agencies, and dance halls in the Old Zhabei district suddenly received invitations from Wu, inviting them to a banquet at the Continental Hotel on Chaqing Road. Each invitation, in addition to specifying the date as 6:30 PM on January 8th of the 29th year, also included the words "Come help sell tickets, not too many, 10 yuan." After receiving the invitations, these establishments knew that Wu was once again extorting money under false pretenses, but they dared not disobey, so they went to deliver gifts according to the instructions on the invitations. The West Patrol Chief Fangte of the police donation class and the Chinese Third Patrol Officer No. 1013 learned of this, and realizing that there would never be peace in the district unless this person was removed, he and Chinese Detective Cui Chengke of the Chengdu Road Police Station went to arrest Wu and his gang in room 508 of the Continental Hotel the day before yesterday. However, Wu and his gang had moved to room 517. They went to that room and arrested Little Xizi and his accomplices, Xu Linfu, Xu Mingnian, and Shen Xianglai, all natives of Ningbo. 224.5 yuan in collected gifts and a gift registry were confiscated at the scene and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police prosecutor, Zhang Tianyin, explained the above circumstances, stating that Wu's various actions indicated that he must have committed many crimes and that they were currently conducting a detailed investigation, so he requested that he be temporarily detained for investigation before prosecuting. After Judge Chuan Lin interrogated them, he ordered that all four of them be returned to custody for further investigation and questioning.

### Public Bus Ticket Seller Relies on Strength to Injure Passenger

Yesterday afternoon at around 4 PM, a passenger, Mr. Jia, boarded the No. 7 public bus with registration number 15128 at Xujiahui, intending to go to Caojiadu. He paid the ticket seller, No. 481, 2 jiao in legal tender for a 1 jiao 2 fen ticket. The ticket seller gave him 8 fen in change, including a 5 fen legal tender note that was extremely tattered and difficult to use. Therefore, Mr. Jia asked him to exchange it. Unexpectedly, the ticket seller not only refused to exchange it but also insulted him. As a result, the two engaged in a verbal argument. When the bus arrived at Jing'an Temple, the ticket seller used the iron tool for opening the bus door to strike Mr. Jia in the face, causing blood to flow profusely. This aroused public outrage from the other passengers, who all blamed the ticket seller. The ticket seller's attitude was stubborn and unreasonable. Fortunately, the police officer on duty nearby heard the commotion and brought the passenger and the ticket seller to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for interrogation.

### Gambling House Employee Kidnapped

According to Huawen News Agency, at around 4 PM yesterday, eight burly men, each carrying a Mauser pistol, broke into the accounting room of the Fusheng Company gambling house in the Dingye Lane of the Caojiadu Wujiaochang, and kidnapped one of the employees. According to investigations by reporters, the employee's name is Zhu Pinfang, a native of Danyang, 32 years old, who runs the Zhulongtai Noodle Shop in Caojiadu. Zhu is responsible for accounting at the gambling house. The reason for Zhu's arrest is unknown.

### All Clerical Staff of the Second Special District Court Petition for Salary Increase Again

Approximately several dozen clerical staff members of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court, formerly petitioned the authorities jointly, on the grounds that their positions were humble and their salaries were low, making it impossible to make a living, requesting the authorities to take into account their situation and appropriately increase their salaries in order to maintain the status quo. Subsequently, President Chen Mao-hsien of the court reported the situation to the High Third Branch Court. After the High Court telegraphed the Ministry of Judicial Administration for review and processing, three months passed without receiving a reply from the Ministry of Law. Moreover, living costs are increasing daily without end, leading to impatience among the clerical staff. Therefore, yesterday, they all petitioned the authorities again. It is reported that Yang Pengyun, president of the High Third Branch Court, has telegraphed the Ministry of Law again to urge a decision, and a satisfactory resolution is expected in the coming days.

### Li Wenyuan's Troops Annihilate a Large Group of Japanese and Puppet Troops

Li Wenyuan's Fourth Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army was originally stationed in Sanzao Town, Nanhui. In September of last year, Li's troops were transferred to Fengxian County, leaving only a small number of troops stationed in Sanzao. Unexpectedly, Chen Wanghe's puppet troops from Zhuqiao Town invaded and occupied the area. In early December, Li transported a mortar from the 45th Brigade in Zha Pu and sent troops back to Sanzao to fiercely attack the puppet troops. After a stalemate until the beginning of this month, Li's troops repeatedly swept through the area, and the puppet troops finally retreated completely. During several months of fighting, Li Wenyuan's troops killed over 200 Japanese and puppet troops, but his Second Battalion, led by Wu Zhenhai, also suffered losses of over 100 men. The local people greatly support Li because he is a former officer of the 45th Brigade, fighting courageously and independently to defend the area.

### Scoundrels Eat for Free, Stab Restaurant Worker to Death, Hooligans Use Ruthless Means, Two Criminals Arrested Pending Investigation

Scoundrels such as Xue Jingeng (nicknamed Xiao Danyang, also known as Shisandian), Xiao Changzhou, Xiao Sanbao, Qiangbi Laitou, Xiao Nanjing, Zhang Xueheng, and others, who make a living by extorting and stealing from boatmen near the Suzhou Creek wharf on North Shanxi Road, went to the Dongsheng Restaurant at No. 18 North Shanxi Road on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. After eating their fill, they escaped without paying. The next afternoon, Xue Jingeng went to the restaurant again to eat. Fu Abing (30 years old), a native of Wuxi who worked at the restaurant, and his colleague, Zhang Quanfu, confronted him, leading to a dispute and a mutual brawl. They were taken to the police station. As the matter was trivial, the police chief released Xue after scolding him. Later, while Zhang was delivering food to No. 19, Lane 251 of the same road, he passed the Suzhou Creek wharf and was dragged onto a boat by a gang of scoundrels. They claimed that they had been wrongly accused of eating for free when they dined at the restaurant, which had made them lose face, and they took out knives and iron bars to threaten him. Zhang was quick-witted and apologized, allowing him to escape. At 1:45 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, Fu Abing, who worked at the restaurant, had to go out. While passing the North Suzhou Road wharf, he was spotted by the scoundrels, who rushed forward, surrounded him, and beat him to the ground with iron bars. As a result, Xiao Nanjing and Zhang Xueheng pulled out a triangular dagger and stabbed Fu in the back before fleeing. A Chinese police officer on guard nearby saw Fu Abing lying in a pool of blood, barely alive, and immediately telephoned the police station and summoned an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital. He died after failing to respond to medical treatment. The body was taken to the Jiaozhou Road coroner's office. At 6 PM that afternoon, Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Zhu Mengwei, and Detective Xu Huanqing of the Huishi Police Station found and arrested Xiao Nanjing and Zhang Xueheng at the wharf and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police prosecutor, Qian Xunjiu, explained the case and requested detention. After Judge Huang Risheng questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be returned to custody pending verification of Fu's body.

### Letter

To the Editor, We are writing on behalf of our client, the manager of Baotai Pawnshop, who stated that the news published in the local section of the Shen Bao on the 9th of this month regarding the pawnshop fire and the pawnbroker's request for compensation, which stated that the fire was caused by carelessness and burned a corner of the building, is not true. According to the French Concession police who investigated the case, the fire at our pawnshop was definitely not caused by our negligence. Furthermore, more than just a corner of the building was destroyed; all of the pawned goods were lost, and the insurance compensation was not even enough to cover the principal of the loans. Since our pawnshop was not at fault, we are not responsible for compensation. This case should be resolved by the court, but the inaccurate report may cause misunderstandings. We request that you correct the record accordingly. Sincerely, Lawyer Wang Hengyi, January 9th

### Finance, Hong Kong Banks Switch from Selling to Buying, Foreign Exchange Fluctuates Tightly

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The off-exchange rates for British and American currencies, after several days of volatility, gradually calmed down despite persistent rumors and entered a fluctuating state. This was because most speculators were hesitant and dared not take action. The market situation was slightly loose in the morning, but turned tight in the afternoon, eventually closing lower by 0.02125 points, mainly due to Hong Kong Telecom ceasing sales and instead buying. At noon, there were rumors that the Japanese military was demanding the resignation of the cabinet, so even though importers were buying, supply still fell short of demand.

In the morning, the exchange rate between the US and Britain increased by 0.275 points, leading to a stable pound and a loose dollar at the opening. Subsequently, Chinese banks and speculators started selling, and soon Hong Kong Telecom also sold, causing the market to become tight. By 9:30, British gold reached 5 pence and the US dollar reached 8.1875 yuan. Later, foreign firms settled payments for cotton and wheat, and Shanghai Chinese banks also took advantage of the low prices to buy spot US dollars, causing the market to stabilize. At 9:45, British gold returned to 4.90625 pence and the US dollar retreated to 8.0625 yuan. Later, the Jewish merchant George Joe straightaway closed his long positions, causing the market to loosen again.

In the afternoon, yarn and flower merchants suddenly became interested in buying, and Jardine Matheson also came to acquire, plus Hong Kong Telecom switched from selling to buying and vigorously bought February US dollars, so the market turned tight, and until the evening close, it closed at 4.875 pence and 8 yuan tight.

Gold Market Hesitates

Yesterday's cash gold black market also fluctuated due to the unstable foreign exchange market, rising and falling from time to time. However, as a result, the foreign exchange market slightly tightened, but the gold price fell by 2 yuan, which was due to the news of the Japanese military demanding the resignation of the cabinet and a certain gold firm continuing to sell. The morning opening was at a low price of 4050 yuan, down 32 yuan, because the foreign exchange was loose, and buyers temporarily watched. However, after hearing that the foreign exchange market had tightened, a certain money exchange industry saw securities firms buying in one after another, and Hong Kong firms were also active, so it rebounded by 40 yuan. But unexpectedly, the foreign exchange market softened again, coupled with a gold firm vigorously selling more than 500 taels, so it also fell by 32 yuan. Soon the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened again, and money exchange firms and securities firms came to buy again, rising again by 28 yuan. However, by the noon close, due to the foreign exchange market hardening further and a certain gold firm selling vigorously again, it was only 4073 yuan. The afternoon opening was down 13 yuan due to negative news. Fortunately, the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened, and people were inevitably encouraged. A certain gold firm and a certain bank came to buy, and the market stabilized, once again rising to a high of 4090 yuan.

Shortly after, the foreign exchange market suddenly reported tightening, and a certain money exchange industry first shouted to buy. Soon, a certain money exchange firm and a securities firm also came to buy, and a certain bank commissioned by a Hong Kong firm also bought, so it jumped up by 40 yuan in an instant. A certain bank entered 20 taels from the gold firm, for 4090 yuan. At this time, a certain money exchange industry suddenly took profits and sold, immediately falling to 4075 yuan.

### Securities, Domestic and Foreign Bonds Rise Simultaneously, Foreign Stock Market Declines After Peak, Chinese Electric Stock Has Only Buyers and No Sellers

Yesterday's securities black market continued to be very strong, and people were still firm. At first, everyone felt that it might fluctuate, but then they heard that the Japanese cabinet was turbulent and the foreign exchange market was softening again. The bulls still dominated, with few sellers and many short covering. In the morning, Class C bonds reached the 50 yuan mark again. In the afternoon, due to news of the unstable Japanese cabinet, the market price became more lively again. A peaceful atmosphere constantly circulated in the market. The need gradually expanded, and Class C bonds were one of the most benefited, and also the most active. Therefore, its trading volume was particularly high, and its price had implicitly become the standard for various bonds. The future is still easier to rise than to fall. Yesterday morning, Da Kang Cheng, Run Li, and Tong Kang bought a lot, either to cover shorts or to open new positions, which was very lively. Ju Xin and Tian Sheng also had needs. However, many bulls closed their positions and short selling was very active, so Class C bonds failed to break through 50 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, Da Kang Cheng still had strong demand, and Da Feng, Jiu Feng, Jiu Fu, Lian He, and others absorbed them, and Class C bonds broke through the 50 yuan mark again. As a result, the market price continued to rise by 0.4 to 0.55 yuan. The total turnover was 1 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing, Compared to Previous Day

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Association saw both industrial and rubber stocks turn weak. Most prices were much lower than the previous day. The market opened in the afternoon and was covered by selling pressure again. Afterwards, it gradually recovered. Some buyers who were waiting for the opportunity saw that the prices had fallen to a low level, and silently bought at low prices. At the close, rubber stocks were especially in demand.

London, 8th Telegram, Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds suddenly rose. The Reorganization Loan (British Issue) rose sharply by £3, to a price of £40. The Crisp Loan rose by £2.5, to a price of £28. The Anglo-German Loan Continuation (British Issue) rose by £2, to a price of £58. The Sino-French US Dollar Loan (with stamp) rose by £1, to a price of £49. The Vickers Aircraft Loan fell by £3, to a price of £10. The Canton-Kowloon Railway also fell by £1, to a price of £16. The rest were flat.

London, 8th Telegram, Today, the listed prices of stocks of British Far Eastern companies continued to rise. The HSBC stock rose by 0.5 pounds each, with the London registered stock at £85 and the Hong Kong registered stock at £87. The Chartered Bank stock rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to a price of £11 and 15 shillings. The Kailan Mining Administration stock rose by 6 pence, to 18 shillings. The rest were flat.

### Grain, Rice Market Still Firm, Foreign Rice Prices Difficult to Lower, High-Quality Japonica Rice Still Has Price Limits

Yesterday, no supplies came from South Port, while more than ten carts of Green Corner thin rice arrived, totaling more than 500 bags. After arriving in Hongkou, the transportation to the Concession became a problem again. Intercepting rice and grain, making it difficult for people in the Concession to obtain food, remained a consistent practice. No samples of original package foreign rice were available on the market. Only recycled goods were traded privately, and brokers took the opportunity to pull up prices, creating a commotion. All goods showed a rising trend. For example, No. 1 Saigon was shouted to 37 yuan, No. 2 Saigon also reached 35.5 yuan, broken rice was nearly 33 yuan, and rice bran was around 30 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan compared to before. Japonica rice, early rice, late rice, and other types also followed suit. Fortunately, there were abundant stocks, and unscrupulous merchants still had concerns despite manipulating prices. Moreover, buyers saw that the prices seemed to have risen enough and no longer bought more. By the close, the market had actually risen by only about 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Except for the Changbai Japonica rice, which remained at 40 yuan, the remaining Su Tong Japonica rice ranged from 29 yuan to 37.5 yuan, South Port early and late rice ranged from 36.7 to 36.8 yuan, Qing Si Special Thin rice was around 38 yuan, Saigon No. 1 ranged from 36.7 to 36.5 yuan, No. 2 ranged from 35.4 to 34.8 yuan, and broken rice ranged from 32.5 to 32 yuan. Glutinous rice still had limited sales, and the market did not rise or fall much, only tightening slightly.

Although some foreign rice continued to arrive in small quantities, foreign prices continued to rise. It was difficult to sell No. 1 Saigon at 46 or 47 yuan, and even broken rice prices were high. As a result, new transactions remained sluggish. Recycled original packages were also unwilling to be sold easily with the market. Yesterday, it was reported that Japan had ordered one million tons from Siam, and the market sentiment became even more agitated. In addition, there were problems with the Hongkou foreign warehouses picking up goods, and trading houses took the opportunity to raise prices, increasing selling prices by 5, 6, or 7 cents. No. 1 Saigon opened at 36.8 yuan, and broken rice was at 32.5 yuan. The early market was still looking good, but the market had eased, and with the impact of the gold market declining and the Japanese cabinet turmoil, the afternoon market returned to flat.

### Flour Soars, Reaching 9.40 Yuan

Flour, yesterday's price from the No. 2 Flour Mill soared by 4 cents, reaching 9.40 yuan. This was because the demand from local customers had been good recently, and they were buying New Year's goods. Various factories, due to high wheat prices and large costs, repeatedly restricted supply, so that both buyers and sellers had not been fully satisfied for days. After the factory prices increased by 4 cents yesterday, the local retail market could be fully supplied, but customers were restricted because the factory prices had already risen by 4 cents, so Lüpao and Chelaoche were not opened. The Bingship and Tianzhu brands were sold for 9.70 yuan, and about 10,000 bags were bought by the North and South ports. Local sales were also more than 10,000 bags, and the market was quite lively. The prices of Japanese flour on the market also rose. The January Phoenix brand initially opened at 9.35 yuan, then reached 9.50 yuan, and the February price was 9.78 yuan. Moreover, 2,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin today, and another 1,000 bags were shipped to Hong Kong.

Wheat, yesterday's supply was still sporadic, and the market's inventory was not abundant. Japanese factories were keen to buy, and secretly raised prices to buy, causing the sellers to be even more reluctant to sell. It was rumored that various flour mills had ordered foreign wheat, with rumors that three or four ships had been confirmed. According to reliable sources from the factories, only the Fufeng Factory had confirmed one ship. Although other factories had been in contact, they had not been finalized due to a lack of ship positions. Therefore, the selling price of local wheat, with the flour market's factory prices rising sharply, inevitably became higher and higher, reaching 16 yuan. Even secondary goods had to be 15.78 yuan, and the market was in a state of hoarding again. The market was supplied by the factory buying 2,000 to 3,000 bags, and trading houses pulled in 3 or 4 carts, all of which were traded secretly.

### Oil Market, Incoming Goods Reported Seized, Soybean Oil Rises Two Yuan Immediately, Vegetable Oil First Flat Then Down -

Yesterday's soybean oil market, due to the sudden news that Dalian crude oil (totaling more than 1,400 barrels) was seized by the Japanese military, caused people's hearts to tighten again, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, and the market immediately rose by 2 yuan. The details were as follows: Qingdao oil, 200 barrels, priced at 102 yuan; Jiangbei oil, 200 barrels, also priced at 102 yuan; Changzhou factory oil, 100 barrels, priced at 102 yuan; Da You factory oil, 300 dan, priced at 82 yuan; Yanqi oil, 100 pieces, priced at 77 yuan. Vegetable oil was first flat and then fell, with the total market trading of Jiangbei canned oil 3,400 cans, priced at 98 or 99 yuan, which was distributed by the local market and Hong Kong firms.

Yesterday, 380 pieces of soybean oil came from Qingdao, and 800 cans of vegetable oil and 450 bags of raw peanuts also came.

### Yarn and Flower, Yarn Market Has Reached the End of Its Strength

The yarn market continued to be weak, and the trend was very weak. This was because customer sales were sluggish, and the peaceful atmosphere was dense, and the exchange rate continued to rise, so general spot goods were quite uneasy given the former situation, and the market was not prosperous. However, big firms like Moufeng still continued to pull up prices when prices fell, so market prices still rose and fell from time to time. But in general, it was feared that it had reached the end of its strength, and in fact, the sales were too clear, and the chips were increasing day by day.

The opening price of spot yarn in the morning continued the weak trend of the previous day, and there were many sellers in the market. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 720 yuan, and it fell to 717 yuan in an instant. Later, after Moumou and others suddenly bought in 200 bales of futures in January and February, they maintained confidence and slowly recovered to 725 yuan, but the foreign exchange rate was still rising. According to the statistics of the turnover in half a day, 1,640 bales were traded, the price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 4.5 yuan, Tiannv fell by 3 yuan, and Shuangdiqiu fell by 6 yuan. Today, 165 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 16 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 68 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. The amount sold by each firm is listed separately below:

Same industry 1,540 Hong Kong 35

Tianjin 50 Mainland 15

Total 1,640

### Qingdao Merchants Purchasing Raw Cotton, This Year's Cotton Firms Made Huge Profits

The trading of local cotton was still not weak, but it was rarer than the previous day. It was heard that Qingdao continued to have needs, and the trend was still on the horizontal line, so people were still optimistic. However, since the yarn market had no sales and the factory's inventory was increasing day by day, there was no great intention to purchase raw materials. The overseas Indian and American cotton markets remained firm, and the holders were tight and did not give up. Moreover, the huge profits of this year's cotton firms were quite surprising. Therefore, there was no such thing as absorbing inventory in their minds. As a result, it was difficult for the market to fall. However, supplies from Northern Jiangsu continued to arrive, and the goods arriving at the docks were: Tonghua 1,567 bales, Changyinsha 1,591 bales, and Beisha 840 bales. The current situation of spot cotton is listed on the left:

Taicang Flower 168.00 Tonghang enter 700 bales

Taicang Flower 175.00 Tongyi enter 1,000 bales

Tongzhou packing 176.00 Tonghang enter 200 pieces

Chongtong 163.00 Also 200 bales

Dazhongji 218.50 Xinyu 250 pieces

Huocaobao 168.00 Neiwai 700 bales

Tongzhou 174.00 Tonghang 100 bales

Huojicao 162.75 Also 115 bales

Also 163.00 Also 160 bales

Xia Sha American seed 183.80 Also 84 bales

Another news, the market price of foreign cotton: New York cotton market, initially fell due to public selling, and then improved due to the purchase of the same industry and the covering of some shorts. As a result, the closing market was very firm, and its price rose compared to the previous day, rising by 3 or 4 pounds. The Indian cotton market, including forecasts, rose by more than 4 rupees, Egypt rose by more than 30 pounds, and Liverpool rose by 7 or 8 pence.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was very quiet. All parties believed that the exchange rate was suddenly loose and the yarn price had fallen miserably, so the factory's purchase of raw cotton was very weak. The same was true among the industry. Japanese factories also had no large amount of trading. The price of the cotton market yesterday, converted to the factory price with the US dollar at 8 yuan, is recorded as follows:

20 Count, American Middling 230.50

20 Count, American Middling Low Grade 216.00

32 Count, American Middling 239.20

32 Count, American Middling Low Grade 230.00

42 Count, American Middling 242.00

42 Count, American Middling Low Grade 233.00

### Sugar Market, Coarse White Sugar Continues to Fall

Yesterday's foreign sugar fell again due to the rising exchange rate. The association's listed price saw coarse white sugar fell by 0.5 to 1 yuan. The spot price of 24 Coarse White Sugar was 57.5 yuan at Ben Stack, 57.9 yuan for the new arrival at Wai Stack, and 56.8 yuan for the old stock. Re-exported sugar was 46 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Mark Car Stack was 58.5 yuan, West Stack was 59 yuan, CW Mark was 58.7 yuan, CX Mark was 58.5 yuan, DY Mark was 58 yuan, HX Mark was 57.5 yuan, H Mark Car Red was 43.5 yuan to 43 yuan, Dutch Red was 45.5 yuan to 45 yuan. The domestic No. 1 White was 57.5 yuan, No. 1 Ice was 67.5 yuan, and Jingming Ice was 69 yuan. According to the telegram from Gu Yu, Jian Bang, the domestic sugar had a rumor of export ban, so the asking price rose by another yuan, but no transactions were seen. The Guangdong firm opened 114 boxes of colored secondary brick green, priced at 27.5 yuan. High-quality sliced green in small boxes was called for 44 yuan, and bagged was 43 yuan, but no transactions were made. There were imports from Zhangjiakou and 250 bags of Car White from Hong Kong, and 1,190 bags from Xiamen.

### Dried and Fresh Goods, Shortage of Dried Lychee and Dried Longan

Dried lychee and dried longan were still in short supply. According to yesterday's statistics, only 131 boxes of dried lychee and only 5 boxes of dried longan arrived, so the market remained tight and there was hope for a continued rise.

Social Survey

### People's Livelihood Simple Cafeteria

— A Refugee

The People's Livelihood Simple Cafeteria was established by the late philanthropist Mr. Wang Yiting, in conjunction with enthusiastic charitable celebrities in the city, who raised funds to create it. At that time, Mr. Wang, recognizing the hardship of the poor and the increasing economic burden, especially for the laboring masses and the homeless, impoverished single men from other provinces in Shanghai, who felt the pain of economic distress and often struggled to have enough to eat, established this cafeteria in places like Lujiabang and Tangjiawan in the Nanshi area to meet the needs of the poor. They utilized the vacant space after the market stalls closed, using ropes to enclose a corner of the market, placing long tables and benches for the poor to eat on the spot. The prices were economical, cheaper than ordinary restaurants, and cleaner than roadside food stalls. At that time, the selling price was ten copper coins for each lead can of white rice, which was equivalent to two bowls of rice in a restaurant; one small piece of red and white fermented bean curd (one-quarter of a whole piece) cost one copper coin; a bowl of broad bean pickled vegetable soup cost five or six copper coins. Those with small appetites could get full for four or five cents. Because the selling price was aimed at being affordable for the common people, the People's Livelihood Cafeteria suffered monthly losses at that time, entirely supported by the founders and philanthropists, benefiting the poor, which was no small feat! Now, with soaring prices, it is extremely difficult to eat a meal, and it costs no less than twenty or thirty cents to eat rice. If Mr. Wang were still alive, he would definitely have facilities to provide emergency assistance to the poor. Writing this makes people feel grateful!

After the outbreak of the "August 13th" battle, the Cilian Association established many reception centers to accommodate homeless refugees. By November of the 26th year, the relief supplies were handled by the First Mountain International Relief Committee, which used vehicles to deliver self-cooked meals to each reception center; later, due to the occasional shortage of fuel and the frequent relocation of reception center buildings, some centers lacked places to build stoves, and a few centers that cooked their own meals wasted food and fuel. After calculating the costs, the committee decided to have the People's Livelihood Cafeteria cook the meals on their behalf, which was more economical. Therefore, the food supplies sent by the international community were handed over to the cafeteria to cook on their behalf, twice a day, at noon and in the evening, using the cafeteria's own trucks to deliver the meals to the centers. By the winter of the 27th year, the International Association stopped providing relief supplies, and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association took over the task of supplying food, calculating the price of the supplies needed per person per month, combined with legal tender, and handing the money over to the Cilian Association for its own distribution based on the number of people in the reception centers. Then, the association purchased rice and signed a contract with the People's Livelihood Cafeteria to cook the meals on their behalf; based on one hundred catties of rice per meal, they would subsidize the cost of fuel and labor, with the cafeteria responsible for cooking meals for all the reception centers affiliated with the Cilian Association, and stipulating that every one hundred catties of rice should be cooked into two hundred and twenty catties of cooked rice, responsible for cooking and distributing the meals to the centers.

In the past, this cafeteria did indeed serve the poor with convenience, so much so that it suffered monthly losses but still tried its best to maintain operations; since cooking meals for refugees on behalf of others, its business has flourished, and it has now become a commercialized business, which is a big change from its original intention when it was founded. According to estimates, every one hundred catties of rice can be cooked into two hundred and seventy catties of cooked rice, and at the very least, it can be cooked into two hundred and fifty catties, thus gaining a profit of thirty to fifty catties of hot rice. Recently, the rice eaten by refugees in various centers has been quite coarse, with reddish and mottled grains, and mixed with other grains. When eating, it catches in the throat and is difficult to swallow, which the refugees find very painful. It is said that when the association purchased this rice, it cost thirty-six yuan per dan (unit of weight), so it shouldn't have so many impurities. As for putting the rice in the pot without washing it and boiling the vegetables without cleaning them, and pouring unheated oil on top of the soup, one can only adopt the principle of "what the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve" and swallow it down. Therefore, I specifically wrote this for publication in the journal, hoping that the cafeteria will pay attention to improving its hygiene and cleanliness, and I also ask enthusiastic philanthropists to supervise them, so that they can truly achieve the goal of benefiting the refugees and avoid being exploited by merchants, creating opportunities for them to make profits. Then, the refugees will truly receive the benefits, and it will be more than just saving countless lives!

### Applying to the Women's Education Center

— Qixun

In the current social state where the sources of livelihood are gradually drying up, the pursuit and grabbing of a "rice bowl" has reached a point of sharpness that makes people shudder. Whenever an organization publicly seeks talent from society, regardless of how good or bad the待遇 (dàiyù, treatment, pay, benefits) are, a wonderful "rice bowl scramble" will always be staged.

When I received the news that the Shanghai Women's Education Center on Hualong Road was recruiting clerks, my heart surged with indescribable excitement; but after reading the regulations, those who are hired must undergo a five-month trial period before being officially hired, and there is no salary during the trial period. I thought about my own circumstances, how could I survive for five months? My fiery heart cooled down by half. In the end, I still took a chance with the attitude of "it's better than nothing," and finally paid the two yuan registration fee and submitted my credentials, anxiously awaiting their verdict on my life's fate.

The facts before me taught me: one cannot be too ambitious. Although the treatment is meager, and one only gets to eat and get a salary after five months; however, the people who applied filled three of the largest classrooms. Counting fifty people per room, there were one hundred and fifty young men and women. Everyone's face was filled with a kind of hope, as if they had found a source of water in the desert. That uplifting spirit fully covered up the sadness of unemployment.

The bell rang, and the proctor entered the classroom. The first item was abacus calculation. Although the questions were not difficult, no one completed them completely, because within fifty minutes, one had to calculate the percentage of students attending each subject in a school; reconcile the total revenue and expenditure for a semester; calculate the selling price, quantity, and actual value of books sold in a semester; estimating the amount, it was equivalent to three-tenths of an account book in a store. Due to the lack of time, the majority of people submitted blank papers, and all said in unison, "I'm afraid even the most famous accountants don't have such rapid skills."

Next, the general knowledge test was truly unexpected. The first question was: "Which brand of light bulb is the best?" It was as if they were recruiting employees for a light bulb company, and all the history, geography, social studies, science, and education knowledge that I had prepared for half a day was wasted. Next, they asked for the telephone numbers of the two concession fire departments and police stations, and how much the water bill was per unit? Although the questions were not difficult, nine out of ten people couldn't answer them. Regarding this, those who rely on applying for jobs cannot ignore this, and cannot just be "living people reading dead books" and finding answers in books, so I wrote it out for reference.

After the "calligraphy" test, the first test ended. At one o'clock in the afternoon, the list was posted. Out of one hundred and fifty people, only thirty were qualified to participate in the second test, and out of these thirty people, twenty-six more would be eliminated. In reality, only four people were hired, which was equivalent to one hundred and fifty people jointly搶奪 (qiǎngduó, scramble for, seize by force) these four "rice bowls" that required five months of obligatory service. My heart, and my fiery hope, had dropped from boiling point to freezing point. However, my sadness was not for this one "failure," but for the seriousness of the entire unemployment problem, making it extremely difficult for the unemployed to find a glimmer of hope.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Admiring the Moon to Establish a Family, Planting Jade and Nurturing Pearls with Skillful Pregnancy

Tang Huizhen said: "I think this artificial insemination method should be prohibited by the state. It is a method that destroys ethics. In the future, if everyone only knows their mother and not their father, it will be a major change in ethics. The reason why humans are different from ordinary animals is because they have fixed partners. With fixed partners, there are relatives, families, and all social organizations. All animals, when they are born, only know their mother and not their father, and when they grow up, they don't even know their mother anymore. If artificial insemination becomes popular, I'm afraid that humans will gradually return to the beginning of ancient times and be no different from birds and beasts." Zhu Airen said: "She stays in the rural towns all day, busy with trivial matters, and doesn't ask about foreign affairs. She even reads very few of the newly published medical magazines from Europe and the United States. I don't know how advanced their artificial insemination methods have become." Tang Huizhen said: "Now it's just an experimental era, but those scientists, once they invent something, will definitely succeed. Once they succeed, there will naturally be curious people, or people who are sexually incompetent, who will go to ask these doctors. At the moment, it can be considered not to exceed the scope too much. For example, a couple wants children very much, but they can't conceive. So they go to ask a doctor why they can't conceive. After investigating the reason, it may be that the uterus is crooked, or the male and female reproductive organs cannot match, or there is some other reason. At that time, with the doctor's surgery, the husband's sperm can be transferred to the wife. This way, the husband and wife are still husband and wife, and the father and son are still father and son, and it does not conflict with ethics, law, or morality. It's just that the doctor is used as a messenger in the middle. But I'm afraid that in the future, this artificial insemination method will go beyond the scope of husband and wife. Recently, there was an incident that one of the foreign doctors in our hospital told me. He said: In a certain place in America, there was a woman whose husband died three years ago. She had a very rich inheritance, but no children. She really wanted to have a son. Then you can just marry another husband. If you marry another husband, you can have children. But she didn't want to have another husband. Perhaps her husband had caused her a bit of trouble when he was alive. Someone said: If you want a son, just adopt one from someone else. In today's laws, adopted sons and daughters are the same. But she didn't want to adopt someone else's son either. She had to have one that she gave birth to herself. So one day, she ran to a doctor and asked him to examine her body. She asked: With a body like mine, can I have a child? The doctor saw that she was very young, not yet thirty years old. Her body was also very healthy, and after examining all the reproductive organs, there was nothing wrong with them at all. The doctor assured her that if the man on the other side did not have any deficiencies in reproductive function, he would definitely be able to conceive." (225)

### A Word to the Boss

— Lin

The weather is getting colder day by day, and students in our civilian night school in the textile district often absent themselves without reason. The people in charge of the school are very uneasy about this. Could it be that the students are letting down the teachers' sincerity and wasting the school's money because of the cold weather? This forced the Dean of Students to investigate. However, the results of the investigation were unexpected. According to one student, "The day before yesterday, the boss told me to deliver something to his relatives' house. Yesterday, I wanted to come, but a guest came, and I had to serve tea and light cigarettes for him. After I did all these things, I was just about to come to school, but the boss said to me: 'The accounts haven't been settled yet today, you shouldn't go to class.' So I didn't come."

Most of the students in our school are apprentices. Perhaps the frequent absences of students in the past few days are due to the weather, but I believe that the reason for many students' absences is the same as the one mentioned by the student above. These apprentices have to work during the day, and they take one or two hours of their time at night to study. However, there are still many bosses who are unwilling to let their apprentices have time for education and still want them to do trivial things. Since they have allowed them to register, why entangle them with trivial matters and prevent them from coming to class? According to the regulations of the International Labor Organization, workers must have eight hours of education, eight hours of rest, and eight hours of work. However, many bosses do not even allow their apprentices to have two hours of education. Isn't that a bit too cruel? For this matter, we appeal to the many bosses not to let trivial matters deprive apprentices of their time for study during the hours of 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM every day, so that they can gain some knowledge in the very rare opportunity they have.

### 1940: Hollywood's New Predictions

— Qing

Hollywood's prophet Motisse always makes a shocking prediction at the beginning of each year. Last year, most of what he said came true. This year, he made a general prediction as follows:

If Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" is released this year, it will definitely be ill-fated, and may not even be released in several places in the United States. His new work "Chaplin No. 6" is his last work, and he will permanently retire from the film industry afterward.

Anna May Wong will have two white men propose to her this year, but neither will succeed. She will not be able to get married until next year, and she will marry a wealthy man of her own race.

"Oomph" girl Ann Sheridan will get married this year, but will not retire from the silver screen. She must star in four more films before happily enjoying family life.

Joan Crawford will have another romance this year, but it will not be a reconciliation with her ex-husband, nor with her new lover, Charlie Martin, but a love affair with someone outside the industry.

Katharine Hepburn's situation in Hollywood this year is not good. Box office sales plummeted, and later no one cared about her, and she could not establish herself in the United States.

The following male stars will become extremely popular: (1) James Stewart, (2) Henry Fonda, (3) Cary Grant.

Tyrone Power and Annabella's relationship will break down at one point, but they will soon reconcile.

Myrna Loy and Judy Garland are particularly good friends, from friendship to love, and even from passionate love to wanting to get married, but it is not allowed due to their age.

### Lu Ming Sets Off for Hong Kong Tomorrow Afternoon

— Hua

Chen Kengran and Xu Qin芳 (Qinfang) Travel Together - Returns after Five Months of Filming in Southern Guangdong

(Special Report from This Newspaper) This newspaper briefly reported on May 5th that Lu Ming was going to Hong Kong to make movies. Now, as the departure is imminent, he is scheduled to depart tomorrow afternoon (11th) aboard the Chisha Danny. Therefore, the details are reported to the readers:

Lu Ming's negotiation with Nanyue was finalized last year when Zhu Qingxian returned to Shanghai. However, at that time, Chen Kengran also wanted to make his own movies, and the first film, "The Sad History of Liang Zhu," was also prepared and ready to be filmed at the Hualian Studio. Unexpectedly, the Guohua Company had announced it beforehand, and Zhang Shichuan raised objections to Chen. Later, an intermediary mediated, and he gave up his original plan. Therefore, Lu Ming was originally going to depart in early spring, but now, due to the postponement of "The Sad History of Liang Zhu," he is leaving early.

Lu Ming's contract with Nanyue is for two movies, with very favorable terms, similar to how Xinhua invited Chen Yun裳 (Yunshang) to Shanghai. All travel expenses, food, and lodging are provided by the company. It is expected that the two movies will be completed in five months.

Both movies are of course period dramas. One is probably "Killing the Family of Fishermen." Chen Kengran had proposed this to Yihua. It is a ready-made script, and he can start working on it as soon as he arrives in Hong Kong. The other one has not been decided yet, so the Kengran couple has been busy running between the Commercial Press and the Zhonghua Bookstore these past two days, buying a large number of books, preparing to decide on the second movie while on the ship. Both of these movies will be released in Shanghai. Re-mentioning the old story of "Killing the Family of Fishermen" is precisely to capture more Hong Kong outdoor scenes and give the audience a fresh perspective.

In addition, Yuan Meiyun is also traveling with them. It is said that Yuan Meiyun's trip is for sightseeing, but in fact, Wang Yin is filming "Chen Yuanyuan" in Hong Kong, so she is going to visit her daughter.

### Feng She's New Year Test of Hearts

— Tianfang

The members of Feng She held their second dress rehearsal on the 2nd at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association. I also went to watch on time. I immediately saw a notice posted on the right side of the door, only to learn that this rehearsal, although for ordinary New Year's entertainment, was actually a charity event for disaster relief. The members of the society, in view of the fact that the flower baskets donated by friends at the last performance were numerous and wasteful, proposed by Wang Xiaoshui, Shen Yongliang, Ma Luchu, Cao Maoru, and Sun Beiping, that friends who come to support this time should all donate cash instead of flower baskets to charity organizations, to bring blessings to friends. As a result, the price of the flower baskets reached a huge sum of five thousand six hundred and four yuan. The entire amount was donated to Pushan Villa, designated for the distribution of coffins. Immediately entering the theater, Ma Luchu's (Ma Luchu) "Adding an Official" had already been skipped. Cao Maoru was singing "Bao Zheng's Beating the Imperial Robes" in a flowing manner, with a loud voice, round and precise tones, which was much improved from the previous time. "Baimenlou," "Qing Dingzhu," and "Wulongyuan" were not seen. "Lianhuan Tao" had too many people, so I could only close my eyes and listen in the backstage. When I heard the sentence "more than twelve feet from head to tail," I realized that my friend Mr. Rui Lin's Huang Tianba was an old hobbyist. His opening was different from others, and the allegro was also calm and pleasant to listen to. Sun Yixiang's Bao Liandun's recitative was also loud and vigorous. Nanyang Kan was performed by an eight-year-old child. His singing, acting, and fighting were without major flaws. The final performance was Yu Yiyun's "Hongluan Xi Dai" (Happy Reunion), with Yu Jiabin, Xue Zhuorong, and Qi Daan assisting. Miss Yu's makeup was fuller than what I had seen before, and her movements were unhurried, and her skills were commendably advancing. Jiabin's Mo Ji, Xue Zhuorong's Jin Song, and Qi Daan's Lin Daren all acted with great enthusiasm. I initially suspected that Xue's Jin Song was an insider, but later I learned that Mr. Xue was originally an old Peking hobbyist, and his skills were very admirable. Unfortunately, due to prolonged illness and fatigue in the evening performance, Wang and Shen's "Zhu Zhai" could not be heard, which was a pity.

### General Review of Northern Female Performers (Part 2)

— Shao

Second-Tier Female Performers

There are several noteworthy figures among the second-tier female performers in the North. Hou Yulan is willing to depend on others (to be a "sword holder" for Xi Xiaobo) and does not want to establish her own troupe, which shows that her insight is above that of the average person. Yulan's art is progressing rapidly and is close to the mainstream. Many top-tier female performers cannot compare to her. Hu Bilian is a middle-aged woman who has returned to her old profession. Her style is still the same as before. In terms of qualifications and experience, she is also valuable. Unfortunately, her voice is no longer as pleasant as it used to be. Ma Yanfen is one of the best of the "Three Beauties of the Ma Family." Her acting is conservative and can be described as rare. Hu Juqin used to follow Yan Jupeng and then supported Tan Fuying. Her art is not as good as Hou and Hu, but she is still a middle-class talent. Ms. Tao Moc厂 (Mochang), who used to be famous in Bai Xia, has recently entered the profession and has been reduced to a second-tier performer in Ping. She is currently working with Jin Shaoshan. Ms. Tao was famous in the opera world for her imitation of Mei. Now she is actually playing a supporting role. Presumably, she must not be very happy.

Epilogue

In addition to the people mentioned above, there are many female performers in the North who perform in plays once every twenty days a month. Liang Yunqiu, who came to Liyuan to perform "Gengxin" last time, and Li Yanxiu, who was once rumored to come to Liyuan to perform "Gengxin," both have this style. Yunqiu is a disciple of Xun Huisheng and performs under the banner of the Xun School in the North. However, her art is not yet excellent. Yanxiu has turned to Xiaoyun's school and has reportedly won Xiaoyun's appreciation. Therefore, she can perform many Shang School plays. Li's "White Jade Lotus" and "Lady Huarui" are all invested by Xiaoyun. Yanxiu has an older sister named Yanbao, who also studies Dan and imitates Cheng Yushuang. The sisters have variations, with the reputation of "Li's Variation Yan." Her art is only slightly better than Yunqiu's. Among the female performers in Tianjin, Yun Shi, Bingru, Zhang Fen, and Tong Qin are the most famous. Among these two people, Bingru is better, and You Qin is the worst. Yanfen came to Liyuan with Li Wanchun several years ago to share the same stage. Her art is still acceptable. Zhang Shulan and Shulan sisters were also among the best in Tianjin. As for Huan Sheng, Meng Xiaodong still sits in the first position. Xu Dongming is not worth mentioning. Meng Youdong (i.e., Chou Ledi) is Xiaodong's daughter and has been able to garner attention since her performance. In addition, Ms. Li Ying, who studied art from Chen Xiuhua, will also succeed You Biyun's successor. She is neither a performer nor a ticket holder, and there is no value in recording her.

### After Seeing the Motherland

— Junhui

The Shanghai Drama Society's "Motherland," since its premiere at the Lafayette Theater, has caused a sensation for a time. Driven by curiosity, I finally stepped into this park-like theater after dinner on the 3rd. The play was originally written by - Du, a play rich in national significance, translated by Mr. Jiang Wenxin of the China-France Friendship Association, and directed by Mr. Wu Jiangfan. The entire play is divided into six acts, and from the beginning to the end, it progresses in a tense atmosphere, constantly stimulating the audience's heartstrings without a moment of relaxation; for example, the tearful speech of the arrested woman in the first act, vividly depicting and exposing the soldiers' ugly behavior, is infuriating. After this, when Li An'er discovers that his wife is having an affair, and his rival is his right-hand man, Jia Erluo, his anger, pain, trauma, and disappointment are all expressed. Finally, for the sake of the motherland, he abandons this personal feud; at the end, Jia Erluo also kills his most beloved lover for the sake of the motherland. The costumes and scenery of the play are not very magnificent, but they do not hinder the performance of the play.

### New Film "Children of China"

— Jiao Chao

The Central Film Studio recently completed the new film "Children of China"; it is based on the true and glorious stories that have occurred since the War of Resistance and is divided into four segments, four independent stories:——The farmers were raped, and the farmers rose up to fight; (starring Zhao Dan) The children were killed, and the old people also rose up to save the country; (starring Gu Ersi) The beloved was bombed to death, and the youth resolutely went to the battlefield; (starring Shi Chao and Chen Yiping) In this great era, how many young male and female students completed their sacred mission; (starring Bai Yang and Wei Heling) These four stories, on the one hand, express their true meaning, and on the other hand, point out specific methods. It can be said to be a uniquely creative representative work in the Chinese film festival.
