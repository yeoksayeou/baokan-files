Editorial

### The Dead End of Japan's War of Aggression Against China

The brilliant war theorist Clausewitz once said: "War is merely the continuation of policy... because the political objective is the purpose, war is merely the means, and a means without a purpose is ultimately unimaginable." This famous saying has, for over a century, strengthened the world's understanding of the essence of war, and has also helped general scholars understand history. As for politicians and military strategists, they understand it as the most basic common sense. However, this war of aggression against China by the Japanese warlords is the only exception.

The Japanese warlords' continental policy has a historical origin of thirty to forty years, and they have painstakingly prepared and arranged it. Therefore, the occurrence of this war is only the inevitable result of the conflict between Chinese nationalism and Japanese aggression, and cannot be said to be accidental or coincidental. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Japanese side did not have a clear final intention in engaging in this war politically. However, judging from the evolution over the past two years, the order of events was military first, political second, with politics merely acting as the tail of the military, with the ability to mend and patch up the military's adventurous actions at any time. In the performance of the war process, it has never shown its exact goal, and is shifting, disjointed, and contradictory, at most putting forward a few empty slogans in due course to perfunctorily cope with the situation. The war has been going on for nearly three years, and most of the Japanese people are still ignorant and incomprehensible as to what its central meaning and final destination will be. The Saito slip of the tongue incident two months ago, even if it was fortunately not expanded into a major political event, the inner suffering and anxiety of the Japanese people, and their doubts about the essence of this war, have all been fully revealed, and cannot be concealed by merely expelling Saito from the parliament. Therefore, if we say that the war being waged by the Japanese warlords is precisely the kind that Clausewitz called unimaginable, it is not an excessively harsh judgment.

The Japanese authorities were not unaware of this shortcoming. Before stepping down last winter, Konoe solemnly announced the so-called "New Order in East Asia," undoubtedly to lay a political foundation for the war of aggression against China. Since then, although the cabinet has been changed several times, that principle has always been regarded as the highest guiding principle. The recent rapid political offensive and the visit to China by Abe and his party have reached the final stage of their implementation. However, the publication of that statement was when the Sino-Japanese war had been going on for a year and a half, and the whole of Japan was restless and uneasy because the war had fallen into a quagmire. Strictly speaking, it was the needs of the situation that forced out the answer of the so-called "New Order" statement, not the war of aggression that broke out in order to implement that principle. Looking at Japanese domestic public opinion over the years, although few people have openly criticized its emptiness and inappropriateness like Saito, it is full of incomprehension and suspicion. It is a major question whether it can ultimately achieve much effect in terms of spiritual mobilization. However, the Japanese authorities are setting up their political offensive on this basis, and are preparing to replay the story of Ito Hirobumi and Muto Nobuyoshi in Korea and Northeast China in Nanjing. This is like building towering pavilions on a soft sandy foundation, which may look brilliant and moving at first glance, but may all collapse in an instant. Thus, it is no wonder that Abe was not as complacent and high-spirited as Ito and Muto before he set out to China this time, but was instead full of doubts, and even lacked confidence in his own life and future.

In a recent speech, Yonai criticized the Japanese people for lacking the spirit to cope with hardships, blaming it on the lack of experience in prolonged wars and not having suffered like the European countries. This only explains part of the problem. China may lack even more experience in coping with long-term foreign wars than Japan, but for the past two or three years, the Chinese military and civilians, from top to bottom, have always been able to remain steadfast, calm, and invigorated, and have not been shaken by any internal or external changes or any means of the Japanese side. This is simply because China is fighting for the independence and freedom of the nation, a belief that has taken root in the hearts of the people since the outbreak of the incident, forming an invincible force, which is very different from the Japanese side's lack of a clear political goal. Even if the Japanese authorities can artificially create political theories in the middle of the war and launch political offensives in a variety of ways, they will ultimately be unable to establish a strong belief among the people and reverse their declining morale. Take a look at the recent Japanese measures towards China. While the official side is going all out, the public is indifferent to it, or even from time to time voicing doubts. If Konoe's statement can be seen as the key to dividing the stages of the war, then the Japanese actions before this were military blunders, and after this, they turned to devoting all their efforts to political speculation, all of which violated the war principle of achieving clear political goals by military means. The war of aggression against China for nearly three years has been conducted in this way. Now that the Japanese side has thrown out its last card politically, it will be even more difficult for the military operations to be coordinated with its political measures, forming an abnormal phenomenon of separation between the military and politics, and will ultimately be unable to avoid being useless and failing together.

### Fifth Session of the National Political Council - Supplementary Record of Chairman Chiang's Closing Remarks

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Secondly, developing the economy. My colleagues in this council have paid the most attention to the economy during the war. Whether reviewing reports or discussing proposals, they have been particularly thorough on economic matters. Many issues are already being considered by the government, and it is hoped that collective wisdom can be gathered to solve them. I am deeply gratified by your enthusiastic contributions. However, I have a few points I would like to mention in passing. I believe that China's economy is different in nature from other countries and cannot be viewed in the same way. It is natural for wartime economies to become more difficult over time, and China is no exception. However, China's war of resistance has been going on for nearly three years, and our past economic situation has been different from that encountered by other countries during the war. It can be said that the past two years or so have been generally better than in other warring nations. This is because our economic structure was not sound before the war, and our economic foundation was not fully developed. It is not easy to be able to sustain it until now, and the main reason is that China's economy is natural and suitable for a protracted war of resistance. The wartime economy is different from other industrial countries. Everyone is very concerned about the current problem of rising prices, but my view is somewhat different from yours. I believe that the prices of daily necessities for people's livelihood must be suppressed as much as possible, hoarding and speculation must be strictly prohibited, and transportation and supply must be improved. However, there is no need to worry about the future of the entire economy. This is the same as my view of military affairs before the war. It is not that we have no way to deal with the economy, but that we have not yet done our best. Otherwise, there will be no difficulties. Everyone must know that what our country now possesses are the three key elements of vast land, abundant resources, and a large population. We can obtain food and clothing anywhere. As for the problem of housing, it is even easier to solve. Clothing, food, and housing are the three major needs of the national economy. As long as we manage these three things properly and transport them effectively, there will be no problems. Therefore, I believe that as long as we work hard to produce, there is nothing to worry about regarding the future of the wartime economy. Moreover, the war of resistance is beneficial to the development and completion of our entire economic plan. The longer our war of resistance lasts, the more effective our economy will be. Furthermore, we have already established a second (three-year wartime economic plan). I can say that our wartime economy has absolutely no problems. We must know that diligence and hard work are the characteristics of our nation. As long as the government and the people work together with the spirit of wartime, not only will there be no problems, but we will also be able to make extra progress. Now, we must follow our established economic plan and the proposals of the conference, work hard to achieve them, and seek their implementation. Not only must the government make special efforts, but our citizens must also work together to supervise themselves, urge the government, and cooperate to increase production and manage properly. I can say that this will not only sustain the war of resistance but also gain the sympathy of friendly nations. If the situation becomes several times more difficult in the future, we will still be able to be self-sufficient and make our economic power stronger as we fight. Here, I would like to remind everyone, and the general public in particular, that we must be able to endure pain and hardship. We must not live our current wartime lives according to peacetime standards, and we must not complain about suffering even a little. We must anticipate that the future will be ten or twenty times more difficult than it is now. Therefore, we must now resolve to endure hardship and pain to bear this pain and overcome this difficulty. We must increase production as much as possible, reduce consumption to the extreme, and improve all economic measures at any time. The government must be extra responsible, and the people must be extra diligent and persevering. We must take the period after the Southern Song Dynasty when people indulged in ease and comfort and sought temporary safety as a warning. We must know that if the court and the public at that time could have endured pain, worked hard, and strived for progress, they would not have perished. Moreover, our foundation for victory has now been established. I dare say that the enemy will never be able to destroy China in the future. I am only afraid that we ourselves will be lax and disorganized, leading to our own destruction. Therefore, we must be especially responsible, pay attention to integrity, and not allow the achievements made by the bloodshed of our soldiers and the suffering of our compatriots to be completely ruined. In the future, with regard to the economy, we must adapt to the situation and gradually improve our measures. If we discover shortcomings, we must correct them immediately. Corruption must be punished, and negligence must be abandoned. In short, as long as we can endure pain and hardship, we will surely achieve the goal of victory in the war of resistance. Thirdly, regarding the implementation of constitutional government, in this session, everyone spoke frankly and openly and expressed their opinions as much as possible, and the discussions were very enthusiastic. Although we did not reach a conclusion due to time constraints, our colleagues can continue to study after the meeting to achieve success. This council will send the draft constitution and everyone's opinions to the government for the National Assembly to adopt and make the final decision. I briefly expressed my views in the middle of the meeting two days ago, and now I want to reiterate a few words. I believe that whether the constitution itself is perfect is one issue, and whether it can be implemented is another issue, and who implements the constitution is also an issue. Everyone must know that the people I am referring to today as those who implement the constitution are not referring to the government alone. In my opinion on the implementation of the constitution, on the one hand, the government must assume the responsibility and ability to implement the constitution, and on the other hand, the people themselves must have the responsibility and ability to implement the constitution. I am currently in charge of administration, and the views I expressed the day before yesterday were not from the position of the administrative authorities, fearing that the government would be bound by the constitution. This is the same as everyone's enthusiastic discussion of their own views on the constitution. This is not for our own sake, but for the benefit of the country and the people in the future. I personally hope that the constitution will be established, not just for a year or two, but it has been my consistent hope for ten years that the constitution can be promulgated and implemented as soon as possible. However, my heart is completely a blank slate, and there are absolutely no preconceived ideas. My only hope is that after the constitution is promulgated, especially in the first ten or twenty years, it can be implemented effectively and smoothly, without obstacles or disputes. The Republic of China has been established for almost thirty years. Our country has not been able to embark on the right track of democracy, and there have been countless disputes over the promulgation and destruction of laws. Many of our colleagues here today have personally experienced this and suffered this pain. We all have the responsibility to implement the constitution. We must not forget the painful experiences and lessons of the past thirty years, and we must not forget the infinite pain suffered by the people of the whole country over the constitution issue, and the infinite losses suffered by our country. Therefore, we must not casually adopt a constitution today that will cause the country to suffer further losses and the people to suffer further pain. Therefore, I would like to sincerely contribute two points: (1) The matter of constitution-making should be entirely for the true benefit of the country and the people. We should not only pay attention to the past but also consider the present and the future. With regard to the past, we must pay attention to our country's history and consistent national conditions, and learn from the painful lessons since the Republic of China. With regard to the present, we must consider the actual environment of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, and at the same time, with regard to the future, we must also consider the future situation within ten or twenty years after the promulgation of the constitution and the long-term plan for the country and the nation, and establish a good foundation for the constitution. We must carefully consider how to strengthen national defense, how to develop the overall happiness of the people, and how to consolidate the true rights of the people. I often say that the most important thing in the meaning of implementation is to be thorough. We must ensure that there is not a single provision that cannot be implemented in order to establish an unshakable foundation for constitutional government. (2) Since we want to build China into a Republic of the Three Principles of the People, the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution must not be violated. Since we all unanimously support Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, we must understand the essence of the distinction between (power) and (ability) and the true meaning of the creation of the Five-Power system. We must not have any conflicts with the provisions of the Five-Power Constitution. If there are any provisions that we believe cannot be achieved for the time being and need to be gradually strengthened and gradually improved, then we must of course have the temporary expedient of making temporary changes. However, we must not have any attached conditions to the Three Principles of the People, nor can we have any clauses in the constitution itself that violate the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution. Therefore, I believe that the provisions of the constitution should be adapted to the facts as much as possible, and we should pay attention to our many unwritten precedents. Therefore, the provisions should not be too detailed and should be flexible, and each provision should be practical. The above has reviewed the most important issues of this session and contributed my personal opinions. Now, our fifth session is adjourned. Within six months, we will convene the National Assembly. Our work of resisting the war and building the country is becoming increasingly tense. After the adjournment, there are many matters that we expect our colleagues to work together on. In the past, our colleagues have gone through thick and thin together, avoiding hard work and complaints, and working together with one heart and one mind to overcome difficulties. This is not only my personal gratitude but also gives the greatest encouragement to the soldiers and civilians of the whole country. Today, I would like to give everyone a word: to complete the task of resisting the war and building the country and save our country, the most important thing is to pay attention to practice. Everything cannot be divorced from reality. This is what I always warn myself and hope to encourage each other with my colleagues. Because the work of saving the country must be difficult and hard. Not only are we physically exhausted, but we are also mentally more exhausted. We must pay attention to practice, avoid hard work and complaints, and be careful and considerate of danger. We must work together and not be careless in the slightest. What I have always warned myself in my life is not to be ambitious. We must know that our most important task is to seek China's independence, freedom, peace, and equality. Now, the Japanese soldiers have not yet been driven out, the country has not yet been successfully built, and the people are still suffering. In the eyes of foreigners, we Chinese are really not as good as slaves of a conquered country. Therefore, we must not forget the current pain and shame of our country. Throughout history, cliques and factions have harmed the country by ignoring the country's difficulties and dangers. Therefore, they indulged in mutual rivalry. What Japan hopes we will create is such a lax and disorganized country. And the spirit expressed in this session is completely contrary to their malicious speculation. This is a very powerful counterattack against the puppet Japanese. I hope that our colleagues will be down-to-earth in the future, whether in constitution-making and implementation or in resisting the war and building the country, and lead the people to fight hard with a pragmatic spirit. In short, we must faithfully estimate the current real environment and take on all the difficult and dangerous tasks that we should have. We will not boast, and we will not belittle ourselves. I hope that all colleagues will carry forward the consistent spirit of sharing weal and woe over the past two years and work harder for the country and be frank friends for each other in the future, and work together to carry out our sacred mission.

### Military Commission Announces Weekly War Situation - April 12 to 19

Chongqing The spokesperson of the Military Commission stated that during the week (April 12 to 19), the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and Shanxi inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army and achieved astonishing results. The following is a summary of the combat process:

After recapturing Jing'an, Fengxin, and many other strongholds in northern Jiangxi, the Chinese army continued to besiege Nanchang and Anyi and launched a heroic positional battle with the Japanese army, who were stubbornly resisting. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, and several more major strongholds were recaptured. In order to save the critical situation, the Japanese army launched a large-scale counterattack starting on the 14th, attempting to occupy Xiangtang for a long time. After the Chinese army's brave attack and two days and nights of bloody battle, the Japanese army was finally defeated, and Xiangtang was recaptured. The remaining Japanese army retreated to Nanchang. The Chinese army fiercely pursued, and the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties. In the past two or three days, the Japanese army has continued to receive reinforcements in the Nanchang and Anyi area. The Chinese army's various units have taken advantage of the Japanese army's unstable footing to continue their full-scale attack and inflicted fatal blows on the Japanese army near Nanchang. The Japanese army is trapped in a heavy siege and is extremely panicked.

The Chinese army in Hubei has launched a large-scale attack to break through the stubborn Japanese army and approach the outskirts of Wuhan. They have engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the Xinzhou and Tuanfeng areas, inflicting extremely heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese army retreated to Huanggang and Tuanfeng, not daring to make any reckless moves. They recaptured the two major strongholds of Macheng and Dupo and are taking advantage of the victory to expand their battle results. They defeated the Japanese army that attempted to invade Qiliping, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. They are fiercely pursuing the retreating Japanese army, and the vanguard has reached the city of Huanggang. They have repeatedly carried out flank attacks on the Japanese army in Wangdian, Sunqiao, and other places, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. The Japanese army trapped in Wuhan is greatly threatened.

The Japanese army in Linqu, Juxian, Rizhao, and other places in southern Shandong has been gathering the remnants of the Japanese army for days and launched a large-scale invasion of the area east of Linqu in separate routes. After the Chinese army's mobile counterattack, they engaged in fierce battles, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army collapsed completely and retreated in disarray. Their so-called "mopping-up" attempt has completely failed. At the same time,

The Chinese army in northern Jiangsu took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce attack on the rear of the Japanese army, echoing each other. In the past few days, they have successively invaded Funing and approached Lianshui. After suffering heavy losses, the Japanese army is feeling the pain of being unable to attend to both ends. Near Changzi in southeastern Shanxi, fierce battles have been raging for the past week, with nearly a thousand Japanese soldiers killed. The Japanese army in southern Shanxi has also gathered seven or eight thousand troops, dozens of cannons, and more than twenty aircraft and launched a large-scale invasion of the Zhongtiao Mountains for the eleventh time. The Chinese army used a mobile posture, using superior terrain to attack from all sides. The Japanese army fled in panic and was unable to cope. As of the 18th, over two thousand Japanese soldiers had been killed. In addition, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack and captured Hengshui Town in one fell swoop and is continuing its attack. The Japanese army's dream of cutting off the transportation between Shanxi and Henan will definitely not succeed. In addition,

The Chinese army in southern Chahar has been fiercely attacking the Japanese army invading Yuxian for days. As of the 14th, over six hundred Japanese soldiers had been killed. The Chinese army in southern Hebei attacked Daming and defeated the Yamaguchi team of the Japanese army invading near Dongming, inflicting heavy casualties. The Chinese army recaptured Luowang Station in northeastern Henan, and over half of the thousand Japanese troops invading Shouxian in central Anhui were wiped out by the Chinese army. Fierce battles are now taking place in the suburbs. In western Zhejiang, the Japanese army in the Hangjiahu area was defeated one by one, and they rushed into Haiyan Jiangnan, fiercely attacking Miaoxing Town, threatening Shanghai. In Guangdong, Jiangyimen was captured, and in Guangxi, the defeated Japanese army continued to be pursued and annihilated, inflicting heavy casualties. These are all important achievements in the past week. (21st dispatch)

### Overseas Chinese Liu Fuchu in South Africa Donates £900 in British Gold

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will present a plaque to express its gratitude and request the Executive Yuan to issue a certificate of merit. (21st dispatch)

### Dr. Monroe Talks About Impressions of Chongqing

Hong Kong Dr. Monroe, a famous American educator, was interviewed by a Central News Agency reporter on the 21st. He said that when he was in Chongqing, he visited Chairman Chiang and Presidents Sun and Kong and was deeply impressed. The industrial construction in the interior has made amazing progress. They are now actively developing natural resources and strengthening the war resistance forces. Over 1,500 new industries have been established, including cotton weaving, steel, wool, fuel, and minerals. In addition, political institutions are striving to improve, and promising young people are being used to replace old officials, and the government is full of vigorous atmosphere. The government is very confident in the victory of the war resistance. Even people from various countries in Chongqing are deeply convinced that China will win the final victory, because the new China can now be self-reliant and does not need to rely entirely on foreign aid. Dr. Monroe also said that he remembered more than ten years ago when Chairman Chiang asked him what China needed most. He replied that it was a firm and powerful leader. Now that he sees what Chairman Chiang has done, he cannot help but feel deeply grateful for China's success in obtaining such a person. Dr. Monroe showed a smile when he spoke, and his sincere sympathy for us was deeply moving. (21st dispatch)

The newspaper also said, "Chinese workers have always shown their courage and determination to help the government defeat the enemy during the war of resistance. Workers on the front lines are often helping the army fight, while workers in the rear are often working to open up mountain roads to facilitate military transportation."

Stockholm, Sweden: It is reported that German and Allied forces have clashed at Namsos. The German army was unable to occupy Grong, which is 25 miles from Namsos, and could not transport troops by rail.

It is reported that the Norwegian army is still defending Hegra and has rejected the German proposal to negotiate surrender. (Reuters, 21st)

London: A Reuters correspondent on the Norwegian-Swedish border reports that British troops who landed in Namsos are currently consolidating their positions east of Namsos. The area is mountainous, with dense forests and deep snow, so the difficulties faced by the British troops cannot be ignored. The Canadian ski team accompanying the British troops will find their experience very valuable. According to a refugee who skied one hundred miles from Norway to the border, he saw many teams of Norwegian soldiers en route to Namsos to join the British forces. They are familiar with the terrain but are poorly armed and untrained in modern warfare. He saw some of them carrying only rifles and a small amount of ammunition. (Reuters, 21st)

Stockholm, Sweden: According to reports, the great battle to capture Trondheim has matured in the Norway-Rørvik area. The Norwegian army at the Hegra Fortress, 20 kilometers northeast of Hell, has repelled the German offensive. The Norwegian army defending the fortress seems determined to defend it to the death. Although German planes bombed Hegra heavily yesterday, the Norwegian artillery continued to shell the German-occupied Vaernes airfield yesterday afternoon and in between. Last night, it was generally believed here that Allied troops had landed at three major locations in Norway: Namsos, Molde, and Åndalsnes, while Elverum and Hamar appeared to be firmly in German hands. (United Press, 21st)

Berlin: Regarding the active reinforcement of German troops in Trondheim, the Haitong News Agency has learned from reliable sources that a large number of fresh troops and a large amount of military supplies did land in the port yesterday according to plan.

(Reuters, 21st)

German Battle Report Claims British Cruiser Destroyed

### Tensions Between Italy and Yugoslavia; France's Attitude Remains Unchanged; Prepared to Discuss All Outstanding Issues at Any Time, But Will Not Tolerate New Acts of Aggression; Italian Newspapers Boast of the Strength of the Italian Navy in the Mediterranean

Paris: Diplomatic circles here have stated that the international situation has had a positive impact on French domestic politics, as evidenced by the unanimous passage of the confidence vote in the Renault cabinet by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. It is reported that when Prime Minister Renault spoke to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate yesterday, he stated that the goals of the United Kingdom and France in southeastern Europe were to maintain peace, that is, to maintain a peace that would guarantee the independence of the Balkan countries. The meaning of this is that the two major democracies of Western Europe will not tolerate new acts of aggression in other parts of Europe. As for the Italian issue, Prime Minister Renault once said that around September 1st of last year, that is, before and after the outbreak of the European war, the French government repeatedly asked the Italian government if it was willing to conduct talks on various outstanding issues, but the Italian government did not respond. However, France's attitude remains unchanged and it is still prepared to contact Italy at any time. Regarding the relationship between France and Italy, the two sides concluded an agreement in 1935 to resolve all issues, including the Tunisian issue, "effectively." However, at the end of 1938, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano unilaterally declared it abolished. However, the Italian government has never explained how it intends to establish a balance of power between France and Italy. Although the so-called "natural desires" hinted at by various newspapers in Italy include Tunisia, Gibraltar, Corsica, and even Nice and Savoy, they are of no value from a diplomatic point of view. (Havas, 20th)

Washington: According to reliable diplomatic sources here, Prime Minister Mussolini has readied Italy's military apparatus and is preparing to conduct a small, bloodless raid in the Balkans. Foreign opinion here is that the Italian Prime Minister may dispatch heavily concentrated troops within days to advance north from Albania and occupy the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia, so that the entire Upper Adriatic Sea will fall under Italian control. It is also reported that Mussolini will use the same trick that the Germans used to occupy Denmark. He believes that the Allies will not interfere, and that Yugoslavia will not resist. Some experts studying the Balkans say that Yugoslavia's non-resistance is hard to believe, while others say that Yugoslavia would rather endure Italy's tolerable demands than be destroyed by Germany. The reason for this view is that the activities of the Fascist Party in Yugoslavia are not interfered with, while the "fifth column" of the Nazi Party has been expelled from Yugoslavia. Informed sources believe that Mussolini's dispatch of troops to occupy the Dalmatian coast is a small part of his Mediterranean plan. This Mediterranean invasion plan is all-encompassing and wide-ranging. Mussolini has shelved it, or even abandoned it, because he fears that it will immediately lead to war between Britain and France against Italy. It is understood that if Italy follows the plan, it would have to use all its naval, land, and air forces to simultaneously occupy the Dalmatian coast, the Balearic Islands, British Gibraltar, and Greece, whose territorial integrity is guaranteed by the Allies, and then make Greece a protectorate of Italy, incorporate the Balearic Islands into Italy, and give Gibraltar to Spain as compensation. Mussolini would then hold on to the territory he had invaded and await the Allied counterattack. Mussolini then thought that his naval power could cope with the French fleet, but he also thought that the British Navy would assist the French Navy, but he did not know to what extent it could reinforce it. If the British fleet does not withdraw from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea, Mussolini will never dare to try it easily. Now, judging from Germany's invasion of Norway, the United Kingdom has no need to weaken the strength of the Mediterranean fleet, that is, the Germans have failed to implement their plan to lure the tiger away from the mountain. According to another report, the Mediterranean invasion plan was proposed to Mussolini by Germany. (International News Agency, 20th)

Sofia: The "Zhara" newspaper here recently carried a telegram from a visitor stationed in Rome stating that the Italian newspapers have changed their tone, and the commentaries published today no longer attack the United Kingdom and France, but instead speak of Italy's "peaceful intentions." The reason for this is that the British side has hinted that it is prepared to make concessions to Italy. According to informed observers, the Italian newspapers are now adopting a "diplomatic" posture, waiting for the United Kingdom to put forward concrete proposals. (Havas, 20th)

Milan: The Italian semi-official publication "International Relations" commented on the Allies' attempt to drag neutral countries into the war, saying that the Italian people have no illusions, and do not want to be caught off guard and become the object of others' cunning plans. They will wait for events to unfold with a calm attitude and deal with them with the utmost determination until they have won victory. The democracies are now praising the Italian government's peaceful policies, but the Italian people do not want to be praised. The Italian people have their own plans, and these plans will eventually be implemented. Italy will only rely on its military equipment, as an answer to the power politics of Europe. (Reuters, 21st)

Rome: The famous Italian journalist Randa wrote in an editorial in the "Italian News" that with the support of the Air Force, the current Italian Navy is capable of defeating the British and French fleets in the Mediterranean. It is superficial and naive to think that because the Italian Navy's tonnage is smaller than the British Navy's, and even smaller than the total tonnage of the British and French navies, it will be completely destroyed in the Mediterranean within 24 hours. At present, there are not only surface warships, but also submarines and aircraft. Italy has more than 100 submarines, and its air force is also strong. The current European war has proven that the Air Force has changed the military strategy of naval warfare. A 200 kg bomb is four times more effective than a 500 kg shell. 52 aircraft can defeat a fleet of three battleships, five cruisers, six destroyers, six submarines, and one aircraft carrier. This was the experience gained during the British naval exercises in 1934. The communication lines in the Mediterranean are easily attacked. The Italian Navy and Air Force are now in a position to destroy the enemy. (Haitong, 21st)

### Yugoslav Minister of Justice Visits Hungary

Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The Minister of Justice, Marangović, visited the capital of Hungary for three days and departed this afternoon to return to his country. Before leaving, he told reporters that the government of Yugoslavia intends to establish a new foundation for the mutual cooperation of the countries in the Danube River basin. The Hungarian authorities have fully understood this proposal. It may be mentioned that Marangović served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the previous cabinet. (Havas, 20th)

### Germany and Italy Dispatch Military Officers to Each Other for Military Talks; Munitions Supply is the Main Topic of Discussion

Bern, Switzerland: The Basle Evening News correspondent in Berlin telegraphed that the governments of Germany and Italy have recently sent military delegations to each other. This is different from the ordinary talks conducted by the military authorities of the two countries, and is a military delegation with a special mission. The main issue to be discussed by both sides is probably the issue of munitions supply. In addition, German newspapers have deliberately created alarm, saying that the joint operations of the British and French fleets in the Norwegian waters have created a major crisis for Italy. For example, the German General Gazette stated that the sole goal of the British and French navies' actions in Northern Europe is to facilitate their activities in the Mediterranean. Italy's sphere of influence will become the target of their next attack. (Havas, 20th)

The Hague: It is reported that the Soviet Ambassador to Germany has returned to Berlin, and the theory of the German-Italian-Soviet agreement has resurfaced. It is rumored that the Soviet Ambassador carried a detailed memorandum on the settlement of the Balkan events to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (Reuters, 21st)

### Armed Merchant Ships Banned From Romanian Waters

Bucharest: The government has decided that, effective immediately, merchant ships of belligerent countries with guns ranging from 75 mm to 160 mm or more are prohibited from entering the territorial waters of Romania. Even if they are only equipped with guns of less than 160 mm, they must seal off the guns before they can enter the Romanian ports along the Black Sea coast. If these ships want to go up the Danube River, they must leave their weapons and ammunition at the Romanian ports of Subina and Bazia. (Havas, 20th)

### Economic Relations Between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia; The Tone of Yugoslav Newspapers

Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The newspapers here continue to focus on the restoration of economic relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Among them, the News of the City of Zagreb stated, "Normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is an important factor in safeguarding peace in the Balkans. From an economic point of view, at a time when the European war is expanding, it is not easy for Yugoslavia to obtain the goods it needs. In the future, it is extremely important to be able to trade with the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union can supply Yugoslavia with trucks, agricultural machinery, kerosene, coal, and other important goods. In short, the Soviet Union has decided to avoid getting involved in the current European war. Since the country is willing to do so, and both belligerent countries, the United Kingdom and France, and Germany, want to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet government." (Havas, 20th)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The Yugoslav economic delegation departed for Moscow this evening via Bucharest, Romania. It is estimated that it will arrive on the 25th of this month, at which time it will hold negotiations with the Soviet authorities. Chief Representative Đorđević paid a visit to Foreign Minister Marković for instructions before his departure. (Havas, 21st)

### British Foreign Minister Responds to the Soviet Ambassador; Prepared to Reopen Trade Negotiations; The British Government Has Considered the Soviet Proposal

London: Reuters has learned from official sources that British Foreign Secretary Halifax has met with the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, and informed him that the British government has considered the Soviet proposal for commercial talks and is now prepared to discuss with the Soviet government in an experiential manner whether there is a basis for concluding a commercial treaty, taking into account the situation in Europe. (Reuters, 21st)

London: The British government has accepted the Soviet proposal and should focus on reopening trade negotiations. All newspapers here attach great importance to this matter. The Observer stated, "Germany dreams of using the Soviet Union as a colony to obtain raw materials. If the United Kingdom can reach a compromise with the Moscow government, then Germany's dream will become a bubble. Its importance goes without saying." The Sunday Times stated that the fact that Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union are conducting commercial talks is noteworthy, and it should be known that after the talks between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, not only will the relations between the two sides improve, but it will also improve the relations between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, because Bulgaria is the Soviet Union's first friend in the Balkans. (Havas, 21st)

### British Aircraft Bombing of Danish Airport

London - The Air Ministry recently announced that British aircraft had flown to and bombed the airport in Aalborg, northern Denmark, last night, with great success. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

London - The Air Ministry announced that the offensive against the German Air Force and air transport units in Norway continued to develop last night and this morning. In addition to successfully attacking the German base at Aalborg in northern Denmark, British aircraft also bombed German-occupied airfields in Kristiansand and Stavanger last night. It is now known that in the attack on Aalborg, bombs dropped from low altitude damaged a hangar. Another aircraft strafed a German transport plane that had just landed there with bombs and machine guns. Other aircraft set fires on the ground. Several German aircraft parked on the ground in Kristiansand were destroyed. In Stavanger, several bombs landed on the airfield's runway, causing explosions, and bombs also landed on the nearby seaplane base. This attack was carried out by a large number of aircraft, all of which returned safely to base. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### German and French Aircraft Invade Belgian Airspace; Belgian Authorities Lodge Protests Separately

Brussels - The Ministry of National Defence recently issued a public statement stating that several foreign aircraft had invaded Belgian airspace this morning. Some of these have been identified as German, while others are French. Belgian anti-aircraft batteries and fighter squadrons immediately went into action and drove away the foreign aircraft. One German aircraft was shot down within the territory of Vesela Nergen in Belgium. A French aircraft, while pursuing a German aircraft, was forced to land in Flavion, Belgium, where it was detained by the Belgian authorities and the pilot was confined. The government lodged serious protests separately with the French and German governments. In addition, four foreign aircraft of unknown nationality were seen fighting in the skies over Balisful, Belgium. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### Norwegian Foreign Minister Refutes German Propaganda; Accuses Germany of Atrocities

Stockholm - The German government issued a statement via wireless telegraph yesterday, stating that "German troops respect international law and never harm Norwegian civilians who are outside the war zone; therefore, Norwegian civilians can ensure their safety." Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht issued a statement in his personal capacity, strongly refuting this, stating: "I can personally attest that this German propaganda is untrue. When His Majesty King Haakon VII and Crown Prince Olav were residing in a small town with absolutely no military targets, it was heavily bombed by German aircraft. I was present at the time and witnessed it. This shows that the German claim that this operation is only against political enemies is purely deceptive. In short, the facts of the German atrocities and illegal aggression we have suffered are obvious and cannot be concealed by any German fabrications." (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### Swedish Iron Ore and the Question of Transport to Germany

Moscow - The Soviet trade union newspaper "Trud" published an article discussing Swedish iron ore, stating: "Even if the port of Narvik cannot be used as an export base, Swedish iron ore can still be transported to Germany as usual. Sweden ranks first in Europe in iron ore exports. The quality is excellent, with a high iron content, making it one of the best in the world. The amount exported to Germany accounts for three-quarters of Sweden's production, with only 17% exported to countries such as the UK, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Although Swedish iron ore exports through the port of Narvik have decreased due to the impact of the war, the amount exported through the port of Luleå in the Bothnian Bay and various ports along the Baltic Sea has greatly increased. One of the reasons why Britain is expanding the war's threat to Scandinavia is to cut off the route for Swedish iron ore to Germany. If Scandinavia is drawn into the war, the routes to Luleå and other ports may not last long. Therefore, German and Swedish political circles are currently discussing the issue of transporting iron ore from Malmberget, Kiruna, and Gällivare through Luleå." (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 21st)

### British King Presents Polish Prime Minister with Military Medal

Paris - The British Ambassador to France, Campbell, recently presented General Władysław Sikorski, the Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, with the Military Cross on behalf of the King of England.

### US Congressman Reintroduces Embargo Bill to Deal with Dutch East Indies Issue; Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi Visits Hull for Talks

Washington - Members of the US Congress who advocate for an embargo against Japan reintroduced the embargo bill yesterday in support of Secretary of State Hull's policy on the Dutch East Indies, in order to give Hull new weapons to deal with the Dutch East Indies issue. Democratic Senator Schwellenbach told reporters yesterday that he would ask Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman to restart Schwellenbach's embargo bill after Pittman returns to Washington on Sunday. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

Washington - Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horinouchi held a meeting with US Secretary of State Cordell Hull yesterday. Horinouchi voluntarily informed Hull that the Tokyo government felt that the United States and Japan did not disagree on the issue of the Dutch East Indies. After meeting with Hull, Horinouchi told reporters that he told Hull that Japan had "major interests" in the Dutch East Indies, but that Japan did not claim to have "special interests" there. Last Monday, Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita's statement in Tokyo on Japan's policy toward the Dutch East Indies was used to review how the Hague government's policy would be if the European war expanded and foreign countries wanted to protect the Dutch East Indies. Horinouchi concluded that Japan considered the statements issued by the United States and the Netherlands to be satisfactory. He declined to explain what Hull said to him or how he interpreted Arita's statement. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

Washington - Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi met with Secretary of State Hull for an hour yesterday and issued a statement afterwards stating that the talks were initiated by him and focused on the general situation in the Pacific, but he did not submit any memorandums. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

London - The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent stated that well-informed sources in London felt that there was no danger of the current situation in the Pacific being disturbed. Dutch officials also held the same view, believing that there was no reason for some people to predict that if the Netherlands were drawn into the war, the status quo of its East Indies territories would inevitably change. Both the Netherlands proper and the Dutch East Indies adhered to the same policy, which was to resist any attack to defend independence. The correspondent continued that the islands could undoubtedly be defended against any sudden attack, unless the opponent's military force was very strong. It was conceivable that it would be difficult for Japan to concentrate a large army there, far from its main base. At the same time, the stationing of most of the US Navy in the Pacific and the strong base of the British Pacific Fleet in Singapore could all be regarded as stabilizing factors. The consensus among all sectors of the Netherlands was that the best way to maintain the status quo was to adhere to the traditional policy of keeping the East Indies open and to defend themselves against all attacks under all circumstances. Therefore, all speculation about what would happen if Japan seized the Dutch East Indies was far from the truth. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### US Nationwide Hopes to Expand Navy; Achievements of British and French in Norway May Prompt Passage of Bill

Washington - It is generally believed here that the achievements of the British and French fleets in the Norwegian campaign and the failure of the German Air Force to break the British and French maritime control are the reasons why the Naval Expansion Bill will pass in the House of Representatives. It is also generally believed that the expansion of the European war to Norway has also given people a new understanding of the naval expansion bill advocated by House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson. However, opponents of the bill to expand the Navy by 11% claim that although the Naval Expansion Bill had only four votes against it in the Senate and was supported by a majority, the Naval Expansion Bill would likely face strong opposition in the Senate. Colorado Democratic Senator Johnson said that the Vinson Naval Bill would definitely be opposed, while South Carolina Democratic Senator Byrnes, who was the first to support the Naval Expansion Bill, predicted that the Vinson Naval Bill would definitely pass because the whole country now hopes to expand the Navy for reasonable defense.

New York - The New York Civil Voice Forum recently published an editorial arguing that the United States must have a navy capable of protecting the entire Western Hemisphere, and therefore there is ample reason to build the strongest fleet in the world. It said: "If there is a need to deal with force with force in the future, which country must bear the greatest responsibility is understood by the world. In terms of naval power in the Western Hemisphere alone, we believe that it is possible to unite the fleets of the United States, Central, and South American countries to form a Pan-American fleet. At that time, Central and South American countries should provide naval bases, and the United States should send warships to be stationed at these bases." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### Roosevelt Broadcast Speech Advocates Continuing the New Deal; Watches Developments with Calm Demeanor; No Indication on Third Term Presidency

Warm Springs - President Roosevelt gave a broadcast speech here yesterday to Democratic youth members, focusing on domestic affairs, vigorously defending the New Deal, and advocating for its continued implementation. He did not give any indication on the issue of whether he was prepared to run for a third term as president. His key words were: "I do not intend to talk about foreign affairs tonight. Those Republicans are now conducting a propaganda campaign, attacking me for leading the United States into war, which is nonsense. It must be known that the government is currently watching the evolution of the situation with a calm demeanor. We do not want to participate in the wars that are happening in Europe or Asia, of course. However, I also do not agree with the statement by a certain Republican candidate that the United States and the American people should absolutely not participate in the work of establishing a better world order." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Georgia - President Roosevelt delivered a speech at a Young Democrats conference here yesterday, advocating for the election of a Democrat as president in 1941.

### Japanese Forging Chinese Legal Tender; Twelve Arrested in Tokyo; Two Masterminds Still at Large

Tokyo - According to Japanese newspaper reports, Japanese police have arrested twelve people who forged Chinese legal tender and are currently arresting the two masterminds. The police received a confidential report that several Japanese merchants in Tokyo and Osaka provided 33,000 yen in funds to operate a printing business to forge legal tender, and they launched an investigation. Twelve people involved in the case were arrested in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, and other places. Since November 1938, the masterminds had a plan to forge legal tender. After obtaining funding from Tokyo and Osaka merchants in February 1939, they used photogravure to forge 100,000 five-yuan banknotes. It is believed that approximately 450,000 yuan had been dispersed throughout China. A lacquer company's factory was used as a counterfeit currency manufacturing site. One mastermind, named Shirabe, 51 years old, and another named Tagita, are currently at large. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### Thirteen Members of the Ministry of Education's Academic Review Committee Have Been Selected; Including Feng Youlan, Fu Sinian, Zhu Kezhen, etc.

(Chongqing Airmail) In April of the 27th year, the Kuomintang held a temporary national congress and passed an outline of wartime education implementation plans at all levels, in which the twelfth key point stated, "The highest national academic review body should be established immediately to improve academic standards." Based on this plan, the Ministry of Education formulated and promulgated the Academic Review Committee Charter in July of the 28th year. According to the provisions of the charter, in addition to the Vice Minister and the Director of Higher Education as ex officio members, the committee was to have 25 appointed members, 12 of whom would be directly appointed by the Ministry, and 13 of whom would be appointed by the Ministry after being elected by the presidents of national colleges and universities. The Ministry immediately formulated election methods based on these provisions. According to Article 2 of the method, "Appointed members will be elected by the presidents of national colleges and universities using a secret ballot method, with two members elected from each of the liberal arts, science, and law disciplines, and one member elected from each of the agriculture, engineering, commerce, medicine, education, art, military, and physical education disciplines. Each discipline was assigned an quota. In December of the 28th year, the Ministry of Education printed ballots and distributed them to various colleges and universities for election. By January of this year, the ballots from various units had been sent to the Ministry one after another. The election results are as follows. Those with the most votes in each discipline, who should be appointed as members according to the election method, are: Liberal Arts: Feng Youlan, ten votes (Philosophy), Fu Sinian, six votes (History); Science, Zhu Kezhen, seven votes (Meteorology), Wu Youxun, six votes (Physics); Law, Zhou Gengsheng, ten votes (Law), Wang Shijie, six votes (Politics); Engineering, Mao Yisheng, seven votes (Civil Engineering); Commerce, Ma Yinchu, nine votes (Commerce); Medicine, Yan Fuqing, ten votes (Medicine); Art, Teng Gu, eight votes (Literature and Art). 2. For each discipline, those with the same number of votes should draw lots to determine one person to be further appointed. Education: Jiang Menglin and Liao Shicheng each received six votes; Agriculture: Xin Shuzhi and Zou Shuwen each received five votes; Military and Physical Education: Zhang Boling, Hao Gengsheng, Ma Yuehan, and Yuan Jili each received four votes. According to Article 3 of the Election Method for Appointed Members of the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, the personnel with the same votes in the second category of the above three disciplines should hold a lottery to determine the elected persons in each discipline. The Ministry of Education requested Wang Shijie, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, to supervise the lottery on March 20 of this year. The results of the lottery determined Jiang Menglin for Education, Zou Shuwen for Agriculture, and Ma Yuehan for Military and Physical Education. The elected personnel from the aforementioned disciplines will be appointed by the Minister of Education as members of the Academic Review Committee.

### Small-Scale Soccer Match Yesterday Samsung and Portugal Draw M. Su Ruo Insults Audience, Causing Unhappiness Ge Lian Defeats Jingxiang Dongseilei Wins Against Universe

The Zhen Dan Cup small-scale soccer tournament saw clear weather yesterday, with a total of eleven matches played in the A and B divisions. The morning matches were all in the B division. In the afternoon, crowds flocked to the venue, filling every space in the one-dollar seats. The competition was exciting, but unfortunately, two disputes arose, marring the event. Fortunately, the organizers handled the situations appropriately. One incident occurred during the match between Wen She and Russian Overseas Chinese in the morning. Wen She player Ma Yuting acted barbarically, and in addition to being ejected by the referee on the spot, he was also banned from playing in two matches by the organizers. The other incident occurred in the final match between Samsung and Portuguese Merchants in the afternoon. Portuguese Merchants' goalkeeper M. Su Ruo insulted the audience and was also ejected from the field.

Samsung Draws with Portuguese Merchants

The final match between Samsung and Portuguese Merchants was a close contest. All of Portuguese Merchants' star players were present, creating a strong presence. Goalkeeper M. Su Ruo made countless saves. In the 18th minute, Samsung goalkeeper Dong Jincai mistakenly took four steps while holding the ball and was penalized with a free kick. Xue Erfo successfully converted the kick. Ten minutes later, Wu Shaotai broke through the center, scoring a goal for each team, ending the first half with a tied score. In the second half, Samsung controlled the attack. Yi Yanjin and Zhou Dan fired shots like bullets, but Su Ruo's performance was outstanding. Wu Shaotai missed a sure goal with an air ball. With only minutes left in the match, the Portuguese team was surrounded, and the audience cheered loudly. M. Su Ruo became angry and threw the ball violently at the crowd, causing public outrage. The game was halted for nearly fifteen minutes. As a result, referee Paris ruled that Su Ruo should leave the field and be replaced by Aquino, and then play was resumed. Samsung eventually drew with Portuguese Merchants, each scoring one goal.

Since obtaining the assistance of Donghua's Qin Bicao, Hu Hanwen, and Gao Baozheng, Ge Lian's strength has been greatly enhanced. In yesterday's match against Jingxiang, Bicao initially played as the right wing, demonstrating his defensive abilities. Before long, Gao Baozheng scored a goal with a header from a corner kick taken by Shi Yi, giving Ge Lian a 1-0 lead. After a prolonged battle, Liu Guocai of Jingxiang scored, tying the score at 1-1. The first half ended in a tie. In the second half, Bicao moved to goalkeeper and Zhuang Jifang played as center forward, making significant changes to Ge Lian's lineup. Their attack became even stronger, and Zhuang Jifang immediately made a significant contribution, giving Ge Lian the lead again. However, Liu Guocai eventually scored again, tying the score at 2-2. At that time, the atmosphere was intense. Ge Lian played a clever move, and Zhou Kecheng's final shot secured the victory, defeating Jingxiang 3-2.

### A Fair Discussion on Capital Increase of Industrial and Commercial Enterprises

— Xia Gaobo

I. Introduction

Recently, newspaper articles have frequently reported on announcements of general meetings of various limited companies. As a general rule, the discussions at this time are nothing more than (1) directors' reports on accounts, requesting approval from the general meeting of shareholders, (2) resolutions on the distribution of profits and dividends, and (3) re-election of directors and supervisors (refer to Articles 168, 136, 138, 152, and 154 of the Company Law). However, at the general meetings of various companies today, the issue of "capital increase" is often discussed. Capital increase is closely related to the credit and financial strength of a company. Therefore, our Company Law stipulates that it must be done through a "special resolution" (Article 186, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law). Moreover, after a company increases its capital, it also has an impact on national tax revenue (detailed later). This is related to national economic prosperity and should not be taken lightly. Recently, the trend of capital increase among Shanghai merchants (not limited to company organizations) has been very strong. Whether this is appropriate is subject to various justifications. However, due to different perspectives, those who discuss it are inevitably biased. Therefore, I offer a fair discussion, hoping to seek corrections from relevant government authorities, experts, and scholars, and hoping that the industrial and commercial sectors will give it careful consideration. I would be most grateful.

II. Reasons for Support and Opposition

There are various opinions on whether capital increase is appropriate. Here, I select the legitimate ones and analyze them into two categories:

A. Reasons for supporting capital increase:

(1) Reducing Tax Payable: According to our country's income tax and excess profits tax, the tax rates are determined by the ratio of income to capital. Therefore, two companies with different capital amounts but the same income amount (net profit) still have different tax amounts. Companies with larger capital pay less tax, and companies with smaller capital pay more tax. If a company's capital is small, but its surplus, reserves, and secret or discretionary public reserves are substantial, then the actual capital of the two companies is almost the same. It can be seen that the different tax payments are clearly unfair. Therefore, companies with smaller capital may wish to transfer their public reserves, etc., into capital to avoid this kind of loss. Therefore, capital increase cannot be opposed.

(2) High Costs Require Urgent Capital Increase: Prices are soaring, costs are high, and the original capital is insufficient for turnover. Therefore, capital increase is needed to seek business development.

(3) Stopping Dividend Payments to Increase Utility: Recently, due to the special market conditions, this year's profits have been exceptionally high. After distribution to shareholders, they often lead to wasteful spending. If dividend payments are stopped (or reduced) and converted into funds for business expansion, it is naturally very appropriate. Moreover, sufficient capital will lead to more future profits. Therefore, from the perspective of absolute numerical value, it can increase national tax revenue. Capital increase can certainly be agreed upon.

B. Reasons for opposing capital increase:

(1) Increasing Capital is Tantamount to Tax Evasion: This can be understood by referring to point one in section A.

(2) Surplus Funds Encourage Speculation: After funds are abundant, at a time when prices are constantly changing and uncertain, it is enough to encourage speculation and fluctuate price increases. Therefore, capital increase indirectly affects people's livelihood and is not appropriate.

(3) Capital Increase Inhibits the Internal Transfer of Funds: Shanghai's local environment is special. From a long-term perspective, funds should be transferred internally to consolidate inland finance and develop inland industries. Therefore, capital increase by Shanghai merchants is not appropriate.

III. Author's Fair Discussion

The above reasons for and against are equally strong. However, we should have a supreme principle as the basis for fair discussion. What is the principle? That is, the motivation for capital increase. Any capital increase intended for tax evasion or for non-business speculation is unacceptable. Any capital increase that seeks capital turnover for legitimate business needs is permissible. This principle may be too abstract. Now, let's discuss the methods of capital increase separately.

There are three ways to increase capital: actual capital increase, transfer capital increase, and passive capital increase. Their complexity varies. A separate discussion follows:

A. Actual Capital Increase: Actual capital increase is the real increase of funds in practice. In other words, it refers to the real receipt of cash or other assets to increase capital. For those who increase capital in this way, we generally cannot easily oppose it on the grounds of "tax evasion." Since there is an actual capital increase, the actual invested assets are indeed higher than in the previous year. How can it be falsely accused of tax evasion? However, I believe that the increase should be within a considerable proportion, that is, it should be proportional to the recent trend of business growth and adapt to the increase in the price index. If it exceeds this limit greatly, it is obvious that there is a suspicion of concurrently engaging in speculation, hoping for illegitimate profits, which is not something we can condone.

B. Transfer Capital Increase: Transfer capital increase does not actually increase funds; it only transfers surplus, etc., to capital. Therefore, the company's capital net worth (the remaining amount after deducting liabilities from assets) does not increase. Whether transfer capital increase is appropriate depends on the different transfer methods. Now, let's briefly discuss the main points.

(1) Transferring Discretionary Public Reserves and Reserves to Capital: Discretionary public reserves refer to public reserves other than statutory public reserves, and various reserves refer to reserves that have no external contractual relationship. The result of transferring them to capital does not increase the net worth of the capital, and this capital has actually been used in the enterprise in the past. Therefore, accountants often call it "reinvestment of net profit." Its transfer to capital is still a reinvestment of net profit, but it is legally considered capital. There is absolutely no increase or decrease in the company's financial strength, fund utilization, or profitability (if the company returns cash to some shareholders who are unwilling to transfer surplus to share capital, it will reduce the net worth of the capital). It can be seen that the purpose of its capital increase is obviously not legitimate, and there is no doubt that it is for tax evasion. Therefore, how can this kind of capital increase be supported? The inferiority of the motivation and the shamelessness of the means are self-evident.

(2) Transferring Current Year's Surplus to Capital: Recently, due to the special environment and abnormal price fluctuations, industrial and commercial enterprises have made huge profits in the 28th year of the Republic. Some manufacturers have bonuses of up to 100 months, and the thickness of their profits is amazing. Therefore, ambitious entrepreneurs are thinking of transferring the current year's surplus (except for the statutory tax payment and reserve appropriation) to capital and have legitimate reasons to defend it (see section II of this article). Whether this method can be agreed upon, in my humble opinion, cannot be determined on one side. It should be determined by whether the company really needs funds. If the company distributes the surplus to shareholders and expects to suffer from insufficient capital turnover this year, and the expansion of the business will be restricted, it may wish to transfer it to capital in accordance with the law to meet the needs. When the profit differs too much from the past, even if all accounting techniques are used to handle it prudently (this is an accounting issue. I have written an article on "Conservatism in Accounting," published in the second issue of the Fudan University Accounting Society Journal, which can be consulted), it is difficult to retain it, and it is easy to be criticized by shareholders. Therefore, it is only possible to be open and honest and make a proposal for capital increase. If the company does not need to increase funds, then transferring to capital is not appropriate.

(3) Capitalizing Revaluation Appreciation of Assets and Publicizing Secret Surplus: In general, enterprises often adopt prudent methods in accounting, underestimating fixed assets or setting up secret surplus invisibly through various methods. Now, fixed assets are valued by type (it must be estimated high), and secret surplus is made public, and the appreciation part is transferred to capital. Today, prices are rising sharply. If fixed assets are revalued according to the accounting theory of replacement cost, the appreciation amount will be very alarming. Today's price increase is due to the war and is quite different from the natural trend of gradual increase on weekdays. Therefore, whether the revaluation of fixed assets today is appropriate in economic accounting theory seems to be questionable. Therefore, it is also quite questionable to transfer asset valuation appreciation to capital, and we dare not condone it. Secret surplus is actually the undistributed surplus of previous years, so it can be referred to as described in the first type of transfer capital increase. However, the setting of secret surplus often lacks accurate calculation, so it is often more difficult to measure when it is made public. If it is inadvertently overestimated, the harm will be great, so it should be doubly cautious.

C. Passive Capital Increase: Passive capital increase is to reduce debt to increase capital. In other words, the company's creditors transfer their claims (that is, the company's debt) to shares. Therefore, it is also the nature of transfer capital increase. However, the result of passive capital increase can increase the net worth of capital, so I do not make it one of the transfer capital increase to show this biggest difference. Whether passive capital increase is appropriate should be judged by whether this debt is necessary. If this debt is necessary for business and is indispensable to maintain or expand business, then it is justifiable to simply transfer it to capital. On the contrary, if this debt is not necessary for business and can be repaid, but it is transferred to capital, the motivation is suspected, and the capital increase may not be appropriate.

IV. Conclusion

The above points are nothing more than an elucidation of the highest principle, that is, any capital increase intended for tax evasion or for non-business speculation is unacceptable. Any capital increase that seeks capital turnover for legitimate business needs is permissible. Although the discussion is based on limited companies, other business organizations have simpler capital increase methods, so the previous discussion can be applied by analogy without separate explanation. Whether the fair discussion is unbiased and whether the argument is free from error, I hope that readers will correct it.

### Surging Labor Unrest in Japan

### A Word to the Financial Community in Shanghai

— Lv Renyi

Prices in Shanghai are soaring, setting an unprecedented record. In particular, daily necessities such as rice, flour, and coal balls are the worst. Recently, I read the Municipal Council's published price index, which is several times higher than before the war. A few skilled businessmen know how to use this extraordinary period to speculate, hoard, and monopolize, making huge profits and rejoicing. However, the vast majority of law-abiding salaried class are severely oppressed by prices and feel that their income cannot cover their expenses, causing economic panic. The reason for this is that the increase in salaries is limited, and the rise in prices is endless. It is difficult for general household income and expenditure to balance, causing concern. The concession authorities, in view of this, have already set price limits for these daily necessities and tried to curb the price increase in order to relieve the people's difficulties. However, general merchants are eager for profit and disregard the people's livelihood, reversing their positions and designing to avoid price limits, and have not been able to comply. For example, the price limit for rice has been raised from 20 yuan to 30 yuan, and then to 40 yuan, following the market price. It has not been heard that the limit has achieved much effect. Recently, the concession authorities have ordered all stores to mark the prices of retail daily necessities, in order to encourage the stores to automatically suppress and flatten prices. The promulgation of this measure shows the authorities' deep concern for the people and their desire to save the people from the water and fire.

There are many commentators on curbing the rise in prices! However, the points of their arguments are all to directly restrict merchants from hoarding and to dredge the sources of production areas. However, we must know that relying solely on the authority of the authorities to restrict hoarding may not be very effective. As for dredging the sources of production areas, the Shanghai concession is in fact surrounded by the occupied area. Most of the daily necessities are supplied by the occupied area, which cannot be dredged by the power of our government and the concession authorities. Although the recent action of the People's Food Adjustment Committee to raise funds to purchase foreign rice can indeed prevent the rice price from continuing to rise for a while, it is indeed a good policy. However, there seems to be no way to dredge the sources of other goods. I think that the way to suppress and flatten prices, in addition to the above methods, if economic power can be used to implement control, the effect may be more significant. Financial resources are the lifeblood of business. If the financial community can cooperate fully, handle the acceptance of mortgages carefully, stipulate a method of mortgage release separately, and limit its scope, then the financial resources of ordinary merchants are ultimately limited, and the abuse of speculation and manipulation can be expected to be considerably curbed. According to the statistics published in the recent newspaper, the financial community in Shanghai has funds of 200 billion yuan. Various Chinese and foreign banks have always been leaders in the business world. Now that they have such a huge amount of funds, if they can set an example and not engage in hoarding and speculation, and help the authorities to strictly prevent speculators from using their funds for hoarding, then the price increase in Shanghai may be considerably curbed! Now, I will describe my views below for the reference of the financial community in Shanghai.

### Market Knowledge Consultant Column - Announcement

We have recently received many market knowledge questions, which will be answered together in the next issue of this publication. We acknowledge your interest and thank you in advance.

(1) Do Not Provide Foreign Exchange Margin Loans: Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have a significant impact on commodity prices! At first glance, foreign exchange rates seem to only affect the prices of foreign goods. We might think that if we are determined not to use foreign goods, we can avoid its influence. However, anyone with a basic understanding of economics knows that this is not the case. Foreign exchange rates are closely related to the prices of all goods, especially those involved in international trade! Take tea and eggs, for example... The annual export volume of these items is substantial. Businesses in this sector will undoubtedly export large quantities during times of rapid foreign exchange depreciation to profit from exchange rate differences. At the same time, the prices of these goods sold domestically will also rise! Even for domestic goods unrelated to international trade, those who usually admire imported goods will now, due to economic constraints, have to lower their standards and buy domestic goods as substitutes. The market prices of domestic goods will naturally rise as well. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are indeed closely related to changes in commodity prices. If we can control the exchange rate, commodity prices will naturally stabilize! Although the government has long implemented controls on foreign exchange rates, the special environment in Shanghai makes it difficult to enforce the law, and the black market still manipulates it. Therefore, what we want to study is how to suppress and stabilize the exchange rate. If banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, as well as major foreign banks such as HSBC, Citibank, and Mercantile Bank, all stop providing foreign exchange margin loans (i.e., do not provide margin loans for foreign exchange bills and foreign currency banknotes), then merchants who usually speculate in foreign exchange will only be able to purchase foreign exchange with their own capital. This would reduce the demand for foreign exchange, and its price would naturally fall, causing commodity prices to decline as well. HSBC once announced that it would no longer provide margin loans for gold and foreign exchange, and the foreign exchange market immediately weakened. This shows that the actions of one bank alone can significantly affect the foreign exchange market. If all Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai uniformly stop providing foreign exchange margin loans and work together to control the situation, it will be easier to suppress and stabilize the exchange rate, and commodity prices will gradually become more stable!

(2) Do Not Provide Long-Term Margin Loans for Essential Daily Necessities: …If all Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai do not provide long-term margin loans for essential daily necessities such as rice, flour, and coal briquettes, businesses in these sectors, due to limited financial resources, will find it difficult to hoard goods for long periods and monopolize the market. The decline in their market prices will naturally be gradually achieved.

(3) Increase Warehouse Rental Rates: – Most of the larger banks in Shanghai have their own warehouses to benefit customers. According to common practice, borrowers take out margin loans from banks using commodities as collateral and store the commodities in the bank's warehouses while waiting for favorable prices to sell. Banks, on the other hand, welcome borrowers to store collateral in their own warehouses because external margin loans are unreliable. If banks stipulate higher warehouse rental rates and limit rental periods for daily necessities such as rice, flour, and coal briquettes, merchants will not be able to hoard goods! Merchants hoard goods only as a temporary expedient and will not rent additional space specifically for this purpose. Therefore, merchants will not hoard goods if we treat bank warehouses as a key point. If banks announce higher warehouse rental rates and limit rental periods, merchants who want to hoard and speculate will inevitably hesitate. This is also a way to suppress commodity prices.

If Shanghai banks can lead by example, refrain from speculation, earnestly guide the real economy, and study and implement the above-mentioned methods to reduce margin loans for daily necessities and foreign exchange as much as possible within their capabilities and increase warehouse rental rates, it may be possible to achieve a significant effect on suppressing commodity prices. As for investment strategies, we hope that all banks can consider using their surplus funds to invest in construction projects in the southwestern provinces. This will prevent large amounts of capital from being idled and generate considerable profits, while also assisting the government in completing its major anti-Japanese war construction plan. This is what we deeply hope for!

### Cost Estimate for Ten-Pound Coarse Cloth

— Long Ju Sheng

Most Chinese-owned textile factories have unfortunately been destroyed in the war, and those that have miraculously survived have been seized by the enemy! Since the Chinese army withdrew from "Greater Shanghai," Shanghai has been recognized as an isolated island, fortunate enough to enjoy a distorted prosperity, a paradise for adventurers? Merchants who are skilled at speculation will not easily let this opportunity pass. Therefore, after the war, "small textile factories" in Shanghai have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Most of them weave coarse cloth (grey fabric), such as nine-pound, ten-pound, eleven-pound, twelve-pound, and thirteen-pound coarse cloths, fine plain cloths, and twelve-pound coarse and fine twills. The cost calculation is generally based on the ten-pound coarse plain cloth as the standard. Before the war, the raw material cost (yarn cost) of one bolt of ten-pound coarse plain cloth was only about four yuan and forty cents, but now it costs about sixteen yuan! As for the production cost (manufacturing cost, management cost, unified tax, etc.) per bolt, it was no more than one yuan and twelve cents before the war, but now it costs at least three to four yuan! Among these, the increase in materials, electricity, and coal is the most severe! In terms of market prices, one bolt of ten-pound coarse plain cloth sold for about six yuan before the war, but now it must sell for twenty-two yuan and fifty cents. The selling price is almost three times higher than before the war. How can ordinary people afford it? The following is a list of the cost estimates for ten-pound cloth before and after the war, along with the percentage increase:

The raw material (yarn cost) of the above-mentioned ten-pound coarse plain cloth is generally made of ten-count yarn for the warp and twelve-count yarn for the weft. In 1936, the selling price of ten-count coarse yarn was no more than 180 yuan (per piece), and the selling price of twelve-count coarse yarn was only 190 yuan. So, after removing the selling price of ten-count yarn from a piece of yarn weighing 420 pounds (Sima weight), each pound only cost 0.485 yuan. And after removing the selling price of twelve-count yarn, each pound only cost 0.4524 yuan. The average was only 0.440 yuan (per pound of yarn cost), right? Even if ten pounds of yarn were used (in terms of engineering, ten-pound coarse plain cloth generally uses nine and a half pounds of yarn, and at most ten pounds. After removing half a pound of by-products, the pure weaving yarn is still nine and a half pounds, right? But for the sake of calculating yarn costs, it must be calculated as ten pounds), a yarn cost of four yuan and forty cents was enough. But now, a piece of ten-count yarn costs 680 yuan, which is equivalent to 1.62 yuan per pound. A piece of twelve-count yarn costs 710 yuan, which is equivalent to 1.69 yuan per pound. The average calculation is 1.655 yuan per pound. Multiplying this by nine and a half pounds of yarn, isn't the cost (per bolt of yarn) 15 yuan and 67 cents? According to the above table, the total cost of one bolt of ten-pound coarse plain cloth (now) is 19.76 yuan, and the market price is 22.50 yuan. Adding the two cents per bolt of by-products (scraps) produced, the total is 22.70 yuan. After deducting the cost of 19.76 yuan, the factory's profit per bolt is as high as 2.94 yuan! (Before the war, it was only a small profit, at most six or seven cents.) If the daily and nightly production capacity is 1,000 bolts, wouldn't the daily net profit be 2,940 yuan? Taking a step back, even if the production volume of a small textile factory is as little as 100 bolts, there is still a profit of nearly 300 yuan a day, which is also very considerable, right? What needs to be pointed out here is that Japanese yarn has now reached parity with domestic yarn (and sometimes even exceeds the price of domestic yarn). There are no longer any cheap goods! Therefore, those profiteering manufacturers who used to buy Japanese yarn are now switching to purchasing domestic yarn as raw materials because the yarn costs are similar (Japanese yarn and "domestic yarn"), and they are afraid of problems in the domestic sales market. This is good news! It's also a good phenomenon! I hope it can remain so permanently!

Note: The yarn used for one ten-pound coarse plain cloth (per bolt) is 9.50 pounds, and the starch is 1.50 pounds, for a total weight of 11 pounds. As for the cloth weight, it is 10.50 pounds, and the by-product is 0.50 pounds (half a pound, the total is also 11 pounds, those who read this should know.")

### Diao Qing Rises by One Yuan

According to a telegram from the Netherlands yesterday, the sugar market has rebounded by 1 cent. The C.I.F.K.G. is valued at 9.00 Dutch guilders. The local association's market price is tight. Spot 24 coarse white, 65 yuan at this warehouse, up 2 cents. No change in new goods at external warehouses, at 64 yuan and 65 to 7 cents, old goods 64 yuan and 50 cents, transit 51 yuan and 40 cents.

### Quanzhou Round Costs are High

Quanzhou Pao Yuan, it is heard that the Xinxiangtai ship will arrive soon, with a small number of shipments. According to a letter from a customer, the cost of this top round must be 140 yuan per dan, which is expensive and unprecedented. According to the Shanghai market, it is currently difficult to reach.

### Lily Slice Costs are High

New lily slices are expected to be sampled by the end of May. Because of the transition between new and old, production and storage are scarce, and the price is also high. The cost is more than 40 yuan, but the Shanghai market is still difficult to see good. It is heard that the Guangzhou gang handled a batch of ordinary goods yesterday for 31 to 32 yuan. If the high-end is 435 yuan, the goods are extremely scarce, so customers with a little stock are unwilling to sell cheaply and look forward to a firm price.

### Red Qians Fall by Six or Seven Yuan

Red-skinned Qianshi, also known as Yaoqian, has recently seen a surge in sources from Jiangbei, and the underlying inventory is quite abundant, but the forward market is sluggish, so the market is downstream. It is heard that the transaction yesterday fell by six or seven yuan, but some customers are losing money, so the future sources will be reduced, and the overall trend is expected to bottom out.

### Domestically Produced Xiawei is Lacking

Domestically produced shrimp tails, such as Tianjin, Yantai, Wenzhou, and Jiangbei, are all lacking in supply, so transactions are quiet. The market inventory is low, and the trend is also flat. This is because inferior goods are full, and street sales are not lacking. It is heard that the current market price of Yuanwei is 240 yuan to 250 yuan, and Bianwei is 290 yuan.

### Pepper Market Turns Better

The arrival of pepper is continuous, and the forward market is said to be bad. The underlying inventory of black pepper is rare, and the current market price of black pepper is 102 yuan, which is 4 yuan higher than before. Wen Dao white pepper is still 175 yuan, and Dutch goods are 165 yuan, and the trend is also stable.

### Paper-Wrapped Company Iron - Delivery is Smooth

Paper-wrapped Company Iron is a new product from the United States. It has not been sold in Shanghai for a long time, and it has been loved by manufacturers. The reason is that it is excellent in material and dazzling in color, and the price is slightly higher than Company Iron, but it is much lower than tinplate. Therefore, can factories, toy factories, printing factories, cigarette factories, thermos factories, and biscuit companies have a lot of purchases, especially can factories. It is heard that in the past two days, the transaction volume in the market was as high as five or six hundred boxes, so the industry is thinking of keeping up with its strength. In addition, there are no goods from Europe these days, even if there are one or two, they have been intercepted on the way, so the arrival of goods in Shanghai is very thin. Although the United States is not within the scope of the European war, the recent situation in the Pacific is tight, transportation will be more difficult, and sources will be sharply reduced, so the inventory in Shanghai is in danger of imbalance between supply and demand, and the asking price is getting higher and higher. The current market price is 170 yuan per box (2 bundles calculated at 200 pounds), which is 5 yuan better than before.

### Coal Briquettes Continue to Add Seven Yuan - Seven Yuan and Forty Cents Per Dan

In terms of coal briquettes, due to the soaring price of raw material Hongji No. 2 chips (150 yuan per ton), which is related to the cost, the industry association has decided that the Yitai Xing, Nanyang, and Guohua coal briquettes will continue to add 7 yuan from now on. The price is 135 yuan per ton by car, 139 yuan for delivery, 18 yuan and 5 cents per basket at the door retail, and 7 yuan and 4 cents per 100 city catties, including delivery costs.

### Inside Story of Coal Merchants' Manipulation

The coal market has recently been affected by the expansion of the European war. Generally, coal merchants say that the inventory in the city is weak, and the Norwegian delivery of transported goods has been reported to be detained, and the source will be cut off. Under this name, various grades of Yanbai coal have been raised to 30 or 40 yuan per ton in one week. Those who hoard goods still want to see good, hold back and do not release, and on the other hand, they take the opportunity to spread rumors to shake people's hearts. For example, a certain bank restricts the dismantling of the same industry, each household is limited to two baskets, making people panic, and the dark price is rising day by day. In fact, there are still more than 10,000 tons of Hongji white coal in its warehouse, hoarding and manipulating the market. If it is afraid of being criticized, it urges customers to come and deliver the goods quickly. To explore its content, this so-called warehouse list stopped selling two months ago, and it is impossible to know why it made this statement. It is nothing more than to make the outside world unclear about the truth, confusing the news. Other white coals such as Haifeng Mark Kaibao, bituminous coal such as Indian Calcutta, Borneo, Kaiping, etc., are stocked in each warehouse, no less than 100,000 tons, and a certain side's coal is not included, which is enough for the city to supply for three months. What is the so-called weak inventory? As for the obstruction of transportation and the disconnection of sources, it is even more nonsense. Because in addition to Norway and Denmark, there are also British-owned Maler Wheels, Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, and Dala Wheels, etc., accounting for more than 70%, which is enough to supply. Even those who can arrive within this week have as many as 35,000 tons. In May, there have been several orders, so in the shortest period, if there are no unexpected changes, the source of goods will not be a problem. However, at present, the first order is not reduced, the US dollar hovers at 6 yuan, the cost of foreign coal has not changed, and the market price is rising from it, nothing more than to "fish in troubled waters," so it is a dangerous word, frightening the public. If the European war is slightly eased, the market price will fall by itself. It is seen that general speculators "climb high and fall hard." It is very dangerous. I hope that all circles will deal with it calmly, adapt to changes, do not rashly advance, so as to avoid "carrying a stone slab and pressing on your feet," wanting to be cheap but suffering a loss.

### Sexual Health - Reasonable Conditioning and Effective Treatment for Middle-Aged Kidney Deficiency and Brain Weakness

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Why do middle-aged people develop symptoms such as kidney deficiency and brain weakness? In short, this is due to the excessive consumption of essence and blood during youth. If you indulge in lust and debauchery in your youth, or have bad habits of masturbation, the above two symptoms will be unavoidable in middle age. In addition, poor environment, excessive use of the brain, and excessive labor will also cause huge consumption of physical strength, and the above two symptoms will also occur after middle age. The method of treatment lies in reasonable conditioning, do not work too hard, sexual life should also be restrained, take in nutritious food, pay attention to exercise, do not smoke alcohol and other products. Then engage in sperm enhancement and blood replenishing therapy to achieve the purpose of rejuvenation and restore youthful vitality.

The method of rejuvenation was prevalent in ancient times, but although the ancients sought it day and night, they still could not get what they wanted. Why is this? This is nothing more than the ancients being too focused on superstition and unwilling to study it based on scientific principles.

Now, based on the facts of many experiments with scientific basis, it is believed that the method of immortality must use endocrinology knowledge to be more prosperous. Because modern endocrinology can only alleviate aging, scholars still need to work hard to return to childhood.

The disease of kidney deficiency and brain weakness in middle-aged people is indeed caused by premature aging. The treatment method must be to take male "Boutikang," a majestic animal endocrine preparation invented by Dr. Mullin in Germany, because "Boutikang" is completely extracted from the sperm of chimpanzees, cattle, sheep, stags, and seals. Suppose that if you suffer from kidney deficiency, brain weakness, etc. due to overwork or debauchery, and then invest in "Boutikang," you will immediately feel the prosperity of sexuality, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, waist back pain and other symptoms will be cured in a few days.

In addition to the testicular essence of the kind, "Boutikang" also contains brain-nourishing phosphorus, blood-nourishing iron, and bone-nourishing calcium, which can cure any part of the body that is weak. If a person under the age of 40 feels insufficient sperm, pale complexion, neurasthenia, thin muscles, and lack of energy in doing things, it is a clear sign of premature aging, then taking "Boutikang" internally is the most reasonable treatment method, and its female use has the effect of regulating menstruation and seeding, and treating anemia and premature aging is especially symptomatic.

### Case of Cured Spermatorrhea

— Dr. Wan Naiqiang, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

The patient, Zhao Changming, is 24 years old and from Shandong. (Self-reported) - When he was 16 years old, when his love was just beginning, countless erotic books and paintings were collected and appreciated early and late, and even erotic thoughts were frequent day and night. Fortunately, he was as timid as a mouse and dared not openly play outside. Later, he was led by bad friends, and he became addicted to self-pleasuring, because the habit became natural, almost every night, he would commit it once, and soon felt dazed, and had more dreams. After the age of 21, he suddenly felt gaunt, insufficient spirit, at that time, he had a little medical knowledge, knowing that it must endanger the whole body, resolutely abstained, but spermatorrhea has been frequent and incessant, first only four or five days a month, and later reached about ten times. Because I have been unemployed for a long time, I have no money to see a doctor, which has led to letting it go untreated, and the disease has increased. Recently, the memory is weak, the eyes are dizzy, the waist back is painful, and the face development has been blocked. Recently, because the wedding date is approaching, I beg for treatment. (Treatment process) - First, "Naimian" was used in conjunction with electrotherapy to restore the prosperity of sexual nerves. After three months of treatment, spermatorrhea disappeared, the body recovered, the development was sufficient, and the weight also increased by 12 pounds, and there is a tendency to continue to gain weight.

### Gonorrhea Lecture - Failure of Gonorrhea Treatment with Inferior Drugs

— Dr. Yao Juyan said

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Using compulsory methods to subdue the object you want to subdue will cause problems in 19 out of 10 cases. Because nothing in the world can be suppressed by violent force. Even if it is subdued for a while, it will eventually erupt one day. In my 20 years of experience, most of the patients who unfortunately suffer from gonorrhea are not originally stubborn roots of the disease. However, the reason why all kinds of symptoms eventually change is that they are caused by compulsory drugs. Among the various complications of gonorrhea, prostatitis, orchitis, and arthritis are the most common. These complications are mostly caused by inferior industries. And poor local surgery is also more likely to turn into such terrible complications. You must know that the urethra is composed of the corpus cavernosum. And it is rich in blood vessels. If gonorrhea has entered the corpus cavernosum from the mucosa of the posterior urethra, then the general over-the-counter drugs on the market that advocate film-penetrating sterilization, or use local washing methods, want to completely eliminate all the gonorrhea in the blood and the corpus cavernosum, which is tantamount to fishing for the moon in the water, which is hoped for but cannot be reached. And because these treatments are useless and harmful. It is advisable to stop these treatments as soon as possible. If you are lost and do not know how to return, then this kind of patient will inevitably suffer thousands of changes. It is even more difficult to clean up.

Therefore, it is best to treat it with excellent scientific methods. Only then can the purpose of full recovery be achieved. To achieve this goal, the gonorrhea panacea "Kerlinong" (available at China-UK Pharmacy) is the most ideal internal medicine for gonorrhea patients. Because "Kerlinong" has the effect of stimulating the body's cells to fight gonorrhea. So that gonorrhea has no way to escape. At the same time, based on my experience, I also use German inductive static electricity therapy and German anti-gonorrhea serum as a supplement, so that all new and old gonorrhea can be completely cured. Absolutely do not disappoint the patient. Because these treatments have extremely thorough and gentle sterilization power. It is different from the compulsory treatment of gonorrhea.

Clinic hours: 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. 20 consultations are sent out every day, and only 5 cents of the consultation fee is charged for each number, and a copy of "The Complete Book of Sexual Diseases" is given away.

### Modern Medicine: Ironclad Facts - Gonorrhea Drug Experiment

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Many old gonorrhea treatments have been proven ineffective by modern expert physicians and patients. Therefore, research into new treatments is flourishing within the entire medical community. Scholars are working diligently, exhausting countless efforts and brainpower, and finally, a truth for treating gonorrhea was discovered in a test tube, which shocked the medical world. It is widely regarded as the greatest achievement in the treatment of gonorrhea. At that time, I was studying medicine in America, focusing on research and extensively reading medical journals published in Europe and America. I learned that the new method is based on the latest science, extracting pure pigments and protein complexes, combined with other mild but powerful antibacterial chemicals, to create a rinsing solution. When this solution is used to soak gonococci, the gonococci are quickly killed.

Many scholars, such as Dr. Jauregg (1912), R. Kraug (1914, 1717), and R. Schmidt (1916), all university professors and specialists in gonorrhea, have repeatedly tested the agent and proved its great effectiveness. Gonococci cultured on agar slants in test tubes are usually very active and lively. However, once this drug solution is injected into the test tube, all the gonococci immediately die. Later, Dr. Peter further improved the method by using precise sterilization procedures to make a oral medicine called "Kelinong" (available at the China-England Dispensary) from pure yellow pigment and specially prepared protein complexes, opening a new era in the treatment of gonorrhea.

This medicine has the function of radically curing all types of gonorrhea in men and women, whether acute or chronic, such as acute and chronic balanitis, prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, arthritis in men, vulvitis, vaginitis, cervicitis, oophoritis, gonorrheal leukorrhea in women. Its effectiveness is swift and accurate, and its reputation has long been established. For women with gonorrheal leukorrhea, "Carters vaginal suppositories" can be used externally as suppositories. Insert one tablet into the vagina every night before going to bed and wash it away the next morning. Men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" externally to wash the urethra according to the diagram and instructions, secretly treating themselves at home. The speed of effectiveness will exceed expectations and may be even better than treatment at a general doctor's office. This is the conclusion I have reached from my clinical experience over the past decade. (Note: "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution" is sold at both Taihe Chinese and Western Drugstores)

### Secret for Cough Relief and Lung Treatment - Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Whether in traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine, cough is considered a difficult condition to treat. Therefore, lung diseases are far more common than any other infectious disease, and their mortality rate is truly alarming. Therefore, people should not regard a cough caused by a cold as a minor ailment and neglect treatment. If, unfortunately, a cough becomes a lung disease due to neglect, the patient should not be pessimistic. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as general doctors say. As long as one takes care of their health and receives proper treatment, there is nothing mysterious about it. Based on my experience, the medicine "Bufei Na'er" has a very effective cough-relieving and lung-curing effect. Even in the second or third stage of hemoptysis, taking this medicine can achieve a complete cure. However, during the recovery period, one should rest quietly, avoid labor, and consume nutritious foods. Then the disease can be more easily cured. These are the essential conditions for curing pulmonary tuberculosis.

### Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Frederick Maze, Defends Customs Rights, Resolves Not to Interact with "Customs Administration" - British and American Officials and Businessmen Will Provide Strong Support

According to reliable sources from well-informed foreigners, the diplomatic authorities of Britain, America, and other third countries in Shanghai, as well as influential businessmen, are paying serious attention to the issue of the Jianghai Customs. It is said that the "Customs Administration" of the Nanjing regime, fearing Zhang Sumin's so-called "assumption of office," sent an informal document to the Shanghai office of the Inspectorate General of Customs on Hed Road in Shanghai, notifying the Inspector General, Mr. Frederick Maze.

The intention is clearly visible.

Since the outbreak of the war, Mr. Maze has been stationed in Shanghai, and all customs offices throughout the country are under the jurisdiction of the Inspector General. In the past, the Japanese puppet regime, with its watchful eyes, focused all its attention on the Jianghai Customs but never interacted with the Inspector General. Although Zhang Sumin notified his so-called "assumption of office" with an informal "official document" this time, his significant ambition to covet the Shanghai office of the Inspectorate General and undermine customs rights is clearly evident.

Customs Inspector Maze ignored it.

If the Inspectorate General were unfortunately to undergo any changes, it would not only affect the trade of Britain, America, and other third countries with China but also have a significant impact on the foreign debt secured by customs revenue. Therefore, it has aroused great concern among officials and businessmen from third countries. However, Inspector General Frederick Maze ignored this document and refused to acknowledge it. Historical circumstances of the Jianghai Customs have undergone many changes, and its negotiating counterpart has always been the Japanese side. Therefore, foreign businessmen here believe that in order to protect their original rights and interests in trade with China, the governments of Britain, America, and other countries should promptly provide strong support to Inspector General Frederick Maze to prepare for future developments.

### The New French Military Commander Has Already Assumed Office

After Colonel Gascoigne, the former commander of the French garrison, who had a long and distinguished military career, was recalled to his country, the new garrison commander, Major-General Hélouis, officially took office on the 17th. His background is as follows: Major-General Hélouis is 49 years old, born on April 11, 1891. He joined the army on October 8, 1912. When the European War broke out in 1914, Major-General Hélouis served in the 23rd Regiment of the Albert Light Infantry. Not long after fighting,

he was slightly injured.

In 1914, he was appointed Second Lieutenant and platoon leader, and then promoted to company commander. He fought in various places in Lorraine and Belgium. At the beginning of 1915, he was injured for the second time and received commendation from the division headquarters. In May of the same year, he was promoted to Lieutenant and participated in battles in "Verdun," "Somme," and Champagne. In 1916, he was sent to Italy to assist in the battles in "Doberdo" and "Monte Forno" mountains. Then he was transferred back to Belgium "Somme". On October 8, 1916,

he led his team in a charge,

capturing the enemy's position and machine guns. Major-General Hélouis was also injured in this battle and was highly praised by the military. In November 1918, he was discharged from the hospital after recovering from his injuries and was sent to the Rhineland, where he served in the staff offices of the 3rd and 46th Anti-Aircraft Battalions. In 1920, he went to French Guinea in French Africa. Later, he returned to France and served in the 8th and 23rd Brigades of the Colonial Infantry, and also served as a messenger for the Colonial Department. In August 1924, he went to Annam and served as the Battalion Commander of the 5th Military Region.

He made many constructions

concerning traffic within the region. In May 1928, he returned to France. In December of the same year, he was appointed Colonel and served in the Colonial Shooting Brigade in West Africa. Later, he served as an instructor in the infantry and tank departments of the military academy preparatory class. In November 1933, he returned to Annam again and served in the 10th Mixed Brigade of the Colonial Infantry. Then he returned to France and assisted in the design of military preparations in the staff office of the Colonial Infantry, and trained reserve officers in the Paris region. In August 1939, Major-General Hélouis

returned to Annam again.

This was Major-General Hélouis's third visit to Vietnam, serving as the commander of the 10th Mixed Brigade of the Colonial Infantry. In December 1939, he was promoted to Colonel. On March 28th of this year, he came to China by ship from Saigon to serve as the military commander. Major-General Hélouis was awarded the Cross of War Merit for his military achievements.

### China's Food Supply Can Be Self-Sufficient - War Zone Food Supplies No Longer Need to Rely on Foreign Countries

After the Chinese government made efforts to increase food production, land reclamation in various provinces has been actively carried out and has achieved great results. The harvest of rice, wheat, and other miscellaneous grains in the fourteen provinces of the war zone has increased by 4.6% compared to last year and 11.9% compared to the average of the past seven years. This is quite noteworthy. Therefore, the war zone can be self-sufficient in food supplies and no longer needs to rely on foreign countries.

### French Government Requisitions Ships - French Mail Temporarily Suspended - Ships from Nordic Countries Dock at Allied Ports - Norwegian Ships Cooperate with the British Navy in the Eastern Seas - Shanghai's Paper Inventory is Low, Panic is Expected

French mail ships operating on European and Far Eastern routes have had irregular schedules since the European War, averaging one decision every half month. According to shipping industry news, the French government has recently requisitioned commercial ships in Europe and the Far East due to the needs of the war. According to news from the French shipping company, various commercial ships will temporarily suspend operations on all routes due to the requisition orders. Therefore, mail ships coming to the Far East will temporarily suspend voyages to Shanghai for a period of one month or more. Operations will resume after the requisition is completed. As for a mail ship that departed from Marseille in early this month, it will arrive in Shanghai within the next week. This is said to be the last mail ship departing.

The impact of the war in Northern Europe on shipping

The Shanghai Times reported that after Norway and Denmark were drawn into the vortex of war, shipping in Shanghai has been severely affected. Most of the city's import and export goods are transported by ships from Denmark and Norway. However, at present, these ships have avoided docking at some Allied ports to ensure safety due to the threat of Germany. This point has been confirmed by the Danish, Norwegian, and Finnish consuls stationed in Shanghai.

Observations by the Consuls of the Three Countries in Shanghai

Danish Consul Mr. Hiller stated that no Danish ships would come to Shanghai in the future. There are currently no Danish ships remaining here, and no Danish ships will come to Shanghai until the war ends. Regarding Finnish ships, the statement issued by Finnish Consul Endner was the same as that of Mr. Hiller. Norwegian Consul Knyth also stated that Norwegian ships in the Eastern seas are currently cooperating with the British Navy. Norwegian ships in Shanghai have all sailed to Hong Kong. It is not yet known how long they will dock there. All Norwegian ships are now ordered to sail to Allied ports and do not dock at any neutral ports.

The future of shipping is highly doubtful.

So far, China's coastal trade has not been affected by the European War. However, according to a large shipping company in this city, although its large ships sailing to foreign countries are still continuing to operate, it is doubtful how long they can continue to operate under the current circumstances. The actions of British ships are very irregular and kept secret, so it is impossible to obtain information in advance. In addition, the Shanghai press will face a paper shortage because most of the newsprint is transported from the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula. At present, there is only enough stock in this city for three months, and some ships are urgently needed to continue transporting goods to Shanghai.

### Establishment of the People's Self-Strengthening Association - Unity of the Green and Red Gangs - National Government Sends Personnel to Guide - Sichuan Province Takes the Lead in Organizing

According to a Chongqing special dispatch published in the Chongqing Daily's weekly magazine yesterday, more than a thousand people participated in the establishment ceremony of the People's Self-Strengthening Association held in Chongqing last month. The organization was formed by uniting all the Qing and Hong Gang organizations within the four provinces. The government also sent special personnel to provide guidance. The persons in charge of the association were sworn into office, and representatives from various public organizations in the city also participated in the ceremony. According to the persons in charge, the association will actively assist the government authorities in evacuating the population from the war zones, maintaining order in the rear, and expanding the conscription movement and other military measures. There are 7 million members of such organizations within Sichuan Province. The establishment and development of the Hongmen and Qingbang sects has a history of more than 200 years. There are also branches overseas, that is, the "Three Harmonies Society," most of whose members are overseas Chinese. In the past, they made many contributions to the national revolutionary movement. The purpose of the members of the two sects is to awaken the people and restore the Han nationality. Therefore, both sides unite to serve the country. Now that the country is in crisis, they should further form a "united front." If the performance in Sichuan Province is excellent, other provinces will also follow suit. According to general statistics, there are 40 million male and female members of the two gangs in the country.

### British and American Ambassadors Will Not Return to Shanghai Recently - Their Stay in Chongqing Will Be Longer - They Know That Returning to Shanghai Can Easily Lead to the Spreading of Rumors by Some Parties

British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, went to Chongqing in December of last year, and it has been almost April. American Ambassador Dr. Johnson also arrived in Chongqing in mid-February of this year, and it has been more than two months. According to a visit by a reporter from the Pinyin News Agency to officials close to the British diplomatic head in Shanghai, the British ambassador will not return to Shanghai in the short term and will remain in Chongqing for at least two months. A visit to the U.S. Consulate General also revealed that there is no news of the American ambassador returning to Shanghai until recently. A reporter also learned from those familiar with foreign diplomatic circles in this city that the length of stay of the British and American ambassadors in Chongqing this time will be much longer than in the past because the two ambassadors do not want to be used to create rumors during this period. At the same time, the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, France, and other countries do not recognize the Nanjing "regime" and will refuse to have any contact with it when they come to Shanghai in the future.

### Commodity Prices Clearly Marked - Expected to be Implemented This Week - Sample Price Lists Have Been Distributed to Various Stores - Hope Merchants Cooperate to Compete on Fair Prices

The Shanghai Evening Post reported that the new regulations requiring stores to clearly mark prices were formulated by the authorities of the two concessions last week and should be implemented this week. It is expected that merchants will have sufficient preparation time by this week to comply with the new rules. When the reporter inquired about this matter from the municipal authorities, they said that these regulations, along with sample price lists, had been distributed to the owners of various stores in the two concessions, but the decision was made to

not urge them for the time being

because the authorities understand that it is quite cumbersome for store owners to comply with the regulations. According to the rules promulgated by the authorities of the two concessions, all stores are required to display price lists, and all goods must be clearly marked with prices so that customers can know the prices in advance. The authorities will also publish weekly reports listing the areas in the city where prices are the lowest, so that buyers can

choose to buy at lower prices.

Therefore, merchants are also willing to compete on fair prices. The committee planning the fair price program has discovered that setting maximum prices is impractical because most essential necessities are perishable and their prices depend on supply and demand.

### Population Statistics in the International Settlement - More Than 70,000 Foreigners - More Than 2 Million Chinese

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement has not conducted a new population survey since the 25th year. According to the announcement at that time, the number of foreigners residing within the Settlement and outside the Settlement along the Council's roads was 39,750, and the number of Chinese was 1,178,880. The Council recently conducted another survey, and the foreign population survey has been completed. The Chinese population survey has not yet been fully completed. According to the figures released by the Council, the number of foreigners residing within the International Settlement and outside the Settlement along the Council's roads is 71,915, an increase of 32,165 compared to the 25th year. The estimated number of Chinese is 1 million to 2.5 million, an increase of more than 1 million.

### Strictly Prohibit Gambling Among Refugees

Due to the significant harm caused to refugees by lottery gambling in the refugee shelters in the Nanshi District, a notice has been issued strictly prohibiting refugees from playing lottery games. The notice also states that anyone who violates the rules will be expelled from the shelter immediately upon discovery.

### Japanese Troops in Zhabei Moving Westward - Wounded Soldiers in Combat

On the former Jinghu and Huhang Railways, some Japanese army soldiers with minor injuries, with their heads, faces, hands, and feet wrapped in white cloth, and exhausted soldiers, after retreating to Shanghai, were stationed in various places such as the North Railway Station and Jiangwan. Recently, the Chinese guerrillas in western Shanghai threatened the Japanese army, so the above-mentioned Japanese army has been moving west to reinforce the area for several days. At present, all defenses (referring to Zhabei) are entirely undertaken by a small number of Japanese naval marines and Chinese police.

### Jewish Community in Shanghai Holds Passover Commemoration

Changing Food to Remind of Circumstances

More than 26,000 Jewish residents in Shanghai will hold the 3,252nd Passover commemoration in the synagogue on the 12th (today), praying for the coming of the Messiah (the religious leader revered by the Jewish people). The Jewish residents in the Hongkou district will build open-air prayer shelters. All Jewish people will change to eating unleavened bread to remind themselves of the difficulties and adversities they have suffered in the past and present.

### The Pseudo "Central Market" - Nanshi Branch Also Established - From Now On, There Will Be No Survivors of Local Goods Transported to Shanghai - The Official Opening Date Is Still Uncertain

The Nanshi branch of the pseudo "Central Market" was formally established the day before yesterday. Although the Japanese puppets have already begun to intercept local goods transported to Shanghai from Xujiahui and Pudong, the situation is extremely bleak due to the fact that the Tie Men Gate in Sixteen Pupu has not yet been opened and the local goods merchants have strongly refused to participate. The official opening date is still uncertain. The details are as follows:

Complete Control

The scope of the pseudo "Central Market" for intercepting local goods is the Jingning, Huhang railways and the Yangtze River ports. The Bailinan Road branch in Shanghai is in the Suzhou River area. Since the two "markets" opened one after another, local goods from the northwest of the city have been completely controlled. Only the local goods from Xujiahui and Pudong can be transported to Shanghai continuously, allowing the citizens to alleviate the suffering of exploitation, because the "Nanshi Branch" can be established. Now the "Nanshi Branch" has also been established, and the Japanese puppets have also started to control the local goods in Xujiahui and Pudong the day before yesterday. According to news from the local goods merchants, in the past three days, more than 1,000 loads of vegetables and other items transported to Shanghai by villagers in the above two places have been intercepted and forced to be bought at low prices. At this point, local goods in this city have been completely controlled, and the lives of citizens have become even more painful.

Bleak Scene

The "Central Market Branch" near the Ningshao Wharf in Nanshi was established. There was no ceremony at that time, only the interception of local goods began as a preparation for opening. The reporter went to Nanshi yesterday to inspect and saw that the "market" was located in a corner of Ningshao Wharf Road. The vegetable sheds were short and the equipment was simple. All around were the tall buildings of the past, but now there are only broken walls and ruins. The setting sun cast a sad light. Japanese puppet military police were standing in front of the "market" with guns, heavily guarded, so pedestrians turned away. Inside the "market", the courtyard was lonely and there were no people.

Opening Uncertain

The Japanese puppets regarded the opening of the Tie Men Gate in Sixteen Pupu as the only condition for the prosperity of this "branch", so they had tried their best to request the consent of the French Concession authorities. However, they have not yet obtained permission, so the +6 Pupu Tie Men Gate is still closed as before. Although the Nanyang Bridge Xin Kai He Gate has been opened, the traffic is inconvenient. In addition, most of the local goods merchants refuse to "register" to participate, so although the "branch" has been established, the opening date is still far away.

### Charity Broadcast - Grand Occasion Yesterday

Relief for Zhongshan Refugees

Yesterday was the second day of the charity broadcast, which was still held in the glass room of the Xindu Hotel. Because it was Sunday, there were very enthusiastic crowds. Ou Weiguo, Lin Kanghou, and others spoke one after another, clarifying the meaning of not distinguishing between cities and helping each other with united efforts. Then, famous musicians performed Western music. The overture and Madam Wei Li Xuefang, Mr. and Mrs. Chen Junying, were particularly eye-catching. Mr. Xie Xiaochu's daughter's rehearsal of Mei Longzhen and the Cantonese opera by the Hualian Tongle Club were all performed in costumes and were very exciting. The results of the donation were excellent. Today is the last day, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Jin Tingyi will give speeches. Zhang Yeye, He Biandai, and Shen Xiaoting will sing humorous masterpieces. After 4 o'clock, there will be a complete Peking Opera program, with the participation of Hailisheng and all the famous amateur performers, actors, and actresses in Shanghai. The occasion will be unprecedented. All sectors of society are welcome to donate and request songs.

### Villagers Near Zhuzhai Tragically Slaughtered

More Than a Hundred People Already - The Town Is Still Safe

Regarding the news that the entire town of Zhuzhai was burned down, the reliable news from those who escaped to Shanghai from the town recently is that only a few nearby villages were burned. As of now, the town's houses are still intact as before. However, the situation of guerrilla teams and Japanese puppet troops clashing in the suburbs of Shanghai and the Japanese troops harassing the area is true.

Situation Before the War - Zhuzhai Town is located in western Shanghai, between the Suzhou River and Hongqiao Airport. It was originally a complex area, and the North Zhuzhai Highway can be followed to the New Beijing Highway and then to Shanghai. The transportation is extremely convenient, and it became a rice market center for a time. The troops stationed in the town were originally the guerrilla forces of Gu Fusheng. Gu's troops had a strong reputation with friendly forces and were very powerful. The Japanese puppets did not dare to intervene at first. Later, due to some reasons, Gu's troops moved west to the Guanyintang area, and were replaced by the puppet guerrilla team of Xu Liansheng.

Outline of the Tragedy - This time, near the Wangjia Hong Village in western Panlong Town, a family surnamed Mou held a wedding. There were many guerrilla troops from Gu's troops attending the celebration. More than one Japanese soldier came and were killed by them. The rest escaped, causing a huge wave. A large number of Japanese troops from Nanxiang, Huangdu, Qingpu, Qixian, and Xujing were mobilized to avenge the incident. Heavy street fighting has been occurring along the Qinghu Highway for days, and Gu Fusheng's troops are also fighting back with all their strength. It is said that the Japanese troops have been severely injured. The incident has lasted for a week and is expanding. After the Japanese troops arrived in Zhuzhai Town, they were guided by the puppet troops of Xu's team and searched everywhere for guerrilla forces. Because they found nothing, they cruelly slaughtered the local people to vent their anger. In recent days, more than a hundred farmers in the four villages near the town have been tragically slaughtered. Only townspeople have not been killed. Those who were killed were all farmers because they were similar to the guerrilla forces and were not easy to identify. Women were subjected to inhumane humiliation, which was too horrible to hear. At present, a large number of Japanese troops are still stationed in the town, dressed as our country's farmers, holding ropes, and searching for pedestrians on the road.

### Apartment Rent Increase Dispute: French Consul Investigates

The "North-China Daily News" reports that the Budong Building (translation), located at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue de Zonglu, is leased by the American China Trading Company. Recently, one of the wealthy tenants in the building refused to increase the rent, leading to litigation. The tenant won the case. The China Trading Company then stated that the current rent collected was insufficient to maintain the building. They sent letters to the 45 tenants, stating that the building would be closed on August 31 of this year, and water and electricity would be cut off on that day, and requested the tenants to move out immediately. The tenants did not want to move out, so they asked the French Consul Eugene to mediate. Yesterday (the 20th), Eugene mentioned this matter and said that the French Concession authorities are deeply concerned about the rent issue. This dispute between the China Trading Company and the tenants must be studied from all aspects before any statement can be made.

### Swire Godown is Full of Stored Rice, and There is No Room for More. Notice to Merchants to Take Delivery of Goods, Otherwise, Godown Rent Will Be Increased. The Stabilization Committee Scheduled to Discuss Fundraising Procedures

After the Stabilization Committee decided to continue handling stabilization matters, they are soliciting stabilization donations, tentatively set at one million yuan. In addition to the 300,000 yuan already pledged by various industries, the remainder is still awaiting generous donations from all sectors. In order to actively proceed, it has been decided to convene a full committee meeting at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road at 2:00 PM on Friday, the 26th of this month. At that time, all fundraising procedures will be decided. Those enthusiastic people from all walks of life who donate funds can directly pay to Shanghai Jincheng Tongrun Fuyuan and other banks.

Prohibit Buying Short: The Shanghai Municipal Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association issued a notice to the market stating, "Buying and selling short has always been strictly prohibited. Rice and grain are necessities for the people, and all transactions must be in cash. Except for foreign rice sales, which can be sold futures based on the original bill of lading, all other buying and selling short is not allowed. Otherwise, if there are disputes, this association will not accept them, and legal sanctions will be imposed. Fearing that it will become a habit over time, a special notice is issued for general knowledge, and it is hoped that everyone will abide by it."

Urging Delivery of Godown Rice: The association issued another notice stating, "We have received a notice from Swire Shipping Company that because the godown is becoming increasingly full of stored rice, later goods cannot be accommodated. The godown rice and grain must be promptly removed. Otherwise, the industry must promptly remove the rice and grain stored in the godown, otherwise the godown rent will be increased. Therefore, we issue a notice urging everyone to find ways to clear the accumulated goods in the godown to avoid excuses for increasing rent. This is very important. Special notice." It is heard that other godowns have similar situations, and those who hoard goods are feeling a little棘手.

### Pickled Meat Business: A Steep Decline

Difficult to Obtain Sources, Prices Soaring. The pickled meat industry, including salted meat and salted fish, has recently experienced a stagnant business, and business is extremely sluggish. As a result, some stores in the industry, unable to sustain their operations, may close down in the second half of the year. According to investigations, wholesale dealers such as Datong, Yida, and Jieshun are quite large, with a total of more than eight companies. There are also more than 80 stores in the two concessions. Before the war, each store had an annual turnover of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and the price of each load was only more than ten yuan, but now it has risen to more than 5,000 yuan per load. Furthermore, the sources are subject to taxes and levies. For example, goods worth only 20 yuan are taxed more than 10 yuan by the Japanese and forcibly levied more than 10 yuan by the puppet army. As a result, goods worth 20 yuan are often taxed as much as 30 yuan. In addition, the price of salt has risen, and sales have also decreased. Since the opening of the puppet "Central Market" on April 1, the industry has become even more deserted. The heavy exploitation is even more intensified than before. For example, a commission of 10 yuan must be drawn from every 100 yuan, and most of it is forced to be sold retail. The so-called "retail" is that goods worth more than 100 yuan are forcibly purchased by the puppet government at a low price of more than 90 yuan. After the purchase, the puppet government sells them at a price of 100 yuan, reaping the benefits. However, as the spring and summer seasons are approaching, the weather is too warm, and the manufacture of pickled meat is still awaiting the arrival of autumn. Therefore, the number of these goods transported into the concession recently is very small, only a few thousand per month. The profits obtained by the Japanese and puppets are also limited. Moreover, in reality, most of the goods still come from Shandong, shipped to Shanghai by foreign merchant ships and landed at the concession docks, escaping exploitation. However, the future is extremely difficult to be optimistic.

### Union Shipyard Strike: Expanding

Small Steamer Department Engine Idling. Labor Hopes for a Reasonable Solution

The strike at the Union Shipyard in Yangshupu, Shanghai, which began on the 14th of last month, has not been resolved to this day, more than a month later. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. On the 16th and 17th, workers at the He Feng and Dong Jia Du docks of the shipyard, sympathizing with the workers of the Rui Rong and Ye Song departments, went on strike successively. The small steamer department of the shipyard also went on strike on the 19th. It is heard that the cold work shop and the Chinese employees of the shipyard may also respond. The person in charge of the labor side issued a statement saying that they are extremely willing for the workers and the management to discuss this strike event together and reach a fair and reasonable solution. Therefore, they sincerely hope that the factory will understand that the workers' demands are justified, dispel prejudices, and avoid a situation that becomes unmanageable and increases losses for both labor and management. As for the workers in the He Feng and Dong Jia Du departments and the workers of the small steamer department joining the strike, it is entirely voluntary, all in order to demand improved treatment.

### Public Concession Sanitation Overview

Although the discovery of various infectious diseases last month did not show a trend of drastic development, the number of recorded cases of typhoid fever was three times higher than the previous month. Given that the highest monthly numbers in May and August of last year reached 400 cases, the phenomenon of this disease last month deserves attention. The disinfection methods used during last year's epidemic were quite effective. This year, the refugee shelters where this disease has occurred have also been disinfected separately to emphasize hygiene. The number of vaccinations was no less than 3,659, breaking the previous record and comparable to the number of vaccinations in some European cities throughout the year.

The record of deaths among Chinese people was 3,312, including 1,450 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were tuberculosis, typhoid fever, cerebral congestion, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Six Chinese private schools receiving subsidies from the bureau were notified for poor internal equipment, and fifteen were notified for overcrowding. Twenty-one schools were able to fully comply with the regulations, and six were able to reduce overcrowding. Tea houses operated as usual, and prices generally rose.

There are currently 26 shelters in the concession, accommodating a total of 3,356 refugees. The three shelters in Western Shanghai have been closed.

### Summary of Important News

Chinese Staff Rice Allowance: Chinese staff of the Public Concession Bureau, all those with a monthly salary of less than one hundred yuan, will be given a rice allowance. The calculation method is to take the average daily rice price in the previous month from the 16th to the 15th of the month, deduct the base rice price of thirty-two yuan per stone of 176 pounds, and half of the remaining number will be the rice allowance to be given, but the maximum shall not exceed seven yuan. If meals are provided by the bureau, this subsidy will no longer be given. According to statistics, the amount for January was 3 yuan 3 jiao 7 fen, for February 3 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen, and for March 6 yuan 7 jiao. The supplements have already been issued according to these numbers.

South City Inoculation: Starting yesterday, the Japanese army and the puppet social bureau in South City began inoculating for epidemic prevention. The inoculation will take place from the 20th to the 27th of this month, and from May 1st to May 7th. After this period, no more inoculations will be given. However, starting today, those entering and leaving South City must have an epidemic prevention certificate, otherwise they will not be allowed to pass.

Shelter News: The first shelter of the Compassionate Relief Association, located at the intersection of North Henan Road and Wenjian Shi Road, and the eleventh shelter, located at the intersection of Hart Road and Love Avenue, will be closed earlier at the end of this month because the landlord needs the houses.

### Husband and Wife Should Both Ask Themselves in the Quiet of the Night

Is your love progressing or regressing? ...

Whether you are a wife or a husband, if you want to create a happy family and enjoy some family happiness, then you must clearly ask yourself in the quiet of the night whether your love is increasing or decreasing: It is of course a good thing if you can continue to increase your love. If your love is gradually decreasing, you should examine the fundamental reasons! There are many simple-minded women who, after marrying their husbands, think that their husbands are always by their side. They often neglect to pay attention. It is not until her husband becomes the lover of another woman that she begins to suspect and feel the change in her husband, but it is too late! On the other hand, there are probably more men who rudely ignore the gentle characteristics of their wives and only seek selfish revelry, not knowing that a strong crossbow at the end of its flight cannot pierce silk, how frustrating is this? Or, in their early years, they indulge in self-gratification, destroying the endocrine function of the reproductive glands, and suffering from spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm infertility, and premature aging. Then, after marriage, it will be difficult to have a happy and harmonious marital life. Or, they may be able to cope with it in the early days of marriage, but later they will gradually feel weak and incompetent, or they may even be unable to consummate the marriage at the beginning, how can this not make the wife in her youth feel depressed or full of resentment, leading to elopement, divorce, and other tragedies?

Neglecting the most important things and busying yourself with unimportant things is the most foolish thing to do. The husband is the head of the family, and you, as husband and wife, should carefully consider the development of your love. In case you have the above-mentioned symptoms due to self-gratification in your early years, then in today's era of advanced medicine, treatment is not difficult. Why lose the big for the small, delay and mislead yourself and others!

Treatment methods for the above-mentioned symptoms: According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Reproductive Hormone," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of healthy animals, is the most effective treatment. Because the ingredients of this preparation are precious and its efficacy is certain, it is unmatched by any similar preparation. After taking it, men can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and invigorate the blood overnight. It is especially suitable to take it continuously, which will further promote development, nourish the nerves, and thicken the sperm and blood. It will definitely cure various symptoms in a short period of time, making energy twice as abundant. Middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will prolong life, rejuvenate, and return to youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take the special medicine "Ximituo's Sperm-Stabilizing Tablets" (sold in major Chinese and Western pharmacies at two yuan per liang) to strengthen the sperm gate and stop ejaculation for even faster results.

This is a recent fact. The patient is Mr. Zheng Jiamin from Guangdong. After marriage, he had symptoms of premature ejaculation and impotence, and also suffered from spermatorrhea. Although he had repeatedly taken over-the-counter medicines on the market, they were ineffective. Last month, he was introduced by a friend to this clinic for treatment. After a detailed examination of his condition, he was instructed to purchase two dozen "Reproductive Hormone" and half a dozen "Ximituo's Sperm-Stabilizing Tablets" and take them continuously. He was also given the latest medical techniques such as electrotherapy injections every other day. In just one month, he recovered completely, his energy was strong, and the love between husband and wife was as good as new.

### Spermatorrhea and Brain Weakness Have Endless Consequences

— Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases

Spermatorrhea and brain weakness in young people often go hand in hand. Indeed, excessive use of the brain can also lead to spermatorrhea, but most people suffer from brain weakness due to spermatorrhea. The brain is the control center of the human body's actions. People are able to think deeply, discern clearly, memorize, and reason to complete their organized and valuable work, and this is entirely due to the function of the brain. How can they function if they suffer from brain weakness?

Why does spermatorrhea lead to brain weakness? According to medical judgment, semen is the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands in the body. In addition to being transported through the vas deferens to the seminal vesicles for reproductive purposes, most of the fluid can directly penetrate the blood and irrigate the whole body, nourishing the brain, nerves, spinal cord, and other parts. If young people suffer from spermatorrhea and delay treatment, the brain nerves will be the first to be affected, and then symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, dizziness, and blurred vision will arise. In addition, symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and scattered energy are signs of sexual nerve weakness; back pain, aching limbs, and fatigue are symbols of spinal nerve weakness. Not only that, if spermatorrhea leads to sperm depletion and blood depletion, then the development process will also stagnate, and the metabolic function will decline. Symptoms such as incomplete development and premature aging will then arise. Such young people will inevitably fail in their studies, find it difficult to learn a trade, be abandoned by women, and hated by their wives and concubines. How sad is such a life!

Young people with spermatorrhea must remedy this invisible disability. The only way is to quickly take the special medicine for treating spermatorrhea, "Ximituo's Sperm-Stabilizing Tablets," to strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves. Spermatorrhea can be cured the night after taking the medicine. If the above-mentioned symptoms have already occurred due to spermatorrhea, you must also take "Reproductive Hormone," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of healthy animals, to nourish the brain and kidneys, sperm and blood, and nerves. Continuous use will definitely cure the various symptoms in a short period of time, making the brain strong and the spirit full. Then the future can be unlimited! Those who can personally come to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment can be guaranteed to be cured of spermatorrhea.

### Breast Beauty and Spring Outing

— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA

In the sunny weather, hundreds of flowers bloom,
Ladies on spring outings come in droves,
Full breasts and slender waists are so charming,
Everyone praises the good figure.

A shapely, fleshy, and healthy beauty, if she makes an appointment with three or five girlfriends and walks leisurely in a green park in this season of abundant sunshine and blooming flowers, I believe it will definitely attract the attention of many tourists. Not only attention, but perhaps there will also be handsome young men in suits and leather shoes pursuing them. Because "beauty" and "ugliness" are things that everyone can see. No matter how famous you are for being clumsy or a student, when you see a plump arm, a graceful waist, crystal muscles, and clear curves, especially the pair of tall breasts in front, shrugging the left and right lapels, as if nodding to every tourist who is paying attention, then even if you have no evil thoughts, your eyes will involuntarily be directed there. Not only directed there, but even if you have passed her, you will turn your head back to look at her a few more times before you feel relaxed and happy. Therefore, healthy beauties with particularly developed features always have an advantage when buying things and interacting with people. Even in the sexual life between husband and wife, because their ovarian function is particularly strong and their sensuality is strong, they are like fish in water, and the love between them is deeply admired by friends and relatives. However, if in the past you have suffered from symptoms such as binding your breasts, self-gratification, irregular menstruation, or excessive vaginal discharge, which have damaged your ovarian function and affected breast development, then even if you have a beautiful face, you will inevitably be disliked by modern men, and your fate will be very tragic! As for the method of salvation, according to Chinese and Western preparations of ovarian hormone, "Female Reproductive Hormone" is the most effective treatment. Once you take it, it will greatly increase your strength, nourish your ovarian function, promote metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop vaginal discharge. If you continue to take it, it will definitely eliminate the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time, making your breasts tall, your arms plump, and your cheeks rosy, enhancing your health and beauty.

Unintentionally Entering Chronic Gonorrhea

In the initial acute symptoms, they often unintentionally enter chronic gonorrhea. According to the results of my years of experience, in addition to gonococci, there are often other bacteria mixed in, especially those caused by bacilli. The patient's subjective symptoms are an uncomfortable itching sensation in the urethra, or a slight pain, and they begin to seek medical treatment. Because they do not pay attention to hygiene, they unintentionally allow the gonococci to invade the posterior urethra from the anterior urethra, resulting in prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, cystitis, and systemic infectious arthritis, and they realize that their pain has not only not healed, but has become more severe.

Sometimes, in these cases, the urine is not completely turbid, but is mostly transparent, or slightly stained with a small amount of gonococci. However, in fact, these cases are often unintentionally transmitted to the opposite sex. Therefore, wives and husbands must pay attention to these chronic gonorrhea symptoms and seek immediate treatment. Whenever encountering these symptoms, the urine must be cultured and repeatedly examined, or the prostate must be massaged, and the fluid extracted must be examined under a microscope to identify gonococci and other bacilli, and determine the location of gonorrhea. Only then can the treatment be accurate, and the success rate will be high. In terms of treatment methods, the first is German electrical gonorrhea treatment, in which the conductor is inserted into the urethra, and then the degree of electricity is adjusted according to the severity of the condition, and the bactericidal power is directly transmitted to the lesion, stopping at the appropriate point. German serum is also selected to resist gonorrhea, kill bacteria, and provide immunity. Other methods such as washing, shock therapy, cooling, and warm bath therapy can all be applied according to the symptoms. In this way, chronic gonorrhea in these cases can be cured in four or five weeks.

Department Also Treats Syphilis, Accumulation, Chancroid. And Painless New Method for Removing Foreskin.

### This Morning at Wu Kang Medicinal Materials Firm: A Great Fire Claims Four Lives; Newly Arrived Medicinal Materials Entirely Reduced to Ashes; Neighboring He Li Yuan Medicinal Materials Firm Also Affected

Wu Kang Medicinal Materials Firm, formerly located on Xian Gua Street in the Nanshi area, moved to 390 Hankou Road in the Public Concession, a two-story building with double storefronts, after the January 28th Incident. Business was usually quite good. Recently, a large batch of new medicinal materials had been brought in and stored upstairs. Unexpectedly, around midnight last night, a fire suddenly broke out. Dense smoke filled the air, and the flames lit up the sky. Instantly, the fire spread to the neighboring He Li Yuan Medicinal Materials Firm at 394 Hankou Road. Upon receiving the alarm, the fire brigade rushed to the scene and exerted every effort to extinguish the blaze. It was not until about 1:00 AM this morning that the fire was finally put out. As a result, the building and a large quantity of medicinal materials of the Wu Kang firm were completely burned to the ground. One building of the He Li Yuan firm was also destroyed by the fire. The firm had more than 20 employees, but only 16 managed to escape at the time. It was found that four people had perished in the fire. Firefighters pulled out two bodies. Another employee, Zhang Kangning (45 years old), escaped from the fire but was burned. He was taken to Renji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. His injuries are extremely serious, and his life is in danger. It is reported that the losses are quite substantial. The cause of the fire is unknown, and the police are investigating.

### A Degenerate Son Indulges in Depravity: Wife Files for Divorce

The lawyer Jin Yu has a son named Dexiang, who is 30 years old this year. Several years ago, because Jin Dexiang did not engage in legitimate work and indulged in depravity, Lawyer Jin published a statement in the newspaper severing the father-son relationship. Recently, Dexiang's wife, Li Zongxiu (30 years old this year, from Anting), currently residing at No. 1, Lao Shou'an Lane, Ba Xian Qiao, also found their cohabitation unbearable. She specifically commissioned lawyer Wang Xintang to submit a petition to the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, filing for divorce from her husband. It is alleged that the plaintiff and the defendant were married in 1929 and have a son named Shouchun, who is 11 years old this year. Because the defendant does not engage in legitimate work, his parents-in-law no longer consider him their son. He wanders around all day and has become a beggar. Therefore, for more than ten years, the mother and son have been miserable and lonely, which is something that ordinary people cannot endure. Recently, after searching everywhere for the defendant's whereabouts, it was learned that he had been arrested by the police and transferred to the Beggars' Reformatory. Thinking of her desolate future, with nowhere to turn, she was compelled to request the court to grant a divorce. Upon receiving the petition, the court, through Judge Yu, summoned the parties to the Seventh Civil Division. The defendant's whereabouts were unknown, so the plaintiff's agent lawyer Chen stated the case. He requested public notice. The court reviewed the case and instructed that the summons be rescheduled.

### Leader of a Pickpocket Gang Arrested After Failing

He Wansheng (32 years old, nicknamed "Old Xi Da Wang"), a notorious pickpocket gang leader from Suzhou, usually dresses impeccably and behaves extravagantly. He keeps both a wife and a concubine at home. He specializes in pickpocketing passengers on public buses. When committing theft, he first uses a safety razor blade to cut open the passenger's pocket, allowing him to easily obtain the stolen money. Countless people have fallen victim. Unexpectedly, Lu Huizhong, residing at No. 12, 1125 Yuyuan Road, had over 500 yuan in national currency in his pocket on the 15th of this month. While riding the No. 22 public bus, he encountered He, the thief. As He was about to carry out his trick, Lu discovered him, grabbed him, and called for arrest. He was detained in the police station and confessed to numerous crimes. Yesterday, he was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. The thief's wife and concubine were also in court to observe. Their clothing was unusually modern, and those who did not know them would have suspected they were wealthy people's mistresses. After Judge Li Weishan conducted a trial, the case was postponed to the morning of the 24th because the plaintiff, Lu Huizhong, had not been summoned. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Gambling Den Shareholder Robbed and Plundered; Losses Estimated at Over 70,000 Yuan; Self-Prepared Handgun Also Stolen

An Jinshun, an old Anhui native in his forties and a shareholder of the Hollywood gambling den on Yuyuan Road, resides in a Western-style house at No. 21, 1293 Lane (Jiande Lane), Yuyuan Road. At around 1:45 AM yesterday morning, ten bandits wielding Mauser pistols stormed into his home, intimidating and threatening the master and servants, and confining them in one room. They assigned two bandits to monitor their movements, forbidding them from making any noise. The remaining bandits ransacked the place, arbitrarily searching and looting. It is estimated that cash, jewelry, and valuable clothing worth over 70,000 yuan were stolen. Furthermore, a self-prepared handgun that the victim usually kept, with the number 366047, was also stolen. The bandits carried out their looting for about an hour before fleeing with their loot. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple police station and requested an investigation.

### Muslim Scholar Ma Zi Shi Returns Home After Completing Studies in Egypt

### Trademark Lawsuit Involving Turtle Trademark: Appeal Dismissed

Chen Taiyan, a Ningbo native and owner of the Meiling Pharmacy at 614 Nanjing Road, previously produced a kidney-nourishing pill called "Tiger-Turtle-Bear-Deer" (also known as "Wealth-Honor-Prosperity"). After registering the trademark with the Trademark Bureau and passing the inspection by the Health Department of the Municipal Council, he launched the product. Han Longzhou, the owner of the Liu San Pharmacy, claimed that the turtle depicted in the trademark pattern of Chen's product was similar to the turtle trademark of his kidney-invigorating pills. He filed a criminal lawsuit against Chen in the First Special District Court for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce, and filed a civil lawsuit requesting a court order to publish a statement and destroy the trademarked items. Chen argued that his product and the plaintiff's product were clearly different in terms of name, pattern, box color, bottle color, and pill color. The size of the turtles depicted was also different. How could it be said that he was counterfeiting? After the trial, Chen was found not guilty, and the civil lawsuit was dismissed. Han, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court and also filed an objection with the Trademark Bureau. The Trademark Bureau rejected the objection. The appeal case was also heard by the High Court. Chen's lawyers, Qian Xingzhong, Zhu Qichao, and Huang Huancheng, presented various documents and evidence from the Trademark Bureau, requesting that the appellant's appeal be dismissed. After the presiding judge Zhou Hanting of the Second Branch of the High Court concluded the trial, the judgment was announced yesterday, dismissing both Han's criminal appeal and the civil lawsuit. The turtle-related lawsuit thus came to an end.

### Social Miscellany

After the gambling den reported to the police, they went to the meeting as scheduled and apprehended two people who had written the threatening letter. Zhou Zhao, a woman from Hangzhou residing at No. 8, Lane 71, Jing'an Temple Road, was detained by the police on the 18th of this month for beating her maid Wang Jinfeng (9 years old). Yesterday, she was sent to the First Special District Court. After Judge Xiao ascertained the facts, he sentenced Zhou Zhao to a fine of 15 yuan for causing bodily harm. Wang Jinfeng was returned to her mother, Zhang.

At 2:30 AM on the 20th, several bandits armed with weapons robbed the warehouse of the Japanese-owned Ohashi Yoko store on Huade Road, Yangshupu Road, in eastern Shanghai, stealing 20 bags of soybeans, worth about 460 yuan, before fleeing.

### Old News Re-Copied: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (362)

(See this newspaper from the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)

Investigation of Copper Production in Yunnan Province

The Yunnan province procures copper ingots for the casting of coins inside and outside the capital, with an annual requirement of over ten million ingots. During the Qianlong era, due to the country's wealth and abundant currency, the Baoquan and Baoyuan Bureaus had already reduced printing and stopped casting coins, and the provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, and Huguang had also separately ceased production. However, the annual copper ingot quota was still procured and transported as before. This was because national taxation was crucial, and the transport of copper ingots took time. It was necessary to widely store reserves for continuous supply, rather than risk shortages. During the Daoguang era, due to the old and exhausted mines and the low production of copper ingots, the officials in charge were deeply concerned that the capital supply would be insufficient. Therefore, anyone who could find a new mine was immediately ordered to attempt mining, using the surplus of one mine to compensate for the deficiency of another. Subsequently, an imperial edict was issued, instructing the governors of Yunnan province to investigate the situation, properly discuss regulations, to eliminate corruption, promote benefits, enrich the country, and benefit the people. Furthermore, Yunnan province is rich in gold mines, not just copper ingots. According to the records of the Ministry of Revenue in the sixteenth year of the Jiaqing era, the silver mines in Yunnan were assessed at sixteen locations, with the total annual tax silver extracted at 26,550 taels. In the nineteenth year of the Jiaqing era, the Baisha mine was depleted and closed, and an imperial decree was issued to remove it from the list. After that, there were fifteen mines with fixed tax quotas, with an annual tax silver extraction of 24,114 taels, recorded in the Ministry of Revenue's regulations, and the gold mines in Kaihua Prefecture, Heqing Prefecture, and Yongbei Subprefecture were also taxed according to their quotas. Therefore, Yunnan province has been the most prominent and longest-running province in managing mining affairs. When Lin Wen-zhong served as governor of Yunnan and Guizhou, he issued instructions to conduct thorough surveys within his jurisdiction, widely inform the people, and cautiously encourage mining. The subprefectures and counties of Zhenyuan, Wenshan, and Guangtong, as well as the Talan Subprefecture under the jurisdiction of Pu'er Prefecture, all gradually recruited people to conduct trials. Although the tax quota was not large, the natural abundance of resources was evident. Where there is land, there must be wealth. How can it be abandoned? If it can be managed effectively, it will undoubtedly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood.

The rickshaws are adorned with spring flowers, making the "trip" worthwhile.

In this world, there is much sadness and misfortune. How many people die for fame and fortune, and how many die in worry because they cannot achieve their greatest desires in both fame and fortune. They do not know to sacrifice their life's energy to seek happiness for the masses or, further, to promote the glory of their national language and scholarship. To simply disappear after a century and rot with the grass and trees is not worthwhile. Now that the war situation is changing, the arguments of psychiatrists in various countries all advise people to change their environment with a happy spirit. This makes me think of the tranquility of ancient artists and literati, finding joy in poverty, composing poetry and appreciating flowers to create their own happy境 界, indirectly creating a happy environment for the general public to love natural beauty. They truly have the immeasurable virtue of silently turning the wheels of heaven and secretly advancing the world towards peace. Therefore, Western countries cast artists and literati in bronze statues and worship them for centuries without change.

I believe that China is a poor country, and the people are facing many difficulties and national crises. To seek a bright future, we must be determined to find happiness in poverty. The most effective way for a poor country to steadily achieve peace is to open flower exhibitions and promote flower viewing tours. The ancient sages have a constant saying, "We are not afraid of scarcity but of inequality." For example, if Western cities in the European War occasionally lacked food, they would not worry about the "scarcity" of supply as long as the distribution was "equal." The path to fame and fortune is extremely narrow and cannot meet the unlimited "demand" of the world. Only the happiness of enjoying nature requires the least number of artists and literati to devote their efforts. Once the atmosphere changes with it, it can make hundreds of millions of people smile together. I would like to introduce the "Flower Viewing Flag" of European flower exhibitions and flower viewing tours so that my compatriots can understand the way to be content in poverty and find joy in this day when the earth returns to spring.

Holland is a flower country on the sea. The country has many small farmers, and their artificial cultivation results in many "fine products." Families use potted plants for worship every day. In the spring of 1935, when the country was generally peaceful, the Dutch people held a large flower exhibition in Heemstede, a countryside near Haarlem in North Holland Province. Those who were interested printed many different sizes of "Flower Viewing Flags," which were sold out in a few days. Those who arrived late could not get them. All vehicles used for flower viewing tours, whether cars or bicycles, had a flag attached, fluttering in the wind, returning home happily. The smallest type is a silk flag, rectangular in shape, printed with the Dutch specialty tulips and daffodils as a symbol. The flag is 16.5 cm long and 9.5 cm wide. The iron supporting the flag is 30 cm long and 2 mm in diameter, about as thick as a knitting needle used by women. The difference is that the upper end of the rod is shaped like a nail head like a wire nail. Another type is a triangular felt flag, 15.5 cm high and 25.5 cm wide at the widest point of the horizontal surface. The iron rod is the same as above. Liu Yuxi, a poet of the Tang Dynasty in China, wrote a poem about flower viewing: "Purple paths and red dust come, everyone says they are returning from flower viewing. The peach trees in the Xuandu Temple are all planted by Liu Lang, going and coming." I have left the country three times, and more than 20 years have passed before and after. Past events are like clouds, and I cannot help but feel like Liu Lang returning again.

### Cloth as Precious as Gold

— Long Ju Sheng

The cotton yarn market is rising sharply, and cotton cloth prices are also soaring without end! Before the war, a piece of 12-pound coarse twill cloth was sold for only eight or nine yuan, but now it sells for forty or fifty yuan a piece. Forty yards costs about a foot, but currently, it sells for five or six cents a foot. It is truly a case of vegetables selling at meat prices and cloth selling at silk prices! If this continues, will everyone be forced to "cover their bodies and walk naked"? This is a serious problem for social life!

Rice is as precious as pearls, and cloth is as precious as gold. For families like mine with many children, I truly feel helpless! Therefore, since my family fled from East Shanghai to West Shanghai, it has been almost three years. The clothes of my entire family are still completely old clothes. If they are torn, they are torn; patching them up is fine. Moreover, the cloth clothes made before the war were very strong and durable. As long as you cherish them when you wear them and fold them neatly when you store them, there is no problem in wearing them year after year for a long life. I often wear old cloth clothes and treat them as treasures, often thinking of the hard work involved in the process of carding cotton, spinning yarn, sizing yarn, weaving cloth, and making clothes. I am all the more eager to cherish old clothes in view of the current high prices of cloth clothes. Mr. Zhu Bailu said: "One bite of porridge and one bowl of rice, we should think of the difficulty of obtaining them; half a thread and half a strand, we should always remember the difficulty of material resources." This is indeed a timeless motto. My mother also taught me, saying, "If you cherish food, you will have food to eat; if you cherish clothes, you will have clothes to wear." The words of the ancients are truly golden and jade-like advice.

Given the current situation of "cloth as precious as gold," it would cost more than twenty gold pieces to make a cloth robe! Therefore, cherishing an old robe is equivalent to saving more than twenty gold pieces. It can even be said that you are invisibly reducing the burden of more than twenty gold pieces on the expenditure side and saving the capital of more than twenty gold pieces. If everyone in the family does this, the invisible savings will be considerable. Why wouldn't everyone be happy to do it?

Therefore, my motivation for writing this article is that in this difficult time of "cloth as precious as gold," everyone should still try to wear old clothes as much as possible and not try to live beyond your means, swelling your face to look fat, and overspending and making your life more difficult. I hope everyone pays attention.

### Economic Menu for One Week

— Ms. Hua Ying

There has been a miracle in the vegetable market these days. In the midst of rising prices, it is possible to buy relatively cheap yellow croakers, only one and a half cents per two. You can buy a medium-sized yellow croaker for one dime. My family originally needed to eat two meat dishes every day, but we also took economic aspects into consideration. Because yellow croakers are cheap, we eat yellow croakers almost every day. Fortunately, there are many ways to cook yellow croakers, so we can change the style every day, so it doesn't become monotonous for a week. For example, you can braise it with pickled mustard greens or in red sauce, or braise it with bamboo shoots in red sauce or stir-fry it with vinegar. You can dredge it in flour and breadcrumbs and fry it, which can be used as a dish or a snack. In addition, you can debone the yellow croaker and make a soup with amaranth or lettuce笋 leaves, which can be used to make yellow croaker soup or yellow croaker fillet soup. All these methods are very delicious, and it all depends on the proper management of the housewife.

### The Meaning of Frugality

— He Yichang

If a person does not eat for one day, they will be hungry; if they do not eat for seven days, they will die. Therefore, the people regard food as heaven. Eating and drinking enter the stomach, originally to nourish life. After digestion by the spleen and stomach, it is transformed into essence, distributed throughout the body. The rest becomes dross, excreted through the feces. Therefore, eating and drinking should be temperate, avoiding overeating. Overeating is not only useless but also harmful, not only making people sick but also shortening lifespan. In the past, Confucius said: "A gentleman does not seek fullness in food." A common saying goes: "Eating less tastes better; eating more ruins the stomach." This is the meaning. However, because people mistakenly believe that eating and drinking nourish life, they often like to eat too much and indiscriminately, thinking that a large appetite means good health. This view is greatly mistaken. One should know that a person's stomach has a certain digestive capacity. If one eats too much, the stomach will expand, the working time will be lengthened, and the consumption of digestive power will be greater. Food in the stomach easily ferments, and the intestinal walls are more prone to decay. If the intestines and stomach are gradually injured, how can a person's lifespan be sustained for long? Mr. Ding Fubao, in his recent book "Conditions for Longevity," also advises people to eat frugally, saying that in European and American countries, the number of people who die each year from gluttony is countless, showing the harm of overeating. Moreover, during this period of widespread war and high living costs, it is even more appropriate to advocate "frugality." Rice must be eaten less and chewed carefully, and dishes should be reduced to save energy for the country and maintain health for oneself. It is also very beneficial to the national and family economy. Currently, Japan, England, and Germany are all holding "frugality movements." As our country faces severe national difficulties and is in a state of "universal poverty," we should also promote it.

### Seasickness

— Jiz

Anyone who has traveled on a sea vessel has experienced the pain of seasickness!

When seasick, one first feels a bit dizzy, as if one cannot be sure where one is sitting. Then, one feels a slight throbbing in the forehead, some pain, discomfort in the abdomen, cold sweats all over the body, and the complexion turns pale, the lips turn purple-blue, and the eyeballs are covered with blood vessels. Finally, one vomits, first emptying the food from the stomach, then the white mucus, and then only dry heaves.

Seasickness is such a painful thing, but what is the reason for it? According to the general theory, seasickness is caused by the aversion of the inner ear's vestibular nerve to the swaying of the ship. The vestibular nerve is a nerve that maintains body balance. Its hair-like endings protrude into the lymphatic fluid. When our head moves rapidly, the pressure of the lymphatic fluid changes with the shaking. The hair-like endings of the vestibular nerve are also shaken, transmitting this to various nerves, causing the muscles necessary to maintain body balance to contract in order to maintain body balance. At the same time, it directly or indirectly stimulates the vagus nerve and other nerves, affecting the digestive organs (stomach, intestines), circulatory organs (heart, blood), and so on. Thus, dizziness, lightheadedness, pale complexion, vomiting, and so on follow.

Since this is the reason, the treatment can only be local. For example, if you feel uncomfortable in the chest, open the window, change the air, and take deep breaths. To avoid the pain of vomiting, it is better to keep the abdomen empty. Find something else to distract yourself, do not dwell on the fear of dizziness, and do not let the bad surroundings stimulate your nerves. In terms of medication, no specific drugs have been invented. Commonly, tranquilizers and analgesics are used, and sometimes anesthetics are also used, but these are not fundamental solutions.

In short, those who are physically strong or who are accustomed to traveling by boat or car from childhood are better off, while nervous people are more likely to suffer from this disease.

### Small Statistics

The success of a piece of clothing, from planting cotton (or raising sheep) to wearing it, requires the efforts of twenty-eight people and one thousand six hundred hours through stages such as sowing, harvesting, spinning, weaving, and tailoring.

The success of a loaf of bread, from planting wheat to eating it, requires the efforts of twelve people and seven hundred and seventy-five hours through stages such as sowing, harvesting, grinding flour, fermenting, baking, and packaging.

A small room measuring two zhang square, if built entirely of wood (including tiles, bricks, foreign nails, etc.), requires the efforts of thirty-five people and three thousand four hundred hours from planting the forest and firing the kiln to completion, through stages such as planting, felling, firing bricks, making nails, erecting the frame, and plastering.

If a worker were to manufacture a car alone, from smelting steel to completion, including all parts, it would take eight years and six months to complete.

If the world's population were concentrated in one place and stood still, it would only require an area the size of half of Australia to accommodate. (Translated by Zhen Shan from the American Time Pictorial)

### Clothing and People

— Zhang Zhenshan

The effect of clothing on people is to keep them warm and protect their skin, and its appearance is to express demeanor and spirit. All different lifestyles can also be revealed in clothing. However, as human life has gradually changed and evolved to the present, the enjoyment of nature has also progressed with creation. Clothing has taken the position of ornaments in the lives of urban people. Most people only seek the beauty and uniqueness of form and material to proclaim their own nobility. As a result, the deformed concept of "valuing clothes over people" has emerged in society. All kinds of treachery, evil, cruelty, and fraud are growing and continuing under the cover of beautiful appearances.

We only need to pay attention to the social news in the newspapers to get clear examples. What about a gorgeously dressed girl stealing items in a department store; a well-dressed young man stealing books in a bookstore, etc.? It can be seen that in Shanghai, it is wrong to judge a person's character and personality based on the quality of their clothing. To put it plainly: many Shanghai people live in tenements and cannot afford to eat two out of three meals, but when they go out, their clothes are very gorgeous. When they walk into any large company or building, even the doorman treats them with respect, not only daring not to treat them as poor wretches, but also regarding them as good customers. There are also many people who drive cars but cannot afford the gasoline, borrowing and owing debts, but still drive fast in the city in the middle of the day. There are also those who are heavily in debt, but their clothing, food, housing, and transportation are still very extravagant—however, this requires "artistic" skills; otherwise, it would not be possible.

On the other hand—especially after the war, the appearance of some people's clothing is completely typical of a rural person, with torn clothes and cloth shoes, patches on top of patches, looking like a complete pauper. Even beggars would not ask them for money on the street. But what are they actually like? Some of them are actually wealthy. It may not be possible to bury money in the cellar in Shanghai, but in their torn clothes and rags, there may be thousands or even tens of thousands of banknotes hidden: these people neither steal nor rob, and their behavior is absolutely respectable, but they are not valued simply because their clothes are not fashionable. Someone who worked in a jewelry store told me: in jewelry stores, nine out of ten welcome fashionable people, because generally fashionable people who come into jewelry stores to buy ornaments often lose eight fen out of one qian, and still ask for a few yuan in change. On the other hand, generally rural people want their rings to be as thick as possible. They lift their aprons, and rolls of banknotes are pulled out from their bellybands or belts. Therefore, jewelry stores mostly look at these people with different eyes.

From this anecdotal experience, the division between emptiness and solidity is fully revealed, and the mystery of clothing and people is shattered without residue. An "empty shell" is worthless once it is exposed. Gorgeous clothing can only cover the blemishes on the body, but it cannot conceal the baseness of personality and character, and the emptiness of financial resources. In the current situation of striving for wartime economic frugality, we must have considerable determination. As long as we can maintain body temperature, we do not need to worry about objective evaluations, and we should express true beauty with personality and character, because the deformed concept of "valuing clothes over people" is not absolute!

### Spring is bright, don't delay quitting your addiction, a sincere warning to those who hate opium

— Du Ying

Lie down and think, sit and speak, get up and act

If you want to avoid suffering, eliminate opium addiction

Since opium flowed into China, I don't know how many promising people have been harmed, and since Shanghai became an isolated island, the source has been cut off, and the price of earth has risen sharply. The Yunnan earth, which was originally sold for about two or three yuan per liang, has risen to forty or fifty yuan per liang since last autumn, but still no genuine Yunnan earth is available. The vast gentleman group is lamenting endlessly, and because they are smoking inferior earth mixed with impurities, they are becoming more deeply poisoned, and some have even switched to smoking more poisonous substances such as morphine and heroin. This is truly a serious problem. This reporter recently interviewed Dr. Lai Gongliang, a specialist in quitting smoking at the Gongjian Hospital on Baker Road, about the current state of opium poisoning. Dr. Lai gave a detailed account of everything, and his words were to the point, which can be used as a reference for black-listed compatriots.

According to Dr. Lai, the previous Yunnan earth, Sichuan earth, and so on, were relatively less harmful because they were pure plants. Now, however, the source of Yunnan earth and Sichuan earth has been cut off, and the authorities have also strictly prohibited planting. Therefore, most of what is sold on the market is made by mixing various potent poisons such as heroin, high root, and silver with the "material." Therefore, after smoking, people often experience dizziness, chest tightness, palpitations, loss of appetite, thirst, shortness of breath, soreness in the limbs, a gray-black complexion, and the appearance of itchy small red spots on the skin. Also, when smoking, they feel a strong smell, but even if they smoke freely, they cannot invigorate their spirits, and the effect disappears in an instant. Therefore, smokers are paying such a high price to smoke this kind of inferior earth, which truly fits the ancient proverb "drinking poison to quench thirst."

In view of the above situation, smoking opium today is tantamount to digging one's own grave, but why don't smokers quit? Isn't it self-indulgence? In fact, this cannot be blamed on smokers, because quitting smoking is not easy, and those who smoke the current inferior earth find it even more difficult to completely eradicate their addiction without experienced knowledge and the combination of expensive medicines. Therefore, those who quit smoking do not understand the truth in this, or they are greedy for low prices, or they seek quick results, or they are completely impressed by exaggerated publicity. Quitting smoking in this way will naturally lead to repeated relapses, making it impossible to completely break the addiction. Even before the addiction is quit, the body becomes weaker. Therefore, the repeated relapses of smokers cannot be blamed on their lack of perseverance, but on their failure to carefully select a doctor.

Seeking a doctor and a prescription, for this reason, my treatment for quitting smoking is to maintain my reputation of more than ten years and ensure responsible and safe quitting. I do not use injections (because injections often have many drawbacks), nor do I mislead people with speed (because haste makes waste). I completely analyze the smoker's smoking amount, quality of earth, period, body, psychology, and condition, and then prescribe expensive medicines and administer different treatments. Not only is the smoking addiction quit, but the disease is also treated at the same time. To take care of the smoker's economic time, they do not have to be hospitalized during the quitting process and can continue to work, while also feeling comfortable in body and mind and invigorated in spirit. Other drugs such as morphine and heroin are also treated with the same most fundamental and effective method, so the results are fortunately all completely broken, never relapsed, and health is improved day by day. In short, each person has their own physique, temperament, and the depth of their addiction, which cannot be achieved by taking shortcuts or blindly adhering to outdated methods.

Dr. Lai's smoking cessation treatment has four major characteristics: (1) increased food intake, (2) stable sleep, (3) smooth bowel movements, and (4) invigorated spirit. To gain the trust of those receiving treatment, he first prescribes medicine for a two-day trial period. If they are satisfied, he will formally administer treatment without any pain. Therefore, Dr. Lai Gongliang of Gongjian Hospital at 208 Baker Road is the other shore that smokers must reach.

Spring and Autumn

### Sports and Hygiene Week

— Xiao Ya

Exercise is an indispensable part of life. In addition to our daily ordinary (such as walking, etc.) or laborious (such as washing clothes, etc.) exercise, there is no doubt that we also need a specific, regular exercise. That is to say, we must have a certain amount of exercise every day: such as morning exercises, playing ball, riding a horse, swimming... etc. However, we are in a pigeon-cage-like isolated island, and the place to live has already become a problem, how can there be any spare space left for us to exercise? Even if there is, it is only for some noble ladies and gentlemen to spend their time.

Because of the lack of exercise venues, the health of the people living on the isolated island has been greatly affected. Nowadays, although some people are still doing indoor exercises to make up for this shortcoming, it is only a very small number of people!

Recently, Chongqing Aviation News announced that the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Affairs have stipulated that National Sports and Hygiene Week will be from May 5th to 12th, and ordered the social bureaus and education departments of all provinces and cities to conduct health checks for primary and secondary school students. Honestly, we cannot but pay attention to and promote this movement; due to the promotion of this movement, we can better understand the government's emphasis on the health and hygiene of the people, especially young people. At the same time, we can also associate it with the health of the people living on the isolated island these days, and those with illness who are living in isolation on the island probably account for half of them." After this shocking number, there is a genuine sense of ". We should not underestimate this movement. At the same time, we should respond to this movement and hope that the city's doctors will provide free health checks for the people of the city during the dates of this movement.

### The Problem of Bathing and Cleanliness

— Zili

The weather is getting hot again, so this densely populated Shanghai, where people live like pigeons in cages, is having problems again. In winter, it doesn't matter if several people are squeezed into one room, but in hot weather, it doesn't work, especially in dormitories such as schools, hygiene problems need more attention. Shanghai school dormitories are generally very small, and many students live in them. Schools are very negligent about the cleanliness and hygiene of students, and do not pay attention to it, so the dormitories are often very messy and filthy, and at night they are filled with a special smell, which is very harmful to the health of young students.

In this environment, it may not be possible to make excessive demands to thoroughly improve the school authorities, but as this hot summer is approaching, public places are very prone to dangerous epidemics, so I sincerely hope that the school can implement the following points as a preventive measure:

First, order all students to be vaccinated against smallpox and vaccinated against epidemics as soon as possible. Second, provide bathing facilities. Bathing is urgently needed after the weather is hot, but the cost of going to the bathhouse is high, and most students cannot afford it, so the school should set up its own bathroom or contact the bathhouse to give preferential treatment to students. Third, attention should be paid to the cleanliness of student bedrooms. More attention should be paid to the fact that students often do not change their bedding for a semester, and some do not even tidy up. Therefore, teachers should often urge students to change or wash and wash bedding and conduct general cleaning of the  room.

"A sound mind resides in a sound body." I hope that today's schools will pay more attention to the health of students while teaching them.

### The Rectification of "One-Sided Eggs" (1)

— San San

Reading the article "One-Sided Eggs" by Mr. (Liren) on the 19th, it refers to the packaged meals using "egg yolks" bought from biscuit companies for cooking every day. He said; "…You think, the protein has been extracted by the biscuit company for use in biscuits, then isn't this residue useless…But we don't have to eat meat, we would rather eat green vegetables and tofu than eat this kind of "one-sided egg.""

Of course, we are not as comfortable eating packaged meals for a lower price as we are cooking ourselves or going to a restaurant. At the same time, the packaged meal makers are providing us with food in the midst of rising prices of all goods, so they have to handle the ingredients from destinations with lower prices. This is their hard work, and we should forgive them. Moreover, under the current situation, we can eat "eggs," which can be considered lucky on the hunger line.

Also, "egg yolk" is not a bad thing, it has less "protein" than "egg white" and a large amount (fat), and its nutritional content is similar to that of "fatty meat". Now I will write the percentage of nutritional content of "egg white," "egg yolk," "green vegetables," and "tofu" below, and compare it with pork:

Protein Fat

Egg White 20.6 None

Egg Yolk 16.2 30.7

Green Vegetables 1.7 0.2

Tofu 35.0 18.0

Fatty Pork 14.0 37.3

Lean Pork 19.5 6.8

(II) Li Zhi

(Above omitted) In terms of nutrition, egg yolk is indeed more nutritious than egg white. The composition of the two is as follows:

Egg Yolk Egg White

Water 49.5 86.2

Protein 15.7 12.3

Fat 33.3 0.2

In addition, egg yolk is rich in vitamins A, B, and D, and contains a large amount of iron and phosphorus, which are elements for nourishing blood and the brain. Currently, nutritionists in Europe and the United States advocate eating eggs and discarding the egg white in favor of the egg yolk. That's the reason. In this light, the so-called (one-sided egg) is actually a nourishing food!

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 23

Old friends reunite, articles have value, scenic spots are well-managed

He Li asked, "Presumably the agency department is even more developed now. When can we also visit it?" Qu Wushuang said, "The agency department is not connected to the newspaper office. It is set up as a separate department. The reason why they entrusted us in the beginning was because our newspaper can reach everywhere, even remote rural areas, and it is mostly due to the power of this advertisement. This agency department is mostly related to cultural undertakings. But now many trust departments are also handled, and as transportation has gradually developed, there are liaison offices in various border and inland areas. So we want to close the agency department and transfer it to another organization."  Just as they were talking about that, Wu Junsu smiled and asked: "There is one more thing I want to ask. Just now, Sister Wushuang pointed at Huihua and said that she is a movie star. Has she really made movies?" Qu Wushuang laughed: "That's just a joke. Once, many male and female reporters in our newspaper office went on a spring outing and also took a camera to shoot their own films. It was the time when the flowers were like brocade and the fragrant grass was like a carpet. We also held picnics, bringing many breads, cold foods, and canned foods ourselves. She! Huihua! Was the happiest. She was just jumping around. Whenever we encountered scenic spots, we would shoot with the camera. Because she was happy, we asked her to be a character in the film. Sometimes we asked her to sit by the water, sometimes we asked her to stand under the trees, sometimes she would smile with flowers in her hands, sometimes she would sleep on the mat, sometimes she would row a light boat, rippling in the heart of the lake, sometimes she would ride a bicycle, speeding across the grass, and there were all her beautiful shadows in it. So we call her a movie star, not that she really went to a movie company to be a movie star." Wu Junsu said, "So that's how it is. I thought she had really been a movie star." Qu Wushuang said, "Not only that, but she is also very skilled at taking movies. Whenever there is a grand event that is going to be made into a movie, she often takes a cameraman and sets off together. So we have many movies in our newspaper office that are directed and collected by her." Just as she was saying that, a female photography technician walked in, holding a small camera in her hand, and walked to Qu Wushuang and said, "Miss Zhai! Can we take a picture?" Qu Wushuang said, "Sure." She raised her hand, and with a push of the camera button, a photo had already been taken. This kind of camera is probably still imported from abroad. Although there are also companies in China that manufacture cameras, they are not so smart. And in the past, when taking pictures indoors, it was necessary to use magnesium light or something, but now that photography has advanced, it is no longer necessary. Even during banquets, with a casual wave of the hand, the photo is already clearly taken. (266)
