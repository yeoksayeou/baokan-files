### Military and Economic Alliance Established by Germany, Italy, and Japan; Mutual Aid and Cooperation for a Ten-Year Term; Existing Political Relations with the Soviet Union Unaffected

Berlin – It is hereby announced that the official documents of the German, Italian, and Japanese tripartite pact were signed here this afternoon at 1 PM. (Haitong Telegram, 27th)

Berlin – Japan has today joined the German-Italian Axis and signed a military and economic alliance with Germany and Italy. This historic alliance of the three omnipotent nations was signed in Hitler’s presence at 1:12 PM in the German capital. This alliance, designed by Germany to hinder American actions and divide the British Empire, will have a tremendous impact on the future of the Far East. The signing of the agreement resembled the signing or holding of the German-Italian military alliance last year. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, who represented Italy in the signing, arrived in Berlin at 12:30 PM, two and a half hours later than expected. Ciano was accompanied by many experts on treaties from the Italian Foreign Ministry. In front of the Brandenburg Gate, in addition to the German and Italian flags, a Japanese flag was also hung, and small Japanese flags were distributed to German schoolchildren in the streets by the authorities. (United Press Telegram, 27th)

Berlin – The full text of the official document of the German, Italian, and Japanese tripartite pact is as follows: Germany, Italy, and Japan, believing that the prerequisite for lasting peace is that all nations in the world obtain appropriate positions, have decided to cooperate with each other in the efforts of the three countries in the "Greater East Asia" and the European regions. The main goal of the three countries is to build a new order and increase the prosperity and welfare of all countries involved. The three governments hope to cooperate with countries in other regions to achieve the ultimate desire for a peaceful world. Therefore, the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan have agreed on the following articles:

Article 1: Japan recognizes and respects the leading position of Germany and Italy in building a new European order in Europe.

Article 2: Germany and Italy recognize and respect the leading position of Japan in building a "New Order in Greater East Asia" in Asia.

Article 3: Germany, Italy, and Japan agree to cooperate and strive according to the above guidelines. If one of the signatory countries encounters an attack from a country not currently involved in the European war or the Sino-Japanese war, the three countries shall provide mutual assistance in political, economic, and military affairs.

Article 4: To fulfill this agreement, the joint technical committee appointed by the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan shall meet as soon as possible.

Article 5: Germany, Italy, and Japan declare that the above provisions do not affect the existing political relations of the signatory countries with the Soviet Union.

Article 6: This agreement shall take effect immediately after signing and shall be valid for a period of ten years. Upon the request of any signatory country, the three countries shall conduct negotiations regarding the extension of the validity period at an appropriate time before the expiration of this agreement. The representatives of the three countries, authorized by their respective governments, have signed and sealed this document in triplicate in Berlin on September 27, 1940. (Haitong Telegram, 27th)

Berlin – It is generally believed that this pact replaces the previous Anti-Comintern Pact of the three countries. However, it is noteworthy that the Anti-Comintern Pact was specifically aimed at the Soviet Union, and the current pact has added special recognition to the new relationship with the Soviet Union. Diplomatic circles here feel that Article 3 of the pact means that Germany and Italy will provide assistance to Japan. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)

Declaration of the Three Signatory Nations

Berlin – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally received Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Japanese Ambassador Kurusu to participate in the signing ceremony of the German, Italian, and Japanese tripartite pact. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a speech, stating that the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan have decided to sign an important pact. After reading the full text of the pact in German, Italian, and Japanese, he declared on behalf of the German government that Germany, since 1933, has hoped to modify the status quo peacefully, and the German people also have the right to govern their natural territory. The National Socialist Party has long decided to obtain the right to survive for the German people. The tripartite pact signed on the order of Führer Hitler is a solemn declaration of the united alliance of the three countries to realize common interests. The purpose of this pact is for Germany and Italy to lead the construction of a new European order, and for Japan to lead the construction of a "New Order in Greater East Asia." The foundation of this pact is not only the friendship of the three countries but also the common interests of the three countries. This pact is not aimed at any country but is aimed at steps taken by those who incite war and attempt to prolong or expand the war. This pact is a military alliance treaty of the three major powers, which will help the construction of a new order in Europe and "Greater East Asia" and make world peace a reality as soon as possible. Any country that wishes to join this group will be sincerely welcomed, but those who attempt to interfere in the solution of European or East Asian issues, or attack one of the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, will encounter the combined power of 250,000,000 people from the three countries. Ciano also delivered a speech, stating that the new pact is a bulwark against the expansion of war, but the importance of the pact transcends the current situation and represents the permanent unity of the three countries. The Japanese ambassador declared that the ultimate goal of the pact is to build world peace, a universal and lasting peace based on justice, and hopes to cooperate with countries with the same goals and implementing the same plans. The pact for Germany, Italy, and Japan

Berlin – Italian Foreign Minister Ciano read a document regarding the German, Italian, and Japanese tripartite pact, stating that this pact has proven the political, economic, and military cooperation and common interests and goals of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The three countries must seek space for survival, but they are rejected by countries that monopolize world resources. The unity of the three countries is not a temporary diplomatic strategy but a manifestation of history. This unity can be found in history for common causes and goals. This pact is simple and clear: Germany and Italy and Japan mutually recognize the leading position in building a new order. Germany, Italy, and Japan have no intention of threatening other countries but aim to prevent the expansion of war. This pact not only represents the current unity but also has a decisive value for the future. (Haitong Telegram, 27th)

Reactions from Britain and the United States

London – Britain has given its first reaction to the German, Italian, and Japanese alliance, saying that the treaty is essentially a vague treaty. Well-informed sources say that, from the British perspective, it is difficult to predict how much the treaty will affect the current situation. They also say that it is unlikely that Germany and Italy will take strong actions against Britain by uniting with Japan. They also cited the US loan of US$250 million to China and President Roosevelt's ban on steel exports to the Axis powers and Japan, saying that people should assess the gains and losses of democratic countries in the future. Officials here also say that Britain is not afraid of such an alliance agreement. (United Press Telegram, 27th)

Washington – Unofficial circles in the United States have immediately reacted to the German, Italian, and Japanese agreement, saying that the agreement, from this perspective, is merely a fact that will last for at most five years. The State Department is unwilling to issue an immediate comment on this, but authoritative sources say that the purpose of this agreement is undoubtedly to deal with the United States.

Editorial

### The Lingering and Unresolved Labor Dispute in Public Transportation

Since the tram and bus workers in the Public Concession successively went on strike, followed by the tram and bus workers in the French Concession taking the same action, although a small number of trams in the French Concession occasionally managed to operate to benefit pedestrians, it can be said that the entire public transportation system within the Shanghai Concession has been completely paralyzed due to the strike. The profound and serious impact this has had on millions of citizens is self-evident; therefore, everyone urgently hopes for an early resolution of the labor dispute, but the aloofness of both sides seems to indicate that there is no hope of resuming work for the time being. Labor disputes in a certain industry or commerce only affect those related to that particular industry. For example, if the staff of a pharmacy goes on strike, there is still no need to worry about not being able to buy medicine, so the impact on the general public is minimal. However, since public utilities are for public use, both labor and management should not only consider their own interests but also the interests of the public. How can they allow the innocent to suffer when a fire breaks out at the city gate? Therefore, if the labor dispute is prolonged for even one day, the general public's displeasure with both labor and management in public utilities will increase day by day. The concession authorities, who usually show great consideration for increasing tram and bus fares and readily approve them, should now take effective measures to address the inconvenience caused to citizens by the public transportation workers' strike and seek a fair solution to facilitate an early resumption of work for the benefit of travelers. This is what the general public desires.

The reason for the strike must be simple and necessary, which can be summarized as an economic one. Given the current increase in prices and the daily expenses exceeding income, except for a very small number of wealthy and leisured classes, everyone feels the hardship of life. Therefore, the motivation of transportation workers to maintain their necessary survival and hope to improve their original treatment to cope with their current life is pure, and their demands are out of necessity. They have no choice but to resort to the workers' ultimate weapon – the strike. Considering the situation, we cannot help but sympathize with them to a considerable extent. However, transportation workers, who are responsible for maintaining public transportation and facilitating public movement, should also consider the inconvenience that the public feels after the strike. If they can restore the original means of transportation as soon as possible to facilitate public movement, what will the public think? The labor side may think that the responsibility does not lie with the workers but with the management: if the management can accommodate the demands of the labor side, they can resume work in the evening after hearing the order in the morning. This is certainly true, but we believe that the negotiation of conditions has its necessary process; how to establish an agreement that both parties can agree to cannot be done in an instant. However, everything must have its principles. Once the principles are established, the details can be easily resolved. Therefore, we believe that once the principles can be agreed upon by both parties, work should be resumed immediately, and the detailed agreement can be left to the negotiation of the representatives of both parties.

Currently, foreign businesses often have a common misconception: they are diligent in maintaining their profit standards. Therefore, when foreign exchange shrinks, they always ignore the burden of the public and increase surcharges and raise prices. They may not have the sincerity of sharing weal and woe with the production workers. It is said that people only know propriety when they are well-fed. When people's lives are unsustainable, they will no longer hesitate to instigate trouble and raise their arms. Moreover, since labor disputes are called "tides," it is easy to stir up trouble! If the management usually neglects to pay attention to the living conditions of the workers, and when the labor dispute arises, they cannot find a solution and only express deep regret to the customers, what good will it do? Even refusing to meet with the representatives of the labor side will only further distance them from a solution.

We believe that labor-management disputes are inevitable, but both labor and management should remember that although their positions may be different, their interests are ultimately the same. Therefore, the labor side should not ask for anything other than what is necessary for their survival and what they are entitled to. The management should handle reasonable demands in good faith, adopting them as much as possible, and clearly stating the reasons for not adopting them so that the labor side knows that their demands are excessive. In today's situation, there is superficial prosperity, but the inside is actually empty.
Mr. [Hotsumi Ozaki] stated that [Yosuke] Matsuoka is a "strong character" and can use an iron will like Hitler to deal with any weakness of foreign countries. However, Mr. Hotsumi also stated that Matsuoka is also a realist and will not underestimate the strength of the Anglo-American alliance. Mr. Hotsumi also stated that Matsuoka's actions, whether stubborn or wrong, are based on self-confidence, so the result of his actions will either be hopeful or dangerous.

British Government Encouraged by the United States to Reopen the Burma Road

Washington – The new US loan to China has already led to speculation here about what steps the US government will take to express its opposition to Japan's advance into Vietnam. After President Roosevelt announced the ban on scrap iron exports, people here are increasingly convinced that Britain, encouraged by the United States, will reopen the Burma Road when the three-month period expires in October. After China receives the new US loan, it can continuously obtain military supplies and other goods from the United States. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)

Chongqing – The three-month suspension of the Yunnan-Burma Road is about to expire. Various civic diplomatic groups here have successively visited British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, stating the Chinese people's deep hope that Britain will unconditionally open the road on schedule. Kerr has been in frequent contact with various parties in recent days to listen to opinions on opening the road in order to report to the London government. (Havas Telegram, 27th)

### Americans Assist China with Relief Funds; Chinese Embassy in the United States Holds Acceptance Ceremony

### Long Yun Orders General Mobilization: Yunnan Border Declares Martial Law; French Authorities Decline Chinese Assistance, Issue Urgent Request to Tokyo: Japanese Troops Continue Southward Advance

Chongqing: According to Kunming sources, Chinese troops along the Vietnamese border remain stationed within the territory. The border region of Yunnan Province was placed under martial law on September 25th. Military authorities are conducting rigorous searches of people passing through Hekou and Maripo (transliteration). To disrupt the Japanese rear in Vietnam, Chinese troops are currently applying pressure on the Japanese near Fangcheng, on the coast of Guangdong Province. After the Chinese troops recaptured the city, the Japanese immediately launched a counterattack, entering the city on the evening of September 23rd, but the following night the city was retaken by the Chinese troops. Kunming is currently calm as usual, and foreigners have not evacuated. However, all central government agencies are preparing to leave, with most relocating to Sichuan Province. Residents have been warned to evacuate voluntarily; those who do not comply will be forcibly evacuated. Merchants are currently transporting goods out of the city. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing: Kunming sources recently reported that Long Yun, Chairman of Yunnan Province, has ordered the mobilization of all manpower and resources to protect Yunnan Province from invasion. According to a Da Gong Bao correspondent stationed in Yunnan, Chiang Kai-shek's temporary headquarters in Yunnan has ordered strict inspections of travelers from Vietnam to prevent spies. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing: Chinese sources are currently confused about developments in Vietnam. The Chinese side yesterday granted the request of the Vietnamese authorities and dispatched a special plane to the Vietnamese border to transport Vietnamese representatives to Chongqing for discussions. However, although the Chinese plane reached the border, no representatives arrived. It is reported that the Vichy government has declined Chinese assistance to Vietnam. Meanwhile, local sources responsible for receiving information from foreigners in Hanoi have learned that Japanese planes bombed Hanoi and Haiphong yesterday. Japanese planes flew over Hanoi and dropped three small bombs, but were driven back by French anti-aircraft fire. Subsequently, Japanese planes flew to Hanoi again, but did not drop bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing: Official sources announced today that Chinese troops, after two days of bloody fighting with Japanese troops, completely recaptured Fangcheng in southwestern Guangdong on Tuesday. Chinese troops entered the city on Monday evening and drove out the remaining Japanese troops. Chinese military officials stated that the recapture of Fangcheng was a good result for the Chinese troops since the Japanese invasion of Vietnam. As the Japanese advance into Vietnam continues, Chinese troops' attacks on Japanese bases along the Chinese border continue. It was also stated that Japanese troops are currently continuing to withdraw their troops stationed in Guangdong, such as those stationed along the Hong Kong border and in Shenzhen. Japanese troops stationed in Nantou, southwest of Shenzhen, are said to have boarded ships bound for Haiphong. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing: A Foreign Ministry spokesperson recently responded to reporters' inquiries as to whether France would resist Chinese troops entering Vietnam, stating that this question should be answered by the French. However, it would not be unreasonable to say that the French would not resist, because if Chinese troops entered Vietnam, they would certainly not act as invaders, but as friendly forces assisting Vietnam and France. The spokesperson also stated that the French side has not formally invited Chinese assistance. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Hanoi: French authorities have urgently appealed to Tokyo to send a special envoy to Vietnam to stop the continued southward advance of Japanese troops from South China, as French troops are not resisting the advancing Japanese troops. This urgent request from France came after Major General Nishihara of the Japanese delegation failed to curb the southward advance. The advancing Japanese troops had entered Lang Son from Guangxi Province and now appear to be advancing towards Hanoi. Coincidentally, as the French authorities made an urgent request for Tokyo to mediate the local situation, the French government decided to protest to the Japanese government because six Japanese planes flew over Hanoi this morning, believing that the Japanese violated the agreement reached on Sunday after the disarmament of the French troops. The Chinese Consul in Hanoi, Mr. Zeng, has left Hanoi with his staff, and all Chinese banks in the area have also closed their doors. French authorities expressed doubt about reports that Chinese troops had entered Vietnam. Official sources stated that the Vietnamese government will remain in Hanoi, at least for the time being, but it is expected that the Vietnamese government will eventually have to relocate unless Japanese troops from South China cease their advance towards Hanoi. Japanese troops continued to land their troops and equipment in Haiphong today, and according to the Hanoi Agreement, 6,000 troops will be stationed there. Although no date has been set regarding the permission for the Japanese to occupy three airfields, the Japanese will take over these airfields in a short time. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

French Protest Bombing of Haiphong; Japanese Officer Expresses Apology

Hanoi officials issued a communiqué last night stating that the situation in the Lang Son area has not changed. Japanese troops landed at the port of Haiphong and proceeded to their garrison locations. The process was quite peaceful and in accordance with the spirit of the Franco-Japanese military agreement of the 22nd. The Japanese general commanding the landing troops apologized to the French authorities for the bombing of Haiphong by Japanese planes yesterday morning, stating that the pilots had not been ordered to do so and acted independently. According to reports, the bombing yesterday morning resulted in the death of 15 residents and the injury of 18 residents. The French authorities deemed it an "inexplicable hostile act" and immediately lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Haiphong: The Vietnamese authorities have lodged a serious protest with Japan regarding the bombing of Haiphong. Yesterday, before the Japanese landed in Haiphong in accordance with the Hanoi Agreement, Japanese planes appeared over Haiphong and dropped several bombs, causing casualties among the Vietnamese residents in the city. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Hanoi: Japanese military authorities formally apologized to French officials in Annam yesterday for the bombing of Haiphong. According to the Hanoi Agreement, 2,000 Japanese troops landed in Haiphong yesterday. Prior to the landing of the troops, Haiphong was bombed. Japanese officials stated that the bombing of Haiphong was a complete mistake, and they deeply regretted the deaths of 15 local people. According to foreign reports from Haiphong last night, the unprovoked bombing of the city by the Japanese was inexplicable. All French troops, except those necessary for defense, had been evacuated in advance. Even when the Japanese planes circled over the city, French anti-aircraft batteries did not fire a single shot until the Japanese air force had dropped four bombs, and then the French were forced to resist. The Japanese bombing of Haiphong yesterday morning fortunately did not cause chaos, but many residents packed their belongings and fled the city. The damage caused by the Japanese bombers was not extensive, only destroying several straw huts of poor residents. After the bombing of Haiphong, two more squadrons of Japanese planes, each containing eight planes, circled over the city. These planes did not drop bombs. Japanese troops began to land at dawn yesterday, actually landing in two locations outside Haiphong, and then walked into the city, arriving at their destination around noon. The landing Japanese troops were carrying heavy loads and looked dejected and exhausted under the scorching sun. Some stragglers rode rickshaws, following behind the troops. It is reported that the number of Japanese troops who arrived in Haiphong "for the purpose of defense" far exceeds the number of French and Annamese guards stationed in various cities in Annam. It is reported that another 4,000 Japanese troops will land before the end of this week. In addition to the dog squadrons and aircraft escorting them in the air, there were also a dozen tanks accompanying the Japanese troops who landed yesterday. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Vichy Claims Japan-France Agreement Has Been Suspended

Vichy: Officials of the Petain government declared last night that the Franco-Japanese agreement allowing Japan to obtain bases in Vietnam must be suspended indefinitely due to Japan's invasion of Vietnam. Officials stated that the French government entered into the agreement with the Japanese authorities in good faith and intended to maintain it to the end, but Japan violated the agreement by attacking French troops and invading Vietnam, so the original conditions of the agreement cannot be applied. Before the situation is resolved, Japan cannot obtain bases in Vietnam. The government also stated that the war in Vietnam is still ongoing, contrary to reports from the Japanese side. (International News Service dispatch, 27th)

London: The Manchester Guardian commented on the situation in Vietnam, stating that the Vichy government is only making concessions. The question now is whether the Japanese government will be satisfied with the major concessions granted by the formal agreement. The Times stated that Vietnam occupies the most important military position in the Far East, and the fate of the Far East is not something that Britain and the United States can ignore. If Vichy takes a firm stand and refuses Japan's demands, it will certainly not be isolated and helpless. The extent of the current concessions has not been made public, but it is certain that a new and serious threat to the Burma Road has begun. Anyone who knows the tactics of Tokyo does not believe that the reduction of French territory in Asia will be limited to the points mentioned in the Franco-Japanese agreement. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Tokyo: A joint communiqué regarding the Vietnam agreement was issued here today, stating that Japan has assured France that it respects France's sovereignty and territorial integrity in Vietnam. Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma declined to specify the scope of Japanese military activities in Vietnam under the agreement, saying whether there are any restrictions. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing: Newspapers here have published the news of the US loan to China in large headlines, and expect that as a result of the Japanese invasion of Vietnam, the United States will take new and important measures to deal with the Far Eastern situation. The newspapers have all strongly criticized the Vichy government. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Extension of Ten Years

London: China has extended the term of the lease of certain houses and facilities on Liugong Island in Weihaiwei Port to the British Navy for another ten years from October 1, 1940. This matter was completed this year with the exchange of documents by the British Ambassador. In peacetime, Weihaiwei is used as a rest and recreation area for British naval personnel in the Far East. Due to the ongoing war in Europe, British naval personnel do not have the same opportunity to use it, but some soldiers are still stationed there to take care of the leasing and renewal of houses on Liugong Island, as stated in the Sino-British Treaty on the Return of Weihaiwei on April 19, 1930.

### Hull's Statement: US Far East Policy Unchanged; If Japan Does Not Change its Attitude, the Scope of Embargoes Will Expand

Washington: Secretary of State Hull recently declared that the fundamental policy of the United States Navy to keep the main fleet stationed in Hawaii has not changed. Hull declined to comment on the embargo on scrap iron, except to say that he believed it was the desire of most Americans. When asked about the US general policy on Japan's territorial expansion program in the Far East, Hull reiterated his statement of foreign policy issued on July 16, 1937, when Japan launched its invasion of China. Hull also said that the United States continues to firmly maintain its previous claims. He said, "If any country undermines them, then they should be held accountable." At the same time, a State Department spokesman said that he had not heard that US Ambassador to Japan Grew had been recalled. He also pointed out that Washington had recently denied this news. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Washington: It has been learned here that White House Secretary O'Leary revealed last night that President Roosevelt is constantly discussing the Far Eastern situation with Secretary of State Hull over the phone. President Roosevelt had previously declared an embargo on scrap iron and steel materials to countries outside the Western Hemisphere, but the United Kingdom should be excluded. This embargo will take effect on October 15. When President Roosevelt made the above announcement, he stated that the United States had to issue this embargo order in order to conserve its own supply needs. However, according to the White House Secretary, President Roosevelt is deeply concerned about the Far Eastern crisis caused by the Japanese invasion of Annam and the jurisdictional dispute over the Shanghai Concession. As for whether the future embargo scope will be expanded to include various gasolines, O'Leary said that there is no news at the moment, but outside speculation believes that it is possible. According to the impression gained last night from the most well-informed sources here, the US loan to China and the simultaneous order prohibiting the export of scrap iron do not fully represent the response steps planned by the United States as a result of Japan's destruction of the status quo in Annam and Shanghai. Although it was not explicitly stated when the embargo order was issued that the order was extremely related to the Far Eastern situation, O'Leary's tone clearly indicated that this move was undoubtedly aimed at Japan.

US Bans Steel Shipments to Japan; Congressional Leaders Unanimously Approve

Washington: President Roosevelt's order yesterday to ban steel shipments has now received widespread support from Congressional leaders. Congressman Sheehan of the Western and Nier Democratic Parties said that the President's action, "if it has" good reason, is very legitimate. We should not deal with Japan alone, but when we feel that there is a legitimate reason to implement it, we should implement it ourselves. Therefore, I express my approval of the President's move. Congressman Mace, a Republican from Minnesota, believes that this embargo will increase Japan's aggression, and advocates that the United States should immediately adopt further and stronger measures. Mace said that this blockade is accelerating Japan's efforts to seize the Dutch East Indies. If we intend to implement a blockade on any items, we should do it thoroughly, and prohibit the transportation of all goods, including gold, to and from Japan. Senator Capehart, a Republican from Kansas, said this is a "good action, I very much agree and hope that it can be implemented for a long time." Senator Wiley, a Republican from Wisconsin, predicted that this embargo will bring Japan and Germany closer, "but in terms of the path we are following, it is a reasonable step. The overall impact of this action can only be known in the future." Congressman Crawford, a Republican from Michigan, said that in view of Japan's expansion policy, the entire Far Eastern situation depends on whether the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies are in danger. However, he also said that he does not feel that the blockade will increase the danger of the Dutch East Indies and other places. On the question of whether the embargo would increase danger to the other areas in the Far East, which some members of Congress endorsed by supporting the embargo, Crawford said, "The Philippines and the Dutch East Indies are inherently dangerous, but President Roosevelt's actions do not seem to increase that danger, because Japan has already decided to implement its territorial expansion policy, and it will do so no matter where it is. I am heartily convinced of the President's move and have long hoped for it. Our work of helping Japan destroy China has been greater than any other country in the world. I am very pleased that we are taking practical action today in place of empty words." (United Press dispatch, 27th)

Tokyo: The right-wing newspaper "Kokumin Shimbun" today published an article severely criticizing the US loan to China and the ban on scrap iron shipments to Japan, saying that if Britain and the United States continue to take a groundless anti-Japanese stance, they will be hit hard, and not only in Burma and Singapore. "Tokyo Shimbun" published an article titled "Battle for Supremacy in the Pacific," saying that Vietnam is only a small corner of the great duel that is currently developing between Japan and the United States. Britain is also clearly involved in this matter, in order to recover the losses suffered in Europe. The relatively moderate "Asahi Shimbun" said that the conflict between Japan and the United States now seems unavoidable. We welcome the United States to decide its actions in a firm state, instead of using slow methods to persecute Japan. American hostility towards Japan is increasing, and the pressure applied to Japan is increasing, which is actually a test of the Japanese people's determination to resist. The newspaper admitted that the new overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are all prepared to make all sacrifices to help Japan's national policy. "It reported that Mr. Gunji had returned to Yokohama earlier in the week." (United Press dispatch, 27th)

American Legion Convention Resolves: Urges Government to Fully Aid China

Boston: The American Legion held a convention last night. After vigorous debate on foreign policy, it advocated full aid to Britain and China, except for war. Those who advocated American neutrality and non-intervention in foreign affairs were stopped by the public. A motion was then passed by a majority, opposing any declaration advocating neutrality, marking a change in the American Legion's policy, which had not changed for sixteen years. The motion declared, "To the British people who are defending the coast and freedom, and to the heroic Republic of China, we extend assurances of friendship and sympathy." The motion also urged the US government to take all legal steps to stop the transport of war materials to aggressor nations, and to continue to provide full cooperation to the peoples of all nations resisting aggression, as is consistent with their safety, freedom, and peaceful responsibilities.

### Japan's Steel Dependence on the United States: Imports Reach 525,000 Tons in Seven Months This Year

Washington - According to statistics from the Department of Commerce, Japan's purchases of scrap iron and steel from the United States in the first seven months of this year have reached one-third of all U.S. production. The total amount of U.S. exports at that time was just over 1,796,000 tons, of which 525,000 tons were shipped to Japan alone. The United Kingdom also purchased 599,000 tons. In the same period in 1939, U.S. exports totaled 2,123,000 tons, with 1,155,000 tons going to Japan and only 254,000 tons to the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, commercial sources revealed that China has shipped as much as 3,750 tons of tungsten ore to the United States in repayment of debts. This shipment of tungsten ore is more than three times the amount imported last year and approximately twenty-five times more than the amount China shipped to the United States in 1938.

### American Pacific Policy

— By John Gunther, originally published in "Foreign Affairs"

Following the Japanese army's landing in French Indochina, Germany, Italy, and Japan immediately established a military alliance, inevitably intensifying the situation in the Pacific. This newspaper now translates and publishes an article on American Pacific policy so that readers can gain insight into America's position in this issue. The continuation of "European War Talks" will be published successively later.

The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world's five oceans. Its widest point from east to west is nearly 10,000 miles, and its widest point from north to south is 7,000 miles. Its area of 68 million square miles accounts for half of the Earth's entire sea surface. Within it are three British territories: Canada, Australia, and New Zealand; twelve republics including the United States; the 4,072 volcanic islands that constitute Japan; and also China, the Philippine Islands, and the Dutch East Indies. Along the edge of the North Pacific, the Soviet Union and the United States are separated by less than sixty miles. It is a vast warehouse of goods and commerce, a necessary passage for various trades, a stage for all sorts of risky plays in national policy, and also a focal point for unresolved disputes.

The United States' attitude toward the Far East and Pacific issues is governed by three distinct policies. These three policies are: (1) the Open Door Policy proclaimed by John Hay in 1899. The simplest definition of this policy is that all people of all countries who wish to trade with China enjoy equal opportunities. (2) The Washington Treaties of 1921-1922. According to the naval treaty, the major naval powers agreed to maintain a certain naval ratio. The United States also promised in the Four-Power Treaty not to change the status quo of the defense zones and military bases in the western Pacific, while Japan also promised in the Nine-Power Treaty to respect China's territorial integrity. Although this treaty was broken by Japan long ago, the United States still adheres to it. (3) The Stimson Doctrine of non-recognition. This policy was announced after Japan occupied Manchuria in 1931, declaring that the United States would not recognize any situation, treaty, or agreement that violates the terms of the Kellogg-Briand Pact.

Every country has five types of boundaries. First, within the country, is the geographical boundary. Second, equally or exceeding the geographical boundary in scope, according to the country's area and strength, becomes the military boundary, which is the boundary defended by the strength of the army, navy, and air force. Third, is the economic boundary. For example, the economic boundary of the United States certainly includes Brazilian coffee and Bolivian tin. Fourth, is the diplomatic boundary, mostly protecting the country's interests outside the geographical boundary, or responding to any danger that these interests may encounter. Fifth, is the moral boundary, which can be illustrated by phrases like "Open Door."

Generally speaking, a country's diplomatic boundary, at a certain period, can be used to represent that country's "policy," while the military boundary represents that country's "power" to defend that policy. The purpose of this article is to discuss what relationship these two boundaries have to the various interests of the United States in the Pacific.

American interests in the Pacific can be divided into several categories:

(1) Territorial: The United States holds several groups of islands in the Pacific, for example, the Hawaiian Islands, Guam, Midway Island, Wake Island, and part of the Samoan Islands. (The Philippines are not included because, according to the Tydings-McDuffie Act, the Philippines will no longer belong to the United States by 1946.)

(2) National: There are 7,000 American citizens residing in China and 8,000 in Japan. There are also many American residents in the Philippines, and a few in the Dutch East Indies and the Straits Settlements (estimated at 625 in the Dutch East Indies and 525 in the Straits Settlements). Among them, those residing in China are of greatest concern to the U.S. State Department.

(3) Investment: The exact amount of investment is not easy to ascertain. According to reasonable estimates, there are $250 million in China and $350 million in Japan. But the more Japan advances into China, the more the opportunity for American investment in China will be limited. In any case, the total amount of American investment in the Far East is $750 million, only about 6% of the total amount of American foreign investment.

(4) Trade: In 1938, the total amount of U.S. exports to China was $35 million, and the total amount of imports from China was $47 million. The total amount of U.S. exports to Japan, however, was very large, reaching nearly $240 million, and the total amount of imports from Japan (mostly silk and cotton goods) was $126.82 million. The majority of U.S. exports to Japan can be used as war materials, such as machinery, scrap iron, and gasoline. This action by the United States is tantamount to helping Japan attack China. As for the U.S. exports to the Philippines, the total amount reached $86 million, and the total amount of imports was $94 million.

(5) Aviation: Civil aviation not only follows existing trade routes but also opens up new routes, opening new doors for future trade. The Pacific air route operated by Pan American Airlines is very important, both in terms of commercial and national prestige value, and also has an obvious military benefit, because pilots not only receive training in flying over the Pacific Ocean, but also gain valuable information about the climate conditions over the Pacific Ocean. The bases constructed by the airline from America via Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, to Manila are of extreme military importance.

(6) Cultural: The United States has important interests in the cultural sphere, especially in China, such as Xiangya University, Peking Union Medical College, and countless other schools, churches, and hospitals. If the United States is unwilling to sacrifice these important and valuable interests, it can never abandon its political influence in the Far East.

(7) Political: The whole world is interconnected, especially in the Far East. In order to maintain its national power and prestige, the United States must assume political responsibility.

All of this is what the United States must defend. But in what position does the United States stand to defend it?

To answer this question, we must first discuss who is the United States' hypothetical enemy. In the current state of international politics, with respect to the Far East and the Pacific region, the United States' only hypothetical enemy is Japan. If Germany were to win the war in Europe, the situation would of course completely change. At that time, the U.S. defense must also be completely changed accordingly. But at present, the only thing the United States needs to fear in the Pacific is Japan. This is not to say that Japan intends to declare war on the United States on a certain day of a certain month in the future. Most sober-minded political commentators admit that such a risky move is currently unlikely. However, under the current circumstances, Japan is the only country that can threaten American interests in the Pacific, and the only power that can brew a Pacific war. Therefore, the United States should determine its military and naval policies in the Pacific based on this goal.

If war were to unfortunately break out between Japan and the United States, Japan's first step would be to strike at the unprotected American outposts in China. The U.S. troops stationed in China would be isolated and helpless. Since 1927, the United States has cooperated with other countries to protect the Shanghai International Settlement, where it has stationed 1,100 naval personnel. In North China, there are 5,000 U.S. Marines stationed in Beijing and Tianjin. There are four U.S. warships along the Yangtze River, and one in Guangzhou. The Asiatic Fleet, based in Shanghai or Manila, has only one 10,000-ton cruiser, one 7,000-ton old-fashioned cruiser, twelve outdated destroyers, twelve submarines, and some small auxiliary ships. The United States has not stationed any battleships or aircraft carriers in the Far East. In the past, it even did not station a fleet at the naval base in Hawaii, for fear of offending Japan. But now it is different, the United States has concentrated its entire fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

### British Planes Fly Over the Channel in Force, Heavily Bombing German Bases, Multiple Fires on French, Belgian, and Dutch Coasts, Power Station in Berlin Area Destroyed

London - Large numbers of British planes flew over to the European continent today, carrying out large-scale air raids, inflicting extremely heavy damage on the French, Belgian, and Dutch coasts. Since the British Air Force began attacking bases being prepared for the invasion of England, this has been the most intense. British bomber formations flew across the Channel in succession, like wave after wave. All German invasion bases along the European coast were bombed. British planes descended rapidly through the low-lying rain clouds, dropping large quantities of bombs, turning the Channel's fog into a mass of red light. Along hundreds of miles of the European coast, fires broke out everywhere. (International dispatch, 27th)

London - The British Royal Air Force, which has been actively attacking Germany and its occupied territories, again flew in a fan formation to the skies over Europe yesterday, increasing pressure every hour, reaching the largest air raid since the start of the war. The British air raids have greatly ravaged more than twenty important target European cities, including Berlin and the Kiel naval base. The British air raid speed has increased to the fastest. The targets that were bombed previously are still piles of rubble. Public notices state that the Germans have not had time to clear the rubble, and British planes have come to bomb again. According to returning British Air Force personnel, Berlin's two major power stations and the Tempelhof airfield have been reduced to rubble. It is rumored that the German first-class battleship "Schleswig-Holstein" was destroyed by British planes yesterday. The Kiel naval dockyard also suffered a major blow. German invasion ports in the English Channel were subjected to two daytime bombings by British planes. According to officials, ships in German ports suffered severe damage. (International dispatch, 27th)

London - Reuters - An air force correspondent said that the air offensive taken by the British Air Force against Germany is becoming more intense. In addition to dealing heavy blows to several invasion bases around the clock, the operational range is now being extended to remote areas of the German mainland. Within the twelve hours from sunset to dawn, British long-range aircraft flew all over the German mainland. This week, British giant aircraft flew within 55 miles of the Polish border to bomb a power station. Because long-range bombers are not protected by fighter escorts when they attack, daytime activities are strictly limited. However, medium-sized bombers have intensified their attacks within shorter distances during the day. Although the activities of British Air Force bombers have doubled, it is still the first step in strengthening the planned offensive. In the future, Churchill's words will be realized, reaching a level of intensity that was previously unimaginable. As British aircraft activity becomes more and more intense, it is expected that the bombing of military targets in Berlin and other major German cities will rapidly intensify. Currently, Berlin is only subjected to one air raid per night, because British planes have to fly 1,200 miles to attack, which is not as easy as German planes flying only 300 miles to attack. Comparing the destructive blows inflicted by the British Air Force on the German war machine with the efforts of the German air force to try to crush British industry and morale, it can be seen that the British Air Force's performance is far better than that of the German air force. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

London - The Ministry of Aviation issued a public announcement last night stating that all British planes that flew to Germany and the Channel last night to carry out attacks returned safely. British bombers flew over the Berlin area, bombing power stations, railway transportation, and the Tempelhof airfield. The Kiel shipyards and warehouses in Hanau-Kesselstadt were also quite successful, and ships and wharf storage depots in ports such as Antwerp and Dunkirk were also attacked. Also, a British coastal plane shot down an enemy bomber yesterday afternoon, which crashed into the sea. Last night, a squadron of British coastal planes bombed and set fire to oil tanks in Brest. Ships in the port were also severely damaged. During the attack on Kiel, a huge bomb dropped by a British plane landed at the north end of the shipyard and the shipyard. It was seen that the point where a bomb exploded was very close to the German cruiser "Scharnhorst," which was docked at the Kiel naval shipyard. The attack on Boulogne lasted three and a half hours, with many fierce explosions and fires breaking out, the flames illuminating the entire city, and visible from 50 miles away. According to reports from returning pilots, British planes dropped bombs with extraordinary accuracy, causing a great deal of damage. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Fierce Air Battle in British Skies Yesterday Morning, London and the Midlands Continue to Be Bombed, German Long-Range Guns Bomb Dover

London - Air raid alarms were sounded in the London area this morning. When enemy planes came, anti-aircraft guns densely bombarded them. It is now believed that ten enemy planes were shot down in London and its suburbs during the daytime air raid this morning. A squadron of twenty German planes attempted to fly to London from the southwest, but were repelled by anti-aircraft guns and turned southeast. British fighters attacked them, and a fierce battle broke out over the Surrey Hills. It is reported that during a certain air raid, a building in southern London was hit by a bomb, killing and injuring many people. Several bombs also fell in a southwestern area of London. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

London - A Ministry of Aviation announcement stated that German planes indiscriminately dropped bombs in London and its suburbs yesterday. A total of 34 German planes were destroyed in air battles. Last night's enemy air raids covered many parts of Britain, but the main centers were London and the surrounding areas, as well as the northwestern districts. Houses, shops, and factories were damaged, and there were fires in several places due to incendiary bombs. There were slight casualties among the people. In a certain city in southeastern England, several houses were destroyed and there were very few casualties. Two British pilots who were previously reported missing are now safe and sound. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

London - The scope of German aircraft activity in British skies yesterday was very limited. However, the number of German aircraft destroyed by British fighters still reached 31, including 15 bombers. The British also lost 8 fighters, but 3 of the pilots were safe and sound. According to a public announcement from the Air Ministry, the German air force made its first attempt to send a squadron of bombers to invade British skies during the day since its defeat in the attack on Britain on the 15th of this month. However, German air activity was very limited again yesterday. In the morning, enemy planes approached the east and south coasts of Britain, mostly flying singly, but few ventured far inland. Bombs fell in two places on the northeast coast, with slight loss of life and property. There were very few casualties. In the afternoon, several ports along the Channel between Hastings and Southampton were attacked, with some damage to property and some casualties. A certain town in the Midlands also had bombs dropped, destroying several houses and causing minor casualties. British fighters drove off a large squadron of enemy planes. No enemy planes were seen over the London area, but enemy planes were found in the area of an airfield at the mouth of the Thames, causing two short-term alarms in London. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

Berlin - Last night, this agency learned from the responsible authorities that German planes dropped bombs and bombed throughout Britain yesterday. In air battles, 15 British planes were shot down, and only 3 German planes were missing. Military targets in southern England and the northeastern part of the Midlands suffered Eastern wounds. Several bombs hit the famous Spitfire factory in Southampton. The Filton aircraft factory continued to be attacked yesterday morning, and hangars and railway connections were hit by giant bombs, causing many fires and heavy damage. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)

Berlin - German planes bombed military targets in London, Birkenhead, and Southampton last night, dropping a total of 400 tons of bombs. 250 tons of bombs were dropped in London alone. In addition, the German planes also bombed warehouses in Liverpool. (General dispatch, 27th)

(Article 5) In places with sufficient funds, a special budget should be allocated from the city and county education funds to be used as incentive savings for elementary school teachers. When elementary school teachers set aside a portion of their own salary as savings, the county (city) government should give appropriate subsidies and store them together. (Article 6) In places with sufficient funds, a special budget should be allocated from the city and county education funds to be used as retirement savings for elementary school teachers. At ordinary times, the city and county government should add a percentage of the teacher's monthly salary and deposit it on their behalf. At the time of retirement, it will be given in full.

In the Yinqian Cup Ping Pong Tournament, Chu Hui played against Zhejiang Xing, the third-place finisher from last year, at the China Storage Bank's ball room. After the start of the match, Chu Hui played very smoothly, taking an absolute advantage of eight to one. Zhejiang Xing was also a strong team, but they were careless at the beginning and lost many points. Under stimulation, they were careful and gradually caught up in points, tying the score at twelve to twelve. The two sides fought fiercely. In the last game, Wu Zhaofeng, a veteran of Zhejiang, launched a desperate counterattack, with accurate smashes.

### Financial Market Turbulent and Unpredictable

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices announced, with the British pound at 0.625, calculated at three and a half shillings and 4375, and the U.S. dollar at 1.875, calculated at five yuan and 25 cents. The rest also saw a slight increase. The unofficial market for the British and U.S. currencies initially eased slightly before becoming very tight. This was due to a telegram from Hong Kong indicating that the current shilling was reaching 30 pounds, and HSBC and the Bank of Japan were also involved in buying. Although there was some selling among Chinese banks, the disparity between supply and demand was huge. In the afternoon, there was news of a German-Italian alliance, and the market became even tighter. The British gold rate once fell to three and a half shillings and 484375, and the U.S. dollar retreated to five yuan and 34375. Later, the situation eased slightly as the buying telegrams from Hong Kong stopped. As a result, the British rate tightened by 0.046875, calculated at three and a half shillings, and the U.S. rate softened by 0.03125, calculated at five yuan and 375.

After opening, the market tightened as the Bank of Japan, Chinese banks, and foreign banks came to buy. Although speculators and U.S. banks had sold at that time, the market ultimately tightened. The ten-month U.S. dollar rate was five yuan and 4375 and 375. HSBC announced the British pound at 0.625 and the U.S. dollar at 1.875. There were no changes announced for the silver balance tax.

At the same time, HSBC also absorbed spot British gold from Chinese banks at three and a half shillings and U.S. dollars for this month at five yuan and 40625. Later, the Bank of Japan bought U.S. dollars for September from foreign banks at five yuan and 375. As the buying subsided, the situation eased. By the close, the British gold rate was three and a half shillings, and the U.S. dollar rate was five yuan and 375.

The Market Eases Slightly in the Afternoon

The market initially remained tight in the afternoon. Due to the news of a German-Italian alliance, the U.S. dollar opened at only five yuan and 34375, and the British gold rate returned to flat. Later, the Hong Kong bank bought spot U.S. dollars from foreign banks at five yuan and 375 and 34375. At that time, spot British gold could only be settled at three and a half shillings and 484375.

As a result, the market eased. By the close, the British gold rate was three and a half shillings, and the U.S. dollar rate was five yuan and 375. The ten-month British gold rate was three and a half shillings and 484375, and the U.S. dollar rate was five yuan and 34375.

### Foreign Exchange Buying Wind Increases, Gold Prices Rebound

Yesterday, the local market for raw gold saw a sharp rise after an initial decline. The price has returned to outside the 6,100 yuan mark. In the midst of active U.S. economic aid to China and the maintenance of the foreign exchange rate, a telegram from Hong Kong came, pouring in 300,000 pounds of British gold, and Chinese and Japanese banks scrambled to buy U.S. dollars. The foreign exchange rate suddenly tightened, which stimulated people's enthusiasm. The opening price in the morning was 6,060 yuan, which then fell by another 20 yuan. This was because the opening foreign exchange rate was slightly tight. Subsequently, the exchange market suddenly tightened, and gold shops competed to buy. In addition, silver shops followed suit to cover their short positions, and the selling voices on the floor disappeared. Before the close, the price had risen to 6,130 yuan. Later, news of a German-Italian alliance was spread, and the buying momentum became stronger. Silver shops continued to cover their short positions and once reached a high of 6,143 yuan. However, the foreign exchange rate suddenly stopped loosening and turned flat. Buyers decreased at 3:00 PM, and the price fell back by 30 to 40 yuan. But in the end, the buying momentum of the securities firms continued unabated, so the closing price was still 6,120 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the closing price rose by 52 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 4,000 taels. Silver jewelry shops increased their listed prices by 10 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained flat.

Raw Gold Rebounds by 52 Yuan

Although the foreign exchange market was loose in the early morning, people's sentiment was still stable, and most were willing to buy at the opening price. Therefore, the opening price only decreased by 8 yuan under the competition of buyers. Gold shops traded 20 taels between themselves at 6,080 yuan. Then, because silver shops increased their short positions, the price continued to fall by 20 yuan, once as low as 6,040 yuan. Suddenly, the exchange market tightened, and a certain silver shop stopped selling and aggressively bought. In addition, the gold shops had a strong appetite for buying, and money changers also dragged in a considerable amount. The price soon rose to 6,110 yuan. Later, a certain money changer came out and sold, and retail investors also followed suit, and the price fell back to 6,090 yuan. After 11:00 AM, the foreign exchange rate continued to tighten, and a certain silver shop came to aggressively cover its short positions. At that time, securities firms and silver shops also absorbed each other. Before the close, the price rose to 6,130 yuan. However, because the silver shops turned from buying to selling, the closing price was 6,115 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon increased by 10 yuan, and securities firms sold 20 taels to gold shops at 6,125 yuan. Later, the price fell to 6,120 yuan. Before long, securities firms came to buy again, and silver shops were also eager to cover their short positions. The price once rose to 6,113 yuan. Later, traders suddenly decreased, and the price fell back immediately. Not long after, a certain silver shop came to short again. For a time, there was a lack of maintenance, and the price fell to 6,105 yuan. After entering the market, the price was pulled up again by securities firms and rose to 6,125 yuan. The closing price was 6,120 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the price rebounded by 52 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 103 yuan. The selling price of gold from cash gold shops was a dozen yuan higher than that of raw gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Prices Also Increased by 10 Yuan

Silver jewelry shops initially did not change the selling price per tael. By noon, the price was increased by 10 yuan. The Datong Bank changed its listed price to 630 yuan. The new banks had the same price as the previous price, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Show Different Trends

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slight increase in raw gold prices. The British and U.S. gold pounds also increased by one yuan each. The need for British gold notes decreased sharply, and the market price fell back by 3 jiao. U.S. gold notes initially continued to soften and once fell to 18 yuan and 2.5 jiao. Later, because HSBC had a strong appetite for black market U.S. dollars, people's sentiment increased, and the market price rose step by step, once rising to 18 yuan and 5.3 jiao. The final price was 18 yuan and 4.8 jiao, an increase of 8 fen compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate was slightly weak by 1 fen. The supply of Japanese gold notes suddenly became strong, and the market price weakened. The night market price fell to 1 yuan and 4.9 jiao. The supply and demand of Korean notes remained even, and the market price remained flat. The night market price remained at the original price of 1 yuan and 1.8 jiao.

### Shanghai Banks Continue to Reduce Interest Rates

The banking community in the city, in view of the excessive floating capital and high deposits in the Shanghai market this month, and the difficult operation of the market, is suffering from an unsustainable burden on deposit interest rates. In order to reduce losses, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank reduced interest rates previously, and now the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank is responding, and has also announced to all depositors that from October 1st of this year, all current account holders of the bank will be calculated at a monthly interest rate of 2%, (Ben).

### Food - Foreign Rice Once Stirred Up, and the Rising Trend of Japonica Rice Was Not Killed

Yesterday, foreign rice lingered for several days. It was generally believed that the base was solid and the market was active. The situation soon tightened, and short covering was frequent. Sellers' shouts were raised immediately. However, the underlying price was already expensive, and the source was endless. The Annam issue did not attract the attention of non-industry hoarders. As for the actual sales, there was no smooth appetite for a long time. Therefore, the result was only a pull-up of 5, 6, or 7 jiao. Even the original English-Hua Si package did not have a new large account consultant. More than 100 tons were opened yesterday. Saigon No. 2 was 77 yuan and 7 jiao, 7 jiao higher than the previous day. Siam No. 2 was 77 yuan and a half, also half a yuan higher. The daily spot rice transaction was 7,000 bags. The market price was 70 yuan, Saigon No. 2 was 66 yuan, Siam No. 2 was 64 yuan and 3 jiao, 64 yuan, Xiao Jiao was 64 yuan, and Mi Lu was 56 yuan.

The supply and demand of glutinous rice were similar, and there were no gains or losses. The arrival of thick and thin japonica rice was still interrupted, resulting in a strong trend that has not been killed, and is still rising. The prices continued to increase by one yuan. Kai Chang bang Su Jing was 84 yuan and 5 jiao, and the next one, Su Jing, was 81 yuan and 2 jiao. Thin rice has not been opened. The original Nan Gang package of early rice was 83 yuan and 4 yuan, the market price was 83 yuan and a half, and it was decided to be about 80 yuan.

The arrival of new japonica rice was also reduced, with a total of only 200 to 300 bags. Therefore, it followed the other goods and was raised across the board. Kai Zhuanqiao new japonica rice was 77 yuan, the market price for Taicang Jiading sheep tip was 66 yuan and a half, 66 yuan, and the Qingjiao Du tip was 68 yuan.

### Flour and Wheat Stable

Flour was stable yesterday. Hua flour mills remained unchanged, and even the Japanese street remained unchanged. The demand was quite good, and the supply from various factories increased slightly, but the current flour was still in short supply. However, the returning goods were affected by the large transaction of foreign flour. The price of Phoenix brand current flour was similar to the factory price, and it was difficult to transport into the concession. The factory was also not very welcome in this street. The factory flour price still needed 18 yuan and 35 jiao. Due to the arrival of goods from Qingdao and rumors of unified control, the appetite for sales in North China also turned sluggish. Therefore, the market was unusually flat, and the rising trend of the flour market gradually subsided.

The wheat market was flat yesterday. The goods arriving from the mainland were mostly designated to be sent to Japanese factories and priced according to the market price. The goods side always thought about improving the price, but it was difficult to achieve. The transport of Japanese flour to the market has entered a smooth path. The wheat market has also slightly improved. The amount received by Japanese factories was only 1,000 to 2,000 bags. Chinese factories did not absorb it because foreign wheat had arrived. The prices of various goods also had few gains or losses.

### Securities - Domestic Bonds Rise Sharply with Small Corrections, Foreign Bonds Show Mixed Trends

Yesterday's market conditions for unified public bonds showed a trend of rising sharply and correcting slightly over the past few days. The price was approaching the new high point of September 10th. Although it once rose sharply due to the success of the Sino-U.S. loan, it inevitably caused speculators to sell off at high prices. It was believed that the market price was rising too fast, so most of the floating profits were released. It was inevitable that the market sentiment would turn sluggish and weak due to the selling pressure. However, due to the abundance of floating capital and the reduction of interest rates by banks, it still did not escape the trend of rising more and falling less. The opening price in the morning was initially firm due to the absorption and pull-up of Lianhe Hongda Xinfu No. 16 and No. 7, etc. However, in an instant, Kanglian Yida Tong No. 11 and others poured out aggressively, resulting in a blow. The market price was unable to persist and became a straight line downward. In the afternoon, No. 6, No. 16, and Xinfu continued to pay in, while Lianyi Shuntai Tongkang Hongda sold out. The market conditions were clearer, and the price continued to decline slightly during the rotation. The result was a unanimous reduction of a small half yuan to 7 jiao, with a transaction volume of 1.2 million yuan.

In stock trading, 30 shares of the Bank of China were traded at a price of 68 yuan.

Yesterday, most of the transactions in the public stock market were for covering short positions and settling floating profits. Because the transaction volume this week was unusually large, the forces of both the long and short sides were evenly matched. The outcome of yesterday's decisive battle was difficult to determine which side had the advantage. There were few changes in the news, and the prices of each stock were generally very stable, except for a few that fluctuated due to the competition between the long and short sides.

London, 16th (Thursday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks showed mixed trends. Chinese railway foreign debt, including the Beining Railway public bond, increased by 3 pounds to a price of 41 pounds. The Daoqing Railway public bond also increased by 1 pound to a price of 10 pounds. The Hukuang Railway non-German bond remained at 12 pounds. In addition, the German bond and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway public bond each fell by 1 pound. The price of the Hukuang German bond was 10 pounds, and the price of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was 6 pounds. Among the Far East stocks, the stock of the Mai Jia Li Bank continued to rise by 1 shilling and 3 pence to a price of 6 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence. The bearer stock of the Kaiping Coal Mine fell by 1 shilling to a price of 14 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

### Although Yarn Sales Are Weak, Cotton Yarn Still Expected to Be Good, Yesterday's Market Wanted to Fall but Rose Again

The yarn market, which had been up and down a lot the previous day, entered a firm and rising path again yesterday. This was actually because after rising for several consecutive days, a portion of profit-takers came out, causing the surface to loosen slightly, and the market took the opportunity to fall back. However, recently, major players and those with funds have again become optimistic about the rise in yarn prices, so the amount of absorption is not only unwilling to sell, but there are still measures to increase the price when it is low. As a result, the situation is still upright, but sales are not as enthusiastic as on the day.

In the morning, the single of the general "gun cap" opened low, and the main helpers were those who scooped in, so they shouted in unison. However, the sellers were reluctant to sell in view of this situation. The transaction price was 1,068 yuan, and then the buyers flocked in, and most of them wanted to be good, rising to 1,077 yuan, which was the most prosperous transaction. It rose again to 1,082 yuan. At this time, it was heard that current sales were sluggish, and it fell again to 1,075 yuan. The closing price was 1,078 yuan. The statistical statistics of the amount of transactions from various gangkou in the first half of the day are listed as follows:

同行 (Same Trade) 2,720 香港 (Hong Kong) 365 統計 (Statistics) 3,085

### It Is Rumored That The Mortgage For American Cotton Will Be Increased

The current cotton situation is firm, because people are mostly optimistic about the future. The reasons for this are nothing more than the difficulty in transporting new cotton. However, the British and Germans are bombing each other fiercely, the European market has stalled, and Indian cotton has to find a way out to the East. If the foreign exchange is lengthened, the price of Indian cotton is still expected to become cheaper. Therefore, the factory's demand is not strong, transactions are not prosperous, and the market price is also rising in a roundabout way.

Another message: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market initially rose due to purchases by speculators, and then because of good spot trading, and a part of the government will increase the mortgage for cotton, so the industry's purchases were unusually enthusiastic. As a result, the closing price was 8, 9, and more than 10 pounds higher than the previous day. India, including the top measurement, fell by one rupee.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading became quieter again yesterday. This is still because the stock on the market is not abundant, and the industry plans to wait for a good price. Although the factory's intention to purchase is strong, it strongly wants to search for those with low selling prices, so it has not been able to purchase them.

### Oil Market - Both Crude Soybean Oil Prices Are Rising

Yesterday's spot crude soybean oil market price jumped another yuan. The market price of actual crude soybean oil is very different, and the soybean oil chips are very short. Although the arrival and storage of peanut oil are both thick, there are Tin Chang Zhen Yang inland rivers and other places that are secretly transporting, so the general bullish fortifications are extremely strong. The trend of futures fluctuates quite a lot in one day, and it is estimated that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at a price of 76 yuan, 50 pieces of Qi soybean oil were traded at a price of 78 yuan, 100 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were traded at a price of 104 yuan, and 1,200 dan of Dayou factory soybean oil were traded at a price of 85 yuan to 86 yuan.

The opening price turned down to 70 yuan and 7 and a half jiao, and then rose again to 72 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 71 yuan and 7 and a half jiao.

### Northern and Southern Goods: Dongzhi (Winter Solstice) Seafood Rises Five to Six Yuan

Not many Haikou branches (a type of seafood) have arrived recently. The amount of goods in the hands of traders is also limited, so the market trend has tightened. Yesterday, northern and southern goods dealers opened more than a thousand boxes. Top-quality products, like Dongzhi seafood, rose by five to six yuan, with other grades rising by one or two yuan by varying degrees.

### Seafood: Limited Stock of Qicai Seaweed

The supply and demand for Qicai seaweed had been balanced in the previous market, with stable prices. Recently, the supply source has not been sustained.

Indian dust is now priced at 160 yuan per load, Kailuan No. 2 dust at 145 yuan, and Boshan dust at 140 yuan, ex-warehouse, with barging costs extra.

### Metals: Brisk Trading in White Iron Sheet and Nails

Yesterday, white iron sheet experienced a sudden increase in market activity. In previous days, there were inquiries from merchants from the northern routes, and there were also many purchases from local construction companies. The market situation suddenly felt lively, and trading prices followed suit and increased. Yesterday's market asking prices were: 7-foot sheets required 7 yuan 75 cents; 6-foot sheets also required 6 yuan 75 cents. Both were up by 10.5 cents from the previous prices. It is estimated that a total of 4,000 sheets were traded.

The market for factory nails has flourished since the purchase by the Yantai merchants. In addition, the Tianjin merchants have also recently shown interest in searching for goods, so the market atmosphere is quite good. Standard prices have therefore soared. Yesterday's market price was 55 yuan, with Bessemer steel up by about 2 or 3 yuan from before, it is said.

### Early Restoration of Public Transportation: Chinese Director Willing to Mediate: British Tram and Labor Opinions Approaching Agreement: Public Bus Yesterday in Negotiation

After the workers of the British Tram Company in the International Settlement, the Chinese Public Bus Company, and the French Water and Electricity Company in the French Concession successively went on strike, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent letters to the Public Works Department and various companies, hoping to seek a reasonable solution quickly. It is heard that both labor and management have expressed respect for the Chamber of Commerce's opinions. The labor side has prepared procedures and will request the Public Works Department's Chinese Directors, Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, and the Industrial Section to mediate. New Sound News reporters inquired with Yu Qiaqing and the Industrial Section yesterday. As of last night, no formal request from the workers had been received. They expressed their willingness to accept the mediation issue in order to resolve the public utility strike turmoil as soon as possible, so as to maintain public transportation and social order within the Settlement.

British Tram Expected to Resolve

After the workers of the British Tram Company went on strike on the 20th of this month, although two negotiations were held, the issue of increasing wages could not be resolved. Now that both labor and management are willing to negotiate in good faith, it is hoped that the strike turmoil will be resolved satisfactorily. It is heard that regarding the four preconditions put forward by the workers, the company has agreed to increase the allowance by 20 cents and the rice subsidy by 15 cents for the first condition (a total of 10 yuan and 5 cents per month calculated on a 30-day basis), while the workers have conceded to 13 yuan. For the second condition, workers shall not be dismissed without cause, the company has agreed to accept it. For the third condition, wages during the strike period, the company agrees to pay for two days. For the fourth condition, labor and management conditions both agree to temporarily reserve them.

Public Bus Meeting Yesterday

After the strike of the British Public Bus in the Public Concession on the 24th, there has been no contact between labor and management for several days. Because of the harmonious relationship between the two sides, there is no sign of expansion of the strike. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, 12 representatives of the labor side went to the company's head office at No. 111 Sassoon House on the Bund, Nanjing Road, to meet with Zhang Delan, the traffic manager representing the company. The labor representatives presented the four preconditions decided at the meeting on the 24th to the company and expressed the labor side's willingness to negotiate in good faith out of desperation, so as to obtain a reasonable solution. Zhang Delan expressed that the company has always been concerned about the stable life of the labor side and sought ways to improve it, so it deeply understands the current strike. However, he has no power to decide on the proposed conditions and promised to convene a board meeting in the evening to discuss them and agreed to listen to the news at 9:00 AM today. The labor representatives then left. The discussions were close to agreement, so it is expected that if the company's reply today is satisfactory, the two sides will be able to start formal negotiations in the afternoon to discuss the method of resuming work first, and transportation may be restored within one or two days.

French Tram Negotiations in Progress

After the workers of the French Water and Electricity Company put forward 16 conditions for improving their treatment, the union has formally dispatched four representatives to the company for negotiations. After the conditions have been translated into French and carefully considered, a reply will be given. It is heard that the workers believe that the 16 conditions put forward are all based on facts and peaceful requests, and the company should give reasonable approval; otherwise, the management should bear full responsibility. As for trams on Routes 2, 7, and 10, they continued to operate and pick up passengers yesterday morning under the protection of armed police. The Lujiawan headquarters and factory, as well as the stations on each route, were still guarded by Chinese and Vietnamese police, providing strict protection. At 11:55 yesterday noon, three trams on Routes 2 and 7 were bombed at the intersection of Avenue Joffre, injuring eight passengers. The detailed process can be found in the section "Disturbances Caused by Bombing of French Concession Trams" on this page.

### Disturbance Caused by Bomb Thrown at Tram in French Concession: Eight Passengers, Male and Female, Injured; Three Suspects Arrested on the Spot

Yesterday at 10:59 AM, a tram, No. 17 on Route 2 operated by a French company, was traveling eastward and stopped at the Xufui (Avenue Dubail) and Rue du Père Robert intersection. At that moment, Tram No. 4 on Route 7 was approaching from behind. Unexpectedly, several men on the platform suddenly threw paper boxes into the tram. These paper boxes contained sulfur bombs. When thrown into the tram, they exploded with a loud bang, immediately filling the area with thick smoke and intense flames, causing great chaos.

Passengers Flee for Their Lives; Traffic Halts

The passengers inside the tram were greatly alarmed by this sudden incident. The young and strong jumped out of the tram windows to escape, and many fell onto the platform. Women and children were pushed and trampled, their screams shaking the sky. Traffic was completely halted as a result. The traffic police informed the police station and the fire department. The police station dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. Soon, the fire department arrived to put out the flames.

Shrapnel Scatters, Eight Injured

At the time of the incident, most of the passengers sustained minor injuries and went to seek treatment on their own. Those with more serious injuries were later identified as: (1) Yan Wu (60 years old, from Suzhou, residing in Xifahua Town); (2) Wang Shiqiao (21 years old, local, residing at No. 65, Tongkang Lane, Mintiniyin Road); (3) Qian Wu (36 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 1475, Rue Lafayette); (4) Qian Wu's daughter, Qian Qilan (17 years old); (5) Li Shisong (34 years old, local, residing in Baxianqiao); (6) Yang Jinmei (28 years old, local, residing at No. 346, Wenlin Road); (7) Luo Xiangcha (34 years old, from Shangyu, residing at No. 49, Rue Hoche); and (8) Yi Shiping (20 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 1, Lane 690, Route Tenant de la Tour). All eight were injured in the legs by shrapnel. Except for Qian Qilan and Wang Shiqiao, who were seriously injured and hospitalized, the rest were bandaged by doctors and discharged.

Three Arrested for Investigation

After the incident, the police placed the area under guard and arrested three suspects, taking them back to the police station for investigation. Shrapnel and other debris from the tram were also collected for examination. It is reported that the sulfur bombs were homemade, using glass bottles shaped like wine bottles and filled with highly explosive sulfur and other materials, making them very easy to explode. It was also heard that many male and female passengers had their clothes burned. The police station is currently investigating the case.

Announcement by French Police Department

The French Concession Police Department issued a public announcement yesterday stating: "At noon today (the 27th), a passenger on a French tram traveling at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Rue du Père Robert placed a glass bottle filled with phosphorus inside a third-class carriage. Flames erupted instantly. The incident was spotted by other passengers. A struggle ensued. Fortunately, police intervened, preventing further harm. The passenger was originally a driver for the French Tram Company but was participating in the strike. He confessed at the police station that he obtained the bottle filled with phosphorus this morning in Huxi and intended to use it to burn trams that were in service. At the same time, a similar burning object was found in the tram behind, which firefighters fortunately extinguished, preventing a major disaster. However, eight Chinese were injured. To strengthen security, the French Police Department has increased the number of police officers stationed at all tram stops."

Security Strengthened

Following the burning bomb incident on Rue du Père Robert yesterday, which injured eight passengers, both the Public Works Department and the Police Department of the Municipal Council believe that these unfortunate incidents are occurring daily and have a major impact on passenger safety and security within the concession. Therefore, security was further strengthened on all routes yesterday. More patrolmen were stationed at factories and warehouses to provide protection, and armored cars patrolled the roads incessantly. Security was particularly comprehensive in the Rue du Père Robert area, and protection at tram stops was more stringent than elsewhere. Since the strike, only a few trams have been operating, making them ten times more crowded than before, so negligence is not an option.

### Laborers and Night Soil Collectors Also Strike Yesterday

Public Works Department Laborers

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department employs about 1,500 laborers. These workers are usually tasked with road construction and maintenance. However, yesterday around 8:00 AM, as the laborers were working, agitators appeared in the Xiaoshadu Road area and forced them to strike, causing about 600 Public Works Department laborers to stop working. Fortunately, the strike did not spread by the afternoon. It is rumored that the workers have demanded higher wages and other conditions. The Public Works Department has reportedly agreed to increase wages by three cents per person, but the workers felt it was too little, and it is said that the two sides will negotiate again. However, a reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired with the concession authorities at 4:00 PM yesterday and learned that the striking Public Works Department laborers had not yet made any demands or engaged in any negotiations as of yesterday afternoon.

Night Soil and Street Cleaners

Furthermore, a small number of garbage truck drivers and night soil collectors in the western district of the Public Concession also went on strike yesterday. Garbage and night soil littered the streets of Binlang Road, Gordon Road, Mackenzie Road, and along the Suzhou Creek, creating a foul odor and causing pedestrians to hesitate. Near the Mackenzie Road cleaning station, dozens of night soil carts were overturned on the road, garbage was scattered everywhere, and several vehicles were damaged. After receiving the report, the police dispatched a large number of patrolmen to the scene to suppress the unrest, but the agitators had already fled. Fire trucks were then called in to wash away the night soil with water. Inquiries with the Public Concession authorities revealed that only a very small number of street cleaners and night soil cart drivers were on strike.

Important News Roundup

Solid Tires Banned The French Concession Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that from December 1, 1940, new rickshaws not equipped with pneumatic tires will not be allowed to register. This announcement was made by the Chief Administrator, Tan Gute.

Donations for Ningbo Disaster Ningbo has recently been bombed repeatedly, causing great anxiety among Ningbo organizations in Shanghai. In recent days, they have been carrying donations to the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai to be remitted for disaster relief in Ningbo. Mr. Zhu Boquan, a Ningbo native in Shanghai, raised 20,000 yuan for disaster relief, which is commendable. In addition to remitting the funds to Ningbo for proper distribution, the association will remit more funds for disaster relief as donations from Ningbo natives in Shanghai accumulate.

Leprosy Lecture The China Leprosy Relief Association has invited Pastor Lomick of the Tengxian Leprosy Hospital in Shandong to broadcast a lecture on leprosy problems ("Leprosy in Shandong") on the Gospel Radio Station tonight from 7:00 to 7:30 PM on frequency 760.

Parcel Notice The acceptance and mailing of parcels to Chahe Town, Renhe Town, Licheng Town, Matou Town, Chenjiaji, Shunheji, Gaoliangjian and other places in the Jiangsu area are temporarily suspended.

Number of Refugees According to a report from the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 26th of this month, there are currently 14 shelters housing a total of 16,443 refugees.

### Authorities Provide Sound Protection: Water and Electricity Supplied Continuously: Workers at French Concession Water Plant All Reside at the Plant; Public Concession Has Made Various Preparations

Following the strike wave involving public transport vehicles in the two concessions of this city, rumors about the two important public utilities of water and electricity in the two concessions have become rampant, creating an atmosphere of heightened concern. In reality, the water and electricity workers in the two concessions deeply understand the overall situation and are not willing to be used by others. Therefore, they continue to work as usual. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency yesterday, both water companies in the two concessions have taken precautionary measures to ensure that the water supply within the concession will not be interrupted. The details obtained are as follows:

Military Protection

The French Concession Water Plant is located at the end of Rue Luber (Luban Road) in Lujiazhen. The plant's water source is drawn from the Huangpu River near Gaochangmiao in the south. However, since the outbreak of the war, the plant has also built several large artesian wells that can also serve as water sources. Due to the widespread rumors, the French authorities dispatched more than 20 armed soldiers to guard the plant's perimeter yesterday morning to provide security. It is also understood that the plant's workers have begun residing at the plant and will not be leaving for the time being. Furthermore, the plant's machinery is powered by diesel engines, requiring only a small number of people to manage.

Comprehensive Preparation

As for the water supply in the Public Concession, it is operated by the Shanghai Waterworks Company. According to representatives of the concession authorities and the company, even if a labor strike occurs in the Public Concession, the concession authorities and the company have reached a common agreement to maintain the water supply and ensure that it will not be interrupted. Therefore, residents within the concession should not easily believe rumors, and even if any outside attempts are made, the water supply will definitely not be interrupted.

### Rice Prices Rise Again: Authorities Closely Monitor: Large Amount of Foreign Rice from Hong Kong to be Shipped to Shanghai: Price Assessment Committee Ordered to Continue Performing its Duties

The rice market situation in Shanghai involves speculation and manipulation, disrupting the market and raising prices. Daily spot prices have continued to increase. Yesterday (27th), the market became even more tense due to the temporary suspension of the Shanghai defense shipping route. Foreign rice prices rose again. However, it is heard that a large amount of foreign rice from Hong Kong will be shipped to Shanghai to provide relief. Rice merchants are currently negotiating purchases and transportation.

Continuing Assessment

The Rice Price Assessment Committee previously believed that it was incapable of handling the chaotic situation in the rice market and requested guidance from the two concession authorities. For more than half a month, the committee seemed unable to proceed with its work and temporarily suspended operations. It is understood that the concession authorities separately replied to the committee yesterday, instructing it to continue performing its duties, assess market rice prices, and promising to provide effective assistance in cracking down on hoarding and price manipulation.

Agreement Reached

According to sources, the two concession authorities considered the matter serious after receiving the committee's request and held several consultations. They also appointed personnel to inquire with rice industry leaders about the actual situation of rice arrivals, sales, and stocks both domestically and internationally. It is said that concrete measures have been agreed upon and will be implemented. The two authorities are paying close attention to the entire rice market in Shanghai. Therefore, they delayed their response to the committee's request until now.

Market Rose Again Yesterday

After the rice merchants' tea party market opened at 7:30 AM yesterday, people's expectations immediately shifted upward, and market prices were generally expected to rise. General speculative rice traders spared no effort in raising prices. Crowds gathered, acting like rats scurrying around. Except for foreign rice, it seemed impossible to buy domestic rice on the market. The initial price of foreign rice was only slightly higher than the previous market. Around noon, retail traders amplified the trend, resulting in new high prices for foreign rice spot prices. No. 1 Saigon rice was priced as high as 70 yuan. However, it should be noted that the above rice prices are for genuine foreign rice, while most of the rice sold on the market is adulterated, so prices will naturally be different. Buyers should pay attention to distinguishing between the two.

### Foreign Employee of Public Bus Company, Favacho, Narrowly Escapes Harm: Abducted and Detained in a Small Hut by Armed Men: Released After Intervention by a Machinist: Aisen, Who Disappeared, Released and Returned to Residence Yesterday

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Bobby Favacho, an employee of the British-owned Public Bus Company and a well-known local sports figure, was abducted on the night of the 25th of this month outside the company's Connaught Road garage by ten armed Chinese men he did not know. After being imprisoned for three and a half hours,

he was released.

Security has now been stepped up at the Connaught Road garage to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Mr. Favacho was on his way home on the night of the 25th when he was taken to a small hut outside the Public Concession by ten armed men and imprisoned for three and a half hours. Fortunately,

a Chinese machinist

from the British-owned Public Bus Company, who was also thought to have participated in the strike, intervened and secured Mr. Favacho's release. Mr. Favacho has been with the British-owned Public Bus Company since its inception twelve years ago and is familiar with most of the Chinese workers. However, he did not recognize any of the ten men who abducted him. It is believed that the armed men intended to kill Mr. Favacho, but he was spared thanks to the machinist's mediation.

Aisen Sent Home

It has been learned that Aisen, the Russian executive of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company who was reported missing, was abducted and imprisoned by armed Chinese for a day and night and was released to his residence on Rue Petain (today's Hengshan Road) at six o'clock yesterday morning. The news was released by the Public Concession Police. High-ranking officials from the police declined to say what was the motivation behind the abduction or to describe the circumstances of it, but a friend of Aisen's claimed that Aisen had visible injuries on his face. The police then stated that the armed Chinese who kidnapped Aisen were not striking workers, but members of a criminal gang or organization. It is generally believed that Aisen was abducted because he refused to join the strike, but this has yet to be confirmed as of yesterday.

### French Consulate General Approves Increase in Tax for Inspection of Weights and Measures

### Japanese Warship Shells Xiepu Twice

A Japanese warship shelled Xiepu, north of Yinhai, again at 5:30 AM yesterday. It fired 58 shells in two rounds. The sound of the shelling was loud and continuous, ceasing only around noon. The Japanese warship remained in the waters for a long time before leaving. After the incident, an investigation into the damage revealed that while the residents along the coast of Xiepu were awakened from their dreams, they were able to escape in time, so there were no casualties. However, many houses along the coast were destroyed, and three civilian boats were sunk. The crew members fell into the water and drowned. After the Japanese warship left, a Japanese warplane was spotted over Shipu at 1:40 PM, observing at sea, seemingly searching for shipping routes. It then flew to Qiancang in Xiangshan Port and subsequently circled and scouted Chuanshan before heading out to sea.

### Suspension of Shanghai-Vietnam Route is Temporary: Cautious Steps Taken to Avoid Accidents: French Ships Sailing to Hong Kong Still Enter and Exit Normally

Due to the sudden change in the situation in Vietnam and the refusal of the French Vietnamese authorities to allow ships from the Allied nations, including Great Britain, to enter its ports, the British naval authorities in China have ordered British merchant ships to

temporarily suspend sailing to Vietnam

in order to avoid accidents, pending clarification of the situation. British ships that were already en route to Haiphong have been recalled. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, this move is a cautious step to observe the subsequent developments in Vietnam before

deciding whether to resume sailing.

The Hong Kong-Vietnam and Shanghai-Vietnam routes are temporarily suspended to protect interests, but this is only a short-term measure, similar to the previous situation. According to inquiries made by a Xinhua News Agency reporter with the person in charge of the British shipping company,

interests of both countries

the French ships sailing to and from Hong Kong waters are still entering and exiting normally, unhindered. The suspension of service is not related to the relationship between Britain and France. The authorities took this measure solely to ensure the safety of navigation and avoid unfortunate losses. The company is currently monitoring the evolution of the situation in Shanghai and Vietnam and awaiting instructions from its headquarters in Hong Kong before making further arrangements. For now, all ships bound for Haiphong are being diverted to Hong Kong as their final destination.

Postal Service Rerouted

Following the sudden change in the situation in Vietnam, the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping route has been temporarily suspended, and ships from Shanghai are only sailing as far as Hong Kong. This has created difficulties for postal services to the southwest provinces and cities. It is understood that (1) Imperial Airways of Great Britain suspended flights between Hong Kong and Vietnam on the 20th of this month. However, at that time, the airline was still accepting airmail to Hanoi, Bangkok, and other places. As the situation in Vietnam has become increasingly tense, it is now impossible to send airmail from Shanghai to the above two places, and acceptance of airmail has been temporarily suspended. (2) According to regulations, ordinary letters, express letters, registered mail, and other lightweight mail from Shanghai to the southwest provinces and cities are forwarded via Haiphong and Hong Kong. However, since the suspension of the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping route, it seems that all mail to the southwest provinces and cities can no longer be forwarded through the above two locations. According to news from the Transportation Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday, this mail is being rerouted via Xiamen in Fuzhou and Shipu in eastern Zhejiang, so there is no risk of interruption.

### German Ship "Hai Yi" Released and Arrives in Shanghai: Coal Nearly Depleted, Replenished Before Entering Port

The German ship "Hai Yi," which sails between Shanghai and Xiushan, was detained by a Japanese warship on its return voyage from Shanghai to Xiushan last week, and the ship was inspected. The ship's whereabouts were unknown for a time. It has now been learned that the ship was released on the 23rd of this month and returned to Shanghai on the 24th. During the days it was detained, the ship's food and fuel were nearly exhausted. After the German shipowner telegraphed the company authorities to repeatedly negotiate with the Japanese side, it was finally released. After arriving outside Wusong Port, it could not sail in due to lack of fuel and anchored outside the port. Later, passengers were transported to port by barges from the Huangpu River. Goods have been unloaded ashore over the past two days. The ship is currently moored at the Dongjiadu pontoon.

### New French Consul General Arrives in Shanghai: Consul General Eugène and Others Leave Shanghai; New Post is Médélaira

After the French Consul General in Shanghai, Baudézés, and his successor, Eugène, left Shanghai one after the other, the affairs of the consulate were temporarily handled by Duval from the consulate. It has now been learned that the French government has officially appointed Médélaira as Consul General in Shanghai, and he has already set out for Shanghai. Mr. Médélaira previously served as First Secretary at the French Embassy in the United Kingdom.

### Truth Behind the Baokang Lane Murder Case: Unfilial Son Instigates Father's Murder: Two Accomplices and the Unfilial Son Arrested: Detained for Investigation, Further Investigation of Mastermind, Fugitive Sought

Wu Gaoyou, a 52-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 59 Baokang Lane, Lane 315, Rue Dufour (Xiafei Road), was a second landlord who earned a small fortune from the paper business. He was addicted to smoking opium and lived upstairs, renting out the remaining rooms. His son, Wu Guoliang, 25, was in the medicinal herb business. The father and son lived together. At 10 PM on the night of August 15 of this year, Wu's family and neighbors were enjoying the cool air outside the gate and on the sun deck because of the hot weather. Wu was alone in his room,

lying on a couch, inhaling clouds and exhaling smoke. Suddenly, a murderer broke in through the back door and went upstairs, took out a kitchen knife, and hacked Wu's head and face dozens of times, severing two-thirds of his neck, killing him instantly. The murderer fled immediately. By the time the family discovered what had happened, the criminal had already escaped. They reported it to the French police, who sent a hearse to the verification office. The Second Special Court sent personnel to verify the cause of death. The son, Wu Guoliang, signed a guarantee to receive the body for burial. After the case occurred, the police ordered detectives to arrest the murderer. At the time, it was generally speculated that it was a revenge killing, but Wu had no enemies in his lifetime, so it was difficult to determine

the truth behind the murder. It is now learned that this case is the second case of patricide after the Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinzhang brothers' patricide case on Route Haig (today's Huashan Road). The French police have determined that the murder was masterminded by the deceased's son, Wu Guoliang, in collusion with his cousin (the deceased's nephew), who paid 600 yuan to hire a murderer to kill his father. Detectives were dispatched to arrest the mastermind, Wu Guoliang, and two accomplices surnamed Pan. However, the main murderer, a certain Jia, had already fled inland after hearing the news and is currently being pursued. Yesterday afternoon, the police sent the arrested Wu and Pan to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Prosecutors Sun and Peng questioned them. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated that the defendants were involved in a

filial son kills father

case, and because the police station still needed to investigate and track down the fugitive, he requested that the defendants be detained temporarily until the facts of the case were clarified and a request for interrogation was made. The court approved the request after briefly questioning the defendants and ordered a two-week adjournment for further investigation. The defendants were remanded in custody. It is also rumored that the case stemmed from a monetary dispute.

### Wife Abused by Husband with Mental Illness: Xie Shao Accuses Her Father-in-Law of Assault

Xie Shao, a 28-year-old woman from Ningbo residing at No. 30 Yuyang Lane, Rue Baille, French Concession, married Xie Qingtang, son of Xie Qirui (59 years old, also from Ningbo, residing at No. 35 Yuyang Lane on the same street), a former jewelry broker, in September of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932). They have had two children each, son and daughter. Recently, her husband, Qingtang, suffered from mental illness and often beat her. Unexpectedly, her father-in-law even

helped a tyrant to do evil

and assisted his son in abusing her. On the 8th of this month, Xie Qirui once again had a dispute with the wet nurse, and Xie again took his anger out on her, beating her throat, causing injuries to her chest and legs. Xie Shao, unwilling to accept this, hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to represent her and submitted a petition to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court requesting a medical examination and a statement to the Criminal Division accusing her father-in-law, Xie Qirui, of assault and requesting that he be investigated in accordance with Article 277 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the statement, and Judge Zhu Chuzhe opened the trial yesterday morning. The plaintiff and her lawyer were present in court,

recounted the past circumstances.

The defendant and his defense lawyer, Wang Zhonghuan, were present in court and denied the assault, stating that the plaintiff had provoked him and torn his clothes. The court verified the statements and advised the defendant, "Your son has a mental illness. As the wife of a husband with an illness, she is naturally affected by the stimulus. As the head of the family, you should take care and not allow family disputes to occur again. You should quickly seek a reconciliation." The case was adjourned to October 2 for further hearing.

### Japanese Merchant Ship "San Yu Maru" Collides with Ferry: One Chinese Man Tragically Drowns

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the No. 17 Huangpu Ferry, operated by Jardine Matheson, was carrying two passengers and collided with the Japanese Mitsui & Co.'s "San Yu Maru" (transliteration) in the Huangpu River near Zhoujiazui, Pudong, yesterday (26th).

### Observatory Report: Hurricane Season Ends

According to a report released by the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday morning, the hurricane season for this year has ended as of this week. This is because the current climate no longer has the potential to trigger hurricanes. However, the weather in Shanghai and north of the Yangtze River is very cool and slightly rainy, which is not a sign of hurricanes but rather a result of a cold wave. The weather is expected to clear up in one or two days.

### Abandoning a Corpse: Two Perpetrators Sentenced to Imprisonment

Lu Chen, who ran a brothel in room 222 of the Ji Sheng Inn at No. 195, Fujian Road, had an eight-year-old girl under her care, Lu Yuxian, who died of illness on the 8th. Instead of buying a coffin and preparing the body, Lu Chen colluded with Shi Wenxue, a tea server at the inn, and Lu Miaosheng, a gatekeeper, to abandon the corpse. The police station discovered the incident afterward and arrested Shi, Lu Chen, and inn employees Gu Hongsheng, Yan Gengquan, Gu Youjin, Song Wenxiang, Xu Pinjun, and prostitutes Lu Zhaodi and Wang Xiaofeng. They also arrested Tong Shichang, the owner of Changming Electrical Appliances in Fuzhou Road, suspected of taking advantage of the situation to commit fraud. All were handed over to the Special First Court and detained for a later hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie Fen continued the trial at the criminal court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, prosecuted Shi Wenxue, Lu Miaosheng, and Lu Chen for abandoning a corpse. The remaining defendants were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence to prove their guilt. After the trial, Shi Wenxue and Lu Chen were each sentenced to six months in prison, Lu Miaosheng was found not guilty, and the remaining defendants were released.

### Sudden Death of Yuan Qishan: Awaiting Claim by Relatives

Yuan Qishan, a native of Henan, was approximately 50 years old, in good health, and stout. He previously worked as a house caretaker at the Sanbei Company. After the war, the company ceased operations, and Yuan left his job and lived alone in the stove room of Ni Zhenhua's house at No. 195, Wenlin Road. He left early and returned late, without any family. On the 26th, the servants of the Ni family, not having seen Yuan for two days, knocked on his door at 11 PM on the 20th. When there was no response, Ni's maid, Ji Xiuzhen, looked through the glass window into Yuan's room and saw him lying motionless on the bed. They managed to open the door and enter, only to find that Yuan had already died. They immediately reported to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to investigate. The cause of death was determined to be a stroke. Since he had no family, the body was sent to the Tongren Funyuan branch morgue. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the Special Second Court for officials to inspect and confirm the identity of the body, and the Shantang charity was requested to prepare the body for burial, awaiting claim by relatives. It was also reported that the deceased's belongings were inspected by the police and temporarily entrusted to the second landlord for safekeeping, pending delivery to the court for claim by relatives.

### Worker Beats Man to Death

Qian Daidong, a native of Jiangbei who worked as an oiler at the Xinyu Cotton Mill at No. 8, Robison Road, had a violent temper. At around 2 AM the previous morning, he had a quarrel and fight with his fellow townsman, Zhang Jinsheng, over a trivial matter in the spinning room. Zhang was seriously injured in a vital area and fell to the ground, crying for help. He was then taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment, where his condition was critical. Wang Conghao, the Chinese detective in charge from the Putuo Road police station, rushed to the scene and arrested Qian. Yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, described the circumstances and stated that the victim had reportedly died in the hospital, requesting a postponement. When questioned, Qian's statements were evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation.

### Father Accuses Son of Embezzlement

Jiang Deyu, a native of Jiangbei, made a living by buying and selling chicken and duck eggs and opened the Jiang Dexing Egg Shop at No. 5, Lane 39, Qinghai Road.

Recently, Jiang Deyu discovered that his son had embezzled funds totaling 452.60 yuan in installments from August 11th to September 20th. He confronted his son, leading to an argument. The police were called and took them both to the Chengdu Road police station. After investigation by Detective Ni Runsheng, Jiang Deyu insisted on pressing charges, so Jiang Zhiping was detained.

### Japanese Plainclothes Officers Arrest People in Both Concessions: Guest at Yong'an Hotel Arrested and Escapes

According to reports, yesterday afternoon at around 3 PM, several Japanese plainclothes officers, accompanied by personnel dispatched by the Public Concession Police Department, rushed to the Yong'an Hotel at No. 8, Lane 127, Fujian Road, intending to arrest a guest named Yuan in room 12. Yuan was in his room at the time and was arrested and taken to the hotel lobby. While searching his room, Yuan unexpectedly managed to unlock his handcuffs while the police officers were not paying attention and escaped without a trace. When the Japanese plainclothes officers went outside, they discovered that Yuan had fled and arrested a tea server in the lobby on suspicion of being a lookout. They then attempted to arrest the head clerk, but he had also fled. It is reported that Yuan specialized in forging passes and was arrested by the Japanese after being discovered.

### Singapore's忧悒 (Melancholy)

— Shi Tao

The steel statue of Stamford Raffles, the builder of Singapore, stands at the southernmost tip of Asia in the center of the dusk. In the past, a layer of brilliant glory shone on his silhouette, but today, in the same silhouette, we can only find an expression worried about the war in the motherland.

When the street lights were already shining brightly on the dim streets, under the coconut trees in the park facing the coast, listening to the breeze brought by the waves, the Malay driver leaned against the carriage and played his beloved accordion, and the sorrowful song followed:

"The glorious sun

The boundless blue coast

The coconut trees are so refreshing

Swaying in the air

Everything is so happy

But

The Malay carriage shop has not a trace of hope"

That weak melody evoked the tears of the passing Malays and the old dreams of the Malays in the past.

Since the outbreak of the European War last autumn, the peaceful scenery of Singapore has gradually changed its appearance. Look, there are more soldiers patrolling the streets, and every part of the island is about to be militarized. On the banks of the Singapore River, young volunteer soldiers carry rifles and are busy training. Most of the shops on Raffles Square, the commercial center, have been forcibly evacuated under the name of coastal defense.

On the other hand, strict blackouts and air raid drills are also implemented from time to time, but because Singapore's residents are racially complex, the municipal authorities have encountered difficulties with language mixing. Since ancient times, Singapore has always been an exhibition place for races. Walking on the streets or squares, you can see Indians with black beards and headscarves, Siamese people who have the habit of applying cow dung to their foreheads, overseas Chinese who dominate the Nanyang area, Malays, Filipinos... Twenty-six countries' languages ​​are commonly used here.

In the event that Singapore is visited by the god of war, the municipal authorities must distribute gas masks, so it must be publicized in the national languages ​​of 26 countries. But the difficulty is that the blackout in Malay means the opposite of deregulation in Arabic. Phenomena like this are too numerous to mention. Therefore, the municipal authorities are now starting to train various ethnic groups in standard Malay; recently, the propaganda has been too effective, and the foolish Indians and others have also felt the threat of airplanes, and on the dark night of the air raid drill, they lit a fire and knelt in front of the god Allah to pray.

Singapore is so permeated with the fog of war that the Seletar Fortress cannot be ignored. In the past, Seletar was just a fishing village in the Johor Strait, but today, it has become a British air force base. Not far from Seletar, there is also a famous naval base, where olive trees and coconut trees crisscross. The tropical vines hang luxuriantly on these branches, disguising this military fortress as an ancient jungle. The surroundings are covered with electrified barbed wire, and Indian police or Malay soldiers guard every place. Several 15-inch caliber cannons are laid on the hills, and gasoline is buried in the dense forest, said to be 3 million tons. If so, it is enough for the British fleet to concentrate in Singapore for a year.

Rear Admiral Demans, a British naval expert in the Far East, once said: "When the East loses Singapore, it will be when the sun sets in Britain." The current situation is really urgent every moment. Britain has recorded 600 million pounds of fortress construction costs in Singapore, building huge docks and installing long-range cannons... She should not easily let this Far East base go!

Here, Singapore has re-entered a paradise mixed with all kinds of races, and is gradually suffering from her憂悒 (melancholy) again.

### Review of Drugs

— Su Fu

Reading Magazine Digest

In the January 1939 issue, I saw that three small countries in Europe uniformly prohibited the publication of advertisements for drugs, and seeing the recent Shanghai newspaper red with advertisements for medicines and tonics, I couldn't help but feel deeply. I feel that the Chinese people do not pay enough attention to health, and sometimes even treat life as a child's play. This kind of wrong psychology must be corrected as soon as possible.

The methods adopted by the governments of these three small countries are as follows:

Denmark: Since 1932, the law has stipulated a strict ban on the publication of various drug advertisements in newspapers and magazines. However, drug advertisements are allowed to be published in publications published by physicians, surgeons, dentists, chemists, etc. (because the government believes that physicians and others have specialized knowledge, and advertisements published after being recognized by physicians and others will not harm the people.)

Norway: Since 1930, there have been laws clearly stipulating that it is strictly forbidden to advertise medicines and tonics at will, and medicines may not be sold unless they have been tested by the National Medical Association (Medieal Board) and the Ministry of Health (Ministry of Health). Therefore, all newspapers and magazines refuse to publish drug advertisements unless the drug has been tested and approved for distribution by the National Medical Association, and the advertisement has also been approved by the National Medical Association.

In Norway, after the medicine is made, it must be submitted to the National Medical Association for testing. If it is approved, it can be sold, and the price must also be reviewed by the association. If the association considers it too high, it can also reduce it. If the drug merchant is preparing to publish an advertisement, he must submit the draft of the advertisement together with a request for review by the association. If the association believes that the words in the advertisement are exaggerated, it can cut and change the wording.

Sweden: The law has clear provisions that medicines containing toxic substances may not be sold unless the prescription is written by a physician.

The sale of all drugs must be inspected and approved by the Ministry of Health.

From the above, the governments of these three countries pay great attention to the manufacture and sale of drugs, and the inspection and review are very careful, because this is a matter of the health of the people of the country. The Danish government also respects physicians very much. As long as the medicine is recognized by the physician, it can be advertised in the publications published by the physician. This is their respect for the physician's personality.

China has not yet seen many medical publications, so it may not be possible to ban drug advertisements in ordinary publications for a while. However, for the sake of national health, it seems that the government and local authorities should strictly review the drugs sold in the market.

Chapter 8: Two People Caught

Hawthorne continued: "Mr. Zhao, can you be frank and explain what you have been through automatically? Or do you have to go to another location before you are willing to speak?"

Yue Boxiong still did not speak, but shifted his cold gaze to me.

Hawthorne removed his false beard and dark glasses, put them in his pocket, and said, "I think you always know me. My surname is Huo, and my single name is Sangzi. This is Mr. Bao Lang, you must have heard of it. Let's meet each other with our real faces. Okay?"

Hawthorne raised his right hand, as if to remove the false beard on his lips. Zhao Boxiong suddenly raised his right hand automatically, first removed his glasses, and then lifted it on his lips, and the false beard immediately fell into his hand. He suddenly spoke automatically.

He made a cold, hoarse sound and said, "Are you private detectives? Isn't it?" Hawthorne bowed slightly, with a smile on his face, but did not answer, his eyes were looking at Zhao Boxiong's leather shoes.

He said again: "What reason do you have to control me with weapons? Infringe on my freedom?" He threw his glasses and other things on the table next to him.

Hawthorne still said with a smile: "I have already said it, it's because of those two bullets. One bullet you killed Wang Li..."

Before Zhao Boxiong could finish speaking, he suddenly let out a sneer, which was a hum from his nose. This smile and hum contained a cold taste. It seemed to have more power than an answer. It even made Hawthorne stunned.

Hawthorne said in surprise: "What, did I say something wrong?"

Zhao Boxiong showed a contemptuous look. He said to himself: "What a great detective with a unique eye..."

Just at this time, the door suddenly opened, and Ni Jin burst in. He was also holding a gun in his hand, and two burly detectives followed behind. I felt that my mission could come to an end, so I took back my gun.

Hawthorne nodded and said, "Detective Ni, I haven't had breakfast yet, and my five internal organs are about to riot. I'll leave this person to you... Bao Lang, although you have had porridge, your nerves have been tense for a long time, so you have to rest. Let's go."

He and I walked to the door, and he stopped again to speak to Ni Jinshou.

"Detective Ni, the pistol on the table is missing two bullets, so keep it safe." He was about to walk out again. Suddenly he stopped again. "He may have a second gun on him, so you have to be careful." After he finished speaking, he was the first to walk out the door.

When I went out with him, I also looked back. Ni Jinshou was still aiming the gun at Zhao Boxiong, and two detectives had already stood on Zhao Boxiong's left and right sides, one was starting to search, and the other had already taken out a shiny copper touch and was about to put it on Zhao Boxiong's wrist. Zhao Boxiong did not have any tendency to resist. (120)

### Struggle

— Liu Jiajin

Struggle is not a "noun" in the mouths of empty talkers, but those who work hard do not have meaningless fantasies, and he never makes beautiful dreams; but takes all his time and energy to deal with the difficult reality.

The more setbacks, the more courageous the struggle, but the closer to the road to success.

Struggle requires capital: a calm mind, a healthy body, a firm will, and a fiery passion.

### Music and Healing

— Yong

What is the relationship between music and healing? Readers will inevitably have this question after seeing the topic. Indeed, in the past, no matter who in the medical field, everyone unanimously admitted that music can only be used as a thing to cultivate sentiment and adjust the spirit. However, today, some people have discovered that music itself has the function of healing, and they have also cited several existing facts to prove it.

In Pennsylvania, USA, there was a woman who suffered from paralysis and could not move her feet, but after listening to four radio music programs, she was able to restore her original function. There was also a soldier who participated in the First World War and became a mute because he was shocked by the explosion of shells on the front line; later, after listening to someone singing a famous Italian song, he was able to sing inadvertently. A sanatorium for lung diseases also reported by a doctor that the pulse and temperature of the patients in the hospital often show improvement after they have listened to noble music. The person who cited these things is a senior in the American music industry—Mrs. Harriet Seymour (Mrs. Harriet Seymour), who is also the first person to discover that music can directly heal diseases. She organized a committee in New York called the Charity Relief Music Healing Committee. Last year, initiated by the association, 975 music performances were held in 37 hospitals, and as a result, 44,006 patients were affected differently.

Once, Mrs. Seymour said to the press: "According to my many years of experience, I know that certain diseases can indeed be treated with certain music. Stephen Foster's music and Hungarian and Spanish dance music can treat mental illness or nervous disorders. Sousa's marches and folk songs from various countries can treat paralysis. The ensemble of brass bands, if not too tense, can give comfort to those suffering from heart disease. Classical music has the effect of helping to eliminate the pain of patients. Others such as Mendelssohn's "Spring Song" can make people with insomnia fall asleep sweetly after playing it several times in a row; waltzes are very beneficial for those suffering from tuberculosis."

The connection between music and healing should be good news for patients; and on the other hand, it really shines a new light on the music world!

### Talks on Opera Tunes

— Su Shaoqing

On the Saying That an Actor's Name Determines Their Fate (1)

Three years ago, I traveled to Japan and saw in its major cities practitioners of nameology predicting people's fortunes based on their names. Inquirers would write their names, and the practitioner would predict their fate based on it. Our country originally had methods of fortune-telling by dissecting and piecing together characters, and their technique is roughly similar. However, these practitioners dissect the characters, discussing the four tones and whether they are yin or yang. It is a pity that at the time, the language barrier prevented me from paying attention. Having researched opera for a long time, I have labored over the study of phonetics, and I unintentionally discovered a strange thing, namely that the sound of an actor's name is related to their fate. Looking at the past and examining the present, it has been consistently accurate. I will now briefly describe the general idea to provide amusement for enthusiasts. Believe it or not, it is up to you.

The tones of Chinese characters, especially the yin and yang of the level tone, are incredibly profound. Not only in lyrics, poetry, opera texts, and ballads is the harmony of hard and soft sounds entirely dependent on the arrangement of the yin and yang of the level tone, but even in an actor's name, observing the quantity of the level tone and the combination of yin and yang can determine their entire life's success, failure, honor, and disgrace. Is this not mysterious? According to my research, for actors with good fortune, among the three characters of their stage name: it is good to have many level tones; it is even better to have many yang level tones; it is good for the surname to occupy a yang level tone; it is even better for the last character to occupy a yang level tone. Based on these four points, here are some examples:

For old male roles, Cheng Changgeng has three level tones, two of which are yang. His reputation and career have been brilliantly recorded for thousands of years. Among his most famous disciples, Wang Guifen and Sun Juxian each occupy two level tones, all yin, with the middle character being oblique. Their artistry was unparalleled, but their fates were unfortunate. Wang died early, and Sun suffered in his old age. Looking back at Lao Tan, Tan Xinpei's three characters uniquely occupy three level tones, categorized as two yang and one yin, with yang at both ends, great talent was achieved, and he enjoyed his later years alone. People admired him as Mount Tai and the Big Dipper. Although his fifth son, Xiao Pei, is considered to have a slender build, his grandson Sun Ziying today almost dominates the male role. His great-grandson Sui will also be a talented person in the future. Is this not because of the good name? When he was around forty years old, his stage name was Xiao Jiaotian (the three characters of Xiao Jiaotian only have one level tone, which is yin), and his voice was unremarkable, wandering in amateur troupes. When he changed his name to Tan Xinpei (the name change occurred in the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign when he entered the Qing palace as a court actor), he soared straight up, surpassing Wang and Sun, who had long been famous, and finally achieved royal status (in the second year of the Republic, he was given the title of King of the Acting World). Can it not be said that the change of name was helpful?
