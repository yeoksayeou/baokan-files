### British Navy Continues Victory: Landing in Narvik, Norway; Over Thirty German Warships and Transport Ships Lost; Pocket Battleship Admiral Hipper Also Sunk

London - The Admiralty has just issued a communique stating that our troops have landed in the port of Narvik, northern Norway. (Havas dispatch, 15th) London - The Army and Navy jointly issued a communique in the morning, stating that British troops have landed at several locations on the coast of Norway. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

London - Regarding the battle situation in Narvik, northern Norway, although official sources here still refuse to release information, it is generally believed that the port has been recaptured by British forces. Under the protection of the British fleet, it will simultaneously become a base for both land and sea battles. Moreover, the port is close to the iron ore region of northern Sweden. If occupied by British forces, the German plan to invade Sweden will inevitably be hindered. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

London - A telegram from the capital of Sweden states that the British and French fleets are performing very well in the naval battle off Narvik, Norway, and German forces in the port have already been driven out. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

London - A naval communique announced that further reports from our submarines indicate that two more German transport ships have been sunk. In addition, an attack was carried out on a group of German transport ships in the Skagerrak, with four torpedoes hitting their targets. The communique also stated that yesterday, the British naval air force again attacked enemy transport ships and aircraft in the Bergen area. One transport ship caught fire, a small supply ship sank, and a large survey ship was strafed with machine-gun fire by British planes, catching fire and burning. One British plane returned to base safely. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Stockholm - When the German 26,000-ton battleship Gneisenau was sunk, it had a crew of 1,500 officers and men. As of now, excluding the "Admiral Hipper," the loss of German warships accounts for approximately 27% of the country's total naval tonnage. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

London - According to the "Daily Express," several armed British ships have been carrying an expeditionary force, following behind British warships, heading towards Narvik since Saturday. News from knowledgeable sources indicates that the expeditionary force numbers around 100,000. According to reports from neutral countries, after the British naval victory on Saturday, British and French troops arrived at Narvik. However, German sources claim that the British and French fleets are still out at sea. Official sources here neither confirm nor criticize these two reports. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

London - Prime Minister Chamberlain will deliver a detailed statement to the House of Commons on April 16th regarding the British landing in Norway. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Stockholm - It has been reported from Berlin that the German ship sunk in the Oslofjord was one of Germany's most powerful warships, the Gneisenau, and not the cruiser Blücher. It has been definitively confirmed that Admiral Carls, commander of the German main battle fleet, and several high-ranking army and naval officers were forced to swim ashore after the ship sank, as these high-ranking officers only command the largest battleships. Berlin has not denied the Norwegian claim that the Gneisenau has already sunk. German authorities announced last week the loss of the 10,000-ton cruiser Blücher and the 6,000-ton cruiser Karlsruhe. It is reported that the Blücher was heavily damaged when it attempted to bombard Norwegian 11-inch caliber guns outside Oslo. The Blücher was only completed last year and was equipped with eight 8-inch guns and three aircraft. The Gneisenau, on the other hand, was one of the largest and most powerful ships in the German fleet. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

London - According to a communique issued by the British Admiralty, as a result of British naval operations in Norway last week, Germany has lost over thirty warships and transport ships in total. The German 10,000-ton pocket battleship Admiral Hipper, a sister ship to the Graf Spee, which scuttled itself in South American waters several months ago, was destroyed on Thursday morning by the British 670-ton submarine Swordfish. A German cruiser, presumably the 6,000-ton Karlsruhe, was torpedoed and sunk by the British ship Truant on Tuesday. The German side has now acknowledged the loss of this ship. In addition, on April 10th, two other unidentified German ships were also sunk. Furthermore, four other German ships under escort were also hit by torpedoes, but the results are unknown. The German ship Alster, 8,145 tons, has been captured by the British. Three large fishing boats have also been brought into British ports. On Wednesday, the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla sank six German supply ships and the munitions-laden Ravensfeld outside Narvik. The German oil tanker Skagerrak, 6,044 tons, scuttled itself upon seeing the approach of British warships, as there was no escape. The German ship Maine was spotted by the Norwegian destroyer Traug and also scuttled itself. Its crew of approximately 60 men was rescued by the Norwegian ship and brought to a British port. The Norwegian ship Traug has now joined the Allied navy. It is reported that the German oil tanker Kattegat has been scuttled in the Skagerrak Strait by the Norwegians. The losses of German submarines have not yet been determined. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### British Navy Smashes Goebbels' Slogans

Paris - News of the British Navy's resounding victories in Narvik has been met with jubilation throughout France. All Parisian newspapers have published this news on the front page in large characters. The general sentiment is, "If Nelson knew, he would be overjoyed in the afterlife." Official commentary suggests that "the British Navy has smashed all of Goebbels' slogans in a matter of hours." A semi-official statement elaborates on the strategic importance of British operations in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, stating that the German attempt to seize Norwegian ports has proven to be a major mistake. The Allies can now operate freely in the North Sea without hindrance. The British Navy has demonstrated that Hitler's habitual attacks are merely hollow threats when met with initial resistance.

### British Air Force Bombards Stavanger Airfield; German Plane Crashes in Sweden

London - The Air Ministry announced that British planes again flew low at dawn to attack the Stavanger airfield and hangars, damaging several enemy aircraft.

Stockholm - An official communique has just been released stating that a German plane flew over our town of Uddevalla (south of the Norwegian border) into our airspace. Local anti-aircraft batteries first fired a warning shot, but the German plane continued flying, so they opened fire and hit it, causing it to catch fire and crash. The pilot died on the spot. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Berlin - According to a local Berlin newspaper, German Air Attaché Captain Spierer was indeed killed in action in Oslo. (Haitong dispatch, 15th)

### German Troops Reinforce Trondheim; Railway Line East of Narvik Blown Up; 3,000 Norwegian Soldiers Retreat into Sweden and are Detained

Stockholm - The Norwegian government has just issued a communique stating that German troops have departed from Oslo to reinforce Trondheim. According to news from the Norwegian border, German troops, after occupying the city of Halden, also occupied the town of Krossjesier and took over the customs office there. Norwegian troops have now retreated to a location 20 kilometers from the Swedish border. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Stockholm - According to border news obtained by newspapers, Norwegian forces have blown up the railway line from Narvik to Luleå, cutting off the transport of German troops within Narvik. It is reported that German troops have occupied Sarpsborg, southeast of Oslo, which is located on the Glomma River. It is also reported that Halden, near the Swedish border, surrendered without a fight, and over a hundred German soldiers entered the city in trucks. German troops have retreated near Eidsvold, so Kongsvinger is temporarily safe. According to its reporters, the Norwegian front line is gradually taking concrete form due to the efforts of Norwegian officers returning from the Finnish front. German troops are very well equipped; when their first transport ships arrived in Oslo, light tanks and several heavy artillery pieces were unloaded. According to reports, German troops are now sweeping away resistance and advancing rapidly towards the Swedish border. Naval battles have been ongoing for a week on the west coast of Norway, while German troops on land are now crossing Lake Mjøsa from Oslo towards Charlottenberg. German heavy bombers continue to attack Elverum, killing over fifty people. After continuing to land in Oslo, German troops immediately set out east. Guerilla warfare is still taking place between Kongsvinger and Halden, not far from the Norwegian-Swedish border. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Paris - The German military authorities in the occupied areas of Norway have issued an order stating that any Norwegian who dares to answer the government's call to arms will be immediately executed upon capture. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Stockholm - Three hundred Norwegian soldiers, after fighting German troops southeast of Oslo, have crossed the border between Halden and Gothenburg into Swedish territory and have been detained by Swedish authorities. It is also known that fighting is still ongoing east of Kongsvinger, and the city is still in the hands of Norwegian troops. German planes have flown over Swedish airspace, and two have been shot down near the Swedish border by British and French planes. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Stockholm - Regarding the war in Norway, local newspapers recently reported that the German front has now expanded to the south of Aurskog, and Eidsvoll fell at 2:00 AM this morning. Norwegian troops stationed in Elverum have automatically withdrawn, crossing the Vorma River and defending the high ground. There is no confirmation on the current situation. Fierce fighting occurred near Ski near Gjøvik yesterday, but the number of German troops involved was very small. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Paris - Military sources here have recently stated that the course of the Norwegian war over the past 24 hours has been similar in nature to the previous day, namely, a type of "road war." German troops are attempting to advance along transportation lines from the Oslo area directly into the heart of Norway, allegedly to obstruct the country's mobilization plans and to establish contact with German troops landing in various locations on the west coast of Norway. On the Norwegian side, they have stepped up defenses at key locations, such as bridges, forests, passage entrances, and roads along lakes. At the same time, the Norwegian mobilization plan, under the command of the Norwegian General Staff, is proceeding exceptionally quickly. The country's air force and the remaining fleet have also begun to attack the enemy. This can be seen in yesterday's downing of several German planes by the Norwegian air force and the pursuit of the ship "Dahlak" to intercept German cargo ships on the west coast, forcing them to scuttle themselves. The British air force's three bombings of the Stavanger airfield are of even greater significance. After the third bombing, the German side can hardly make use of this airfield anymore. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Stockholm - According to local official sources, German troops in Norway have advanced to the Karnesjøs customs station near the Norwegian-Swedish border, south of Halden. The railway from Oslo to Trondheim also passes through this area. (Haitong dispatch, 15th)

London - According to news from the Swedish capital, the Norwegian General Headquarters has just announced that Swedish and Finnish volunteers have arrived at the front lines to participate in the war. In addition, the Norwegian Naval Headquarters announced that a total of three German planes were shot down today, and all the pilots have been captured. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Editorial

### The Development of the European Situation and Italy

European turmoil has moved in many directions throughout the world due to Germany's invasion of Scandinavia. Although the fierce war is limited to a corner of Northern Europe, and the goal is also limited to the Norwegian coast, these situations are by no means the essence or the full picture of the so-called second stage of the European war. It is only a preliminary stage. What the preliminary stage shows about the second stage is only that the scope of the war is expanding, and the status of neutral countries is becoming more difficult. They can no longer continue their previous ambiguity and are forced to clarify their position. If they do not join the German side, they must join the British and French side. Not only does the environment no longer allow them to hesitate, but time also does not allow them to waver. In short, Western European countries like the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg are in this situation, as are Balkan countries like Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece. Even Italy, the leader of Southern Europe, must be in this situation. It is easier for small countries to be invaded, and their reactions and displays of attitude are as quick as an echo. For example, Norway, although initially more tolerant of Germany and more serious towards Britain and France, quickly became an ally of Britain and France due to its resistance to Germany. As for neutral great powers, their strength is stronger, their position is more important, their past history and current environment are more complex, their political color is stronger, and their national aspirations are more ambitious. On the belligerent side, they naturally see neutral small countries as easier to deal with, but they must treat great powers differently due to various considerations. It is not easy to make them submit through threats, nor is it easy to satisfy them through temptations. In the seven months since the start of the European war, in addition to military action, the belligerent countries have engaged in intense struggles on all fronts of international politics, economics, and diplomacy, all under various pretenses, to try and win over the larger neutral countries. History does not repeat itself. We cannot portray the various events of the First World War and apply them to the present situation. Recalling those years, it was a major war from the beginning, not like this time's deeply entrenched trench warfare. Therefore, the strength of both belligerent sides can be said to have been completely undiminished after seven months of fighting. Both belligerent sides are engaged in war, treating each other with caution, not gambling with strength, but only gambling with time. Therefore, if we examine the battlefield, after seven months of stalemate, who is winning and who is losing is still a complete unknown. Italy's attitude is also different from the First World War. At the beginning of the war, it declared that it would not participate on either side, but at the same time, it made various gestures and expressions, showing its readiness to join the war at any time. This is a great mystery under the sky, and no one can determine the answer!

If these expressions and gestures are not false, it shows that Italy wants to stay out of it; but its wavering and ambiguity do not mean that it claims to be completely impartial. Since the beginning of the war, its rhetoric has been quite extraordinary, and its actions have not been weak. The fascist leader has repeatedly announced to his people to be ready for battle, and his diplomatic machinations in the Balkans show that he is adhering to his policies. Its rhetoric, its actions, and its policies are distinctly different from neutrality, and clearly show the world that it is leaning towards Germany, its Axis partner. The reason for this is not unexpected, because Italy's foreign policy actually has four cornerstones: First, Italy's alliance with Germany was never completely sound, but rather lopsided. Therefore, there was no obligation to help Germany in the war, but in order to deal with the international situation, Italy still believed that maintaining the status quo was more beneficial. Therefore, it maintained close ties with Germany while maintaining a "reserved" attitude towards the war. Second, Italy is waiting for the most favorable opportunity to arrive, in order to achieve its wishes in one fell swoop. In analyzing its wishes, some contradict Germany, while others require concessions from Britain and France. Third, German leader Hitler is well aware of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's wishes and attitude. Hitler is confident that Germany's victory over Britain and France does not depend on Italy's assistance, as long as Italy does not help Britain and France. Therefore, Germany expects less and hopes for more from Italy. Therefore, Italy does not plan to fight desperately, but is only preparing to shed the least amount of blood at the final moment of victory and achieve the greatest success. Fourth, although Italy's national strength is strong, it is inferior to Britain, France, and Germany. If it tries to catch up in peacetime, it is difficult to hope to catch up. However, when war breaks out, it is a period of mutual attrition for the belligerent countries, and a period of construction for Italy, which is also the best opportunity to bring its national strength on par. These four cornerstones have led Italy to adopt the attitude it has taken for the past seven months. However, the international situation and the evolution of the war have made Italy not want to remain a bystander for much longer.

If it does not remain a bystander, then what? Yesterday, a telegram from the Italian capital reported that Ansaldo, the manager of the "Telegraph News," the newspaper of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, suddenly delivered a radio address to the Italian army, saying:

"Italy is waiting for the most profitable opportunity to participate in the European war. He believes that after the outbreak of the war in Northern Europe, no country can avoid the disaster of war. It is a great mistake for the Italian people to fantasize that Italy can ultimately avoid participating in the war, or to fantasize that Italy only needs to seek foreign exchange profits. Small countries like Norway can barely avoid being drawn into the vortex of war, let alone Italy, which is a neighbor of the belligerent countries and has various interests in the Mediterranean. How can it avoid participating in the war? Italy has strengthened its military preparations and is waiting for an opportunity that is beneficial to Italy. This opportunity seemed remote a month ago, but it is now imminent. We should not only prepare for war materially, but also mentally, in preparation for a war that may break out in one or two weeks."

This is a reaction to the development of the European war to Northern Europe, and a step forward after the preliminary stage of the second phase of the European war. But which direction are Italy's cannons pointing? The speech did not give anyone a clue, not to mention that moving forward and turning around are both common and easy movements for any team! There was also a rumor yesterday, claiming that:

"According to Balkan diplomatic circles last night, Prime Minister Mussolini has concentrated his fleet at the entrance of the Dardanelles, near the Dodecanese Islands. This new naval mobilization by Italy is considered to be part of the Rome-Berlin Axis strategy, which is believed to have been discussed by the leaders of Germany and Italy at the Brenner Pass meeting last month. At the same time, it is claimed that Prime Minister Mussolini is preparing to mobilize 1.25 million reservists in an attempt to crush the mutual assistance treaty between the Allies and Turkey."

This explains the direction, but it is highly suspicious, because the telegram was broadcast by the American United Press, the source of the telegram was London, England, the news was based on so-called Balkan diplomatic circles, and the target of the transmission was the Dardanelles. Because of all of this, who can get to the bottom of it?

The news about Italy cannot be ignored or disregarded because of Italy's international position in Europe. Besides, Italy really has no intention of remaining a bystander for long. What should be recognized separately is that a newspaper manager's speech is not the same as a government order, and a broadcast to the army is not the same as a declaration to the international community. Orders and declarations are truly the forte of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, his son-in-law. The current war in Northern Europe has indeed alarmed Italy, and the news from Italy can certainly alarm the belligerent countries, such as Italy's expression at this time that it is not satisfied with foreign exchange profits. But the meaning behind this action is not an attack or surrender. The Italian army, navy, and air force have the power to launch an offensive, but their defenses cause the Italian authorities to deliberate carefully. Therefore, even if Italy is preparing to take action in the war, it will never rashly decide the direction of its offensive based on the four cornerstones of its foreign policy, but will have to decide its direction based on its army, navy, and air force defenses. The claim that Italy is preparing for a war that may break out in one or two weeks can be temporarily seen as the outcome of the war in Northern Europe being decided in one or two weeks. One or two weeks is truly a fleeting moment in history, and this is an annotation of Italy's desire not to remain a bystander for long.

### Japan Built a Large Airfield on Hainan Island Capable of Accommodating 1,600 Aircraft for Expanding Its Influence in the South Seas

Chongqing: Following reports that Japan may take advantage of the European war to seize the Dutch East Indies, Chinese officials are closely watching developments in the South Pacific. The "Saodang Daily" published an editorial on this matter, stating that foreign countries with interests in the Pacific should pay serious attention to this matter. The European war is closely related to the Sino-Japanese war. China must now intensify its war of resistance to prevent Japan from transferring troops to expand into the South Pacific. At the same time, all countries should not only actively assist China, but also protect their own interests in the Pacific. According to well-informed Chinese sources, the Japanese have built a large airfield on Hainan Island capable of accommodating 1,600 aircraft. This preparation by the Japanese is clearly not for fighting against China, but for expanding their influence in the South Pacific. (Reuters dispatch of the 15th)

### Relief Commission Orders Henan to Handle Industrial Relief

Luoyang: The Central Relief Commission believes that to relieve refugees, industrial relief should be promoted. For example, in Fugou and Weishi counties of Henan Province, more than 40,000 acres of land have been flooded. A dike project requires 250,000 yuan. If various projects can be started, the problem of 200,000 refugees can be solved. Therefore, it was decided to start construction before the flood season. 43,500 yuan has been allocated and handed over to the Henan Provincial Government to be handled jointly with the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission.

### Japanese Political Offensive Soviet Newspaper Continues Commentary

Chongqing: Moscow News: Soviet newspapers continue to comment on Japan's political offensive. The Moscow Bolshevik newspaper commented (Japan's Puppet Stage), stating that after years of painful struggle, Japan has actually staged its puppet show on the Chinese stage, which proves that the theater group is encountering great difficulties. The war expenses consumed by Japan in China have emptied the national treasury, and Japan's national economy has suffered the greatest blow as a result. After 33 months of war against China, the number of Japanese casualties has reached 1.5 million. Although the Japanese side regards the war against China as a (historical mission), the Japanese government cannot explain to the people of the whole country why it is necessary to make such sacrifices. Recently, more than 3,000 people in Japan have been arrested for anti-war activities. The other side of Japan's inner heart can be seen from this. Japan now places great hope on Wang Jingwei because Japan hopes to use him to save Japan's crisis. Wang's administrative program was formulated in Tokyo. The outline of the program is the same as what Doihara advocated. It is not known whose handwriting it is. (Dispatch of the 15th)

### Japan Holds Emergency Cabinet Meeting to Discuss Future of Dutch East Indies; Tokyo Newspaper Opposes Protection by Britain and the United States; British and Japanese Foreign Ministers Meet with Dutch Envoys

Tokyo: Prime Minister Yonai held talks with Foreign Minister Arita at his official residence at 11:00 AM on the 15th, listening to his report on the situation in Northern Europe and the current situation of the focus of work in the Netherlands. He then invited the Director of the West Asia Bureau and held a heavy meeting with the Prime Minister and Foreign Ministers. At 1:30 PM, a temporary emergency cabinet meeting was convened at the Prime Minister's official residence. The participants were the cabinet ministers below Prime Minister Yonai (excluding the two ministers Fujiwara and Yoshida who were traveling). After Yonai and Arita reported in detail on the current European situation, they stated that if the flames of war spread to the Netherlands, Japan would still adhere to the policy of non-intervention in the European war, but in the Pacific, the relationship with the Dutch East Indies would inevitably be of great concern. After discussion among the cabinet ministers, it was unanimously agreed that the Japanese government should still adhere to the policy of non-intervention in the European war, but should try its best to avoid the spread of the war to the Pacific. Therefore, the Japanese government will issue a statement of "Non-intervention and Peaceful Defense of the Pacific" within days, and at the same time issue this instruction to overseas envoys to clarify Japan's policy to various countries. (Domei News Agency dispatch of the 15th)

Tokyo: Several newspapers here discussed yesterday what would happen to the fate of the Dutch East Indies if Britain dragged the Netherlands into the war. The newspapers speculated that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie had explained to Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki the attitude that Britain would take towards the Dutch East Indies. According to the "China and Foreign Business News", Britain may have the possibility of controlling the Dutch East Indies, but at the same time it guarantees that it will not affect Japan's trade. The "Tokyo Asahi Shimbun" reported that the fate of the Dutch East Indies will have the following two possibilities: (1) Britain will control or protect the Dutch East Indies on the grounds that it is adjacent to Singapore; (2) If the Dutch government flees to the Dutch East Indies, it will be protected by the United States. The "Kokumin Shimbun", which has close ties with the military, claimed that whether Britain or the United States occupied the Dutch East Indies, it would be a threat to Japan, and Japan could not allow the islands to be a base for Britain or the United States to advance eastward.

London: According to responsible sources here, regarding the silver issue in the British Concession in Tianjin, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie is continuing talks with the Japanese government in a friendly atmosphere.

Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters today that as a result of talks between Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki and Englishman Craigie on Saturday morning, a compromise on the Tianjin silver issue is imminent. However, the exact date of the resolution could not be determined. The spokesman replied to a question from a foreign reporter that all the detailed details of this matter had been thoroughly discussed by Tani Masayuki and Craigie, but Craigie needed to report this matter to his government for instructions. The European war has nothing to do with the silver issue, and this is not an important issue, but there are various technical relationships that need to be carefully considered.

### Swedish National Socialist Party's Conspiracy to Launch Uprising Fails Swedish Authorities Take Strict Precautions

Paris: Well-informed sources here recently said that the Swedish government had received information that the country's National Socialist Party planned to launch an uprising on the evening of the 11th of this month. The party's various groups had received orders to occupy all the important strongholds of Sweden at the same time. The government immediately took various preventive measures, and the National Socialist Party's conspiracy failed. Swedish Prime Minister Hansson said in a broadcast speech to the nation on the 12th of this month, "We must closely monitor the staff who work for foreign countries," referring to this matter. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)

Stockholm: Observers here generally believe that the troops that Germany has concentrated in Denmark since the 9th of this month originally intended to attack Sweden, which will resolutely resist. Germany's current control of Denmark is similar to the protectorate it has established in the Czech Republic, but the German troops have orders to avoid cruel acts, which is the difference. All deposits of foreigners in Denmark have been confiscated, and permits are required to purchase goods. At present, food is decreasing day by day. In the future, various raw materials needed for agriculture in the country will not be imported, and the food situation of the people will become more serious. In short, if the military preparations of Denmark and Norway were more substantial, and they were determined to aid Finland at that time, they would not be invaded at this time. However, although the Scandinavian countries are fraternal states, their close relations are limited to cultural aspects and have no concrete foundation. Before being invaded, Denmark had already felt uneasy and asked Sweden for help, but the Swedish authorities replied that what the country feared was the Soviet Union, not Germany. This situation of sleeping in the same bed with different dreams is enough to lead wolves into the house. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)

### German Troops Ambushed in a Small Village on the Western Front

Paris: General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 444, stating that "The enemy's infantry attempted to use artillery fire to cover their intrusion into our country's positions on the slopes of the Vosges Mountains, but were severely wounded and retreated." (Havas dispatch of the 14th)

London: A Reuters special correspondent in the center of the French army recently telegraphed that in a small village in the opposing positions, 20 French African Algerian rapid-fire soldiers were ambushed for five nights. Last night, a team of German patrol soldiers of about 50 accidentally entered the village. As soon as the guns rang out, the captain fell to the ground, and the rest fled in panic. Seven people hid in a house. At dawn, the Algerian rapid-fire soldiers entered the village to search, and the seven surrendered. The recent Western Front war report of the French side stated that the enemy infantry west of the Voss district River used the cover of the artillery team to attack the French positions, but were wounded and retreated.

### The Soviet Union Will Not Attack Sweden If Germany Invades Sweden It May Intervene

Paris: The attitude of the Soviet Union towards the war in Northern Europe has recently been commented on by observers here, who said that the country will not attack Sweden for a while. This can be seen from the fact that Germany abides by the peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union, and the Red Army in the Bega-Momo port area of Finland will be withdrawn on schedule. However, if German troops do invade Sweden, the Soviet Union will send troops to intervene and share a piece of the pie. As for France and Britain, they will not take hostile actions against the Soviet Union, but if the Soviet Union sends troops to aid Germany, France and Britain will regard it as an enemy country and treat it as they would treat Germany.

Moscow: Reuters reported that the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union had asked Molotov to allow Germany to use Murmansk and the Murmansk Railway to transport troops to Norway, and said that the Soviet government had rejected this request.

TASS recently authorized the official certification that Reuters' report is completely inconsistent with the facts, as the German side has never made this request to the Soviet Union. (TASS dispatch of the 14th)

It stated, "Our country has always maintained friendly relations with Germany, but now we have been subjected to aggression by this nation. Our people have suffered from aerial bombardment, and women and children have been especially harmed. Our country is now in a situation where even I and the Crown Prince and the government authorities do not know where we will be tomorrow. There was an instance where we were in a small city with no air defense equipment, and we were heavily bombed by German aircraft, which is clear evidence. I earnestly pray to God to bless our country." (Havas, 15th)

### US Newspaper Advocates Taking Over Greenland; No Country in the Western Hemisphere Can Tolerate Conquest by Another Country

Chicago – Colonel Knox, the Republican candidate in the 1936 election and manager of the "Chicago Daily News," recently published an article in that newspaper arguing that the American "Monroe Doctrine" should be extended to Danish-owned Greenland. During the current European war, Greenland should be temporarily handed over to the Canadian Federation or the Dominion of Newfoundland for merger. The United States should cooperate in this matter. If not, the United States should take over sovereignty of the island until the end of the European war. In addition, Major Eliot, a military affairs reporter for the "New York Herald Tribune," published an article in that newspaper stating, "The United States cannot tolerate any European country ceding any land it currently holds in the Western Hemisphere to any non-American country, or being conquered by a non-American country, or any non-American country establishing new naval, land, or air bases in the Western Hemisphere. It is time to clearly state this position to all countries in the world. In view of this situation, the United States' policy does not allow for hesitation or indecision, and when necessary, it should be backed by force." (Havas, 15th)

### Two Danish and Norwegian Ships Sail from the Philippines

Manila – The Danish ship "Panama" and the Norwegian ship "Trelysman" sailed from Manila yesterday, heading for an unknown destination. This clearly disregards the order issued by the British Admiralty that Danish and Norwegian ships should immediately sail into British ports. The two ships were originally supposed to go to Hong Kong or Shanghai. Shipping sources reported today that the "Panama" had already turned out of the San Bernardino Strait via the American Pacific coast. These two ships are the first ships of Danish and Norwegian nationality to leave here after Germany occupied Denmark and Norway.

### Hitler's Gift to the Allied Powers: Danish and Norwegian Merchant Fleets

New York – The New York Times reported that Hitler has now given the Allied Powers the merchant fleets of Norway and Denmark as a gift. The total tonnage of these fleets exceeds the Allied merchant ships sunk by German submarines since the beginning of the war. Britain has never received a better gift from the enemy in this or any other war. This will make it even more difficult for the Germans to trap Britain or prevent the Allied Powers from gaining an absolute advantage in military materials. (Reuters, 15th)

### War Threatens US Interests: US Newspaper Discusses Northern European War

London – According to special dispatches from here, New York newspapers reported the news of German destroyers being destroyed in Narvik as the most important news. The New York Times stated that the existence of this country depends on the outcome of the war around Norway is not only for the belligerent countries. Every neutral country, no matter how far from Europe, and no matter how determined it is to stay out of the war, must reassess its position in light of the outcome of Germany's advance. Germany will not hesitate to launch this attack if it gains a strategic advantage by defeating any neutral country. This fact is now clear. The New York Tribune stated that the war is approaching us day by day. The fate of Greenland now brings the war to our doorstep. If the Netherlands is invaded, the fate of the Dutch island of Curaçao and the West Indies will extend the war to within a stone's throw of the American Panama defense zone. Today is like 1917. People think of war and are afraid, but today the threat of war to the United States is greater than the victory of the United States and the defeat of Germany. The United States will undoubtedly face the possibility that it will only be able to protect its own interests by being forced to join the war. (Reuters, 15th)

### Britain Continues to Requisition American Dollar Securities

London – On February 18, the British government issued an order to requisition 60 types of American securities held by British citizens. Now, it has ordered that 117 types of American dollar securities issued by 108 American companies must be transferred to the control of the British Treasury. This does not mean that all of the previously requisitioned securities have been sold. The Treasury has no intention of selling the American securities it has obtained on the market. The Treasury's principle is not to disrupt the American market. If American banks and trust companies cannot immediately absorb the sold securities, the British authorities will sell them later, waiting for Wall Street to have sufficient absorptive capacity. Financial circles say that if Wall Street's business activities can absorb the American securities sold by Britain, there will be no difficulty. Some of the securities requisitioned by the British government this time are collateral bonds, which are different from those requisitioned last time. American Steel common stock, Chrysler Motors common stock, and New York Central Railroad common stock are also included in this requisition. It is expected that the British government will continue to issue orders to requisition other types of securities at any time. (Reuters, 15th)

### Central Museum Studies Prehistoric Culture in Dali

(Kunming Correspondence) The National Central Museum, in addition to collecting folk customs data in Xikang, discovered a total of 17 ancient tombs and 12 ancient sites in Dali, Yunnan, in 1928. Among them, seven belong to the prehistoric period, and five belong to the Nanzhao period. Five sites have been excavated, of which three belong to the prehistoric period. The work is relatively detailed.

The prehistoric culture of Dali includes five periods. There are stone tools in each period, and the shape changes very little. The pottery of each period has its own characteristics. The characteristic of the pottery in the first period is red sandy pottery with impressed patterns on the surface. The pottery in the second period is the same as in the first period, but the patterns are more complex. The third period is black sandy pottery, sometimes with patterns. Red sandy pottery was popular again in the fourth period, but the epidermis has a layer of red coating and is polished brightly. The fifth period is rope-patterned pottery made by stamping. Comparing the prehistoric culture of Dali with the Yangshao and Longshan cultures of North China, they have both similarities and differences. The three types of stone tools: axes, chisels, and planes, as well as rectangular stone knives, are very similar. However, the crescent-shaped stone knife produced in Dali is close to a bow shape, with the blade opening on the back of the bow, which is not found in North China. The forms and methods of making pottery bowls and basins are similar to those of Yangshao pottery. From the third period onwards, there are utensils similar to beans, cooking utensils with pointed feet, and tripods, all of which are commonly found in North China. The rope-patterned pottery made by stamping in the fifth period is exactly the same as that produced in North China. However, fragments of pottery with stamped intermittent patterns are common in Dali, which are not found anywhere in North China except Gansu. The prehistoric culture of Dali has its own characteristics, so it can form a system. Although the Yangshao and Longshan cultures of North China have both similarities and differences, they also have considerable relations with other ancient Chinese cultures. The museum has set up a working station in Dali, which is presided over by Mr. Wu Jinding, to handle excavation matters. In addition, Ms. Zeng Zhaogiong and Mrs. Wu assisted in the research. Most of the workers used in the excavation work last year were women, which is only seen in the history of archeology.

### Opening of Fujian University

President Qiu Encourages Students to Study Hard

(Yong'an Correspondence) After completing the registration procedures for new students on March 28 and 29, Fujian Provincial Fujian University opened on the 1st of this month. That day happened to be the National Monthly Meeting and Commemorative Week. A Commemorative Week was held in the school's auditorium. All teachers and students attended and participated. President Qiu Hanping presided and led the ceremony. He then gave a speech on the school's purpose and his hopes for the students, saying that people generally like to recall the past and imagine the future, but they miss the present. In fact, the present is the necessary stage for the past and the future. Without the present, there is no past or future. The present is the most precious. All students should seize it, make full use of it, and enjoy it. The Fujian Provincial Government believes that the War of Resistance must build the country, and building the country must cultivate talents. In view of the lack of legal, agricultural, and medical talents in the province and the relationship between academic research and local characteristics, it spares no effort to operate this university regardless of the current difficult environment. Its expectations for the students of the school are extremely deep, especially those of Chairman Chen and everyone else are even more earnest. He hopes that everyone can do the following six things: (1) Implement a new life, (2) conscientiously study knowledge, (3) respect teachers and be friendly to friends, (4) serve the country and society, (5) cultivate a spirit of perseverance, and (6) love things and practice labor service. Throughout history, among the 450 million compatriots in our country, very few have received higher education. All students are now able to study here, under the guidance of good professors, and their expenses are jointly borne by the 13 million compatriots in this province. This is really a unique advantage. Therefore, I personally hope that everyone can make full use of the present opportunity, conscientiously study knowledge, develop good habits, and do their best to serve their hometown after graduation. Don't think for yourself, otherwise you will be letting down the government and the cultivation of the compatriots in this province. Then, he led the National Monthly Meeting, explained the outline of Chapter 5 of the Spiritual Mobilization, reported current events, and instructed the students to go to the countryside to lead the people to hold monthly meetings, so as to achieve the true effect of spiritual mobilization. Finally, he introduced the professors. In addition to Provost Wu Zhifang, the newly hired professors are Professor and Head of the Accounting Department Chen De, Business Mathematics Lecturer and Director of General Affairs Huo Sihua, Economics Professor Fu Zhida, History Professor Shen Lianzhi, Mathematics and Physics Professor Shi Yanhan, and Lecturer Qian Zongqi.

### Yarn and Flowers: Cotton Yarn Bulls are Drunk and Mad, and Double Horses are Lifted to 1,400 Yuan, and There are Daily Rumors of Empty Households Running Aground

The yarn market rose, and the rising trend became more intense. This situation is very terrifying, but the enthusiastic atmosphere in the market is still brave, jumping every day, with a strong sense of endless rise. However, the current internal chip turnover is tighter, and the actual sales are sluggish. Once the spot goods loosen, the reaction afterwards must be guarded against. Generally, stockpilers are still absorbing strongly.

The current opening of the yarn market was that the British and American exchange rates increased, and the foreign cotton was also weak, but the popularity remained tense, and the buying sentiment was strong. The 20-count double horse factory order increased by 1,325 yuan. However, the buyers were enthusiastic, and the market price step by step increased, until 1,395 yuan, and the actual increase was outside the 1,400 yuan mark.

However, although the rising trend is fierce, there are rumors that the shorts are unable to support those who run aground, and more and more families are going bankrupt. The certain yarn market is even more unstable, and judging from the unloading situation, the bulls are also ready to give up. Because if it rises wildly, earning money, I am afraid I will not be able to get it.

### Factory Offices Turn Smooth, Cotton Prices Higher

Yesterday's daily forecast fell by 3 rupees, and Egypt fell by 10 pounds.

Yesterday's foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was due to the high price of yarn, the shrinkage of the exchange rate, the expansion of the silent situation, and the difficulty of transporting Indian cotton. The peers searched for spot goods on the market quite fiercely, especially for the raw materials for spinning 20-count yarns. There was a concern that there was no cotton to buy.

The trading was very lively at the morning auction due to the crowded orders decided overnight. Almost all kinds of industrial stocks had buyers' interest, of which British United, Steel, and Jardine were the most active. The demand for the shares of each holding company was also good, but the transaction was not very strong. The buyers' intention to increase their positions was not diminished throughout the day, and the price rose slowly until the end, when the bulls' power was stronger and the evening closing price was the best of the day.

Rubber stocks were ignored. Although the exchange market was firm, investors seemed to be intentionally coming out of the rubber stocks and exchanged them for industrial stocks for the time being, so the majority of prices decreased.

### Grain Prices: Rice Market Turns Flat

Yesterday's rice market started weak but tightened later, eventually closing flat. The early market saw original wholesalers holding firm, while retailers showed little interest. A stalemate prevailed, and sales were unusually slow. Eventually, holders of surplus stock lost heart and began to sell off, dropping prices by more than half a yuan. Mainstream retailers then started to buy in small quantities. Sorted Xiaojiao was sold for 40 yuan, Saigon No. 1 for 44.3 yuan, and No. 2 for 41.2 yuan. Inland clients also started to scoop up cheap goods, and sales quickly increased. The market rapidly turned upward, seemingly poised to break the previous week's high prices. However, wholesalers suddenly released large quantities of their holdings, causing supply to meet demand and halting the upward momentum. Prices remained stable, with no changes by closing. Closing prices matched those of the previous week. As for japonica and glutinous rice, the Da Chang Company from Hongkou imported over 5,000 bags into the Settlement. Due to soaring prices in the Japanese market, japonica transactions saw prices exceeding the upper limits, leading sellers to hold onto their stock. There were no samples available on the market, and private deals were unprofitable. Standard High Japonica was priced at 45 yuan, Medium at 43-44 yuan, Changzhou and Kun Japonica at 43-44 yuan, Suzhou-Tong Japonica at 44 yuan and 43.5 yuan, Powder Japonica at 42-43 yuan, Qingzhou Special Thin at 45 yuan, Chong Special at 44 yuan, General Market at 43.5 yuan and around 43 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice at 42 yuan, down to 41.5 yuan. The glutinous rice market mirrored other varieties, holding steady without significant fluctuations.

Yesterday, 11,000 bags of rice were transported to Tianjin on the Taikoo Company's Nanchang vessel, along with 1,500 bags of corn, which were customs-rejected on the Shuntian vessel and reloaded onto the Nanchang for Tianjin. These foreign rice shipments were finalized by the Da孚 Foreign Firm.

Foreign rice remained stable in the morning. Although Nanyang brokers purchased nearly 10,000 bags of Sorted Xiaojiao, Saigon, and Siamese rice, prices only increased by 3-4 jiao. By the afternoon, rumors spread widely, including that neutral countries were joining the war and that long-term orders were hopeless. These rumors were promoted by large speculative firms. With new firms becoming active and retailers competing to buy, the market suddenly tightened. Spot and futures prices rose uniformly. Saigon No. 1 for future delivery, which opened at 52.5 yuan in the morning, jumped to 54 yuan in the afternoon, a significant increase of 1.5 yuan. No. 2 for April/May delivery, which opened at a low of 51.5 yuan in the morning, gradually rose to 52.3 yuan, then opened at 52.5-53.3 yuan in the afternoon, climbing steadily and rising by 1.8 yuan from morning to afternoon. Spot Saigon No. 1 opened at 45 yuan in the morning, increased by half a yuan, and then reached 46 yuan in the afternoon. Other rice varieties rose in tandem, with afternoon high prices nearly a yuan higher than morning prices. Overall trading was active, totaling 17,000-18,000 bags of spot rice and 700 tons of futures.

### Flour Firm, Wheat Holds Steady

The flour market is showing strength. The No. 1 Flour Mill's list price remains at 13.5 yuan. Amid international stability and high commodity prices, mills consider their list price to maintain the local market's nature, so they are temporarily not increasing it. However, retail sales in local shops are slow. While there has been a slight increase in wholesale purchases recently, wholesale prices remain high at 15 yuan, deterring retailers. Limited purchases are still made occasionally. No. 4 flour is priced at 12 yuan, prompting some buying by wholesalers. The old brand numbers for returned goods are depleted. Yesterday, 2-3,000 bags were traded in the local market and inland, with 7-8,000 bags distributed by mills. The market is gradually becoming more active due to the high price of gold and rising rice prices, as well as disruptions to railway transportation.

The wheat market remains at a standstill. After prices fell to 21.5 yuan, holders were reluctant to sell. Furthermore, domestic wheat supplies are dwindling, and foreign wheat orders are becoming increasingly expensive. With mills experiencing slow demand and seeking to maintain lower inventories, a stalemate has developed between buyers and sellers.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Sales Active, Prices Rise Half a Yuan

Yesterday's soybean market started calmly. Exports to Hong Kong and Xiamen, along with domestic demand from oil mills and local speculators, boosted sentiment and slightly increased prices. In the afternoon, rumors of Italy joining the European war spread, leading speculators to believe there was an opportunity. The market was encouraged, and prices rose. High-quality soybeans rose by another half a yuan, with medium and lower grades also increasing slightly. A total of three truckloads of Bengbu soybeans were traded at 20.5 yuan, over eight hundred bags of Anqing soybeans at 22.5-22 yuan, six hundred bags of Wuhu soybeans at 21 yuan and 20.02 yuan, five hundred bags of Qingdao soybeans at 27.5 yuan, and three hundred bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans at 22.8 yuan. Today (16th), 2,180 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Continues to Decline, Zhejiang Silk Has Some Transactions

Yesterday, there was no trading in New York. Yokohama spot silk was priced at 1510 yuan, near-term at 1508 yuan, down 40 yuan each, and long-term at 1514 yuan, down 42 yuan. There was no activity in the foreign firm silk market. Zhejiang's Special Superior Grade New York City brand was priced at 2700 yuan, and the secondary brand Racecourse Grade at 2300 yuan, the same as the previous market. There were no transactions for White Silk Factories, and Indian firms were also quiet. Only about 25 dan of Zhejiang silk was traded.

### Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Increases by Half a Yuan

According to a telegram from Hong Kong, Taikoo refined white sugar B mark has risen to HK$16.05, up HK$0.45. Consequently, the local Sugar Guild also adjusted its prices accordingly. Spot Second Grade Coarse White from foreign warehouses just arrived was initially priced at 63.78 yuan, then 63.9-63.95 yuan, and finally 64.3 yuan. Transit goods remained at 51 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar increased by half a yuan. B mark Western Warehouse initially priced at 65.5-65.8 yuan, later 67 yuan. Other prices include Refined Red Sugar H mark decreasing by 7 jiao, initially at 49 yuan, later at 50 yuan. Dutch red sugar at 52.78-53 yuan, up 2 jiao. Local snow white sugar at 63 yuan, Local No. 1 crystal sugar at 76.5 yuan, Crystal clear ice sugar at 78 yuan. National sugar: Drawn Green strip sold 46 pieces at 39 yuan, Shimen sliced green over 100 bags at 43.5 yuan.

### Dried Fruits and Nuts: Longan from Quanzhou, Local Speculators Buy Up All Stock

Yesterday, a letter from Quanzhou stated that local Quanzhou speculators had bought up all longan stock, increasing purchase prices by 18 yuan. The price of new longans has also increased. However, Shanghai is not actually selling them, and no imports have been opened for sale. Market conditions are on the decline. More and more uncertain.

### Japanese Troops from Jiangwan Head West, Fierce Fighting Erupts on Qinghu Road, Over a Thousand Japanese Troops Advance from Zhao Xiang, Chinese Troops Under Gu Fusheng Fight Back

Yesterday morning (April 15th) at dawn, residents in the Hongqiao Road area on the edge of the Settlement suddenly heard the sounds of artillery fire, intermittent but continuous. According to travelers from the Qinghu Highway and Hongqiao Road, a large-scale engagement occurred between guerrillas southwest of Zhaoxiang Town on the Qinghu Highway, about 30 kilometers from Shanghai, and Japanese troops. The ferocity of the fighting was unprecedented in past guerrilla warfare around Shanghai. Most of the Japanese troops in the Jiangwan district of Shanghai had been dispatched to the Qinghu Highway to fight.

Four Japanese Tanks Deployed

Reportedly, seventeen Japanese military trucks, fully loaded with about six to seven hundred Japanese soldiers, along with four tanks, had previously passed through the Da Xi Road, Zhongshan Road, Hongqiao Road, and then turned onto the Qinghu Highway to be stationed in Zhaoxiang Town. At the same time, Japanese troops were also increased in various strongholds west of Shanghai, such as Huangdu, Nanxiang, Panlong, Zhudi, Xujing, and Caohejing, from dozens to one or two hundred. At dawn at five o'clock yesterday morning, a large force of Japanese troops launched a major offensive southwest from Zhaoxiang, attacking the troops of Gu Fusheng, the third detachment of the Songhu Guerrilla Force. This was where the main force of Gu's troops was located, so they bravely engaged in battle.

Fierce Fighting Continues into the Evening

The number of Japanese troops mobilized was over 1,500, while the Chinese side also had a considerable number. Therefore, it is believed that both sides suffered extremely heavy losses. As for the outcome of the battle, the travelers reported that they left Qibao, near the boundary of Qingpu, at 2:00 PM, and the fighting had been raging for seven hours and had not yet stopped. When they reached Hongqiao Town, they could still hear the intense sound of machine-gun fire. They also learned that Gu's troops had attacked Japanese and puppet troops under Xu Xingzhou and Yu Taosheng at Dujia Xing, west of Qibao, on the afternoon of the 12th of this month. It seems that this Japanese action was in retaliation. It is also reported that the Japanese troops deployed yesterday were from the Tanaka unit, while the Chinese troops were from Gu Fusheng's unit.

Japanese Troops in Anting Rush to Build Fortifications

According to someone from Kunshan, Anting Station, along the Jinghu Railway, is located at the intersection of Kunshan and Qingpu, and Huangdu Station is located at the intersection of Qingpu, Pei County, and Jiading, all near Shanghai and less than 20 kilometers from Shanghai. There were already guerrilla forces in these areas, stationed with puppet troops, and they had agreed not to fight each other. The puppet troops were responsible for providing intelligence. The Japanese army was aware of this but sought peace and dared not interfere. However, recently, over a thousand New Fourth Army soldiers arrived in the area and have absorbed the guerrillas and puppet troops. Fearing this, the Japanese troops have retreated to the train station and are rushing to build fortifications, working very busily.

### European War Has No Impact on Rice Prices, Rumors Refuted, Rice Market Stabilizes Again

After the rice market to Japan slightly increased due to speculators' rumors that the European war was impacting foreign rice shipments to Shanghai, the market has stabilized as the rumors have been disproven and domestic rice supplies have gradually become more accessible. The Rice Trade Market Tea Party issued Public Announcement No. 131 yesterday stating, "This market's spring entry permits, expiring on the 14th of this month, are all invalidated. For the summer new permits, rice merchants should still exchange them through the Rice Merchants Guild, brokers should collect them through the Friendship Association, and all members of our industry and sales companies must bring their old permits and three months' worth of tea fees within the scheduled period from the 15th to the 17th of this month, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, to the North Office to exchange for new permits. The "Compilation of Broker Companies" has been published and is priced at 5 jiao per copy, which can be collected with payment. This announcement is hereby made for general information."

### Chinese Taxpayers' Association Writes to Hotel Industry Regarding Increased Tax Negotiations

The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Settlement previously responded to the request of the Hotel Industry Guild to forward a letter to the Public Works Department to negotiate a reduction in the business license tax for hotels. The Association has already forwarded the letter to the Public Works Department, but has not yet received a response from the Department. The Taxpayers' Association has now responded to the Hotel Industry Guild, detailing the progress of the negotiations.

### Difficult to Dissolve Refugee Camps, Those Willing to Return Home Given Travel Expenses, Elderly and Weak to Be Assisted

Although there has been talk of disbanding charity organizations in the city, according to the person in charge of the Refugee Relief Association, only the Dunxin Road First Refugee Camp is directly under the Association. Other organizations, such as the Ciliantonghui and Cilianfenhui, still have 32 refugee camps. These camps mainly provide free rice and coal, supplied by the Refugee Relief Association. Although supplies are currently difficult and dispersal is actively underway, there is no guarantee that they will be forcibly dissolved on the 30th. As it is currently the spring plowing season, some young and strong refugees are willing to return to their hometowns to make a living and will be given some travel expenses by the camp. However, for the elderly and weak, methods of resettlement must still be sought.

### New Auxiliary Coins of the Ministry of Finance Flow into the Shanghai Market; Aluminum Coins' First Batch Issued, Second Batch Arrives in Shanghai; Application System Still Adopted for Receiving Fractional Currency Notes

After the Ministry of Finance adjusted the fineness and weight of various auxiliary coins, the Central Mint in Chengdu, Kunming, Guilin, Lanzhou, and other factories have been casting new auxiliary coins of one, two, five, and ten fen denominations. These new auxiliary coins have been reviewed and approved by the Review Committee and handed over to the Central Bank for issuance and circulation in the market. Although Shanghai does not import them for issuance, those that flow into Shanghai through other channels are also valid for normal use. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the new auxiliary coins are cast from a copper-zinc alloy, but the five and ten fen coins contain 18% nickel, hence their yellow color. Due to the highest copper content, the design features the "29th Year of the Republic of China, Blue Sky White Sun emblem" on the front and an ancient coin model with the denominations "One Fen," "Two Fen," "Five Fen," and "Ten Fen" on the reverse.

Aluminum Auxiliary Coins: First Batch Fully Issued

The aluminum one and five fen new auxiliary coins were issued exclusively in Shanghai after the Shanghai Banking Association requested and received approval from the Ministry of Finance. The first batch of ten million coins has already been fully issued, and the second batch of ten million coins, half one fen and half five fen, will be issued immediately after arriving in Shanghai, replacing the first batch. For the time being, only banks and native banks are allowed to receive them. All member banks and native banks of the Banking Association and member banks of the Foreign Banks Association can receive them from the Silver and Native Banks Clearing House and the British-owned HSBC. As for various companies, firms, and factories, they can exchange them in appropriate amounts from their usual banks and native banks.

Fractional Currency Notes Issued: 3 Million Yuan

The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank previously received approval from the Ministry of Finance to issue one and five fen fractional currency notes, with a total stipulated amount of seven million yuan, contracted to the American-owned Yongning Printing Company. The bank has been issuing them as needed based on market demand, to alleviate fears of a shortage of auxiliary coins. A total of approximately three million yuan has already been issued, with five fen notes accounting for the majority. The five fen notes are currently in high demand on the market. The issuance will not be suspended due to the issuance of aluminum auxiliary coins. However, for the sake of prudence, an application system will still be adopted. All businesses can apply to the bank if they have legitimate needs.

### Foreign Taxpayers to Hold Annual Meeting Tomorrow; Japanese Intend to Launch Political Offensive; Chinese Pay Attention to Proposed Tax Increase

The scale of gathering is comparable to the Board of Directors election of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers is scheduled for 2:30 PM tomorrow at the Race Course Grandstand. Judging from the current situation, the Japanese are likely to use the proposed 50% increase in municipal taxes at this annual meeting to launch an offensive against the Shanghai Municipal Council, potentially leading to a major Anglo-American political struggle against Japan. The British and Americans are extremely concerned that they have slightly fewer eligible voting taxpayers than the Japanese because the only votes that British and Americans can manipulate are those from the European expatriate group. With regard to the proposed tax increase, the Chinese community is sending messages hoping to avoid a serious problem by backing down before reaching the edge of a cliff. Details are described separately as follows:

Mo Su to Serve as Chairman of the Meeting

The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is scheduled to be held at the Race Course Grandstand at 2:00 PM tomorrow. The esteemed magistrate Mo Su will serve as the chairman. The Chairman of the Council, Mr. Fessenden, will report on the general situation of the Shanghai Municipal Council's administration over the past year. Among the proposals for discussion, the most important is the approval of the new budget of 16,000,000 yuan for 1940 to 1941, in addition to reviewing the annual financial statement for the previous year and revising the rules of procedure for the annual meeting. The Shanghai Municipal Council plans to increase the overall municipal tax, special property tax, and land tax surcharge by 50% starting from July of this year, which will be discussed in conjunction with the budget proposal and is receiving unanimous attention from all parties.

Chinese Community Focuses on Tax Increase Issue

Since the announcement of the proposed tax increase, there has been strong opposition from both Chinese and foreign taxpayers. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association has also lodged a written protest based on the wishes of taxpayers, requesting a halt before reaching the edge of the cliff. Now that the proposal is about to be discussed, a reporter inquired with a key member of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday. According to the member, the wishes of the absolute majority of Chinese should be respected by the authorities, and foreign taxpayers should also avoid creating problems for themselves. The consequences of the tax increase have been repeatedly stated; it not only increases the burden on taxpayers but also has a significant impact on the entire market and social order.

Hope Taxpayers Will Attend Unanimously

Currently, the election committees of the British, American, and Japanese communities are striving to secure the support of their respective backers to ensure their attendance at the annual meeting and to take concerted action. Significant progress has been made in recent days. The American Community Committee has held an emergency meeting specifically for this purpose, and in addition to the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget for the coming year, it has also printed a rebuttal to be distributed to taxpayers for their reference when attending the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers. The Japanese taxpayers have also gathered several times at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce on Peng Road to discuss how to deal with this year's annual meeting. The British Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. George, has already sent letters with his personal signature to all taxpayers, urging them to pay attention to the upcoming annual meeting of foreign taxpayers and to ensure that every taxpayer attends to maintain the rights and interests of the entire British community.

Japanese Residents Claim They Will Have Proposals

According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese are now trying their best to divide the opinions at this year's annual meeting of foreign taxpayers into two distinct camps. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council has announced that any proposals to be submitted to this year's annual meeting of foreign taxpayers must be written and submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council six days before the meeting, the semi-official Japanese newspaper, the Continental News, has ignored this point and claimed that the Japanese side will submit urgent temporary motions at this year's annual meeting. It is also learned that the Japanese taxpayers may hold a meeting tonight convened by Mr. Rin Yuji. According to sources with difficulty obtaining information, this meeting will decide whether the Japanese side will continue to adopt a political offensive to seek its superior position in the Shanghai Municipal Council.

Municipal Council Sends Personnel to Urge Participation

The Municipal Council also sent Chang to speak with expatriates from various countries yesterday, providing instructions on this year's annual meeting of foreign taxpayers, in order to increase taxpayers' interest and attend to vote. His words were roughly as follows: "Taxpayers must pay attention to the following: (1) You must attend this year's annual meeting. (2) The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers is scheduled for 2:30 PM tomorrow at the Race Course. (3) Unless the taxpayer is away from Shanghai or unable to attend due to illness, proxy voting is not allowed. (4) The Municipal Council's regulations on vehicles are as follows: After a taxpayer's car enters the entrance, it must drive around the race track once before being directed by the police to the parking area. (5) Official vehicles enter from Ma Huo Road and park at the jockeying area."

### Coal Industry Association Asks Authorities to Protect Coal Transport Vessels

The coal dealers of Maotai, Huaxiang, Zhengda, etc. in this city sent a letter to the Coal Industry Association yesterday, stating that the vessels of this company used to transport coal are often stolen and damaged by hooligans when entering and exiting the Suzhou Creek at night. These people disregard the law, swarming onto the ships, threatening and intimidating, and forcibly carrying away goods. This company is unable to resist due to the disparity in numbers. Furthermore, when the ships arrive at the McGon Road Yidaijiao Wharf to unload, a large number of vagrants gather to openly pick up and secretly steal, making it impossible to reason with them and unable to prevent them. Based on the above situation, this company has specially sent a letter to the association, requesting that the association submit a document to the police authorities of the Public Concession, requesting protection. According to Su merchants, the Coal Industry Association has forwarded it to the police department, requesting protection.

### French Commander Gasquevel to Leave Shanghai for France Tomorrow; Inspects National Defense Forces at the Race Course Yesterday; One of the Grandest Occasions in Shanghai Lately

At 10:00 AM yesterday, the British, American, Japanese, French, and Italian defense forces stationed in Shanghai were all lined up at the Jing'an Temple Road Race Course to be inspected by Colonel Gasquevel, the commander-in-chief of the French garrison stationed in Shanghai, who is about to leave Shanghai. The White Russian troops of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps also lined up to participate yesterday. It is understood that this inspection was one of the grandest occasions in Shanghai lately. Colonel Gasquevel drove his own car to the Race Course, escorted by six fully armed police officers. Upon arriving at the scene, he was greeted by senior officials from various countries' garrisons, expressing their welcome. Colonel Gasquevel then walked around the perimeter and shook hands with more than fifty senior military officers from various countries' garrisons to express his thanks. Colonel Gasquevel is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Paris tomorrow on the Jean Laborda. His successor will be Mr. Esdati.

### Marshall Writes About the Amazing Progress of Chinese Industry; The Southwestern Hinterland Fortress Has Become an Industrial Center; Brilliant Achievements That Are Already Self-Sufficient

The spring issue of the "China Quarterly" contains an article by Mr. Marshall, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, praising the development of Chinese industry. He believes that China's industrial advancement can not only achieve self-sufficiency but also enable the country to become wealthy and compete with other countries. His article reads in part:

Rapid Progress in Inland Industry

"As a result of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, most of China's modern new industrial areas were destroyed or fell into the hands of the Japanese. This was undoubtedly a great loss to China. However, as a result, Chinese industry was able to flourish in the rear, fully exert its strength, and enjoy the freedom and guarantee of development. It has been able to actively build and mass produce, far surpassing Chinese industry in 1937, which is truly amazing. According to reports from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section and the Central Government, we can see that Chinese industry has made rapid progress and reached a successful stage. On the contrary, in all the occupied areas, various factories have either shut down or are unable to recover. Even if some factories have resumed operations, they are difficult to compensate for their losses in 1937. This is not only due to the severity of the destruction, but the main reason is that most of them are operated by the Japanese.

Factories Scattered Like Stars

According to the report, industry in the non-occupied areas has not only seen extensive development, but the widespread distribution of factories has spread across various regions like stars. In addition, the 활발 of cooperative enterprises has enabled the newborn factories to embark on a bright future. But on the other hand, there are other factors, such as the increasing accessibility of transportation, the prosperity of foreign trade, and the large-scale development of raw materials. Due to the above-mentioned factors, southwestern and western China have opened up a brand new world and become the industrial center of the country.

Seeking Alternative Paths to Resolve Difficulties

However, the industry in western China still faces difficulties. This difficulty is not caused by competition with other parts, but its only difficulty lies in the obstruction of waterway transportation, and highway transportation has not yet been fully developed. The solution to the difficulty is only one, that is, to find a way to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway, but this plan has not yet been fully successful, and in fact, the completion of the railway is not something that can be achieved in two or three years. Therefore, the way to solve it is to find another way. Industrialists all over the country have concentrated their attention on how to break up large factories that have already been established into small factories, because the establishment of small factories and mechanical equipment are easier than large factories. However, judging from today's achievements, the output of China's newborn factories is actually enough to make China self-sufficient and not have to rely on foreign countries. Looking at the state of Chinese industry for the past two and a half years, it seems that there has been a great change. Those that were once regarded as important industrial areas are no longer noticed. On the contrary, those areas that were once barren have now become the most military important industrial areas."

### Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign Closed Yesterday

The anti-tuberculosis campaign initiated by local famous doctors Ding Fubao and Ding Huikang, which opened on the 15th of last month at the Hongqiao Sanatorium on Avenue Joffre, has been going on for a month and ended yesterday as scheduled. According to statistics from the Hongqiao Sanatorium, in this short month, a total of more than 2,100 people went for physical examinations, and more than 500 people needed to have X-rays taken. This shows the large number of common people in this city who suffer from tuberculosis. However, according to Chinese customs, most people who suffer from this type of disease are reluctant to talk about it. Moreover, in this time of rising prices, it is difficult to maintain a living, so how can there be extra money to take care of this? Since the Ding family initiated this campaign, the inspection fees have been low, so the general public has begun to pay attention to it. It is hoped that this campaign will be expanded from private to public, so that there will be no fear of economic exhaustion, and then it can become a permanent organization, because this kind of campaign is especially necessary to continue to promote.

### International Relief Committee Completes Mission; To Complete Closure Within the Month; Name Will Still Be Retained

The Shanghai International Relief Committee was organized by various leaders, charities, and Chinese and foreign individuals in Shanghai during the war. At that time, artillery fire was raging in the suburbs of Shanghai, and refugees had no way to escape. As an international organization, the committee entered and exited Hongkou, providing the most effective rescue efforts. Later, when the National Army withdrew westward, many refugees from the Nanshi area were also rescued by the committee, and the establishment of refugee zones was particularly meritorious. A total of six large-scale shelters were established to house displaced refugees, totaling no less than 200,000 people. The committee established a craft group, first creating refugee production, to save public funds. Last year, it also assisted the French Concession authorities in housing street beggars and providing them with education. Now that the refugees in Shanghai are being collectively housed by the Refugee Relief Association, and the number of people being housed is much smaller than before, it is believed that the mission has come to an end. Preparations are currently being made to complete the closure by the end of this month. However, the name of the International Relief Committee may still be retained.

### Ministry of Finance Orders All Customs Houses to Issue Wartime Allowances; Jianghai Customs House Has Already Paid

In order to take care of the livelihoods of customs officers in various places, the Ministry of Finance has issued "Wartime Allowances." Whether customs officers, tax police, or servants, all are paid at 40%. Those who receive a new salary of 100 yuan per month will receive an allowance of 40 yuan. The allowance will be cancelled as soon as the war stops, which shows the authorities' concern for their subordinates. According to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, the Jianghai Customs House originally planned to pay the allowance at the same time as the official salary on the 25th of this month. However, it is learned that the customs house has advanced the payment of the first batch, that is, those in the internal service, and paid them separately on the 12th and 13th of this month. The second batch is scheduled to be paid within today and tomorrow. The allowance is from March of this year, so the April allowance has not yet been paid. It is heard that it will be paid at one time on the 25th of this month. The smallest amount of the allowance is more than 10 yuan, and the largest is about 180 yuan. As for the previously approved rice subsidy, it will continue to be paid until the rice price drops below 15 yuan, then it will be cancelled. It is also learned that customs houses in other places have also been paying them separately.

### Overseas Chinese Patriot Ji Aji; Deeply Patriotic; Regrets Being Too Old to Enlist; Consecrates the Rest of His Salary to the Motherland

According to the Overseas Chinese Fundraising Association, Chiang Kai-shek's wife recently received 53 yuan from Ji Aji, a 67-year-old overseas Chinese hunter in Dutch Borneo, along with a letter stating that he has lived overseas for 30 years and has always been patriotic. If he were still young and strong, he would be willing to return to the country to join the war and be honored to sacrifice himself on the battlefield. Now that he is old and lacks funds, in order to fulfill his national duty, he will donate the rest of his salary to the motherland for the purpose of resisting aggression and reconstruction. According to records, when Ji Aji first arrived in Borneo, he was not in business. Several years ago, the economic recession affected Dutch East India, and Ji Aji's business failed, leading to bankruptcy. Since then, he has made a living by hunting. Last year, in August, he remitted 40 yuan and 4 small yuan and a corner separately to Chongqing.

### American Radio Station Still Subject to Radio Wave Interference; Equipment Can Be Used to Detect the Location of the Interference; But Shanghai Does Not Yet Have This Type of New Machine

The Continental Daily News reports that the wavelength of the American radio station XMHA in this city was still subject to external radio wave interference yesterday (14th), causing the Christian church sermons, music programs, and Mr. Alcott's news reports broadcast on the radio station yesterday morning until night to be affected. A Christian church reporter, during a broadcast last night at the radio station, denounced this as "malicious interference" and stated that listeners who could not clearly hear the sermons broadcast could obtain a printed full text. The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury also reported that according to the radio engineer, it is now possible to roughly determine the source of the interfering radio waves with equipment. However, to determine its exact location, special equipment is required, and Shanghai does not yet have this type of latest special equipment available. Therefore, the source of the interference to XMHA is not easy to find for the time being.

### Did the Japanese Election Failure Really Cause a Crisis? Commentary from the New York Min Sheng Forum; Small Troubles Are Also Worth Paying Attention To

Havas News Agency, 15th dispatch from Sisi, the results of the Shanghai Public Concession election of directors were recently commented on by the New York Min Sheng Forum, stating that the Japanese side originally hoped to control the Shanghai Municipal Council but did not achieve its wishes. From now on, it may cause a new crisis. The election of directors of the Shanghai Public Concession, although like a very small surface of water in a very small teapot, actually contains the possibility of causing a Pacific war... A Japanese spokesperson once said that they must win a majority of votes next year, so it is better to wait quietly at this time. But can the Japanese military wait quietly until next year? Judging by their intentions, their second step is likely to be through the hands of the "Nanjing regime" to demand the return of the concessions to the treaty countries. If so, it will inevitably be rejected by the governments of Britain and the United States. Then what will Japan do? Although this kind of trouble is very small, this teapot is the epitome of the Pacific. Therefore, this kind of small trouble is also worth paying attention to.

Suma Expressed Great Alarm

United Press International, Tokyo, 15th report, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma Yakichiro stated today that the results of the Shanghai Municipal Council elections greatly surprised him, saying that there were many shocking things before the election, such as the sudden increase in the number of votes in a certain aspect of the Public Concession, which was one of them.

Gu Zhuxuan confessed, "Last night I had dinner with friends at the Hongyun Club. I suddenly received an emergency phone call from home, saying that there was an urgent matter and instructing me to return immediately. After I hung up the phone, I took my car home. Who knew that the police were already waiting at my house? I was arrested as soon as I got out of the car, saying that I was suspected of instigating murder. I beg the judge to investigate thoroughly. I am really wronged." Judge Feng verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled to be tried jointly with Wei Shulin and others on the 17th of this month.

### Jingli of Dachong Restaurant Arrested on Suspicion of Receiving Stolen Goods

The robber Xu Abing recently robbed passers-by of gold cigarette cases and other ornaments in the French Concession and sold them at a low price to Feng Xiaoyun (46 years old), the local jingli of the Dachong Restaurant at the intersection of Zhengjia Bridge Street, Avenue Edward VII, and used the proceeds of 460 yuan.

### A Huge Amount of Money Was Robbed from Renji Zhuang on Jiujiang Road, Totaling More Than 19,000 Yuan in Losses

Ping News Agency reported that at 2:20 PM yesterday, four robbers broke into Renji Shenzhuang, located on the second floor of the Xiangyu Public Customs Declaration Agency, next door to the Western Section of the Pseudo-Unified Tax Bureau at No. 250 Jiujiang Road. Two of the robbers were armed with pistols. At that time, there were only two employees in the shop, who were negotiating the exchange of cash with six customers. They were shocked and at a loss when they saw this. The robbers then used ropes they brought with them to tie up everyone in the room, regardless of whether they were employees or customers, and forced the employees to open the silver safe. The employees had no choice but to hand over the key and open the safe. The robbers then reached in and took a gold ring, a gold pocket watch, and a large amount of banknotes, totaling 19,400 yuan. After packing them up, the two robbers without weapons left first. After a while, the two robbers with guns left the shop calmly and disappeared. The shop immediately reported to the Central Police Station. After hearing the report, the police station immediately dispatched detectives to the scene to investigate and strictly pursue the robbers.

At around 1:00 PM yesterday, four robbers suddenly broke into No. 10 Yinhua Street, Jiujiang Road. Three of the robbers brandished pistols and threatened to silence anyone. They robbed more than 550 yuan in legal tender and fled.

### Min Wenju's Lustful Courage Was Boundless, and He Tried to Rape a Friend's Wife

Chen Gao, a local female worker at the Shenxin Fifth Cotton Mill, 28 years old, lived with her husband and sister Chen Miaoxian at No. 174 Yanshan Road, Hongkou. At around 11:00 PM on the 12th of this month, while she was sleeping soundly, Min Wenju (24 years old, from Jiangbei, who had been working at the "China Workers' Welfare Association" at No. 127 Longjiang Road), broke into her bedroom on the pretext of visiting a friend. Seeing that she was lying on her back and not awake, he actually had boundless lustful courage and went forward to take off her small clothes, intending to rape her. She was awakened and grabbed Min, shouting loudly, causing a violent struggle. At that time, she lost a gold ring and a wristwatch that she was wearing. Min's chest was also scratched. As a result, Min still escaped. After she reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, the police station sent detective Qiu Sijiu to the "Welfare Association" on the morning of the 13th to arrest and detain Min. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Court. Lawyer Zhang Tiansa of the police station charged him with Article 32, Section 3 of the Criminal Law and requested a rescheduling. After the assigned judge interrogated him, he ordered the detention of the case to be investigated and verified again at a later date.

### Public Works Department Hygiene Report on Infectious Disease Statistics

Table of the number of illnesses and deaths in the week before midnight on April 13, 1940.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: I was shocked to read the news item in yesterday's edition of your newspaper stating, "Tai Linsheng, in the name of the Kangjiaqiao Citizens' Association, brought thugs to extort fees from Xie Yuming, a rickshaw puller at No. 61, and assaulted him." I have resided in Kangjiaqiao for decades, and I have always conducted myself properly in all my dealings with people. Recently, due to the damaged roads and clogged gutters in Kangjiaqiao, which become muddy bogs every time it rains heavily, I used my name to send a letter to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council to dredge the Kangjiaqiao sewers. The Public Works Department has already sent personnel to discuss the matter. The funding for road construction and public welfare projects has been voluntarily assumed by familiar factories and shops. I have never extorted fees from people in the name of the association. Furthermore, I have investigated and found that Tan Honghai resides at No. 61 Kangjiaqiao, and there is no division of the residence. 61 Route Cardinal Mercier is exclusively occupied by the Shen residence. This news is clearly a fabrication and a deliberate defamation of my reputation. After the incident, I investigated with the police station and found no evidence of assault, nor is there any record of such an incident at the hospital. I hereby request a correction. Yours sincerely, Qin Linsheng, April 15.

### Husband of "Madam Leng Xiang" and Dance Girl Convicted of Adultery, Each Sentenced to Three Months' Imprisonment, Suspended Sentence Granted

The local woman, Yin Junong, is twenty-six years old, daughter of the late famous Shanghai doctor Yin Shoutian. She was betrothed to Chen Zonghui (courtesy name Yuanliang), the second son of Chen Weiquan, a wealthy antique dealer from Nanjing residing at No. 12, Moliai Road, by matchmakers Xia Yingtang and Zhao Huihe, and married in the auditorium of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road in January of the 24th year of the Republic. They have since had two daughters. However, Yin enjoys Kunqu opera, often performing on stage, with the stage name "Madam Leng Xiang," and enjoys considerable fame in the Kunqu opera community. But Chen Zonghui, because his wife did not cater to his liking, caused the love between husband and wife to break down. Recently, Chen has been wandering outside, neglecting his business, and often frequenting dance halls. Yin's persuasion was ineffective, and she returned to her mother's home. Chen became even more unscrupulous, recently becoming acquainted with Zhou Lianfang (also known as Xu Shirley), a nineteen-year-old dance girl from Taizhou at the Xianle Dance Hall, and renting a room on the floor of No. 593, Route Lafayette, to cohabit with Zhou, disregarding his wife Yin. Now that Yin has learned of this, she reported it to the French police on the morning of the 28th of last month. Detective Qian Shibao was dispatched to apprehend the adulterers, arresting Chen and Zhou, and seizing soiled clothes and socks, bringing them all to the police station. After investigation, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court that afternoon. The police lawyer prosecuted them for adultery and violating family harmony. The defendants hired lawyers Le Junwei, etc., to defend them. After questioning, the court ordered the defendants to post bail, instructing both parties to settle the matter out of court and reschedule the hearing. All of this has been recorded in this newspaper. Now, because the settlement failed, Judge Li Jinshan presided over a continued hearing at the Eighth Criminal Court yesterday morning, questioning the two defendants. Their testimonies contradicted each other, all in an attempt to evade responsibility. The court also summoned the handling detective to recount the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. With the facts of the case now clear, the court ordered closing arguments. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang argued that the evidence of the defendants' crime was conclusive and requested that they be sentenced according to the law. The defense lawyers of the two defendants then made their arguments. The court then announced the conclusion of the trial, and the court ruled that Chen Zonghui, having a spouse, committed adultery with Zhou Lianfang, and Zhou Lianfang committed adultery with a married person. Each was sentenced to three months' imprisonment. If commuted to a fine, it would be calculated at three yuan per day. Each was granted a two-year suspended sentence, and they remained on their original bail during the appeal period.

### Pu Ziling Quit Smoking Medicine Illegally Published Distributorship Advertisements, Prosecuted for Forgery, Scheduled for Sentencing

Pu Ziling Quit Smoking Medicine Bureau, located at No. 3 Yongxiang Lane, corner of Edward Road and Belle Road, was leased to Hua Fa Company in February of this year to continue operations. The company then conducted extensive publicity, illegally publishing the name of Dalai Company, located at the intersection of Three Horse Road and Southern Henan Road, on its prescription sheets, claiming them as an exclusive distributor. Recently, Dalai Company discovered this and reported it to the French police, claiming that Hua Fa Company had forged its name and affected its reputation. The police, upon receiving the report, dispatched detectives to bring Wu Shiqi, a shareholder and manager of the company, to the police station, and confiscated a bundle of prescription sheets. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court, prosecuted under Article 25 of the Criminal Law for fabricating false information in business matters. Judge Liao Yan presided over the trial. The defendant hired lawyers Wang Heng and Gu Zhulv to defend him, and his testimony was evasive. The court, considering the facts of the case clear, ordered closing arguments and scheduled the sentencing for the 18th. The defendant was ordered to post a 300-yuan bail, and if unable to do so, he would be detained.

### Shooting Incident Occurred at the Huile Palace Gambling Den in Western Shanghai, Caused by an Interpreter Picking a Fight

A shooting incident occurred at the Huile Palace gambling den in Western Shanghai around 2:00 AM yesterday morning. A Taiwanese man named Zhong, who is a Japanese interpreter, was introduced to work at the Huile Palace by the "gambling den supervisor." Recently, Zhong neglected his duties and was reprimanded by "the department," and his dismissal was scheduled for the 15th. Upon learning this, Zhong became extremely angry and wanted to use a gun to snipe the head of the department. However, because Zhong did not have a firearm, he turned to Ma Yushan, the leader of the den, to borrow one, but was unsuccessful. A dispute ensued, followed by a physical altercation. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and Zhong immediately fled into the accounting room. Although the shot did not hit anyone, Ma was severely injured by Zhong and was sent to the hospital for treatment, where his life is in critical condition.

### Pioneering Effort in the Chinese Medical Community: Institute Opened Yesterday

### Old Newspaper, New Copy: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (356) (See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty) Distinguishing Between Wheat Consumption and Illness

In the South, rice is the staple food, and wheat is a minor food; in the North, wheat is the staple food, and millet is a minor food. Below millet are coarse grains, while rice and wheat are the most refined. In ancient times, sacrifices used millet, sorghum, beans, and foxtail millet to suit the suitability of the five soils; and from ancient times to the present, both high and low commonly eat rice and wheat, and the most widely planted crops are rice and wheat. In the region of Yangzhou, the grain is rice, but wheat is also planted occasionally. The fields of the North are not necessarily unsuitable for rice, but because the nine rivers have lost their channels and defenses, the summer is dry and scorching, and there is concern about autumn floods breaching the dikes, all of which hinder the ripening of rice. If wheat is planted, it is harvested in early summer, without worry of this. Therefore, the North now uses wheat as the staple food, and interplants sorghum and millet to supplement the deficiency. Even if sorghum and millet do not grow well, it is not a major problem. In fact, the land beneath the sky is suitable for the growth of all grains, and the people beneath the sky are also suitable for the consumption of all grains. Rice and wheat both have sweet and neutral flavors. Rice harmonizes the middle, while wheat nourishes the middle. The natures of the two are not very different. Today, doctors who do not understand ancient books and do not ask about distant customs often forbid people from eating wheat, and I do not know what they see in this. Do they say that its merit is to benefit qi? Qi is what the body receives. If the body is weak, qi must be insufficient. Wheat can benefit qi, and it is beneficial for diseases of qi deficiency. Why is it not edible? They then say: "Since wheat nourishes the middle, it benefits qi. The power to benefit qi lies in stimulating what the human body's organs receive. Over time, this causes illness; or if there is an existing illness, it is time for it to break out, and the effect of wheat is no different from leading it to the point of eruption. People who are already ill have weak qi. Nourishing what is weak is a wonderful remedy, but there is concern that it cannot nourish and instead aggravates the illness. So it is better not to eat it." They also say: "The earth qi in the North is strong, and people's bodies are solid. Wheat can benefit their qi; the bodies of Southerners are weak, and wheat is suitable for triggering their illnesses."

Education

### Family Education is More Important than School Education

— Zhou Wu

Ordinary people generally believe that the reason for youth crime is poverty, driven by hunger and cold; however, the truth is not entirely so.

Recently, an American film company made a short film that also proves this point. The film narrates a case in which the police authorities in a certain area of the United States cracked a theft case, and the three main culprits arrested were all underage boys, and their families were all well-to-do, living comfortable lives. So, why did they engage in this theft?

The answer the film gives us is: parents did not take good care of their children. They dress their sons warmly, feed them fully, and think they have fulfilled their responsibility. They do not pay attention to what their children do for recreation in their spare time after school. Ideally, parents should accompany their children to spend their spare time, doing some beneficial exercise, games, or conversation. But, unfortunately, most parents treat their children like cats and dogs that are raised, considering it enough to feed and clothe them, thus producing these various bad consequences.

From this, we can know that parents' responsibility to their children is not only in "providing" but also in "education." Poor parents may not be able to make their children live comfortable lives, but they can give their children good family education, which is far more beneficial to their children than wealth.

Although newspapers and magazines often carry news of young people committing crimes because they are forced by poverty, there is no lack of incidents of wealthy children not engaging in proper occupations and going astray. Therefore, poverty is by no means the only reason for youth crime.

Youth is the period when one is most easily infected with bad habits and drifts into evil ways, because young people are mostly inexperienced in the world and have relatively weak judgment. Therefore, when children gradually grow up and are about to come of age, parents should pay attention to their children's actions and provide patient guidance so that the future masters of the country all walk on the bright and righteous path.

In China, especially in today's Shanghai, school education only focuses on imparting knowledge, and the responsibility for teaching how to conduct oneself in the world is left for parents to shoulder themselves.

So I say: Family education is more important than school education.

### Daily Vacation

— Cao Lingyou

Living in this bustling city, life is very stressful. Rushing around, covering oneself in dust, operating and competing, the brain is already tired enough. Furthermore, the surrounding environment is full of various novel stimuli. Everyone at home bears various unnecessary worries and troubles. Under these circumstances, our mental health is taking a big hit!

According to surveys, people in the city are prone to neurasthenia, because our environment is really too bad, but everyone cannot leave the city to go to the countryside to live a life of working at sunrise and resting at sunset due to their occupation. Therefore, we must think of some ways to regulate our tired brains so that they do not fall into a state of mental imbalance.

Because our lives are too stressful, we must develop a calm attitude and prescribe a kind of daily vacation.

The daily vacation does not need a lot of time, ten minutes is fine, twenty minutes is fine. This daily vacation is simply more important than spring break, winter break, and other regular holidays. We must know that hard work will not harm people, only insufficient rest will harm people. The daily vacation is to get a moment of rest in an extremely stressful life.

People who can take advantage of the daily vacation can not only eliminate various mental illnesses, but also increase work efficiency.

The late U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was a person who was good at taking advantage of daily vacations. He found more than ten minutes of time in his extremely busy life to read his favorite collection of poems every day. A young man used the time before and after each meal to play musical instruments, resulting in an additional skill. There was also a young man who used the extra time after lunch to capture various scenes on the street, resulting in becoming a photography expert.

Really, if you are a very busy person, then you need more daily vacations to regulate your tired brain and make it refresh itself!

### The Importance of Autobiography

— Hu Hongji

A few days ago, I was fortunate enough to meet an elder of society. During the ninety-minute meeting, he expressed his lifelong thoughts and views on life. Among them were many surprising and delightful stories, and many materials that could serve as lessons for future generations.

I advised the old gentleman to write down his autobiography. But he humbly said, "I am not a remarkable person, I don't like to self-promote."

I disagree with this. While there are people in the world who use autobiography for self-promotion, not all people who write autobiographies are like this, nor do they necessarily have to be like this. Because everyone only lives once, life is really an adventure, an attempt, an experiment. In the decades of our lives, we have bitterness, sorrow, laughter, tears, sincere regrets, and painful experiences and lessons. There are many mistakes that we are unwilling to make again, and there are many tragedies that we do not want to repeat. In the struggles and struggles of our lives, we have gained many valuable lessons. These lessons are given to us by society, so we should return them to society. We should not hide them like Chinese "ancient secret recipes," causing society to suffer an invisible loss. We should pass on these lessons as a reasonable legacy to our descendants, so that future generations can accept our lessons without cost, avoid the mistakes we have made, and live a better life.

I not only hope that this old gentleman will write down his autobiography, but also hope that everyone who earnestly lives a faithful life will have an autobiography to leave to their descendants.

### Carnegie's Struggle History

— Wen He

Dale Carnegie, the author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People," has already become a world celebrity. His eloquence has made him an excellent speaker. However, his situation in his childhood was not smooth, and his current position is entirely due to his own struggle.

He came from a farming family and studied at a normal school in a small city when he was young. He was determined to become an outstanding person. He knew that he was born very thin and small, and there was no hope of standing out in the sports field. However, under the guidance of his mother, he had a lot of experience in reciting by heart, and he used this strength of his to join the school's debate team. In the first year, he participated in several debate competitions, but he did not fail in any one of them.

He was extremely frustrated. At that time, he went to listen to a lecture by a lecturer at a summer training session. The lecturer looked very wealthy, had a very generous attitude, and had very skilled posture. He talked about the story of a poor rural child, which was very moving and quickly captured the interest of the audience. He said that this child once felt that his future was very bleak, but he never thought that he would one day succeed and become a person admired and admired by everyone. The lecturer talked about the climax of the story, and he said to the audience: "You want to ask, who is this discouraged child? Ladies and gentlemen, the person you are looking at now is him!"

Carnegie was also sitting in the audience listening, and he was enchanted by the lecturer. This lecture was the first time in his life that he heard such an interesting speech; and the story itself was very likely his own story. He still has a deep impression when he thinks about it now, and he said: "I saw this lecturer running around everywhere by train, staying in hotels, and wearing such a dignified white stiff collar; and I knew that he was once a poor country boy like me, and I was confident that I could succeed one day too."

After that lecture, he used a new method to participate in school debates. He also worked hard to recite famous speeches. Every day, he rode a horse to and from the farm to school, and he often gave Lincoln's "Gettysburg Address" and other famous speeches to this horse. He was so fascinated by speech that all the teachers and students in the school immediately recognized him as the best speaker in the school.

After graduating from normal school, he did two businesses and also wanted to become an actor, but he still eventually took the old road of lecturing. When he was twenty-four years old, he contacted the New York YMCA and wanted to borrow their place to run a speech training class. The YMCA agreed to his request, but he said that he wanted to take two dollars for each session, and the YMCA thought that this number was too big. They agreed to a split account method, and they were willing to give Carnegie 80% of the total income. They thought that this number must be very small, but Carnegie was immediately very popular after he started lecturing, and many people were trained. And other YMCAs came to ask him to open a speech training class. Two years later, his weekly income was already 500 US dollars.

The YMCA's speech class laid the foundation for Carnegie's career. The success of "Carnegie Conversation and Communication College" and his "How to Win Friends and Influence People" had already planted the seeds in his youth.

### Words from the Earth's Core

— Lu Anzhi

The average density of the Earth is 5.5, while the average density of the Earth's surface is only 2.5. Therefore, many precious heavy metals, such as red gold, tungsten, and radium, are stored in the Earth's core. If one day humans are able to excavate the metals in the Earth's core as easily as they mine now, the value of gold nuggets will be as low as ordinary stones, and the world's financial market will inevitably undergo a drastic change.

### Accumulate Small Amounts to Make a Large Amount

— Xin Liang

Once, the American oil tycoon Rockefeller borrowed a dime from his secretary to pay for car fare. "Please remember, don't forget this dime." He said.

"Mr. Rockefeller, oh, what does this count as!" The secretary replied. "What does it count as!" Rockefeller suddenly shouted, "A dime is the interest of a dollar for two full years!"

### Wang Yaoqing Recounts Anecdotes About Tan Xinpei

— Yan Wu

The reason why five famous actors are able to become famous must be that they have agile thinking and actions. When I was in the old capital, the old court supplier Wang Yaoqing once said to me: When Tan Da Wang first became famous, there were many people in the industry who were jealous of him, especially a certain bearded actor. One day, the Seventh Prince of a certain Wang Mansion was celebrating the birthday of his wife. Famous actors from the old capital were all summoned to the mansion to perform and offer toasts. Tan Da Wang and the certain bearded actor were also among them. The certain bearded actor thought that the opportunity to make Tan make a fool of himself had arrived, so he begged a certain opera coordinator to arrange for him and Tan Da Wang to be on the same program; and to be able to perform in the same scene. The certain did not know the intention of the certain bearded actor, so he assigned Tan and the certain bearded actor to perform "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats," with Tan Da Wang playing Kongming and the certain bearded actor playing Lu Zijing. When performing the scene where Kongming and Zijing were drinking wine in the boat, the certain bearded actor suddenly asked Tan: "May I ask, sir, there is a white cloud in the sky, I wonder what good or bad fortune it portends?" This was fabricated by the certain bearded actor. There was no such line in the play. He meant to ask this question suddenly, Tan must not be able to answer suddenly, and the audience would definitely boo him. If so, the certain bearded actor's usual jealousy could also be vented a little. Unexpectedly, Tan Da Wang calmly waved his feather fan and replied: "Heaven's secrets cannot be revealed, please come closer." Then he whispered in his ear: "Your ancestors." The certain bearded actor nodded and gestured, saying: "So that's how it is."

### After Seeing "New Mei Luo Xiang"

— Jie

"Mei Luo Xiang" was the first play staged by the China Traveling Troupe after it was allowed to operate. According to Tang Huaiqiu, it was also a play that allowed him to perform excellently. This time, the China Traveling Troupe revived it after "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise," not only because it was likely to be a crowd-pleaser, but also for two other reasons worth knowing.

First: It has already been decided to rename "Mei Luo Xiang" to "New Mei Luo Xiang." In this era, there are countless women with weak wills like Mei Luo. However, when they reach the end of the road to depravity, they can still turn back to the shore, break free from everything, and resolutely seek a bright future dedicated to the country, which is rare. Mei Luo Xiang originally commits suicide, but after encouragement from an old actor, she recreates her life. This can be said to be not Mei Luo Xiang, but Mei Wu Xiang. At the same time, in this play, the playwright emphasizes Ma Ziying's progressive ideas, which is also valuable.

Second: The Mei Luo Xiang we have seen before was performed by Tang Ruoqing, Bai Yang, etc. However, "New Mei Luo Xiang" uses a newcomer, Li Qinglai (who performed in "The True Story of Ah Q"), to play the role of Mei Luo Xiang, and another newcomer, Lan Qing, to play Xiao Chunlan. These are both new attempts by the China Traveling Troupe.

"New Mei Luo Xiang" is still in four acts. Tang Huaiqiu's Bai Senqing, with his cunning and opportunistic demeanor, is indeed the most outstanding character in the entire play. He is particularly able to use subtle actions to highlight the character's personality. The scene where he forces Luo Xiang to write a letter breaking off relations with Ziying is extremely vivid. Standing in the opposite position to Senqing is the progressive youth Ma Ziying. The role of Ziying is played by Shi Wen from "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty." He is resolute and passionate, with a successful performance. Xiao Chunlan is well-integrated. In this moving tragedy, the embellishment of a vain woman like Chunlan, who thinks she is clever, is indispensable. Lan Qing's diligent performance also won the audience's praise. As for the role of Mei Luo Xiang, it is very demanding. She has to express the personality of a woman with a weak will, while her heart is filled with passion and trauma, intertwined with contradictions and confusion. Li Qinglai is able to perform this quite refined and movingly, which is indeed commendable.

The most relaxed scene in the whole play is the first half of the third act. When Xiao Chunlan comes to see Mei Wu Xiang, the dialogue could be shortened to make the emotions more compact. When Bai Senqing appears, the climax gradually rises. The first act alone has a climax (the debate between Ziying and Senqing), which is also rare.

The realism of the characters in the play, the humorous and powerful dialogue, and the magnificent scenery of the third act, if the emotional impact of each act can be further emphasized, it will certainly be one of the successful plays of the China Traveling Troupe.

often took care of her. Whenever Huicong encountered any difficulties, she would often ask him. Thus, their friendship gradually progressed to the stage of love.

Not long ago, Huicong's mother passed away, leaving her an orphan. Although she still had her uncle, Zhang Xiaotian, and other relatives, they were ultimately no match for her own parents. Therefore, finding a home was a matter she urgently needed to resolve. At this time, she felt Wen Kui's intimate comfort, which made her even more devoted. She resolutely decided to cohabit with Wen Kui.

The reporter went backstage to interview both parties about this matter. Huicong seemed to retain the shy nature of a girl, only smiling and refusing to express anything. Wen Kui, however, frankly said: In the past, because the time was not ripe, we kept it a secret from relatives and friends. Now, to avoid all kinds of rumors, and since it's not a secret affair, it's better to make it public formally. I asked him if he would hold a cohabitation ceremony, and he replied straightforwardly: Of course!

Speaking of this, he went on stage to perform. After finishing, Huicong was waiting for him in the dressing room. After removing his makeup, they left the backstage together. Their manner was, of course, very intimate. Although Huicong had suffered two major misfortunes in one year, she felt much comforted by this happy marriage.

### Hua Yun in "Battle of Taiping" is a Mistake for Hua Yun

The play "Battle of Taiping" has been relegated to an opening play for sweep-the-stage laosheng for many years. This time, when Guan Dayuan joined Gengxin, I advised him to perform more plays featuring bearded laosheng because he was slightly short in stature, had an aged complexion, and his voice was more suitable for high pitches than low. I also told him to sing fewer plays involving wearing green clothing and performing acrobatic movements. I had also previously detailed the characteristics of "Battle of Taiping" in the newspaper. Therefore, when he first performed the play, although it only filled about 80% of the seats, the second time he performed it, he even sold more than a hundred seats on the stage. Later, many ticket agents kept asking him to perform this play, wanting to see how he flipped the "rattle drum" when Hua Yun was captured, and how he sang the old tune of the line "Standing here is your lord, General Hua Yun." This is because this kind of flipping and singing is something that general Tan school bearded performers can't do nowadays. Dayuan had been down on his luck for many years, but this time he was very popular, performing for three months with few signs of decline. I think his "Battle of Taiping" can be considered his signature play. Originally, every famous actor should have three or two signature masterpieces, and the advantages of these plays should be well known to the public, so there is no need to worry about not being welcomed. For example, Cheng Yanqiu's "Hongfu Biography" and "June Snow" are always full houses whenever they are performed, which is because these two plays made him famous in the opera world one after another and are known as Cheng school famous plays. The worst thing is when an actor can do everything, but everything is mediocre. I'm afraid it will be difficult to become popular even if they sing a lifetime of plays.
