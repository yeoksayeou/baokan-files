### U.S. Navy Secretary Warns Germany, Italy, and Japan: Confident in Two-Ocean Warfare; States U.S. Navy Prepared to Accept Challenges at Any Time; U.S. Navy Personnel to Increase to Over 240,000

Washington - U.S. Navy Secretary Knox stated in a speech to officers yesterday that if the United States is challenged, the U.S. Navy will meet the challenge on the high seas, and the Army will meet it on the battlefield. When the Army and Navy are engaged, it is your responsibility to defend against traitors and prevent them from stabbing us in the back. At this time, a sufficiently powerful navy must be able to engage the enemy far from our shores and simultaneously defeat them in both oceans. We must now take swift action in a realistic manner to address the issue of conquering Europe and invading England. The exchange of several over-age destroyers for eight British bases has shifted the Atlantic naval operations area 1,000 miles eastward. Patrol bombers and naval vessels operating from these bases can intercept the enemy in the middle of the Atlantic. I recently inspected the Pacific Fleet. I can tell you that it is the strongest and most effective fleet in the world today, and it can fully support America's traditional naval victories. Knox then spoke about the responsibility of the police to prevent sabotage, saying that there are hundreds, even thousands, of saboteurs within the country, and enemies of democracy surround us. He also said that the purpose of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance is aimed at the United States, and the United States has never yielded to intimidation. A test may come in the future, and only God knows whether this test will be on the battlefield or a voluntary one. Fifth column activities may occur, and this must be prevented. We must place secret parties within the country who can harm us in places where they cannot contact outsiders and cannot cause trouble. If the United States is forced to fight, we must be prepared for it. We have never lost a war. We are the biggest obstacle in the process of totalitarianism. If Britain cannot stem the tide of continued advance by the thugs, we will be surrounded by these international thugs. Their greatest victory would be the destruction of the United States.

U.S. Navy Department Orders Call-Up of All Reserve Troops

Washington - U.S. Navy Secretary Knox has ordered the call-up of all reserve troops in the Navy and Marine Corps. A total of over 27,000 people are required to comply with the order. (Reuters, 6th)

Washington - Today, the U.S. Navy has called up all its fleets, both active and reserve, including 33,481 enlisted personnel and 1,610 officers who have already registered. This decision by the Navy to issue the call-up order complements the National Guard mobilization order issued some time ago. The Navy Department stated that the reserve call-up will be completed in the "shortest possible time." These reserve troops will be used to fill gaps in the Navy, and the nation is also paying close attention to "medical" defense. If the Japanese army invades the Dutch East Indies, there will be a panic over the military necessity of quinine. A U.S. Army medical officer said that the nation's quinine supply can only meet one year's consumption during peacetime. (International Telegram, 6th)

Washington - Following U.S. Navy Secretary Knox's warning to the Axis powers' allied nations, the U.S. government issued an order last night to increase the number of reserve troops to 27,000 in order to strengthen naval combat power. If this happens, the number of naval personnel will reach 243,492. (United Press, 6th)

### Roosevelt Delivers Speech: Condemns European Dictatorships

Hyde Park, New York - President Roosevelt delivered a speech here to students yesterday, condemning European dictatorships for depriving young people of the right to obtain full knowledge of world affairs. He said that American youth are not subject to censorship, restrictions, forced labor camps, or military training as enslaved citizens. (Reuters, 6th)

Washington - If President Roosevelt is re-elected, will he join the European war? This question has been widely discussed before, but it only became clear after Roosevelt publicly praised Wallace's astonishing speech. Wallace said that the Republican Party is the appeasement party of America today. Wallace insisted that the United States has no other way to defeat Hitler except by resorting to war. Wallace's speech is a representation of Roosevelt's future policy. Wallace's speech was not made on the spur of the moment, but a premeditated attack on the Republican Party's claim to be a party of peace. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Democratic Party is a pro-war party. The most important question in the upcoming presidential election is the question of war or peace. Will Roosevelt participate in the war after November? Why does he call the Republicans the party of peace? Is he planning to incite public opinion and instigate war with this? But at least it can be regarded as a path to the political strategy of the New Deal movement. (International Telegram, 6th)

New York - The New York World-Telegram published an article by General Johnson today, pointing out that the rumors that Willkie is a character protected by the Axis powers is a tactic of those who support Roosevelt's re-election and can be said to be a cunning election strategy. Recently, the foreign policy of the United States has harmed the political and economic system of the United States. Roosevelt is afraid that people will see through his weaknesses, so he tries to raise other issues to divert the attention of the American people. (Haitong Telegram, 6th)

Hyde Park - President Roosevelt delivered a nationwide radio address last night, explaining the purpose of the New Deal, saying it was to prevent poverty in the United States. The President also said that America's universal education system is the best fortress for democratic countries to resist dictatorships in times of crisis. The President repeatedly stated that the government must always be responsible for ensuring that those who are willing to work but cannot find work are not left to freeze and starve. This speech by the President is sufficient to demonstrate his final attitude towards his third re-election campaign. (United Press, 6th)

Aberdeen, South Dakota - U.S. Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Wallace, after giving campaign speeches in thirteen states over fifteen days, left here last night to return to Washington. It is said that Wallace feels that the general situation is extremely supportive of the New Deal and hopes to win next month and will report this situation to the President. Wallace is the person responsible for the Democratic Party's campaign. President Roosevelt must pay attention to the crises in Europe and the Far East, so he remains in Washington and entrusts campaign affairs to Wallace. One of Wallace's important tools in his campaign policy is to advocate for the support of small businessmen and workers. Wallace said that the New Deal is to protect these businessmen and workers from the encroachments of Wall Street. Wallace also strongly stated that the Democratic Party fundamentally pays attention to agricultural prosperity and recognizes this as an element of protecting democracy against foreign aggression. (United Press, 6th)

New Orleans - The Jacksonville Journal reported that if the spiritual assistance of the entire American people is effective, then we are already involved in the First and Second World Wars, because the dictatorships are becoming bolder and signing new agreements to increase their destructive power, so the hatred of totalism among Americans is also increasing. (Reuters, 6th)

### Newspaper Circles Especially Concerned About the Opening of the Burma Road

Tokyo - The Hochi Shimbun issued a warning today, saying that if Britain and the United States cooperate to reopen the Burma Road on October 17, it will inevitably lead to a world war, because "the current major crisis in the Pacific means that the United States should make every effort to avoid this reckless action." The Chugai Shimbun commented that when Prime Minister Konoe spoke in Kyoto last week, he said that the fate of the Pacific is entirely in the hands of the United States. We attach primary importance to Japan's position in the Far East, and the comments also stated that Konoe's statement that the signing of the Tripartite Pact was to prepare to accept provocations from other countries truly represents the emotions of the entire Japanese nation. (United Press, 6th)

### Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Denies International News Service Report

Tokyo - Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka met with a United Press reporter today and claimed that the statement by an International News Service reporter about a meeting with him was absolutely false. He regarded this as a "reckless act by a certain American reporter." When the reporter asked him to explain the statement attributed to Matsuoka that "if the United States blindly insists on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, we will fight the United States. It is better to destroy the status quo than to maintain it," Matsuoka replied with emotion, "There is really no need to explain this, because someone in a responsible position such as a foreign minister would not have such an argument, and I have never said this. However, since this matter has made it difficult for people to trust me, I will never meet with American reporters again." According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already instructed the ambassador to the United States to protest to the Liberty magazine regarding the malicious anti-Japanese report by the International News Service about the meeting with Matsuoka. (United Press, 6th)

### Soviet Defense Commissioner's Speech: Preparing to Deal with Any Eventuality; States Border Threats Have Not Been Removed; Soviet Union Recalls Military Attaché to Japan, May Be About to Launch Something

Moscow - Soviet Defense Commissioner Timoshenko told graduates of the Army University here yesterday, "The Soviet Union should be prepared to deal with any eventuality, because the threat to our borders has not yet been removed." Addressing the Army University graduates who are about to take office, Timoshenko said, "The Second Imperialist War is surrounding both East and West. You are joining the army at this time. Although the Soviet Union is safe from the scope of the war thanks to Stalin's clever peaceful policies, this cannot be regarded as the removal of the threat to our borders." (United Press, 6th)

Tokyo - Soviet Colonel Gusingo, the military attache at the Soviet Embassy in Japan, has been ordered to return home to report on the signing of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. People here are very concerned about Colonel Gusingo's trip and believe that the Soviet Union may launch something as a result of the three countries' alliance. It is reported that Colonel Gusingo took the Japanese mail ship "Harbin Maru" to Vladivostok and then went to Moscow and is scheduled to return to his post in the middle of next month. (Havas, 5th)

Moscow - A full-scale air raid prevention exercise has been underway in Leningrad since Friday and is still in progress. (Reuters, 6th)

### U.S. and Mexico Organize Joint Defense Committee

Mexico City - Sources say that Mexican Defense Minister General Castro will be making a report on the establishment of a joint defense committee between the United States and Mexico. (Haitong Telegram, 6th)

Washington - According to newspapers here, the U.S. government has now decided to support the newly elected Mexican President General Camacho. Although Washington and Mexico City authorities are remaining silent, both sides have decided to organize a U.S.-Mexico joint defense committee to handle military matters. The United States will ask Mexico to borrow naval and air force bases. (Haitong Telegram, 6th)

### Burma Bans Entry of British Banknotes Except from India

Rangoon - The Governor of Burma has ordered a ban on bringing banknotes from the Bank of England into Burma from any country other than India, unless permitted by the Reserve Bank of India. The Reserve Bank of India has issued a notice in accordance with this ban, allowing ordinary travelers to bring in Bank of England banknotes up to a limit of £10. (Reuters, 6th)

### U.S. Army and Navy Enlistment Limited to Unmarried Men

Washington - A document here states that the U.S. authorities have drafted an order that U.S. Army and Navy enlistment will be temporarily limited to unmarried men. It is said that President Roosevelt will sign this order in the near future, and it is expected to be announced soon. (Haitong Telegram, 6th)

### British Colonies Donate to War Fund

London - The Sudanese government has allocated £100,000 to give to Britain to purchase a squadron of fighter planes to show the Sudanese people's support for the British government and their confidence in British victory. Minister of Aircraft Production Beaverbrook telegraphed the Sudanese government, saying that when the war is won and world peace is restored in the future, we will never forget those who helped us in times of need.

Editorial

### Konoe's Remarks and the United States

Regardless of which country, whether in peacetime or wartime, securing allies is always regarded as a major undertaking. However, gaining allies can sometimes be tantamount to increasing national strength or removing threats, but it can also lead to being thrown into a dangerous abyss and incurring serious consequences. The non-aggression pact established between the Soviet Union and Germany last year is clearly an example of the former, while Japan's conclusion of the Tripartite Pact this time, based on the international reaction in recent days, undoubtedly means taking the unfortunate path of the latter.

This newspaper has discussed the Tripartite Pact and its impact in detail in recent days. One point that should be given special attention is that Germany and Italy have gained practical benefits from this alliance, while Japan has simply increased its burden. Because the main purpose of the alliance is to restrain the United States, under the current international situation, this is Germany and Italy relying on Japan to achieve their goals, and Japan cannot obtain any practical assistance from Germany and Italy. After years of diplomatic isolation, Japan suddenly gained two hot new powers as allies, which may be somewhat comforting in spirit, but the huge price it must pay is precisely equal to the future of the entire nation. Prime Minister Konoe's remarks on two occasions a few days ago have clearly indicated that the conclusion of this alliance has the potential to lead to a U.S.-Japan war. In fact, the content of Konoe's remarks is nothing more than a restatement of the East Asia Monroe Doctrine declaration made by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on May 29. The only difference is that no one echoed Japan's demands at that time, so his attitude was euphemistic and more moderate. This time, Konoe happened to have obtained the German-Italian alliance, so he did not hesitate to intimidate with the threat of war. This alone shows that even if Japan has not gained any practical benefits from the Tripartite Pact, it has increased its vain air and is indulging in new adventurous fantasies. In Konoe's remarks, in addition to demonstrating force, there is also another side of offering inducements; in addition to repelling, there is also another side of showing goodwill. The so-called inducement is the attempt to use the recognition of the United States' leading position in the Western Hemisphere as an exchange condition for the United States' recognition of the "new order" in Asia and Europe. In the original text of the Tripartite Pact, there is no mention of the situation in the Americas, which is obviously done deliberately to leave this gap in order to deal with the needs of the United States. This is sufficient to echo the previous German statement that the American Monroe Doctrine can only be effective if the United States does not interfere in European affairs. Looking back to the beginning of July this year, President Roosevelt authorized Secretary Hull to issue a statement on the Monroe Doctrine. The so-called exchange condition may have been caused by that statement. In fact, even if all the actual measures of the United States are ignored, it is sufficient to prove from Hull's statement itself that the Monroe Doctrine imagined by the United States has absolutely no similarity to the so-called "new order" in Asia and Europe. Since the United States has no aggressive ambitions and does not want to invade or enslave any large or small countries in the same continent, the leadership position that Konoe mentioned can be used by Japan to establish its hegemony in the Far East, but it has no meaning for the United States. The international situation has evolved to the current extent, and yet such superficial suggestions are put forward. This is either deliberately ignoring the fundamental position of the United States or feigning deafness to the firm policy of the United States. According to a United Press Tokyo dispatch on the 5th, after Konoe's remarks were published, there was very little saber-rattling atmosphere in Japanese public opinion. On the contrary, in general, there is hope that the United States can understand Japanese policy, which shows that the reckless war cries are not supported by the Japanese people. However, the understanding between the United States and Japan can never be obtained on the basis of the Tripartite Pact or the "New Order in East Asia." This cannot be achieved by the Japanese side feigning deafness.

Japan's current approach to dealing with the United States is clearly the same strategy as it previously used against Britain. However, even though Britain has wavered several times, the final outcome of its evolution has proved that the concept of maintaining the status quo and the policy of appeasement have both run into obstacles in the Far East. As for the United States, if it had encountered a threat a year ago, it might have caused the isolationists to become more rampant and the U.S. authorities' Far East policy to be restrained. However, recent lessons have been too profound, and everyone has realized that this international crisis cannot be solved by cowardice and evasion. In addition to vigorously expanding armaments and carrying out two-ocean defense, U.S. Navy Secretary Knox made it clear the other day that if the United States encounters a challenge, the U.S. Army and Navy will deal with it on the high seas and on the battlefield. This statement is sufficient to represent the fundamental attitude of the United States in responding to the Tripartite Pact and the various situations caused by the Tripartite Pact.

Clausewitz, the genius theorist of war, said: "War is more on the side of the defender than on the side of the aggressor. Because aggression causes resistance, and resistance makes war possible. The aggressor always loves peace. He hopes to invade our country without bloodshed. However, he will eventually have to prepare for bloodshed, because we want war, and he has to prepare for war." Words are no longer as frightening as they were some time ago. Now that the defender has made sufficient determination and preparation, whether the aggressor's war preparations can meet his desires is still a big question.

Demonstrating force and offering inducements are two-pronged approaches to dealing with the United States, and the answers obtained are all uncertain, as mentioned above. As for repelling and showing goodwill, the target is not limited to one country, and its significance will be analyzed further.

### Xinhua Daily Comments on U.S.-Japan Conflict

Chongqing's Xinhua Daily recently stated that the recent remarks by the Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister are only a kind of intimidation, the purpose of which is to cause President Roosevelt to suffer a defeat in the upcoming election. The newspaper said, "The dispute between the United States and Japan cannot be resolved except by war. However, neither country is fully prepared at the moment. Therefore, we believe that Tokyo's remarks are only a kind of intimidation. The U.S. election period is approaching, and President Roosevelt has obviously gained the support of the U.S. business class. Roosevelt himself is the protagonist of the opposition to the Axis powers. Japan is using the war-fearing mentality of the U.S. business class to intimidate, so that the business class will abandon its support for Roosevelt. This is the real purpose of Konoe and Matsuoka's challenge to the United States. (6th

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation, September 29 to October 5

Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that since this week (September 29 to October 5), the more important of the combat experiences of the Chinese armies on all fronts are as follows:

Shanxi-Henan: The Chinese army in southeastern Shanxi attacked Liaoxian and Yushe south of the Zhengtai Railway. After two days and nights of bloody battles, they recovered Yushe, killing more than 500 Japanese soldiers and capturing several large and small cannons and dozens of light and heavy machine guns. The siege of Japanese troops trapped in Liaoxian is still underway. The Chinese army in southern Shanxi successively attacked various strongholds such as Zhangmao Avenue, Jidu Longzhang, and Jijiapo Beizhuang in recent days. Currently, Zhangmao and Jiemo are both controlled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army in western Shanxi captured Shuangchi Town (west of Lingshi) in three mornings. The Japanese troops retreated to Fenyang. Various strongholds such as Xilincun, Zhuzhaocun, and Beijiacun in the suburbs of Wenxian County in northern Henan have been recovered by the Chinese army. They are now taking advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack on Wenxian County. The Chinese army in eastern Henan has launched attacks on Zhecheng and Huaiyang in recent days and engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese troops in the suburbs of Huaiyang City. The Chinese army successively broke into the north and south passes. The Chinese army in southern Henan has launched attacks on the Xinyang area in recent days, thoroughly destroying Japanese transportation.

Shandong-Jiangsu: The Chinese army in northern Shandong launched attacks on Shanghe, Huimin, Zhanhua, and Jiyang on the 1st and 2nd, wiping out more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers, capturing more than 50 Japanese soldiers, and seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies. The Chinese army in western Shandong entered Gaotang City on the afternoon of the 1st. The Chinese army in northern Jiangsu carried out sweeps against the Japanese army in the area west of Gaoyou and Baoying on the south bank of Hongze Lake. The Chinese army in southern Jiangsu has launched attacks on Jurong, Jintan, Zhenjiang, and other places in recent days. One route forced its way to the suburbs of Jurong, and the other route carried out large-scale destruction on the Jintan-Wujin Highway, killing 300 Japanese officers and soldiers below the rank of battalion commander and seizing a large number of spoils of war. Another route engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army outside the south gate of Zhenjiang and is still launching a fierce attack.

Hubei-Hunan: The Chinese army on the east bank of the Xianghe River in Hubei launched attacks on the Japanese army in the direction of Jingzhong Road, Henglingguan, and Wenjiazui in recent days. The Chinese army on the west bank attacked the Japanese stronghold of Zhujiabu (near the Xianghe River) northeast of Jingmen. The Japanese suffered 600 casualties. The Japanese army in Tongshan, Tongcheng, and other places in southern Hubei repeatedly attacked Jiuling but were defeated by the Chinese army. The Chinese army in northern Hunan destroyed many Japanese troop trains near Yanglousi Station in recent days.

Jiangxi-Anhui: The Japanese troops near Nanchang in Jiangxi Province launched an attack on the vicinity of Xishan on the morning of the 28th. After being met by the Chinese army, they were defeated and retreated. The Japanese troops in Ruichang quickly launched an attack on Minshan in three routes. The Chinese army launched counterattacks on various routes, with elite troops attacking the rear of the Japanese army. After a fierce battle until the morning of the 30th, the Japanese troops were unable to support and retreated. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and extended to the city of Ruichang, launching a siege. More than 2,000 Japanese troops from Bengbu and other places in northern Anhui Province attacked Xuyi. After being severely attacked by the Chinese army, they suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army in central Anhui launched surprise attacks on the Japanese troops in various strongholds in Hexian County in recent days. One unit attacked Jiangzhen, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers. Another unit attacked Xidou in Hexian County, wiping out a large number of Japanese soldiers.

(3) The Japanese troops in Xinhui and Shengang in southern Guangdong Province repeatedly launched harassing attacks on the Chinese army, but suffered heavy casualties and retreated in defeat. Another unit of the Chinese army stormed into Yaoshi on the 2nd and killed a large number of Japanese soldiers. (Telegram, 5th)

### U.S. Impacted by the European War: Agricultural Economic Panic; U.S. Government Intensifies Production Control

Washington – Due to the sacrifices suffered by the United States because of foreign wars, the first loss is that of the cotton and wheat markets. A large surplus of agricultural products is now piling up in most parts of the United States. The victory of the Nazis has blocked the market for these goods. If Britain is defeated, American agricultural products will lose their largest customer. The prevailing discussion in the U.S. Congress is that foreign events of any kind are not related to U.S. interests. It is believed that Germany can conquer the continent and Britain can encounter difficulties and misfortune, but people in Congress think that these events are only theoretically related to the U.S. However, this view is now greatly questioned. The problem comes from a few difficult facts. Take an example to illustrate: Ten million people in the United States rely on cotton for their livelihoods, and normally 60% of U.S. cotton production is exported. Britain is the largest customer of the United States, but the purchases from the continent are also considerable. Up to August 1 of this year, the total amount of cotton purchased from abroad was 6.9 million bales. It seems fortunate that the U.S. industry can consume the equivalent amount. Next year, the U.S. will be able to sell 2 million bales out of a total of 22 million bales. Therefore, by next August, the U.S. may have 15 million bales of cotton in hand, not counting the new cotton. Even if cotton farmers take a year off, there will still be too much cotton left over. As for wheat, the U.S. had a surplus of 280 million bushels last year, and the new wheat is estimated at 760 million bushels. The annual consumption of the United States is only 650 million bushels, so after another year, there will be 380 million bushels of wheat left over. Canada also had a large surplus of wheat last year, and this year's production is very abundant. Canadian wheat can export 100 million bushels each year, but looking at the market's capacity, it can only accommodate 40 million bushels. Therefore, the future of farmers in both countries does not look smooth. In addition, the British fleet continues to blockade the continent, and the market may become even narrower. As for the U.S. fruit growers, 30% to 40% of their harvest is sold overseas, and their gains depend on these markets. The situation of the dried fruit industry is also the same. Britain is a major customer of American agricultural products, but various countries in Europe also occupy an important position. If a large amount of cotton cannot be sold in the future, other methods must be devised to deal with this matter. If the wheat market is lost, measures must also be taken for cotton farmers. The same applies to tobacco planters. As for prices, they have already been affected by the shrinking market and have fallen to the lowest quality level since September 1939. From all aspects, it can be seen that the current need of the United States is to increase production control. This means designing to adjust America's largest industries to adapt to new conditions. Some people hope that trade with Germany after the war can avoid this severe relief, but the Pétain government claims that France will become a purely agricultural country, which is what Germany wants. Germany's plan is to control Europe as an industrial nation, set the purchasing conditions as it sees fit, and adopt methods that are unfavorable to the United States. Germany has also decided to build a Europe that can be as self-sufficient as possible. If Germany conquers Britain, it will be even more unfavorable to American farmers, because once the wishes of the Nazi soldiers are realized, the hope of the United States for a large overseas market for agricultural products will be completely cut off. As a result, American agriculture will be permanently disrupted. This disruption will soon be felt by the business community. (6th International Dispatch)

Rangoon – Thai Prime Minister Sangramjak told reporters that Thailand does not intend to use force to seize the land it demands from Vietnam. An arbitration committee will be organized soon to decide on border issues. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

Bangkok – Thai Defense Minister Colonel Belon gave a speech to 10,000 young soldiers, stating that Thailand is not afraid of war. Thailand's demands are peaceful in nature, but the people are prepared to serve the country. If Thailand is drawn into the vortex of war, the people should make unlimited sacrifices for permanent freedom. He called on young soldiers not to take actions that damage Thailand's honor. (6th Haitong Dispatch)

Bangkok – Thai Prime Minister Singhren made a statement to reporters, asserting the legitimacy of Thailand's territorial claims against Vietnam and Thailand's determination not to use force to achieve these demands. He stated that the land Thailand is requesting previously belonged to Thailand and is still inhabited by Thais. Many of these Thais have returned to Thailand. Thailand's demands are recognized by all countries as legitimate, but France has not expressed its intention to accept the demands or put forward any suggestions. Thailand does not want to use force because the residents of that area are compatriots of the Thai people, and there is no reason to fight among themselves. He continued that Thailand's demands are far-reaching and cannot be resolved in two or three days. Thailand must find a fair solution. If peaceful means cannot achieve this goal, Thailand must continue to work hard. The content of the request is very complicated and must take time, but France also advocates justice and will be able to provide a satisfactory answer. Thailand should wait quietly for this answer.

### Rumor that Axis Powers Have Drafted Winter War Plan Against Britain; Inducing Spain and Portugal to Join Cooperation; North Africa Expected to Become Center of Gravity of War

Rome - Authoritative sources here report that Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini are now submitting plans to Nationalist Spain to assign it a specific task in the Axis powers' winter war against Britain. It is believed that General Franco will announce his intentions in Madrid this week. Authoritative sources claim that the Axis powers' mission for Spain's entry into the European war was delivered to Spanish Interior Minister Suñer yesterday morning by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Circles here last night generally believed that the Axis powers had drafted a plan to allow Spain to cooperate more actively this winter. Some parties have also proposed that General Franco induce Portugal to join the Rome-Berlin Axis. According to information obtained last night, even if Spain maintains its non-belligerent status, the Axis powers hope to establish submarine bases in the Canary Islands and the Madeira Islands to intensify the blockade of Britain and intercept ships from South Africa in the future. Reliable sources also claim that Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini discussed the issue of drawing the Soviet Union and Japan closer together at the Brenner Pass meeting. It is believed that Italy's intensified aid to Britain was also within the most important scope of discussion. The most well-informed sources believe that the Axis powers will take a more severe stance on the United States' continued aid to Britain in the future. It is believed here that the Axis powers are currently preparing to extend the war into the winter, but the Germans frequently mention the imminent landing in Britain. For this reason, it is generally believed here that Germany's attempt to land in Britain is about to be implemented, but it is also unknown. It is believed that whether the landing is successful or not, the Axis powers will concentrate their strength on the Suez Canal. (6th Associated Press Dispatch)

Yugoslav Capital - This newspaper correspondent stationed in Rome reports that with respect to the talks between the two leaders of Germany and Italy yesterday in Brenner Pass, Italian official personnel refused to give opinions. Reportedly, this talk has emphasized the problems of Spain and North Africa, and has not touched on Southeastern Europe. For this reason, it is expected that the North Africa corner will soon become the focus of warfare against Britain. (5th Havas Dispatch)

Vichy - According to diplomatic personnel here last night, it is believed that the results of the meeting between German Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini last week at the Brenner Pass will first affect the Balkans. There is a general consensus here that the reports received, stating that Italian troops concentrated 120,000 troops and 100 tanks on the Greek border, are extremely serious, and that Greek troops are also very active. It is now undisguised that the Axis powers and their allies in the Aegean Sea will inflict a "fatal attack" on Britain. Vichy officials firmly believe that the main consequence of the Brenner Pass meeting is another Axis agreement in the Balkans. It is believed that this agreement is calculated to satisfy Bulgaria's territorial demands and give it an outlet to the Aegean Sea to the south. Italian sources here last night indicated that the decision of the Brenner Pass meeting may be to increase Germany's power in the Mediterranean, especially in Egypt, where Italian troops are clearly unable to make further progress. (6th Associated Press Dispatch)

The New York Times wrote that the meeting of German and Italian dictators at the Brenner Pass was nothing short of announcing to the world that Germany's terror strategy had failed and Hitler's promise of a final victory had not materialized. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

### Troops Gather on the Border; Italian-Greek Relations Tense; Italy to Convene Balkan Conference to Discuss Unresolved Issues

Athens - The rumors that Italian troops, including some heavy artillery, have arrived on the border between Greece and Albania have caused great unease in the Greek capital. Officials stated that the rumors were manufactured by foreign parties. Political observers believe that the Greek government is prepared to set up defenses on the Greek border. 50% of the reservists conscripted in Epirus have reached their posts, and private cars have also been requisitioned. Rumors have been rampant in Athens in recent days, such as the claim that the Italian minister presented an ultimatum to the Greek government yesterday, but this is not the case. (6th Haitong Dispatch)

Hungarian Capital - According to news arriving in the Hungarian capital, Greece has concentrated 150,000 troops on the Albanian border to resist Italy's territorial ambitions. According to news, Greece is now planning to compromise with Bulgaria to jointly deal with the threat from Italy. It is known that the Greek diplomatic delegation has secretly arrived in the Bulgarian capital, planning to offer Bulgaria a corridor to a free port on the Aegean Sea. Greece is clearly seeking to compromise with Bulgaria so as to avoid Bulgaria's threat in the northeast when fighting Italy in the northwest. Political circles believe that Greece is now trying to prevent Bulgaria from demanding all of Thrace. (6th International Dispatch)

Switzerland's capital "Basel News" recently carried a telegram from a correspondent stationed in various countries in the Balkan Peninsula, stating that the capitals of various countries in the Balkan Peninsula generally expect Italy to convene a conference of various countries in the Balkans soon to discuss issues that the Axis powers deem unresolved. However, Italy will only invite Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia to participate in this conference. The theme of the discussion will be the attitudes of Greece and Turkey, because the Axis powers believe that it is urgent to clarify the positions of the two countries. (5th Havas Dispatch)

Athens - The motorcycles and ships requisitioned by the Greek authorities the day before yesterday have already been released, and those that have not yet been returned to their owners are expected to be returned within a day or two. Therefore, the general public believes that the political situation in Greece has gradually eased from high tension. (6th Haitong Dispatch)

### Bulgarian Official Visits Berlin

Bulgarian Capital - Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Bago Yanov departed from here to Berlin yesterday for a visit, scheduled to stay in Germany for a week.

After attending the ceremony, the two ministers will travel to various ports on the Black Sea. (6th Haitong Dispatch)

### Spanish Interior Minister Arrives in Madrid; Satisfactory Results Obtained from Trip to Berlin and Rome

Madrid - Spanish Interior Minister Suñer returned here by plane from Rome yesterday. Spanish dignitaries and the German and Italian ambassadors to Spain welcomed him at the airport. Suñer's visit to Germany and Italy lasted for three weeks. He arrived in Berlin on September 16 and met with Hitler and Ribbentrop several times. Ribbentrop went to Italy on the 18th and met with Mussolini and Ciano. Suñer then visited Belgium and the English Channel coast. Ribbentrop and Suñer both returned to Berlin on the 23rd. Hitler received Suñer again, and Ribbentrop continued to meet with Suñer. All countries attach importance to Suñer's visit. Ciano signed the Three-Power Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan on the 27th. Suñer met with Ciano on that day and left Berlin for Rome fifteen minutes after Ciano departed on the 29th, meeting with Mussolini and Ciano several times. Suñer's visit to Italy lasted longer than planned. He left Rome yesterday morning and arrived here in the afternoon. (6th Haitong Dispatch)

Madrid - According to the Madrid News, Spanish Interior Minister Suñer's visit to Germany and Italy has yielded satisfactory results. Spain has obtained its due position in the international arena. This visit will not only have an impact on the economy, but Spain's foreign policy will also have significant developments. (6th Haitong Dispatch)

### British Military Leaders Study Counter-Offensive Strategies Against Germany; Maintain Advantage at Sea and in the Sky; Optimistic About Future of the War

London - A Reuters military correspondent stated that it is believed that British naval, land, and air force leaders are now planning tactics aimed at invading Germany. The possibility of Germany invading Britain has now been eliminated, and preparations for a large-scale counter-offensive are being considered. However, if Britain wants to attack Germany, it must cross the sea. Then how will it be done? If the attacking army has full advantages at sea and in the sky, enough to form a long bridge and make maritime and aerial transport continuous, then several places in Europe can be attacked. The British army's failure to land in Norway in the past was because it did not consider this principle. Military strategists have learned many lessons from the past, and in future wars, it may not be impossible to attack Austria via the Adriatic Sea or Italy's Trieste. However, this is only one of the many strategies that British naval power allows the British to plan. The freedom of the British to transport troops is what the Axis powers fear most. More than 250,000 troops have been transported from Britain, India, South Africa, Ceylon, and Australia to the Middle East without losing a single person along the way. The situation in the Middle East has changed greatly as a result. No wonder Graziani, commander-in-chief of the Italian army in Libya, is crying out to Rome that a large army is approaching and is difficult to deal with. If the British army attacks Germany in the future, the people of Poland and other countries that have been ravaged will also be eager to try and support the British. The German army will be unable to cope. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

### Japanese Political Commentator Observes the European War; Believes It Will Be Prolonged

Tokyo - Renowned international political writer Mr. Kinoshita disclosed in a recent issue of a certain political magazine that the Anglo-German war will last a long time. Since the outbreak of the European war, most of the predictions made by general politicians and military experts around the world about the progress of the European war have been wrong. I believe that the Anglo-German war will be prolonged. The reason for this can be seen in the Spanish Civil War, that is, the air force cannot capture cities alone. The amazing war record of the German army in Europe is the result of the effective joint use of aircraft and mechanized units. The Strait of Dover is indeed very narrow, but it is still a sea. If ships are not used, the German army cannot fly across it. Hitler may take advantage of the opportunity of rapid action and large numbers to send troops across the strait, like locusts covering the sky. However, with the British light fleet plus 50 new destroyers obtained from the United States, its ability is enough to prevent the advance of German submarines in the middle of the sea. The United States also has a tendency to join the war next spring. If so, the situation will be favorable to the United States. Therefore, judging from the current situation in all aspects, Germany must wage a long-term war against Britain. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

### General Weigand to Go to North Africa; Will Reside in Algiers; Reportedly Already Arrived in Dakar

London. According to a Vichy announcement last night, General Weigand will depart from Vichy for North Africa in the near future to be responsible for unifying the administrative and political affairs of French personnel in various locations in North Africa. According to a Vichy dispatch relayed by the German official news agency in Geneva, General Weigand has chosen Algiers as his residence, instead of Dakar, as previously reported. Weigand will first go to Algiers. The German news agency, citing a Rome dispatch, claims that Weigand has already arrived in Dakar from Tunis. (Reuters, 6th)

### Italian Forces Invading Egypt Launch New Offensive; British Ships Stealthily Attack Italian Islands by Night; Major Libyan Port Subjected to Intense Air Raid

Rome. According to news arriving here, Italian troops have suddenly begun advancing eastward in Egypt, threatening to swiftly implement new actions on all Axis fronts. The Italian High Command here announced today that Italian columns, after two weeks of activity, have launched a rapid offensive, defeating British armored units southeast of Sidi Barrani and penetrating deep into Egypt. Italian military sources claim that Marshal Graziani, currently in Rome, has already resolved all necessary issues for conquering Egypt and seizing the Suez Canal. (International News, 6th)

Alexandria. It was announced here today that a British warship recently stealthily evaded the coastal batteries of the Dodecanese Islands and heavily bombarded the Italian air base on Stampalia.

(International News, 6th)

Cairo. Aircraft from the British Royal Air Force Middle East Command heavily attacked Italian bases within Libya on Friday. According to a communiqué, British planes successfully attacked ships and warehouses in the port of Benghazi, setting a large merchant ship ablaze. Tobruk was also attacked, with several hits on the docks, while concentrations of troops and barracks were heavily attacked with incendiary bombs by central aircraft. (Reuters, 6th)

London. The heaviest ground artillery fire heard here is ample proof that Britain’s anti-aircraft defenses have been augmented by a considerable number of new batteries. German bombing has been reduced to a minimum. As a result, Britain's newest cruisers are equipped with fifteen-inch guns firing shells weighing one ton each, with a range of twenty miles.

Few German aircraft penetrated the inner defenses of the British capital last night and today. Several explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped in central London and the suburbs, but no group of more than three or four German aircraft was able to break through the strengthened anti-aircraft fire. (International News, 6th)

### Germany Denies Troops Fighting in Egypt

Rome. The British claim that German troops are fighting alongside Italian troops in Egypt has been solemnly denied here by officials. The troops fighting in Egypt are purely Italian.

### The Air Blitzkrieg Returns; Swarms of German Aircraft Heavily Attack London Like Locusts; Strengthened British Air Defenses Prevent Penetration of the Central District; British Communiqué Claims 23 German Aircraft Shot Down

London. After several days of relative quiet, the German Air Force has reprised its blitzkrieg tactics, launching a large-scale attack on Britain. Yesterday, throughout the day, large formations of German aircraft, ranging from fifty to hundreds, penetrated the airspace over the southeastern coast. In the evening, waves of high-speed bomber aircraft arrived in the London area. However, the German bombers invading London encountered the most intense anti-aircraft fire of the week. According to a communiqué from the Air Ministry, as of 7:30 PM, at least 23 German aircraft had been destroyed, while British losses amounted to nine fighters. It is reported that four of the airmen are safe. Most of the German aircraft attempting to penetrate London over the southeastern coast were repelled by the formidable British anti-aircraft fire. The drone of the German bombers was drowned out by the roar of the anti-aircraft fire. The sky over London was heavily overcast last night, but illuminated by numerous British searchlights, creating a bright expanse. At one point, three German bombers were spotted by searchlights, and anti-aircraft guns unleashed concentrated fire at the locations indicated by the searchlights, paying particular attention to attacking a bomber that had dropped a large number of incendiary bombs. The sound of gunfire was like thunder, reverberating through the clouds. Observers acknowledged that at certain times last night, the intensity of the anti-aircraft fire was unprecedented since the outbreak of war, and many new types of anti-aircraft guns were seen firing fiercely, resembling a large ring of fire. After midnight, the intensity of the German air raids lessened somewhat, becoming intermittent. This morning, a small number of German aircraft attempted to penetrate central London. Although some incendiary bombs fell in London, most failed to ignite. According to reports up to midnight, German bombs only landed in two areas within the London region, neither of which was central London, which is a testament to the effectiveness of the anti-aircraft fire. During last night's air raid, a woman gave birth to a baby girl in a basement on Fleet Street in London. A policewoman and a caretaker from the upper floors of the building above the basement assisted with the delivery. The clerk managing the basement stated that both mother and daughter are doing well. (United Press, 6th)

Berlin. This morning, large formations of German bombers reappeared over London. Bombers led by Lieutenant Kuhn dropped heavy bombs on armaments factories near London. Boiler rooms exploded, causing heavy losses. German aircraft also dropped mines in British ports. Another German aircraft made a low-level attack on a British convoy, hitting one ship with several bombs, which immediately caught fire and was enveloped in smoke. Last night, a German bomber in eastern England struck a large vessel escorted by a British destroyer. Although the British ship’s anti-aircraft fire was extremely dense, the German aircraft was still able to score a direct hit. (Haitong Telegraph, 6th)

London. Yesterday, German bombers and fighters launched attacks in batches, incessantly throughout the day. As of 11 PM (8 AM Shanghai time this morning), 23 German aircraft had been destroyed, and the British had also lost nine fighters, with four pilots unharmed. According to Air Ministry intelligence, German fighters arrived in formations of fifty or one hundred, attempting to lure British fighters into the air to engage in combat. Small groups of bombers also flew in, their main target perhaps also to lure British aircraft into action. However, each attack was repelled by British anti-aircraft defenses before causing major damage. Several enemy aircraft flew over the coasts of Kent and Sussex. It is reported that bombs fell on several coastal towns, and a small number of bombs also hit the London area, causing very minor material damage. Some houses were destroyed in Hastings and Metway, which were attacked twice, and the number of deaths and injuries in various places was also small. Some bombs fell on the East End and southeastern suburbs of London. A streetcar was hit near a bomb, and it is reported that the streetcar driver was killed and several people injured. A small number of aircraft sneaked into the airspace over central London, but were bombarded by anti-aircraft fire and then driven away by British fighters without dropping any bombs. A working-class area in a town in southeastern England was bombed, killing seven people, including women, adults, and a ten-year-old girl. Another town in the southeast was hit by bombs, causing considerable damage to houses, but only one person was injured. In an aerial battle over Kent and the mouth of the Thames River at noon, 18 Messerschmitt German aircraft had been shot down, and the British had lost only three aircraft. It was later discovered that two Messerschmitt aircraft, one Dornier bomber, and one Henschel army reconnaissance aircraft from Germany, as well as other enemy aircraft, had been destroyed. A Polish squadron shot down eight Messerschmitt German aircraft yesterday, and a Canadian squadron also engaged in fierce aerial combat with enemy aircraft over Kent, shooting down three Messerschmitt aircraft.

Three British aircraft are missing and have not returned. (Reuters, 6th)

London. The British Air Force did not sortie for the past two nights due to bad weather. Last night, it resumed its attack on the German-controlled Channel ports. It is reported that the British aircraft attacked very heavily. From Dunkirk to Boulogne on the French coast, there was a sea of fire. Because the cloud cover was low, the firelight reflected onto the eastern coast of England. According to observers on the cliffs, British aircraft flew across the Channel just as dusk fell. Within minutes, the explosions of bombs could be seen, and it seemed that several places had caught fire. British bombers continued to raid the Channel ports on Friday. (Reuters, 6th)

Berlin. British aircraft attacked Germany from the North Sea, the Netherlands, and Belgium last night, but were repelled by anti-aircraft fire and fighters and failed to penetrate German territory. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

### Dive Bombers and the Modern Air Force; Written by German Major Brünicke; Translated by Wang Jiahua

Dive bombers did not exist during the World War. Now, they occupy an important and indispensable military position in modern air warfare. They are considered one of the most important offensive weapons of the German army, capable of striking the heart of the enemy and disrupting the rear. The method of bombing by dive bombers is different from other "attack" aircraft. General heavy bombers maintain straight and level flight when dropping bombs, while dive bombers suddenly descend from high altitudes, aiming at the target with a bomb sight and releasing the bombs. At the same time, the pilot immediately turns the aircraft upward and climbs into the clouds to avoid anti-aircraft fire. The world first became aware of dive bombers during the Spanish Civil War. During the Polish campaign, dive bombers had already established great merit for the German Air Force, causing panic in the hearts of Germany's enemies and achieving the effect of defeating them without fighting. The unprecedented victory of Germany in this European war depends greatly on the air force. They have repeatedly destroyed enemy warships and transports, and annihilated their forces off the coasts of Norway, England, and France. The strong defensive positions of Belgium and the airfields of France were all destroyed by dive bombers. During the fierce fighting in Belgium, they forced the Allied Belgian, French, and British forces to retreat to Dunkirk. When German dive bombers descend rapidly from high altitudes, they emit a sharp sound that chills the heart, further breaking down the retreating Allied forces. The structure of German dive bombers is that of a single-engine aircraft, capable of bombing fixed targets such as airfields, streets, railways, and bridges, as well as mobile targets such as warships. These bombers can be single-seat or two-seat. The bombs are released by the pilot and have extremely high explosive power. One bomb landing on a road can turn it into a trap, completely disrupting traffic. During the Polish campaign, it derailed an armored train. The pilots of these dive bombers must have strong physiques, because during the dive, the speed is over 375 miles per hour. At that time, they must be clear-headed to identify the target, and their hearts and lungs must be healthy, otherwise their physical strength and spirit cannot support the pressure of the dive. Therefore, new dive bombers are equipped with air brakes that allow the pilot to adjust the speed during the dive. The weapons of dive bombers include machine guns in the front, which can be fired by the pilot. The standard German dive bomber is the "JU 87" model, which has two seats, so a machine gun is also installed in the rear to engage enemy fighters in aerial combat. The seat can rotate. The wings of this bomber are curved, making it easier for the pilot to observe. The three-bladed propeller is powered by an engine with 1,000 horsepower. Germany possesses this superior weapon.

### British Barrage Balloon Drifts to Sweden

Sweden. British barrage balloons drifted to Sweden in a strong wind, breaking many electric wires. The lights in several villages were extinguished, and the electric railway on the west coast was also blocked. The Swedish army has begun to destroy these balloons.

### Perfect British Air Defense Equipment: Impressions Gained from a Visit by Suki Du

Moscow. A TASS correspondent in London, after inspecting British equipment, expressed his opinion that the establishment of this equipment has not solved the problem of defending Britain from night raids. However, one thing is clear: Britain has created an air defense system including anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons, and fighters, which is more impressive than anything the German Air Force has encountered before. During his visit, British officers and soldiers treated him with friendliness, showed him details, and told him about the situation of the officers. It is said that the treatment of the soldiers is far better than during the last World War. (Reuters, 6th)

### Former French Naval Minister Appointed Ambassador to Spain

Vichy. Bitterly, who once served as the French Naval Minister and opposed declaring war on Germany, has now been appointed as the Ambassador to Spain. Baroux, the original Ambassador to Spain, has been transferred to Switzerland to succeed Coulondre's post. According to news from the Swiss capital, French Deputy Prime Minister Laval and German representative Abetz decided to dismiss Coulondre after meeting in Paris. The reason for this is that Coulondre was the Ambassador to Germany at the time of the outbreak of the war and delivered France's declaration of war to the German government, so he was not welcomed by the Germans.

### The United States Actively Prepares for War; Production Advances by Leaps and Bounds; Industry Absorbs Farm Workers; Steel Production Sets New Record

Washington. Informed observers believe that the United States is preparing for war. Political and business experts whom reporters associate with say they expect government spending to increase further, and US production to break all records. Even if Europe calls a truce, or Britain restores itself, the current business reaction is only temporarily suppressed. America's unsettled fate, and the wars in Europe and China, and the elections about to come, are all interlinked, hence the current prosperity in the industrial world, and the consequent reduction in unemployment. In addition, there is the stability of prices, the uncertainty of profits, and the confusion of the stock market, which are also very phenomena that occur together. Government and business leaders expect the current trend in costs to lead to high tax rates, huge debt, and new regulations for running businesses. As far as the current situation is concerned, the most important meaning it contains in the long run is as follows: (1) The policies of American protectionist trade will eventually cause the United States to dominate Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. (2) For military reasons, hundreds of millions of dollars of munitions will be contracted to factories in the central west of the Rocky Mountains, and agricultural areas that lose out in the export market will be transformed into munitions industrial areas due to munitions contracts, and farm workers will be transferred to factories. (3) The National Defense Committee feels that the needs of the United States, relying on Japan, China, and the Dutch East Indies to obtain silk, tungsten, tin, rubber and other materials, are no longer as important as before, because the committee members believe that America's recent synthetic manufacturing is quite satisfactory. As for the rate at which factories receive new orders, it has reached the highest peak in recent years. Steel production has set a new record. Textile factories have all received urgent orders from the expanded US Army. All retail industries are making profits, and those in the industrial center are satisfied. From this, one can gauge the activity in the military field. Military expenditure in the current fiscal year is 5 billion yuan, but in the subsequent five-year period, it will be expanded to 36 billion US dollars, including the cost of armaments. Under the patriotic high tone of government-controlled national defense production, there is actually a faint tone of totalitarianism, but it is masked by the clamor of preparing for war. Most people cannot discern it in their excitement. This kind of control is expected to gradually encroach on private industry. Merchants are now receiving warnings not to hoard goods needed for the national defense process. The government has announced that hoarding will not be tolerated by the government. To meet the needs of industry in 1941, the production of freight cars is also advancing by leaps and bounds, with the number of sales 20% higher than last year. More importantly, the US Defense Committee hopes to manufacture 33,000 aircraft by October of this year, including 14,000 to be sold to Britain and 11,000 fighter aircraft to be used by the US Army. At present, the rate at which the United States manufactures aircraft engines is 2,200 per month, but within ten months it will gradually increase to 3,500. These motors are all concentrated in the Ford, Pratt & Whitney, Curtiss, and Wright factories. In the naval field, in addition to the 58 warships currently in service and the 130 under construction, another 201 will be ordered to achieve the two-ocean policy within three to five years. Orders at the General Motors machine gun factory, the Remington ammunition factory, and the DuPont explosives factory are expanding very rapidly. South America's foreign trade is keeping pace with domestic development. Leather and wool from Argentina, nitrates from Chile, tin from Bolivia, and magnesium from Brazil are flowing in.

### German Military Weekly Report

Berlin. In the week from September 28 to October 5, naval and air battles gradually intensified. The German Air Force continues to adhere to the principles of French military strategist General Vauban, attacking troops and military targets without wasting military ammunition on civilian attacks. German aircraft bombed British seaports, factories, and roads, and attacked airfields in various places. German long-range guns shelled Dover and nearby ports. German aircraft have been very successful in attacking convoys. German aircraft all depart from their bases in Norway and France to fight. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

Berlin. The losses of British merchant ships are increasing day by day, as acknowledged by the British Admiralty. German submarines are operating more conveniently using French seaports as their bases. Lieutenant Commander Soruk's submarine sank 122,500 tons of merchant ships, and another submarine sank 82,000 tons. The British auxiliary cruiser "Highland Patriot" has also been destroyed. The German Air Force sank one armed merchant ship (10,000 tons) and destroyed six other ships, totaling 10,000 tons. A British submarine was sunk by depth charges from a German minesweeper. The British Navy's failure in Dakar has had a significant impact on British prestige. The British battleship "Barham" was hit by the French battleship "Richelieu", and the British battleship "Resolution" was also hit by a French submarine. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

Discussions on the European War (10) (9)

### European and American Espionage Panic

The arrest of Colonel Vielle and his son Reynard, along with the Geneva publisher Mossier, proves that German plainclothes units are also active within Switzerland. Colonel Vielle, leader of the National Front of the Swiss National Socialist faction, is currently held in a prison in the Swiss capital.

As for Mossier, he collected intelligence for Germany in France. Mossier used his correspondents to freely interview in France, supplying intelligence to Colonel Vielle. The international highway near Zurich leading to Germany is rarely monitored, making Zurich an ideal station for relaying intelligence.

The headquarters for German espionage activities are located in the Swiss capital, a place that, like between 1914 and 1918, is a gathering place for diplomats from various countries, neutrals, and belligerents. There have never been so many figures appearing under the guise of "special advisors" as there are now in this small, mountain-ringed capital, where spies from all over Europe are active. One frequent visitor is General Nikolai, who has rented a long-term villa in Zurich. He is a retired German intelligence chief who is said to disagree with Hitler's political views. His specific mission is to maintain contact with French communists, inciting them to launch a peace movement to isolate Britain in a helpless situation.

Guisan, the Commander-in-Chief of the Swiss Army, is also a leader of the National Front. Another prominent figure is Colonel Truber, a military judge. German students in Swiss universities have also been ordered to withdraw.

Yugoslavia is also working hard to prevent the mass entry of National Socialist and Fascist travelers, allowing them to come openly to Yugoslavia in the capital Belgrade and Zagreb under the pretext of visiting the Belgrade Fair. A large number of travelers have now been ordered by the Yugoslav authorities to leave the country within a specified period. The Belgrade Chief of Police has established a special bureau, ordering local residents to report anyone with suspicious behavior. However, many important figures in Yugoslavia are suspected. For example, every move of the young Yugoslav monarch is only known by the police, but soon it is spread around. From this, it can be seen that someone intends to kidnap King Peter of Yugoslavia, and then restore him to the throne as a puppet.

Romania is most closely watched by the National Socialists. Throughout the Balkans, there are tens of thousands of people who, in name, are merchants, counselors, and journalists, but in reality, spend all or part of their time doing espionage work. The young Yugoslav monarch is in danger of being kidnapped, and the new Romanian monarch, Michael, is in a similarly unfavorable situation. The Romanian authorities have conducted house-to-house searches, ordering suspected individuals to leave the country, but tens of thousands of Germans still live secretly in Romania, and these people, as far as is known, have weapons, and many have even refused police searches. What is unknown is whether the Romanian police are strictly enforcing their duties or merely paying lip service.

Recently, a very noteworthy event occurred in the Balkans: several hundred young German workers arrived in Bulgaria by steamboat via the Danube. The mission of this group of young workers, according to their own statements, is to take advantage of their vacation to get a chance to rest. However, according to information obtained by reporters, these workers were transported by thirty ships, with two hundred people per ship, and concentrated in batches within Bulgaria.

Turkey's methods of preventing espionage are more thorough than those of other countries. Spies have fewer opportunities to operate in Turkey than in other countries. Istanbul is the most dangerous place in all of Turkey, and the authorities have searched for a large number of spies among the German expatriates. Recently, there have been 160 foreign café musicians active in Istanbul, 107 of whom are performing women from Hungary.

The internal affairs of espionage in Egypt are slightly different from those in other countries. When the Great War broke out last September, all Germans in Egypt were imprisoned. However, most of them were subsequently released, and many Germans, claiming to be refugees expelled by the National Socialists, were also allowed to enter the country by the Egyptian authorities. However, even more dangerous than the German plainclothes units in Egypt are the 70,000 organized Italian expatriates, under the direction of Fascist spies and under consular protection. Before Italy entered the war, these large numbers of Fascists had already been assigned their respective tasks. The Egyptian authorities are very fearful of these people carrying out internal sabotage work.

Former French Prime Minister Daladier ordered a search of the Soviet Trade Bureau in Paris and discovered an annotated record prepared by the German secret police, thus learning that espionage within France was extremely dangerous. The large-scale searches in Paris uncovered various espionage activities, including National Socialist spies, Fascist spies, and Soviet spies, all without exception. According to Daladier's report, France's "liberalism" and "arrogance" have always been too lenient towards foreigners, allowing spies from various countries to do as they please.

The unbridled chatter in French cafes yields a great deal to those who are attentive to gathering intelligence. This intelligence is generally routed through Rome to Berlin. The fact that Alois Oerbin, the former local news editor of the Paris Times, was bought off shows that Abezz, a confidant spy of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, has taken control of important figures in Paris. This group of German spies is led by Baroness Ennam, who is very beautiful and speaks many foreign languages. She specializes in promoting pro-German films and newspapers in Paris, as well as seeking out and transmitting military intelligence. France has been closely guarding against espionage since the beginning of the war. A large-scale search was once conducted in the lower classes of Paris, and several thousand people were arrested.

The French military vehicle area is isolated from the outside world. People in the military zone are not allowed to make telephone calls or send telegrams, or send letters, and all their actions are monitored. However, there are naturally spies in the military zone. However, according to French authorities, these spies are not a threat if they cannot get information through the cordon. Later, France also confined all German men and unmarried German women between the ages of sixteen and sixty-five in Paris. The appointment of Mantel, a confidant of the late "Tiger Premier" Clemenceau, as the French Minister of the Interior, is enough to prove that France has the greatest determination to eradicate plainclothes units. However, countless foreigners live in the suburbs of Paris, making it very difficult to clear out spies. The biggest difficulty is that non-belligerent expatriates can continue to enjoy various freedoms, and have never been subject to the slightest restraint by the French authorities.

### The Importance and Strategies of Promoting Chinese Stocks

— Wang Haibo

Chinese Stocks and Their Market

A stock is a certificate representing the ownership of investment in a company by a shareholder with limited liability in a joint-stock limited company or joint-stock partnership. Buying and selling stocks is the transfer of this ownership of investment. The origin of Chinese stocks dates back to the First European War. To this day, Chinese businesses that issue stocks include finance, tobacco, matches, printing and paper, insurance, department stores, mining, new medicines, enamelware, and public utilities, chemical industries, etc. In Shanghai alone, there are no fewer than a hundred well-known types. In the third year of the Republic (1914), the Shanghai Stock Brokers Association was established, with its office located at Wo Hing Fang, Jiujiang Road. The initial membership of the association was twelve, later increased to fifteen. Stocks listed for trading included those of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Commercial Bank, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Hanyeping Iron and Coal Company, Hankou Jiji Water and Electricity Company, and the Canton-Hankow Railway. Later, the Chinese Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange also began trading stocks. In June of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic (1937), the securities portion of the Securities and Goods Exchange was merged into the Chinese Securities Exchange, leaving the Chinese Securities Exchange as the only Chinese stock market. Moreover, in practice, although hundreds of types of Chinese stocks have been issued successively, only a few are publicly traded and circulated. The trading of the Chinese Securities Exchange mainly involved government bonds with favorable interest rates; stock trading could not be regarded as equally important. After the August 13th Incident, the Chinese Securities Exchange was ordered to suspend operations, and as a result, the fate of Chinese stocks was even worse than before. Looking back at foreign stocks, speculation was rampant as never before, leading to the outflow of funds and causing turmoil in the financial market, which is truly regrettable. At a time when idle capital is abundant and blind obedience is harmful, is not the reconstruction of the national stock market an urgent task?

Reasons for the Underdevelopment of Chinese Stocks

What are the reasons for the sluggish trading of Chinese stocks? After much deliberation, the author feels compelled to speak out:

(1) Unfavorable General Conditions: Such as China's economic backwardness, underdeveloped industries, and imperfect corporate organization. Although various companies have issued stocks, the capital of most companies is limited, and the issuance of stocks is insufficient for circulation. This is one reason. Before the Xi'an Incident, the domestic political situation was unstable; the general social situation was also constantly changing. As a result, industry and commerce were naturally difficult to develop normally, and the issuance and circulation of Chinese stocks were also restricted. This is another reason. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Chinese industries have suffered direct and indirect destruction, and the situation remains unclear in many respects. All these unfavorable conditions are reasons for the difficulty in developing Chinese stocks.

(2) Weaknesses of the Companies Themselves: The unsound corporate organization in China, with its numerous weaknesses, is an undeniable fact. The most prominent of these are approximately the following five points: (1) Companies are unwilling to disclose their true situation; they deliberately make it difficult for those who inquire about the company's information, causing investors to shy away. (2) As a matter of course, before investing, investors must first analyze the balance sheet and profit and loss statement of the investee company to understand its financial and operational status, in order to compare it with other similar enterprises and companies, thereby clarifying the company's position in the enterprise organization and determining its investment policy. However, in China, most companies, although bearing the name of new enterprises, keep the accounting records that can reflect the company's financial and operational status largely secret; even if some are announced, they are brief and not detailed; and even those numbers are not necessarily the most reliable. (3) Chinese stocks are mostly held by major shareholders; the number circulating in the market is small. Those with good dividends are unwilling to sell them readily; those with meager dividends are difficult to sell. (4) It is often difficult to transfer shares held by shareholders. According to what the author knows, when a certain shareholder once sold a certain type of stock he held, other related shareholders were shocked and even wanted to convene a shareholders' meeting to deal with it. Investors who witness this phenomenon are bound to hesitate. (5) After a shareholder's transaction, if they want to transfer the shares, the company may impose difficulties due to regulations or deliberately create obstacles, making the procedures extremely cumbersome. Even if one is fortunate enough to overcome these difficulties, the transfer of stocks such as those of the Bank of Communications and Sincere Company is still far away in Chongqing and Hong Kong, requiring time to travel back and forth. Moreover, before the transfer is actually carried out, investors still face the possibility of investment risks. The quick and simple transfer of foreign stocks is something that Chinese stocks cannot match.

(3) Investor Hesitations: The hesitations of Chinese people towards investing in Chinese stocks can be discussed in several aspects: such as the inability to fully understand the recent financial and operational status of the companies issuing stocks, and the lack of reliable reports on the dividend situation of the company in recent years; investors naturally dare not rush to buy, this is one reason. Chinese stocks are mostly registered, and transfers must be registered; and the transfer procedures are mostly troublesome and slow; if there is any non-compliance, procedures such as publishing notices in newspapers and providing guarantees are required; this procedure, sometimes for the sake of prudence, is sometimes unnecessary in fact; but Chinese companies mostly follow the routine, which makes investors express fear of stock transactions; this is another reason. This situation is partly due to the unfavorable general social conditions, and partly due to the existence of various weaknesses in the companies themselves. Moreover, the lack of a sound public stock trading market in our country is a major concern for investors.

Examining the so-called securitization of fixed capital in European and American countries, the securities of fixed investments can be traded and circulated through exchanges; investors readily accept these securities because they are transferable, no less so than short-term investments. However, in China, the conditions of the financial market are not yet sound; and there is a lack of a proper stock trading market. As a result, those who hold stocks have no way to sell them; and if they want to mortgage them to financial institutions, they are often rejected. Unable to sell or mortgage, stock holders are in a dilemma, and cannot help but sigh at the uselessness of stocks! This is the situation regarding the supply of stocks. As for the demand side, there is the suffering of not knowing where to inquire. Because supply and demand cannot meet, those who hold stocks, being unable to alleviate their financial difficulties, feel as if they hold worthless items; and investors, wanting to buy, have no way to do so, and are afraid that their funds will be tied up; as a result, they are hesitant to invest in Chinese stocks; thus, social idle capital turns to speculative avenues such as foreign exchange, gold, and foreign stocks; the outflow of funds cannot be stopped; and the market is disrupted, causing even greater harm. Whose fault is this? Who can believe that it has nothing to do with China's lack of a public securities market?

Future Strategies

The securities market and the financial market are closely related; those with financial knowledge all know this. The securities market is the only place to execute securities trading and control the securities market; and the liquidity of securities trading and the rise and fall of securities prices are related to the financial market. Moreover, the government bond market and the stock market are the two cornerstones of the securities market. Now that the underdevelopment of Chinese stock trading is such, and the need for a Chinese stock market is also such, the importance of establishing a Chinese stock market goes without saying. But how can it be established under the current situation in China? This is closely related to guiding idle capital and developing legitimate industry and commerce, and we must consider and contemplate it. Here, based on what I see, I present five points:

(1) General: Regarding the current general situation: the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, and various domestic industries are mostly in a state of contraction in this recessionary atmosphere. Although it is difficult to guarantee that investing in stocks will be absolutely profitable; however, we can take some comfort in the fact that in the current difficult environment, many industries are still developing; matters depend on human effort, and whether investments can be profitable depends largely on the industry itself; if investors have keen eyes, investing in Chinese stocks is practically a sure thing. As we advocate Chinese stocks, we hope that investors can discard their preconceptions, and that Chinese industries are not incapable of making a difference.

(2) The Companies Themselves: The underdevelopment of Chinese stock trading is mostly due to the unsoundness of the companies themselves, as discussed earlier. In the future, companies themselves should improve in the following ways: (1) Strengthen internal organization, such as streamlining personnel and expanding shares, which are among the most notable. Currently, general investors pay little attention to the personnel of the companies they invest in; however, those who are well-versed in investment principles are unwilling to rashly invest in companies with incomplete personnel. Moreover, most Chinese companies have very little capital; the stocks they issue are mostly held by a small number of shareholders and rarely circulate in the market; therefore, this type of organization may consider expanding, welcoming participation from the public, so that everyone can work together. (2) Accounting records are critical; if the company seeks the trust of the outside world, and even to promote the company's stock, it should publicly announce the accounting and annual business situation, so that the outside world can understand the true situation. As for stock transfers, they should be as quick and simple as possible; unnecessary procedures can be omitted. In short: the company itself should strive to be properly adjusted; advantages should be preserved and further promoted; and disadvantages should be improved, striving for perfection. This is not only related to attracting external investment, but also to the company's own development.

(3) Investors: In this situation, investors should also reflect and thoroughly awaken. In recent years, those who have speculated in foreign exchange, gold, and foreign stocks have certainly made a fortune, but those who have lost their fortunes and been involved in lawsuits and imprisonment are also not uncommon. For example, in early June of this year, as the situation in Europe tightened, British stocks fell, foreign exchange rates eased, foreign banks in Shanghai saw bank runs, speculative psychology declined, and the situation in the Dutch East Indies was tense, etc., the prices of foreign stocks plummeted, and it is truly unknown how many people failed due to speculation in foreign stocks. It can be seen that investing in foreign stocks is neither absolutely safe nor absolutely profitable. Investors should now realize and reflect on this. In light of the current international situation, which is volatile and unstable, the movements of foreign companies are constantly changing; the future situation is difficult to predict; and the rubber stock craze of the early Republic is still fresh in memory. If investing in Chinese stocks, one can inquire about the actual situation of the company nearby, and supervision is also easier. This is the second thing that investors should reflect and awaken to. Moreover, investing in foreign stocks is ignorant of national responsibility; while Chinese stocks are treated as if unseen; this is also disheartening. It is not known that Chinese industry is waiting for the Chinese people to revitalize it; and investing in Chinese stocks is not merely helpful to the development of Chinese industry and commerce. As the saying goes: "If the skin is not there, what will the hair cling to?" We earnestly hope that domestic investors will appreciate this, realize it, and change their course!

(4) The Financial Sector: Securities and finance are closely related, so promoting Chinese stocks depends on the financial sector; and the trust industry in the financial sector cannot shirk its responsibility. According to the trust industry: there is trust investment; there is the agency for the transfer and registration of valuable securities; and there are businesses that handle the establishment of companies and the issuance of company bond trusts. All of these are closely related to a proper capital market. However, we cannot bear to speak of the current situation of our country's capital market. Therefore, promoting and popularizing Chinese stocks is not only enough to create a capital market, but also allows the trust industry itself to develop. It only depends on whether our trust industry can rise up and implement it.

(5) Public Opinion: In the current advocacy of Chinese stocks, the public opinion and leaders of various industries bear an important responsibility. The public opinion should introduce more of the inside situation of Chinese companies; and the leaders of various industries should invest more in Chinese industries as a guide. Once powerful people advocate, investors will surely follow; its contribution to the future of the Chinese capital market and national industries is not small.

Currently in Shanghai, everything is developing abnormally; as expressed in the financial market: on the one hand, hundreds of millions of idle capital flood the speculative avenues; on the other hand, legitimate industries related to the fate of the country are unable to develop due to lack of funds. The deeper the gap between these two, the greater the harm to society. Promoting Chinese stocks means on the one hand guiding idle capital to safe avenues, and on the other hand seeking to advance Chinese industry and commerce; and making the two mutually beneficial, mutually enhancing, and bringing endless blessings to society.

The special issue also contains many papers by financial leaders and experts actually engaged in Chinese stock trading, which readers are encouraged to pay special attention to.

### On the Recent Rise in Public Bonds

— Xiao Guanyao

The buying and selling of public bonds in China's financial market has been ongoing for over a decade. With the establishment of the "Shanghai Stock and Commercial Association," members began to formally gather and deal in public bonds. Subsequently, with the opening of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, Shanghai quickly became the center of the securities market.

After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, all exchanges in Shanghai were ordered by the government to cease operations. The public bond market immediately quieted down, and has not yet been officially reopened.

However, after the war shifted inland, under special circumstances in Shanghai, the clamor of public bond trading was once again heard in the securities exchange. However, this type of trading is no longer comparable to the bustling public market of the past, but rather takes place in a "tea house setting." Before long, this "tea house setting" also became a haven for speculators, just like the public market.

So, how did public bonds become an object of speculation? There are many factors involved. I will now select the most obvious and significant ones for analysis below:

First, if we review the pre-war prices of public bonds, the highest price for Unified Bond A was 88.20 yuan and the lowest was 76.60 yuan; Unified Bond B's highest was 86.60 yuan and the lowest was 76.60 yuan; Unified Bond C's highest was 84.80 yuan and the lowest was 74.60 yuan; Unified Bond D's highest was 83.30 yuan and the lowest was 74.00 yuan; and Unified Bond E's highest was 73.40 yuan and the lowest was 71.70 yuan. This is the record for June of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). By January of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), after the Sino-Japanese war had already broken out, their prices had fallen to rock bottom. For example, the lowest price for Unified Bond A was 42.50 yuan, Unified Bond B was 40.20 yuan, Unified Bond C was 39.80 yuan, Unified Bond D was 39.00 yuan, and Unified Bond E was 39.00 yuan. Now that China's resistance war has entered its fourth year, and confidence in victory is growing stronger daily, the current prices are still low. Taking advantage of the low prices to absorb them is not only a good consideration for the banks' reserves, but also a prime opportunity. During this period, speculators also found the demand for public bond chips far exceeding the supply, leading to a continuous rise in prices.

Second, today's large-scale public bond transactions are conducted using bank drafts. Unlike the pre-war practice of cash withdrawals the next day, there is now a discount on drafts. If you exchange legal tender for a bank draft and then purchase public bonds, it is quite economical. It is generally believed that after the war ends, the practice of discounting bank drafts will disappear.

Third, Shanghai is overflowing with idle capital, which is becoming increasingly apparent. In the past three years, Shanghai's wealthy merchants and rich families have already amassed war profits from foreign exchange restrictions, stock market activities, and the hoarding of cotton yarn and daily necessities. Recently, they have started to consider public bonds, because the underground market for public bonds has been quiet for a long time, and the international environment and the situation of the war of resistance seem to favor the prospects of public bonds. Moreover, wealthy merchants and rich families have already made a lot of money in various speculations, and have a considerable economic foundation. Today, they might as well change their tastes and invest in public bonds, and also gain the good reputation of believing in national debt. What's not to like?

Fourth, the optimistic outlook for public bonds is one of the reasons for the rise in prices. Furthermore, public bonds can yield more than one percent interest, which is better than bank deposit rates. Recently, banks have reduced interest rates due to the excess of idle capital in Shanghai, so it is better to increase holdings while public bonds are still low.

Fifth, as public bond prices rise due to increased holdings from all sides, those who borrowed chips to sell short have no choice but to change their tune and cover their short positions, further driving public bond prices higher.

Sixth, and with the recent tensions in Vietnam, which indicate that Japan's southward advance is becoming more urgent, the possibility of conflict between Japan and the United States and Britain in the Pacific is getting closer. Rumors of a meeting between China, the Soviet Union, and the United States to stabilize the situation in the Far East are rampant. Therefore, despite the tensions in Vietnam, the extent of the rise in public bonds has not diminished.

Seventh, the United States' approval of a $25 million loan to China to maintain foreign exchange has been explained by Mr. Jones, director of the American Construction Bank Corporation, and confirmed by officials. This is of great help in international balance of payments. Moreover, the success of the loan reflects the soundness of China's financial credit, its good international standing, and the increasingly favorable prospects for the war. Therefore, people are encouraged, the market is stable, and there is no doubt that the underground market for public bonds is unifying, and various bonds are firmly rising.

For these reasons, it should not be said that the recent public bonds, such as Unified Bond A, which has reached a high of 65.55 yuan, Unified Bond B, which has reached 59.00 yuan, Unified Bond C, which has reached 56.95 yuan, Unified Bond D, which has reached 55.10 yuan, and Unified Bond E, which has reached 56.33 yuan (market prices on September 10), have reached new post-war peaks for no reason.

When we look at the recent rise in public bonds, we can understand how it reflects China's politics, military affairs, economy, and finance.

### Our Country's Wartime Finance

— Yu XieLin

The war of resistance has lasted for more than three years. It is difficult to resist the war and build the country at the same time, and the needs are exceptionally vast, but we can still cope with ease, and the finance is still stable. Is this not because of the transformation of our country's finance? Minister of Finance Kong stated in two articles, "Finance and Finance in the Three Years of the War of Resistance," published on the July 7th anniversary: "In terms of taxation, although there have been improvements in the three years of the War of Resistance, the burden on the general public has not increased; in terms of public debt, the issuance has not exceeded the limit, and credit can still be maintained; in terms of legal tender, the reserves are sufficient and the credit is as stable as ever." The main reasons why we can do this are five: (1) There were appropriate arrangements before the war; (2) wartime measures were appropriate; (3) our country is based on agriculture, and the economic foundation lies in the countryside. In the past three years, there have been consecutive good harvests, which is of great benefit to the people; (4) compatriots at home and abroad have actively donated; (5) friendly countries have shown sympathy and assistance. Based on these reasons, our country's wartime finance can cope with ease.

In the past three years, the financial system has been greatly improved, so that our finance is gradually becoming more rationalized, and the policies that have been decided but not implemented in the past few years can also be implemented in this short period of time. The author will make a brief review of the policies implemented by the financial authorities in the past three years.

Financial Reform Before the War

When the war started, our country's finance was able to respond stably, which was beyond everyone's expectations. This should be attributed to the preparations before the war.

(1) Financial unification had considerable progress before the war. The authorities have made significant achievements in the unification and improvement of financial and administrative powers. Therefore, when the war broke out, the financial authorities were able to cope.

(2) Abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes to cultivate the people's strength. In the past, our country's local tax system was extremely chaotic, with numerous harsh taxes and miscellaneous taxes, and arbitrary extortion was used to seek private gain. This was extremely harmful to the country and the people. Therefore, after the Second National Financial Conference, the authorities actively promoted the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. In the past few years, significant achievements have been made. In this way, on the one hand, the burden on the people has been relieved, and on the other hand, the local wealth has been cultivated, so that the national economy is becoming more prosperous.

(3) Introducing new taxes to meet wartime needs. Our country's taxes are mainly based on the three taxes of customs, salt, and tobacco. However, these indirect taxes are all biased towards the coastal provinces. Once they are lost, tax revenue will have no source. The authorities, seeing this, introduced income tax. Therefore, income tax can continue to be levied during wartime to pay for wartime needs, and the people will not complain about the increase in taxation, because the burden is fair.

(4) Reorganizing public debt and restoring national credit. As for domestic debt, there are many items, different interest rates, and short terms, which increase our country's financial burden, making it difficult to balance our country's budget. Therefore, at the beginning of the 25th year (1936), it was thoroughly reorganized, and more than 30 separate domestic debts were merged into five unified public debts, the terms were extended, and the interest rates were unified, so that the annual financial burden could be reduced by a huge amount. As for foreign debt, it is also actively reorganized. Therefore, in the months before the war, the market prices of domestic and foreign debts all reached satisfactory levels.

(5) Reforming currency to unify the national currency system. The success of currency reform is the greatest achievement of our country's financial authorities. The implementation of the legal tender system can centralize issuance, strengthen banks, stabilize finance, and promote the balance of the national budget. (To be continued)

Commercial News

### Financial Commentary

— Sheng Kaiqiong

—October 5—

According to the Japanese Domei News Agency, American commercial banks will refuse to sell US currency to the public. Although it does not explicitly refer to Japanese merchants, according to financial circles, it is certainly targeting them, as it happened to occur after Germany, Italy, and Japan concluded a military and economic alliance. According to reports, the restrictions imposed by American commercial banks do not apply to spot goods, but to forward contracts. Furthermore, this restriction is not exclusively for Japanese merchants, but is often general. Moreover, this restriction is not a single action taken by American commercial banks, but a joint action taken by other banks.

Although the restriction on forward exchange transactions is not aimed at Japan, its cause is actually due to the changing history of Japan's foreign policy. Because Japan and Germany and Italy have concluded the Tripartite Pact, the foreign commercial banks in Shanghai are deeply concerned that the result of Japan's involvement in the European war may prevent the Shanghai branch of Japanese commercial banks from fulfilling its contractual obligations to other foreign commercial banks, and suffer losses. Therefore, as a precaution, foreign commercial banks that have dealings with Japanese commercial banks want to settle the October forward exchange sold by Japanese commercial banks as soon as possible. According to Shanghai's foreign exchange market practice, October futures transactions can originally be settled by the end of October, but the current international situation is changing daily, and transactions between banks of different nationalities are becoming more and more dangerous. Therefore, for the October foreign exchange sold by Japanese commercial banks, it is of course better to settle it in the shortest possible time.

Because this restriction is entirely to prevent unfavorable changes in the international situation, forward transactions between banks of the same nationality, or forward transactions between banks with the same position, can of course continue as usual without obstruction. Therefore, the Shanghai foreign exchange market is not affected. However, after this restriction is in place, speculative transactions on the market that are not derived from commercial needs will be subject to some restrictions. This is unfavorable to speculators, but it removes some of the disruptive forces from the foreign exchange market, making it beneficial. (End)

### After the Reduction of Interest on Current Accounts, Everyone is Changing to Fixed Deposits, a Good Strategy for Consolidating Idle Capital

Since October 1, commercial banks in the city have implemented a reduction of one percent in the interest rates on current savings and current deposits, that is, from the original four percent to three percent. After the outbreak of the war, various banks converted most of their fixed deposits into current deposits due to the difficulty of using funds, and had long planned to do so. Recently, a large amount of idle capital has flowed in from Hong Kong and other places, and the current deposits of various banks have increased daily. At the same time, the total average daily amount of exchange deposits and interbank deposits in the bank clearinghouse, from 39,154,849.74 yuan in August of the 28th year (1939), increased to 111,094,140.036 yuan in July of this year, and 154,427,650.87 yuan in August, setting a new record for deposits in the association. The amount increased by 115,272,802.13 yuan compared with August of last year. Therefore, the various banks reduced the interest on current accounts, and decided to implement it in advance on October 1. However, before the implementation, the various banks rushed to do night work to send out notices of interest rate reductions to depositors, and sent out the letters before October 1. The interest calculated by the bank for the depositors is still based on December 10 as the date of interest payment. However, the interest rate is for one period from June 21 to September 30, and another period from October 1 to December 20 (calculated according to the interest rate reduction). This is the first time that banks have implemented a reduction in current interest rates, but since the implementation of the reduction in current interest rates, many general depositors have changed from current to fixed deposits after October 1 due to the reduction in current interest rates. Therefore, this reduction in current deposits benefits both banks and depositors. On the bank side, changing from current to fixed deposits can allow a part of the funds to be used, because there were too many current deposits before, and they did not dare to use them. If rumors were to occur, everyone would need to withdraw all of their current deposits immediately. On the depositor side, changing from current deposits to fixed deposits due to the reduction in current interest rates can instead obtain greater interest. Therefore, reducing current interest rates can be said to transfer idle capital to fixed capital, and can also suppress speculative techniques. (Yu)

### Establishing a Far East Policy, America's Large Sum of Money is a Factual Response, Japan's Empty Threats Cannot Help the Situation, Woodrow Wyatt Elaborates on the Consequences of Konoe's Remarks

British well-known commentator Woodrow Wyatt published a commentary in the English-language North China Daily News yesterday, saying that if Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's statement to reporters in Kyoto truly represents his final words, then war between the United States and Japan must be considered unavoidable. Konoe said that the war or peace in the Pacific depends on the extent to which Japan and the United States respect each other's interests in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The United States must express proper understanding and sympathy for Japan's position in the East as a prerequisite for cooperation. If the United States still refuses to do so, and regards the Tripartite Pact as a hostile act, then there is only war. Konoe also said that Japan will induce the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States to end their aid to Chongqing.

Cooperation Between the US and Japan is Impossible

Since Japan announced its plan to build a "New Order in East Asia" and expanded it to a "Greater East Asia," the United States has already expressed its attitude, because the United States understands the intention of this "New Order," so it does not sympathize with it at all. Not only does it not recognize it, but it will do everything in its power to continue to prevent the completion of Japan's plan. Various threats, whether from Japan or any other party, cannot hope to change the United States' Far East policy, make it recognize Japan's "New Order," and cooperate with it in construction. When Konoe refers to "the prerequisite for cooperation," what he refers to is contrary to the United States' policy, so this kind of cooperation is impossible to achieve.

American Policy is Not Subject to Threats

The United States' initial limited "New Order in East Asia" plan was met with the cancellation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation as a concrete expression of opposition. After the publication of Japan's more ambitious "Greater East Asia New Order" plan, what followed was the United States' first serious retaliatory action. If Konoe and his colleagues believe that the empty threats from Tokyo (or Berlin or Rome) are enough to change the United States' basic policy, then their ignorance is also pitiful, because the Roosevelt government or any other American president's government will never adopt a policy that the majority of Americans believe is disloyal to China or disloyal to democratic countries.

Lending Huge Sums to China is a Fact First

All current evidence indicates that the American people and officials have unanimously decided not to cooperate with Japan on its current East Asia policy. As for Japan's desire to induce other countries, including the United States, to "end aid to Chongqing," this attempt has been answered in advance by the $25 million US loan to China a few days ago. Can a clever politician like Konoe really believe that Japan's protests are enough to cancel the United States' guarantee of aid to China?

Japan Dares Not Criticize the Soviet Union

In the past, if Britain and the United States had actions to aid Chongqing, they would be the object of criticism, but there is no mention of Soviet Russia's aid to China. There is indeed an important significance in this. Soviet Russia's aid to China has never been interrupted, even after the Dian-Viet Railway and the Burma Road were blocked, it continued as usual, and the scope of military equipment included is greater than the assistance provided by Britain and the United States. A few days ago, Japan made a statement that it does not oppose the Soviet Union's aid to China. This is indeed an interesting explanation. In fact, although Japan can take advantage of the collapse of France and the troubles of Britain in Europe to take advantage of others' misfortunes, it dares not make any protests to Moscow in order to ask for trouble.

Japan Tries to Reduce Conflicts with the Soviet Union

Japan is enraged even by the goods and livestock that Britain and the United States supply to China that are not military necessities, but it is trying to avoid friction with Soviet Russia with regard to Moscow's continuous supply of military equipment to Chongqing. This is indeed the most powerful confession of Japan's political opportunism. Judging from Konoe's remarks this time, Russia does not seem to need to be considered when discussing the issue of peace and war in the Pacific. Although the recent Tripartite Pact "does not contain the meaning of compromise with communism, it hopes to minimize the sources of conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan." Stalin's policy has always been aimed at creating chaos in the world, while he stays out of the matter. It is certainly not impossible for him to express friendship to both China and Japan at the same time, but if Japan forgets that Soviet Russia may re-present its territorial demands in the Far East if it comes into conflict with Britain and the United States, then it will be clear that it is acting rashly.

### Shanghai Japanese Yarn Factories Suffer From Embargoes, Will Reduce Working Hours Until Raw Materials are Exhausted

Since the Japanese side, by means of special forces, monopolized shipping and blockaded coastal ports, various Chinese merchant factories in the city, due to the lack of continued supply of raw materials and the difficulty of transporting internal sales, were once forced to stop work one after another. Among them, the most affected was the textile industry. Although the main factories in the city have gradually moved to the interior, the yarn and cloth industry, due to the large scale of the factories and the more abundant capital, still rely on Shanghai as the center, and the supply of various inland needs also mostly depends on the city's supply. Later, traffic at various ports was slightly restored after the foreign shipping companies repeatedly negotiated, and the various Chinese merchant yarn factories also resumed day and night work. However, good times did not last long. Recently, various ports have been blockaded again, and transportation has been interrupted as a result. In addition, raw material inventories are about to run out, and it will be forced to reduce working hours again. However, the serious blow suffered by the Japanese yarn factories in the city recently has exceeded that of the Chinese yarn factories. Since the United States' decision to implement an embargo on Japan, the Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai, initially with sufficient raw material inventories, were still able to barely maintain operations. Now, they are gradually showing signs of panic. Because after the Japanese side suffered the embargo, the source of raw materials is scarce, and it is difficult to continue. It is reported that the leaders of the Japanese yarn factories in the city recently exchanged opinions a few days ago, and all agreed that in this difficult period, those who can barely maintain operations should continue to work. They will never stop work until the stored raw materials are exhausted.

### Gunshots in Xujiahui, Japanese Military Police Sniper, Searched Afterwards, Found Nothing

At about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, more than a dozen gunshots suddenly rang out near the Catholic Church in the Xujiahui refugee area. For a time, the residents nearby did not know the truth and were shocked. Afterwards, reporters from the News Agency learned that at that time, a military policeman from the Astronomical Observatory branch of the Miura Military Police Team was ordered to patrol the area on a bicycle. When the military policeman arrived in front of the Xujiahui Church, a man in a black gown suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, pulled out a pistol, and fired at the military policeman. At that time, four shots were fired in succession. One shot hit the military policeman's left arm. After being wounded, the military policeman quickly jumped off the bicycle and fired back. For a time, there was a loud burst of gunfire. Both sides fired more than a dozen shots. When passers-by heard the gunshots, they rushed to escape in shock. As a result, the man who fired the gun did not dare to linger, abandoned the gun in the bamboo fence on the side of the road, and fled without a trace. At that time, the Astronomical Observatory Military Police Corps had already received the news, and urgently sent a large team of military police to the scene to guard and search the area, but found nothing. They then took the wounded Japanese military policeman to the hospital for treatment. The Japanese side is now paying close attention to the case.

### Local Cold Weather Clothing Fundraiser: National Day Universal Donations; Stores and Factories Unanimously Hold Sales; Individuals Also Contribute One Day's Earnings

Since the National Cold Weather Clothing Collection General Association initiated this year's cold weather clothing drive, all parts of the country have responded and promoted it successively. The Shanghai cold weather clothing fundraising is being organized and managed by the Shanghai Committee for Collecting Comfort Funds, and in accordance with the precedent of collecting spring gifts for comforting the troops, the fundraising is being promoted to all sectors, with quotas assigned separately. The Shanghai citizens, living in deep water and scorching fire, are all able to deeply understand the great righteousness and enthusiastically donate. However, the fundraising has been underway for two months, and the funds remitted by various sectors are still insufficient.

National Day Donation Movement

Because the association believes that in the past, Shanghai's various sectors have always been the best in the country for various donations and charitable acts, in order to promote achievements surpassing the national level, in addition to soliciting donations from various industry associations, schools, and organizations, it has also set from National Day to the 17th to promote National Day Cold Weather Clothing Donation Week, hoping that all companies, stores, factories, etc. in the city will take turns to hold charity sales for one week, and strive to implement them universally. As for individuals, the minimum is to contribute one day's income to the cold weather clothing donation. It is hoped that all sectors will uniformly organize at that time, and remit all the proceeds to the bank or newspaper office to be submitted to the central government to express respect, in order to reach one million.

Uniform Regulations and Concerted Efforts

The association's public announcement of the regulations for donating cold weather clothing funds during National Week is as follows: (1) In order to universally solicit donations and increase the amount of cold weather clothing funds, a National Day Cold Weather Clothing Donation Week will be held to make effective universal donations. (2) In addition to the amount of donations promoted by the fundraising association to various industries, it is hoped that compatriots from all walks of life will automatically do their best to donate one day's or several days' income to donate cold weather clothing funds. (3) All large and small companies, stores, and factories, in addition to their responsibilities in various industry associations, are also hoped to hold charity sales for one day or several days to donate cold weather clothing funds. (4) The National Day Cold Weather Clothing Donation Week will be held from the 10th to the 17th, and major companies, stores, and factories may take turns to hold it. (5) All companies, stores, and firms opened by Chinese people should remit all the proceeds from at least one day of charity sales to meet the needs of preparing cold weather clothing.

Voluntary Donations to Fulfill the Mission

It is hoped that the leaders of all sectors and the organizers of industry, commerce, and academia will actively and universally donate voluntarily from the Double Tenth Festival to fulfill the responsibilities of citizens and complete the mission of the times. In addition, the association has been ordered to close on schedule, so in addition to repeatedly sending letters to various public associations, schools, and organizations to urge them, it is also hoped that all sectors will remit them early and not delay them again to avoid delaying the needs of the war of resistance. The receipts, stubs, and fundraising reports provided to all sectors will be recovered and checked after the closure in order to issue awards to various donating organizations and submit them to the government for special commendation as soon as possible.

### Stabilizing Food Prices: Discussions Reach a Conclusion; Foreign Rice Prices and Exchange Rates Drop; Restrictions on Domestic Rice Shipments to Shanghai Gradually Relax

The entire food issue in Shanghai has been gradually stabilizing recently due to the smooth flow of sources and the weakening of public sentiment. According to sources, the authorities of the two concessions have been quite busy recently with repeated consultations on the issue of stabilizing food prices, and will take the same steps to implement them. The results of the consultations have reportedly yielded clues, and the date of implementation is not far off. It is expected that the entire food panic will be solved easily, rice prices at all levels are expected to fall, and speculators will suffer severe blows at lightning speed. It is heard that the authorities of the two concessions, based on past experience, believe that in order to stabilize the rice market, it is first necessary to dredge domestic and foreign rice sources, increase rice inventory, crack down on illegal transactions in the rice market, and strictly stipulate market regulations for the rice business. Therefore, the two authorities will proceed simultaneously on the above points.

Foreign Rice Pricing

Currently, due to the sudden changes in the international situation, the sharp drop in gold prices, and the continued easing of foreign exchange rates, the production price of foreign rice has followed suit, with the transaction price per bag reaching only about 77 yuan. Various parties are taking the opportunity to order in large quantities. According to estimates in the rice industry, the number of rice ordered this time has reached more than 150,000 bags. The huge amount of foreign rice has been loaded onto French postal ships and other ships and shipped to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive in port and enter the warehouse in the middle of this month. It is learned that most of the rice ordered this time is Grade 1 tribute rice. According to the current daily consumption in Shanghai, the foreign rice is sufficient to supply the city for ten days.

Domestic Rice Production

The rice production areas in various parts of the country, including Kunshan, Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Jiujiang, and Jiabi, have improved recently, but the quantity is still limited. Therefore, the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai is not as abundant as before the war. According to news from the rice industry in Shanghai yesterday, once the rice harvest in various places is underway, the amount of domestic rice shipped to Shanghai will continue to increase. In addition, the Rice Evaluation Association reported that within this week, the rice inventory in Shanghai is still about the same as last week. The amount of rice sold in rice shops and stored by citizens is estimated to be about 300,000 bags (because the amount of rice stored in rice shops has increased). Therefore, Shanghai's rice reserves are over one million bags, with extremely abundant inventory.

### Reducing Interest Rates Cannot Eliminate the Crisis; Bank Funds Shift Inward; Maximize the Economic Capacity of Each Bank; Adopt a Conservative Policy for Shanghai

Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai, China & South Sea, Jin Cheng, Continental, Salt Industry, and other banks have successively reduced the interest rates on current deposits. It is learned that this is due to the sharp increase in current deposits in various banks after the war, accounting for 70% of the total deposits, and the lack of corresponding investment channels, resulting in

Excessive funds and difficulty in utilization. In order to avoid wasting interest rates, it is necessary to adopt interest rate reduction measures. Society is divided in its praise and criticism. It is heard that after repeated consideration, various banks believe that reducing current deposit interest rates cannot eliminate the current crisis in the Shanghai banking industry. A solution to the funds should be sought as soon as possible, namely the inward shift of funds. The construction of the interior is developing rapidly and requires funds. The inward shift of funds can complete the

mission of resisting Japanese aggression and building the nation. A conservative policy should be adopted for Shanghai. Industrial and commercial loans should be carefully examined, and loans that would promote hoarding should be rejected. The operation of real estate construction should also be limited, and it should be conducted in accordance with the regulations of the Provisional Measures for Managing Banks, and shall not be directly operated, commercially or by stacking goods, and shall not be operated by the name of an agency department, trade department, or trust department. The direct operation of businesses by bank employees should be strictly prohibited. However, the operation of small money shops, the handling of remittances, discounts, and the trading of gold and silver, which are found to be inconsistent with government laws and regulations, should be effectively sanctioned by the government.

In addition, there were many wreaths sent by industry, commerce, academia, and the press, which cannot be recorded in detail.

### YMCA Collects Winter Clothes for the Poor to Avoid Freezing

The Shanghai YMCA, in view of the fact that every winter, the general poor people in Shanghai suffer from hunger and cold, which is extremely pitiful, has initiated a method of collecting winter clothes for the poor in Shanghai. The draft of the method is excerpted as follows:

Origin

It is found that every winter in Shanghai, there are many poor people, women, and children, crying for hunger and suffering from the threat of death, which is extremely pitiful. It is estimated that this winter, in the midst of this high tide of life, the miserable situation will be even more severe. The Association is planning to collect a large number of cotton clothes and quilts from all sectors of society in advance for cleaning and storage, so that they can be distributed at the height of winter. Although this is a passive relief measure, it is an unparalleled gospel for the women, children, and beggars in the cold wind.

Purpose

Collect: A, 3,000 pieces of old cotton (male) clothing and 3,000 trousers; B, 5,000 pieces of old cotton (female) clothing and 3,000 trousers; C, 10,000 pieces of old cotton (children's) clothing and 5,000 trousers; D, 1,000 old cotton quilts (the above are estimated to be about 30,000 pieces in total); E, other clothing and trousers, men's, women's, and children's shoes and socks, regardless of size or age, are all welcome.

Method

A. The date for receiving clothes is from now until December 1st of this year (a total of one and a half months); B. The place for receiving clothes is the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge (receipts are provided); C. Notice of receiving clothes: If you cannot send them to the Association, you can notify the Association, and we will send someone to pick them up with a receipt; D. Converted into cash: If you are willing to donate cash to help, you can hand it over to the Association to make clothes for distribution. The amount of money is entirely up to your willingness.

Storage

1. A special room will be designated by the Association for storage; 2. After the clothes are received, they will be classified, numbered, registered, and sterilized on a regular basis before being properly stored for distribution at the appointed time. A special person will be responsible for management.

Distribution

According to the number of clothes and quilts collected, clothing vouchers will be printed separately (such as dividing men's and women's clothing, trousers, quilts, shoes, and socks), and the Association's colleagues and volunteers will depart on a regular basis (approximately December 1st to 5th) for distribution. The target must be strictly limited (as follows) to prevent unnecessary recipients from pawning the clothes for money or selling them.

Target

1. Beggars who are homeless and freezing in the streets; 2. Poor women who are homeless and freezing in the streets; 3. Poor children who are wandering the streets and freezing.

### Insufficient Postage: Double the Payment; Effective Today

After the Postal Administration increased postal rates from the 23rd of last month, letters with insufficient postage will be returned to the original sender for re-stamping. This is to be considerate of the public at the beginning of implementation and to encourage compliance.

Insufficient Postage Measures

Double the payment. However, this kind of accommodation method must also have a time limit and cannot be used as an example for a long time. Therefore, the Shanghai Postal Administration has announced that the new postage method will be implemented for two weeks. From today onwards, all mail with insufficient new postage rates will be handled twice as much in accordance with the insufficient postage regulations of the postal regulations. As for the Savings for National Reconstruction issued on the Double Tenth Festival

Commemorative Stamps

According to a reporter from the Daguang News Agency, Shanghai will hardly be able to issue them on schedule because the date is too pressing and the stamps have not been issued yet.

### American Reporter Returns to the United States for Vacation

American journalist Glass. The Stedman couple and the Reich couple, a group of five people, will leave Shanghai for Los Angeles within days. Friends in Shanghai held a farewell dinner for them on the evening of the 5th. Glass is the assistant editor of Millard's Review and also works in the editorial department of The China Press. It is learned that this is a short six-month vacation, and he will return upon its expiration. Mr. Reich came to Shanghai in 1937 and joined The China Press, and was also responsible for the post of correspondent for The New York Times in Shanghai. The Reich couple is highly regarded in Shanghai's press and social circles, and has been in charge of photography at The China Press for five years.

### The Lema Ship Sails to Dinghai; The Taishang Ship Sails to Hong Kong; the Shanghai-Ningbo Journey Arrives After Multiple Transfers

Jardine Matheson's Taishang ship, which returned from Hong Kong, has been here for five days. It was originally intended to sail to Tianjin, but then a telegram came from the Hong Kong head office canceling the northbound flight, so it still sailed to Hong Kong. Also, because the ship was slightly damaged, it has been docked for repairs. It is expected to be repaired this afternoon and sail south tomorrow morning. After arriving in Hong Kong, it will decide what to do based on the situation.

After the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route was cut off, the Shanghai-Dinghai (Dinghai) shipping route is now accessible. It is learned that foreign ships interested in operating on the line are the Lema ship. The ship is approved to sail to Ganlan Island in Dinghai today. From Ganlan Island, it passes through CenGang, Daxie, Chuanshan, Zhenhai, Chaiyi, and ShanBaoZhang, and then takes a sailing ship directly to Ningbo Xinhetou. The total cost of the trip, including the barge fee, is sufficient at 30 yuan. The Lema ship is currently docked on the Bund of the French Concession. After being repaired in the dock by the German ship Haiyi, all repairs have been completed and it will sail to Xiushan.

### French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike: Labor and Management Both Hope for a Quick Resolution; Both Sides Observe That It Can Be Resolved This Week

The French Concession Water and Electricity Company's labor strike has continued to a stalemate until yesterday, and there is no sign of breaking the deadlock. Although the labor side has appealed to the Chinese directors of the Public Works Department, Yu Qiaqing and others, to act as mediators, the points of contention have not been close, making mediation difficult for a while. Yesterday, the labor side stated that the company's general manager, FaFeiLai, greatly agreed with the statement that the labor strike would be resolved this week, because he also believed that the protracted strike could find a solution next week. However, the prerequisite for resolving this strike is that the capital side must answer the six preconditions previously raised by the labor side and dismiss the ticket drivers temporarily hired after the strike. It is also learned that at 9 pm on the 4th, a Western police officer, accompanied by three ticket sellers, went to the home of Shen Zijin, No. 242 ticket seller of the company at No. 20 Xingye Lane, Xujiahui. Just as Shen and his wife were out, the Western police officer took a photo of Shen with him for unknown reasons.

### Robbers Pose as Customers and Rob Expensive Leather Goods; Four Robbers Open a Room at the Yangtze Hotel; They Choose a Large Batch of Leather Goods from Da Jicheng; They Ask for it to Be Delivered to the Hotel but it Is Swept Away and Escaped

At about 2:00 pm yesterday, four robbers went to the Yangtze Hotel on Sanma Road and wanted to open a room. The hotel staff led them to room 430 on the fourth floor. The tea boy brought out a registration book and asked them to sign. One of the robbers wrote the name Zheng Zhen in the book and prepaid 15 yuan for the room.

Purchase of Leather Goods

A little later, two people went out to Da Jicheng Leather Goods Store at No. 347 Henan Road and selected leather goods worth more than 33,000 yuan. After the clerks wrapped them up, one of the robbers suddenly said that he did not have enough money with him and asked the store to send someone to the Yangtze Hotel to get the money. The store staff saw that the two robbers were dressed neatly, like upper-class people, and did not suspect anything else. They sent two staff members, Zhang and Yan, at about 5:00 pm with the leather goods selected by the two robbers to the Yangtze Hotel.

Detaining Employees

Entering the room, one of the robbers locked the door. The two robbers who remained in the room took out pistols and threatened them. The two employees saw the pistols and did not dare to resist. They listened to their instructions. The robbers took out the ropes and cotton that had been prepared in advance, tied the two employees to the chairs, and stuffed their mouths with cotton. The robbers said to them, "Don't make a sound, or we will kill you."

Swept Away and Escaped

After saying that, the four robbers left one after another, locked the door, took the elevator downstairs, and left. Later, the two employees in the room remained silent for a long time. They kicked over the table in the room with their feet. The glass on the table and the teapot fell to the ground. The tea boy was very surprised when he heard the sound and went to knock on the door, but there was no response. He managed to open the door and untied the ropes of the two employees and took the cotton out of their mouths. After asking the reason, he reported it to the accounting room and then to the police station. Detectives were sent to investigate. Later, the two employees were taken to the police station for questioning to facilitate the investigation.

### Truck Causes Disaster: Crushing Death; Overtaking a Car; Shi Xiangsheng Crushed to Death

Shi Xiangsheng, a 19-year-old young man from Pudong who worked for the Japanese-owned Xieji Transport Department at No. 88 Nanjing Road, was riding his bicycle on the Avenue Edward VII on the afternoon of the 5th at about 3:00 pm, heading east to west. When he was near Dongzilaikou Street, a truck F2340 driven by driver Li Jinbiao (45 years old, from Jiangbei, living at No. 267 Junyou Lane, Binlang Road) came speeding from the same direction behind him. Shi's car was in front and did not notice the truck behind him. Li overtook forward, and the driver accidentally knocked Shi's bicycle over. Shi's body fell outward, causing his waist to be crushed by the left rear wheel of the truck, causing extremely serious injuries. He immediately fell unconscious. The police arrived and detained Li and the truck and sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital. Because the injury was critical, he died at 4:00 pm. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall autopsy room and sent detectives to investigate the family of the deceased. Yesterday was a weekly holiday, and the prosecutor's office of the Second Special Court will be requested to send someone to examine the body today. The defendant's negligence was serious, causing a tragic death. The police will also send him to the court for questioning after the autopsy. It is heard that the insurance company will be responsible for compensating for the damage, but the defendant cannot escape criminal liability.

### Female Tea Server Sells Her Sister; Sentenced to One Year and Six Months

Yang Wu, a woman from Shaoxing living in Dean Lane, Pentang Lane, North Fujian Road, had a 21-year-old eldest daughter, Zhu Feng, who recently worked as a female tea server in the gaming hall of the Great World. Between September 16th, she colluded with her lover, Gu A Jin, and sold her 12-year-old sister, A Qun, for 150 yuan through Zhou Yu, an old woman from Suzhou living at No. 164 Yunnan Road, as a goddaughter to a fugitive woman named Wang A Zhen. When the case was discovered, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Public Works Department arrested Yang Zhufeng and Zhou Yu and sent them to the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, said that the elder sister's selling of her younger sister was extremely vicious and requested that she be severely punished. During the adjournment, the buyer, Wang A Zhen, saw the news in the newspaper and, in a hurry, sent the girl A Cui back with an old man. The interrogation of the case was completed and was awaiting judgment. Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the court and sentenced Yang Zhufeng to one year and six months of imprisonment, and Zhou Yu to one year and six months of imprisonment, with a four-year suspended sentence.

### Patrolman Opens Fire to Arrest a Thief: Stray Bullet Injures a Pedestrian

At 5:15 am yesterday, the Central Police Station of the Public Concession sent a Chinese police officer to patrol the Yuanmingyuan Road area. When the police officer arrived there, he saw a petty thief stealing outside a residence. He stepped forward to stop him and tried to arrest him. The thief knew that he was in trouble and ran away. The police officer shouted to stop, but the thief did not listen. He fired a warning shot, firing four shots in a row, but all of them were dodged. As a result, the thief was still captured by the police officer and sent to the police station. When the police officer fired, a stray bullet injured a pedestrian, Dong Qingshan (20 years old), in the leg. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by ambulance.

### Robbers with Guns Wound a Housewife

They fired a shot at her, hitting her arm, and she fell to the ground in pain. The robbers saw that they had caused trouble and fled. Afterwards, the patrolman arrived and summoned an ambulance to send her to Shanghai East Hospital for treatment.

### Tongren Fuyuan Hall Report

The Shanghai Charity Group Tongren Fuyuan Hall reported on its charitable activities in August: a total of 487 yuan and 20 cents were distributed for elderly support, widow relief, poverty alleviation, and orphan relief. 105 adult corpses and 306 children's corpses were collected in Nanshi, and 72 large coffins and 115 small coffins were provided. 194 unclaimed adult corpses and 890 children's corpses were collected in the French Concession Branch Hall.

The Rescue Bureau recovered 49 adult corpses and 18 children's corpses in the Huangpu River. 22 adult corpses and 12-3 children's corpses were collected at the gate, and 45 large coffins and 30 small coffins were provided. 1,535 large and small coffins were buried in the Liuliqiao Cemetery in Pudong.

### Stabilization Fund: Maintains Shanghai's Black Market Exchange Rate; Makes Every Effort to Protect the Interests of Legal Merchants; Supplies Foreign Exchange for Necessary Goods as Much as Possible

Since the establishment of the US$25 million loan between China and the United States, the funds of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee have become more substantial. Now, in order to protect the interests of legal merchants and prevent them from suffering losses in the black market, in addition to fully stabilizing the legal exchange rate, it is also cooperating with British and American banks to maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate and severely crack down on foreign exchange speculation. All kinds of convenience will be given to the import of goods that meet the needs of national and ethnic life. You can apply to the Foreign Exchange Allocation Review Committee for foreign exchange in accordance with the law, and the four banks of China, China, Transportation, and Agriculture will be responsible for it. However, the applicant should first fill in the application form with the name, quantity, price, import, and distribution location of the goods purchased, and submit the supporting documents to the Review Committee for review. However, restrictions must be imposed on imported goods that are not necessary for the war of resistance and goods manufactured in Japan. In short, China will continue to encourage imported goods, such as reducing tariffs on essential goods. As for the import of non-essential goods, it is equivalent to helping the escape of funds and facilitating the Japanese to obtain foreign exchange. The Japanese often transport Japanese goods to the occupied areas, easily obtain legal tender, and then use legal tender to buy foreign exchange. But China does not want to close its doors and still plans to carry out international trade. Regarding Shanghai's foreign exchange black market, since British and American banks stopped selling forward foreign exchange and foreign exchange swaps, speculation will inevitably gradually subside, and the entire foreign exchange black market will be sustainably stabilized.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Fenghua Again

According to reliable information from the aviation industry, at 9:02 am on the 5th, two Japanese planes were discovered again in Xikou, and there were four planes over Fenghua.

Four people were injured, and one bomb landed at two locations in ××. A total of 31 buildings and 19 houses were destroyed, and 10 buildings and 25 houses were damaged. The Japanese planes then swept over Ningbo and invaded Cixi, heading towards Longshan and Guanhaiwei. At 4:20 pm, Ningbo issued the fourth air raid alert. The Japanese planes passed through Lingshan Northeast and Southeast, and after circling in the skies over Yuyao and Ningbo, they scattered absurd leaflets. The planes then turned back from Yuyao to Lingshan and Lihai, and went north through Baiguan. The alert was lifted at 4:54 pm.

### Czech Swindle

A Czech man, Han Liexing Qu, between July 17th and 22nd of this year, while at the Swina Food Company at 119 Nanjing Road, fraudulently claimed to Alice that he had two to three hundred pounds of cream, asking Alice, the owner of the company, to sell it. Alice believed him and stated to Han Liexing Qu that he was willing to buy it, and paid a deposit of 564 yuan. Unexpectedly, after Han Liexing Qu received the money, he disappeared. Alice reported the case to the police. It was not until the other day that it was discovered that Han Liexing Qu was hiding in the Naval YMCA on Sichuan Road. The detectives were ordered to arrest him at that address. Yesterday, he was brought before the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, charged with fraud, and Judge Dai Rongduo presided over the trial. The defendant's testimony was evasive, and the court ordered him to be remanded in custody for a later date, instructing the plaintiff to present evidence for further interrogation.

### Stolen Typewriter

A Russian man, Piroff, residing at the Lani Moore Apartment, 146 Kunshan Road, on the 13th of last month at 8:00 PM, while his neighbor, an Indian man from England named Xu Shi, was asleep, secretly climbed through the window and stole a typewriter worth 2,000 yuan. He entrusted Zhang Xiaomao, the owner of the old goods shop at 175 Zhoujiazui Road, and his partner Qian Ada to find a way to sell the stolen goods. The matter was detected by a Japanese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, who dispatched officers to arrest Piroff and others one by one the other day. Yesterday, they were brought before the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, charged with theft and assisting in the sale of stolen goods. Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the court and interrogated them. The defendant Piroff vehemently denied the theft, while the other two defendants frankly admitted to helping sell the stolen goods. The court concluded the trial, and the defendants were remanded in custody pending judgment.

### Manager of Jingyong Nail Factory Sues Directors for Illegal Actions, Accusing Them of Using Means to Seize Managerial Power. Defendants Deny Illegality, Court Orders Waiting for Judgment

Zhang Shixin from Wuxi, 35 years old this year, previously established Jingyong Machine Nail Factory Co., Ltd. at 6 Longfu Lane, North Zhejiang Road, gathering twenty shareholders with a capital of 20,000 yuan. Zhang himself was a major shareholder, paying up 4,500 yuan in legal tender, accounting for a quarter of the total capital. Therefore, the board of directors organized by the shareholders elected Zhang as the manager of the factory and Zhu Ruilin, a shareholder with a capital of 1,000 yuan, as the chairman of the board. After Zhang took office as manager, he performed his duties diligently in factory affairs, resulting in

annual profits.

The business aspect was quite developed. However, Zhang and the chairman of the factory's board, Zhu Ruilin, and others disagreed. On April 23rd of this year, Zhang was arrested and detained by Zhu Ruilin and others, and the next day, they convened a meeting and removed Zhang from his position as manager, replacing him with Zhu Ruilin and Long Xisheng as co-managers. After Zhang explained the situation of being wronged to the police station and regained his freedom, he was extremely

angered by

Zhu Ruilin and others for using means to seize managerial power. Recently, he commissioned lawyer Dan Yuhua to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment confirming that the resolution of the board meeting convened by Zhu Ruilin and others on April 25th of this year was invalid, and requesting an order for Zhu Ruilin, Long Xisheng, and others to hand over all accounts and for the plaintiff to continue to exercise

managerial authority. His reason was that the defendants Zhu Ruilin and others convened the meeting without a legal quorum (only four out of nine directors were present),

and made decisions arbitrarily.

Moreover, the company's articles of association did not stipulate the term of office for the manager, and the articles of association also stipulated that directors could not send representatives to attend board meetings, claiming that the defendants Zhu Ruilin and others violated as many as eight provisions, requesting a fair judgment according to the law. After the court received the complaint, Judge Mo opened the Second Civil Court the other day to summon them. Both parties commissioned lawyers to appear in court on their behalf. First, the plaintiff Zhang Shixin's representative, lawyer Dan Yuhua, stated

the intention of the lawsuit.

Then, the defendant Zhu Ruilin's representative, lawyer Qian Zheng, detailed that the joint meeting of directors and supervisors convened by the defendant was entirely legal and that there were no illegal acts, requesting the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit. The court questioned both parties in detail for a long time, and after allowing both parties to debate, it announced the conclusion of the case, scheduling the judgment for 3:00 PM on October 11th.

### Letter

To the Editor, We are writing on behalf of our clients, Fei Shuqi and Jin Wenzhi, who have stated that they have recently read in the Xin Shen and Shen Bao newspapers about the owner of the Qiao'anfang houses on Airlike Road disregarding the interests of the residents, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. It has been found that the tenants of the houses have been in arrears for several years. After negotiations between the two parties, the tenants voluntarily moved out, and the houses have been demolished. We are deeply concerned that this will distort the truth and confuse the public. We are writing to you to request that you correct this in order to clarify the facts. This letter is sent on behalf of our clients, hoping that you will grant us space in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Sincerely, Chen Deming, Lawyer, October 6th.

### Football Extravaganza Unfolds: Donghua Wins Both Matches AgainstラックスYesterday, First Team Wins 4-2, Reserve Team Wins 9-0, Li Ning, Liang Shutang, and Others Show Their Former Glory

The annual football season is scheduled to begin next week (12th). The participating teams are preparing their troops and sharpening their weapons. Yesterday, the Donghua Football Field on Lafayette Road staged two exciting preludes, attracting no less than a thousand spectators. Everything in sight was a group of familiar old friends from the football field, all to see the strength of Donghua Team, the only remaining Chinese powerhouse, after half a season of separation. This Chinese force did not disappoint fans' expectations. In addition to the main team winning 4-2, the reserve team also won a landslide victory of 9-0, and the opponent Lux was completely defeated. The battle situation is as follows:

Donghua First Team Defeats Lux

The match between Donghua's main team and Lux's A team took place after the reserve team's match. For Donghua, He Jiatong, Wu Binghao, Zhang Zhaopeng, and Fei Chunhua continued to play, and their endurance was amazing. Dai Linjing, Zhuang Youren, Wan Jin, Cai Shengsen, and other veterans all played. Li Ning, Liang Shutang, and Han Longhai, who were old friends in the past and are now new players, have added a lot of strength to Donghua. Jia Youliang was unable to play due to illness. The performance of the whole team was very good, no less than last year. Their active front line and tight defense were not easy to achieve at the beginning of the season. Li Ning was as strong as ever, and Liang Shutang was also as strong as before. After the start of the game, in less than three minutes, Lux's left defender, Greenburg, fouled in the penalty area. Cai Shengsen took the penalty kick and scored, opening the scoring first. Five minutes later, Lux's right winger, Kepstin, received a pass from Ryan and scored a goal in the goal area, tying the score at one each. The situation became more and more tense. Shortly after, Adai dribbled into the enemy's camp and scored, ending the first half with Donghua leading 2-1. In the second half, the two teams were evenly matched and there was no progress for ten minutes. Dai Linjing was active in the front, and with one kick, the ball flew into the right corner, giving Donghua a 3-1 lead. After fifteen minutes, Kepke Ding came to the former place, Ryan pulled the shot, Zhuang Youren intercepted, and the ball bounced inward. Bi Gao failed to prevent it, and lost another goal, making the score 3-2. The front line was always dull. Donghua launched many attacks, but unfortunately failed to score until the last five minutes, when Fei Chunhua successfully shot while lying down, and Donghua won 4-2.

### Managing the Household with Thrift, Saving Clothes to Aid

— Feng Fangfeng

Ms. Feng Wenfeng is a native of Heshan, Guangdong, and the wife of Mr. Deng Zhonghe, owner of Anle Textile Factory. Her father, Mr. Feng Shihan, is proficient in epigraphy and is a famous scholar in Guangdong. When Ms. Feng was five or six years old, her father taught her calligraphy. For more than twenty years, she has diligently studied and practiced, and has become proficient in various ancient and modern styles. Her official script is considered outstanding for the time. It is said that the key to her wonderful brushwork lies in kneeling with a flat palm and firm hand, deeply understanding the secrets of calligraphy. Therefore, her strokes are vigorous, profound, and simple, completely without any feminine air. She is renowned at home and abroad, which is by no means accidental. Currently, for the sake of disaster relief, she has agreed to the newspaper's request to donate all proceeds from her calligraphy of the word "粥" (congee) from tomorrow until February of next year to aid disaster victims. Those who appreciate Ms. Feng's calligraphy are requested to submit their contributions to the Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Editorial Department of this newspaper for forwarding. -Editor's Note.

Managing the household with thrift is the natural duty of us women, and saving clothing to aid disaster victims is our current responsibility. Now is the season for woolen yarn, so the Shen Bao Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Special Edition on Woolen Yarn is dedicated to promoting it. Having been asked to contribute an article, I believe that we should pay close attention to at least the following points in order to fulfill our duties.

1.  We should try our best to use high-quality domestic woolen yarn, both to cultivate national strength and enrich people's livelihoods, and to educate our children to have patriotic thoughts.

2.  We should knit ourselves, not rely on others, so as to develop thrifty habits, and not waste useful time on useless or improper entertainment.

3.  We should teach our own daughters or sisters to knit themselves, so that they have life skills and do not have a dependent mindset.

4.  We should study new patterns and strive for progress. For example, we can listen to wireless broadcasts about the latest knitting methods for research assistance.

5.  Disasters occur frequently, and refugees fill the roads. If we think of our fellow citizens in distress, inadequately clothed and shivering pitifully, can we not feel moved? We women are charitable and should each examine our wardrobes. If we have old clothes, such as knitted woolen items, we should donate them to the refugees, fulfill our natural duty of human mutual aid, and set a good example for our children.

6.  If we have no spare clothes, we should do our best to economize and donate money to aid disaster relief. This will not only be in line with the principle of managing the household with thrift, but also help solve the problem of keeping warm for the disaster victims. I hope all sisters will rise up together to promote and implement this!

### A Brief History of Woolen Yarn

More than forty years ago, the German firm Quanlong Yangxing was the first to import woolen yarn from its own country, with the Long Brand and Duck Brand. At that time, only women purchased it to tie their hair buns, using it alternately with silk thread. Later, the British firm Lao Gongmao Yangxing also entered this business. Seeing great potential in the future, they set up a factory in Shanghai to manufacture it. Their most famous product was the Beehive Brand (commonly known as Honeycomb Brand) woolen yarn, which was sold throughout the country for a long time without any competition. It was not until 1928 that Chinese people began to set up factories to produce it themselves. Since then, many others have followed, and to date, domestic woolen yarn has achieved amazing success. The quality is no less than that of imported goods, so Chinese people have changed their past habit of exclusively buying foreign goods and have begun to purchase domestic goods. Nowadays, the use of woolen yarn has expanded to a very wide range due to the ever-changing knitting techniques and the economic efficiency of its use. In the future, the prospects of domestic woolen yarn, like the destiny of China, are bright and promising.

### A Collection Spot for Yarn: A Sketch of Xingsheng Street

— Bei Lei

The weather is gradually turning cold, and most people are wearing clothes knitted from yarn. The staff in the many yarn shops on Xingsheng Street are no longer as idle as they were in the summer, but are busy dealing with customers. In the old-fashioned display cases and the new-style display windows, the colorful yarn dazzles passersby, creating a strong temptation for those who wish to add yarn garments to their wardrobe. Take another look at the "model" wearing a knitted yarn coat; its attitude seems quite proud, as if smiling and saying to you, "Why not make yourself warmer and more fashionable?"

Over 90 percent of those who come to buy yarn are women, who arrive in groups of two or three, though there are also quite a few young women who come alone. They look at this, flip through that, chat with each other for a while, and then choose what they love and take it home. Some are buying for their parents, hoping to keep the elderly warmer. Some are knitting something for their husbands, which seems much more intimate than buying something machine-knitted from the market. Some are preparing a gift for their sweetheart, which is truly the perfect gift, and will make the recipient's heart feel happy. Others are buying for themselves, as a beautiful yarn autumn outfit in a fashionable color and style is indispensable for modern women.

Xingsheng Street is located in the eastern district of the French Concession, stretching from Min’guo Road in the south to Gongguan Ma Road in the north. In terms of transportation, all trams heading east from the French Concession pass through here. The No. 2 and No. 9 buses of the Public Concession, as well as the No. 16 and No. 19 trolleybuses, are also very close, just a short walk from the Jiangxi Road terminus. In this short street, yarn shops occupy half of it, numbering over thirty. Some of the shops have very modern storefront designs, having shed their old appearance and giving people a fresh impression. The larger ones all have knitting service departments, employing specialists who teach customers new knitting methods or knit for them, providing convenience and assistance. The service providers are all young women who are enthusiastic and diligent. The knitting experts Ms. Huang Peiying, Ms. Bao Guofang, and Ms. Feng Qiuping have each published specialized books on knitting methods, which those interested in studying can inquire about at the yarn shops. You are sure to find much inspiration for your knitting.

The quality of domestically produced wool yarn has made remarkable progress in recent years, but some customers, due to a lack of understanding, still prefer to buy imported goods at high prices. The shop assistants are very enthusiastic and always try their best to persuade them to buy domestic products. Don't underestimate the shop assistants; the dawn of domestic goods is entrusted to them!

Although several yarn shops have established branches on Avenue Joffre and Jing'an Temple Road for the convenience of customers, Xingsheng Street remains a concentration of yarn shops. Every day, countless women leave their footprints on Xingsheng Street; they are the most common patrons of Xingsheng Street.

### The Once Popular Double Cat Brand Yarn

Among the various yarns on the market, the Double Cat brand is truly an outstanding product, manufactured by the Shanghai Wool Yarn Textile Factory. The factory is large in scale and handles all processes from spinning to dyeing, ensuring bright colors that never fade. It is available in various thicknesses and weights. Since its release, it has been unanimously praised from all quarters. Not only is it sold throughout China, but it is also popular in places such as New York, Boston, Chicago in the United States, British South Africa, the American Philippines, Myanmar, India, Bangkok, and Hong Kong.

### Little Knowledge

— Ms. Shen Jingzhang

Attention Readers of Next Week’s Special Issue on Yarn Knitting

Washing Method for Yarn Clothes: Use lukewarm water (never boiling water) with a small amount of soap powder. After it dissolves, put the yarn clothes into the water and wash gently with your hands, turning them every five minutes. After cleaning, rinse with clean water. Do not wring vigorously; it is better to shake them dry.

Storage Method for Yarn Clothes: When yarn clothes are not needed, expose them to the sun for half an hour, then place four small packets of camphor powder around the four sides of the yarn clothes. Wrap them well with clean white paper and store them in a box.

Ironing Method for Yarn Clothes: First, turn the yarn clothes inside out, then cover them with a piece of white cloth. Then, spray water and iron them flat with an iron.

Yarn Joining Method: Separate the ends of four-strand fine or coarse yarn, and then splice them together. This will make the knot flat and prevent it from unraveling.

Simple Buttonhole Opening Method: Insert your left finger into the place where you want to open a buttonhole on the yarn garment. Use a sewing needle and a thread of the same color, and sew one stitch in each row at the buttonhole. This method is simple and even.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

The day before yesterday, I received a letter forwarded by the editor from Ms. Xi Suheng, in which she praised my economic menu for its contribution to general housewives. I am ashamed to accept such praise. According to Ms. Xi, she knows nothing about cooking, so she is seeking help from me, asking me to designate a location for me to personally teach her, or to introduce her to a school that specializes in Chinese cuisine. Ms. Xi's sincere words in her letter deeply resonated with me, but I am very ashamed to admit that my cooking skills are too ordinary and I am not qualified to be a professor, and I also do not have the time or a suitable location. Speaking of schools that specialize in Chinese cuisine, there are currently none, and I sincerely hope that someone will come forward to open one. As for the art of cooking, it is nothing more than seven methods: pan-frying, stir-frying, braising, stewing, deep-frying, steaming, and mixing. The seasoning must be moderate, not too bland, too salty, too sweet, or too greasy. Compared to the diverse subjects in school, it is ultimately much simpler. I advise Ms. Xi to temporarily inquire among relatives and friends for those who are skilled in cooking and frequently ask them for advice, or to pay attention and observe when her nanny or neighbors are cooking, and within one or two months, she will definitely be able to do it herself. Enough with the small talk, let's look at this week's menu:

Monday

Stir-fried Green Beans with Shredded Pork, Sweet and Sour Fried Beltfish, Shepherd's Purse Tofu Soup, Scallion Shredded Radish

Tuesday

Stir-fried Celery with Shredded Beef, Steamed Croaker, Braised Winter Melon Slices, Stir-fried Cabbage with Rice Noodles

Wednesday

Saturday Tomato Beef Soup, Sweet and Sour Yellow Croaker, Braised Vegetarian Delight, Stir-fried Golden Needle Vegetables

Spring and Autumn

### Shanghai Bank Allocates Funds to Aid University Students

— Wei Sai

Poor students need relief; this is a fact that no one can deny. Recently, there have been several places in Shanghai working to help underprivileged students, but I always feel that their strength is ultimately not great, inevitably a drop in the bucket. Therefore, solving the problem requires the efforts of all parties, especially influential sectors.

The Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank's Social Welfare Subsidy Committee has allocated 100,000 yuan annually since the 29th year to be used as scholarships for outstanding underprivileged students in specialized schools above the vocational level. This great measure is truly worthy of our admiration. What we admire is not just these 100,000 yuan; it is because: perhaps due to its "starting shot," other banks, companies, firms, and major factories, businesses, and organizations will follow suit, forming a trend of considering scholarships as a noble honor.

It subsidizes 400 students each year, each receiving 400 yuan annually. All outstanding underprivileged university students who have been studying at various universities or vocational colleges for more than one year can apply for this scholarship. The application procedure is: students who believe they meet the criteria for being underprivileged and outstanding can apply directly to the school authorities, who will then select the students who are suitable for this scholarship from among the applicants and recommend them to the bank. The number of students that the school should recommend will be notified to the school in advance by the bank. Therefore, the number of students recommended by the school must not exceed the specified number.

If it is a very large university and the number of places is very small, then, according to the bank's regulations, students should be selected from the agricultural, medical, engineering, commercial, and science departments.

What are the criteria for being underprivileged and outstanding? Its regulations also clearly tell us. The criteria for being underprivileged are: (1) The family has no real property income, (2) Parents, elder brothers, uncles, and paternal uncles are unable to help with school and living expenses, (3) Relatives and friends are unable to provide loans. The criteria for being outstanding are: (1) Good health, (2) Good conduct, (3) Relatively excellent grades in all subjects, (4) Rich in patriotic thought, (5) Rich in the spirit of service.

### The Yin (Lunar) Calendar and the Nong (Agricultural) Calendar

— Ti Lu

Nowadays, the term "nong li" (agricultural calendar) is often used to refer to the yin li (lunar calendar) on invitation cards and calendars. The originator probably thought that the yin calendar was convenient for agriculture, hence this term. The yin calendar has been used in China for a long time, and farmers are accustomed to it, so it is not easy to change it suddenly. This is a fact, but to say that this calendar is convenient for agriculture is the opposite of the truth.

The yin calendar takes one lunar cycle as a month. The moon is called taiyin (great yin), hence it is called the yin calendar. The yang calendar takes one revolution of the earth around the sun as a year. The sun is called taiyang (great yang), hence it is called the yang calendar. The so-called twenty-four solar terms are originally intended to indicate the cold and heat of the seasons. They also take one revolution of the earth around the sun as the beginning and end, which is in line with the yang calendar. Therefore, each solar term has a fixed month and day in the yang calendar, and even if there is a difference, it is only one day. It is not like the yin calendar, where the dates differ so much that they can be almost a month apart. Now, I will list the yang calendar months and days of the twenty-four solar terms below:

Minor Cold January 5th or 6th

Major Cold January 20th or 21st

Start of Spring February 4th or 5th

Rain Water February 19th or 20th

Awakening of Insects March 6th or 7th

Vernal Equinox March 21st or 22nd

Pure Brightness April 5th or 6th

Grain Rain April 20th or 21st

Start of Summer May 6th or 7th

Grain Full May 21st or 22nd

Grain in Ear June 6th or 7th

Summer Solstice June 22nd

Minor Heat July 7th or 8th

Major Heat July 23rd or 24th

Start of Autumn August 8th or 9th

Limit of Heat August 23rd or 24th

White Dew September 8th or 9th

Autumnal Equinox September 23rd or 24th

Cold Dew October 8th or 9th

Frost's Descent October 24th

Start of Winter November 7th or 8th

Minor Snow November 22nd or 23rd

Major Snow December 7th or 8th

Winter Solstice December 22nd or 23rd

The earth's revolution around the sun takes 365.2422 days. The beginning and end of the twenty-four solar terms, of course, also take 365.2422 days. However, a year in the yang calendar cannot have a fraction of a day, only 365 days. The remaining 0.2422 days accumulate to almost one day every four years, so the solar terms have a difference of one day. When it is necessary to have a leap year, one leap day is added at the end of February, that is, an additional 29th day is added, which roughly eliminates the accumulated sum of the remaining 0.2422 days each year, and the solar terms return to their original days. As for the yin calendar, its principle is to take the period from Start of Spring to Start of Spring as a year, which is also one revolution of the earth around the sun. However, its calculation of months is based on the lunar cycle, with each month being 30 days for a large month and 29 days for a small month. Therefore, a year of twelve months is only about 354 days, which is at least ten days less than the 365.2422 days of the earth's revolution around the sun. Statistically, a leap month must be added every three years to correct the cold and heat. Therefore, the solar terms in the yin calendar do not have fixed months and days. Taking the Start of Spring as an example, it can be as late as the fifteenth day of the first month or as early as the sixteenth day of the twelfth month of the previous year. Compared to the yang calendar, where the months and days differ by no more than one day, the difference in the months and days of the yin calendar can be said to be great.

Farmers rely on the solar terms for farming, following the seasonal weather. If the yang calendar is used, one can know the arrival of a certain solar term from the month and day, rather than just remembering the unreliable months and days of the yin calendar and having to consult the almanac. Unfortunately, Chinese farmers still do not know the close relationship between the yang calendar and the solar terms, so they are still unwilling to abandon the yin calendar. As for the benefits of convenience for agriculture, only the yang calendar has them. Therefore, the term "nong li" (agricultural calendar) should be applied to the yang calendar; using it to refer to the yin calendar obscures the truth.

Hawthorne's Investigation

### The Whereabouts of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Eight: Two People Arrested

Yu Gantang nodded and replied, "Okay. Li Lan has always loved me, and I love her! ——"

At this moment, I suddenly felt a sentence that I couldn't hold back, rising from the bottom of my heart, breaking through my throat and spitting it out. "Love you? Love her? What kind of love is this? What you study in college is probably a specialty in love. Is this the new philosophy of love you created!"

Yu Gantang only glanced at me, did not have the courage to look at me, and then lowered his head in silence.

Hawthorne smiled and said, "This is originally not considered love. But now, in order to clarify the case, we have to let the word 'love' be insulted for a while. Brother Gantang, continue."

When Yu Gantang continued to speak, his voice was much weaker, and he was also trying his best to avoid the word "love." He said, "We were originally very good with each other, but because of this Zhao Boxiong, she became indifferent to me. Whenever I asked her to go out, she always used false excuses to decline. Because once I asked her to go to the movies, she said she had a headache and wouldn't go, but later I saw her with Zhao Boxiong at the movie theater. Later, I ran into this Zhao at her house, and we had an argument. I once followed this guy's tracks and learned that he lived at 774 Yadong. On the seventeenth day, a friend told me that he saw Li Lan go to 774 Yadong on the night before. After I went to the hotel to investigate on the seventeenth night, it was indeed true. Yesterday morning, I called Li Lan to ask, and she honestly admitted it. I did say a few threatening words to her. Everything that the police officer from the police station, that Mr. Ni, said about my actions is indeed true, and I don't need to deny it. However, as for Li Lan, I just wanted to scare her a little, to make her break off with that Zhao. I absolutely did not mean to beat her to death — this is absolutely not true, because I know that although she is so romantic, her heart is still — still — belongs to me."

Hawthorne had a smile on the corner of his lips, as if he was laughing at him for avoiding the word "love," and he was indeed using twelve points of strength. He still asked lightly, "Since you didn't mean to beat her to death, why did you borrow a gun from your friend Song Zhaoji?"

Yu Gantang hurriedly replied, "This wasn't to beat Li Lan. To be honest, I wanted to settle the score with that Zhao. I went to his house to inquire, also because of him. I feel that my strength and his strength cannot coexist!" (129)
