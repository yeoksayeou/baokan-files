Lanzhou: After Wuyuan was recaptured by Chinese forces, Japanese troops have been continuously arriving from Baotou, Guihua, and other places, passing through Anbei to the vicinity of Dacai Zhucun (east of Zhegui Township) on the north bank of the Wujia River, attempting to cross the river to launch a counterattack against the Chinese forces. On the morning of the 24th, they transported many rubber boats, a unit of engineers, and a large amount of bridging equipment, and dismantled civilian houses near Zhegui Township (north of Wuyuan) to obtain wood to build pontoon bridges. At noon, a unit of Chinese forces launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops, and after three hours of fierce fighting, more than 300 Japanese troops were annihilated. Until late at night, taking advantage of the dim moonlight, the Japanese troops launched four successive forced crossings to the east and west of Dacai Zhucun, but were all met with a painful counterattack by the Chinese forces. Many Japanese troops were killed or drowned, and they ultimately failed. At noon on the 25th, the Japanese troops were reinforced by more than 3,000 infantry from Baotou and Suiyuan, with 12 artillery pieces, more than 300 vehicles, and five aircraft.

### Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Firmly Believe that the Motherland's Resistance Will Be Victorious - Remarks by Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the Fundraising Committee

Chongqing: Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the General Fundraising Committee of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and Zhuang Xiyan, Vice Chairman, arrived in Chongqing by plane yesterday. Reporters visited them again that evening and inquired about the itinerary and tasks of the慰勞団. Chen answered in detail, stating that a group of more than 50 members of the overseas Chinese慰勞団 set off from Singapore on the 6th and will gather in Chongqing in early April to visit the wartime capital and then go to various war zones to comfort the troops and compatriots. They had previously held a meeting in Singapore to discuss various related issues and unanimously agreed that during the war of resistance, the compatriots in the motherland had made great sacrifices and suffered greatly. Although the overseas Chinese are far away, they have never forgotten their concern for the motherland. Therefore, this time they organized a 慰勞団 to return to the country to慰勞 the front-line soldiers and the compatriots in the rear. The motherland has made rapid progress in military, political, economic, cultural, and educational aspects, and they firmly believe that victory will belong to us. The total number of overseas Chinese has always been said to be 8 million, but in fact it is more than 11 million, all of whom are excellent sons and daughters of China. In the past, they have enthusiastically donated money and materials to help domestic refugees and wounded soldiers. Now, they are even more willing to send representatives to visit the motherland to express their condolences. This is not only a responsibility that citizens should fulfill, but also sufficient to show the sincerity of the overseas Chinese. This 慰勞団 did not bring material back to the country, but only brought the patriotic heart of tens of millions of overseas Chinese. At present, there is an urgent need for medicines on the front lines. Due to the limited number of members in this团, they were unable to bring them. They have now found other ways to instruct the Fundraising Committee of the Dutch East Indies to purchase 300,000 guilders (approximately 2 million national currency) worth of quinine and transport it back to the motherland. In addition, overseas Chinese in Malaya have purchased more than 100,000 yuan worth of medicines, which are also on their way. After receiving instructions from Chairman Chiang to request aspirin, they have first transported back the previously purchased stock. In the future, they plan to establish a large-scale pharmaceutical factory in Chongqing to manufacture various medicines and will try to use domestic raw materials as much as possible. The existing pharmaceutical machinery in Southeast Asia is being successively transported back to the motherland for use, etc. (27th dispatch)

Editorial

### The Suixi Campaign and Its Significance

In recent days, Chinese forces on both the northern and southern fronts have achieved significant victories: on the far right flank, Lingshan in Guinan has been recaptured, and Japanese troops have retreated towards Yongqin; on the far left flank, the new and old cities of Wuyuan, Xishanzui, and various strongholds in the Wulin area in Suixi have been recaptured, with the annihilation of over 3,000 Japanese troops. With frequent victories being reported, the populace rejoices, as if providing a factual response to the Japanese side's disjointed political offensive. The Guinan battlefront, not far from the sea and land borders and close to the southwestern hinterland, is closely watched by both domestic and foreign observers, and its developments are generally well-known. As for the Suixi area, its importance may be even greater than that of Guinan, but it is often overlooked due to its remote location. Therefore, based on what we have seen, we will briefly discuss it.

The Suixi area encompasses the three counties of Anbei, Wuyuan, and Linhe, also known as the Houtao region. The Daqing Mountains stretch to the north, the Yellow River flows around the south, and the Wula Mountains lie across the middle, with a vast loess plain in between. Although the area is close to the northern frontier and may evoke images of barren deserts, the soil is fertile and the region is rich in resources, making it China's most promising granary and pasture, with military value as well. However, the area has long been under the jurisdiction of Mongolian banners, and its administration was established relatively late. Only after the庚子 incident were large-scale reclamation policies promoted. Today's bandit leader Wang Ying, who willingly serves as a henchman of the Japanese, has a father, Wang Tongchun, who was a meritorious official who painstakingly pioneered and developed Suixi. The area is inhabited by both Mongolians and Han Chinese, making it prone to discord. In recent years, the Japanese side has also been actively instigating unrest, often using the so-called Inner Mongolian autonomy issue as a pretext, which has repeatedly evolved into a conspiracy to betray the motherland. In the years 1935 and 1936, the conspiracy almost reached its peak. On one hand, Japanese special agencies spread throughout the entire province of Sui and even reached Dingyuanying and Juyan in the Ningxia area. On the other hand, the Japanese and their puppets used Zhangbei and Bailingmiao as bases, attempting to advance along Suining to spy on Xinjiang, isolate Sino-Soviet communications, and complete a grand encirclement of Outer Mongolia. Although the Japanese and their puppets were defeated in the battles of Honggetu and Bailingmiao, the full-scale war of resistance broke out in an instant. With the loss of Suiyuan and Baotou, the momentum of the western invasion intensified. Fortunately, Fu Zuoyi, Ma Zhanshan, and various Mongolian and Hui forces supported the resistance with great difficulty, fighting in the Daqing and Wula Mountains and the Hetao desert. They reformed military and political affairs, appeased and resettled refugees, and launched guerrilla warfare from time to time, stabilizing half of Suixi. At that time, the Japanese troops extensively built roads and fortifications in the occupied areas and actively engaged in military preparations for attacking Mongolia and the Soviet Union under the guise of supporting the puppet Mongolian regime. Therefore, the apparent peace in the Suixi war situation in recent years is due to the Japanese military being heavily engaged in the Central Plains and lacking sufficient strength to use in the northern deserts. At the same time, the Japanese leaders have never underestimated Suixi as something easily obtainable, viewing it as something that need not be urgently pursued. However, the Japanese side has never ceased its greedy desire for westward and northward aggression and has always regarded Sui province as an important fulcrum in the northern theater. Some commentators have stated that Suiyuan is one of the areas in China that Japan is least willing to easily give up militarily. Judging from the Konoe statement and Japanese public and private documents, this is an undeniable truth.

In late December of last year, Chinese forces launched a light cavalry surprise attack, rushing into Baotou. After a day of street fighting, they withdrew their entire force after achieving battlefield results. The enraged Japanese troops gathered reinforcements and invaded the Houtao area from Baotou and Anbei in mid-January, even reaching Huangyang Mutou on the border of Suining. Some commentators worried that the continued advance of the Japanese troops would endanger international communications, but they underestimated the fact that the Japanese troops were merely taking a risk in the hope of success and did not have any meticulous planning or deployment. At that time, it was the height of winter, and the Yellow River water was shallow, having lost its natural barrier function. The Japanese troops along the Yellow River in Shanxi and Suiyuan never launched a large-scale crossing of the river to provide support, which shows that although the Japanese troops had great ambitions for Suixi, their isolated advance was nothing more than a luxury. Therefore, when the Japanese troops reached the edge of the desert, their strength was already showing signs of exhaustion. Even if the follow-up forces continued to advance, they would inevitably face difficulties due to the natural barrier of Shizuishan and the uninhabited deserts of several hundred li, and they would have no way to cross the river. Suixi has a dense network of canals, somewhat similar to the water towns of Jiangnan. Even if the Japanese troops and their mechanized units can move freely in the freezing season, they will inevitably feel strained after the ice melts in early spring. As expected, the Chinese counter-offensive in mid-February achieved initial success, and Linhe and Shanba were recaptured in succession. After more than a month of hard fighting, the two cities of Wuyuan and the foothills of the Wula Mountains were also recaptured by Chinese forces. The Japanese invasion of the west will inevitably come to an end with this campaign.

The simultaneous victories in Suixi and Guinan also have special significance. It is an undeniable fact that the fighting strength of the Japanese troops is declining day by day. A year or so ago, the Japanese offensive showed signs of slowing down and was far less sharp than at the beginning. However, whenever they occupied an area, their defensive fortifications would be completed after a short period of time, making it difficult to counterattack. But now, the facts prove that the defensive strength of the Japanese troops is far inferior to what it used to be. Those who slander the war of resistance often criticize Chinese forces for never having captured a famous city. This is a fundamental misunderstanding that deliberately ignores the nature and purpose of the "strategy of attrition." However, the recently captured Wuyuan is an important town in Suixi and a hub in the northwest. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, it has been an important fortress for defending the northern frontier. The Japanese side also intended to hold it for a long time after occupying it this time, so the recapture of this stronghold has extremely profound significance and its impact is not ordinary. This is one aspect. Suixi has always been regarded as a base for cutting off Sino-Soviet communications and encircling Outer Mongolia. However, in the past few years, its strength has only been able to dominate eastern Suixi, and it has never achieved its dream of westward and northward aggression. This time, as soon as it tried, it was defeated, which should be a serious blow to the Japanese northern advance strategy. This is the second aspect. Dividing national unity and provoking恶感 among 部, is a common trick used by aggressors. Recently, they have frequently promoted rumors of Mongol-Hui-Han discord and friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, hoping to provoke division and weaken the resistance. However, according to the United Press, the forces participating in the battle of Wuyuan this time included Ma Hongkui's Ningxia Hui cavalry and Ma Zhanshan's Northeast cavalry, the Eighth Route Army guerrilla forces, Fu Zuoyi's infantry, the Inner Mongolian Self-Defense Force, and the Central Army working closely together to attack simultaneously. This shows that all ethnic groups and factions in China have always fought shoulder to shoulder and worked together for the nation, with absolutely no rifts to speak of. This not only proves the sincere unity among the various ethnic groups and troops but also clears up baseless rumors of friction and conflict. This is the third aspect.

Although the Sino-Japanese battlefield stretches for thousands of kilometers, the recent situation focuses on the two wings, the far left and the far right. These two wings can also symbolize the Japanese power's bifurcated path of southward and northward aggression. Now that the Japanese troops on both wings have suffered defeat, no matter what attempts the Japanese side makes in the political sphere in the future, the outlook for its military future is not difficult to foresee.

### Bankers' Meeting in Chongqing - The Exchange Value of Legal Tender is Stable - The Establishment of the "New Regime" Will Absolutely Not Affect Legal Tender - Wang Kemin's Talk to Foreign Journalists Upon Returning to Beiping

Chongqing: Reuters received news from responsible sources that bankers held a meeting here yesterday afternoon and unanimously resolved that "the establishment of the Wang Jingwei puppet government will absolutely not affect the exchange value of legal tender, and legal tender will continue to have strong support." (27th Reuters dispatch)

Beiping: Wang Kemin, the head of the "Provisional Government," recently returned here from Nanjing and told foreign journalists that the establishment of the "reorganized National Government" may not cause any changes in the personnel of the North China administrative organs. External affairs will be handled by the "Central Government." The status of the new Chinese army in North China has not been decided. In Nanjing, only the date and location for organizing the new administrative organs were discussed. Wang's trip south seemed quite satisfactory. However, since he agreed to cancel the independent status of his provisional government, he said little about future arrangements, which is quite strange. (27th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: The Xinhua Daily News recently published an editorial discussing Wang Jingwei's "new regime," stating that "Our slogans are (1) Support the National Government and Chairman Chiang; (2) Oppose Wang Jingwei's puppet government; (3) Implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and Chairman Chiang's orders. At this critical moment, the entire population, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and all anti-Japanese organizations must unite to overthrow Wang's puppet government." (27th Reuters dispatch)

### Grave Disaster Situation in Hebei: Six Million Refugees Starving, Disaster Area Covers 16,000 Square Miles

Chongqing: According to representatives from the Hebei disaster area who recently arrived here, there are six million refugees in central Hebei facing starvation. These people are filling their stomachs with tree bark and grass roots, and all the cats and dogs have been eaten. Farmers have no seeds for spring plowing, so there is no hope for an autumn harvest. The government's previous allocation of 1,500,000 yuan for relief is merely a drop in the bucket. (United Press, 27th)

Tianjin: According to people engaged in relief work here, at least four million farmers in eastern Hebei are on the verge of starvation due to war and floods. Last year's harvest in many areas was destroyed by water. At the same time, there is a lack of seeds, making it impossible to continue planting. In addition, in many areas, the water has not yet receded, making cultivation impossible. Therefore, there is no hope for an autumn harvest this year. According to Hantson of the Bible Society, it is no exaggeration to say that farmers in many areas are living on tree bark. In some areas, the wheat seedlings have just sprouted, and starving people are already taking the seedlings to fill their stomachs. In addition, it is common for Chinese farmers to eat water plants and wood shavings. The number of families committing suicide due to lack of food is increasing daily. According to samples of food used by farmers in the interior of Hebei displayed by Walker, leader of the Salvation Army here, the food used by these farmers includes cotton from cotton pads, withered water plants, sweet potato vines, and chaff. At the same time, birds in Hebei and Shandong are also suffering the same fate of starvation as humans. These birds are so hungry that they often dig up the seeds sown by farmers from the soil to eat. Therefore, there is even less hope for an autumn harvest this year. According to church statistics, last year's floods inundated 12,000 villages in rural Hebei and 2,000 in Shandong. The disaster area covers 16,000 square miles. Currently, there are still 4,000 square miles where the water depth reaches ten feet. Although there is still flour left in the cities of Hebei, the price is so high that poor farmers and laborers cannot afford to buy it. Currently, there are still 80,000 refugees who fled from the interior last year in Tianjin. The Salvation Army is doing its best to find ways to help them return to their hometowns, but so far only 12,000 people have been sent back, each provided with food, clothing, and a small amount of money. According to medical authorities here, the refugees who remain here have already developed various diseases due to malnutrition, such as trachoma, pneumonia, lung disease, and skin diseases. Scarlet fever is particularly prevalent. According to someone from a hospital here, minor illnesses in the poor often turn into serious illnesses due to malnutrition. Sometimes, even ordinary chickenpox can turn into carbuncles. In addition, the refugees here are afraid that they will have no means of livelihood if they return to their hometowns, so many are moving to the Northeast. However, because they lack the money to buy train tickets, many families are walking five hundred miles to make a living. (United Press, 27th)

### British Nationals in Tianjin Encounter Unreasonable Obstacles by the Japanese at the Concession Exit

Tianjin: The British Consul-General in Tianjin, White, recently urged the Japanese Consul-General to pay attention to the increasing number of British nationals being unreasonably obstructed at the exit of the concession in the past few days. In addition to the increasing difficulties encountered by single British nationals at the exit, on Monday and Tuesday, two groups of British nationals, including prominent figures and officials from the British Concession’s Public Works Bureau, were returning to Tianjin after a short vacation in Beidaihe. They were also obstructed at the exit for more than two hours without any obvious reason before being allowed to pass. (Reuters, 27th)

Tokyo: A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently responded to inquiries, stating his personal opinion that there are still many issues that need to be resolved before the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin can be lifted. However, the nature of these issues could not be disclosed. The above inquiry was made in response to the remarks made by a military spokesperson on the 19th of this month, who claimed at the time that, in his personal opinion, there was no hope of lifting the blockade of Tianjin unless Japan, Italy, and other countries returned their concessions to China. Later, the military spokesperson said, "This was a joke." (Reuters, 27th)

The main points to be observed during registration are: (1) Cultivating a spirit of goodwill towards all people; (2) Abolishing the practice of not contacting "untouchables"; (3) Spinning by hand, using only homespun cloth, and rejecting all substitutes. Gandhi's orders are widely regarded as the first practical step in preparing for a "civil disobedience" movement. The order explicitly states that violence must not be used under any circumstances. Gandhi's article states, "As long as violence exists among us, I cannot engage in the struggle. If the registration to be carried out is done in good faith, then I am willing to engage in the struggle." Gandhi hopes that the All-India Congress Committee will organize a passive resistance committee. If there is an enthusiastic response within a month, the step-by-step actions of the passive resistance committee can be expected to succeed in a predictable time. Gandhi also said, "Action without violence means enlisting the world's sympathy against the evil. The number of thoughtful women who abhor the spirit of war is increasing daily. They all hope to find a path to peace and expect India to show the way. If we do not sincerely take action without violence, we cannot obtain the world's sympathy." (Reuters, 27th dispatch)

It is reported that large numbers of German aircraft have flown over the northeastern parts of France. On the evening of Monday and yesterday, formations of three, seven, and thirteen German aircraft were spotted over various areas behind the Maginot Line.

### People of Various Countries Apply to Immigrate to the U.S.; Quotas for the Next Several Years Are Already Full

Washington: According to figures released by the State Department, since the Munich Conference, the number of foreigners applying to immigrate to the United States has greatly increased, filling the immigration quotas for foreigners for the next several years.

### New Zealand Prime Minister Dies

London: London received the sad news of the death of New Zealand Prime Minister Savage yesterday, which is deeply regrettable. Savage was sixty-eight years old and had been ill for a long time. When the war broke out last September, Savage was recuperating after abdominal surgery, but he worked hard despite his illness. The fact that the New Zealand Expeditionary Force arrived in the Near East last month is a testament to his efforts. Newspapers recently reviewed Savage's implementation of several important social programs during his tenure and praised his excellent political achievements and great character. Savage was born in Victoria, Australia, the son of a farmer. He dropped out of school at the age of fourteen and first worked as a shop assistant and then as a miner. Later, he engaged in the cooperative movement and paid attention to politics. He was appointed as the secretary of the North Burnside Labor Political Association of Australia. He moved to New Zealand in 1907 and became an important member of the Auckland Labor Political circle. He held important positions in local organizations for many years. In 1919, he was elected to the New Zealand House of Representatives as the leader of the Labor Party. In 1935, the ten-party candidates won, and Savage organized the first Labor cabinet, focusing on assisting the unemployed and protecting the interests of workers, which was strongly supported by the Labor Party. In the general election held in October 1938, the Labor Party won 55 of the 80 seats in parliament, and Savage was re-elected as Prime Minister of New Zealand until today. (Reuters, 27th dispatch)

### DuPont's Nylon Stockings to Be Available in Spring/Summer, a Formidable Enemy for the Japanese Silk Industry

Washington: Nylon stockings made from the new synthetic fiber invented by DuPont, which could be a formidable enemy for the Japanese silk industry, will be sold in the market in the spring or early summer. Nylon synthetic fiber is a recently invented material and has now reached a state of perfection. Stockings made from this material can replace real silk. Its advantages are that it is fine and durable. In tests, a pair of nylon stockings was worn every day for several weeks without needing to be repaired or broken. American women are eagerly awaiting the early availability of these stockings, and Japanese silk exporters are paying close attention to this. (Reuters, 27th dispatch)

The British ship then encountered a German fishing boat, which had previously requested our assistance. Later, a German ship was sailing south, escorted by one of our gunboats. The British destroyer again sailed to nearby waters, intending to identify the name of the German ship, but after our gunboat made a request, it immediately sailed out of our territorial waters. By the 22nd of this month, there were eight or nine British destroyers operating in our waters. Two of them chased a German cargo ship until it was one mile from our sea before turning back. (Havas, 26th dispatch)

### British Aircraft Carrier "Ark Royal" Not Sunk by German Aircraft; Sailed for Five Months and Has Now Returned Home; Traveled from the Equator to the Northern Frigid Zone

London: The British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal", which the Germans claimed to have bombed and sunk last year, has returned home after sailing abroad for five months. It is estimated that the ship and its aircraft have traveled five million square miles of the sea from the equatorial tropics to the northern frigid zone in these five months, and participated in the interception of three large German merchant ships. Its aircraft attacked several German submarines, causing the remaining German submarines to hastily submerge, but the results of the attacks are unknown. The ship was attacked by a German aircraft, which dropped a thousand-pound bomb that fell fifteen feet away from the bow of the ship, but apart from shattering some pottery in the ship, the British ship was not damaged. Captain Power, who has been the captain of the ship since it entered service two years ago, told a Reuters reporter about the near-miss of a torpedo attack around October last year when the British ship "Courageous" was lost. The torpedo passed through the water two to three hundred yards behind the ship. The destroyers protecting the "Ark Royal" rescued some of the crew members of the German submarine after the attack. Captain Power also recounted the situation of the air attack, saying that one of the incoming German aircraft was the bravest, descending rapidly towards the ship from an altitude of about 4,000 feet, and then rising again at 1,000 feet. He saw a bomb leaving the aircraft, and the bomb was unprecedentedly large. He was standing on the bridge and saw the bomb descending and immediately realized that the bomb would not hit the ship. The bomb fell about fifteen feet away from the side of the ship. Even if it had hit, it would not have sunk the "Ark Royal." Captain Power also denied the claim that the "Ark Royal" was tilting, saying that the ship's propeller came off and the bow was slightly damaged, but apart from shattering some pottery, there was no other damage. After this, the "Ark Royal" crossed the Atlantic Ocean and went to Cape Town. Its aircraft participated in the search for the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee", but when the German ship was found by the British ships "Exeter", "Ajax", and "Achilles", the "Ark Royal" was one thousand miles away. Its aircraft took off more than a hundred times, and several of them were lost after getting lost. (Reuters, 27th dispatch)

### Japanese Parliament Closes Yesterday Morning; Newspapers Criticize the Cabinet

Tokyo: The Japanese Parliament closed this morning after Prime Minister Yonai read the Emperor's edict. Japanese newspapers believe that the 10,000,000,000 yen budget is a precursor to economic and social reforms. The Sino-Japanese problem has not yet been resolved and requires huge expenses. The defense budget is the backbone of Japan's new policy and has stipulated a three-year military build-up plan. Newspapers fiercely criticize party politics and blame the cabinet for lacking constructive plans in terms of diplomacy. Newspapers are demanding that Japan strengthen cooperation with countries that recognize the status quo in the Far East. According to the Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun," after the establishment of the "new government," the Yangtze River navigation below Nanjing will be restored. (Haitong, 27th dispatch)

It is said that the purpose of this move is to popularize aviation knowledge and skills, so that Japan will leap to become an air power in the future. (Havas, 26th dispatch)

### Aborted Coup in Bolivia: Bloodless Uprising Quickly Quelled, Anti-Government Conspiracy Also Uncovered in Brazil

La Paz, Bolivia - A political conspiracy to overthrow President Quintanilla was uncovered here today. It originated with several young military officers who had long been dissatisfied with the current government. Today, Lieutenant Cabero led a battalion of constabulary in an attempted uprising, but the plan was leaked and ultimately failed. The government later issued a statement saying that the rebellion had been quelled and everything had returned to normal. By dusk, crowds gathered in front of the presidential palace to express their support for the government and demand that the government arm them to help quell the unrest. The Minister of Agriculture, representing the President, immediately offered words of comfort. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)

La Paz, Bolivia - Regarding the timely suppression of the political conspiracy, political figures here unanimously stated that the reason the unrest was quelled bloodlessly was thanks to the firm stance of Army Chief of Staff General Enteno. A portion of the military officers, due to the upcoming congressional session, feared potential disadvantages to the army and conspired to support General Enteno, who sternly refused, rebuked the officers for their rebellious actions, and planned to prevent the National Army from entering the arsenal in the capital. Upon hearing the news, General Enteno personally led a team of soldiers to defeat them, thus quelling the unrest. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)

### French Prime Minister Urges National Unity to Face the Situation; Emphasizes the Government's Responsibility is to Wage Total War, Ensuring Everyone Does Their Utmost in the Arduous Struggle to Achieve Victory

Paris - Prime Minister Reynaud delivered a radio address last night, explaining the process of forming the cabinet and emphasizing that the government's responsibility is to wage total war, hoping that the entire nation will unite to face the situation. An abstract of his speech is as follows: The Prime Minister first stated that the sole objective of his cabinet formation was to establish a government that possesses great determination in action, as war requires determination. He invited all parties to participate in the new cabinet without any prejudice. Although this has not been fully achieved, he believes that the results of their future actions will lead to national unity. It should be known that frequent changes of the cabinet during wartime would only satisfy the policies pursued by German leader Hitler. This crisis has now been fortunately avoided. The question from now on is how to handle national affairs. He has formed a war council at the core of the cabinet, composed of nine key cabinet members. There is no concern that there will be too few people during discussions, and no concern that there will be too many people during action, so it can adapt to the needs of wartime. In short, they have created a kind of sharp weapon, and now it should be put to use. In essence, all decisions should be thoroughly discussed in advance, while all actions should be swift and decisive. That is all. As for the war goals of our country, they have been repeatedly clarified before, so there is no need to repeat them. In a word, our goal remains to defeat the enemy, with absolutely no changes. The people should know that the current situation is a critical juncture, the importance of which is rare in our nation's history. Hitler has previously invaded the Rhineland area, the Memel area, and Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland one after another. Now, he is preparing to invade the economic independence of the Balkan Peninsula countries and openly expand his hegemony to most of Europe. If we allow the enemy to calmly deploy and organize under the National Socialist political system, not only will freedom be extinguished, but the French Republic will also be difficult to preserve. Under this kind of threat, we can only follow the instincts left by generations of wise men and work hard. The government's current responsibility is also very clear: only by waging total war can we overcome the strong enemy. Since the start of the war, our country has resisted the enemy's invasion for seven months. According to historical records, our country has often retreated before advancing in previous wars. Only this time, the enemy has not been able to defeat us at the beginning of the war. Although we clearly know that the current stalemate will eventually change, one thing is certain: France is prepared and will never allow the enemy to invade its territory even one step. Not only that, but our country's military authorities, relying on a comprehensive and strong national defense organization, have been able to minimize the dangers faced by our soldiers and fully protect the safety of our territory. In other words, we have been able to exchange the highest degree of safety for the least possible sacrifice in terms of military strength. Although this alone is not enough to win, in this kind of war of the entire nation, it is also impossible to limit the war to one aspect. For example, in modern warfare, military equipment is the most important thing. Therefore, industrial equipment, the supply of raw materials, the replenishment of workers, and the smooth flow of transportation must all be taken into account. Moreover, in addition to fighting abroad, the country must also take into account the people's livelihood. Therefore, the people must not only fight in the military, but also in agriculture. In order to maintain the balance of foreign trade, our country must also do its best to maintain export trade. For this reason, during this war, not only the army needs people, and the countryside needs people, but also export trade needs people. Thoroughly speaking, everyone in the country should work for the country, whether on the battlefield, in factories, or in the fields. It is necessary to make the best use of everyone's talents and resources. The government's task is to make sure that everyone is in their place. Anyone who still works at the rate of peacetime during wartime is a sinner against the country. At this point, sticking to normal methods is already insufficient. Everyone must work harder to be effective. As for any attempt to hinder the country's struggle, we must eliminate it. In a word, this war will definitely be very difficult. Therefore, we must struggle hard, endure hardship, and find joy in it. We believe that the final victory will belong to us, because we have gathered the resources of the world's two major empires in one place. As long as we can fully utilize them, it is a guarantee that we will be able to win. Moreover, before we win militarily, if we want to achieve anything diplomatically, it depends on our strength and the number of tanks, airplanes, and cannons. Therefore, the final key still depends on the work ethic, spirit, determination, and ability to endure hardship of our entire people. The responsibility lies on our shoulders, and our fate is entirely in our own hands. Therefore, we must stride forward, face the situation together, not succumb to the current difficulties, and strive to overcome them." (Havas Dispatch, 27th)

### French Prime Minister to Convene Meeting of Ambassadors to Europe to Review International Situation

### British War Cabinet to be Reorganized

London - According to a Reuters correspondent in Parliament, there is widespread speculation that opposition party members may join the cabinet soon. After inquiring from various sources, very few believe this to be true. However, judging from the current situation, the organization of the government seems likely to change soon, with a smaller group dedicated to directing the war effort. The changes in the leaders of the Ministry of Defense are likely to involve more than one person. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

### French Government Requests Soviet Union to Replace Ambassador to France; Suritz's Congratulatory Telegram Provokes French Displeasure; Anglo-French Relations Unaffected

London - According to a TASS news agency report, Soviet Ambassador to France, Suritz, has now been dismissed because the Soviet authorities recognized that he was no longer an envoy favored by the French government. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

Moscow - Soviet diplomatic officials said this afternoon that the French government's request for the Soviet government to recall its ambassador to France, Suritz, would not lead to a breakdown in relations between the two countries. Since Ambassador Natchia left office, the French embassy in the Soviet Union has only had a chargé d'affaires handling embassy affairs. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

London - When someone asked today whether the recall of Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz had any impact on Anglo-Soviet relations, a spokesperson replied that Anglo-Soviet relations remained unchanged. Suritz's recall was purely an event between the French and Soviet governments and Suritz himself, and had nothing to do with the British government. According to information obtained by Reuters, the telegram submitted by the French government was clearly not a document enjoying diplomatic privileges, but rather a telegram sent by the ambassador on behalf of the Soviet community in Paris. The telegram was encoded in French, so it was subject to the usual French inspection. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

Paris - The general public here believes that the French negotiations in Moscow, which resulted in the Kremlin recalling its ambassador to France, Suritz, demonstrates France's firm will to have its rights respected. Although France is willing to maintain good relations with all neutral countries, it will be difficult to tolerate those who use neutrality as a shield to engage in actions that are truly detrimental to France. Since the start of the war, the Soviet Union has repeatedly demanded all the rights of neutral countries, and has successively signed agreements with Germany. France has still agreed to maintain normal relations between the two countries, but France is unwilling to be fooled. The French side believes that the wording of the telegram sent by the ambassador to Stalin after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty was not permitted by diplomats. The strong actions immediately taken by the French government are said to be entirely within the international scope, but not unrelated to the various measures recently taken to suppress all actions within the country that are detrimental to the Allied countries. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

Moscow - On March 19, French Counselor in Moscow, Beyerde, notified Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov that "when the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty was signed, Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz sent a telegram congratulating Stalin (signed by Suritz and sent back to Moscow via the Paris Telegraph Office). The French government believes that Suritz's actions interfere with the political life of France." Beyerde's notification also stated, "The French government considers certain paragraphs of the telegram to be inappropriate. The telegram stated, 'Due to the implementation of the wise policies of the Soviet government and the bravery of our Red Army, the plans stipulated by the Anglo-French war provocateurs who attempted to expand the war in Northeast Europe have failed (the words 'Anglo-French war provocateurs' are underlined). At the same time, the Soviet Union remains an impregnable fortress, and the conspiracies of the enemies of socialism and the enemies of the working masses all over the world will also be crushed in the future (the words 'conspiracies of the enemies of socialism' are underlined).' Although the telegram has been detained by inspectors, the French government still declares that it no longer regards Suritz as a diplomatic representative and sincerely hopes that the Soviet government will recall Suritz immediately."

Regarding this point, Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lozovsky yesterday handed Beyerde the Soviet government's reply, which stated, "(1) The French government believes that because Suritz's telegram does not mention the French government at all, it will no longer regard Suritz as a 'diplomatic representative.' The Soviet government believes that the French side's attitude is completely unjustified. (2) Although the French government has now formally raised the issue of its trust in Suritz, the Soviet government hereby declares that Suritz will be relieved of his post as ambassador to France." (TASS Dispatch, 27th)

### Outcome of Italian-Hungarian Talks: Formulation of a General Outline for Future Cooperation; Preservation of Peace in Southeastern Europe

Rome - Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki met with Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday afternoon for talks. Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Minister to Italy Vilani were also present. An official statement said that the talks lasted two hours and were very cordial. A general outline for future cooperation between the two countries was formulated on the spot. The friendship between the two countries is not only fully compatible with the relations between Italy and Germany and between Germany and Hungary, but also runs parallel to Italy's relations with Yugoslavia. In short, the Italian and Hungarian governments should coordinate their actions to preserve peace in the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River Basin. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)

Rome - Prime Minister Teleki is scheduled to meet with Pope Pius XII on the morning of the 28th of this month, and then return to Budapest in the evening. The local "Tribune" recently published an interview with Prime Minister Teleki, which stated, "I have no special goals for this trip, only to exchange views on the international situation with the Italian authorities. There is no unrest in the Balkan Peninsula at present, but this does not mean that all problems have been resolved. Our country is very aware of the current difficulties, so our attitude is in line with the urgent needs of Europe and is quite patient, waiting for the development of the situation. As for our country's friendly relations with Yugoslavia, they can continue to improve, but it is not necessary to sign any agreements immediately." In addition, our country's relations with the Soviet Union are also normal, and there have never been disputes on the Hungarian-Soviet border. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)

Budapest - The Hungarian government's mouthpiece, the "Sterau Habo," recently published a statement saying that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki's recent talks in Rome were nothing more than an exchange of views on the common policy of building peace between Italy and Hungary. First, Hungary is now not within the sphere of influence of any major power. In the future, no unilateral decisions may be made regarding Hungary without Hungary's consent, because this period has passed. Second, Hungary does not need to request Italy's support. Italian-Hungarian friendship is extremely close. The Italian side will not even allow a situation to arise that would cause Hungary to ask for its help. Italy has no intention of making Hungary give up its demands to revise its borders. Third, Rome has always known that Hungary's policy for Europe is aimed at the interests of all of Europe, so it has the full support of Italy. Fourth, the sole purpose of the Italian-Hungarian consultation is to study the world situation from the perspective of the common interests of the two countries. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

### British-French-Turkish Consultation on Military Cooperation; Turkish Delegation Returns to Ankara

Rome - According to Ankara telegrams, the Turkish military delegation, which went to Aleppo last week to meet with the Allied military leaders, has now returned here. The leader of the delegation is the Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff, General Gunduz. The matters discussed were the coordination of the military forces of Turkey, Britain, and France, and cooperation under the tripartite agreement. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

London - Foreign diplomatic officials here recently stated that the British and French governments will hold talks in the shortest possible time regarding the Balkan Peninsula issue and intend to adopt a tougher policy. According to reports from various sources, Turkey's attitude towards the British-French alliance has always been consistent and without any doubt. If Britain and France are forced to take action in the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey will definitely act in unison. In addition, according to information known to political figures here, the blockade measures implemented by Britain and France against Germany will be intensified in all aspects, regardless of the consequences, even if it causes disputes with the Soviet Union. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)

Istanbul - It is declared here that French air defense expert General Moren is currently in Izmir, inspecting the Turkish army. He will reform the air defense measures in Istanbul to modernize them. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

### Soviet-Lithuanian Friendship Progresses Daily; Soviet Newspaper Publishes Commentary

Moscow - Nikolaev recently wrote an article in Pravda detailing "Today's Lithuania." The article stated, "Six months have passed since the Soviet Union and Lithuania signed the mutual assistance treaty. During this period, all the malicious rumors spread by the enemies of the Soviet Union and Lithuania have been completely proven to be untrue. Their conspiracies have been shattered and they have now retreated and stopped making noise. The Soviet-Lithuanian mutual assistance treaty has prevented Lithuania from being dragged into the Second Imperialist War. This treaty has greatly constrained the Anglo-French group, otherwise they would have incited the Baltic countries to participate in the war long ago (they are now carrying out the same incitement in Scandinavia and the Balkan countries). The territorial integrity of Lithuania is currently protected not only by the Lithuanian army, but also by the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union. The strength of the Lithuanian army is now progressing daily. Lithuanian commanders are able to make good use of the Soviet Union's assistance in providing them with military equipment and military raw materials. The Lithuanian Daily stated, "The Soviet-Lithuanian mutual assistance treaty is a decisive investment increase for Lithuania. New industries and trade have been established in Lithuania." All of this is enough to prove the shamelessness of the rumor-mongers (the rumor-mongers have repeatedly tried to make all parties doubt the sincerity of the Soviet Union's cooperation with the Baltic countries). The Soviet Union has now found the simplest way to unite the Soviet Union with the small neighboring countries. This method has never hindered the independence and freedom of the small countries. We dare to say that Lithuania has obtained a new life and added new achievements to its national history." (TASS Dispatch, 26th)

### The Mystery of Molotov's Visit to Berlin; Rumors that German-Soviet Preparatory Talks are Underway; Progress Seems Unsuccessful

Amsterdam - According to this correspondent of the "News Daily" stationed in Berlin, it is undeniable that the preparatory talks for the new German-Soviet contact are progressing unfavorably. The main obstacle is clearly the issue that Soviet-Italian reconciliation must be based on Soviet guarantees to Turkey and Romania. Moscow seems unwilling to abandon its ambitions in the Balkans in the limited time. The correspondent also stated that the rhetoric of the Nazi newspapers has completely changed. The claim that the close cooperation between Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union would create a "New Europe," which was promoted by the newspapers last week, can no longer be seen. On Saturday and Sunday last week, a German government spokesperson hinted that the visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Germany was near, but now, when asked about this matter, they only stated that the Soviet Union had denied this visit. Berlin has noticed the Italian side's coldness towards the German declaration of the Berlin-Rome-Moscow triangle relationship. In particular, Rome's radio telegram denied the rumor that the Italian delegation would begin negotiations with Moscow. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

Copenhagen - According to the "National Daily" here, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov will go to Berlin tomorrow to hold talks with the German authorities on the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. At the same time, the German side also intends to seize the opportunity to woo Italy and the Soviet Union, so that the two policies of the Rome-Berlin Axis and the Berlin-Moscow Axis can run in parallel, and even cooperate in Southeastern Europe. According to well-informed sources, the German authorities are currently working hard to encourage the Soviet Union to guarantee the territorial status quo of Romania. It is said that Bessarabia Province in Romania originally belonged to Russia (Havas Dispatch, 27th)

Berlin - Soviet Ambassador to Germany Shkvartsev will return here from Moscow at the end of the week. At the beginning of Shkvartsev's recall, it caused various rumors among foreign people here, saying that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov would come to Berlin to visit. At the same time, the newspapers here wrote articles discussing the Allied countries' intention to expand the scope of the war in Southeastern Europe and their intention to attack the Soviet Union. The "Strong Paper" said that the signing of a commercial treaty between the Soviet Union and Iran was a new blow to Britain's tricks. The "Berlin Evening News" also said that the new goal of Britain and France was to fight the Soviet Union. The German newspapers' attitude can be represented by the "Berlin Financial Paper." Its commentary stated that Britain has openly admitted to adopting various methods, using the countries of Southeastern Europe to at least economically destroy Germany. The London conspirators did not pay attention to Italy. It should be known that Italy, like Germany, is also paying close attention to the Allied countries' attempt to expand the war in Southeastern Europe. In short, the Allied countries' conspiracy was thoroughly commented on by the Jewish journalist Agan in the Belgian "Metropole Paper." His comment stated, "If the war continues for another ten months, then the neutral countries will no longer exist." (Reuter's Dispatch, 17th)

### American Strategist Johnson Advocates Strengthening the Army; Famous Commentator Winchell Claims America Will Fight for Canada and South America

New York - Strategist General Johnson, who is currently a political commentator for the New York World Telegram, is worried that Congress will "remove the core" from the funding for reforming the army. The General said that the outcome of the war is now uncertain, and the final division of the dictatorial powers of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan is also not certain. Therefore, there is a possibility of the emergence of one or two major ocean problems during this war. Our first line of defense now has gaps, but if there is a properly equipped army, then this gap is not dangerous. Famous commentator Winchell also wrote an article on the same issue, saying that the United States has a dual responsibility in this dangerous situation. In addition to protecting itself with the smallest army in the world, it also tells the world that we will fight for Canada and South America to protect them. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)

### German Oppression of Poles Intensifies; Warsaw University Forced to Close

Paris – The Polish government information office issued a bulletin today, stating that the German authorities' devastation of schools and maltreatment of educators in the occupied territories of Poland have intensified. For example, the Polish Academy of Fine Arts has been completely destroyed, and Warsaw University (founded in 1818, with 10,000 students) has been forced to close. Furthermore, many university professors have died, including the renowned architect and professor of the Academy of Fine Arts, Sosnowski, and the famous legal scholar of Warsaw University, Dr. Rudostan. In addition, several other professors have been arrested by the German authorities and detained in concentration camps. (Havas News Agency, 26th)

### Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Purchases Aircraft from American Millionaire: Lockheed 14, Perfectly Equipped

Washington – An aircraft owned by American millionaire Mr. du Pont, perfectly equipped, has now been purchased by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. This aircraft is a Lockheed 14, to be dismantled in Miami for transport to China. This aircraft is of the same type previously used by American aviator Hughes to break Post and Getty's world flight record. The aircraft can accommodate eight passengers and two crew members, and possesses almost every recent aviation instrument. (Reuters, 26th)

### Annual Report of the He Ming Chamber of Commerce States Optimism About China's Future; Japanese Restrictions on Third-Country Trade Remain Unchanged; No Date Set for Opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers

Shanghai's Chinese and Foreign Communities Bravely Endure Another Difficult Year

The North-China Daily News reports that the Shanghai He Ming Chamber of Commerce held its annual meeting on the 26th at Jardine Matheson & Co. on the Bund. Chairman Botweill addressed the members, expressing optimism about China's future and mentioning the countless difficulties encountered by foreign commercial interests during the past year, the reopening of the Yangtze River, and the situation of the Chinese railways. He also praised the resilience of the Chinese people and the courage and perseverance shown by the general merchants.

Having Endured Much Tribulation, Slight Improvement is Seen

Mr. Botweill's speech stated, in part: "Before discussing business, I would like to take this opportunity to represent all members in expressing our regret at Mr. Polson's departure from Shanghai due to illness, leaving his position as Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and wish Mr. Polson a speedy recovery. At the last annual meeting, the Chairman spoke of the courage and perseverance shown by Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai and other treaty ports in dealing with various difficulties. In the past twelve months, some difficulties and restrictions have been slightly relaxed, but this is hardly the case for Tianjin, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places. I believe that the improvement in the trade situation is actually due to the fact that Chinese and foreign merchants in the treaty ports have now endured much tribulation in adverse circumstances and will continue to work hard to achieve this."

Chinese Warfare Impacts Trade

"Trade and shipping gradually prospered last year, but unexpectedly, the outbreak of the European war had an adverse impact in the second half of the year, especially on overseas shipping. The war in China has been going on for three years now. Vast areas have been ravaged, the population scattered, and they are displaced and homeless. Railways, highways, and other means of transportation have been damaged or destroyed. Vast areas are blocked by the Japanese authorities and there is no free trade. The import and export of goods to and from China is still possible, but only a fraction of what trade once was. To what extent we will continue to suffer losses due to the European war remains to be seen. The resurgence of trade in China seems to depend on a satisfactory end to the wars in China and Europe. A dark period seems to lie ahead."

Shanghai's Future Remains Extremely Bright

"However, he has great faith in the future of Shanghai and China as an element of international commerce, hoping that the wars in China and Europe will achieve a healthy resolution, thereby establishing freer financial and economic exchanges between countries. The unification of "New China" under Wang Jingwei is a matter of much speculation, so the war in China is unlikely to end in the short term."

Soaring Prices Create Serious Situation

"In the past six months, the price index of ordinary daily necessities and rents in Shanghai has been of great concern. In January of this year, the price index reached 325.44, which has had a significant impact on workers. Fortunately, workers' wages have been gradually adjusted and subsidies have been issued, so no serious labor unrest has occurred. However, the situation in this area cannot be considered calm. All parties concerned, especially the local authorities of this city, must pay very careful attention to this situation. The urgent task of the authorities is to curb speculation and profiteering and raise prices. The two concessions have taken measures to achieve this goal, which is gratifying."

Astounding Trade Deficit

"According to statistics, China's customs revenue increased by about 77 million yuan in Chinese currency in 1929. However, at this time, it is not possible to accurately analyze the quantity. On the surface, this is an increase in trade. In fact, what has increased is only a limited type of import and export goods. The 1939 customs statistics show a trade deficit of over 300 million yuan. It should be noted that the value of imported goods is calculated by converting foreign currency into legal tender at the official exchange rate of 14.5 pence per unit. If calculated at the black market currency exchange rate, like export goods, the trade deficit would reach 2,194,000,000 yuan."

Japanese Restrictions Still Exist

"Restrictions remain in most treaty ports. Among them, the restrictions in some ports have practically brought third-country trade to a complete standstill. Third countries believe that the restrictions on trade and other commercial and financial activities are unnecessary and only hinder the return to normalcy and reconstruction work in the occupied areas. The purchasing power of the Chinese people has been greatly reduced, especially in 1939."

Most Railways Remain Under Control

"The Japanese army continues to collect necessary products in the areas it occupies to supply the needs of the Japanese army in the war zone, and to supply important raw materials to Japanese industries in China and Japan. From the perspective of foreign holders of railway bonds, the railway situation has not improved, and the Japanese army still prohibits bondholders from exercising their right to inspect and manage railway property. Most railways continue to be controlled by the Japanese. The restored railway commercial transportation in 1928 has seen a large increase, with brisk cargo and passenger transport. However, these railways were built with foreign debts that have not yet been repaid. Now they are carrying cargo and passengers, but they are not repaying a single cent to the bondholders."

The Opening of the Yangtze River is Far Off

"The Japanese government has allowed the opening of the Yangtze River and Pearl River below Nanjing for third-country ships to navigate. The date of opening has not yet been decided. It is hoped that the opening of these two rivers will not be delayed for long. As far as the Yangtze River is concerned, this Chamber of Commerce would like to see traffic resume to Hankou, or at least to Wuhu, as soon as possible. The fact that the Huangpu River and Wusongkou are still not dredged is a cause for concern. This issue is related to the shipping industry of all countries. Recently, it was heard that the Japanese authorities in this city had agreed to resume dredging the Huangpu River and Wusongkou, which is quite satisfactory. The dredging work has been suspended since the outbreak of the war in August 1937, and has hardly been dredged since then. This matter is of great concern to the people of all countries in Shanghai, and it is hoped that the Huangpu Conservancy Board will resume work without encountering unnecessary obstacles and restrictions."

Shanghai's Situation Remains Chaotic

"In 1939, the restrictions in Shanghai were slightly relaxed. However, Yangshupu, a key area for commerce, industry, and shipping, still faced difficulties at the end of the year, and transportation was inconvenient. Labor unrest occurred frequently. The restrictions on passage and curfew were lifted last month. The Nanshi area was also opened at the beginning of this year, but restrictions in other areas remain unchanged. The continued existence of the "badlands" in the western district is a cause of deep concern to the municipal authorities of the Public Concession, and the difficulties have been greatly increased because the "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau" occupies part of the administrative rights in this area, including the Concession roads. As a result of negotiations between the Municipal Council and representatives of the Municipal Government, an agreement on policing in the extraterritorial roads area was signed on February 16. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Municipal Council and the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai signed an agreement on policing in the area north of the Suzhou Creek."

The Rejuvenating Power of the Chinese People

"In summary, Shanghai has spent 1939 in the most satisfactory state that could be expected under such circumstances. This is largely due to the resilience of the Chinese people and the courage and perseverance shown by Chinese and foreign merchants in extremely difficult circumstances. I feel that we can be quite optimistic about the future. The sooner everyone understands that the lack of genuine cooperation between countries is a major obstacle to progress and prosperity, the sooner the beginning of a genuine connection to glory will begin."

### Lowering Flags Tomorrow to Commemorate Revolutionary Martyrs

Tomorrow is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang, namely, the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day. It has also been stipulated by the Central Government that the martyrdom of Deng Zhongyuan, Chen Ying, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and other martyrs, as well as the passing of Hu Zhantang and Huang Keqiang, will be commemorated on this day. All sectors of society remember the martyrs' generous sacrifice and great achievements. Tomorrow, flags will be lowered to half-mast and entertainment events will be suspended to express mourning. Schools and the Jianghai Customs, etc., will also be closed as usual. Due to the special environment, apart from memorial services held separately by schools, the memorial ceremony will not be expanded. All sectors of society will inherit the legacy of the martyrs, save the country from danger, resolutely support national policy, practice a thrift campaign, and contribute their strength to complete the great cause of resistance and nation-building. The Shanghai Honesty and Shame Movement has also formulated key points for commemoration, stating that, in today's environment, commemorating the revolutionary martyrs is of particularly great significance. All the martyrs adhered to the Three Principles of the People, followed the Premier, and were determined to revolutionize, fighting against the autocratic Qing dynasty. Although the cause was not successful, their spirit of generously going to their deaths was enough to make the Chinese people roar with anger. The Xinhai Revolution was finally completed. The martyrs' achievements will last forever. Although the citizens of Shanghai are in an isolated island with a special environment, high prices, and difficult living conditions, their hardships cannot be compared with those of the soldiers on the front lines and the refugees in the war zones. On this day of commemorating the martyrs, we should take the spirit of the martyrs as a model, sharpen our character, strictly abide by the creed of honesty and shame, and bring the bright future closer and closer.

### Public Concession Implements Austerity Measures; Chinese and Foreign Communities Unanimously Praise; Leaving Taxpayers Room to Breathe and Nurturing Tax Sources for the Future

The Public Concession Municipal Council planned to increase the general municipal rate, special property rate, and land rate surcharge by 5% starting on July 1 this year. The Chinese and foreign taxpayers, unable to bear the burden, unanimously expressed their opposition. Now the Municipal Council has organized a special committee to study the reduction of administrative expenses. All heads of Chinese departments have received notifications from the Council to try their best to save money within the possible scope. Eight Western staff members of the Works Department have already agreed to be dismissed. This policy will continue to be implemented. Chinese and foreign taxpayers within the boundary unanimously praised the Municipal Council's resolute implementation of staff reduction and austerity measures, coping with financial difficulties through belt-tightening. Taxpayers believe that in this difficult time, all places where savings can be made should be reduced as much as possible, without affecting administrative efficiency, so that the revenue is not unnecessarily used, leaving taxpayers room to breathe and nurturing tax sources for the future. However, taxpayers are concerned that the reduction in the food rations for prisoners may affect the nutrition of prisoners. They hope that the Municipal Council will give this matter serious consideration before implementation.

Eight Vacancies Will Not Be Filled

The Continental Times reports that regarding the authorities' reduction of eight Western staff members of the Works Department, the Director-General and Chief Executive Officer of the Municipal Council, Mr. Phillips, stated that the eight people laid off will not be replaced by others, because the Municipal Council's any department does not embrace the policy of dismissing old employees and hiring younger employees with lower salaries to replace them. As far as he knows, apart from the Works Department, the Municipal Council does not intend to immediately lay off staff in other departments. However, all department heads have received orders to practice thrift.

The Council Further Cuts One Western Staff Member

Also, the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that one more Western staff member of the Municipal Council's Works Department has been laid off. The person is Mr. Natte, an assistant in the accounting department, who has been working for 11 years. In three more years, he would have been able to receive the highest pension of 100 pounds per year. Having been laid off this time, he can get a pension of about 80 pounds a year.

Public Opinion Survey Opposes Rate Increase

The local "Purchase News" recently conducted a survey to investigate the opinions of people from all walks of life on the Municipal Council. According to reports, the magazine issued more than 5,000 opinion forms. Over a thousand completed opinion forms have been submitted to the magazine. The survey has now ended and was published yesterday. The details are as follows: In these one thousand opinion forms, 67% agree to hold the ratepayers' meeting on Saturday. 25% believe that it can also be approved if it is held after office hours. Only 8% agree to hold it at the original time (i.e., 2:30 pm on working days). Regarding the Municipal Council's proposed increase in the municipal rate, 96% believe that the salaries of the senior staff of the Municipal Council are too high, 94% believe that the Municipal Council's music team is too large, over 90% believe that houses and real estate held by speculators should also pay land rates to the Municipal Council to maintain the Municipal Council's expenses, 90% believe that the Municipal Council should find ways to maintain expenses without increasing the municipal rate, 80% believe that the Municipal Council's expenses should be fixed within a certain range, 80% believe that the Municipal Council's property should be sold to the highest bidder, 73% believe that the Municipal Council staff should be openly employed, 69% believe that the Municipal Council staff should have their salaries deducted during vacation leave, 84% believe that the Municipal Council's retention of high-salary old staff is a wrong measure, 71% believe that the Municipal Council's employee subsidy system should be abolished, 77% believe that the Municipal Council can issue a municipal lottery, and 94% believe that the suicide rate and various sufferings suffered by Chinese people in the Concession should be helped in some way.

### Minnie Moller and Maclay Lighters Requisitioned and Sailing South

The British-owned Jardine, Matheson & Co.'s Minnie Moller and Maclay lighters, originally chartered by shipping merchants, were respectively operating on the Ningbo-Songmen line and the Shanghai-Beisha line. The two vessels each have a carrying capacity of approximately 300 tons. It is now understood that both vessels are under orders from the British government for wartime use. After receiving the order, the vessels have separately suspended operations and returned to Shanghai, and will soon sail to the two oceans to await orders. It is also understood that since the start of the war, the British government has successively requisitioned several lighters in Shanghai, including four from the Shanghai Tug & Lighter Co., five from Jardine, Matheson & Co., and several steamships from the British-owned Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire companies have also been requisitioned.

### Japanese Izumo Battleship Sailed to Nanjing Yesterday Morning

The flagship Izumo of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet suddenly sailed out of Wusongkou on the afternoon of the 11th of this month and cruised around, returning to Shanghai on the 15th, berthing at the original site of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's wharf in Hongkou. At around 5:00 AM yesterday, it suddenly raised anchor and sailed out of port, heading up the river. It is said that it is going to Nanjing. It is heard that a large number of Japanese naval dignitaries are on board the ship to celebrate the establishment of the puppet "government."

### Subcommittee Meeting of the French Concession Price Stabilization Committee

The Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession Municipal Council held two meetings on the 7th and 13th to review the investigation reports of the subcommittees and study the methods of suppressing prices. It has generally been decided and submitted to Mr. Baudez, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, for verification. (1) Negotiating with the Japanese side to issue procurement permits to go to the mainland, (2) organizing a grain transportation and sales general agency, and (3) negotiating with the Kailuan Mining Administration to supply cooked coal, have all been carried out step by step. However, because the market situation changes rapidly and speculation and manipulation must be prevented at any time, the work of the committee is still actively progressing and continuing to conduct investigations and present discussions. The committee held a subcommittee meeting at the French Municipal Council at 2:00 PM yesterday, discussing matters for a total of two hours. It is heard that the information collected and produced by the police department was submitted for review during the meeting, and it was decided to wait for the report from the police department of the Public Concession to be sent for reference before making a decision, and to implement various methods of suppressing prices jointly by the two concessions to reduce the burden and difficulties of the citizens.

### Chinese Absorb Spiritual Food: Over 224,000 Copies of the Bible Sold in Various Parts of China Last Year

According to the annual report of the China Bible Society, the British Bible Society, and the American Bible Society (ending December 31, 1939), as reported by the North-China Daily News, a new record of 224,282 copies of the Bible and New Testament and Old Testament were sold in various parts of China last year, an increase of 175% compared to ten years ago, and an increase of 59% compared to 1938. In December of last year, about 35,000 copies of the Bible and New and Old Testaments that had already been ordered were temporarily canceled due to soaring paper prices, which are not included in the statistics. It is truly commendable that the Chinese people are still able to sincerely absorb spiritual food during this period of arduous struggle when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood is as precious as cinnamon. Historian Heng said that the Bible and the history of European and American nations have already been integrated. According to reports from the China provincial associations, Chinese students now love to read the Bible, and this situation is even more so in free China. Thinking of this, we cannot help but ask: Will the Sino-Japanese war integrate the Bible into the lives of the Chinese people?

### Japanese Troops Collect Taxes with Bayonets, Causing High Prices; Japanese Troops Promise to Eliminate Inland Goods Taxes; If the Promise is Kept, Prices May Fall

The Continental Times reports that, according to well-informed sources, if the Japanese troops keep their promise and abolish the restrictions and taxes imposed on various products transported from the mainland to Shanghai, the solution to the high prices in this city will be in sight. Even if the Japanese authorities in this city are sincere in making this promise, it is doubtful whether it can be implemented in the short term, because the troops stationed in remote areas still act arbitrarily. The Price Stabilization Committee of the Municipal Council recently discussed with the Japanese military authorities in this city. The latter tried its best to eliminate the various taxes levied on mainland products transported to Shanghai. At this point, the Japanese side officially admitted for the first time that there were restrictions on local products transported to Shanghai. In the past, the Japanese side always denied restrictions. The Japanese army often "extorted" by collecting taxes with bayonets. This is the main reason for the extraordinarily high prices in this city. Unless these illegal restrictions are lifted, prices cannot fall. Since the various taxes are privately extorted by low-ranking officers and sentries, it seems unlikely that the orders from above will have any great effect on eliminating extortion. To make it effective, the orders must be enforced vigorously. It is doubtful whether the Japanese authorities will issue this order, because the Japanese authorities collect a lot of revenue from taxes.

### Mr. Butrick to Act as U.S. Consul

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that Mr. Gauss, the former U.S. Consul-General in Shanghai, has been appointed as the first U.S. Minister to Australia. All affairs of the U.S. Consulate General in this city, from the 6th onwards, will be temporarily handled by Mr. Butrick, the executive officer of the consulate, until the new U.S. Consul-General to Shanghai arrives from the United States. However, there is no news as to who will be appointed to the new Consul-General position. Mr. Butrick previously worked in the Far Eastern Affairs Division in Washington, D.C., and then served as an executive officer in the U.S. Consulate Generals in Hankou and Shanghai for eight years.

### Domestic Postal Rate Increase Temporarily Not Implemented

Regarding the domestic postal rate increase, a reporter from the Datong News Agency inquired with the Shanghai Postal Administration and learned that the bureau had not yet received an order from the Kunming Postal Administration as of yesterday. However, this matter must be implemented sooner or later, and it is obviously too late to say that it will be implemented on April 1. In addition, the recruitment of postal assistants by the bureau this time has seen a surge in applicants due to the permission of female participation. After this batch of postal assistants are recruited, they will be dispatched to post offices in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions.

### Mr. Allman's Talk as the Elected American Councillor of the Municipal Council: Handling the Council's Affairs Without Any Favoritism, Mr. McMichael Responded Franky to Being Defeated

Mr. Allman, the chief editor of Shen Bao and the elected American councilor of the Municipal Council, recently gave a speech that, concerning Mr. Allman's opinions on the administration of the Council, it may not be appropriate to elaborate as there is a lack of detailed understanding. He could serve the Council with a humble attitude and without any trace of prejudice. In addition, Allman did not express surprise at the success of the preliminary election, saying that this was somewhat expected. The voting on the day before yesterday ended at 5:00 PM, and the results were announced at 6:20 PM. The three vote counters worked quickly, on the one hand maintaining the confidentiality of the work, and on the other hand making great efforts to prevent dishonest votes from being cast.

The election results were very satisfactory. After the announcement of the election results, all the ballots were burned in front of the photograph of President Washington at the American Association. All ballots were sealed in numbered envelopes and then placed in sealed boxes. Before opening the ballots in public, the numbers on the envelopes were first checked against the stubs to prevent any double voting. After the counters read out the numbers on the two envelopes, the letters on the stubs were canceled, and then they continued to read on. The procedure was extremely thorough. As for Mr. McDonald's defeat, he personally did not express any displeasure because of this. According to McDonald's, there were three candidates for two seats, and of course one person would be defeated. When the reporter asked if he felt any regret, Mr. McDonald replied that he did not. The position of Municipal Council director is a heavy duty, and there is nothing to regret if I am not elected.

### Flour Sold at a Discount Again; Prices Have Not Yet Been Agreed Upon; Factories Estimate That Each Bag Must Be Thirteen Yuan; Noodle Manufacturers Advocate Twelve Yuan Per Bag; Group Purchases of Rice Can Be Released from Warehouses, and Rice Prices Are Expected to Fall

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a joint meeting of treasurers was held at No. 59 Hong Kong Road to raise funds and withdraw foreign rice. Li Wenjie, Xi Yushu, Lu Gaoyi, Hu Yongqi, Chen Jisheng attended. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the association has raised more than 100,000 yuan through private credit loans in recent days. Among them, Yu Qiaqing, the chairman of the association, recognized a loan of 50,000 yuan, and Guo Shun, the executive director of the association, recognized a loan of 60,000 yuan. The remaining amount was also enthusiastically recognized by others. Therefore, although the amount of the funds reached 1 million yuan, with the active planning of the responsible authorities, it is not difficult to raise the full amount in the shortest period of time. At that time, the foreign rice stored in the warehouses will be released one after another to adjust the people's food, and the rice prices in Shanghai are expected to continue to fall.

Prices of Discounted Noodles Have Not Yet Been Agreed Upon. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, noodle manufacturers sent five representatives, Wang Jinwen, Wang Fuxin, Zhu Zhenfang, Cang Guofeng, and Li Bangkun, to meet with Deputy Director He of the Municipal Council. Mr. He received them and reported on the progress of the discussions with the factories on the sale of discounted flour. It is said that, due to cost reasons, the factories insisted on the amount of thirteen yuan per bag. The representatives said that the price of recycled flour on the market is only 13.2 yuan per bag. The price difference of the discounted flour from that on the market is minimal, which is of minimal value. It was requested that the price of discounted flour be limited to 12 yuan per bag. Mr. He, with the people's food at stake, will immediately contact the factories again at a price of 12 yuan a bag. Therefore, the reply from yesterday has not been received yet.

Many Suggestions for Selling at Discounted Prices. Since the prices of rice and grain soared, flour has become the main food for tens of thousands of civilians in the city. Eating noodles is simpler than eating rice. For just a dime or two, one can purchase it. Therefore, the most urgent way to solve the food problem in this city is to sell flour at a discount. Selling flour at a discount was held last month, but because the minimum unit for purchase was one bag, the general public still could not benefit from it. At this time when wood prices have not fallen and flour prices are rising again, social figures have expressed many suggestions in light of the lack of a clear path for the people's food future. They requested that the authorities hold the sale of discounted flour again. The solution is to divide each bag of No. 4 flour into four small bags, and the price is also calculated as one-fourth of the price of each bag. In this way, the poor can afford to buy it, and the sale can achieve a universal effect.

### Shanghai Market: Population Tax Reduction; Total Population Below Four Million; Goods Supply Gradually Balancing

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, people from the mainland flocked to Shanghai for refuge. At its peak, the total population reached over 5.5 million. However, due to the continuous rise in commodity prices and the manifold increase in the cost of daily necessities, those who came to Shanghai from the mainland have mostly returned to their hometowns. According to surveys and statistics, the recent return of people to their homes has caused Shanghai's population to drop to 3.89 million. As a result, the supply of various goods is gradually becoming balanced, and the speculative atmosphere may be curbed.

### Inheritance Tax to Be Levied Starting July 1st; Collection Agency to Establish Evaluation Committee; Temporarily Handled by Income Tax Office

Inheritance tax is an important backbone of the direct tax system. The proposal to establish it dates back to the fourth year of the Republic (1915). Now, the Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules have been promulgated by the National Government one after another and will be uniformly implemented nationwide starting July 1st. All forms required for collection have been agreed upon. Inheritance Evaluation Committees will be established in various locations. Details are recorded as follows:

Instructions for Filling Out Forms for Tax-Exempt Amounts

The Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations stipulate that anyone who leaves property within the territory of China at the time of death shall pay inheritance tax in accordance with the regulations. Citizens of the Republic of China who have a domicile within the national territory but have property abroad shall also be taxed. The inheritance tax is levied on the heirs and legatees of the estate. Estates with a total value of less than 5,000 yuan are exempt from inheritance tax. The deceased's successor should fill out a report form in the prescribed format, stating: (1) the name and address of the deceased; (2) the place where the inheritance began; (3) the date on which the inheritance began; (4) the date of the last inheritance; (5) the estimated amount of the main inheritance and its location; (6) when the successor has analyzed or donated his property within three years before the commencement of the inheritance, the value of the property and the name and address of the property successor or donee; (7) the name and address of the reporter, or his residence if he has no domicile. If the reporter is the estate administrator or the executor of the omission, the date of his appointment and the name and address of the taxpayer shall be stated.

Establishment of Evaluation Committee for Handling

The collection of inheritance tax is temporarily entrusted to the Income Tax Office. Local inheritance tax collection agencies will establish Inheritance Evaluation Committees. Each committee will consist of five to seven members. In addition to one representative from the inheritance tax collection agency serving as an ex officio member, the Ministry of Finance will appoint members from the following local candidates: (1) judicial organs; (2) land administration or civil affairs agencies; (3) education or cultural agencies; (4) local financial agencies; (5) local self-government agencies or organizations; (6) local impartial individuals. Evaluation committee members will serve without pay for a term of three years. Evaluation committee members may not participate in the evaluation of inheritances for themselves or their spouses, blood relatives within the fifth degree, or relatives by marriage within the third degree.

### Reasons for Exchange Rate Fluctuations; Trade Deficit at Jianghai Customs Increasing; Future Changes Cannot Yet Be Predicted

Since Easter, gold prices have soared and foreign exchange has shrunk, similar to the situation at the opening of the previous year. According to the investigation by the Datong News Agency reporter, the soaring gold prices and the fall of the British pound, as well as the manipulation of speculators, are certainly factors, but trade and the political situation are also related. Recently, Shanghai Customs' foreign trade shows a surplus on the surface (the Customs calculates the value of imported national currency using the gold unit exchange rate of the Central Bank, which differs greatly from the official market exchange rate), but in reality, it is a deficit, although much improved compared to last year. For example, in January of this year,

Shanghai Customs' deficit was only equivalent to over 90,000 US dollars. By February, the sales of raw silk to Britain and France had decreased, and the Indian market for cotton yarn and cotton cloth had also been hit. Exports declined, while imports of goods such as cotton, rice, and coal increased. Therefore, it is rumored that Shanghai Customs' trade deficit in February was actually 6.2 million US dollars. Under the uneasy exchange market, this trend of trade difference will naturally weaken the exchange rate. Recently, the establishment of the Nanjing puppet "regime" has attempted to issue banknotes and disrupt the legal currency. Those with superficial views are inevitably affected. However, according to another message,

Shanghai's US dollar notes are estimated to be about 30 million US dollars, certainly exceeding demand. The reason for its strong market is nothing more than speculative manipulation and control of the market. As for the relationship between the puppet "regime" and the financial community, the business community has inconsistent views, and some even see it as a sign that the legal currency will improve. Therefore, future changes in the exchange market cannot be predicted.

### One Check Missing from Checkbook; Bank Clerk Suspected and Interrogated; Later Discovered That the Check Had Been Cashed; Chen Renhao Arrested and Ordered to Summon Witnesses for Further Interrogation

On December 30th of last year, Yuchanglong Company, No. 270 Kang Nao Road, opened a current account at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank on Beijing Road. However, after the company received the checkbook, it discovered that one check, No. 853069, was missing. It immediately reported the loss to the bank. On February 7th of this year, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank received more than 1,000 checks from the mountain bill exchange. That day happened to be

the end of the lunar year, and the accounts were extremely busy. At that time, the bank clerks sorted the received checks into categories, sent them to the respective departments for verification, and then sent them to the accounting department. However, the accounting department did not check the total number that day. The bank followed the custom of closing for four days during the Lunar New Year. When it reopened on February 12th, the accounting department discovered that one check was missing, totaling 27,000 yuan. After detailed investigation, it was learned that the check belonged to Yuchanglong's

lost check, which was submitted by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. The Zhejiang Industrial Bank was deposited by the customer Xintaihe Company. When Zhejiang Xingye Bank notified Zhejiang Shishi to stop payment on February 14th, the 27,000 yuan had already been withdrawn by Xintai on February 12th and 13th. If Zhejiang Shishi had stopped payment, then this amount would not have been withdrawn by Xintai. Afterwards, Zhejiang Xingye reported to the General Patrol Room. After investigation by Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng, it was learned that the so-called Xintaihe Company

did not exist and was a fictitious creation, clearly an organized event. After comparing the handwriting, it was found that the handwriting of Chen Renhao, the seal verification clerk in the bank's current deposit department, was slightly similar to that on the checks opened by Xintaihe. It was suspected that Chen was responsible, and he was arrested and sent to the First Special Court. He was granted bail of 8,000 yuan and the hearing was postponed. Yesterday, Judge Tian Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court held a hearing. The patrol room lawyer Ru Bao Yi prosecuted for forgery and fraud. Zhejiang Xingye Bank also hired lawyer Tang Mingshi to file a related civil lawsuit. Chen Renhao hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to defend him. His

main point was that the handwriting of those who practiced calligraphy in our country was roughly the same, especially with fountain pens. Moreover, this matter required the hands of many people and could not be done by one person alone. Furthermore, the incident that occurred on February 7th was not discovered until the 14th, and the money had already been withdrawn before the discovery. How could a clerk in the defendant's position have such skills? Moreover, the defendant had served for more than ten years and had never made a mistake, etc. Judge Qian then interrogated all relevant witnesses once. Because further investigation was needed, he ordered the hearing to be postponed.

### Accomplice in Liu Zhongying Shooting Sentenced to Six Years in Prison

The plaintiff, Liu Zhongying's wife, Chen, hired a lawyer to file a related civil lawsuit, demanding compensation of 90,720 yuan for living expenses. After the debate was concluded, the verdict was awaited. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu came to the Third Criminal Court to pronounce the verdict. Xiao Yonglin was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for joint murder as a warning. The guns and bullets were confiscated. The related civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court.

Because they saw each other day and night, they gradually fell in love. The two had a relationship at the Xiaokezhan Inn on Baylor Road in May of last year. Afterwards, they continued to commit adultery many times. After the case was exposed, they were arrested and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Shent concluded the trial and sentenced Su Fuguang to six months of imprisonment for adultery, suspended for two years.

Wang secretly deposited the money into the China Industrial Bank and disappeared without returning to the shop. Wang Yongliang reported it to the patrol room. Wang Zixuan was arrested until the day before yesterday. He was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday. The defendant admitted to embezzlement. The court ordered him to be detained and postponed the hearing for further verification.

Because the sick child was very ill, the hospital immediately admitted him for treatment. However, after he recovered, it has been more than a month, and his parents have never come to visit or take him back. The hospital hopes that his parents will not give up on their child. If they still do not come to pick him up within two weeks, the hospital will have to arrange for the child to be placed and sever the parent-child relationship.

### Great Fire at Jardine Matheson Warehouse; Huge Quantities of Cotton and Silk Cocoons Destroyed; Enormous Losses; Cause of Fire Unknown

At 9:27 last night, a fire broke out at the Jardine Matheson Warehouse located on the east side of the Old Garbage Bridge on North Suzhou Road and North Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession. Immediately, black smoke billowed and flames soared. Upon receiving the report, the Central Fire Brigade rushed many pump trucks to the scene to connect water for firefighting. However, the goods stored in the warehouse were all cotton, silk cocoons, and Huzhou silk, which are not easy to extinguish once they catch fire. When reporters rushed to investigate, they saw the fire illuminating the sky, breaking through the roof. Many firefighters climbed ladders six or seven feet high or crossed the roofs of neighboring houses to try to put out the fire. However, the fire spread rapidly and could not be extinguished for a while. In addition, the wind aided the fire, and sparks spread everywhere. As of this morning when this newspaper went to press, the fire was still spreading. It is estimated that the losses in this fire are no less than several hundred thousand. It is said that they are all insured.

### Bank Employee Embezzles Funds and Flees; Incident Occurred Before Tomb Sweeping Festival Closure; Amount Was 2,800 US Dollars

Pingming News Agency reported that a bank in this city, known for its stability, suddenly discovered that an employee had embezzled funds and fled, which was unexpected. According to the interview by the Pingming News Agency reporter, a warehouse employee, Zhou, had worked in the bank for more than ten years, was cautious, and had no faults. Moreover, he was very strict with himself and had no bad habits. Therefore, the bank also held his savings. No one suspected that he would do anything unexpected. Unexpectedly, after the Tomb Sweeping Festival closure, he did not ask for leave and suddenly disappeared without a trace. Employees were sent to visit his home, but he was gone. An urgent check of the warehouse revealed that 2,800 US dollar notes (equivalent to more than 40,000 legal currency) were missing. The reporter inquired with the bank. At first, they said that nothing had happened. Then they said that there was no such large amount of US dollars. Later, they inquired with a well-respected bank president in the same industry, who said that this was indeed the case, but the amount was 2,800 US dollars and not the rumored 270,000 US dollars.

Xin Sheng News Agency reported that a certain evening newspaper published that a warehouse employee of a certain bank embezzled and fled with 270,000 US dollars, equivalent to more than 4 million legal currency. After investigation by reporters, the accurate information is that it was actually 2,700 US dollar notes, equivalent to more than 40,000 legal currency.

### Refereeing Errors in the International Cup Final: Chinese Team Lodges Protest. Manager Li Jun Signed and Delivered to the Western Union Yesterday. The Appeals Committee is Scheduled to Convene Tomorrow for a Judgement.

In the final of this year's International Cup football match between the Chinese team and Portugal, the referee Pan Tuo was partial, deliberately biased, and abused his power. When Meng Yiliang, the central defender of the Portuguese team, indulgently committed a fierce foul, he wrongly penalized innocent players, reversing right and wrong, causing the Chinese team to lose a penalty kick. Nearly 20,000 spectators in the stands were in an uproar, but Pan Tuo turned a deaf ear. Sun Jinshun, the captain of the Chinese team, lodged a verbal protest on the spot, which was also ineffective. The Chinese team ultimately lost the championship by a score of 2-3 due to the loss of this goal. The next day, Chinese and Western newspapers unanimously criticized the incident, because the facts were obvious and Pan Tuo could not cover up the eyes and ears of the world. The dignity of the referee was completely lost. According to the situation on that day, the Chinese team pointed out that Pan Tuo was negligent in his duties. The secretary of the association, Shi Bike, heard that the appeals committee of the association had scheduled a meeting for tomorrow to make a fair judgement. The committee should be able to accept public opinion based on the facts and decide on remedial measures. Otherwise, the national competition will be a laughing stock at home and abroad due to the referee's dereliction of duty.

### Finance: Sharp Drop in US-British Exchange Rates of Over One Jiao and Four Fen. Shanghai US Dollar Exchange Rate Sets Tightest Record. Spot and Forward Rates Diverge, Almost Reaching 3.75.

The foreign exchange market yesterday was affected by the overseas exchange rate of US against British currency, which plummeted by one jiao, four fen and eight hundred seventy-five thousandths, so the HSBC US dollar exchange rate in this city was reduced by one hundred twenty-five thousandths. The Dutch, Ryukyu, and Japanese exchange rates also followed suit, while other exchange rates such as the British exchange rate were stable. As for the domestic situation, the market was tight first and then declined, with unprecedented changes. The continued decline in the US-British exchange rate in the early morning was beyond the expectations of most operators, resulting in a situation where the British exchange rate was stable and the US exchange rate was reduced. The US dollar exchange rate immediately saw 6.0625 yuan, which broke the tightest record of 6.1875 yuan on August 11 last year, but it was only a flash in the pan. The US dollar exchange rate for April was even tighter, with the price once bid up to 5.6875 yuan at the opening, with a difference of almost 3.75 from the spot price, but there was only a price and no market (if arbitrage were carried out at this price, a huge profit of 6.7% could be obtained). However, due to the sudden blocking by speculators, the market sentiment hardened invisibly, and foreign firms were more willing to sell than before. Everyone believed that the exchange rate could rebound, so the potential gradually relaxed, and the dumping by foreign firms and speculators did not stop. At that time, the US dollar exchange rate for April had reached 6 yuan, and British gold was also at 4 office shillings. The spot US dollar exchange rate of 6.1875 yuan was relatively easy to close. As such, the market closed calmly at noon. As a result, the British exchange rate was stable and the US exchange rate was tight by 0.03125. There were quite a few people doing arbitrage today, with a profit of about 0.1% to 0.26%.

Exchange Rates Will Rise Today

In the early morning, London's large bar was recently down 0.0625, the far end was reduced by 0.05625, New York silver prices were still flat, London gold prices were stagnant, the exchange rates of British, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat, the US dollar against the British currency plummeted by one jiao, four fen and eight hundred seventy-five thousandths, and the US dollar against Shanghai dropped by one jiao, and the US dollar against France plummeted by eight fen and six hundred twenty-five thousandths. The central exchange rate was as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 office shillings and 0.125 for British gold, and 6.0625 yuan for the US dollar, which was due to the further decline in the British-US exchange rate. At the same time, the US dollar exchange rate for April was priced at 5.6875 yuan, with a difference of 3.75 from the spot price. After the opening, speculators first sold, and the market immediately eased. It is estimated that foreign firms absorbed the US dollar exchange rate for April at 5.8125 yuan and 0.875 from speculators. Later, foreign firms also sold British gold at 3 office shillings and 0.9375 and 0.96875 to Sassoon for April. Before long, HSBC announced the exchange rate, with the British exchange rate stable and the US dollar exchange rate reduced by 0.03125. The balance tax for silver was reduced by a small amount of 0.0035. After that, speculators generally turned bullish on exchange rates, so they mostly bought British currency and sold US dollars. The potential continued to relax. It is estimated that speculators sold the US dollar exchange rate for April to foreign firms from 5.9375 yuan to 6 yuan, and foreign firms, Datong Bank, and HSBC stuffed British gold at 4 office shillings to speculators. At this time, the spot US dollar exchange rate of 6.1875 yuan could be settled at one time. At noon, HSBC suddenly took the opportunity to absorb it, so the situation gradually stabilized. It is estimated that it once ate the US dollar exchange rate for the current month at 6.0125 yuan and extended it to the noon closing. British gold was 4 office shillings and 0.125, the US dollar was 6.015625, and the British order for this month was 4 office shillings and 0.109375, and the US dollar was 6.0125. The British gold in April was 4 office shillings, and the US dollar was 5.9375. As a result, compared with the previous day, the spot British gold was stable and the US dollar was tight by 0.03125, the British currency for this month was loose by 0.046875, the US dollar was soft by 0.03125, the British currency for April was long by 0.078125, and the US dollar was cheap by 0.03125. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

### Black Market US Dollar Very Tight. Gold Prices Rise and Then Suddenly Reverse. Although a Peak of 5,450 Yuan Was Seen, the Bulls Were Unable to Continue Holding and Turned to Selling for Profit.

Yesterday's cash black market situation, although the closing price was 12 yuan lower than the previous day, the initial soaring was endless, setting new gold price records, with a peak of 5,450 yuan. The morning opening saw the US-British exchange rate falling sharply again, and the near and far-term US dollar exchange rates tightened consistently. Sentiment was extremely enthusiastic, and gold firms bought aggressively, jumping 70 yuan to 5,440 yuan. Before long, although currency dealers sold some, falling slightly by 25 yuan, it only increased the prevalence of buying. Gold firms and others entered the market to search for goods, and suddenly the chips were not enough to grab, and 5,450 yuan was seen. Who knew that it was rumored that foreign firms such as HSBC would refuse to make new gold mortgages and would accelerate the recovery of loans that had already been issued, which affected general trading, and those involved were even more eager to sell without hesitation, and the profit-taking retail investors came out at high prices, which the exchange was happy to see. Soon, it fell sharply. Furthermore, sentiment on the exchange rate market was bullish before the close, resulting in a small loss of 12 yuan, to 5,358 yuan, which was also rare. Due to the strong trading in the morning (about 4,000 taels and above), the clearing was time-consuming, so the industry decided to suspend the market as a special case. It was heard that there was no trading outside the market, and the prices also lacked changes. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops once reached a high of 545 yuan, but finally returned to flat, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous day. Customs gold and other items were still flat.

Cash Fell Slightly by 12 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial exchange rate was reduced by more than one jiao, the black market US dollar was extremely tight, sentiment rebounded again, and there was a chorus of buying. The opening immediately raised 70 yuan, and the gold firm bought 50 taels from the silver shop, for 5,440 yuan. Later, some currency dealers sold their long positions, immediately falling back 25 yuan, and the cash firm sold 50 taels to the silver shop, for 5,415 yuan. Taking into account that a certain gold firm came to grab wildly again, it rose again by 35 yuan, and the gold firm bought 20 taels from the currency dealer, for 5,450 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate turned hard, and it was heard that foreign banks such as HSBC were urging the redemption of mortgages, and sentiment immediately turned downward. The floating crowd rose up to exit, and even more large households and currency dealers tended to sell their loan goods. Soon, it fell sharply by 100 yuan, and the cash firm sold 50 taels to the silver shop, for 5,350 yuan. The silver shop suddenly took the opportunity to drag it up sharply, and at the same time, gold firms and currency dealers also rushed to buy it back, raising it again by 70 yuan. The silver shop bought 50 taels from the currency dealer, for 5,420 yuan. In the end, because the foreign exchange rate still reported a rebound, there were fewer and fewer buyers following the trend, and on the contrary, more and more people sold for profit, finally falling back by 65 yuan. The silver shop sold 50 taels to the currency dealer, for 5,355 yuan. Subsequently, the silver shops did 50 taels of mutual trading for 5,358 yuan as the noon closing price. As a result, it fell back 12 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of cash firm's own brand gold sold was several yuan higher than the black market price, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The cash price was more than 50 yuan lower than the posted price, and there was little trading.

Gold Jewelry Returned to Flat After Rising

The initial price of gold jewelry sold per tael in silver shops was still 540 yuan at Datonghang. It rose by 5 yuan at 9:30, fell back by 5 yuan at 10:20, and rose again by 5 yuan after 11 o'clock. At noon at 12 o'clock, it returned to 5 yuan lower again. There were no changes after that. As a result, it was flat. The Datonghang was still at 540 yuan. The new banks had the same price as above, and the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### American Dollars Rose and Fell Sharply. The Difference Between the High and Low for the Whole Day Was 5 Jiao.

Yesterday's foreign currency market was unpredictable. Initially, due to the continued sharp fall in the pound price, the black market US dollar exchange rate broke the tightest price on August 11 last year and found a new tight price of 6.0625 yuan, which was unprecedented. As a result, the US dollar bill suddenly rose to 16 yuan and 6 jiao. Later, because everyone generally believed that the pound price would turn around today, speculators scrambled to sell US dollars, and the US dollar bill followed suit, falling back to 16 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen at noon, and further falling to 16 yuan and 1 jiao in the afternoon. The British gold bill fell first and then returned to flat. The British, American, and gold pound rose sharply with the gold price first, and then fell accordingly. The Hong Kong bill was slightly weaker following the Hong Kong exchange rate. The supply of Singapore bills, Canadian bills, Robbie bills, and others was not weak. The Dutch bill trended stronger due to HSBC's exchange rate reducing by another one-half. The supply of Japanese gold bills was still large, and the evening market retreated to 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 0.006. The trend of Korean bills was still strong, and the evening market was 1 yuan. Yesterday's market prices were: the British, American, and gold pound each fell by 5 jiao, the US dollar bill fell by 5 fen, the Hong Kong bill fell by 1 fen, Singapore and Canadian bills both fell by 2 jiao, the Robbie bill fell by 1 jiao and a half, and the Dutch bill rose by 1 jiao. The rest were unremarkable.

### Food: Foreign Rice Jumps Over Two Yuan at Once. Wuxi Rice Market to Watch Japanese Movements. Shanghai Foreign Rice Rises Back Six or Seven Yuan. Over 90,000 Bags of Australian Wheat Will Arrive in Shanghai.

Since the rice market turned from falling to rising within this week, it has been rising every day. Yesterday, it continued to show a surprising rise, and the prices of various foreign rice increased by more than two yuan. Although the thousand-market slightly recovered, compared to the price of 37-38 yuan when it was low in the previous week, it has risen by as much as 6-7 yuan within this week, indicating the drastic changes in rice prices. The reason for this rice price rebound is that the large batch of futures for this month has been cleared after a small-scale rush, so the source of foreign rice suddenly became scarce. Although the futures for the next month (i.e., April) will be shipped again next month, it will still take at least ten days at the fastest, and the number is less than half of the amount for this month, only about 200,000 bags. It is also heard that no renewals have been made for May, so the arrival of the later batch can be estimated. As a result, all spot owners have no intention of selling quickly. The goods in the hands of the current travelers were cut sharply at the time of the previous sharp fall for fear of suffering a great loss. The stores' reserves were also dry due to the repeated downstream movement of the market in the past, with more sales than purchases. Sellers did not sell, buyers thought of buying, and a change in market sentiment has formed. Therefore, yesterday morning, driven by this environment, the local stores asked prices from each other at the beginning of the market, and they competed to search for goods. Under the bullish sentiment of merchants, the market rose by one yuan immediately. No. 1 Saigon was sold for 42.5 yuan, and then more inland merchants entered the market one after another, and the situation became more bullish. The shout-outs rose one after another, and the market rose step by step. By the time the prices of various goods in the middle market seemed to climb the stairs, increasing to about 2.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon was sold for 44 yuan, No. 2 for 40 yuan and 5 jiao, fire-twisted rice for 42 yuan, special Micro Party for 43 yuan, small twisted rice for 39 yuan and 7 jiao, No. 2 retired dimension for 40 yuan, and Tokyo sharp tip for 40 yuan. After this peak, it was inevitably too much of a shock, and the sales market gradually slackened. Until the noon market, the prices of various foreign rice fell back by half a yuan, which was actually about two yuan more than the previous market. For the rest, such as japonica, glutinous, and national rice, the arrival of goods from Hongkou was scarce, only more than 1,000 bags, and the sales were good. The market price was 20 yuan, and it was heard that the off-market prices for thick and thin japonica were 46-47 yuan for Kunxi japonica, 46 yuan for Qingzi special thin, 45 yuan for the bulk market, and 44-45 yuan for Nanhang early and late rice.

Following the upward trend of the previous day's rebound in foreign rice, the price soared, and it was difficult to approach. The Chinese and foreign traders had little stock and were unwilling to sell easily with the increasing price. Currently, No. 1 Saigon has risen all the way from 42 yuan to 44 yuan, which is about 2.5 yuan higher than the previous day. Other rice flours have also followed suit, rising by more than 1 yuan and 2-3 yuan respectively. The original package price of futures was also increased by more than 1 yuan. The initial opening price of No. 1 Saigon was 50.5 yuan, then to 51 yuan, and No. 2 was from 48 yuan to 48.5 yuan. Mizuluo was from 44 yuan to 44.3 yuan, but in the afternoon, floating loose customers took advantage of the high price to sell, and the original package of No. 2 fell by half a yuan first. Other rice was also shouted down by 5-6 jiao to 1 yuan, which is due to the current abundance of foreign rice stocks, the small arrival of new goods, and the rumors of the opening of national rice, so the hearts of people inside and outside the industry are not stable. However, the transaction was quite good yesterday, with more than 8,000 bags of current rice and more than 700 tons of futures.

Wuxi's Jiaojin rice market has stopped selling Pingmi, and the source is quite abundant. The owners' thoughts have turned firm, and most of them are going to the warehouse and waiting for a price to sell. The market has slightly entered into the Japanese traders' purchases, and has also caused a small number of traders to purchase in succession, which is very concentrated, resulting in a demand that exceeds the supply. The price of rice and rice has tightened, and the price of high white japonica has risen from 25.35 yuan per stone to 26.35 yuan. The market price on the 26th has reached about 27 yuan, and the price has risen by more than one yuan in the past three days. The price of coarse japonica has reached more than 25 yuan, and the price of japonica rice has reached more than 13 yuan. The situation depends entirely on the movements of the Japanese traders. If they continue to purchase continuously, it will soon reach a high price of 30 yuan.

A large amount of foreign rice can arrive today. The previous newspaper has reported that the manager of Java Company's Aagen Sacher (transliteration) is shipping 35,000 bags of rice from Rangoon to Shanghai. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but was later changed to tomorrow (the 29th). It is now known that it can be imported this morning and is scheduled to stop at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Today, 4,000 bags of foreign rice and more than 5,000 bags of corn will be transported to Yantai. It is also heard that a large batch of Australian wheat will arrive in Shanghai. It is loaded on the Bellng (transliteration) ship managed by the head of the foreign ship of Qiahe Foreign Company, totaling 9,200 tons, which is about 92,000 bags. It is said that it is loaded in bulk, not in bags, and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month.

### Flour and Wheat Both Turn Stable. Xiyi Flour Prices Rise.

Flour: The market gradually stabilized yesterday. The price of No. 2 flour mill has been fixed at 13.8 yuan, and it is unlikely to change for a while. The willingness to sell in various mills is still good, so the customer price of Green Cannonball brand is still at a high of 15 yuan, but the customer demand is flat and there are not many transactions. The recycled flour of Lao Cannonball brand is trading at 13.66 yuan, which is slightly tighter than before. In the environment of expensive gold and reduced exchange rates, those who hold goods intend to hold on to it, so the market is likely to brew again.

Wheat: The market has also stabilized. Due to the continuous rise in gold and reduction in exchange rates, the price of foreign wheat is high, and the owners intend to raise prices, but the intake of various factories is normal and there are few inquiries from customers, so the market has been stagnant. It is heard that more than 1,000 bags of Su, Chang and other wheat have been traded in the after-market, and the selling price has not changed significantly.

Wuxi: The wheat stock is low and the source is scarce, which has become the tail end. It once fell to 32.35 yuan. The market on the previous day was short of samples, and the price of each bag rose by 1 yuan. Flour mills and retail investors traded to the 34 yuan mark. The price of flour in the previous few days was as low as 11.7-8 yuan per bag, and some Shanghai retail customers moved to raise the price to 12.3-4 yuan. The price of period flour has reached 12.6-7 yuan, which is 5-6 jiao higher than before.

### Securities: Jardine Matheson's Dividend Unexpected. Domestic Debt Actively Resurfaces.

Securities Black Market: Yesterday, the market rose sharply, so there were quite a few rumors. In practice, it was completely raised by covering short positions. Furthermore, with the approach of the Category C lottery, no one dared to take risks and buy back. The so-called issuance of treasury bills and government bonds is actually meaningless. In the current high tide of gold and foreign exchange, coupled with increasingly rampant rumors, such an unexpected rise in government bonds is inevitable to create opportunities for short sellers. Yesterday morning, Lianhe continued to cover short positions, and Changji also bought in quite enthusiastically. Nos. 14 and 41, as well as Dada, all had inflows, either covering short positions or searching for goods. Although Jiu Feng, Heng Tai, Wu Yuan, Yongkang, and others continued to sell, Category C penetrated the 9 yuan mark again. In the afternoon, Lianyi continued to hedge, Wu Yuan recovered again, and Tongsheng, Tiansheng, Lianyi, and others all had inflows. Xingyuan, Yitai, Tongkang, and other items were sold, and the market price rose again. Category E also penetrated the 9 yuan mark. As a result, it rose 0.3-0.6 yuan compared to the previous day, and the turnover was about 1.1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 500 shares of Tianyuan Caustic Soda Factory were traded at a price of 50 yuan.

Yesterday, at the Public Securities Exchange, near the closing of the market, it was heard that Jardine Matheson announced a final dividend of 4 yuan per share (totaling 5 yuan including the previous interim dividend of 1 yuan), and the public's interest was almost concentrated on this point, and there was a general disregard for other items. This dividend exceeded the speculation of the general public, so the stock rose instantly, rising from a price of 44.25 yuan to 45.5 yuan. Although there were also many people who took profits in the meantime, the price finally stabilized, but due to the short time, the public obviously had no time to estimate the true value of this interest for the stock, otherwise its activity would be more than this. The general market situation was stable and the prices were stable. The trend of China Reclamation stocks was active, and the operators are also paying close attention to this. Rubber stocks were quiet, and Ranggezhi had more trading.

### Yarn and Cotton: Coarse Yarn Spring Sales Begin.

Current Yarn Morning Opening: Due to the sharp reduction in British and American exchange rates, sentiment was enthusiastic. The price of 20s Double Horse yarn for this month was 1,038 yuan, and the price for April was 1,050 yuan, rising directly to 1,060 yuan. Midway, because it had risen a lot in these few days, profit-takers came out, and it fell back by more than ten yuan, but the amount absorbed by the outside industry was still unwilling to give up. The turnover statistics for half a day totaled 2,563 bales. The market price of 20s Double Horse spot increased by 21 yuan. The amount purchased by various gangs is listed as follows: Same Industry 2,060 Hong Kong 48 Mainland 120 Statistics 2,563

### Cotton Prices Also Rise by Two Yuan.

The cotton trade continued to be active. Due to the good yarn market and the sharp reduction in foreign exchange rates, the same industry's sentiment was slightly firm. However, due to the tight money supply, the cotton market could not rise as much as the yarn market. The factories were also not buying much, but some factories were swapping yarn and cotton with cotton numbers, so the market turnover was not reported. Cotton prices rose by 1-2 yuan compared to the previous day. The current cotton situation is listed on the left: General bale 214.00 213.00 Same Industry purchased 315 pieces of Beita 212.00 Xinsheng purchased 500 bales of Grass bale 196.50 Same Industry purchased 187 bales of Fire Bale 204.20 Same Industry purchased 187 pieces of Pingguoer 187.00 Same Industry purchased 100 pieces of General bale 213.00 212.00 Chengfu purchased 200 pieces of Hai Huo Ji 207.00 Same Industry purchased 100 pieces of Donggou bale 204.00 Same Industry purchased 119 pieces of Beita 210.00 Same Industry purchased 400 bales of Da Zhonghua 228.00 Same Industry purchased 120 bales

Another Message: Foreign cotton market prices. The New York cotton market opened soft yesterday morning due to the drop in Liverpool's electricity newspaper, and then continued to fall due to the in-market covering sales of Southern gangs and the sales of overseas cotton traders. As a result, the closing price was 13-14 pounds of sound for the near-term and 20 pounds of sound for the far-term. The Indian cotton market fell again yesterday, with a forecast decline of 6 rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 20 pounds of sound.

### Market Situation Summary

Recently, the soybean market has appeared active in terms of trading activity. Although the overall situation is stable, prices have quietly eased quite a bit. Yesterday, Xiamen-based oil mills and others inquired about high-quality soybeans, which helped keep prices at their original levels. Medium and lower grades, however, inevitably suffered price cuts, falling by five or six cents compared to the previous day. Transactions included 150 bags of Nanjing beans at $20, three cartloads of Bengbu beans at $23 to $22.80, 130 bags of Anqing beans at $22.50, and over 800 bags of Wuhu beans at prices ranging from $24 to $21.

Yesterday, the oil market remained sluggish, with prices continuing to fall by $2.50. Overall, prices at the place of origin have dropped, and local inventories are quite high, leading to a pessimistic outlook. The scope of trading in the market was limited, making it difficult to generate interest. Only 250 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at $110 to $109.50, 20 barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil at $107.50, and 300 pieces of Yantai soybean oil at $76.

### Old News Re-Copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (337) (See the Shenbao of the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi of the Late Qing Dynasty)

Distinguishing the Way of the Gods (2)

The way of the gods is distant, while the way of humans is near. If drought persists for several years, the gods of the state should certainly be responsive. There's no need to pray to them. Praying at the Temple of Guan Yu suggests that a great god possesses great virtue and can turn a great heart to save the people. However, the people of Jin should not all have to die. Rainfall will come without prayer. If the people of Jin are destined to perish, what can even Guan Yu do? Given Guan Yu's holiness and ability to assist in the transformations of Heaven and Earth, he should summon the Rain Master to bestow abundant moisture, ensuring a successful harvest for the spring wheat. If rain only comes after prayer, isn't this using the divine power to seek the glory of a plaque? This is a grave slander. The celestial realm is clear and empty, the Earth rotates, and rain, sunshine, wind, and dew are all produced by air. Heaven has no intention of causing disasters, and the gods have no merit in bringing rain. However, the timing of Heaven is rooted in human affairs, and the saying "harmony brings auspiciousness" may have some basis. If there is good governance above and good customs below, harmony will lead to timely rain and wind. Therefore, relying on the way of the gods is illogical, while relying on human effort has a certain principle. When the Governor of Zhili entered Shanxi, the disaster was already established and impossible to reverse. To this day, the original officials still don't know to blame themselves and even embezzle disaster relief funds to enrich their families. One can only imagine the usual governance, education, orders, and commands. Attributing human wrongdoing to Heaven is like saying the gods are aware and send down sweet rain. This uses the gods as an excuse, and the cause of the disaster can also be blamed on celestial changes. However, many people are foolish, and those in power use divine gifts to confuse them, making them fear divine might and strive to be good. This is a subtle tactic of governance. But those in power should not entirely rely on the gods and excuse their own faults. In discussing this, I do not dare to consider the way of the gods as empty or the worship of gods as absurd. If one carefully examines the principles, one should recognize that my words are not intended to be unconventional.

Family

### The New Family

— De Fu

The family is the earliest form of social organization for mankind. It arises naturally based on basic and shared human needs. Later, ethics and laws respecting the family merely officially acknowledged a fact with great influence. Because the family did not wait for artificial help to appear.

Family relationships, except for a very few unfortunate individuals, are simply a stage that everyone must go through in life. If someone loses their parents at a young age, has no siblings, and does not marry in adulthood, they have never enjoyed the happiness of a family. That is truly a great regret in life. If someone goes through the family stage but does not know how to derive the happiness they should, that can be considered a tragedy in life.

Now, the large family system is gradually collapsing due to changes in the social environment. Almost all young people living in cities practice small family life. As a result, a very common misconception has arisen in society that the center of a small family is the couple. In fact, this is not the case. Families, whether large or small, new or old, should be centered on children. Couples are merely the starting point of the family. If we do not recognize this goal, we will easily fall into selfishness. We will not only neglect the highest task of the family but may also lose the happiness of the family. Walter Lippmann put it well: "The love between a couple cannot last if they cannot jointly love many other things besides loving each other." In other words, the love between a couple is maintained by common interests. The more common interests, the better. The greatest common interest is the parental love, and the children's innocence and purity give parents a lot of spiritual comfort. Even some families on the verge of breaking up are maintained by the loveliness of their children. Then, the children are truly worthy of being the center of the small family.

For a family centered on children, the primary task is to allow the children to gain the experience of love. Parents must first respect and love each other. Even if they sometimes disagree, they should not conflict in front of their children. They must ensure that the children learn the example of love from their parents' behavior. Secondly, parents—especially fathers—must set aside a certain amount of time to give directly to their children. During this time, they can participate in various aspects of their lives. They can be close companions in games, reading, and friendships without the slightest sense of separation. In addition, parents should not easily scold or reprimand their children. Even if they make mistakes, they should not be disciplined in front of others, which would hurt their self-esteem. They should only explain their mistakes in a calm manner after their anger has subsided and give them warnings.

Although children occupy the central position in the family, they should not be considered the ultimate goal of the family. The ultimate goal of the family is to create a miniature of a democratic society and implement democratic civic training. If we recognize that democracy is the path the world should take, we must start with the family. The following points are worth noting for parents:

(1) The moral standards in the family should be jointly observed by parents and children. There should never be double standards. Children should not smoke or drink, and adults should first quit. We hope that children will keep their promises, and we should first not break our promises. In other words, parents must always lead by example. As the saying goes, "If he is upright, he will be followed even without orders. If he is not upright, he will not be followed even with orders."

(2) The treatment of men and women in the family should be based on the spirit of equality. The bad habit of valuing men over women should be strictly avoided.

(3) Family work should be assigned to children from an early age according to their abilities. This approach can enable children to recognize the sacred meaning of work and train their ability to divide labor and cooperate. Both of these are closely related to children's future participation in a larger society.

(4) If the family employs servants, parents and children should treat them kindly and be grateful for their help. They should not be arbitrarily shouted at or scolded, and they should also try to help them improve and have a more fulfilling life. This can enable children to develop a proper attitude and proper relationship toward workers from an early age.

(5) When children's intelligence has developed to a certain extent, efforts should be made to involve them in family council meetings. Larger issues include the family budget and children's school enrollment. Smaller issues include bedtime and meal times and the furnishing of the living room. All of this can train children to develop reasonable opinions and increase their ability to cooperate. (Payment)

### Teachers

— Xiao Yu

"Teachers only give us instructions, but the achievements are still up to ourselves." Therefore, the target of students' criticism should not be teachers but themselves, and there is no need to be overly concerned about teachers' learning and character. To be able to understand anyone is the best learning!

A resume is only part of experience. People with higher status are not necessarily the most knowledgeable. Those who teach seriously are good teachers! The way to express learning is not just oral. The way to acquire learning is not just "listening"!

A teacher's views and knowledge may not be something that one can accept. Blindly following will lead to failure, but one's own thoughts can also incorporate the opinions of others. Common insights can be promoted and expanded through mutual discussion.

Teachers can help you acquire knowledge and discover your hidden talents, but they cannot inject knowledge into you or recreate you!

Teachers are others, you are yourself!

War

### Pre-War Advice

— By Breekenridge, Translated by Pinpin

—— Advice from an Army Chaplain

Soldiers and compatriots: Tonight may be the last time we meet. We march together, we share the dangers of combat, the troubles of retreat; we equally endure hardship and hunger, the sabotage of internal traitors, the oppression of external enemies. We sit by the same campfire every night, eat the same dry rations; we hear the reveille together and we work hard, hear the retreat and weary soldiers rest, with the earth as our bed and our knapsacks as our pillows.

Now, soldiers and brothers, we meet, in this peaceful valley, on the eve of battle, as the sunlight is fading from behind that mountain. That very sunlight will glitter tomorrow on a sea of blood.

Only for one day can our land lie in such peaceful sunlight! The green forest is so quiet, the ancestral cottages are emitting green smoke, and golden wheat fields dot the surrounding wilderness. The pleasant music of human voices awakens the silence of the forest. Now, merciful God, look at this change! By means of unreasonable pretexts, falsely invoking God's holy name, and asking for the Savior's help, that foreign race is slaughtering our people! They plunder our cities, they destroy our fields, and now they are surrounding our camp outside this quiet valley.

I know that you can be strengthened by God's blessing. Tomorrow, when you join the battle, you will be at peace and determined. In the hour of battle, the surroundings will be dim, and only the pervading cannon fire and fierce gunfire will flash. The dead will lie across your feet. Remember, soldiers, God is with you, the eternal God helps you fight; He drives on the clouds of war, He drives the warriors to fight in the storm. The terrible God, the invincible God, helps you fight, and you will be victorious.

"Those who live by the sword shall die by the sword."

You also wield swords, but your hearts are not for hegemony and tyranny. You wield swords for your homes, your laws, your children. You wield swords for truth, justice, and fairness; you will surely have joyous rewards. Your enemies wield swords to destroy what people love and to desecrate God; they will die by the sword.

Now, brothers and soldiers, I must bid you farewell. Many of us will die in battle tomorrow—may God grant peace to the souls of the dead!—Many of us may live to tell the story of tomorrow's battle, and the memory of this autumn night will linger in our minds. When we meet again, may the shadows of the evening sun shine on a free land.

May God bless their victory!

(September 10, 1777, during the American War of Independence)

### Great Friendship

— Liu Daohong

Great and sincere friendship can transform a negative person into a positive one and a pessimist into an optimist. A person becomes negative and pessimistic not by nature but because they feel the coldness of the environment: society gives them pain and despair, and the treatment from relatives and friends is indifferent and harsh. Therefore, they cannot discover a happy and noble life, nor can they pursue a fulfilling life interest. How can this not make them tend towards negativity and pessimism?

However, fervent and sincere friendship is a raging fire that will burn away the root of your pain. When you enjoy great friendship, you will discover that this society is not as filled with coldness, indifference, and pain as you previously imagined. There are also springs of happiness in it; there are also comrades who share your joys, sorrows, and anger. You are not alone; yes, at this time, you will feel that life may have some meaning. Therefore, no longer be negative and pessimistic, and together with the friend who moves you and gives you sincere friendship, move forward on the journey of life. Although there are obstacles, they cannot stop your progress.

No one does not hope to obtain sincere friendship, but the bad habits and conventions of modern society restrict the generation of passionate friendship everywhere. The generation of pure and sincere friendship requires at least achieving a degree of straightforwardness and selflessness. But in today's world, where the toxins of selfishness, jealousy, and suspicion are deeply rooted in people's hearts, how easy is it to achieve selflessness and straightforwardness?

Millionaire tycoons, powerful officials, and versatile geniuses may say: With my power, influence, wealth, and ability, I don't need any friends, let alone friendship. But what kind of stimulation will they suffer when their family property is gone, they lose their official position, and they suffer from all kinds of diseases! At that time, if there are no sincere friends to comfort, encourage, and help, there is no better path than negativity, pessimism, and ultimately falling into depravity and suicide!

We should first discover sincere and fervent friendship because sincere and great friendship is the beacon that discovers a fulfilling and noble life!

### Hoping for More "Beautiful" Movies

— Xin Liang

If we start our discussion with last year's top box-office hit—"One Millionth Teacher"—we must all acknowledge that its extraordinary success and global praise as the "best" film is largely due to the success of the original story. Secondly, it is the director's style and the actors' superb acting skills. Sometimes, even with a good and fulfilling script, if there is no good director and good actors to perform it vividly and dynamically, that good script may be ruined. Indeed, an allegedly "good" film requires an unknown amount of brainpower, diligence, and hard work during the production process.

In European and American countries, crudely made films certainly exist, but generally speaking, their serious and progressive production spirit is indeed worth emulating by our Chinese film industry colleagues.

Mr. Huaerzi said in his discussion of "One Millionth Teacher" that domestic historical costume dramas seem to have a downward trend. Indeed, after domestic films shifted from "contemporary dramas" to "historical costume dramas," there has been a decline. As for movies that can be called "good," I can boldly say: very few!

What I hope is that we should all make movies for the sake of "movies." We have plenty of good movie scripts; we don't have to look in the historical pile. As long as we are all willing to work hard and speak up for the noble mission of movies, everything can be done. As the saying goes, "Where sincerity is, metal and stone will open!" How are good movies produced? It's because we can do our best.

From now on, I hope there will be more genuinely "good" movies like "One Millionth Teacher" and "Orphan's Paradise," whose scenes are not grand, appearing in Shanghai. We are eagerly waiting!

### Trends in the Theatrical World of the Old Capital

— Wei Wei

Meng Xiaodong's Popularity Spreads Through Nine Cities

At the beginning of his move north, Li Shaochun once caused a sensation in the old capital with Tan-school Lao Sheng operas. Now that Shaochun has left Ping to go elsewhere, Meng Xiaodong, the Kunqu opera veteran specializing in Lao Sheng roles who has been in retirement for a long time, has reappeared and formed a troupe to perform in Ping. Xiaodong's operas have always enjoyed a good reputation. When discussing today's Tan-school Lao Sheng actors, people often compare Xiaodong with Fu Ying. Moreover, Xiaodong's entry into Shu Yan's school has gained Shu Yan's favor. Whenever Xiaodong performs, Shu Yan supervises and directs, which further shows Xiaodong's importance. Xiaodong in Ping rarely agreed to appear. In contrast, now she performs once a week at the Xin Xin Theater. In general, Tan-school Lao Sheng actors all regard Xiaodong's performance as a daunting challenge. Yan Jupeng and Ma Lianliang and others can attract audiences with new operas. Tan Fuying, with his Tan-family style, specializes in old operas, and his repertoire is the same as Xiaodong's, so he regards Xiaodong as his only strong enemy. It is said that when Xiaodong performed "Search and Rescue the Orphan" at the Xin Xin Theater, the audience was 1,000 people. On the same night, Fu Ying performed a double bill of "Sangyuan Society" and "Picking the Tassel" at the Chang'an Theater, with only a little over 400 seats occupied. The ticket prices for both were the same, but Fu Ying's appeal was not as good as Xiaodong's. One can imagine how popular Xiaodong is in Ping.

Wu Suqiu's First Love Matures

Wu Suqiu returned north with a great reputation and became very popular in Tianjin and other places with the opera "Spinning Cotton." As a result, her momentum has been increasing recently, and her popularity is no less than that of Xue Yanqin in her prime. The romance between Suqiu and Wang Helin, a top student at the opera school, has long been an open secret, and recently it has become more openly a secret. It is said that Wu Suqiu has obtained her mother's consent, and she will hold a wedding with Wang in the short term. It is said that Wu plans to form a married couple troupe after the wedding. Wang Helin is the only Lao Sheng talent at the opera school and has become a student of Ma Lianliang. His singing and acting are both excellent, and recently he has also studied martial arts operas. Given Suqiu's popularity in recent years, if she can cooperate with Helin, it will be even more wonderful, and the performance of husband and wife on the same stage will also become a legend.

Veteran Actors Change Careers One After Another

Zhou Ruisheng is the Wusheng actor who most resembles Yang Xiaolou. In terms of experience and qualifications, he is far above Sun Yukun, Gao Shenglin, and others, but unfortunately, time does not allow it, and his age is increasing. Now Zhou is in his sixties. Although he still performs from time to time, his past masterpieces such as "Golden Leopard" and "Picking the Battle Car" are rarely performed. Recent news has come that Zhou has decided to abandon his current work and switch to performing Guan operas (i.e., old man operas). With Zhou's tall stature and loud voice, his performance of Guan operas will surely be wonderful. Moreover, famous Dan actors such as Ruxiang, also a grandmaster in the opera world, have recently switched to singing Lao Dan roles due to their aging and fading beauty. Ruxiang used to sing Lao Sheng roles in her early years, and because she has both a big voice and a small voice, she will surely be able to handle singing Lao Dan roles with ease.

Child star Ai Muqin has interesting toys. She is only ten years old, and her bones are flexible, so she can make various poses, preparing to dedicate her skills on the stage and silver screen.

### A Newcomer on the Stage – Chen Qi

— Ye Hui

If the readers have seen the Chinese Travel Theater's performance of the Ibsen drama, and are not forgetful, they should remember that when the first act was just opened, a small song was sweetly transmitted from behind the stage to the ears of every concentrated and attentive audience member. Who was the singer of the song? It is Chen Qi, whom I am introducing now, who played Meiniang.

Her original surname is Chen, and her given name is Cuidi. She is nineteen years old, and her hometown is Ning County, Zhejiang. The year of the August 13 Incident was the year she graduated from the junior high school department of the Provincial Shangzhong School. In the fall of that year, the school resumed classes in the concession, and she was admitted to the senior high school business department for further study. Unexpectedly, she was suddenly expelled by the school last year because she joined the Sino-French Drama Society. The school believed that this would damage its reputation, so it had to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys and used strict expulsion measures. Therefore, she did not have the opportunity to study at the school again. Otherwise, this year would have been the time for her to complete her senior high school studies. Recently, she also made her debut in the film "Fragrant Concubine" produced by the United Film Company. I think that with her acting skills on the stage appearing on the silver screen, she probably won't disappoint.
