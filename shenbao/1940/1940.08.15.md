### British Foreign Secretary Assures Ambassador Guo of Close Attention to the Situation in Vietnam; Close Contact Maintained Between London and Washington; Vietnamese Governor-General Takes Necessary Measures to Deal with Serious Situation

London, news from here last night: Foreign Secretary Halifax provided assurances to Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to London, at the Foreign Office yesterday afternoon, stating that Britain is closely monitoring the importance of Vietnam to China and the interests of Britain and the United States there. London and Washington are maintaining close contact regarding Japan's intentions in Vietnam. Official denials from Tokyo regarding alleged Japanese requests to obtain naval and air force bases in Vietnam have evidently failed to be effective, and British and American authorities are redoubling their vigilance. According to well-informed sources, Japan's establishment of armed forces in Vietnam will be regarded as the first step in Japan's proclaimed southward advance policy. Although Japan's current goal is believed to be obtaining bases for attacking Yunnan and Guangxi, some believe that its second step might be to demand air force bases in Siam. Therefore, it is widely believed that Japan is gradually expanding towards Burma, Malaya, Borneo, and the Dutch East Indies, even India. Experts here say that the United States cannot sit idly by regarding Japan's southward advance into Vietnam, the possible blockade of China's export routes of tungsten, antimony, tung oil, tin, and hog bristles to the United States, or the "unjustified interference" hindering American exports to China via Vietnam. Regarding Japan's attitude, reported news is inconsistent. British newspapers report that the Vichy government initially intended to reject Japan's demands, but under German pressure, it is now preparing to concede to Japan's demands in Vietnam. However, this report also states that China has received notification from the Vichy government that Premier Pétain is prepared to crush Japan's ambitions and intentions if he receives guarantees of assistance from the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. As for the final fate and current intentions of the French warships in Vietnam in the event of a Japanese invasion, that remains a secret. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Vichy, news received here today states that a large number of Japanese troops have massed on the border of central Vietnam, and a Japanese fleet has also concentrated off the coast of Hainan Island. It is also reported that fierce battles have broken out between Chinese and Japanese troops in the border area, but this information has not been officially confirmed. Furthermore, news from Hanoi states that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux has taken necessary measures to deal with the serious situation. (United Press, 14th)

Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma recently stated that negotiations between Japan and the Vietnamese authorities, in addition to the ban on arms shipments to Chongqing, also touched upon other issues, but declined to specify what those issues were. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Chongqing, the English-language "Chu Pao" recently commented on the situation in Vietnam, stating, "The Japanese may have considered that if they want to achieve their goals, they must pay a very high price. Although it is generally rumored that the Japanese are advancing south, we believe that the Japanese are still hesitating because Germany has not expressed goodwill towards Japan, and the United States is preparing to take a firm stance if Japan infringes on the sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam. Furthermore, Britain has not completely abandoned the Far East and remains a strong power. As for the adjustment of Japanese-Soviet friendship, it is even more distant. All of these circumstances are unfavorable to Japan. The Japanese will surely think again before taking action." (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Hanoi, Vietnamese Governor-General General Decoux and his wife hosted a banquet at noon today for General Nishihara, head of the Japanese inspection team, Suzuki Rokuro, the Japanese Consul-General in Hanoi, and all members of the inspection team were also present. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

A small amount can make a robe, and a small amount of soil can make a hill. It is not difficult to do tens of thousands of yuan. The purpose is to promote the construction of a large air force through publicity, and to encourage us to work hard to build the country and the army. The thespian industry has never been behind others in patriotism, and will definitely be praised. (Dispatch, 14th)

### Pravda of the Soviet Union Comments on the Issue of Unified Command
### Proves the Strengthening of the Red Army and Navy
### Abolishing Political Commissars is to Enhance Military Authority

Moscow: Regarding the issue of unified command of the Red Army and Navy, Pravda commented: "This decision by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union proves the strengthening of the Red Army and Navy, and will further develop the Soviet military. In recent years, with the support of the Communist Party and the government, the cadres of the Soviet Red Army and Navy have been greatly strengthened. Soviet commanders, with the assistance of the Lenin-Stalin Party, have become outstanding military experts. As long as they live, they will fight for the motherland under the banner of Lenin and Stalin. They are very capable of commanding troops. Now that the principles of unified command and enhanced faith in commanders have been realized, the Red Army will become even stronger. The Red Army, from top to bottom, has iron-like discipline. The Red Army has now formed a strong rock, and any enemy invasion will be crushed." (TASS dispatch of the 13th)

Moscow: Stalin's decision to abolish political commissars in the military is seen as the most important development in the movement to increase the effectiveness of the military. Previously, political commissars in the military enjoyed the same authority as commanders. All orders issued by commanders had to be countersigned by them. However, commanders will now have full authority and bear political responsibility. Political commissars will now be renamed Deputy Commanders for Political Guidance. Pravda, Izvestia, and Red Star all stated that the system of political commissars in the military, created by Lenin and Stalin, is now outdated. It is now imperative to increase the authority of officers and enhance Soviet military power. In the current crisis-ridden international situation, increasing Soviet military power is absolutely necessary. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

According to Mr. Purvis's opinion, the first batch of 1,300 to 1,400 aircraft per month will largely begin in 1941. Aircraft engines are still the main problem in the British purchasing procedure.

### U.S. Congressmen Propose Two Suggestions for Assisting Britain

Washington: Yesterday, two suggestions for assisting Britain in resisting Germany were made in the U.S. Congress: one was to let Canada join the Pan-American Union, and the other was to sell some torpedo boats and 50 destroyers to Britain. Senator Thomas of Utah argued that Canada should participate in the joint defense of the republics of the Western Hemisphere, but this participation is not to conclude a mutual assistance or military agreement with the United States, but to join the Pan-American Union. There are also two Senators, one being Senator Lee Zhu Xu of Oklahoma, and the other being Senator Bubier of Florida. The latter advocated selling destroyers to Britain, and the former advocated selling torpedo boats to Britain. (Associated Press dispatch of the 14th)

### Chinese Products Exhibited in Germany Arouse Great Interest

Berlin: According to official announcements here, the Chinese exhibits at the Königsberg Fair have aroused great interest from all parties. For many years, Germany has purchased a large number of silk fabrics from China. In 1937 and 1938, Germany imported a total of 800,008 catties of Chinese silk fabrics, and also imported ramie from China, as all ramie in Germany is imported from China. In addition, Chinese goods shipped to Germany also include tungsten ore, copper, antimony, and other minerals. (Haitong Press dispatch)

### German Long-Range Guns Bombard the Southern Coast of England Across the Sea
### German Aircraft Groups Expand Their Scope of Air Raids
### More Than 1,000 Aircraft Engage in Combat on Both Sides

Berlin: German military personnel did not acknowledge the news in New York newspapers about the southern coast of England being bombarded by German long-range guns. (Haitong dispatch of the 14th)

A Town in Southeastern England: Explosion sounds that are obviously unrelated to the German air raids on England have aroused widespread belief that this town has been shelled by German forces across the English Channel. This belief has been strengthened after some shell fragments were found here. Reporters have also found a large piece, believed to be the end of a shell. The top floors of two civilian houses were bombed and collapsed, and splinters rained down on nearby roofs. The shock wave shattered windows within a half-mile radius. Nearby veterans said that this explosion must have been the result of an attack by German guns on the French coast 20 miles across the English Channel. They said there were no planes in the sky when they heard the explosion. (Associated Press dispatch of the 14th)

London: Last night at midnight, more than 1,100 British and German warplanes continued to clash in the skies over England. The British Air Ministry claimed that in this air battle, German aircraft were shot down at a rate of one per minute. According to unofficial estimates, more than 100 German aircraft have been shot down. German bombers bombed the coast between the Thames River and Portsmouth day and night. Wales, Scotland, and other parts of England were also bombed. More than 500 German aircraft attacked Southampton for more than two hours, and 29 were shot down. Hundreds of bombs were dropped, and there were several fires, but they were quickly extinguished. The Air Ministry admitted that 11 British aircraft were lost. It also claimed that the British Air Force's counterattacks on German-occupied areas in Europe were very successful. It is said that many German targets were severely damaged. (International News Service dispatch of the 14th)

Berlin: Yesterday morning, the German High Command issued a statement saying, "German bombers are now heading to England." This type of announcement is the first since the war. All previous air force actions have been kept secret. Germany's continuous air strikes on England have aroused widespread interest here. The concentration of air raids on various points on the southern coast of England without attacking the northern and eastern coast bases is also extremely important. The meaning of this is not known among German officials here. Authoritative circles also did not comment on the purpose of the current air force activities. "National Daily" stated, "Germany's day and night attacks will defeat the British Isles until the British war provocateurs are forced to surrender." The newspaper said that British anti-aircraft balloons are the best targets for German daytime air raids. Portsmouth was chosen as the primary target of this large-scale air raid because it is the patrol base for British attack submarines. (Associated Press dispatch of the 14th)

London: Yesterday afternoon, the German air blitz against England seemed to ease slightly at first, but soon became tense again. As many as 400 to 500 German aircraft soared over the skies of the British coast. According to a listening station on the southeast coast, it was reported that at 5:00 PM yesterday, it was heard on the listening device that German aircraft seemed to be flying over every two or three minutes. Another listening station said that it had heard hundreds of German aircraft immediately flying into the sky, and that air battles were taking place very high in the clouds, but it was difficult to see. Military and aviation experts ridiculed the so-called German air raids or sabotage of Dover's defenses in preparation for an attack on England. They believe that the terrain in Dover is steep, which is a great obstacle to the landing of German troops and heavy weapons. Naval officers pointed out that the purpose of the German air raids seems to be to sabotage the various facilities of Dover Port. However, if Hitler hopes to land there, this move would be greatly contrary to his purpose. (Associated Press dispatch of the 14th)

London: Hitler sent more than 1,000 bombers and fighters to attack the entire Strait and the southern coast of England. His purpose seems to be to use his three-to-one advantage in the number of aircraft to first destroy the British Air Force and then carry out an invasion. However, from another perspective, the recent German war plan seems to be another step in blockading the British Isles. As autumn approaches, Hitler must eliminate the British Air Force in the next four weeks. However, if what is stated in the British bulletin is true, then Hitler is now heading for failure. According to the figures announced by the British side, the ratio of British Air Force losses to German Air Force losses is three to one. If the British-German air war continues at this ratio, the number of aircraft on both sides will eventually be equal. However, Hitler's purpose is to fight one aircraft against another until the final stage, when the British Air Force will be completely eliminated, and the German side will still have a large number of aircraft, which can still hold air superiority. Neutral observers believe that the purpose of Germany's current air raids on England is to find out the enemy's weaknesses in order to strengthen its own strength, which is very similar to the initial stage of the invasion of France. The fact that 500 German aircraft bombed various British ports and their escort fleets cannot be immediately said to mean that the war has already begun. It must be waited until 5,000 German aircraft are dispatched to launch a fierce attack on various airfields and industrial centers in the British interior before it can be said that the real war to attack England has begun. (International News Service dispatch of the 13th)

### The Third Day of the German Group's Air Raids
### The British Air Force Achieves Unprecedented Battle Results

London: Yesterday was the third day of the German aircraft's continuous and intensive attacks on British shipping and cities. The British Air Force achieved unprecedented battle results, shooting down a total of 69 German aircraft. According to the Air Ministry's announcement, the British side also lost 11 fighters yesterday, but the pilots of 5 of them were safe. In the past three days, the German aircraft attacking England have lost 194 aircraft, of which 189 were shot down by the British Air Force and anti-aircraft fire, and 5 were naval aircraft. During the same period, the British side lost a total of 50 fighters. According to the Air Ministry's intelligence office, the speed at which German bombers and fighters were falling once reached one per minute. It is generally believed that a total of 500 German aircraft fought yesterday, flying in three batches directly towards Southampton and the coast of Kent, all of which were intercepted by Spitfire and Hurricane British fighter patrols and anti-aircraft fire. A gunner shot down 3 German aircraft yesterday, including 2 shot down in the afternoon. Thus, the British coastal anti-aircraft artillery team has shot down a total of 10 German aircraft in two days. In the Southampton area alone, the British fighter patrol team has destroyed 22 German aircraft. The team had shot down 7 German aircraft the day before, and severely damaged many German aircraft. Although the team has fought fiercely for two days, there have been no casualties of personnel or aircraft. In an air battle over Southampton yesterday, a German aircraft and a British fighter collided, and a high-explosive shell hit them, causing debris to fly and fall directly into the sea. There were also two other air battles yesterday, and many German aircraft were also shot down, but the details are unknown. At noon, 30 German aircraft, including Messerschmitt 110 German aircraft, Junkers 88 bombers, and Messerschmitt 109 fighters, were shot down 6 by a Hurricane British aircraft patrol team. At the same time, 5 German aircraft were shot down by a Hurricane British aircraft patrol team in the sea a few miles away. There was also an air battle at the mouth of the Thames River yesterday afternoon. A German aircraft was hit and crashed into the wilderness. All four crew members were not killed, but two were seriously injured and were captured by residents. The injured were sent to the hospital. In an air battle on the southwest coast yesterday afternoon, 4 German aircraft caught fire and crashed between the two towns, and many other German aircraft crashed into the sea. A lifeboat went back and forth six times to rescue the German crew members. The machine gun fire was fierce and terrifying during the battle, but the coastal artillery team did not fire, and no bombs fell. There was another air battle on the southeast coast last night. The German aircraft were driven into the sea before they could drop their bombs. According to a bulletin from the Air Ministry and the Department of Internal Security, German aircraft continued to attack England last night, and bombs were dropped in Southampton, causing several fires, which were quickly extinguished. There were few deaths and injuries. Rural areas in the Isle of Wight, Berkshire, and Wiltshire were also bombed, but no casualties were reported. Several British Air Force airfields in southeastern England were attacked, resulting in one death and several injuries. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

### The Berlin Communiqué Also Declares Victory: 132 British Aircraft Destroyed

Berlin: The army and air force fought fiercely with the British Air Force yesterday and achieved the greatest victory. No fewer than 96 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed in one day, of which 50 were shot down in air battles over the British Isles and the Strait, 30 were destroyed at British airfields, and 16 were shot down while attacking Danish cities. The German aircraft lost 24 aircraft, and 5 air force personnel were killed. (Haitong dispatch of the 14th)

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that yesterday, German aircraft bombed port facilities in Walsall, Hartlepool, Bournemouth, and Portsmouth, as well as arsenals in Exeter and Bristol and oil depots in Buckingham. Two patrol boats and two merchant ships (15,000 tons) were sunk in the English Channel and at the mouth of the Thames River. German fighters dropped bombs on airfields in Ystrad, Detling, Farnborough, Andover, Wardyham, and other places, and many oil depots and factories were destroyed. Fierce air battles occurred many times during the German attack on the English Channel and England, and as many as 74 British aircraft were destroyed. Yesterday, when British aircraft attempted to attack Aalborg, Denmark, German destroyers and anti-aircraft guns were unusually active. Before several aircraft approached their target, they were repelled and 16 enemy aircraft were shot down, and only 7 escaped. In total, 132 enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, of which 89 were shot down in air battles, and 43 were destroyed by anti-aircraft guns and bombed on the ground. 12 barrage balloons were shot down. 28 German aircraft are missing. A submarine commanded by Captain Van Hermen sank 41,611 tons of enemy cargo, including a British auxiliary ship (11,400 tons).

### The Free French Navy Participates in Combat for the First Time
### British Aircraft Groups Attack German-Occupied Areas at Night

London: General de Gaulle's London Headquarters recently issued an official bulletin stating that when a port in southern England was recently attacked by 100 German bombers, the crew members of the Free French warships under General de Gaulle's command used French "75" caliber guns to join in the fierce bombing amidst fierce anti-aircraft fire, shooting down 2 German aircraft. This is the first time that the Free French Navy has participated in combat. Its previous war trophies, such as 2 German aircraft machine guns and 2 German Iron Crosses, have now been transported to the flagship of the Free French Navy. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

London: The Air Ministry issued a bulletin last night stating that British Air Force bombers attacked the Cossack aircraft factory, munitions factory, and other targets in northwestern Germany and German-occupied areas in France and the Netherlands last night. Bombing was carried out through heavy clouds and strict blockades, hitting the target, and causing fires and explosions in many places. 17 airfields and the Bergen seaplane base were also attacked. 4 British aircraft did not return. British Air Force bombers also cooperated with naval aviation to bomb the port of Hildou on the Dutch coast. Yesterday, the area of activity for British medium bombers during the day ranged from Jutland in Denmark to the Bay of Biscay in France, attacking the enemy-occupied Walcheren and Cherbourg airfields and the Brest seaplane base. 12 British aircraft did not return. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

### British Escort Fleets Continuously Attacked
### British and German Torpedo Boats Make Contact

London: The Admiralty issued a bulletin last night stating that early yesterday morning, British motor torpedo boats made contact with a small team of enemy ships. First, when the British torpedo boats were sailing at a speed of about 30 nautical miles, they saw two enemy small ships only 100 yards away. One torpedo boat thought the other party was an enemy torpedo boat. Because they were too close, they could not take other actions, so they had to ram forward. However, the enemy ship was larger than the torpedo boat, causing a British torpedo boat's head to be slightly damaged. Another British torpedo boat drove between the two enemy ships and engaged in combat with machine gun fire and hand grenades, with great success. The enemy ship counterattacked, scattered and weak. A third British torpedo boat drove past the two enemy ships and saw two larger enemy ships, so it fired machine guns at them. Then, a British torpedo boat and an enemy torpedo boat engaged in pursuit twice. The sky was dark during the battle, and it was impossible to determine what damage the enemy ship had suffered. After the battle, several British torpedo boats were attacked by a German aircraft from an altitude of 500 feet. The British boats retaliated fiercely, and the gunfire was accurate. The German aircraft was seen to be hit, catch fire, and crash. There were no deaths or injuries on the British side. Except for one boat that was slightly damaged by the collision, the remaining boats were undamaged. The boat that collided has also safely returned. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

Berlin: German military experts made the following supplementary battle reports to a Haitong Press interviewer yesterday: German aircraft continued to bomb the southeastern and southern coasts of England, and German aircraft laid mines outside British ports and attacked escort fleets. The main purpose of the German air strike on the 12th was the British naval base of Portsmouth. Naval docks, arsenals, oil depots, and other naval buildings in the port were hit and caught fire. The power plant and shipyard were still burning yesterday. German aircraft lost 12 aircraft, but shot down four times as many enemy aircraft as we did. Dive bombers hit several armed merchant ships at the mouth of the Thames River and sank many ships, the tonnage of which is unknown. Bombers attacked the escort fleet to the east of Fudan and sank a total of 8,000 tons of cargo. British aircraft invaded northern and western Germany on the 12th night, and 4 were shot down by our anti-aircraft guns. On the naval front, German torpedo boats attacked British speedboats and destroyed many. The British speedboats broke through and escaped. Because there was fog at sea at the time, the British boats were able to escape safely. (Haitong dispatch of the 14th)

### Anglo-Italian Agreement Expires
### Britain No Longer Bound

London: Lord Davies asked in the House of Lords yesterday whether the government would recognize Selassie as the legitimate ruler of Abyssinia, and whether it would provide him with various assistance within its power to overthrow the invasion and restore his throne. Lord Horder, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, replied that the government wanted it to be known that, in view of Italy's declaration of war against Britain and its intention to invade, Britain felt that it should retain complete freedom of action with respect to any restrictions previously established with Italy relating to territories in North Africa, East Africa, and the Mediterranean. This statement includes the 1938 Anglo-Italian Agreement, which legally recognized Italy's conquest of Abyssinia. Therefore, the British government has paid attention to the points raised by Davies, so please Davies not to ask any further questions for the sake of public interest. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

### Relations Between Italy and Greece Become Increasingly Tense
### Protest to be Lodged Against the Killing of Hoggia
### Athens Denies Rumors of a Military Corps Mutiny

Rome: Relations between Italy and Greece became more tense yesterday as officials announced that Italy considers the killing of Hoggia, an Albanian patriot, to be a very regrettable event. However, the rumors that Italy has sent an ultimatum to Greece were solemnly denied. They said that the government is currently studying the report sent by the Italian Albanian authorities in Greece. An authoritative source said that Italy may lodge a protest with Athens in the near future, but it will never take the form of an ultimatum. Also, Caeta wrote in the Italian newspaper that "in addition to plotting to murder Albanian patriots, Greece also intends to prevent Albania's independence. This move is the responsibility of the government and the army, so that the power of propaganda can be used to incorporate southern Albania into the Greek territory." Other Italian newspapers also made similar comments. The "Popolo" newspaper declared that the assassination of another Albanian fascist, Chiangu Vesi, in Chaila on Saturday, has made him the first of the "Dalmatian" fascists to sacrifice. Italy has been working for the past decade to separate "Dalmatia" from Yugoslavia. The fascist newspaper also solemnly pointed out Italy's plan to reorganize the Balkans. (Associated Press dispatch of the 14th)

Rome: Italy has recently refuted the explanatory announcement issued by Athens regarding the assassination of Hoggia (whom the Italians call an Albanian patriot, and the Greeks call a bandit), and is stepping up its efforts to provoke emotions in Albania and Greece. For example, Mussolini's mouthpiece Caeta wrote an article published in the Italian People's Daily, saying that Italy has many evidences that prove that Greece is politically persecuting Albanian patriots under its rule, and Hoggia was assassinated by Greeks instigated by the Greek authorities. According to Rome Radio, the Italian government has obtained solid evidence that Greece is responsible for Hoggia's murder, and this conspiracy was carried out in Greece. The Italian Foreign Minister recently gave a speech, stating that Italy regards the Albanian border as sacred and inviolable and will defend it. The Greek government apparently does not understand or does not want to understand the meaning of this statement. The Greek government is now challenging the Axis powers in the spirit of destroying national freedom. At this time when the history of Europe is being decided, this kind of deliberate mistake is intolerable. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

London: Regarding the assassination of Hoggia near the border between Greece and Albania, Rome Radio broadcasted last night, blaming the case on Britain. It is said that Britain is now trying to set fire to the powder keg of Europe in the Balkans. The assassination of Hoggia is intended to push the Greek Metaxas government, which is superficially neutral, toward a dead end. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

Madrid: The Spanish ABC newspaper's Berlin dispatch hinted that there is still turmoil in Albania. It is said that "Berlin does not pay attention to the events that occurred in Albania." (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

Athens: Greek newspapers only published reports on the Albanian incident yesterday, but strongly denied rumors of a Greek military corps mutiny. (Haitong dispatch)

### The Biggest Trial in French History Begins
### Civil and Military Officials Guilty of Malfeasance Will Be Investigated

Vichy: By order of the Pétain government, the largest political trial in French history began yesterday afternoon in the Criminal Court of the Lyon Supreme Court, presided over by Prosecutor Caseno. Judges and lawyers all wore special costumes. Caseno read out the indictment, mentioning the government's new decrees and various articles of the French Criminal Code.

It was decided that those who endanger the security of the country internally and externally will also be prosecuted. Regardless of their position, all criminals will be investigated. Thus, the prosecution of ministers, journalists, bankers, and others who caused the collapse of France began. The first interrogation will begin this morning. It is heard that there are many French financiers involved, but the investigation of banker Dreifus will not be held. (Haitong dispatch)

### Pétain Urges French Youth to Strive to Promote the National Spirit
### National Habits of Complacency Lead to Disaster
### The Government Will Pay Attention to Four Matters in Future Measures

Vichy: Marshal Pétain delivered a radio address at 7:30 PM today, detailing the various issues that the government is concerned about, and strongly stated that most of the problems can be solved, and other difficult problems are being carefully studied. The reason why the government has not been able to return to Paris immediately is that the German authorities insisted that it must wait until certain material conditions are met before it can return, and it is not that the government is deliberately delaying it. In the last paragraph, he called on the people of the country to act in good conscience and fulfill their responsibilities. The entire speech lasted only 15 minutes. The main points are translated as follows:

General Pétain first said, "Some people point out that the government does not care about the needs of the people. This kind of slander can be easily refuted with facts. In terms of the various measures that the government has taken, the clarification of administrative agencies is one, the elimination of the harm of alcoholism is two, subsidizing families is three, and reforming education is four. Furthermore, in terms of the problems that urgently need to

Old Newspaper Excerpts Sixty-Seven Years Ago (476) Seen in a Rare Record from the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty In Ningnan, at the Yinjiang Bridge, local villagers, due to a prolonged drought, collectively went to the Tiandayanyan Dragon Pool to present a petition and silently pray. They also hired a Taoist priest to perform rituals and write talismans. These talismans were usually not burned but placed on the water surface to sink. However, after a full day and night, the talismans did not sink. Instead, a piece of paper emerged from the bottom, with clear writing that boldly stated, "Must wait for my old friend Ren Mou to arrive before we can welcome rain." Everyone was astonished and disappointed! After searching everywhere, they found no such person. Suddenly, they discovered the name in the Wang family genealogy. However, the person had been dead for over a hundred years. Thus, the villagers wrote this name in the petition and went to pray again. Immediately, the talismans sank, and the dragon indeed appeared. The following night, there was heavy rain. It was also heard that in a neighboring area bordering Fenghua, at the Chai Kai Ling Pass, people also sought rain at a dragon pool due to drought. Suddenly, a snake was seen floating on the water, larger than normal, baring its fangs and claws, causing widespread fear! After repeated prayers, it suddenly transformed into a small snake, but people still feared it,不敢掬,將磁鉢擎在水面, and dared not scoop it up. Instead, they held a porcelain bowl on the water surface, asking it to enter on its own. The snake indeed wriggled inside. It was carried to the ancestral hall for worship, where it immediately transformed back into its original form, causing great fear! That night, it appeared in a dream to the clan elder, saying: "I am only capable of small rains and can only cure diseases. Those with internal ailments should take the ashes of incense, and those with external injuries should apply the water from the bowl. It will be effective." Testing it proved true. In reality, dragons are ancient animals and are now extinct. Moreover, rain is not caused by dragons. This is recorded here merely as an anecdote for idle talk after tea or wine.

Free Talk Our Path Min Zhen Remembering a friend saying, "How do you live? Lately, I only feel depressed and bored. I spend my days in ordinariness, living a dull life. Every day, every night, I'm in monotony and frustration, vaguely wasting the ruthless years... Friend, I don't need to say it, you can imagine the desolation of a lost, wandering goose, flying alone in the sky, its long cries only echoing off the walls, resounding in the empty valley..." What is this for? Before, I also experienced his sadness, melancholy, and vagueness. It was as if I were living on a haunted, desolate island, surrounded by a black sea, a black sky, and a black earth, enduring pain among thorns and poisonous stingers, trembling with faint hope, often gazing at the distant, distant horizon, trying to find some glimmer of enlightenment - only my current situation is different from his. - I am groping in the dark for the door of life. But he? He has abandoned the key to opening the door of life, deserted the ranks, repeatedly and longingly knocking on the door, lingering by the side of the door. People who have lost their faith are ultimately in pain, and aren't those whose faith is wavering also in pain? Perhaps - I imagine it this way - like a sailing ship sailing in the vast sea, hesitating or unable to hold the rudder of reality, losing its way in the endless night, in the storm and waves. Perhaps they are afraid of facing the surging waves, losing the courage to fight, the confidence in victory, and finally wavering and doubting the long and arduous journey, stagnating, with feelings of melancholy and longing, watching their companions struggling for survival and freedom, and sinking deeper into irresolvable contradictions. You say, isn't it so? Based on my speculation, I'm afraid no one, in the bleak autumn days, doesn't yearn for the bright spring days of the past! I'm afraid no one will rejoice in losing the warmth and tenderness! It's truly like a baby leaving its mother's embrace, feeling lonely and wanting to cry. Pity, those who doubt their faith and are troubled! I will mourn for you. However, there is no need to turn longing and yearning into a fantasy, nor is there a need to regretfully lament the passing clouds. "Youth is either death, or living to be the master of the world." These are the words of a great writer. This is our light, our path. Our path may be long and dark, with obstacles and difficulties ahead, but our faith will encourage us to complete this path. We cannot say when we will complete this long journey. But at least we believe this: our predecessors have left us valuable traces of exploration, and we have seen the dawn in the darkness, so why should we doubt our path? Shoe Shining Luo Daoai When Lincoln was President of the United States, a foreign diplomat once walked into a room and saw Lincoln shining his own shoes. He arrogantly exclaimed, "Mr. President! Are you shining your own shoes?" "Yes," Lincoln replied. "Whose shoes do you shine?" Happiness Lin I exhaled a breath, and finally, the moon rose again. On the horizon, there were no clouds, only the afterglow of the sunset in the west remained. The summer night wind blew across the desolate wilderness, ruffling my thin clothes on the quiet creek bank. I felt relieved, I felt infinitely relaxed! So, I laughed freely like a small bird breaking out of its cage! The dullness of the past few years prevented me from getting any freedom. I spent my days in tears, longing for the wilderness of my motherland like a prisoner. Facing the morning sun, I showed a joyful smile. I knew this was a symbol of light, and I yearned for such light even more! Listening carefully to the pine wind in the quiet night, I recalled the killings on the battlefield. How heroic were the soldiers who galloped freely on the battlefield! I admired them, I loved them even more; I also wished to hold a broadsword and ride a warhorse across the wilderness, but around me were the guards of demons. Could they allow you to take a breath? Having tasted all the hardships and experienced all the difficulties, finally, I struggled out! The long journey made me feel a little tired, but I felt happy, I felt I was a free man! People with freedom are happy. I am a happy person! Views on the Life of a Professional Bank Employee Anonymous The work of a bank employee, from the outside, seems so easy, idle, and the enjoyment is so comfortable and noble. Many people think this is truly a veritable golden rice bowl. In fact, the life of a bank employee is quite the opposite; the stereotyped and tedious daily work is already very boring. In addition, the hierarchical concept between colleagues is deeply rooted, and those of equal status have a psychological barrier of mutual contempt. As a result, daily interactions and laughter between colleagues are only a hypocritical formality. So-called sincere friendship is very difficult to produce. If there is even a slight conflict of interest between them, it is even easier to arouse jealousy. In this boring work life, one cannot get spiritual pleasure. Even if there is, it is only a little material comfort. However, the pleasure derived from material things is truly fleeting, and much of it will damage spiritual development. Many bank employees, after serving for several years, mostly get used to a pampered environment, making themselves unconsciously overindulge. Even to drink a glass of water or sharpen a pencil, they must dispatch a servant to do it for them. In dealing with people, they also appear arrogant and delicate everywhere, with no heroic spirit at all. Moreover, many are immersed in extravagant dreams. Zeng Guofan said: "Once accustomed to extravagance, if you want to return to frugality, it is like ascending to heaven." Therefore, these people gradually do not hesitate to push themselves into the ranks of the living dead, letting the evil customs of society manipulate them. They do not hesitate to betray the energy of their lives, unable to create anything of value. Even if people admire their idle and comfortable lives, in fact, they are only slaves to life. What joy is there in being a slave to life? However, the banking profession itself, although not worthy of the admiration of outsiders, is not truly as meaningless as those inside feel. The problem still lies in whether one can control that easily shifting life, because in history, many great men, no matter what predicament or threatening position they were in, had a steadfast spirit of neither being discouraged nor arrogant, and never being moved by the environment. Therefore, their personalities can also shine through the ages. I think that whether they are bank employees or not, they should recognize the value of their individual lives, and should know what kind of life is worthy of admiration and what kind of life is detestable. This is the proper attitude towards life. Poverty is Not a Crime Ren An Pawnshops are of course set up for the penniless, and detention centers are not necessarily prepared for the poor, are they? The more people who go to pawnshops, the more people go to detention centers, and vice versa, the more people who go to detention centers, the more people go to pawnshops. Pawnshops and detention centers are indeed accidental, but poverty and crime are not accidental, are they? This is my childish association, but it is not necessarily not the truth. I remember that the old Russian writer Ostrovsky wrote a three-act comedy called "Poverty is No Vice". In this play, a rich merchant's daughter falls in love with her father's poor clerk. At first, her father strongly opposes this matter, but later, because her uncle defends her, saying that although the clerk is poor, poverty is not a crime after all, she finally wins her father's permission and marries her lover of unequal status. "Poverty is No Vice", what a title that makes fun of the poor! This is why comedy is comedy. The Return of the Dancing Queen: A Case by Hawthorne Cheng Xiaoqing Chapter Five: Bad News I felt a dilemma. Before I could meet Hawthorne again, I had to keep Yu Gantang in my sight. But as soon as I walked to the west entrance of the tunnel, I was in a dilemma. I saw Yu Gantang standing at the elevator door, his left hand pressing the doorbell button. Could I walk up to him and take the elevator down together? Wouldn't that arouse his suspicion? Because when I was going upstairs, I was clearly standing in front of him, and he couldn't possibly have no impression. What would be the consequences if he suspected me? But the situation did not allow me not to go down with him. The steel door of the elevator opened, and Yu Gantang stepped in. I also quickened my pace. The driver saw me and stopped to wait for me. I still pretended to be calm and walked in with my eyes lowered. Besides Yu Gantang and me, there was only one woman in the elevator. At this moment, a tense and funny situation arose. As soon as I entered the elevator, my gaze never made contact with Yu Gantang, I only looked at the woman. Her age was at least over thirty, but the colors of her clothes were dazzling like those of a seventeen or eighteen-year-old. I saw the woman's eyes glancing at Yu Gantang; Yu Gantang was clearly looking at me. The eyes of the three people formed a funny cycle. I instinctively felt that his gaze had never moved. I was secretly a little surprised. I only hated that I didn't carry a gun with me. The elevator descended to the third floor, and I finally got relief. After the steel door opened, two male guests came in. I moved aside a little, and used these two people as my defense against Yu Gantang. But his gaze penetrated my defenses and was still looking at me carefully. Strange! Did he really suspect me? If I didn't look back at him again, the situation might get worse. I turned my eyes and casually made eye contact with him. Alas, his eyes were terrible, he was staring at me without blinking! When the elevator reached the lowest floor, I deliberately lagged behind, but Yu Gantang also stood aside, letting the woman go out first. I didn't know if he was following the Europeanized rule of "ladies first", or if he wanted to observe my actions. But he finally went out as the third person. I was the last one, walked out of the elevator, and stopped to take out a cigarette and light it. While I was smoking, I took the opportunity to look around, and Hawthorne was no longer in the phone booth. (76)

Entertainment World: Canada, the New Film Capital Hua Zhi Canada is a British territory in North America, and its film industry has never been very developed. However, since the outbreak of the European War, the threat of air raids on the British mainland has been very serious. All valuable cultural artifacts and various important industries have been transferred to the Americas. The film industry has been regarded as a powerful tool for war propaganda and maintaining the empire's industry, so of course it has been carefully arranged. Among them, companies such as Alexander Korda Corporation and London Film Productions have moved their money-making machines to Hollywood, while other companies have moved to Canada to produce anti-war films. At the same time, film companies from other European countries have also moved to Canada, so the local film industry has been developing rapidly. The films screened in Canada come from various countries, with the most being British and American films, followed by French, Italian, and Chinese productions. Among them, Chinese productions once occupied the fourth place. However, since the authorities implemented strict inspections of foreign films, anti-war films from the free areas of China have been slightly affected. Until recently, with the conflict between Britain and Italy and the worsening relations between Britain and France, French and Italian films have been sluggish, and Chinese films have a good chance of rising to third place. Achievements of the Shanghai Drama School Mei Hua Guan Zhu The Shanghai Drama School, run by Mr. Xu Xiaochu, is a prototype of the old-style opera troupe. Although the organization and equipment are not as complete as the China Opera School and Fu Lian Cheng Ke She in Beijing, the school authorities' spirit is very full. Compared with the two classes in Beijing, this one is not necessarily inferior to that one. Therefore, since its establishment last winter, for half a year, the students' performance has exceeded our expectations. For example, Guan Zhengming and Xia Zhengfeng in the Sheng role, Zhou Zhengwen and Lu Zhengmei in the Dan role, and Xu Zhengjun and Zhou Zhengli in the Jing role are not only talented, but their speed of progress is truly astonishing to those who are old in this field. This point alone is enough to prove the seriousness of the school's executives and the effectiveness of its teaching. According to Principal Chen of the school, in the early days of the school's establishment, there were some difficulties in the administrative aspect, but he did not reduce his interest due to the difficulties. Now, the scale is roughly complete, and various affairs have gradually been on track. Thanks to the loyal service and enthusiastic teaching of the faculty and staff, even in a very short process, the entire student body has a considerable understanding of the various plays taught. For example, plays such as "Visiting the Mother" and "Entering the Palace" have been rehearsed several times and are able to perform in an orderly manner. This is somewhat gratifying and comforting to those who care about opera studies. However, this matter is important and cannot be accomplished by a small number of people. It depends entirely on the enthusiastic support and guidance of drama experts and drama-loving comrades so that this concrete and small-scale class can have a day to be developed and expanded. This is not only the pursuit of one person, but also the willingness of all sectors of society to help. I believe that drama has always been despised by the literati, but in recent years, it has shown a gradual trend of development. With the active promotion of the government (the National Government established a National Drama School early on), the public's view of money has also changed accordingly. What was once despised is now transformed into something that is valued. Shanghai is the place where drama is most popular, and the establishment of a class is an urgent need. Now, Mr. Xu Chennuo is taking the promotion and support as his own responsibility. One call rises high, and followers gather like clouds. The future of drama has suddenly opened up a bright path. In a few years, there will be a more developed day. Therefore, how can we neglect the establishment of the Shanghai Drama School? Random Talk on Chi Shigong Leng Bai Every Jingchao actor who comes south must have a senior artist accompanying him. Regarding this, it seems to have become a popular trend in the current Peking opera scene. For example, when Wang Yurong came last year, we remember that there was another old actor, Wang Yaoqing, serving as the supervisor. This year, Ma Suliang performed in Golden, and Guo Chunshan, a senior, also came to direct the proceedings. This time Tan Fuying came, and Xiao Pei also came with him. At the same time, Li Shengzao will also perform in Huang Yu, and the old Sheng, formerly known as Gao Qingkui, will also supervise and direct, following Wang Yaoqing's example. As for Chi Shigong, the central figure of this article, he is a newer upcoming pillar of Sheng. Due to his first time coming south, his grandfather, Chi Zijun, will also come with him. His grandfather is already over seventy years old and worked with Tan Xinpei in the same troupe. Now, out of love for his grandson, he does not hesitate to travel a long distance. It can truly be said that he is old but vigorous. Regarding Chi Shigong's performance skills, he is now unanimously recognized in Beijing as a handsome young Sheng. He is a graduate of Fu Lian Cheng (Shi Class) and is only twenty-three years old, but he is able to perform many plays. He specializes in singing plays such as "Empty City Stratagem", "Hongyang Cave", "Visiting the Mother", and "Arresting and Releasing". His acting is also elegant and unrestrained. His father, Chi Jingkun, is a Wusheng actor, but he is not planning to come this time. Finally, one more thing to mention is that his grandfather is also a typical figure in the Chou role. When there is an opportunity, he may accompany his grandson on stage to show his face. "Guanshiyin" Screening Huayi's first Chinese Buddhist epic film "Guanshiyin" will be screened at the Heguang Theater in Shanghai starting at 9:15 tonight. Huayi spent eight months and 200,000 yuan in capital to film "Guanshiyin", mobilizing all of Huayi's stars and more than 10,000 extras. Therefore, "Guanshiyin" has undoubtedly become a giant structure representing Chinese films. The Chinese Buddhist Association and famous Buddhist figures have contributed many opinions for the production of the film "Guanshiyin" and have also lent many rare and precious classics for "Guanshiyin". Therefore, the plot is completely based on the essence of these many classics. "Guanshiyin" does not promote superstition. It points out the true meaning of life and also explains the compassion of "killing one person to save a hundred people". "Guanshiyin" does not teach people to cultivate immortality and become Buddhas, but teaches people to sacrifice the small self to benefit all beings. This is the true purpose. Circus Opened Last Night The Olympic Circus is one of the world's largest circuses. A few days ago, it invited reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers to visit the interior and the zoo. It was seen that the collection of fierce beasts such as lions, elephants, tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, apes, and crocodiles was very rich. According to the owner, Yi Shiguyu, the troupe has been established for thirty-seven years and currently has more than one hundred performers. It has performed all over the world and has been well received by all sectors of society. This performance in Shanghai will surely refresh the eyes and ears of the people of Shanghai. Brief News The fourth issue of the "Zhao Zhong" Weekly has been published yesterday. Because of its correct attitude and sensitive news, the magazine is highly valued by the film industry. It is sold for one corner at all newspaper stands, and there are various discounts for subscribers.

### The Anglo-Italian War in North Africa and the Near East

Of the two battlefields in the current European war, the North Sea coast is naturally where the main forces of Britain and Germany clash and where the final decisive battle will take place. However, the situation in the Mediterranean and Red Sea is more subtle and the relationship more complex. If the Axis powers do not immediately launch a blitzkrieg to invade the British Isles, but instead prepare to exhaust Britain's strength and resources and disrupt its overseas connections in various ways, then North Africa and the Near East will certainly be given more importance by Germany and Italy. In fact, apart from the main forces of both sides engaging in battle, only the competition in that area can best demonstrate the rise and fall of each other's strength and their future fortunes.

German General Ludendorff said: "North Africa will be the main battlefield of the Second World War." Although that prediction has increased the importance of the North European battlefield due to the success of Germany's blitzkrieg strategy and the rapid defeat of France, and has placed Tunisia and Algeria outside the battlefield, the struggle for North Africa still has important decisive significance. If the Axis powers' goal is to promote the disintegration of the British Empire, then Italy bears the main responsibility for achieving this goal in North Africa and the Near East. The recent fierce fighting on the Libyan border, the struggle for Somaliland, and the turmoil between Albania and Greece are all local manifestations of this attempt. Of course, Mussolini's ambitions are by no means limited to cooperating with Germany's strategic needs. His long-cherished wish to turn the Mediterranean into "our sea" and his ambition to inherit Britain's leadership position among Islamic nations are all preparing to be realized in one fell swoop. On this point, there must already be a tacit understanding between Germany and Italy.

Judging solely from the situation in the Mediterranean, Britain still possesses a strong navy, but its strategic position is not very advantageous. Therefore, for the past two months, Britain has only been able to adopt a defensive posture in that area and has not actively exerted an offensive effect. After France surrendered, the British navy in the western Mediterranean already felt difficulties. If Spain were to join the Axis powers' battle line, it would certainly put even more pressure on the British side. Now Italy has launched an offensive against Greece, and it is rumored that pro-German and pro-Italian military personnel in Greece are advocating against the Greek authorities' pro-British policy, which may not be difficult to force Greece to submit. Therefore, although Italy may not easily eliminate the British naval forces in the Mediterranean, and may not even be able to break through Britain's blockade of the eastern and western straits, the Mediterranean, especially the four seas, may temporarily become an Italian inland sea.

Even if Italy's attempt to monopolize the Mediterranean were successful, it would not have a decisive effect on Italy's own future or the future of the European war. What is more important is the advance and retreat of both sides in North Africa and the Near East: for several years, Italy's various activities and uses of the Islamic people have been prepared to cooperate with this military action. Especially since the conquest of Abyssinia, how to integrate its North African and East African territories and get rid of Britain's control and constraints in the Red Sea has been the problem that Mussolini has most painstakingly sought to solve. They have provoked the dispute in Palestine, befriended Yemen among the Arab states, and in their North African and East African territories, they have strived to increase respect and treatment for Muslims, so as to create a potentially powerful pan-Islamic movement, preparing to seize Britain's rule over Muslims. At present, with the East African war raging, there is no doubt that this brewing will become even more tense. However, the modern Islamic movement is a very broad liberation movement. Although their culture is relatively backward, their understanding is not vague. Their true goal is to unite the Islamic masses of North Africa and the Near East, get rid of colonial shackles and achieve true freedom and independence. Like all other national movements, it is by no means a tool that aggressors can use to realize their ambitions. In the previous European war, Turkey joined the Allied side because of its pro-German stance, which caused widespread dissatisfaction among Muslims in Central Asia and North Africa, and ultimately led to the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Today's Muslims may not be willing to repeat this mistake. In recent years, the Fascists have put a lot of effort into the Islamic movement, but the effect has not been significant. When Abyssinia and Albania were devastated, the attitude of international Muslims was very clear. In this European war, no matter who wins or loses, they will take the opportunity to seek liberation. Therefore, those who call themselves "protectors of Islam" and those who harbor any aggressive intentions, if they want to gain something from them, I am afraid they will eventually be disappointed!

The struggles currently taking place in the Mediterranean and Red Sea are only preliminary battles in nature, and their impact, whether winning or losing, is not yet significant. How the situation in that area will develop in the future depends on how both sides engage in offense and defense, and how much strength those who take the offensive will use as a desperate bet.

### Japanese Prime Minister Konoe Abandons One-Party Policy, Recognizes All Parties as Legal Organizations, New Political Structure Will Still Be Established

Tokyo, "Asahi Shimbun" reported yesterday that although Prime Minister Konoe still wants to establish a new political structure, he has abandoned the one-party policy. The government will explain its views to all political parties and recognize all parties as legal organizations. That is, other political organizations outside the new political structure will also be recognized. It is also learned that the new political structure can be established soon, and there is no need to amend the constitution, only to make slight changes within the scope of the current constitution. "Hochi Shimbun" reported that Prime Minister Konoe intends to amend the election law so that candidates for members of the House of Representatives must be nominated by "legal organizations recognized by the government" before they can participate in the election. The election expenses can be borne by the state, and the annual salary of members will be increased from 3,000 yen to 6,000 yen. (Havas telegram on the 13th)

Tokyo, Yomiuri Shimbun recently reported that the position of Colonial Minister was originally held concurrently by Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke. Recently, Matsuoka told Prime Minister Konoe that the affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are complicated, and it is difficult to take care of the position of Colonial Minister concurrently. The Prime Minister then decided to appoint someone else to specialize in the position. At this time, the highest voice is for Lieutenant General Tatekawa, a national responsibility expert. However, it is heard that Matsuoka advocates for Akita, who was the Minister of Health and Welfare in the Abe Cabinet, to succeed him. (Havas telegram on the 13th)

### Soviet Newspaper Commentary on Japan's New Political System

Moscow, today's Pravda has an article on the movement for a new political system in Japan, which roughly says that since the Konoe cabinet came to power, it will be a month, but the emergence of a new political system is still far away. Konoe is carrying out this matter with an extremely cautious attitude, but the failure to realize the new political system immediately is not because the advocates lack determination, but because the actual situation does not allow it, and is caused by the disputes between the opposing factions of the Japanese ruling class. In terms of the actual situation, the opposing factions in Japan are unwilling to listen to each other's instructions. The disputes between the military and the old political parties, and the opposition between the financial circles and the oligarchic rulers have not stopped. However, the military has recently slightly weakened the power of its opponents. Konoe himself now attaches great importance to the opinions of the so-called "Nikki-ha," and the so-called "Bunryoku-ha" is nothing more than the current task of the military, that is, to create a situation that is conducive to formulating the basic principles for realizing the new political system. Such an attempt will inevitably lead to sharp conflicts between the ruling classes. (Telegram on the 12th)

### Japan Suffers the Impact of the European War, Trade Deficit with Non-Yen Bloc Countries Continues to Increase

Tokyo, Japan's trade with non-yen bloc countries continues to see an increase in the deficit. According to the trade statistics for the first half of 1940 recently released, the deficit for this period was 427,445,000 Japanese yen, an increase of 75,640,000 yen compared to the same period last year. However, trade with yen bloc countries has increased from 24,372,000 yen in the first half of 1939 to 162,251,000 yen, an increase in the surplus of 136,879,000 yen. Trade statistics with countries outside the yen bloc show that Japan has been affected by the European war. The volume of imports and exports was still large before May, but after May, both import and export trade saw a sharp decline. (Reuters telegram on the 14th)

### Japan-France Negotiations Are Wide-Ranging, Japan Does Not Announce the Content of the Japan-Soviet Negotiations

Hong Kong, Tokyo telegram, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs entertained the press, reporters asked about the Japan-France negotiations on the Vietnam issue. A spokesman said that Matsuoka recently replied to the US ambassador's question, saying that the various news about the Japan-France negotiations reported by foreign newspapers were not accurate. However, he admitted that the negotiations between the central governments of Japan and France and between the local Japanese and French authorities were wide-ranging.

Reporters asked whether former Colonial Minister Koiso would be sent as a special envoy to the Dutch East Indies. The spokesman said that judging from the current situation, it seems that there is such a trend, but Koiso has not formally accepted it, so there is no specific decision. (Telegram on the 14th)
