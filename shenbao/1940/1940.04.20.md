Editorial

### Preliminary Work to Stabilize Prices

Since this spring, the trend of soaring prices for all goods has become even more rampant. It is undeniable that this is not a natural rise and fall of prices, but a result of artificial manipulation. Since the price increase began, it has made everyone dazzled by the abnormal development and unexpected wealth currently available, obtained without labor. Therefore, everyone is happily seeking to hoard goods. Speculators are using their surplus funds like racers, chasing goods, not caring whether they are good or bad, but only seeking to obtain them. Therefore, warehouses are full of inventory, but there is little circulation in the market. Hundreds of goods arrive at the port continuously, but prices rise continuously. If the market continues like this, unless those who hoard goods for speculation believe that the opportunity for speculation has passed and dump their goods out of their baskets and crates, there is little hope of stopping it.

This time, the concession authorities cannot be said to be neglecting the general livelihood of the people. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession issued a notice last Saturday (April 13) regarding a table of essential goods, ordering sellers to post the price of the goods on the stall or shop window in a prominent place; and to indicate the price on the goods with a label. If there is any situation of monopoly, manipulation, speculation, or violation of this rule, resulting in a complaint, evidence should be prepared and submitted to the police. Observing the various items in the table, it seems that most of the essential goods for both Chinese and foreigners have been included. If this can be implemented, the minimum effect will be to allow customers to purchase the goods they want at the prices they have set. What has not been seen limited in the handling of this matter is the quality of various goods, which has not been clearly defined. If, in the future, based on the marked prices, a fixed price is further defined, it is difficult to guarantee that inferior goods will not be sold at a high price, just like the price of fish, meat and vegetables, which depends not only on the quality, but also on the freshness, with the price varying accordingly. Since the items to be priced are listed one by one using the enumeration method, those not listed will not be bound by this rule. Some say that the items listed in the table of essential goods can be said to include everything that Westerners eat; and the pricing method is convenient for Westerners trading in beef and mutton shops and candy food grocery stores. However, for Chinese people, the scope of the listed items is too narrow, and it may not be easy to achieve the desired effect when applied to vegetable stalls, shoulder vendors, and oil, wine, cigarette and paper, fish and meat stores. For example, for beef, mutton and pork, the table only lists certain parts of the meat. For vegetables, only French beans are specified. Does this mean that other parts and French beans do not need to be priced? If this interpretation is not wrong, there are many omissions. As for cracking down on manipulation and hoarding, requiring customers to provide evidence is, of course, appropriate in terms of legal principles. However, in reality, there are many obstacles. Moreover, speculation and manipulation are all done by big merchants and wealthy businessmen. Those who transport and sell goods actually cannot manipulate and hoard, and at most only ask for a good price!

We believe that if the Municipal Council is thinking about the overall livelihood of Shanghai, it should seek a broader method in addition to pricing goods, to meet the needs of the public in this extraordinary period. It is also clear that in this kind of situation, it is impossible to solve the difficulties of the general livelihood of the people with the power of the Municipal Council. But apart from the Municipal Council, what can the people of Shanghai expect? The only hope is still to hope that the Municipal Council will shoulder more of this responsibility!

Now that the Hongkou police power issue has been resolved, the efforts made by the Municipal Council to benefit the people's livelihood will easily gain the support of all parties, and the orders of the Municipal Council can now be implemented in all parts of the concession, regardless of whether it is east, west, north, or south. The biggest problem with today's prices is hoarding for speculation; and those who hoard must have a place to hoard, and those who speculate must have a way to speculate. The reason why hoarding dares to be so unscrupulous is precisely because they are like cunning rabbits with three burrows, not hiding here, but hiding there. Therefore, after the unification of police power, since there is no fear of being held back, investigation is easier to carry out, and cracking down is easier to achieve results. If we go one step further, we should select the essential daily necessities, regardless of whether they are stored in public or private stores. They must be required to register the owner of the goods, the type, grade, mark, and quantity of the goods one by one, without charging fees, and the procedures should be handled solely for the convenience of the merchants. When necessary, they may be ordered to submit the bill of lading and warehouse receipt to prove it. The inventory stored by each factory should also be reported, compiled and statistically analyzed to measure the abundance of goods in a place. Some believe that registering the goods stored in the warehouses cannot stabilize prices, but only adds a lot of work to the Municipal Council; but it must be known that hoarding is precisely taking advantage of the non-public nature of inventory, muddying the waters to fish, and doing whatever they want. When inventory is registered one by one, without allowing concealment, although their actions have not been interfered with, they are already wary and dare not speculate excessively. Everything is established in advance, and fails without preparation. This is also the path that must be followed to stabilize prices; it can be done in parallel with pricing goods, and can also complement each other.

### America Focuses All Attention on the Far East: Senate Passes Massive Naval Bill; Builds 50,000-Ton Dreadnoughts in Response to Japan; Naval Chief of Staff Insists on Fortifying Guam

Washington – The United States' emphasis on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific is becoming increasingly apparent. Developments in the past 24 hours have been sufficient to draw attention to the highly secretive naval maneuvers the US is conducting west of Hawaii. It is widely believed that the location of this US naval exercise is closer to the US coast than before, and the exclusion of journalists and photographers from the exercise is also unprecedented. Furthermore, the US Secretary of the Navy personally traveling far from home to review the maneuvers is an even more unusual measure. According to well-informed sources, with the commercial treaty dispute having safely passed through Congress, Secretary of State Hull can now concentrate his full attention on events in the Far East. The proposal for the US Navy's budget of $964,000,000, starting from July 1st of this fiscal year, has now been passed by the Senate and sent back to the House for approval of non-essential amendments. It is noted that this bill includes funding for the construction of two new battleships, each up to 50,000 tons. It is also noted that there are already eight other US battleships under construction. (Reuters, 19th)

Map of the Dutch East Indies

Washington – The Senate yesterday passed the amended naval budget for the next fiscal year, which will soon be transferred to the House of Representatives. It is generally believed that it will not cause significant difficulties in the House. According to this bill, in the coming year, the government will, in addition to continuing the completion of eight battleships, seven cruisers, two aircraft carriers, forty destroyers, twenty submarines, and many other auxiliary vessels already under construction, also commence construction of two new battleships, one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, eight destroyers, six submarines, and many other small warships. Although the official tonnage of these two battleships has not been announced, it is generally believed that they will be 50,000-ton dreadnoughts. Political figures have also stated that the Senate's passage of the naval budget with an overwhelming majority vote is entirely in line with the national desire to increase naval strength so that it can respond to Japan's expansion of power into the South Pacific in the future. (Havas, 18th)

Washington – US Naval Chief of Staff Admiral Stark stated yesterday at the Senate Naval Committee that Japan may have recently built twelve "super-battleships." He re-submitted the funding request to fortify Guam, located 1,200 miles south of Yokohama. Admiral Stark said that Japan may complete four "super-battleships" within this year, and will build another two to four by 1944. Although he expressed doubt about Japan currently building as many as twelve of these "super-battleships," the Navy Department has received this report. He believes that the Navy Department should be allowed to establish a strong air force and submarine base in Guam to serve as an advance scouting post for the fleet. The Navy Department does not intend to establish a major naval base in Guam, "but only wants to establish an air force and submarine base, and a garrison sufficient to consume any potential enemy's ability to invade Guam. At the same time, in the event of war with any power, the island is a key point on the route to the East Indies, China, and Japan. The commercial interests in this area can be maintained for hundreds of years or more." Stark requested that the committee declare to the public that if Guam is not fortified as requested by the Navy, this decision would be a matter of funding and "not because of external defense." Admiral Stark meant that the Navy Department's efforts to avoid opposition from Japan regarding the fortification of Guam have influenced the opinions of the US Congress. "Proper fortification of Guam is sufficient to protect our West Coast, and there are many foreign territories in the Pacific that are beneficial to our country, but unfortunately, we do not own these key points. Therefore, we should make better use of what we do own, namely Guam, Midway Island, Hawaii, and other islands. The fortification of these islands is a very wise move and is done to protect our national interests." Stark added that the establishment of a naval base in Guam, regardless of its size, would be sufficient to consolidate our political position in the Far East. The Navy Department's attitude towards the fortification of Guam is not limited to the issue of protecting the Philippines alone. Regardless of whether the Philippines is independent or not, the base in Guam can guarantee the navy's most favorable position for operations in the Western Pacific, and the defense of Hawaii will also be greatly facilitated. If a major war breaks out in the Atlantic, the navy's two-front combat capabilities would also be guaranteed." Senator Tydings supported Admiral Stark's request for the Navy Department to increase its funding by 25%. Tydings is a member of the Naval Committee and the Insular Affairs Committee, which holds a crucial position in the budget for the development of Guam.

Washington – The United States Senate yesterday passed the naval appropriations bill with 63 votes to 4, totaling $963,797,478. The bill stipulates the construction of two new superbattleships, each of 45,000 tons, dozens of small-scale warships, and 352 naval aircraft, as well as maintaining a naval force of 150,000 and a Marine Corps of 25,000. The naval appropriations bill was passed by a majority in the House of Representatives, and after four hours of debate in the Senate, it was also passed and sent to President Roosevelt for signing. The bill provides $410,183,400 for the purchase of new aircraft, including $5,000,000 for the equipment of the new aircraft carrier "Hornet," which can carry 119 aircraft. In addition, the bill allows the Navy Department to sign contracts worth $25,000,000 for the purchase of new fighter jets. (Taichung Press, 19th)

Washington – President Roosevelt stated last night that Secretary of State Hull's communication is sufficient to indicate the country's concern for the situation in the Far East. He said that for the sake of peace, the United States needs to maintain the status quo throughout the Pacific. (United Press, 19th)

Washington – Secretary of State Hull's statement not to disturb the status quo of the Dutch East Indies has resonated throughout the country. Many feel that no pronouncements from American officials in recent years have received such unanimous national approval. Newspaper headlines mostly read, "America Will Not Allow Japan to Interfere in the Dutch East Indies" and "Hull Warns Japan Not to Disturb the Dutch East Indies." The Baltimore Sun stated that the United States should remain apart from European conflicts, but it would be absurd to say that the United States is not concerned with maintaining the supply of important commodities such as rubber and tin. Even if the United States intends to isolate itself, it cannot isolate itself from rubber, and therefore, the facts are unfavorable to isolation. (Reuters, 19th)

Washington – After Secretary of State Hull issued a statement yesterday explaining the US position on the Dutch East Indies issue, members of both the House and Senate expressed their approval, believing that the US government, under pressure from the European situation, will gradually implement the following policies: (1) Efforts will be made to limit Germany's temporary control over neutral European countries, ensuring that the country's expansion of power does not extend beyond the borders of Europe. (2) Efforts will be made to relieve Britain and France's concerns about maintaining order in the Pacific. (Havas, 19th)

Washington – Diplomatic figures here have commented on Secretary of State Hull's statement yesterday regarding the US attitude on the Dutch East Indies issue, saying that the gist of this statement is twofold: first, to respond to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks, informing them that if Japan attempts to control the Dutch East Indies, under no circumstances will it be tolerated by the United States; second, to warn Germany that if it intends to "protect" the Netherlands, as it did with Denmark, the US government will not tolerate the status of the Dutch East Indies being affected by it. (Havas, 19th)

Pittman Advocates Firm Action: Apply Economic Pressure to Japan

Reno – The chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, stated last night that the US response to Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies should be to implement immediate and decisive economic pressure to restrain Japan. "We hope that Japan will be governed by reason and will not force the United States to impose economic pressure on Japan. The United States only needs to implement economic pressure to stop Japan's actions." Pittman continued, "Secretary of State Hull's communication in Washington is a clear communication explaining US policy. Although it is very firm, it cannot be regarded as containing an offensive nature." It is generally recalled that Hull's communication, supported by President Roosevelt, warned Japan that the United States would oppose any changes to the status quo of the Dutch East Indies.

### British and Norwegian Forces Link Up; Surround German Forces around Bodo; British Troops Land Continuously on Norwegian Coast; Trondheim Plateau to Become Decisive Battlefield; Tense Battles South of Hamar

Luleå, Sweden – News last night reported that more British troops landed both south and north of Bodo, 100 miles south of Narvik. It is reported that British troops have occupied Loding Village at the foot of the Salten Fjord, the Lofoten Islands, and the city of Valvik north of Bodo, and are now beginning to encircle Bodo. It is also reported that British troops landed midway between Trondheim and Bodo to prepare to use this place as a base for attacking Trondheim and capturing the railway between Trondheim and Storlien. (United Press, 19th)

Capital of Sweden – News just received here indicates that the battle situation on the Trondheim front in Norway is favorable to the Norwegian army. The fact that British and French troops have made contact with the Norwegian army there has also been confirmed. The German side is rushing to build defenses near the port and is conscripting Norwegian citizens aged sixteen to fifty to participate in the work. Because the Trondheim airport is inconvenient for landing due to melting snow, it is very difficult for the German army to use aircraft to transport soldiers and ammunition, so it is necessary to have solid defenses. (Havas, 19th)

Paris – Well-informed sources here recently stated that the war in Norway is still in the mobilization phase, and a large-scale war has not yet begun. Therefore, the allied countries are consulting on what intentions they have in northern Norway, how many troops they are sending to Norway, and where they are landing. The Allied Command is keeping it all secret, only saying that the landing site will be determined at the discretion of the commander of the expeditionary force. As for the situation in the past 24 hours, it is quite optimistic. The implementation of Norway's mobilization measures is very good, and the German obstruction is ineffective. The number of Norwegian army personnel has now been greatly replenished, and the strength of resistance has increased accordingly. Although the German army received reinforcements yesterday, and its military equipment is far sharper, it has only made slight progress north of Oslo, due to the increased resistance of the Norwegian army. In short, the German occupied area has not expanded significantly, and the current "front line" is between Elverum and Spilleren. As for Narvik in the north, the German army has been defeated and a part of it has fled into Sweden. (Havas, 19th)

Capital of Sweden – According to news received here, a German team moved south from Trondheim, but immediately retreated because it could not make progress. The Norwegian army is now holding the Siggeren Fortress. Because the fortress is made of granite, it is not very afraid of air raids. The German army's bombing of the fortress with field artillery also caused little damage. According to reporters from Swedish newspapers, disturbances often occur near Oslo. Organized military resistance has ended, but several teams of Norwegian soldiers, carrying old-fashioned weapons, are now wandering in the forests. (Reuters, 19th)

London – A Reuters military reporter stationed in Norway reported that the Norwegian army in Steinkjer, 20 miles north of Trondheim, has reportedly joined forces with the British army. General Weisen of the German army has sent teams to attack in three directions, attempting to seize control of the Trondheim-Oslo railway. However, in order to achieve this goal, the German army must first defeat the Norwegian army in Steinkjer. When assisting allied forces in combat, the rugged terrain of the Norwegian northwest border may be used. This strategy must have someone familiar with the geography there as a guide in order to be effective. Fortunately, the British expeditionary force has found such talents in the Norwegian army. (Reuters, 19th)

Capital of Sweden – According to a Norwegian phone call, the German army in the Trondheim area is currently making hasty preparations to deal with the expected attack by the British and Norwegian forces. The people in central Norway were very optimistic when they heard the news that British troops had landed in Namsos, 80 miles north of Trondheim. According to news from central Norway, it is only a matter of time before the Allied forces launch an offensive. The mobilization of the Norwegian army in the area has been completed. German troops in southern Norway are being continuously transported by large transport aircraft to reinforce them. Another British force in the north is advancing towards Narvik. Part of the city seems to still be under German control. An observer who followed a Norwegian army across the Swedish border claimed that a large team of British troops, including Canadian ski troops, had landed in a bay north of Narvik. The area has good transportation to the south. The team of British troops has an artillery team, while the German troops in the Narvik area do not. British aircraft attacked the airports in Stjørdal and Værnes near Trondheim, destroying five German aircraft. On Friday, British aircraft attacked Trøndelag, destroying seven German aircraft and hitting a gasoline depot with one bomb. (Reuters, 19th)

Capital of Sweden – The armies of Britain and Germany in Norway are advancing towards each other. The first major land battle in the European War is approaching. The steep highlands around Trondheim will become the decisive battlefield for the two armies. The Norwegian army has long been stationed there, waiting in formation, right between the British and German armies. German and Allied troops are arriving in Norway by sea, and tens of thousands are advancing rapidly inland. Aircraft are also constantly transporting reinforcements and various military supplies. It is reported that the outposts of the British and German armies are only a few miles apart, and that both sides have surveyed possible positions and dispatched scouts to observe each other. As for the Norwegian army, it is reported that it has dispatched its staff to the British army so that, in addition to providing military assistance, it can also inform the British army of the detailed terrain and enable them to use it for combat. According to news from the Norwegian front, a Norwegian man who escaped from Trondheim today claimed that the German ten-thousand-ton pocket battleship "Lützow" suddenly ran aground near Trondheim during a battle between the German and Allied fleets. However, this news has not been confirmed by other sources. According to another report, although the British navy has bombarded Narvik with artillery for several days, the German army is still holding the area and has not retreated. (International News Agency, 19th)

Oslo – The area southwest of Oslo, close to the Swedish front, is entirely occupied by German troops. Fifty Norwegian officers and one thousand soldiers were captured. A small number of those who fled to the Swedish border were also detained by the Swedish authorities. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)

Capital of Sweden – According to news received here, late last night, German troops abandoned Slither, a town southeast of Elverum that they had occupied, which is also an important outpost. In addition, battles also took place in Skree and Tangen south of Hamar. In general, the Norwegian and German armies will have a major battle in the Elverum area today or tomorrow. However, the terrain in the area between the city and Hamar is flat, which is beneficial to motorized troops. Although the Norwegian army will resolutely resist, it will not be easy to defend the two places and they may fall into German hands again. At present, the German army is afraid that the British will send troops to the area to assist the Norwegian army, so they are trying their best to destroy the communication lines. (Havas, 19th)

Large Numbers of German Troops Transported to Norway by Airplanes

London – A Norwegian official who had just arrived in England from Norway told a Reuters reporter that large numbers of German troops are arriving in Oslo and Bergen by plane from Denmark every day. Although the sea route is no longer open to the Germans, reinforcements are still being transported by air. It is estimated that the total number of German troops in Norway is about 50,000. German aircraft bombed and strafed with machine guns the Norwegian cabinet members and congressmen hiding in the forest. At that time, he was only fifty yards away from the Norwegian King. Details of the German aircraft's attack on the Norwegian King and other news will be published in the Norwegian White Paper. This book is currently being compiled in London and will be published approximately tomorrow. The Norwegian King was attacked by German aircraft a total of three times, first in Hamar, then in Elverum, and most recently in Nybergsund. The government has now moved to a safe and convenient location and has complete control of the administration. Norway's mobilization is still in progress. Although the youth in the cities occupied by the German army cannot escape to join the army, the impact is minimal. The official also said that the rumors circulating outside about Norwegian officials colluding with the enemy are false. Most of them are not colluding with the enemy. The orders received by the Norwegian army and officials were mostly forged by the Germans. Several generals did not doubt it when they first received the orders, believing that they were issued by the General Staff, ordering them not to resist and not to open fire on the Germans. It was not until the German army opened fire on them that they realized they had been deceived. The official concluded that the so-called puppet government is a complete farce, so it should collapse soon. The Norwegian government has instructed the mayor of Oslo to take over the administrative organs in the area, and a committee organized by the president of the university there and others will assist him. This committee has nothing to do with the Germans, but only performs its duties in the occupied areas where the government cannot temporarily exercise its powers. (Reuters, 19th)

4,000 Norwegian Soldiers Retreat into Swedish Territory

Capital of Sweden – Four thousand Norwegian soldiers retreated into Swedish territory last night in the Värmland area. According to news from Karlstad, the Swedish authorities will build concentration camps to accommodate them. It is reported that the Swedish government plans to evacuate the residents of the town of Arvika near the border and use the empty houses to accommodate Norwegian refugees. (Haitong Telegraph)

New German Troops Arrive Around Trondheim

Berlin – The German Command Headquarters announced this afternoon that enemy warships and transport ships north of Narvik were attacked by German aircraft and suffered heavy damage. A submarine was hit by a bomb and sank immediately. The German army around Trondheim has become even more powerful since the arrival of new troops. The German army near Stavanger and Bergen is developing in all directions. There is no battle in the Kristiansand area. In the Oslo area, the German army continues to advance to the northeast and northwest. The area occupied by the German army southeast of Oslo has been expanded to the Swedish border. In this area, the German army captured countless military weapons and supplies from the Norwegian army, such as 83 cannons, 80 machine guns, 20,000 shells, and 1 million bullets, which can be seen as a glimpse. The German Navy continues to carry out operations to eliminate enemy submarines in the Skagerrak and Kattegat. About three enemy submarines were destroyed. The German army inspected Norwegian military freighters in various ports and found many mines and other military supplies belonging to the British. In the Hardanger Fjord, a German patrol boat sank a Norwegian torpedo boat. There were no major battles on the Western Front today. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)

German Political Circles Boast that Naval Warfare Has Been Revolutionized

Berlin – The theme of discussion in Berlin political circles for several days is the revolution in naval warfare after the Northern European war. The so-called revolution in naval warfare refers to the cooperation of the air force. According to the experience of the Northern European war, those without a superior air force cannot occupy a dominant position in naval power. It is needless to say that the British navy exceeds the German navy, but due to the superiority of the German air force, the British navy cannot exert its effectiveness. Six months after the start of the war, the reason why the British navy could not blockade the German Bight as in the First European War, even Churchill admitted, was because the sharpness of the German air force made British ships too dangerous. Secondly, on April 9, Germany occupied Norway with the help of German reconnaissance and bombing aircraft, which also made the British navy unable to do anything. Berlin political figures pointed out that Germany's current position relies on the army and air force, while Britain's position in the Far East and the Mediterranean depends entirely on the navy.

### Martial Law Declared Throughout the Netherlands; Prime Minister Gerbrandy Broadcasts Speech

The Hague – Dutch Prime Minister Gerbrandy announced in a radio broadcast this afternoon that a state of siege has been extended to the entire Netherlands. Previously, only certain designated areas had declared this state. The Dutch Prime Minister's speech, addressed to the people of the Netherlands proper and its overseas territories, urged people to remain calm and said that the mission they are currently undertaking is to serve neutrality. If they want to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool, they must be prepared to use their good services for the use of all belligerent countries at any time. "We rely entirely on ourselves. We avoid alliances because they may be detrimental to our neutrality, so the government has rejected all offers of assistance or protection from third parties. This principle is equally implemented in our overseas territories." When Dutch Prime Minister talked about many of the government's work, he said that the government intended to increase the national defense strength to the highest level and to use all resources within its powers. All belligerent countries do not need to fear that someone will launch an attack through our territory. Those who fear that we will not be able to defend ourselves or that our neutrality will be undermined by political institutions, I dare to reiterate that the government's policy has long been decided, that is, to maintain neutrality towards all parties. No threat can make us deviate from this goal. All "obstructive aid" will be met with our military resistance. The government has decided to extend the state of siege to the entire country in order to maintain this policy. Please do not panic unnecessarily. (Reuters, 19th)

Dutch Capital – Martial law has just been declared throughout the Netherlands. According to official explanation, this matter was not initially caused by the foreign situation, but its motive was domestic policy. According to general knowledge, extremist parties such as the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party that obey foreign countries will be dissolved by the government. (Havas, 19th)

### Italian Statement: No Hegemonic Intentions in the Mediterranean; Follows a Policy of Cooperation with Related Nations; Advocates a System of International Equilibrium; Rumors of Italy and Germany Forcing Spain to Change Policies

Rome. Gaeda, a spokesperson for Mussolini, wrote in an Italian newspaper that Italy's Mediterranean policy is not one of hegemony but rather a policy of cooperation with all countries, especially those in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean system advocated by Italy must be based on the balance of rights and national power, as well as international guarantees of freedom of action and access. This system also includes Italy's intention to cooperate with Islam, in accordance with its traditional and current policies towards the Mediterranean and Red Seas. (Reuters, 19th)

London. The general public here is now paying attention to Italy's attitude towards the Balkan Peninsula. Some say that Italy is about to invade the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia, which, if true, would inevitably lead to a Mediterranean war. It is also heard that the German and Italian authorities are exerting great pressure on Spain to change its policies. Although the country will not abandon its neutrality for the time being, if Britain and France go to war with Italy, Spain's relationship with Britain and France will likely change accordingly. Furthermore, the British Ambassador to Italy, Loraine, is about to return to his post, demanding that the Italian government explain its true intentions. Political figures also believe that countries along the Mediterranean coast, especially Egypt, as well as the protectorates and mandates of Britain and France, should take all necessary precautionary measures at this time. (Havas, 19th)

London. The Minister of Economic Warfare, Cross, made a speech in Sheffield yesterday. After commenting on Italy's current attitude, officials here generally believe that the speech was very timely, and its wording was accurate and representative of British public opinion. However, Cross's intention was neither to present an ultimatum to Italy nor to demand that it explain its position. In essence, Britain has always adhered to the letter and spirit of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938, and it fully understands Italy's interests in the Balkan countries. However, Britain also has interests in those countries and believes that maintaining peace in that region is in the inherent interests of both Britain and Italy. Furthermore, when representatives from Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Bulgaria held a meeting in the capital of Yugoslavia the other day, they reached an agreement on guaranteeing the safety of navigation on the Danube River. The peace of the Balkan Peninsula seems to have been strengthened as a result. Therefore, the British government has expressed great approval of this meeting. However, recently, Italian newspapers have clearly adopted an anti-British and anti-French attitude, and the Italian government has also made some preparations in the military field. All of this is not welcomed by Britain. It is hoped that Prime Minister Mussolini can still act with a realistic spirit and refrain from acting rashly, so as to avoid further aggravating the current tense situation. This would truly benefit both Britain and Italy. Some say that if Germany were to invade Hungary in the future, Italy would be unable to maintain its neutrality and would then first occupy the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia in order to "protect Italian interests." However, the British and French forces in the Mediterranean, especially their naval power, are extremely strong. No matter how Italy's policy changes drastically, Britain and France can deal with it calmly. (Havas, 18th)

London. According to special dispatches here, the New York Times reported from Berlin that Germany's war in Scandinavia was originally intended to give Italy a good impression. Now, Germany feels disappointed in this regard. Not only did it fail to end this war in one day, but it has dragged on for nine days and is still not over. Hitler originally intended to show off to Mussolini with the victory in Scandinavia and a similar blow on the other front. Now that he cannot, he can only pour all his national military power into seeking success. However, whether this will be convenient strategically and economically is doubtful. (Reuters, 19th)

### Germany and Italy Exchange Military Experts

Rome. According to official announcements, Germany and Italy will exchange military missions, including experts and technicians from various departments of the army. Several German military experts have already arrived in Rome to conduct various visits in order to maintain continuous contact between the German and Italian armies. (Haitong, 19th)

### Italian Senate Scheduled to Discuss Budget

Rome. The Italian Parliament is scheduled to meet on May 6 to continue discussing the budgets of various government departments. Prime Minister Mussolini has ordered that ministers of all departments, including Foreign Minister Ciano, submit reports to the Senate. The session will last eleven days. Except for Sundays and Empire Day on May 9, the Senate will adjourn on May 18. (Haitong, 19th)

### Romania Promulgates Two Prohibitions to Prevent Foreign Spies

Bucharest. The Ministry of Interior has recently issued two orders. One prohibits foreigners of all nationalities from carrying firearms and cameras. Those who possess such contraband items must surrender them to the authorities within three days. The other prohibits foreigners without passports from residing within the country. Hereafter, foreigners wishing to enter the country must personally obtain a passport. (Havas, 19th)

Bucharest. Civilian aircraft will hereafter be prohibited from flying in certain areas within Romania. This air defense zone includes the area within a five-kilometer radius around Bucharest, oil fields, the Galati storage area, and border areas. (Haitong, 19th)

Bucharest. The German Ambassador to Romania, Fabricius, paid a visit to Prime Minister Tatarescu today. It is heard that he drew the Prime Minister's attention to the actions of the British in Bucharest that are detrimental to Germany. The Prime Minister immediately replied that the Romanian government has decided to take necessary measures to crack down on all suspicious individuals. However, the total number of German residents in Bucharest is ten times more than the number of British residents. (Havas, 18th)

### Rumors of Soviet-Romanian Agreement Denied by Romania

Bucharest. The French news agency released a report that the Soviet Union and Romania had signed an agreement to withdraw Soviet and Romanian troops ten kilometers from both sides of the Dniester River. This report has been denied by a spokesperson for the Romanian Ministry of Propaganda. (Haitong, 19th)

### All-India Congress Resolves to Expand Non-Cooperation Movement to Achieve Self-Government; Britain Says It Will Take Countermeasures

Wardha, India. After four days of discussion with Gandhi, the Working Committee of the All-India National Congress has passed a resolution instructing the National Congress in various parts of India to prepare to declare a non-cooperation movement and advising members of the Congress who are unable to undertake the struggle under the strict guidance of the Congress to resign from their positions. The resolution firmly declares that it will fulfill the conditions for civil disobedience proposed by Gandhi, including a provision against violence. (Reuters, 19th)

London. The Under-Secretary of State for India, Woolmer, stated in the House of Commons yesterday during a debate on extending the term of administrative privileges of the provincial governors of India for one year, following the resignation of the Congress cabinets in the Indian provinces, that if a civil disobedience movement occurs in India, the British government is determined to adopt various plans to deal with it. Orderly administration must be maintained, especially during wartime. He believes that the leaders of the All-India National Congress must also recognize this point. The provincial governments of India have not collapsed. Autonomous provinces account for one-third of British India. The meeting between the Viceroy and Gandhi ended in a stalemate, which has greatly disappointed millions of Indians. The British government naturally cannot accept the All-India Congress's demand for complete independence and regrets the All-India Congress's rejection of the status of an overseas dominion. If the British government were to follow the demand of the Congress, it would directly sever the relationship between India and the British Empire. British sovereignty would no longer be seen in the Indian constitution, and Britain's obligations to Muslims, princes, and minorities would be completely abandoned. The Viceroy has clearly expounded the British government's policy of granting India the status of a fully self-governing dominion at the earliest possible opportunity and studying the entire constitutional framework with all parties in India. Unfortunately, this proposal has not been adopted by the Congress Party. (Reuters, 19th)

Tokyo. General Koiso, the Minister of Colonial Affairs, has decided to establish an agency in the South Sea Islands to handle Japan's economic development in the South Seas and promote industrial products, while also collecting economic data on the various islands in the South Seas and reporting it to the government at any time.

### Caspian Sea Level Drops Annually; Soviet Union Seeks Remedial Measures

Moscow. The Caspian Sea level is currently dropping every year. The Soviet Academy of Sciences is trying to remedy this situation. It is said that in the past twenty years, the Caspian Sea level has dropped by one and a half meters. At the same time, due to the construction of the Kuibyshev Dam on the Volga River, the sea level will inevitably drop further. According to Grigoriev, the head of the Department of Geography, the only remedy is to isolate the Caspian Sea from some shallow bays by various means. (Tass, 19th)

### Japan's Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministries Hold Joint Meeting; No Criticism of Hull's Declaration; Arita Describes Course of Dutch-Japanese Negotiations; Tokyo Newspapers Publish Fiercely Anti-American Arguments

Tokyo. Senior officials from Japan's Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministries held a joint meeting and decided to completely ignore the message issued yesterday by U.S. Secretary of State Hull, in which he asked all countries, especially Japan, to respect the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters today that they believed any criticism of Hull's remarks would be superfluous, as the discussions between Japan and the Netherlands regarding the Dutch East Indies had completely clarified Japan's intentions. The spokesperson expressed satisfaction with the reply of Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens to the remarks of Japanese Ambassador to the Netherlands Ishii. It is said that Kleffens indicated that the Dutch government understands the Japanese government's attitude towards the issue of the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Kleffens explained that the Dutch government has not sought protection of the Dutch East Indies from any country, nor will it do so in the future. The Dutch government is determined to reject any offer of protection or intervention that may be made by other countries. One reporter stated that Arita's remarks on Sunday assumed that the Netherlands might be drawn into a war, causing the Dutch government to cease exercising power in the Dutch East Indies. In that case, the Japanese government would recognize the local authorities of the islands. The spokesperson replied that Arita's remarks not only referred to a special development in the overall situation but also any development that would affect the status quo of the Dutch East Indies as the European war expanded. Furthermore, he clarified that the islands are not a colony of the Netherlands but a part of Dutch territory. Therefore, even if the Netherlands is ruled by a belligerent country or several belligerent countries, it does not mean that the Dutch East Indies will disappear from the map. In addition, he was unwilling to add further criticism of the hypothetical situation. Asked whether any negotiations were underway between Japan and the Netherlands, the spokesperson answered in the affirmative. (Reuters, 19th)

Tokyo. After U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement yesterday regarding the Dutch East Indies, Japanese newspapers have responded to it with mostly hostile arguments. The Asahi Shimbun stated that the United States' attitude is quite unfriendly and incomprehensible, with an unnecessary air of intervention in Western Pacific affairs. The Hochi Shimbun stated that the United States, which must speak out on everything, has now issued another statement, reiterating its arbitrary international views and citing treaties that are clearly in conflict with Japanese theories. It considers Japanese theories to be the only way to correct the injustices of the Far East and the world, and that peace cannot be achieved without a new and just order. Undoubtedly, Hull's statement is intended to politically obstruct Japan's southward policy, but the United States must know that this attempt will only anger the Japanese people. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the possible foreign occupation of the Dutch East Indies is a balloon to test how various countries will react to this issue. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that although both Tokyo and Washington have repeatedly stated their desire to see the status quo maintained, their positions are vastly different. Japan has a fundamental policy of stabilizing that part of the world, just as the United States has its Monroe Doctrine. (Reuters, 19th)

### Britain and America Consult Frequently to Deal with Far Eastern Situation

London. The remarks made by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita earlier this week regarding the Dutch East Indies became the subject of questions in the House of Commons last night. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Graham asked the government to guarantee that it would not, when the war zone extends to the Netherlands, allow Japan to unilaterally maintain maritime peace in the Dutch East Indies. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that, to the best of Foreign Secretary Halifax's knowledge, the Japanese government has not requested sole responsibility for maintaining maritime peace in that area. Arita told reporters that the Japanese government must be deeply concerned about any development that would affect the status quo of the Dutch East Indies as the European war expands. At the same time, the British government holds a similar view on this issue, which is probably needless to say. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Morgan asked whether Chamberlain would guarantee that Britain would consult with the U.S. government and adopt mutually agreeable policies if the war continues to affect developments in the Far East. Butler replied that the British government has always kept the U.S. government informed of all events that affect the common interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East. However, the future policy of the United States in that region must, of course, be decided solely by the U.S. government. (Reuters, 19th)

### Japan Still Plans to Resolve Various Issues with U.S. and Soviet Union

Tokyo. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry told reporters today that the Japanese government's expectation of resolving all outstanding issues between Japan and the United States in a timely manner has not changed. Asked about reports that the new Soviet Consul-General in Harbin is advocating a complete readjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations, the spokesperson replied that Tokyo has not yet received information regarding this matter. (Reuters, 19th)

### Restrictions on Immigration in the Philippines Deal a Serious Blow to Japan

Tokyo. Mr. Suma, the spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, recently told the press that if the Philippine immigration bill is based on population issues, Japan will not oppose it. However, the immigration of people from other countries to the Philippines is clearly not as large as that of people from China and Japan. Therefore, the bill is actually restricting Chinese and Japanese people. Suma also stated that in the past few years, an average of more than 2,800 Japanese people have immigrated to the Philippines each year. If the immigration bill is implemented, Japanese immigration will be limited by one-fifth, as the bill only allows 500 people to immigrate from each country each year. This is a serious blow to Japan. (United Press, 19th)

### U.S. Asiatic Fleet Makes Summer Transfer; Flagship Leaves Philippines for Shanghai

Manila. The U.S. Asiatic Fleet began its summer transfer this week. The fleet's flagship, the USS Augusta, left the Philippines yesterday for Shanghai. Mr. Sayre, the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, is traveling to Shanghai on the ship. Admiral Hart, the Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, and the submarine tender USS Canopus, along with six submarines, have set off and are en route along the Chinese coast. Other warships are preparing to set sail for China within the week. Several destroyers, six submarines, and fourteen reconnaissance aircraft are patrolling the territorial waters of the Philippines, maintaining neutrality. People here are very interested in U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement regarding the Dutch East Indies. Some believe that the statement is the attitude that the United States will take if the Philippines is threatened. Philippine independence activists say that if the United States is concerned about the welfare of Dutch territories, it should be doubly concerned about the welfare of the Philippines, which the United States has been working to make independent for forty years. (United Press, 19th)

### Dutch East Indies Capable of Self-Defense; Has Built Powerful Air Force

Amsterdam. Last night, the official news agency here stated that the Dutch government has informed the Japanese government, stating that if the Netherlands is unfortunately drawn into the war, the Netherlands will not need to request protection of the Dutch East Indies from a foreign country. The official report emphasizes that if the Netherlands participates in the war, the Dutch East Indies will be legally and factually capable of self-defense. (Haitong, 19th)

Manila. American military observers who have recently returned from Java said that the conquest of the East Indies is even more difficult than that of the Philippines. They stated that the Dutch East Indies has recently built a powerful air force, which is unmatched in the Far East except for Japan. The air force includes 150 American bombers and other American-style aircraft, which are piloted by well-trained Dutch pilots. The observers said that the large-scale fortification of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies in the past two years has not been noticed by most people in the world. (United Press, 19th)

### British Commerce in China Suffers Discrimination; Members of Parliament Urge Government to Pay Attention

London. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Graham asked in the House of Commons yesterday whether the discriminatory treatment of British shipping in places such as Qingdao is the responsibility of the Japanese Asia Development Board. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied in writing that, in his opinion, pointing out that the actions that discriminate against British interests are the responsibility of a certain Japanese party is of no help. Whenever such discrimination occurs, the British government always negotiates with the appropriate Japanese authorities or directly with the Japanese government. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Morgan stated that the Japanese authorities in Qingdao recently asked a certain American company why it was using British ships to load goods and claimed that if the next shipment still uses non-Japanese ships, the Japanese side will not provide the same conveniences as Japanese ships. He continued this action is evidence of a policy to eliminate British commerce in the Far East. The British government should negotiate with the Japanese government. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler also submitted a written reply, stating that Foreign Secretary Halifax has paid attention to this matter but has not yet obtained conclusive evidence. Recently, it seems that there have been frequent campaigns to persuade cargo owners not to load British ships. The government is currently giving active consideration to this entire matter. (Reuters, 19th)

London. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Knox asked in the House of Commons yesterday about the import trade in Hankou, asking the Prime Minister whether he was aware that the import trade in Hankou was monopolized by the Japanese and that the scope was gradually expanding. He also asked what measures the government planned to take to restore and protect British commerce in the interior of China. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that, according to recent information, although tung oil is being shipped to the United States, trade in Hankou is currently still stagnant. Even if there is a small amount of trade, it is in the hands of the Japanese. The British government is eager to have the restrictions currently encountered by British trade removed as soon as possible and has already brought this matter to the attention of the Japanese government. (Reuters, 19th)

### American Traitors Active in Secret; Penetrate Important Industries; Congressional Investigation Report

Washington. Congressman Dies, Chairman of the Committee Investigating Un-American Activities, recently stated that members of the Nazi Party and the Communist Party have penetrated important American industries for the purpose of sabotage and espionage. These industries are crucial to the survival of the United States and the Allied countries in wartime. The committee is currently investigating the matter and will show that the situation of domestic traitors in the United States is even worse than that in Norway. (Reuters, 19th)

### Japan Competes with America in Shipbuilding; Yoshida Claims to Be Confident

Tokyo. The New York Times recently published a report that Japan is currently building multiple super battleships, the power of which exceeds that of the warships of other countries. Japanese naval figures believe that this statement is "propaganda carried out by the United States, the purpose of which is to stimulate domestic public opinion in favor of the country's continued expansion of its navy." The naval staffs of various countries often keep secret information obtained about Japan's shipbuilding plans. This is no different from Japan's efforts to avoid leaking shipbuilding secrets. Therefore, it is still difficult to know for sure whether Japan is building such battleships. However, according to the views of foreign authorities, this shipbuilding plan is "quite possible." Regarding this matter, there is often a special atmosphere of optimism whenever naval issues are involved in the recent meetings of the Japanese House of Representatives. In particular, when the House of Representatives discussed the impact that the U.S. Vinson Naval Act could have on Japan, Navy Minister Yoshida seemed very confident in Japan's naval power. At that time, several members of the House of Representatives raised inquiries, saying they didn't know whether the implementation of Japan's planned Fourth Naval Expansion Plan (from 1939 to 1943, which is to supplement the Third Plan from 1937 to 1941) will be disrupted due to the U.S. Vinson Plan. Navy Minister Yoshida immediately replied, "We have made a thorough study of the U.S. shipbuilding plan and have concluded that there is no need to worry. There is no need for Japan to respond immediately. The House of Representatives only needs to approve the budget requested by the Ministry of the Navy." Although the above situation is only a psychological sign, it is also something worth noting. (Havas, 18th)

### Japanese Side Declares Tianjin Concession Blockade Can Be Lifted Automatically; Rumors of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Nearing Resolution; Anti-British Movement Has Not Yet Ceased

Tianjin. The organ newspaper of the Japanese military authorities here reported that the lifting of the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concessions is only a matter of time. Based on the negotiations between Britain and Japan, especially after the meeting between British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki on the 13th of this month, there has been rapid development. Therefore, the Tianjin issue is expected to be fully resolved by the end of this month or the beginning of May. The current negotiations are only related to minor incidents. The resolution of the silver issue, including the silver deposited in the French concession, is also included. After discussions in Tokyo, the British and Japanese authorities in Tianjin will determine the final details of the agreement to be concluded. The Japanese military authorities in the city are preparing to lift the blockade when the agreement is signed. The silver deposited in the two concessions will be kept in custody by a joint committee representing China, Britain, Japan, France, and the United States. The silver in the British concession, worth 14 million yuan, will have 100,000 British pounds allocated for relief purposes. (Reuters, 19th)

Tianjin. Regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin issue, which are currently being conducted between Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki and British Ambassador to Japan Craigie, the central issue of the silver problem will be resolved soon. The negotiations between Japan and France will also be able to proceed due to the overall resolution of the Japanese-Japanese negotiations. In addition, these minor negotiations between Japan and Britain and Japan and France will be conducted locally. After all procedures are completed, the Japanese side may automatically withdraw the restrictions on isolating traffic to and from the concessions. (Domei News Agency, 19th)

Beiping. The Xinmin Bao recently published a work report from March by the "Chinese People's Anti-British Movement Committee" in Beiping. According to the report, during this period, the committee investigated 50 shops to determine if they had British goods and warned two Chinese landlords not to renew leases with British residents and to evict them as soon as possible. As a result, three British residents have been evicted. In addition, the committee warned Chinese people working in British barracks, the British Embassy, British trading companies, and British private residences, urging them to resign immediately. At the same time, it established a relief department to seek welfare for workers who have left their British employers. However, only one worker registered in March. This person requested the Social Affairs Bureau to find him other work. (Havas, 18th)

### Chongqing Offers Large Reward for Arresting Spies

Chongqing. The Garrison Headquarters here recently announced that anyone who provides information leading to the capture of Japanese spies and the confiscation of their radio transmitters will be rewarded with 100,000 yuan. The Garrison Headquarters took this action because of reports that Japanese spies in Chongqing are using mobile radio transmitters to communicate with the Japanese, reporting weather conditions and valuable military intelligence.

### Slim Chances of Opening Kuling This Summer: An Observation from a Foreign Resident

Hankou: According to the opinion of a foreign resident who recently inspected the situation at Kuling, the possibility of reopening Kuling this summer is quite slim. The Sino-Japanese war has caused many difficulties and disrupted everything. The primary difficulty is the transportation problem of traveling to Kuling, traversing the plains and climbing the mountains. Ships, vehicles, and laborers have all been requisitioned for military needs, leaving only a few sedan chairs. The issue of supplies for those seeking summer retreat is also a major obstacle. As the rural areas have been disrupted by the war, food, fuel, and labor are difficult to obtain. The new Kuling Management Office is currently compiling a list of landowners, as the former Lushan Management Bureau took all records with them. Landowner registration is now underway, but many landowners have left, and communication is poor, hindering the registration process. (19th Reuters dispatch)

### German White Paper, Thirteenth Document

Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry yesterday released the thirteenth document from the Polish archives, a report from the Polish Ambassador to Sweden, Potołowski, to the Polish Foreign Minister, dated April 15, 1939. The original text is as follows: "The British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, declared here yesterday that his trip had not achieved many successes. Mr. Hudson's remarks seemed somewhat lacking in tact, causing resentment among economic figures here. A certain prominent Swedish financier told me that, based on Mr. Hudson's view of Sweden's attitude, should war break out in the future, Sweden should prohibit the export of all raw materials to Germany. This interpretation by Swedish figures suggests that Sweden is willing to maintain neutrality, but if Germany controls the Baltic Sea, Sweden would be unable to refuse the export of ore to Germany. During a meeting with reporters, Mr. Hudson strongly stated that Sweden should increase its exports to England. If the economic delegation cannot achieve its goals, then England will demand revisions to the existing trade agreement. Swedish economic figures believe this statement is unacceptable. Even if England does not buy Swedish steel and agricultural tools, Sweden can find better markets in Germany. Regarding Anglo-Swedish trade relations, the 'Tidningen' newspaper published an editorial on April 13, stating that the imported goods that England buys from Sweden are mostly raw materials and manufactured goods essential to British industry, the value of which is lower than the domestic Swedish market by as much as 60 percent. From Sweden's standpoint, it is hoped that this system can be abolished so that domestic prices can be brought back to normal." Signed, Polish Ambassador to Sweden, Potołowski.

### The Passing of Song Zheyuan: Developed Hemiplegia in Guizhou, Moved to Sichuan for Recuperation, Sadly Perished

Chengdu Air Mail: General Song Zheyuan passed away on the 5th of this month at the Yong'an Apartment in Mianyang. Upon hearing the sad news, everyone was deeply saddened. Song developed hemiplegia in Guiyang in the winter of the year before last. Subsequently, on June 3rd of last summer, he passed through Chongqing and Chengdu to Guanxian for recuperation. On March 11th of this year, he moved to Mianyang for medical treatment, but because the illness had reached an advanced stage, medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away. He lived in Sichuan for convalescence for a total of ten months. Few know about his daily life. The following is an account of his life as described by Yang Wenqing, a friend of Song:

Song was originally in good health. In the winter of the 27th year, he traveled to Guiyang on official business and caught a cold. One day, when Japanese planes attacked Guiyang, he and Councilor Zhao Xinru and others went to a mountain temple near Guiyang for temporary shelter. He was lightly dressed while ill, and the mountain wind exacerbated his condition. Within a few days, it turned into hemiplegia. After seeking medical treatment, he slightly recovered, but movement of his limbs remained inconvenient. In May of last year, he traveled from Guiyang to Chongqing. Upon the doctor's advice for long-term recuperation, he went to Guanxian for convalescence.

On June 5th, Song went to Guanxian and resided near the Guanhong Pavilion outside Dongguan. His new residence was built in advance by Deng Zhexi and others. The residence consisted of three courtyards, a small building, and several thatched huts, with ten acres of land developed into a garden with bamboo fences and thatched cottages, which was quite elegant. In addition to his wife and fifth and sixth daughters, old friends and staff members Zhao Xinru, Deng Zhexi, Qin Dechun, Yang Zhennan, Zhang Yueting, Lü Runzhai, and Deng Jian were also present. Song entertained himself by planting flowers and trees, and rare flowers and plants filled the garden.

After living in the countryside for more than a month, his illness slightly improved, and he suddenly felt the urge to travel, climbing Qingcheng Mountain. He stayed in the mountains for five days, touring scenic spots. He occasionally spoke with Taoist priests and became interested in Taoist teachings. He returned home with many volumes of Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Taoist scriptures for reading and study, and began practicing meditation for self-cultivation. While living in Guanxian, he occasionally stayed in Chengdu for medical treatment.

In October of last year, Song's blood pressure rose. He came to Chengdu to seek treatment from Qi Jinan, the president of the National Central University Medical College, and gradually improved after half a month. In late February of this year, a Western medical examination revealed that he had a stomach bleeding disease. Many friends believed that the water quality in Guanxian was not suitable for Song's health and decided to move to Mianyang. They leased the entire Yong'an Apartment on Yanshi Street. On March 11th, he moved to Mianyang. After living there for ten days, his blood pressure increased further, and his illness worsened. Song's old mother is already eighty years old and still lives in the North. Song's illness was severe, and he was saddened that he could not serve his elderly mother, and he and his wife wept together. Starting from the 26th, he was unable to eat. In three days, he only consumed half a cup of milk and boiled water. From the 30th to the 4th of this month, he fell unconscious several times. He passed away from his illness at 2:00 PM on the 5th. During his illness, Song still hoped to recover soon and return to the front lines.

At the time of his death, Qin Dechun, Deng Zhexi, Yang Zhennan, and others rushed to Mianyang. Song told Qin and others that the War of Resistance had not yet achieved final victory. As a soldier, he was unable to fulfill his duties and serve on the battlefield, a regret that could not be erased.

While Song was convalescing in Guanxian, he donated 13,000 yuan, using 7,000 yuan to establish an orphanage in Guanxian and 6,000 yuan to establish a poor people's hospital.

### Auxiliary Coin Shortage in Jiangyin: Copper Coins Converted to Legal Tender

Jiangyin Correspondence: The turmoil in our county, Yu Rong, has intensified recently. Previously, due to the lack of auxiliary coins, stamps were used as substitutes, but they were easily soiled, and the business community unanimously refused to use them. Then, a copper coin was temporarily used as one cent of auxiliary currency for circulation, but it was soon rejected again. Disputes arose between stores and customers, and small merchants and common people suffered the most. The other day, stores in the city consulted on relief measures and decided that one copper coin would be used as one cent, which seemed inappropriate. In order to take both sides into consideration, according to the previous practice of 130 copper coins per yuan, a compromise was reached to convert 150 copper coins into one yuan of legal tender, that is, 15 copper coins as one dime of legal tender. Starting from the 15th, copper coins in the market will be universally circulated, but they cannot be used in full. For example, three to seven are used together. If there are 15 copper coins, they can be used as one dime of legal tender, and three copper coins can be used as two cents of auxiliary coins. As for the copper coin notes issued by the Provincial Finance Department, the people mostly distrust and do not use them.

### Qinghai-Mongolian-Tibetan Cultural Promotion Association Actively Promotes Mongolian and Tibetan Education: Plans to Establish Six Elementary Schools and Translate Tibetan Textbooks

(Xining Correspondence) In order to promote Mongolian and Tibetan education, the Mongolian and Tibetan Cultural Promotion Association has recently established one Mongolian and Tibetan elementary school in each of the districts of Sanjiao City in the Haidong Administrative Bureau, Yuanqunke Wutu, Right Wing League Haza, Qunke Banner Shanghudanpi, and Tuer Shihuachu Mang, and appointed Tong Quhu as the chief preparatory member of the Zizang Elementary School in Sanjiao City, Haidong; Zhang Tingwei, Cang Huaizhi, and Liu Tongji as preparatory members; Bao Yongde as the chief preparatory member of the Wutu Mongolian and Tibetan Elementary School in Huangyuan Qunke Banner; Yang Siliang, Wang Yu'an, and Ma Baoshan as preparatory members; Lin Qin Zhafal as the chief preparatory member of the Right Wing League Ha Mongolian and Tibetan Elementary School; Ma Suonan, Ma Shengtai, and Fang Yannian as preparatory members; Qi Huajie Danliqicai Dili as the preparatory member of the Shanghudanpi Mongolian and Tibetan Elementary School in Qunke Banner; Mang Qianduo Jie as the preparatory member of the Tuer Shi Mongolian and Tibetan Elementary School; Duo Cai Dan Li Shengrong as the preparatory member of the Weimang Mongolian and Tibetan Elementary School in Hualong County; and Tang Yongqi as the Chinese teacher of the school.

Chairman Ma Zixiang of the Association, considering that the Mongolian and Tibetan people in various places are not proficient in Chinese language, making teaching difficult, ordered Councilors Luosang Xiangqu and Sangre Jiacuo to translate two kinds of elementary school Chinese language common sense textbooks into Tibetan textbooks starting last year to make them the reading materials for students in schools in various Mongolian and Tibetan areas in the province. Now the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh volumes of Chinese language and the first, second, third, and fourth volumes of common sense have been translated. The translated first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh volumes of Chinese language have been proofread by Grand Master Xirao of the National Five Universities Tibetan Culture Lecture and Secretary General Xianrong of the Provincial Government and are now being engraved on wooden blocks by the Association to prepare for mass printing for distribution to Mongolian and Tibetan school students. In the future, when this translation is completed, it will surely have a great effect on the promotion of Mongolian and Tibetan education in this province. It is also heard that after the completion of this translation, the Association plans to first distribute it to elementary school students in various Mongolian and Tibetan areas in the mainland, and after they graduate from elementary school, they will be sent to Mongolian and Tibetan elementary schools in the province to study Chinese and Tibetan languages as teachers for promoting Mongolian and Tibetan education in the future, and to plan for the development of Mongolian and Tibetan education in this province. Overseas schools that have not been registered should apply for registration as soon as possible.

### Overseas School Students Returning to China: The Motherland Gives Preferential Treatment: Overseas Schools That Have Not Been Registered Should Apply for Registration as Soon as Possible

(Chongqing Air Mail) In recent years, many overseas Chinese schools in various places have applied to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for registration. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in addition to providing various guidance and encouragement to all registered overseas Chinese schools, also provides appropriate assistance in terms of teachers, books, instruments, and cash within the scope of its financial capabilities to those who are indeed outstanding in academic performance or have other difficulties. Moreover, students who graduate from these schools and return to China for further studies are given special preferential treatment and introduced to schools according to their wishes. In addition, elementary school diplomas from registered overseas Chinese schools must be verified and sealed by the local consulate, and middle school diplomas must be verified and sealed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Those who hold such verified and sealed diplomas will be given special preferential treatment and lenient admission when returning to China for further studies or transferring to domestic schools. Given this situation, all unregistered overseas schools should apply to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for registration as soon as possible in order to obtain direct guidance from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and their graduates can also obtain various conveniences when returning to China for further studies or transferring.

### The Third Mobile Drama Education Team Is Now Teaching in Kunming

(Kunming Air Mail) The Third Mobile Drama Education Team of the Ministry of Education, since its establishment in Chongqing the year before last, has been led by Yu Wen and Wang Mianzhi to work in the four provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Kangding in the Southwest. The team believes that to engage in anti-Japanese construction propaganda, it is necessary to deeply engage in rural areas with a spirit of perseverance to complete a truly national mobilization. Therefore, the team has been working hard for more than a year, earnestly deeply engaging in the villages and towns of the southwestern rear areas, especially in the Miao area, where the results have been the greatest. They often live with the Miao compatriots and engage in education, sometimes deeply engaging in the wilderness and bandit areas of various counties, using the power of cultural education to persuade compatriots to participate in the War of Resistance. The work takes various forms, such as giving medicine and diagnosis, etc., to closely approach the masses. They also use various realistic themes to create scripts and songs, aiming at the actual living conditions of farmers to achieve the purpose of propaganda and education. The team also regularly jointly organizes training classes such as drama, singing, and literacy with local governments. In the past year, the work areas have included Qijiang in Sichuan, Zunyi in Guizhou, Aiyang, Anshun Panxian, and each place has worked for more than three months. The team also mimeographs a "Newsletter" to report on the social conditions and work realities in remote areas. In February of this year, they went to Kunming from Guizhou to participate in military labor performances and to entertain the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Repatriation Comfort Group that passed through Yunnan. They also successively performed five dramas related to anti-Japanese construction, which were highly admired and respected by the audience.

### Current Situation of the Guizhou Provincial Science Museum

(Guiyang Correspondence) In order to promote the development of science education in the province and popularize scientific knowledge among the general public, and to prepare for the experiments of middle school students, the Guizhou Provincial Government obtained a construction fee subsidy of 70,000 yuan from the Management Committee of the British Boxer Indemnity Fund and a preparatory fee subsidy of 5,000 yuan from the China Education and Culture Foundation Board of Directors. The Department of Education has hired Zhang Zhihan and other 12 people as preparatory committee members and tendered bids for the construction of the museum building. The total construction fee is more than 100,000 yuan. A three-story building with a lecture hall and meeting room, storage rooms for biological, physical, and chemical experiments, and research rooms of each type is built with equipment that can simultaneously accommodate 50 students for experiments. For the special equipment for physics, it is planned to purchase various materials and build another workshop, dividing it into gold work, carpentry, sand casting, and simple instrument and equipment manufacturing and repair departments. There will also be a soil and mineral analysis laboratory and a commodity inspection laboratory to study the development of raw materials and the improvement of products in Guizhou Province. Other activities, such as holding popular science lectures, propaganda, improving the general public's scientific level, and editing scientific books and publications to introduce new knowledge and propose special topics for discussion, will be held separately one after another.

### The Jingwu Cup Sees Another Upset: Huang Fen Defeats Old Ma to Win the Seventh Group Championship

The Third Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Tournament held the knockout round of the seventh group yesterday. More than 300 people attended. The first group was seeded player Ma Tingliang against newcomer Huang Fen. The former was the runner-up in the previous tournament, and the latter was originally named Huang Fufu. Huang was eliminated by Ma in the preliminary round last year. After a year, Huang was eager to avenge his defeat, so the competition was fierce and unwilling to give in. The two sides tied each other at two games each. In the final game, Huang was strong and took the lead with a score of 9 to 5. Unexpectedly, Old Ma was determined to fight to the end and relied on his steady shots to tie the score at 10 to 10. Under the switch of serve, Ma took the lead with one point. Huang did not flinch under this situation and won three points in a row to win 13 to 11. In conclusion, Huang eliminated Old Ma 3 to 2, avenging his defeat last year. Old Ma has been a dominant figure in the table tennis world for ten years, but he lost to a newcomer due to a single point, which was unexpected. Afterwards, Huang Fei took advantage of the remaining power and defeated Fei Chunhua, a skilled chopper, and faced Gu, a hard hitter, in the final. Gu was brave but lacked strategy. Huang defeated Gu 3-0 to win the seventh group championship. The results of the final are recorded as follows:

### Proposed Tax Increase Will Cause Rent Disputes: Like Dropping a Bomb: Future Hidden Dangers Are Worrying

The Annual Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers has hastily passed the tax increase proposal, and ratepayers within the district feel disappointed. According to Fan Kelin's report at the Annual Meeting, "After repeated consideration, the Board has decided to uniformly levy a surcharge of 50% on the current tax rate starting from July 1st of this year. At the same time, the surcharge for various license fees will be increased from 10% to 50% to supplement funds." This is the content of the tax increase proposal. Ratepayers will be bearing a 50% tax increase in two months.

A Rent Uprising Is About to Erupt

According to a certain ratepayer, the passage of the tax increase proposal is like dropping a heavy bomb on the rent issue. Rent disputes will continue to surge. We point our fingers at the sub-landlords who take advantage of the situation to increase rents to third-party tenants. The passage of the tax increase now provides an even greater excuse. The increased taxes for stores will inevitably be passed on to customers, and the increased taxes for landlords will inevitably be passed on to tenants. Therefore, the final burden will still be on the general public. Furthermore, the increase in land taxes will cause real estate owners to continue to increase rents to sub-landlords, and as rents increase, taxes will also increase. Alas, ordinary people truly have no way to make a living.

Western Newspaper Comments on Bus Price Increases

Today's Millard's Review published an article criticizing the Municipal Council and believing that although the Municipal Council currently claims to reduce the cost of living in this city in order to solve the residents' livelihood problems, in reality, we find it difficult to have a good impression of this, because the Municipal Council's "right hand seems to completely disregard what its left hand is doing." The article cites the British-owned

Public Bus

The problem of price increases as an example, saying that "Last Sunday, the Municipal Council issued a statement saying that speculators have already caused serious consequences, but on the same day, the British-owned Public Bus Company, which holds the exclusive franchise in the International Settlement, also announced a 45% price increase. The Municipal Council has naturally approved this matter. The reasons cited by the Public Bus Company are nothing more than the soaring prices of bus

Raw materials

and the recent increase in employees' salaries. Although the British-owned Public Bus Company has not been able to restore its operations in the Hebei District of Suzhou, since 1937, its operating conditions have been better than in the past. If the Municipal Council has the goal of reducing prices in order to maintain the livelihood of residents, and wants to make the residents of the Concession understand that the Municipal Council has indeed engaged in some

Specific measures, then why not stop the price increase of public buses? The inside story is very easy to understand. Moreover, the salaries of most of the foreign employees of the company are paid in foreign currency. The decline in the value of the local currency is regarded by the company as a major loss, because its income is all in legal tender." The article also believes that the only way to solve the current difficulties is to avoid making residents feel

Too burdened. However, the Municipal Council must not nationalize public buses and should aim to operate for the benefit of the public. We suggest that the only solution is to cancel its exclusive franchise and allow the establishment of other public bus companies. In a competitive environment, there may be a little help.

### Retirement of Mr. Flander in the Future, Temporarily Not Leaving Shanghai, Plans to Engage in Freelance Work

Mr. Flander, the British head of the Intelligence Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told reporters yesterday that he would retire on the first of next month. He intends to rest for a few months, after which he will take up another occupation. However, he said that he would not leave Shanghai, as he has lived in Shanghai for over thirty years. Regarding his future, there are currently no concrete plans, but he hopes to write for various newspapers and magazines and engage in freelance work. He said, "I was originally a news reporter. After a few months of vacation, I eagerly wish to resume my leisurely pursuit." He also mentioned that he studied journalism in England. He came to Shanghai in 1911 and engaged in the news business. During the World War, Mr. Flander served in the military. After the war ended, he returned to Shanghai to resume his work. He joined the Shanghai Municipal Council in 1920.

### Atrocities by Japanese Troops in the Suburbs of Shanghai: Zhudi Town Completely Burned, Japanese Troops Driving Tanks to Loot, Forcibly Abducting Women and Killing Three Hundred Villagers

The English-language "China Press" reported that guerrillas active in western Shanghai have been carrying out activities in recent days. This morning (the 19th), the Japanese army retaliated by setting fire to houses in Zhudi Town, located only a few miles from Hongqiao Airport, abducting women, and firing on villagers who tried to escape. The guerrillas then engaged the Japanese army. Residents of Hongqiao heard the sounds of rifles, machine guns, and even cannons. The fighting ceased at 5:00 AM.

Japanese Troops Set Fire

Around 2:00 AM today (the 19th), Japanese troops arrived in multiple trucks, accompanied by twelve tanks, and drove along the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway, turning into Zhudi Town by the Suzhou River. They blamed the villagers for harboring guerrillas and immediately set fire to the town, intending to burn the entire town to the ground, hoping to capture the guerrillas. Zhudi Town is a center for rice and egg businesses. Also, yesterday (the 18th), two wounded women and children came to Shanghai for medical treatment. It is believed that two Japanese soldiers were killed (the two Japanese soldiers were in Baocai Village - transliteration) and wounded during the retaliation. The Japanese army killed them by more than twenty guerrillas. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army dispatched a large force to Baocai Village on the nights of the 15th and 16th.

Slaughter to Vent Anger

They opened fire on villagers who tried to escape, in order to vent their anger. The people who were killed as many as two hundred. It was reported that after the Chinese mobile units fought with the Japanese army in western Shanghai last Saturday and Sunday, the Japanese army believed that the villagers were harboring guerrillas and providing food. They burned villages and towns in the Shanghai region, falsely accusing farmers of being guerrillas, arresting them, and shooting them. Many farmers were killed, some say more than a hundred.

The Local Area Is Devastated

According to reports, yesterday morning (the 18th), a dense fog obscured the sky. About three miles north of Shanghai in the west, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were seen coming from the Jiading direction, all in plain clothes, heading southwest. Wherever they passed, people scrambled to avoid them. Later, the Japanese troops entered the Qingpu County border west of Zhudi and indiscriminately fired their guns and burned and killed at will. They also insulted the women before killing them. The brutality was especially severe at the beginning. According to farmers in the area, the Xu pseudo-troops recently falsely accused the people of Qingpu County of being reserve guerrillas, leading to Japanese troops from various areas, such as Qingpu, Sijing, Beixinjing, Nanxiang, and Huangbo, gathering in the area in plain clothes for the same operation. Residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled in droves, in an extremely miserable state.

### Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hepburn, Arrives in Shanghai, Soon to Cruise the Waters off Northern China, U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines to Arrive Here Shortly

Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, left Shanghai on November 22nd of last year. He travelled with the former U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gao Qi, aboard the flagship Augusta to the Philippines. After staying on the Philippine Islands for a full four months, he arrived in Xiamen on the 17th aboard the private yacht Isabel. Now that his business in Xiamen is concluded, he sailed and arrived in Shanghai at 5:45 PM the day before yesterday (the 18th).

Cruise of Northern China Still to Be Held

Foreign reports suggest that the annual cruise of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in Chinese waters may not be held this year. This rumor is enough to create the impression that the United States tacitly acknowledges that North China has become a fait accompli. According to U.S. fleet practice, the fleet usually stays in the Philippines during the winter and moves to cruise the waters off North China in late spring and early summer. At the end of May, it changes its anchorage to Yantai and Qingdao. Evidence such as the arrival of the large U.S. seaplane tender Wright in Shanghai, and news that the Augusta and Marblehead will arrive in Shanghai before the end of the month, suggests that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet will still follow its usual practice of cruising in Chinese waters this year. According to foreign reports, Admiral Hepburn rented a house in Qingdao long ago for summering. The various rumors spread because of Admiral Hepburn's arrival are thus self-defeating.

Meeting with Sayre Before Heading North

The admiral's wife and three daughters returned to Shanghai from the Philippines a week earlier aboard the President Coolidge of the American President Lines. They were hosted by Rear Admiral Glassford and are currently staying at the 13-story building on Xipushi Road. It is reported that Admiral Hepburn's Shanghai apartment is also temporarily located there. Yesterday, Admiral Hepburn met with Rear Admiral Glassford and U.S. naval authorities. In addition to handling official business, he will also visit various waters off North China for a routine inspection. However, there is no definite news as to when he will head north. It is likely to be after meeting with U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre. According to foreign reports, Sayre will arrive in Shanghai on the Astoria, but according to reporters' inquiries, he will instead travel aboard the flagship Augusta and then sail to Kobe to transfer to Tokyo to meet with Ambassador Grew. Shanghai, which has been quiet for a long time, has become a focus of diplomatic attention again due to the arrival of Hepburn and Sayre during this time of urgent European turmoil.

### Abe "Mission" to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Afternoon, A Group of Seventy People Including Government and Civilian Representatives, Attempting to Sign a "Unilateral Treaty" after Visiting Nanjing

Japan's invasion of China has exhausted its resources and it is attempting to create a unilateral peace. It has selected former Prime Minister General Abe Nobuyuki as its plenipotentiary ambassador to the Nanjing "regime." His "mission" is as large as seventy people. They are coming to China from Japan aboard the Kashima Maru and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. Details are as follows:

Arriving in Shanghai Tomorrow Afternoon

Since the Japanese army launched its war of aggression against China with the "July 7th Incident" and the "August 13th Incident," it has met with heroic resistance everywhere and has become bogged down. It has established a new "regime" and dispatched General Abe Nobuyuki to lead his "mission," which left Tokyo on the 15th and sailed from Kobe on the 18th aboard the Kashima Maru, attempting to sign a "treaty" and create a unilateral peace. It is expected that Abe and his party will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. Japanese military authorities and secret agents stationed in Shanghai are actively engaged in arrangements and security preparations.

Large Number of Entourage

After Abe and others arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, they will rest briefly before heading to Nanjing. The members of this "mission" include General Abe Nobuyuki, High and Matsumoto, two councillors, mission advisors Lieutenant General Sato and Major General Takagi, and representatives from the House of Peers Murahei Yoritoshi, representative of the House of Representatives Koyama Matsuju, representatives of financial circles Hatta Gadon and Shoji Otsukichi, representatives of pro-China groups Nagata Hideketsuro and Ichinomiya Fusajiro, and representatives of the press Tanaka Kichi, Furuno Bokunosuke, and Kikuchi, totaling as many as seventy people. This is truly an unprecedentedly large number. This especially demonstrates Japan's last resort on its road to invading China.

### French Concession Equalization Committee Strictly Prohibits Price Gouging, If Merchants Are Not Satisfied with Reasonable Profits, Overcharging and Engaging in Trickery Will Be Investigated by the Police

The Price Equalization Committee for Daily Necessities in the French Concession recently resolved to publish the prices of daily necessities so that residents can have a reference. Regarding the price limits of goods, no regulations will be added for the time being, but if selling merchants are not satisfied with reasonable profits, price limits will be set. In the future, if residents encounter merchants who excessively raise prices or engage in trickery or fraud in the quality of goods, weights, and measures, they can report to the nearby police station for investigation. The following police stations all accept residents' complaints: (1) Central Police Station at 22 Xuehuali Road, (2) Foch Police Station at 1307 Avenue Joffre, (3) Petain Police Station at 648 Route Frelupt, (4) Joffre Police Station at 235 Avenue Joffre, (5) Malais Police Station at 151 Avenue Edward VII, (6) East District Police Station at 130 The Bund, French Concession. All complaints must be based on facts and reported in writing, and must be signed. Unsigned complaints will not be accepted.

Inspecting Food

The French Concession recently inspected food selling shops. A total of eighty-one butcher shops were admonished or fined for violations, most of which involved cases of counterfeiting meat product grade stamps. Also, two bakeries were fined because the actual weight of the bread did not match the stated weight (a difference of up to one and a half ounces). Inspections were also conducted at various milk farms. Of the sixty-four samples taken, three were found to be adulterated with water. Two milk farms have had their business licenses requested to be revoked by the Health Department to the French Consul General.

Pay Attention to Cleanliness

Typhus and relapsing fever are both spread by parasites such as lice. Recently, with the warming weather, typhus has been gradually increasing. Residents should bathe and change clothes frequently to prevent lice from hiding and spreading disease. If approaching someone suspected of having lice, it is best to carry a cloth bag containing fragrances such as mint, bergamot, oil, and naphtha, so that the lice will not dare to approach.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Sends Letter of Thanks to Justice Mossop

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently sent a letter to Justice Mossop of the British Supreme Court for China, stating briefly that Mr. Walter, when he was invited to be the chairman of the annual meeting of taxpayers held yesterday, made the conference agenda proceed smoothly, his kindness is appreciated.

### Desperate Appeal

My son ran away on the afternoon of the fifth, causing his old father to lose his appetite and sleep. Our family is anxious and focused, and the money is a small matter, but the affection of flesh and blood is long. He has now been told by his brother to return quickly if he is unaware of the danger, as this will endanger the lives of his parents. A young man's temporary mistakes are forgivable, but he must not do things that he will regret for the rest of his life. I hope he sees the report and returns quickly.

### Japan Arbitrarily Detains Export Goods, Undermining Customs Authority, Now Plans to Intensify with a "License" System

Starting on the first of this month, the Japanese side suddenly dispatched warships to detain flour, ramie, iron, and other goods exported by local export merchants. Even tin foil was among the items detained. This was reported earlier. The detained goods have been returned successively within this week. However, when returning the goods, a "tip" of seventy yuan was required for every thousand yuan of detained goods, causing export merchants not only to fail to make a profit, but also to suffer heavy losses. The Japanese side's "license" system for exported goods is reportedly being studied. If this system is implemented, it can be determined that it will undermine customs authority. Therefore, all parties in the city are now closely monitoring the situation.

### Fair-Priced Rice Cannot Be Stopped, All Sectors Share the Burden, The Problem of Rice for Common People Remains Serious, Fourth Phase Decided to Continue, Hoping for Joint Support

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various guilds and associations yesterday regarding the solicitation of donations for fair-priced rice, stating, "Greetings. We recently received a letter from Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Fair-Priced Rice Committee, stating that the committee has been established for three months, during which three phases of fair-priced rice have been implemented, with donations totaling over 700,000 yuan, and losses also totaling over 700,000 yuan. As the three phases have ended, a small conclusion has been reached. However, at a meeting of the entire committee on the 6th of this month, it was unanimously agreed that the supply of rice is subject to internal control and external exchange rate difficulties, and the price decrease is hopeless. If the fair-priced rice is stopped abruptly, the market will be even more disturbed and famine will be imminent. Therefore, it was decided to continue the operation and increase the number of standing committee members to gather ideas. Although this matter is a small burden for the committee, it is different from moving mountains and crossing the sea. Moreover, it concerns the lives of thousands of poor people.

How Can We Stand Idly By? Therefore, we do not hesitate to bear the burden on one shoulder. Subsequently, at the Standing Committee meeting on the 13th, a plan was made to continue the effort and raise 1 million yuan in donations for fair-priced rice. Over 300,000 yuan was immediately pledged by the standing committee members and representatives of various industries, showing a spirit of harmony and mutual assistance, which is gratifying. However, one tree alone cannot support the forest, and it is inferior to the support of the masses. We believe that your association is the hub of the overall plan and the leader of the community. We dare to hope that you will send letters to various guilds and associations to assist in donations, work hard to contribute, and make this act of charity a success. We are eagerly awaiting your response." Since Shanghai has been affected by the current situation, the price of rice has broken all previous records, making it difficult for common people to make a living. The committee's fair-priced rice program has been in operation for three months. Although

Millions Have Been Lost

the common people have benefited greatly. The problem of rice for common people remains serious. If fair-priced rice is not continued, thousands of poor people will have no way to cook. All losses from fair-priced rice, at this time, we hope that our business community and all sectors will share the burden, and that your association will persuade your colleagues to donate according to their ability, so as to maintain this act of charity. We are eagerly awaiting your response. Please send the donations directly to the Shanghai branches of the Zhongnan, Jincheng, and San banks, and to the Tongrun Money Exchange for collection.

### Coal Briquettes Continue to Be Sold at Fair Prices, Sales Period from the 26th, Limited to Ten Days, Retail Fair-Priced Coal Briquettes Exclusively for Poor Households

The Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association held its 29th joint meeting of representatives at its meeting room on Tianjin Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the matter of selling coal briquettes at fair prices. More than 20 representatives from Yitaixing, Nanyang, Jinghua, Guohua, and other factories participated in the discussion, chaired by Zhang Shi. (1) Regarding the proposal to temporarily suspend the third phase of fair-priced coal briquettes, which will expire on the 20th of this month, it was resolved that the fair-priced sales would be temporarily suspended on that day. (2) Regarding the proposal to continue the fourth phase of fair-priced coal briquettes, it was resolved that the fair-priced sales would continue for ten days from the 26th of this month to May 5th. Each person is limited to purchasing 5.5 jin of coal briquettes for 3 jiao in national currency each time. The fair-priced sales locations will be arranged by the 23rd of this month. As for other procedures, they are the same as in the previous phase.

In addition to the fair-priced sales, fair-priced coal briquettes were reported that Yitaixing, Jinghua, and Yuanfeng coal briquette factories decided to set up six fair-priced coal briquette sales points in poor areas on their own initiative, starting from the 21st of this month. Sales will begin at 10:00 AM every day and end at 12:00 PM. Each person is limited to purchasing one lot, with prices of 3 yuan, with 15 jin, 2 yuan for 30 jin, and 3 yuan for 45 jin (market jin). Customers must pick up the coal themselves and delivery is not provided. The addresses have been determined as follows: (1) Guanghua Yiji Coal Briquette Store, 390 Route Lafayette, (2) Xinchang Yiji Coal Briquette Store, 393 Rue Amiral Courbet, (3) Yitaixing Retail Department, 380 Rue Cardinal Mercier, (The coal briquettes for the above three locations are all supplied by Yitaixing) (4) Jinghua Coal Briquette Warehouse, 358 Wenlin Road, (5) Jinghua Retail Department, 565 Dapuqiao, (The above two locations are supplied by Jinghua Factory itself), (6) Yuanfeng Coal Briquette Factory Retail Department, 1 Lane 1, 356 Rue Culty, (Supplied by Yuanfeng Factory itself).

Hot Water Coal Starting Sale on the 22nd

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association recently decided to supply members of the Hot Water Industry Association with fair-priced coal briquettes. The association, recognizing that coal is an indispensable item for each hot water shop every day, and that each hot water shop is a small business that has been affected by the rising coal prices, with a small number have been forced to stop selling water, which has a close relationship with all aspects of society, fire accidents will inevitably occur. Therefore, it has resolutely decided to conduct the fourth phase of fair-priced coal briquette sales to supply the hot water shops for burning. The sale will begin on the 22nd, with a fair price of 50 yuan in national currency per ton. Each household is limited to purchasing one ton. Until the 26th, every day from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, the owners of each hot water shop can bring one each of their shop owner's name and brand seal to the industry market at 405 Tianjin Road to receive a "Coal Application Certificate," but the application is only valid until the quota is sold out.

### Yesterday Afternoon on North Zhejiang Road, Police Confronted Robbers, Two Robbers Shot and Captured on the Spot, Stray Bullets Killed and Wounded Passersby, Three Robbery Cases Occurred Within Two Hours

In the area of North Henan Road, Haining Road, in the Public Concession, three major robbery cases suddenly occurred between yesterday morning and 12:00 PM. The robbers resisted arrest, resulting in a major confrontation. Stray bullets flew everywhere, killing one passerby. Details of each incident are as follows:

Lu Liankui's Home Suddenly Looted

No. 5 Tailai Lane, Haining Road, is the residence of the concubine of the late Chinese Inspector of the Public Concession Police Department, Lu Liankui. The house is three stories high and she resides in the left wing room on the ground floor. At 10:45 AM yesterday, four robbers suddenly broke into her home through the back door. They immediately pulled out guns and first confined the guests in the house, regardless of gender or status, in the right wing room downstairs, assigning one robber to guard the door and prevent them from making any noise. The remaining robbers then first broke into Lu's room, rummaging through boxes and chests, looting at will. After they had finished looting, they went upstairs and robbed the rooms of the tenants surnamed Qin, Li, and Yan, leaving nothing behind. After about an hour and a half, they took the loot and fled through the back door. The victim cautiously went outside to investigate, but the robbers were nowhere to be found. She then reported to the Huizhou Road Police Station for investigation. The estimated value of the jewelry and cash stolen is over 20,000 yuan. When reporters rushed to the scene to interview, the people inside looked distressed. Lu's room was in disarray, with items scattered on the ground.

Zhou from Wu Chang Ji Hao Suffers

Taiyuan Lane and Tailai Lane on Haining Road face each other. No. 17 in the lane is the residence of the former Shanghai celebrity Wang Xiaolai, with five floors and five basements. It is now rented out to several tenants, including silk firms and Shenzhuang (cotton shop). Among them, Wu Chang Ji Silk Company is located in the middle building. The scale is large, and the goods are piled up. A large number of female workers are employed. Unexpectedly, at 11:45 AM yesterday, Mr. Zhou from a colleague company had just withdrawn 2,500 yuan in French currency from the bank, wrapped in newspaper and tucked under his arm. He hired a rickshaw to the entrance of Taiyuan Lane. As he slowly stepped into the courtyard of No. 17 and walked down the corridor, three people suddenly rushed out from behind, stepped forward quickly, showed their guns, and forbade him from making any noise. They snatched the package of French currency from under his arm and ran away. The victim reported to the police station for investigation. Afterwards, Mr. Zhou told people that after he left the bank, he was afraid of the inconvenience of walking along the way, so he took a streetcar instead. Who knew that he would be discovered by the robbers, followed, and suffer this unfortunate event.

Chen, a Doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Suffers Losses

Chen Yuming, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine specializing in pediatrics from Danyang, in his forties, has been renting a place for years at No. 54 Jingxing Lane, north of the Tianhou Palace Bridge on North Henan Road. At around 11:20 AM yesterday, a strong man in a long black robe suddenly entered the clinic, claiming to seek treatment for a throat ailment from Dr. Chen. The receptionist, Dong Fakang (age 24, from Ningbo), replied that they only treat pediatrics here and that throat ailments are not their specialty. Before he could finish speaking, the strong man pulled out a gun and threatened everyone in the room, forbidding them from making any noise. At this time, four more people walked in from outside the door. Two of them also showed their guns. One robber guarded the main door, and another stood upright next to the staircase. The remaining three robbers then walked into Chen's clinic, first cutting the telephone line and forcing Chen Yuming to

Hand Over Valuables

Since there was nothing of value in the clinic, they only stole about 30 yuan in French currency from the drawer. The robbers, unsatisfied, went upstairs. The door to the Yan family's room in the living room was tightly closed, so they were spared. They then turned into the Chen and Cheng families' rooms in the front and rear wings. After about half an hour, they only stole about 30 yuan in French currency before fleeing downstairs, along with the two robbers guarding the door. At this time, a tea boy named Wang Xihe (age 20, from Danyang) was exceptionally alert. Seeing the robbers fleeing through the back door, he walked out of the front door,

Following Behind Them

After the robbers left the door, they walked out of the north street of Jingxing Lane and headed west on Qipu Road. Wang followed closely. However, one of the five robbers had already gone in another direction. The remaining robbers hired a car at the Tailai Auto Shop across from the Special Court on North Zhejiang Road, claiming to be going somewhere in western Shanghai. The cashier ordered the driver Zhang Fenggang (age 40, from Yangzhou) to drive a business car parked on the side of the road, license plate number 2782. Three robbers sat in the car, and one robber sat in the front, side by side with the driver. At this time, several Chinese police officers from the Special Zone Court diagonally opposite were standing guard at the gate. Wang suddenly

Came up with an idea and went forward to report, saying that the passengers in the car were all robbers. Upon hearing the report, three police officers rushed over, surrounding the car with their guns. One police officer stood in front of the Mingxing Barber Shop across from the Tailai Auto Shop, one police officer hid behind car number 27672, and another police officer stood by the cashier's desk in the auto shop, ordering the driver to stop and telling him to get out of the car and avoid the danger. At that time, the robbers in the car, seeing that their plan had been exposed, all pulled out their guns. One robber in the front of the car threatened the driver, telling him not to get out of the car. The robbers, seeing that the situation was tense, swarmed out. The robbers were the first to open fire to resist arrest, and the police also drew their guns and opened fire.

Bullets Flew Everywhere

For more than ten shots. At this time, a Western police officer named Peter also heard the alarm and rushed to join the battle. Two robbers were shot, wounded, and captured. They were sent to the police hospital. The other two robbers managed to escape without a trace. Two other pedestrians, about fourteen or fifteen years old, one of whom was hit in the head by a stray bullet, causing his brain to spill out. He collapsed next to the counter of the Wang Shunxing Coffin Shop at No. 204 North Zhejiang Road, covered in blood, on the verge of death. He was sent to the police hospital by the police, but died despite treatment. Another pedestrian named Lu Yuanyuan, from Tongzhou, was shot in the right waist.

Seriously Injured and Transported to Baolong Hospital for Treatment. During the confrontation, Western police officer Peter was also grazed in the leg by a bullet. Fortunately, the injury was minor. After being bandaged by the police hospital doctor, he was immediately discharged. Upon hearing the report, the head of the Huizhou Road Police Station was furious that three robbery cases had occurred in quick succession within two hours. He immediately ordered Chinese Detective Shang Wu to lead Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene of the incident to investigate. They saw bullet marks all over the car and found some of the stolen goods and pistols next to the injured robbers, which were taken back for filing and investigation.

### Japanese Soldiers Detain Russian Police Officers at the Iron Gate on Xinqiao Street, French Concession, Caused by Interference in a Chinese Passing Through the Iron Gate, Two Russian and Vietnamese Police Officers Detained for One Hour Before Being Released

Around 2:00 PM yesterday, a Chinese person passed through the iron gate at the intersection of Min Guo Road and Zilaihuo Street East in the French Concession, intending to go to Nanshi. As soon as he exited the iron gate, he violated a police regulation. The Vietnamese police officer stationed at the iron gate stepped forward to reprimand him. The Chinese person was stubborn and refused to comply. The military police on the opposite side saw this and stepped forward to intervene, leading to a fight. A Russian police officer who was standing nearby saw this and rushed to assist the Vietnamese police officer. Unexpectedly, he was seen by the remaining military police, who rushed forward and dragged the two Vietnamese and Russian police officers from the French Police Station into the military police headquarters stationed on the Chinese side of the border, detaining them and preventing them from leaving. The French Concession patrol officer at the scene then telephoned the French Police Station and dispatched a Western detective proficient in Japanese to negotiate with their superiors. At that time, a guard of honor armed to bid farewell to the departing French army commander was passing by and resting, causing hundreds of people to stop and watch along the road, spreading rumors and creating a tense situation. After an hour of negotiation, the two detained Vietnamese and Russian police officers were released and regained their freedom. The dispute ended and the onlookers dispersed.

### Parricide and Incest Case: Request for Re-Examination; Dissatisfaction Expressed with Initial Examination; Case to be Heard for a Second Time

The sensational parricide and incest case of the unfilial son Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang, after being sentenced to death by the Special First Court, and their mother Zhou Jing sentenced to two years and six months for assisting in the destruction of the body, Zhou and others were dissatisfied with the verdict. They retained three lawyers, Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, and Yang Sicheng, while Zhou Jing retained lawyers Jiang Pingfan and Jiang Baoli, to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. After one hearing, the appellants expressed dissatisfaction with the forensic examination regarding whether Zhou Qinji and others had hereditary mental illness. They requested a re-examination, and the application was submitted to the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday morning by the appellants' representative lawyers. The application stated that regarding the question of whether Zhou Qinji and others suffered from mental derangement or mental weakness, the defense learned after reviewing the files that the court had already appointed Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan to jointly conduct an examination. The court had informed Wei the main points of the examination, namely whether the appellants Zhou Qinji and others suffered from the two types of mental illness, mental derangement and mental weakness. The content of the examination report was divided into four sections, and the main points of the examination were not separately stated. Therefore, the report was vague and unclear as to which was mental derangement and which was mental weakness.

### Examination Report

The first section stated that the defendants (referring to the appellants) were examined in the detention room of the police station. When questioned about the case, their answers were consistent with their confessions. Their speech and thoughts were clear and orderly. According to the detectives, the defendants behaved normally in the detention room, with normal diet and living habits, and no abnormal or uneasy behavior was observed. Regarding the defendants' academic history, a letter from Nanyang Middle School stated that the defendants studied at the school for five years, from September of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) to June of the 27th year of the Republic (1938). Their character was generally acceptable, and their academic performance was barely passing, but their physical condition was not very healthy. The second section stated that their physical examination showed poor nutrition, medium development, no abnormal physical appearance, and no significant abnormalities in various neurological responses. However, Zhou Qinji's knee-jerk reaction was slightly more pronounced than his brother's, but without any pathological signs. The third section stated that, based on the examination results, the defendants' mental state showed no changes. They were fully oriented during questioning, with good memory and comprehension, and no mental confusion or disorientation. The examining location and method were inappropriate and essential symptoms of mental illness were not checked. Therefore the conclusion reached was somewhat of mental weakness but could not be regarded as complete.

### Reasons for Dissatisfaction

(1) "Inappropriate examination location": The examination of the appellants took place in the detention room, where they were under special surveillance by detectives, which is equivalent to a prison where freedom is deprived. The examination of mental illness is a difficult subject in medicine, and without a suitable location, the patient's temperament and symptoms cannot be discovered, and it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, Article 190, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law stipulates that "if necessary for the examination of the defendant's mental or physical condition, the defendant may be sent to a hospital or other suitable location for a predetermined period," which indicates that the examination of mental condition is predicated on allowing the defendant to express their nature. A detention room adopts a deterrent approach, and the mental abnormalities of criminals are concealed or masked by deterrence. How can mental abnormalities be discovered in such a situation? It is like asking a mouse to jump in front of a cat or a tiger to fight in front of a lion. It is not that the mouse does not want to jump, but it is afraid of the cat's power. It is not that the tiger cannot fight, but it is afraid of the lion's power. Therefore, the defense believes that using the detention room as the location for the mental examination of the appellants will inevitably lead to errors in the examination results. (2) "Inappropriate examination method": Criminology also states that it is often difficult to observe the temperament of criminals because humans have a natural tendency to keep their emotions secret, especially regarding their shortcomings, weaknesses, or misdeeds. Whether they are first-time offenders or repeat offenders, they try their best to avoid revealing them. Therefore, the examination of a criminal's mental state requires experts with in-depth knowledge of psychology and pathology to accurately determine whether they have lost or weakened their mental capacity. (3) "Essential symptoms of mental disorder were not examined completely." (Omitted) (4) Examiner Zhang Yan did not submit a report. The examination process and its results should be reported by the examiners orally or in writing. When there are multiple examiners, they may submit a joint report, but if they have different opinions, they should submit separate reports. In this case, there were two examiners, but only forensic doctor Wei submitted a report. Zhang Yan did not co-sign the report or submit a separate report, which violates Article 93 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Based on the above, it is requested that the court carefully examine the matter and promptly appoint mental health experts to conduct another examination in accordance with the law to ensure thoroughness. Doctors Yuan Junchang and Han Fen in this city are highly knowledgeable in neurology and are willing to participate in the examination free of charge. If they are asked to conduct a joint examination, it will undoubtedly yield unexpected gains regarding the causes and effects of the criminal behavior. It is reported that this case will soon be heard for a second time by Judge Nie Chongyi of the Second Branch of the High Court in a collegial panel.

### Elderly Man, Burdened by Poverty and Illness, Plunges to His Death in the Early Morning; Jumped from the Fifth Floor, Skull Fractured; Suicide Note Addressed to Yu Zuoting and Others

Yesterday morning at around 5:00 AM, a tragic incident occurred at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Yu Qiaqing Road, where an elderly man plunged to his death. The deceased was Yu Shunqing, a cousin of the former chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yu Zuoting. Yu, over sixty years old, was from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. He came to Shanghai after the August 13th Incident. Initially, he lived at the Qianji Hotel. Due to financial difficulties, his cousin Yu Zuoting introduced him to the dormitory on the fifth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association. The reason for the suicide was attributed to poverty and illness.

### Summary of Chairman Fan Keling's Speech at the Annual Meeting (Part 3)

This Year's Budget

The 1940 budget has been distributed to everyone for review, and detailed explanations are attached. Therefore, I only need to highlight a few key points. The estimated expenditure for this year, including projects carried over from the previous year, totals approximately 47,476,970 yuan. On the revenue side, based on the current tax rates, it is estimated to be 35,142,150 yuan, resulting in a shortfall of 12,334,820 yuan. After repeated consideration, the General Bureau decided to uniformly increase the surcharges by 50% on all current tax rates, starting from July 1st of this year. At the same time, the surcharges on various license fees will be increased from 10% to 50% to supplement the revenue. Even with the approval of this surcharge, the estimated deficit for this year remains substantial.

In the past, during each discussion of tax increases, the bureau was questioned about the use of the huge sum of 81 million taels of silver from the sale of the electricity department, as if the money had been completely wasted. It was suggested that the bureau should have considered the financial situation earlier. When the bureau sold the electricity department, its debt amounted to approximately 46 million taels of silver and 75 million pounds in foreign currency. The sale price of 81 million taels was to be paid in five years. The use of this income was stipulated to be primarily for repaying old debts, with any remaining funds allocated to finance important facilities. The loan of 75 million pounds was originally scheduled to be repaid in 1950, but due to the proceeds from the sale of the electricity department, it was repaid in 1930. Converting it to taels of silver, the amount paid was approximately 6.5 million taels. If this loan had been extended to today, it would be worth approximately 45 million yuan at the current exchange rate, plus annual interest, etc., totaling approximately 3.5 million yuan.

As of the end of 1933, approximately 47.5 million taels of the proceeds from the sale had been used to repay debts, and approximately 29.5 million taels had been used for temporary expenses such as land acquisition, construction, and road building. The remaining amount of approximately 4 million taels was transferred to the "Debt Temporary Account" as a debt repayment fund. Subsequently, the bureau's financial situation deteriorated, and it had to change the original debt repayment and fund deposit plans. As a result, approximately 8 million yuan from the "Debt Temporary Account" was transferred to cover the budget shortfall for current expenses, and the remaining 4 million yuan was transferred to the general reserve fund. Since 1932, the general reserve fund has been frequently used to supplement the budget for current expenses. As of last year, approximately 11 million yuan had been withdrawn from the reserve fund, leaving very little available for use. As a result of selling the electricity department ten years ago, the bureau was able to initiate reforms and expansions in public security and education. Over the past ten years, the benefits to taxpayers have been significant. The facts are clear and undeniable.

### Fake Police Colluding with Gangsters, Extorting "Protection Fees"; Goods Transported from Nanshi into the Concession Threatened and Extorted

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that trucks transporting goods from Nanshi into the French Concession were frequently subjected to extortion of "protection fees" by gangsters before being allowed to pass. These gangsters would surround trucks carrying goods from Nanshi and force the drivers and coolies into nearby teahouses to start negotiations and extort "protection fees," sometimes as high as 70% of the value of the goods. They would threaten to damage the goods. It is rumored that "Avenue" police in Nanshi are colluding with these gangsters, with the "Avenue" police also entering the teahouses to participate in the negotiations and share the spoils. Those who purchase goods in Nanshi and transport them out are required to obtain permits from the Japanese authorities, but the gangsters avoid the eyes and ears of the Japanese when extorting, disregarding the permits. To avoid losing their goods, transporters generally pay a certain amount to ensure safe passage.

A Miserable Late Life

When Yu was young, he engaged in the flour business and traveled to various provinces in the interior to investigate coal and oil industries. After the August 13th Incident, he came to Shanghai alone and resided at the Qianji Hotel to organize the China Petroleum Industry Promotion Society, soliciting support from various parties. Shanghai gentry and businessmen such as Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, and Xu Jiqing were listed as founders or sponsors. However, funds eventually ran out, and with the rising cost of living in Shanghai, it became difficult to continue. Yu Zuoting introduced him to reside in the dormitory of the Native Place Association to reduce expenses, with Zuoting paying the accommodation fees. His old illness often recurred. Lin Kanghou also sympathized with his plight in his later years and arranged for doctors and medicine for him for two months. Other necessities were provided by friends from time to time.

Suicide by Jumping

Although Yu took medicine and injections intermittently, his old age and frailty made it difficult to regain his health. According to the doctor, his heart and blood were exhausted. In recent months, he had been bedridden, and his illness worsened. He often lamented his fate. The day before his death, a friend sent someone to bring him money, but he sighed and said, "I am about to die, what is the use of money?" and asked the person to take it back, suggesting that he already had suicidal thoughts. In the early morning of the 19th, he took advantage of the lack of vigilance and tragically jumped to his death. It was not until dawn that passersby discovered him and reported it to the nearby Lao Zha Police Station for investigation. An ambulance was summoned to take him to the Longhua Hospital for emergency treatment, but he died from a fractured skull due to the fall from the fifth floor, and the treatment was unsuccessful. He was then transferred for a post-mortem examination. In Shanghai, in addition to his cousin Yu Zuoting, he also had a younger cousin Yu Songqing. The deceased's suicide note was addressed to Yu Zuoting, Lin Kanghou, and others, and was taken to the police station for investigation.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Sir, The news column in today's newspaper contains a report about the dispute between Wang Fuji Nail Factory and our company, which contains many inaccuracies. Commission agents do not have legal authority. Our company's sales contracts are always signed by myself, and I am responsible for any disputes that arise. The Wang Fuji Nail Factory order could not be shipped due to the outbreak of the European war, and there is documentary evidence to prove this. It is not an empty accusation. Liu Tonggui was a salesman in our company and left for personal reasons. He has never been a commission agent. His testimony is nothing but malicious revenge. Please check and correct this. Sincerely, Luo Ming, Legal Representative of the Belgian-Chinese Hualong Foreign Firm, April 19, 1940.

### Finance: Swap Monthly Interest Rate Exceeds Four Points; Foreign Exchange Arbitrage Transactions Are Booming

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: The HSBC price remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates was relatively dull. Firstly, speculation was not enthusiastic. Secondly, there were no new stimuli in the environment. Operators took very stable steps. Therefore, there were mainly arbitrage transactions. Initially, the exchange rate rebounded slightly. After opening, the US exchange rate was 6 yuan, and the British exchange rate remained unchanged. Subsequently, as foreign firms expressed a desire to sell, the market remained relaxed. Later, Chinese and foreign firms engaged in opening-milling transactions. At noon, speculators suddenly became interested in buying, and the price slowly softened. The afternoon market was sluggish, with little attention. The forward US exchange rate was also soft. The spot price and the May contract differed by as much as 2.5 to 2.8125 jiao. Those who held spot cash became active and offered forward discounts, reaching more than four points per month (calculated for 40 days).

American Banks Continuously Supplied

Initially, the London rate fell 0.0625, but it quickly recovered. The New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London raw silver remained stable. The exchange rates of British against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. US against British rose 1.875 points, against Shanghai rose 5 points, and against French rose 75 points. The central price remained unchanged. Banks opened with a spot price of British at 4 shillings and 125 points, and US at 6 yuan, which was the same as the closing price yesterday. This caused the exchange rate to recover. After opening, foreign and American banks were eager to sell, so the market remained flat, even though foreign firms were settling with Dutch and other foreign firms. The HSBC price remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 0.50. Thereafter, Chinese firms engaged in slight arbitrage transactions. It was estimated that American banks sold spot US to speculators at 6 yuan, and foreign firms entered into May US contracts with Chinese firms at 5.71875 and 75 jiao. At noon, speculators bought back April US from foreign firms at a price of 5.875 yuan, and May at 5.6875 yuan. The midday situation continued to recover to a flat level. As a result, British closed at 4 shillings and 125 points, and US closed at 6 yuan, similar to the opening price.

May US Exchange Rate Particularly Tight

The afternoon initially opened with a particularly stable situation. Very few opening transactions were done. It was only reported that speculators bought back the May US exchange rate at 5.65625 yuan. Besides this, foreign firms were the only ones trading amongst themselves, with the May US exchange rate also at 5.65625 yuan. However, the May US exchange rate was slightly tight at times. Until the evening close, there were no changes. As a result, the spot price of British was 4 shillings and 125 points, and US was 6 yuan. The April price of British was 4 shillings 046875 points, and US was 5.875 yuan. The May price of British was 3 shillings 890625 points, and US was 5.625 yuan.

"United Notes" unofficial market was up 0.75 jiao to 103 yuan.

### Gold Market Trends Show Instability, But Fluctuations Remain Small

Yesterday, the spot raw gold market was unstable, with fluctuating prices and a narrow trading range. This was due to the weakening exchange rate and an unfavorable environment for bullish sentiment, leading to potential price suppression. However, market sentiment remained buoyant, and buying interest could easily emerge, driving prices up. Initially, the exchange rate showed slight fluctuations, and operators adopted a wait-and-see approach, causing the opening price to drop by $27 to $5,800. Although it later rose by over $20, banks suddenly rushed to sell, and despite some absorption, the market still felt oversupplied, causing the price to fall below the $5,800 level, reaching a low of $5,775 for the day. Subsequently, with purchases from gold firms and securities houses, the price recovered above $5,800 by noon. In the afternoon, the exchange rate also stabilized, improving market sentiment. The opening price jumped to $5,830, but briefly fell by over $10. Ultimately, with continued aggressive buying from securities houses, the price rose to $5,840. However, a certain securities house then sold off, and money changers also sold off a significant amount, causing the price to fall to $5,805. The closing price was $5,806, down $21 from the previous day. Trading volume was light, estimated at over 3,000 taels. Gold jewelry shops quoted a $5 decrease. Customs gold and other types remained unchanged.

Raw Gold Falls by $21

From the morning, the exchange rate was high for each bar (ten taels), and market sentiment was slightly weak. The opening price dropped $27 as money changers sold gold to gold firms at $5,800. Subsequently, with a surge in buyers, money changers, banks, and others rushed to buy, while sellers became scarce, causing the price to rebound by $25. Banks sold 50 taels to securities houses at $5,825. Thereafter, a certain bank suddenly sold aggressively, and securities houses and money changers also switched from buying to selling, resulting in an immediate feeling of ample supply. Before long, the price broke through the $5,800 level. At this point, even floating long positions rushed to close, further increasing the sense of oversupply, and the price fell by another $20. Banks traded 30 taels among themselves, declining to $5,777. At that time, a certain gold firm took advantage of the low price to buy, immediately rebounding by $13. Gold firms sold 50 taels to banks at $5,790. However, with banks selling again, the price weakened, and banks sold 20 taels to money changers, falling to $5,775. Near the close, buying interest from gold firms re-emerged, coupled with aggressive absorption from a certain securities house, and floating long positions were completely liquidated. The price then soared out of the $5,800 level. Gold firms bought 10 taels from money changers at $5,810 as the closing price for the noon session. When the afternoon session opened, sentiment was strong, and the opening price jumped $20. Banks sold 10 taels to money changers at $5,830. Subsequently, a certain securities house came to sell high, causing a small retreat of $12. Securities houses sold 20 taels to banks at $5,818. However, securities houses then aggressively bought, and gold firms took the opportunity to raise prices, rebounding by $22. Banks sold 30 taels to money changers at $5,840. Afterwards, money changers and securities houses suddenly switched from buying to selling, gradually falling by $35. Banks sold 10 taels to money changers at $5,805. Then, gold firms did counter-trading of 10 taels at $5,806 as the closing price for the evening session. As a result, the price fell by $21 compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of $65 for the entire day. The selling price of spot gold from cash firms was several dollars higher than raw gold, while the purchase price was $20 lower. The current bid price for gold was over $50 lower than the listed price, with little active trading.

Jewelry Gold Down $5

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael from the major goldsmiths initially remained at $590. But at 9:45 AM, it decreased $5. After that there was no change. Ultimately, the major goldsmiths revised the price to $585. The price of the new goldsmiths was the same as the above price. The purchase price was about $15 lower.

### Foreign Currency Demand Greatly Reduced

Yesterday, foreign currency weakened again, and trading volume decreased significantly. The key issue was the rise in foreign stocks, leading many people to sell foreign exchange and transfer funds into foreign stocks. The market saw a slight weakening of British and American gold pounds, while the US dollar exchange rate fluctuated, hovering between $16.61 and $16.55. The lowest price in the evening session was down $0.06 from the previous day. The French franc was weak. Hong Kong dollar supply and demand were relatively balanced. The Philippine peso was sluggish. However, there was still demand for British gold notes, and the market price rose. Japanese banknotes remained weak, with the former falling to $1.305 and the latter sharply declining to $1.035. The rest remained stable.

### New Aluminum Fractional Currency – Second Batch Issued Yesterday –

After the first batch of $280,000 in newly issued aluminum fractional currency was released, it saw little circulation in the market due to high collection demand. The second batch was issued yesterday, restricted to use by banks and money-related businesses. On the Chinese banks’ side, the Banks Association has entrusted the Bank Preparation Committee to distribute the currency at their discretion. The preparation committee has determined the amounts that each bank can receive, and it has sent letters to the banks notifying them of their allocations. Each bank can receive either 10,000 coins each of one-cent and one-fractional-cent coins, or 20,000 coins total. The association has also requested that the banks distribute the aluminum fractional currency to shops and households as much as possible to stimulate circulation. Going forward, each bank can receive one batch per week. It’s said the weight of each bag of one-fractional-cent coins, containing 10,000 coins (i.e., $100), is approximately 14 and 56/100 pounds.

### Securities, Wheelock Shares Up to $227

The securities unofficial market showed a trend of consolidation yesterday, and the market was sluggish. Bullish players were reluctant to act due to tight credit, while bearish players were unwilling to cover their positions due to the favorable environment. Large institutional investors had yet to enter the market, so the market was in a state of stagnation due to mutual restraint. Trading was light. Both buyers and sellers were very inactive yesterday. Only Hong Kong Land saw some buying in the morning, and No. 38 saw some selling. The rest of the trading was mainly done by retail investors. In the afternoon, No. 38 continued to sell, and No. 7 and Ewo also sought to sell. No. 8, No. 20, Hutchison, and Allied Brick & Tile saw some covering, but they seemed hesitant. As a result, Class A and Class C maintained their original prices, while the rest fell slightly by $0.05 or $0.10. The total trading volume was estimated at over $400,000. A simplified table is provided below:

Class  Highest  Lowest  Closing  Compared to Previous Day

Class A 59.20 59.35 59.50 Even

Class B 51.15 51.00 51.05 Down 0.05

Class C 49.10 48.95 49.05 Even

Class D 48.75 48.60 48.65 Down 0.05

Class E 50.10 49.90 49.95 Down 0.10

In stock trading, 50 shares of Ningbo and Hebian Jiji Factory were traded at a price of $185 per share.

The public industrial stock market remained very active, with astonishing price fluctuations and extremely large trading volumes. Fortunately, profit-taking helped to curb the rise; otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable. At the close, the selling side ran out of shares, and prices rose sharply, with many stocks hitting record highs. Wheelock led the way, rising by as much as $30 in one day, closing at $227 bid, with no sellers. Jardine Matheson shares were in high demand, and although there was some profit-taking, they still rose by $6, closing at $53.50 bid, $54 offer. Trading volume was over 56,000 shares. Steel shares looked promising, with 33,000 shares traded, closing at $39.50 bid. Other industrial shares were lackluster. Rubber shares opened lively and firm, but trading gradually decreased over time, and public interest almost entirely shifted to industrial shares.

London, 18th (Thursday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt were generally stable. Only the Reorganization Loan Central Bank Notes continued to fall by £1, to £37. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton, Base Price Too High, Many Long Positions in Cotton Yarn Liquidated

The yarn market shifted from high to low, but the situation remained tight due to the lack of spot goods, keeping the base price high. Although Hong Kong buyers were strong, their purchases were not as large as before, and some were adopting a wait-and-see approach due to the already high base price.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning, continuing the enthusiastic momentum from the previous day. 20-count Double Horse spot was offered at $1,440, and mill orders were priced at $1,410, up $18. As prices were high and the exchange rate weakened, those taking profits liquidated positions, and market prices quickly declined. Double Horse spot fell back to $1,395, and mill orders were priced at $1,375. Subsequently, long positions became active again, recovering to $1,400, and mill orders were priced at $1,384. It is estimated that 1,850 bales were traded in the first half of the day, with the price of 20-count Double Horse spot unchanged. Today, 10 bales of yarn were shipped to Siam, 200 bales to Saigon, 1,632 bales to Hong Kong, and 65 bales to Xiamen. The amounts purchased by various traders are listed below: Local firms 1,610, Xiamen 50, Hong Kong 190. Total 1,850.

Afternoon News: 20-count Double Horse spot was priced at $1,400, with buyers, similar to the morning closing price, slightly higher. But the momentum was more moderate, not as strong as the previous day.

### US Freight Rates Will Increase, Indian Cotton Trading Particularly Strong

Indian cotton trading was particularly active, while native cotton business was very slow. Factories had some demand, but most transactions were between traders, so prices were flat. The details of spot cotton transactions are listed below:

Pengjiapu 151.50, Xinsheng Huai 100 bales

Urmula 237.00, Xinsheng Jin 300 bales

Pingguoer 201.00, Trader Jin 100 bales

Oomra 234.00, Also 100 bales

Mitterling 295.00, Also 200 bales

Pingguoer 14.50, Also 196.00, Also 600 bales

Pengjiapu 244.00, Also 200 bales

Mitterling 200.00, Also 300 bales

Dazhongji 144.00, Also 230 bales

Mitterling 291.50, Also 200 bales

Xingheng 203.7, Also 100 bales

Xinte 253.00, Shenxin Jin 600 bales

Pingguoer 194.00, De Feng Jin 100 bales

Grass Bag 27.00, Trader Jin 27 bales

Other Foreign Cotton News: The New York cotton market was very quiet yesterday, but quite firm. Later, due to purchases in Wall Street and some short covering, the closing market was firm, with nearby contracts up 1-2 points and distant contracts down 2-3 points compared to the previous day. The Indian market was quiet, and the forecast was largely unchanged.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: The market was quite active, but the majority of transactions were spot trades. This was because the European situation was becoming increasingly serious, and fewer overseas ships were coming to China. Furthermore, yesterday's report stated that US freight rates would increase again, and the supply of long-staple raw cotton from India was very limited. Therefore, 32-count to 42-count raw cotton had to be sourced from the US or Brazil. There were many transactions in long-staple cotton yesterday, with some prices reaching as high as $297-298. However, this was still over $10 cheaper than the foreign firms' quoted prices. The factory delivery prices converted at a US dollar exchange rate of $5.9375 are as follows:

20-count US Mitterling 296.75

20-count US Sub-grade 287.00

32-count Also 313.20

32-count Also Sub-grade 304.80

42-count Also 316.00

41-count Also Sub-grade 306.70

### Food, Southern and Northern Japonica Rice Arriving Continuously

Yesterday, the rice market was tight at first, then weak. The early market was particularly bleak, with prices increasing by $0.50 to $0.70-0.80 across the board. For example, No. 1 Saigon opened at $47.80, and Small Grain opened at $43.80, but there was little actual demand, with most transactions being speculative. As a result, the market mood quickly eased and gradually weakened, falling all the way back to its original level at the close, similar to the previous market.

Only one or two thousand bags of Siam rice were transferred from Dachang Company in Hongkou, and the prices offered were not much different. The source of Lower Village Japonica rice is still strong, but it is subject to control by a certain party. Rice from the north, such as rice from Changshu and Wuxi, is arriving continuously, all exclusively sold and managed by Dachang Company. It is stored in the first and second godowns along the inner river, and transported by truck and barge, both on land and water, into the Shanghai International Settlement. Rice from Nanlu and Paitung is also intercepted by a certain party in Nanshi and a company formed by rice merchants, forcing them to sell it to them at the military rice price (i.e., 21 Japanese yen per picul). The company then resells it to various rice shops. Therefore, rice shops in Nanshi all display white cloths bearing the words "Military Certificate Rice Exchange," because a certain party uses military certificates to buy rice, resells it to the public, and then uses the rice to collect the military certificates circulating in the market.

Due to international pricing, the futures price of foreign rice increased yesterday due to telegrams. The May contract for No. 1 Saigon requires $63. Therefore, firms are trying to hold onto their goods, and Northern traders and large investors have already absorbed a lot of stock and are still trying to add to their positions. Speculation is rampant. The opening price in the morning immediately showed strong buying interest. The opening price for No. 2 Saigon for April and May reached $54.40, up $0.40 from the previous afternoon's closing price of $54. During noon, it was briefly suppressed by floating traders to $54, but at the afternoon close, it was pushed up to $54.45 by large investors. A total of 350 tons of futures were opened and 8,000 bags of spot foreign rice were opened.

### Flour, Local and Wholesale Prices Differ by More Than $1, Stockpilers Buy Back Reclaimed Flour

The flour market continued to be firm, and actual sales on the local market were flat. However, the wholesale price remained high at $15, differing by more than $1 from the local wholesale price. Therefore, stockpilers were considering buying back reclaimed warehouse order flour. The asking price for old car brands was already higher than the factory price, but buyers were only offering $13.77-78, causing sellers to temporarily hold back. It was heard that a few hundred bags of goods in transit were sold later at a price of $13.75. Other mainland Japanese factory flours were mediocre due to sluggish sales. The market environment did not show any special developments. 500 bags of flour will be shipped to Xiamen on the 20th.

Wheat trading remained stagnant yesterday because merchants believed that with the increase in flour prices, the cost of raw materials would also have to increase. However, Chinese factories were trying to suppress prices. Therefore, the prices of small batches of wheat delivered to factories, such as wheat from Changzhou and Wuxi, were often disputed, or the price was set one or two days after delivery. This was not a normal market. As of yesterday, the selling price of Suzhou white wheat had to be above $21, but there were no formal transactions.

### Sugar Market, Foreign Sugar Stable

The sugar market remained firm yesterday. The association's designated prices for spot goods were: 24 raw white sugar, local warehouses, $64.80, unchanged; new goods, external warehouses, $64.65-$64.70, up $0.20; old goods, $64.50-$64.40, up $0.40-0.50; transit goods still $51.40. Taikoo White Sugar, 4 warehouses: B mark $71.60, CW mark $71.30, up $0.10; CX mark $71.00, DY mark $70.70, HX mark $70.50, all up $0.30. H Tong Che Raw sugar $50.50; Dutch raw sugar spot $53.50, transit $44.60, no change. Local soft white and No. 1 rock sugar were unchanged. It was heard that a certain party's X factory offered 15,000 bags of white sugar, with negotiable prices. In the domestic sugar market, a Cantonese trader offered over 200 bags of Dongxiang raw sugar at $43; Jian trader offered Diaozing at $51.50, up $0.50.

### Coal, Wenzhou Green Coal Arrived in Large Quantities in Shanghai, $8.10 Per Dan, Lacking Buyers, Fume White Coal Arrived Over 10,000 Tons

Recently, the price of coal briquettes has increased across the board, but charcoal has gone against the trend. Although it was expensive earlier, the recent influx of charcoal from Haimen and Huangshi, coupled with the end of the peak sales season, has caused the charcoal market to become oversupplied and lack outlets. Yesterday, a large batch of Wenzhou green coal arrived, creating a downward pressure in the market. The offered price was $8 per dan, but there were few buyers. The weakness of the market is evident. However, the fact that charcoal is cheap while coal is expensive is a blessing for the people. (L)

The Chinese-Italian Company's Aengee Lun, carrying over 5,000 tons of white coal dust from Haiphong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. Also, Jardine Matheson's Jeannette Shinner, managed by the foreign shipping department, carrying 7,090 tons of coal from Calcutta, India, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but there was no news of its arrival until yesterday evening. Details were noted in yesterday's newspaper. Today, it is known that the ship berthed yesterday afternoon and is currently unloading. It is estimated that the two ships brought in over 12,000 tons of white coal yesterday. Today, 1,700 cans of kerosene will be shipped to Shantou. (Zu)

### Miscellaneous News, Cement Prices Soar, Sold for $8.50

Recently, there has been an acute shortage of cement in Shanghai. Although there has not been much construction, the demand for cement exceeds supply. The reason is that Blue Circle cement cannot be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities due to the situation in Tianjin, and the arrival of Japanese cement is restricted. The only remaining brands are Taishan from Longtan and Long Brand from Longhua, a large part of which must be supplied to a certain party for military use and to fulfill orders from the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement and the French Concession. This leaves very little available for the market, creating a situation where scarce goods are expensive. Furthermore, dealers are hoarding and raising prices.

According to a letter from the owner, production and stock are already scarce, and prices have also increased, making it difficult to lower prices.

### Old News Newly Copied 67 Years Ago (360)

(From the Shun Ching Tongzhi 12th Year issue of this newspaper)

Sky-Gazing Telescope

Yesterday, a Ningbo man, about thirty years old, resembling a clerk from a foreign firm, was on a high mound in Zhiyuanbang, near the Northwest Fahua Temple in this city, holding a telescope and looking up at the sky. He muttered to himself, "The wonders of the heavenly palace are truly rare in this world!" A moment later, he said, "Lord Zhou Yuji is riding a horse and holding a long spear out of the South Heavenly Gate." The old and young men and women in the village, hearing his words, all flocked to watch. An old man asked the name of the telescope and requested to borrow it for a look. The Ningbo man said, "This is called a sky-gazing telescope, and it can see the sights of the sky. It's not that I'm unwilling to lend it, but this telescope is worth a thousand gold coins. I came to the countryside with my employer to hunt birds, and the boat is parked not far from here. I'm just sneaking away for a moment because my employer is drinking on the boat. If I lend it to you and something unexpected happens, who will bear the responsibility?" The villagers said they would be extra careful and would definitely not make a mistake. The Ningbo man reluctantly agreed. The village elder looked it over and over, but it seemed blurry and unclear. The Ningbo man told him that there was a way to look at it, and if you didn't follow the method, you should look closely as if you didn't see anything. Then he told everyone to look at it carefully according to the method, passing it back and forth, and deliberately let it slip and fall to the ground. The Ningbo man then wailed loudly, grabbing onto the villagers and refusing to let go. Afterwards, he picked it up from the ground and looked at it carefully, and then turned his sorrow into joy, saying, "Fortunately, it's not a big problem. Only a piece of the microscope is broken, and it can still be repaired in Shanghai, but it will cost twenty yuan." After repeated negotiations, they settled on twelve yuan.

The Python Does Not Hurt People

Someone named Huangshan Moujia from Su Yuan entered the mountain to collect firewood. He heard snoring like thunder in the valley. He crouched down to investigate and saw a giant python coiled between the trees. Its head was like a basket, and its eyes were like lightning. Moujia, who was always brave, threw a stone at it, but the python didn't move. Moujia wanted to take a sickle and chop at it, but he lost his footing and fell on the python. He thought he would definitely be harmed, but he was not afraid. However, looking back at the high slope, he could not climb up, so he climbed out by grasping the snake's body and clinging to the vines, and then celebrated his rebirth.

### A Stroll in Wartime Berlin

— Xin Liang

What does wartime Berlin actually look like?

Since we are staying at a very good hotel, of course, we have no way of knowing the situation of the average German. Here, we can still get the best food, like fish and eggs. Even on meatless days, we can eat. In the following, please compare it with the situation in Berlin before the war.

I'm sorry, at breakfast, there is neither grape juice nor orange juice. All there is is just a not-so-good apple.

I asked the waiter in the hotel how they were doing? He told me: the salary is only half of what it was in 1932, but he feels very happy because he can keep this position, but most of his friends can't easily find such a basic position.

Now, let's go out on the street and take a look. We see huge posters. It is said that these things have to be changed every week, mostly depicting Chamberlain as a god of war; the press, however, likes to attack Churchill.

In the large storefront windows along the street, we can still see very beautiful clothes, shirts, leather gloves, etc. You can also buy these things at will. But first you have to present your "shopping record card" for inspection. Every resident living in Berlin has such a card, with a hundred small dots printed on it, valid for one year. Once, a friend of mine bought a new dress, two ties, two shirts, and two pairs of socks in one go, which cost him eighty small dots. In this year, he only has twenty dots left to buy other things. You also have to hand in your old clothes when you buy new clothes.

On the road, you can also often find many people wearing light blue uniforms. They are the air defense forces around Berlin. In Berlin, you don't see many German soldiers wearing green or gray uniforms. There are also people wearing dark blue clothes, most of whom are guards of the Labor Front. The cars driving on the street are all painted gray like warships, and they all now belong to the military.

Now we go to the town of Altona for lunch. Unfortunately, today happens to be a meatless day. There are two such days every week, but in Altona you can still have mashed yam flakes and fruit jam cakes. If you eat at an ordinary German's house, you can only taste one egg a week—and it's very difficult to eat a fish.

Of course, it is quite expensive to eat this meal. The cake, plus a piece of chocolate (you can't eat this anywhere else but in Altona), and a bottle of apple juice wine, cost a total of six marks and fifty尼 [pfennig].

Unfortunately, in the afternoon we cannot visit the largest coffee shop in the area. It is said that it is crowded with people every day - especially middle and lower-class women.

In the evening we had dinner at a private club, where the side dishes were quite good, but the prices were not cheap either.

What does wartime Berlin actually look like? After running around all day, we can roughly know something about it. (Excerpted and translated from The Christian Science Monitor)

Sketches

### Spring Observations

— Niu Zheng

Spring comes stealthily, and soon it will stealthily depart. Just like cherishing my own fading youth, I have recollections and aspirations for this beautiful spring. The golden childhood, in the history of my life, can no longer write beautiful chapters, let it go! Can the ruthless years take away precious youth again?

In the middle of the day, or in the middle of the night, I think of the vast wilderness, a clear stream, the fisherman under the weeping willows, and the kind smile? It is already spring in the garden, I can't help but look far into the depths of the white clouds, asking about the news of the annual red apricots in my hometown, are there still people who cherish the peach petals mixed in the mud? Will the spider's web be full of beams?

Entrusting the spring breeze to convey my words, hometown, I deeply miss you, the former peace and well-being, the old scenery, should have been trampled to the ground! Why does the news brought back pierce the heart of the traveler again?

However, the land permeated with the blood of martyrs should be the most fertile, and the flowers of revolution will bloom so brightly.

I am watching, on the land of my hometown, a glorious flower will soon grow!

### Being God's Son (1)

For most people, these days are dark and difficult days. Life is a difficult thing, and we need to use all our energy, creativity, and patience to do it. It is not easy or simple to be a person in this era. Many people are so busy with their livelihoods that they have little or no time to cultivate their spirituality. The daily struggle for bread and the necessities of life requires great courage and effort from people. In terms of larger social situations, both nationally and internationally, this struggle is even more pronounced. Economic failures have become an unbearable burden for people. In some parts of the world, the necessities of life are trampled on, while in other parts, people starve to death. The estrangement between countries is increasing, mutual suspicion is growing, and everyone is competing in armaments, believing that armaments are the only guarantee of peace, which shows that the world is full of fear and doubt. In terms of personal reorganization and experience, these are dark and difficult days. As for what the future holds, even the most confident prophets dare not predict. Since the beginning of history, today is perhaps the time when great men, strong men, and capable men are most needed. The people we need are those with strong will, not cruel and barbaric, those with compassion, not emotional. In other words, the people we need are the kind trained by Jesus Christ. The main task of religion is to cultivate such a relationship between people and the creator, so that the most beautiful personality can be produced. Jesus of Nazareth dedicated his life to this work and proved it through experimentation. Although the world did many inhuman things to him that would have made him lose trust in people, he still dared to trust people. People ridiculed him, beat him, and put him to death in the most humiliating way, a way only suitable for the most heinous criminals, but he still believed in people, believed in their latent talents. This is because he measured people according to a new standard. One should not look at what a person was like in the past, nor should one look at what they are like now. Instead, one should look at their potential achievements in the future. (To be continued) For detailed research, please send a letter to mailbox number 1227.

### A Tutor's Confession

— Competition

Although I have now obtained a tutor position, it is not something to be envied, because this bowl of rice, worth only a dozen yuan a month, was obtained with great effort—or rather, by using up the words "trouble," "beg," and "thank you." Moreover, now that I have this job, I am beginning to feel that it is not easy to "eat"!

The student I am teaching is a junior high school student who is about to graduate. He—this "master" (because his "grandfather" and "grandmother" have both gone to another world, and the family is supported by their brothers, the servants call their master that way) is used to being pampered. Going to school is just a formality. He is either late or absent from school. Probably because he has been messing around for several years and the school work is too busy at graduation to deal with it easily, this led to my opportunity.

It's been almost a month since I started tutoring! But in these short two hours, I have never seen him not dozing off. Every night, about ten minutes after I arrive, he lazily brings the book (the "palace" has dinner very late!). Before nine o'clock, while I am still pointing at the book and explaining each item, he does not look at the book, but instead "looks around": he starts yawning gradually. His eyes are constantly looking at the clock, as if thinking, "Why is the minute hand moving so slowly?"

The school assigns a lot of homework every day, geometry, algebra, trigonometry... What should this "master," who is "unexplainably" skating and watching movies every day, do? Of course, with his "intelligence," he quickly came up with a "brilliant plan." However, this brilliant plan made me suffer.

He probably thought this way: rather than listening to me teach it once every day and still not being able to solve the problems, it's better to just let me do all the problems for him! After all, he paid for it!

At the beginning—at the beginning of his implementation of this "brilliant plan," he still had me solve the problems on scratch paper and then copied them into his exercise book himself. Later, he probably had "experience" and "improved" it, simply handing the problems to me and asking me to copy them directly into the book. As for himself, he either says "I have something to do and need to take leave" today, or "I have friends inviting me out" tomorrow. He doesn't come to sit for these two "imprisonment" hours for five or six days out of ten!

I used to teach with some interest, but now it's not only bland, but it's simply like going back to junior high school. It's simply like being a junior high school student! Using the term "teaching assistant" from university professors, I can be called this "master's" "reading assistant."

I really feel that this kind of tutor has no possibility of continuing. Alas, I really don't dare to accept this kind of "student"!—I can't work for a person who doesn't want to improve for this small amount of money!

### Time

— Sheng San

Time is the raw material of all things. With it, everything can be solved. Without it, everything is in vain. Time is much more precious than money. If you have time, you can often get money from it. Otherwise, even if you are a millionaire, you cannot spend more money than me or the cat lying next to the stove to buy one more minute.

The most amazing thing is that every morning when you wake up, ah! Your pocket is mysteriously filled with twenty-four hours of your life's universe that have not yet been manufactured. This is yours, this is the most precious wealth you own! Because, you see! No one can steal it from you. It cannot be stolen. It is assigned fairly by heaven to everyone in the world. Everyone gets the same amount, no more and no less than you, and it is supplied continuously.

But the supply of time, although very regular, is also very harsh. You see! Yesterday is gone, and today is also forever gone. There will never be another ordinary yesterday and today. When tomorrow becomes today, it is also when today is forever gone. Do you know? This is the characteristic of time!

Isn't that very sad, depressing, and frustrating? Indeed, if you do not use your twenty-four hours of income in a planned way, then undoubtedly your life will inevitably be buried in confusion. But you should believe that heaven has given us twenty-four hours, which is more than enough. In these continuous twenty-four hours, what can't we do? We can increase our knowledge; encourage our character; lay the foundation for our lives; we can clear away the current obstacles and difficulties: we can create an environment; build a grand future! We don't need more time. The biggest key is whether we can carefully examine the consumption of our daily time.

### Audio Magazine

— Xin Liang

The most pitiful people in the world are those blind people who cannot see with their eyes. They are always living in dark and tragic circumstances, lonely and calm. The kind of depression they feel in their hearts is really so distressing!

In order to enable them to appreciate the wonderful texts and works in various newspapers and magazines, the United States has an "audio" magazine. All the required funds are raised by twenty-seven local libraries across the United States that are dedicated to the welfare of the blind.

According to the person in charge of the magazine, articles from each issue of "Reader's Digest" will be recorded on phonograph records, and then placed in libraries for the general blind to listen to.

This "audio" magazine is scheduled to be published once a month. It is estimated that the number of films required each year will be one hundred to one hundred and twenty. Each side can "speak" for twenty minutes.

### Great Path to the Earth's Core

Now, the fastest mail ship from New York, USA, to the Far East takes at least three weeks, but if a tunnel is built through the center of the earth from New York, USA, directly to the Far East, the round trip would only take three quarters of an hour.

—British New Film First Transported to the Western Front

Britain is now transporting the latest films to the Western Front to entertain the troops, while people in London are eagerly awaiting the return of these films from the Western Front to their own country so that they can feast their eyes. Three mobile film teams have traveled from England to France, where the films will be shown on the front lines for the soldiers to pass the time. Because today's armies are mobilized by vehicles, the projectors and films are carried around by vehicles for screenings. Major British film companies are doing their best to cooperate with the authorities to provide the most exciting films for the British Expeditionary Force stationed in France to pass the time.

Some of the latest films have not yet been shown in London's major cinemas, but have already been transported to France to be shown to the troops. Various films have already been collected and transported across the English Channel to France, and many more films will be transported in succession. Perhaps one day, the main film critics in London will fly to a military base in northwestern France to attend the first public screening of a new film in Europe; or perhaps they will sit among British soldiers 100 feet below the ground on the Maginot Line guarded by the British army to watch the new film "Gone with the Wind."

In addition to films, there are also traveling stage plays performed to entertain the soldiers. This type of stage play was very popular with soldiers during the last war. Groups of volunteer actors have been rehearsing plays and various entertainment programs in London, and some have gone to France to perform for the soldiers. Jack White, who went to France to perform plays to entertain soldiers more than twenty years ago, is planning to lead a theater troupe to the French front again.

### Thus Have I Heard—Chen Manli's Things of the Past After Her Death

— Xiao Tian

Let me tell you a joke, "Once upon a time, there was a man who did all kinds of evil in his life and practiced all kinds of good deeds. After he died, he came to the underworld. The King of Hell opened the merit and demerit book and saw that the merit book was densely written, but the demerit book was completely blank. There had never been such a precedent in the underworld. The King of Hell had to ask him to say where he wanted to be reborn. The man was not flustered and slowly recited a poem. When the King of Hell heard it, he quickly stepped down from his seat and bowed to him, saying, 'If there is such a good place, please come and be the next King of Hell, so that I can also go and enjoy myself.' What did the poem say? It is written below—

Surrounded by thousands of acres of fields around the house, there are pavilions, terraces, flowers and fruit gardens, the warehouse is full of gold and silver, the granary is full of millet, there are carriages and horses on land and boats on water, there are娇妻美妾 in every room, and every child and grandchild is贤能, officials do not care and the people are not disturbed, and the life is longer than彭祖 for a thousand years.

When I finished telling this joke, several friends at the table said in unison, "We feel that it's not as fun as marrying Chen Manli." This was said the day before Manli was murdered. As the ancients said, "I would rather not be granted the title of 万户候, but I wish to be one　Han Jingzhou." Chen Manli's magic power is, after all, greater than Han Jingzhou."

"A person must always be content and abide by the law. Chen Manli can be considered a king in our dance girl world. If she could have been content with her profession, she wouldn't have encountered this kind of unexpected disaster. It's really self-inflicted and she deserves it." This is the first thing I heard after Manli died. The person who said it was undoubtedly also a red star.

Once, I met a friend who often danced with Manli. He told me that he was also at the scene the day Manli was murdered. He could still talk while touching his wound. It can be considered a very tragic death. I asked him what his thoughts were? He said, "When someone dies, just replace them with someone else to dance. Anyway, there will never be an end to dance girls." This is an optimist.

A guest said, "Chen Manli's skin is white and crystal clear, and you can't find any blemishes on her body. Now it's really difficult to find someone like that again." This tone is very much like someone who is close to her, otherwise, how could he have examined her so carefully?" Another guest said, "Beautiful, smart, generous, responsive, and willing to learn ball skills, it's not easy for God to create another person like Chen Manli who is talented, versatile, beautiful, generous, and natural. However, it can be said that her age at death is quite appropriate, otherwise, like Sai Jinhua, leaving people with only an image of an old woman in their minds would be so boring." This is also a part of the reason.

I've been talking about other people's opinions, now it's my turn to say mine. Originally, form is emptiness, and emptiness is form. The Buddhist explanation of the word form is touch, seal, destruction. It can be seen that things that can be touched and sealed will eventually change and be destroyed. When it comes to this point, there is no way to continue, so I have to put my palms together and murmur, good, good.

### News from the Drama World

— Hai

The Yongan Yue Society, organized by colleagues from Yongan Company, will hold Cantonese opera charity performances at the Lanxin Grand Theater from the 22nd to the 27th to help the disaster victims in Zhongshan, Guangdong. The company held a rehearsal of "The Peach Blossom Fan" at Yongan Company the day before yesterday. The reporter interviewed the playwright, Mr. Mai Youyun, who expressed a few thoughts: (1) The writing of Cantonese opera is completely different from Peking opera, but is written in the style of a spoken drama. It tries its best to avoid Cantonese slang. Both the lyrics and the silence are literary, so that this local drama will not be difficult for people to understand. (2) Whether it is in terms of scenery or props, it is made "realistic" to avoid "abstraction." (3) Cantonese opera costumes originally had no restrictions. Actors made them according to their favorite styles, so they often tended to be complicated. This has been gradually improved. Finally, Mr. Mai told me that this performance includes three plays: "Xi Shi," "Pan Jinlian," and "The Peach Blossom Fan." All the tickets have been sold out, raising 50,000 yuan in donations. During the performances, librettos will also be printed and distributed on the stage. They are very enthusiastic about good deeds, which is really admirable.

Dong Zhaobin, the general manager of the Renewal Stage, has already invited the male lead performer Yi Fuying in Beiping. Now Fuying is performing at the Guangming Theater in Dalian starting from the 16th. After five days, he will return to Beiping and then set off for Shanghai.

Wang Xichun has returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the German bao steamer. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to her home in Shanghai reporting that she would be able to land at the New Customs Wharf at 2:00 pm today, asking her family to pick her up.

### New News from the Film World

Chinese cartoonists Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan's plan to produce a full-length cartoon has been adopted by Xinhua Company, and everything has been negotiated. Xinhua has built a large studio that can accommodate 300 people in Dingxiang Garden. It is estimated that the work of 300 people can produce one book per month (a full-length film requires nine or ten books). The cost of a full-length film will be at least 100,000 yuan. The announced "Princess Iron Fan," which is based on the story of "Journey to the West," will be available to the audience as early as next spring.

There are some discrepancies in the rumor that Guohua and Zhou Jianyun are working together. Now, what the two parties are negotiating is the method of renting Guohua's new studio to Zhou's Ghost Tricks, rather than jointly renting the two companies. In the future, administrative economics, etc., will all be independent of each other and will not interfere with each other.

Explanation

According to this encirclement, the black side has lost a lot of initiative, and it is difficult to seek a draw. If the red cannon 7 to 1 changes to red rook 1 to 4, then the black horse 9 advances 8 changes to red rook 4 advances 4. The black rook 8 advances 1 exchanges rooks, then the black side can gain the initiative. Change the horse 9 advances 8, the rook 4 to 2. The black side cannot exchange four horses for rooks. If they exchange, they will lose a piece. The black side must cannon 8 to 9, pawn 7 advances 1, cannon 9 retreats 7 to exchange cannons to maintain the balance.
