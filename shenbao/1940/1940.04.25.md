Editorial

### British-Soviet Negotiations and British-Japanese Negotiations

Among the belligerent countries in Europe today, Britain's situation is perhaps the most complex and delicate. On one hand, it leads the war against Germany, becoming the main target of German attacks and bearing the responsibility of safeguarding security in various parts of Europe. On the other hand, with its territory spread across the globe, it must consider the connection between the home country and its colonies and the preservation of its overseas interests. It is certainly not easy for the British Empire, under the convergence of these heavy obligations and difficulties, to manage everything smoothly and appropriately. Therefore, we cannot overly demand or blame Britain's foreign policy at this time for failing to fully meet our expectations. At the same time, we also hope that the British authorities can be firm and self-respecting, and properly handle their internal and external problems, so that they can consider both the current practical interests and the basic principles proclaimed in this war.

The wars in the Far East and Europe are still continuing, and all rights and wrongs, merits and demerits must be left to future history to judge. However, if we briefly review Britain's foreign measures over the past year, it is not difficult to find that its diplomatic relations with both the Soviet Union and Japan are inevitably marked by major errors and regrets. Regarding the failure of the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union last year, the detailed circumstances have not yet been fully known, and commentators have different views, each with their own observations. However, judging from the evolution of events, the failure of that negotiation was an important fuse for the outbreak of this war and a major blow to Britain and France. After the failure of the negotiations, the Soviet Union's advance into Poland and the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War further deteriorated British-Soviet relations, almost forming a direct confrontation, thereby further promoting the alliance between the Soviet Union and Germany. If peace between the Soviet Union and Finland had not been achieved precisely before the European war spread to Denmark and Norway, the turmoil in Northern Europe would have intensified, forming a mixed war that would have further increased the difficulties for Britain and France. Looking further at British-Japanese relations, although British interests have been greatly infringed upon in the past two or three years and British public opinion is filled with support for China and opposition to Japan, the government's policy towards Japan has always tended towards leniency and compromise, from the Shanghai Customs Agreement at the end of 1938 to the intermittent Tokyo negotiations from last summer to the present. The result, however, has been nothing more than greater threats and more insults. Looking at the recent angry voices of British residents in Tianjin under blockade, the constant questioning of the British House of Commons on the policy towards Japan, and the awkwardness of the diplomatic authorities' evasive words, it can be seen that Britain's diplomacy towards Japan today, like its policy towards the Soviet Union, needs to be seriously reconsidered.

Since Britain expanded its blockade against Germany, the commercial relations between Germany and the Soviet Union and the commercial relations passing through the Soviet Union to reach Germany in the Pacific have become a serious problem. For Britain and France, this is a gap that must be plugged, and it is also a difficult hurdle intertwined with some complex diplomatic relations. This may be the key to whether Britain and France are friends or foes with the Soviet Union, and it may also be seen by the Japanese clique as a good opportunity to extort Britain and France. It was recently rumored that Britain was preparing to extend the blockade against Germany to the Far East, with Vladivostok as the most important target. Fortunately, Britain and France have not acted so recklessly and destructively, otherwise, they may have made an irreparable mistake, allowing the aggressors in the East to reap the benefits. In fact, the key to blocking the loophole in Germany's northeast border lies solely with the Soviet Union, and Britain and France have no need to seek help from the Japanese side. Moreover, the goods and equipment imported into Germany from the Pacific via Siberia are limited, and the frequent transshipments and high costs do not greatly help Germany. The sea and land transportation routes are all within Soviet territory, and only the Soviet Union has the power to manipulate them. Therefore, the nature of British-Soviet relations will be a major key to the future evolution of the European war. To strive for compromise with the Japanese clique while letting diplomacy with the Soviet Union take its course, whether this is due to the influence of ideological systems or the separation from the reality of facts, cannot be considered a sound policy in light of the national interests of Britain and France in extraordinary times.

Although political negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have become a thing of the past, the door to commercial negotiations has always been open. Looking at the repeated urgings of Soviet Ambassador Maisky to Britain, it can be seen that the Soviet Union does not want British-Soviet relations to continue to deteriorate. Now that this negotiation has just begun, it is not appropriate to place extravagant hopes on it immediately, but Britain must not neglect its importance and continue to let it drift in indifference. If the Allied powers can calmly and carefully consider how to improve relations with the Soviet Union, then even if they cannot make up for the failure of the previous tripartite negotiations, it will be of great benefit to the current position of Britain and France. On the other hand, the kind of negotiations that British Ambassador Craigie is conducting with Tani Masayuki in Tokyo may indeed have unavoidable difficulties for Britain, and it is still questionable how much success it can achieve. Moreover, this kind of negotiation will inevitably involve China's sovereignty and American public opinion, and the slightest carelessness can easily cause friction or resentment, and its gains and losses may not be mutually compensatory. Since Britain is calling on the world to curb aggression, it must not allow measures that violate its fundamental position to occur in the Far East. Rather than persistently clinging to the negotiations in Tokyo, it would be better to devote all efforts to promoting the improvement of British-Soviet relations. This, whether in Europe or the Far East, will have an effect that cannot be compared with obtaining unreliable promises from the Japanese clique.

### Ms. Agnes Smedley Says Japan Cannot Conquer China

Chongqing: American writer Ms. Agnes Smedley, who traveled with the Chinese guerrillas in central China for 18 months, declared to reporters from the United Press here today that Japan would never be able to rule the occupied areas of China, let alone conquer the whole of China. Ms. Smedley pointed out that in the year and a half since the fall of Hankou, the Japanese have only controlled the roads and walled cities. Ms. Smedley also said that she once followed a certain Chinese guerrilla unit to attack Hankou. Ms. Smedley arrived here last week. She served as a Red Cross member behind Japanese lines last August. According to her, the morale of the Japanese army had already been greatly lost last year. Currently, when the Chinese army attacks, the Japanese army always adopts a defensive posture. The Japanese army never dared to easily leave its defensive positions with only a small number of people unless they formed a large unit of hundreds of people, supplemented by full armament and heavy artillery. The Japanese are most afraid of fighting the Chinese in hand-to-hand combat. She also said that Japanese soldiers who behaved well did not know the truth. The Japanese army never failed to burn and plunder every village they went to. Ms. Smedley also criticized the United States for supplying the Japanese army with ammunition, saying that she felt sympathetic to the Chinese soldiers and civilians when she saw American-made bombs dropped by Japanese planes and Japanese planes burning American gasoline. Ms. Smedley made significant contributions to the organization and improvement of the armies in Anhui, Henan, and Hunan provinces. Ms. Smedley also said that the officers of the Guangxi army made a large contribution to the mobilization of the armies in those provinces. After leaving Anhui, Ms. Smedley also joined a guerrilla unit in northern Hubei. That guerrilla unit received much support from the people in its battles in Hubei, and the entire army showed a strong and unified image. The guerrillas in northern Hubei were not subsidized by the National Government, but they were still able to defeat the puppet army and prevent the Japanese army from venturing outside the city, even though they were poorly equipped.

### Japanese Person Ito's Commentary: American Naval Plan - Exerting Utmost Effort to Increase the Cruising Range of New Warships, Considering the Japanese Naval Zone as a Target for Operations

Tokyo – Ito, a renowned Japanese naval critic, recently published an article in the Japan Chronicle commenting on the American naval plan, stating approximately: The main objective of the new and under-design warships of the United States is to exert the utmost effort to increase their cruising range, so that they can adopt an offensive stance thousands of miles away. The reason is that the country regards the Western Pacific as nothing less than a hypothetical battlefield. The Craven-class destroyers among the country's newly built warships all have the possibility of operating in the waters near Japan. Their displacement is 1,500 tons, and their cruising range reaches 6,000 miles. This kind of "attack fleet" can be supplied with military supplies from the Pacific naval base, such as Wake Island and Midway Island, and can operate for more than a week following Japan's major trade routes before returning to join the main fleet without any difficulty. Given that their mere destroyers have a cruising range comparable to that of the battleships of the Washington Naval Conference era, the capabilities of other warships can be imagined. In terms of general naval strategy, if fifteen battleships cross the ocean for operations, at least ninety destroyers are required to cover them. Japan is paying attention to the American destroyer construction plan, believing that the country's navy is targeting the Western Pacific, that is, the "Japanese naval zone," for operations, and this is the reason. As for the American heavy cruisers, those stipulated to be built in the Vinson Naval Expansion Act also have "remarkable achievements." In short, the newly built battleships, cruisers, and destroyers of the United States all have a common characteristic, that is, the cruising range of each ship is very large. As for whether there are other weaknesses, let's not discuss them for now. Japan's newly built warships are unwilling to sacrifice firepower to increase cruising range. This proves that Japan's strategy is to engage in defense in the Western Pacific, with no intention of crossing the Pacific for operations. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

Washington – New York Republican Representative Fish yesterday condemned Rear Admiral Taussig, commander of the Fifth Naval District, for his statement to the Senate Naval Committee, saying it was "the most provocative and dangerous tone uttered by any naval officer today." Fish proposed that Congress should investigate the statements made by naval officers regarding war, "Whenever a naval program is proposed, they always launch a propaganda campaign. Taussig even told us that we should fortify the Philippines and Guam, and join the Anglo-French Allied Powers to defend Singapore." Recently, Japanese Ambassador to Washington Kensuke Horinouchi visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday, introducing Aisuke Kabayama, chairman of the Japan International Cultural Relations Society. They both denied discussing the new immigration bill for the Philippines, the problem of the Dutch East Indies, or Taussig's statement. Also, Libby, chairman of the National Council for Prevention of War, said yesterday that Chief of Naval Operations Stark "attempted to intimidate the United States and fabricate the story of Japan's powerful naval shipbuilding program in order to build a naval force beyond our needs." He said that this kind of argument, like that of Rear Admiral Taussig, is most likely to drag the United States into war. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

Tokyo – When the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received reporters today, someone asked about Rear Admiral Taussig's statement at the Senate Naval Committee hearing on April 22, which considered a war between the United States and Japan as inevitable. What were Japan's thoughts on this? The spokesperson replied, "I don't want to criticize it. It would be unwise for the Japanese to be overly sensitive." The spokesperson also recounted his experience of attending the U.S. Senate Naval Committee meeting, saying that these kinds of hearing meetings often express patriotic opinions on the extreme necessity of expanding the U.S. Navy to cover the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

### U.S. Lodges Verbal Protest with Japan - Intensifying the Blockade of the Tianjin Concession - Obstructing the Freedom of American People

Washington - According to official sources, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew lodged a verbal protest with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the intensification of the blockade of Tianjin, following the instructions of the U.S. government. The reason for the protest was that the intensified blockade obstructs the freedom of movement of American people. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 24th)

Tokyo - When the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received reporters today, he was asked whether U.S. Ambassador Grew had specifically questioned Japan's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Masayuki Tani, yesterday because the Japanese authorities in Tianjin were strictly blockading foreign concessions, causing great inconvenience to American expatriates. The spokesperson replied that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must convey this question to the local Japanese authorities, so he was unable to answer the U.S. Ambassador at this time. The spokesperson reiterated that the silver issue and the blockade of the concession were two separate matters. The blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin was due to the Japanese military authorities considering it militarily necessary. As for the silver issue, it has nothing to do with military affairs. However, when resolving these two issues, they may be related to each other in one or two aspects. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### U.S. Plans to Add Aircraft - Seventy-Two Squadrons - Director of Aeronautics Arnold - Presents Report to the Senate

Washington - Major General Arnold, Director of the Army Air Corps, recently submitted a report to the Senate Naval Committee, stating approximately that the current policy regarding the sale of new American aircraft to foreign countries is that a joint committee of relevant departments first decides whether the sale would harm the interests of the country. If it is considered harmless, it will be sold to foreign countries. This policy is quite beneficial, and the Army's current plan is to add 72 aircraft squadrons before June 30 of this year, bringing the total to 5,500 aircraft. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

### Guo Taiqi Delivers Speech in England

London - Chinese Ambassador to England Guo Taiqi delivered a speech at the British International Understanding Association today, stating that China, with its vast territory, large population, cultural heritage, and national spirit of seeking development in peace, will inevitably occupy a leading position in the Far East. It is difficult to be optimistic that the Japanese people will be able to break away from the control of the warlords in a considerable period of time. China occupies an important position in the relations between England and the United States, because the military and commercial interests of England and the United States are aligned in the Far East.

### Allied British and French Forces in Norway Advance Towards the Hama Front - Fierce Battle at Trondheim Harbor - Military Operations in Northern Norway Stalled Due to Wind and Snow

Stockholm, Sweden - According to sources here, a fierce battle is taking place near Lillehammer, where the Gudbrandsdal valley, the gateway to Oslo in central Norway, enters the southern plains. British and Norwegian troops are attacking towards Hama. Although they have encountered strong German resistance, they have finally reached Morf. (Reuters on the 24th)

Stockholm, Sweden - Correspondents report that five days of wind and snow have stalled military operations in Narvik. Although German aircraft bombed various towns and communication lines, reinforcements continued to advance towards Lillehammer from the Gudbrandsdal valley. It is reported that fresh Allied troops have arrived in Namsos despite German air raids. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

London - Regarding the Norwegian war, well-informed sources here recently stated that Trondheim Harbor is one of the main targets of the Allied operations. The northern troops of the Allied forces landed at Namsos Harbor and the southern troops landed at Andalsnes Harbor are advancing separately towards Trondheim Harbor. Among them, the northern troops have already reached Stenkjer (north of Trondheim Harbor) and have made contact with German troops. The southern troops have approached Storlien, an important stronghold on the Trondheim Harbor to Oslo railway line. If they can capture the city, the supply sources of the German troops in Trondheim Harbor can be completely cut off. In addition, after the Allied forces advanced towards Hama, they have already placed most of this railway line under control. Once the Allied forces capture Trondheim Harbor and use the navy in the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits to take decisive actions to prevent German transportation, Germany's risky actions in the Scandinavian Peninsula can be brought to an end. As for the issue of supplying munitions and transporting troops in this war, it is extremely important for the German army. Since the German airfields in Denmark and Norway have been repeatedly bombed by Allied aircraft, their aerial transportation has been greatly hindered. In addition, as far as the war in northern Norway is concerned, the British and French Allied forces and the Norwegian army are cooperating in the Narvik area. The Norwegian army there is well-equipped, well-trained, and has extremely strong combat power. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

Berlin - This afternoon, German military experts stated that the German army's occupation of the key point of Jernfjellet at the northeastern end of Trondheim Bay is of particular importance, because after the German army occupies this place, it can prevent the enemy from attacking Trondheim from the north. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)

Stockholm, Sweden - According to sources here, the first test of strength between the Allied and Norwegian troops and German forces in the Trondheim area will approximately take place north of Stenkjer, or in the Snasa area between Hell and Grong. Allied troops have rapidly advanced from the landing points to the area. At the same time, according to sources here, Allied and Norwegian troops have been forced to abandon several outpost positions, but this is only a temporary situation. Many Norwegians express satisfaction with the situation. German troops in southern Norway are advancing north from Elverum and have been blocked by the Norwegians at Osan, 25 miles northeast of Elverum. Correspondents from various newspapers have different opinions on the number of Allied troops in the city, but the most common estimate is 17,000. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

German Reinforcements Sent to the Front Lines

Berlin - The official German news agency stated that German reinforcements have arrived in the Bergen and Trondheim areas. There was a two-hour battle north of Trondheim, and the enemy was defeated. The situation in Narvik has not changed significantly. New German supplies have been transported, and British troops near Narvik also have some activities. British cruisers bombarded Narvik aimlessly. German troops have not made contact with the enemy because the landed enemy troops are quite far from Narvik. Andalsnes was heavily damaged by German bombing, and the landed British troops were attacked all day from dawn, suffering heavy losses. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

German Army Maintains Air Supremacy in Norway

Stockholm, Sweden - According to sources here, British troops are operating in at least four locations in Norway. In some places north of Trondheim, British and German troops are less than 200 yards apart. Currently, the German army maintains air supremacy because the Allied army's anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes are noticeably lacking. However, although German aircraft have carried out repeated air raids, the British defense lines have not been damaged. Only the British headquarters has moved twice. The ability of German aircraft to quickly discover the location of the British headquarters makes one suspect the existence of a well-established spy system. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

Fierce Battle Between German and Norwegian Troops in Southeastern Highlands

Berlin - The official report released here last night stated that German and Norwegian troops had a fierce battle today in the mountainous area southeast of Stavanger. Most of a Norwegian division has surrendered to the German army. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)

Stockholm, Sweden - The Norwegian military headquarters announced that artillery tanks and aircraft assisted in continuing the attack. The German army also attacked the Norwegian army in Osden. The Norwegian army in Vatlais has made progress. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### British Aircraft Bomb German Air Force Bases - Hangar on Sylt Island Catches Fire After Being Hit - Airfields in Denmark and Norway Are Heavily Damaged

London - The Air Ministry announced that Royal Air Force aircraft heavily bombed the Westerland airfield on Sylt Island last night, with great success. Bombs landed on the hangars and runways, and fires broke out in several places, with one large explosion. British aircraft encountered enemy patrol boats north of the island, and the ships fired anti-aircraft guns fiercely. British aircraft returned fire, sinking two of them. British aircraft also attacked the enemy air force bases in Aalborg, Kristiansand, Oslo, and Stavanger, and conducted offensive reconnaissance over Trondheim. Detailed reports have not yet been received, but according to preliminary reports, all operations were very successful. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

Berlin - British aircraft attacked Sylt Island again last night, dropping ten bombs, but the damage was minimal. The German searchlights were extremely sensitive, and the anti-aircraft fire was very fierce, so the British aircraft were repelled. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 24th)

The news agency also said that artillery fire was also heard yesterday from the Swedish islands of Källingö and Årn, continuously throughout the day, and a distress signal was heard from a warship, which was apparently about to sink. However, the news agency did not specify the nationality of the sinking ship. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

### Sweden Exerts Utmost Effort to Avoid Being Drawn into the War - National Unity - Strong Defense Forces

Stockholm, Sweden - Admiral Lindström, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, recently delivered a speech to naval officers and soldiers, stating approximately that there are two reasons why Sweden has not been drawn into the war: (1) Our country has strong defense capabilities; (2) Our people are completely united under the leadership of King Gustav and the government. In addition, the opposition Social Democratic Party has accepted the proposal of the Conservative and Liberal parties and decided to jointly hold a demonstration on May 1, that is, Labor Day. At that time, the parties will jointly form teams to march, rather than doing so individually. The national unity is evident in this. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

London - Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the British government, because Soviet Ambassador to England Maisky recently proposed continuing Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations, has asked the Soviet government to submit specific proposals for concluding a trade agreement for consideration, because any trade agreement with neutral countries must take into account the current war situation, especially supplying the enemy with essential goods. Butler also said that the date of return for the British ambassador to the Soviet Union has not yet been determined. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### British Second Wartime Budget - Totaling 2.6 Billion Pounds - Huge Tax Revenue Numbers Open a New Chapter in Fiscal History - Chancellor of the Exchequer Urges National Thrift to Achieve Victory

London - When British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon presented his second wartime budget, he claimed that the 500 million pounds of funds approved by the House of Commons now had a surplus of 91 million pounds, or that various departments should be blamed for this surplus because they failed to prepare for war as quickly as they should have. In fact, this accusation is completely unfair, because the detailed audit of the expenses of various departments may differ from the general estimates when the budget was passed. The actual expenditure in the past year was 1,816,873,000 pounds, not the 1,933,000,000 pounds of the emergency budget, so a total of 116,500,000 pounds was accumulated under last year's expenditure. In addition to this, there is something even more exciting: the income budget was originally 995,000,000 pounds, but the actual revenue exceeded this amount by 54,000,000 pounds (applause). People enthusiastically paid the increased income tax and surtax. Almost all of the income tax and surtax estimated in September last year were collected in full, with income tax revenue of 390,000,000 pounds. This is the largest income tax revenue in a single year. During the first year of the last World War, a total of 59,000,000 pounds was collected in income tax, while the previous session collected 390,000,000 pounds, which is more than six times higher. The previous surtax collected a total of 69,750,000 pounds, while only 10,000,000 pounds were collected in the first year of the last World War. Death duties also collected more than 2 million pounds more than budgeted. The defense contribution collected approximately 27,000,000 pounds. This budget collected approximately 2 million pounds more. Excess profits tax revenue was 40,000 pounds. Domestic tax revenue was 587,000,000 pounds, an increase of 8,250,000 pounds over the budget. Customs and excise tax revenue was 400,000,000 pounds, an increase of 27,500,000 pounds over the budget. Tobacco tax revenue increased by 9,700,000 pounds over the budget. Sugar tax revenue increased by 4,600,000 pounds. Beer tax revenue increased by 750,000 pounds. And the most surprising unexpected increase was in vehicle tax. When he proposed increasing the private vehicle tax to 25 shillings per horsepower, he estimated that 22 million pounds could be collected, but the actual revenue has reached 34 million pounds. On the one hand, the government does not encourage wasteful travel by car, and on the other hand, it maintains the source of tax revenue. The net income of the post office has not exceeded the estimate of September last year. Statistically, the expenditure in the previous session was 1,817,000,000 pounds, and the income was 1,049,000,000 pounds. The difference between the two was 768,000,000 pounds, which was made up by borrowing. In September last year, he estimated that 938,000,000 pounds would need to be borrowed to cover last year's expenses, but the situation today is much better than expected last year.

### Military Expenditure Accounts for 2 Billion Pounds

The problems ahead are even more serious. The national debt has increased from 8,163,000,000 pounds at the beginning of this year to 8,931,000,000 pounds at the end of March. The government will inevitably request approval of expenses at any time this year, and the number requested is only listed as an integer for the sake of public interest without detailed distinction of the expenses of various departments, so as not to let the enemy know about the United Kingdom's construction of new ships or increase in air force. The first request for funds this year was 700,000,000 pounds and was passed on March 13, but it is extremely difficult to estimate how much funding is needed for the entire 12 months. In the first seven months of this war, the war cost was 905,000,000 pounds. Based on this calculation, approximately 1,500,000,000 pounds will be needed for 12 months. However, such an estimate is not accurate, because war costs are increasing day by day, and it is inevitable and reasonable that they will increase. Therefore, he estimates that by the end of March next year, the war cost alone will be approximately 2,000,000,000 pounds. In addition to this 2,000,000,000 pounds, he also needs to add the national debt redemption fund and civil expenditures. The estimated appropriation for the national debt redemption fund is 247,000,000 pounds, and the usual estimate for civil expenditures, including civil defense, is 420,000,000 pounds. Together, the above figures total 2,667,000,000 pounds, which is the funding required for this term. The issue of economizing on public spending is a matter of constant concern for enlightened people in the country. For the sake of final victory, the people of this country should be prepared to accept the burden of this budget without complaint, because they should feel that the government is doing its best to eliminate waste, and what they pay is only what is necessary.

### Statement by the Minister of Finance on Tax Revenue Plan

The Minister of Finance has been discussing the issue of how much revenue could be continuously collected from the existing tax rates. It is estimated that the fixed tax revenue could be £85,000,000, stamp duty £19,000,000, national defense contributions and excess profits tax £70,000,000. Inland revenue, based on existing tax rules, could reach £658,000,000, an increase of £75,000,000 compared to last year. Customs duties and excise duties collected £400,000,000 last year. Based on this, it is estimated that £420,000,000 can be collected this year, and automobile tax can reach £35,000,000. The Minister of Finance stated that the government has decided to include postal revenue into the Ministry of Finance. The government will consider struggling industries. Given the wartime situation, the government has to postpone the re-evaluation of property values for income tax collection. The Ministry of Finance proposes amending legislation to address property tax evasion. Regarding customs duties and excise duties, he proposed enacting legislation on two points: first, to improve the export drawback system to support export trade, and second, related to the Imperial Sugar Preference system, to continue the existing preferences until the end of August 1942. The Minister of Finance also stated that, according to last year's method, the income could be £1,133,000,000. However, this total amount requires higher taxes, so he has to pay attention to both direct and indirect taxes. In the future, income tax will increase from seven shillings to seven shillings and six pence, and those with an annual income of more than £1,500 will be subject to surtax. The telephone tax will increase to 15%. A new tax calculated as a percentage will be levied on wholesale sales to retailers, except for food, beverages, fuel for humans and livestock, and heavily taxed items such as tobacco. The beer tax will increase by one penny per pint. The whisky tax will increase by one shilling and nine pence per bottle. The tobacco tax will increase by four shillings per pound. The match tax will be fifty pence per gross. Inland letter postage will increase by one penny. Overseas postage will increase to three pence instead of two and a half pence. The standard alcohol tax will increase by fifteen shillings per gallon, totaling ninety-seven shillings and six pence.

Increase in Income Tax Standard

When announcing the plan to increase the standard income tax from seven shillings to seven shillings and six pence and to reduce income tax deductions, the Minister of Finance stated that the tax increase is very high, and the burden of direct taxes in this country is higher than before. Within a year, the standard rate of income tax has increased from five shillings and six pence to seven shillings and six pence, plus surtax, its highest rate will reach seventeen shillings per pound. Whether in wartime or peacetime, these tax rates are unprecedented. In 1918, the highest income tax rate was only six shillings, or ten shillings and six pence per pound including surtax. A married person with no children, if having an annual income of £300, must pay £15 in income tax, instead of £7 last year and £5 the year before. And those who earn £400 a year must pay £30 twelve shillings and six pence in income tax, instead of £17 ten shillings last year and £12 twelve shillings and six pence the year before. Anyone with an annual income of £600 must pay £92 sixteen shillings and six pence in income tax, instead of £73 ten shillings last year and £56 twelve shillings and six pence the year before. This change, as well as minor changes, can generate £42,000,000 in direct taxes this year, and £61,750,000 for the whole year. There is also a change in the surtax, that is, those whose annual income exceeds £1,500 but not £2,000 in 1940-41 will have to pay surtax.

Indirect Taxes Increased Significantly

As for indirect taxes, the beer tax will increase by one penny per pint from April 24, which can bring in £18,000,000 for the whole year, and £15,000,000 in this financial year. The French government also abandoned its treaty rights, allowing French alcohol imported into the United Kingdom to be subject to increased taxes. Therefore, from today, after increasing the standard alcohol tax by fifteen shillings per gallon, it can bring in £7,000,000 for the whole year, and £6,500,000 in this financial year. The tobacco tax will increase by four shillings per pound from today, or three pence per ounce, and taxes on cigars and other items will also be increased accordingly. Two tax increases on this item within a year are indeed burdensome, but in the current financial situation, it is impossible not to increase taxes. It is estimated that the tobacco tax can increase to £23,000,000 for the whole year, and £21,000,000 in this financial year. The excise tax on matches will be doubled from April 29, and customs duties will also be increased accordingly. A box of matches with fifty sticks, which originally cost one penny, will now cost one and a half pence. In this financial year, this tax can bring in more than £3,500,000, and £4,000,000 for the whole year. Lighters will also be taxed appropriately. As for postage, the increase is for certain initial postage rates, but the fees for exceeding weight will remain unchanged. The domestic postage increase rates are as follows: letters weighing no more than two ounces will increase from one and a half pence to two and a half pence, postcards will increase from one penny to two pence, printed matter will increase by half a penny per item, and newspapers will increase by half a penny. The overseas postage increase rates are as follows: letters will increase from two and a half pence to two pence, and airmail will not be charged. It is estimated that the increase in postage can bring in £10,400,000 in this financial year, and £11,000,000 for the whole year. Domestic telephone fees, whether for business or public use, will increase by 15% from May 1, and private telephone fees will increase by 25%. This item can collect £2,000,000 in this financial year, and £2,500,000 for the whole year. Domestic telegraph fees will increase by three pence for each ordinary or congratulatory telegram from July 1, and news telegrams will also increase by three pence per page. Private telegrams will increase by 25%. This item can collect about £160,000 in this financial year, and £240,000 for the whole year. Overseas telegrams and telephone calls will be restricted during wartime, and there are no plans to increase prices at this time. It is estimated that £12,500,000 can be obtained in this financial year, and £14,500,000 for the whole year.

Purchase Tax Collection Method

The Minister of Finance then mentioned a new tax, saying that various countries and British dominions levy different types of sales taxes, but the methods are different. What he is proposing now is a purchase tax, which is levied as a percentage of the price when wholesalers sell to retailers. Such taxation has a great convenience, that is, it is easy to implement. Goods for export are not subject to purchase tax. While the government promotes the movement to increase exports, it should also limit unnecessary domestic waste. Raw materials required by industries are not subject to purchase tax. Food and beverages for cattle and livestock, as well as heavily taxed items such as tobacco and petroleum, or fuels, gas, electricity, and water, are also exempt from purchase tax. The date and tax rate for the implementation of this tax will be stipulated by the House of Commons. According to statistics, the income from special tax increases this year is a total of £101,000,000, plus the tax revenue of £1,133,000,000 obtained based on last year's tax rates, the two together total £1,234,000,000. If the purchase tax can be passed, he hopes that there will be some gains by the end of this year. However, the central issue of this budget is even more important than taxes, which is how to raise the huge sum of £1,433,000,000. He opposes the suggestion of forcing the people to save a portion of their income. He believes that it is appropriate to extremely encourage the people to respond to the government's current borrowing methods, which will definitely be effective. This huge sum of money must be raised. The government must improve the situation to encourage free contribution to the government and avoid inflation. Any plan that can help to limit consumption and misuse of power is important. The government's policy is to make the prices of necessary foods reasonable, even if this move costs the national treasury a lot. The government is now using 60 million pounds to suppress the prices of certain necessary foods. Many companies have been controlled, and foreign exchange has also been controlled.

Advantages of Excess Profits Tax

The Minister of Finance mentioned the excess profits tax, saying that excess profits would lose their value if distributed freely as dividends, but it would be very beneficial if used to support businesses and reorganize enterprises during difficult times after the end of the war. However, if scattered into the hands of shareholders, it would only tempt shareholders to use it for consumption. Therefore, he proposed to restrict dividends through company law, stipulating that ordinary dividends should not be greater than the dividends of any of the three years before the war, and companies that have not been able to pay dividends in recent years can be allowed to pay dividends at their discretion. In order to make this plan thorough, he proposed to prohibit the issuance of bonus stocks during the war, except for special reasons for the merger of two companies (cheers).

British Minister of Finance Concludes Speech

The Minister of Finance concluded by saying that the total tax revenue he wants to obtain this year is £1,234,000,000, which is indeed the largest figure for annual tax revenue in British financial history. However, since the expenditure caused by modern warfare is so huge, taxes have to be increased accordingly. According to his calculations, this year will inevitably require at least £85,000,000 more in expenses than last year. He now plans to obtain £185,000,000 more in tax revenue. What will the outcome be? Saving and lending savings to the country must be proportionally increased. The realization of this move is an important part of Britain's war aims. If the people always maintain current loans and pay government taxes, then we have nothing to worry about, because our financial front is also as strong as other fronts in the struggle for victory (cheers).

Opposition Party States Opinions

Labor Party leader Attlee commented on Simon's budget speech, expressing approval for the increase in taxes on beer, alcohol, tobacco, and matches, but believing that the postal tax may not generate much income, but instead cause resentment among most people. Simon's advocacy of automatic savings and opposition to forced savings is also welcomed by him. Liberal leader Sinclair said that Simon's statement on the budget difficulties is very clear. No one can accuse his proposed methods of being too harsh. Germany spent £2,300,000,000 on the war this year, and the efforts made by the French people are greater than what Simon asked of the British people. He believes that Simon has demonstrated the greatness of British financial power to the House of Commons, and the House of Commons' acceptance of his proposals can also prove the noble spirit and firm purpose of a united and determined Britain to win (Reuters, 23rd).

### British Newspapers' Comments, All Expressing Goodwill

London - Today's special dispatch from here states that the general British newspapers have a quite favorable attitude towards the huge British budget. Although the newspapers have slightly different opinions on the purchase tax and indirect taxes, they all fully recognize that tax increases are inevitable. To win the war, any sacrifice is not considered too great. Some newspapers call this budget "bold and realistic," "a fierce war tool," "serious and fair," and "very faithful." The Manchester Guardian even commented that the budget is still not severe enough, saying that it is more moderate than what the situation requires. The Times reported that this budget has a very great achievement, that is, it has no concealment or rhetoric to ease people's hearts about the truth of our financial situation. Judging from its huge figures, it can prove how strong the financial situation is, and how it will not shrink from dealing with all difficulties. The British people have full determination to make the sacrifices needed for the war. The Allied countries can exert their full strength as soon as possible, and victory can be achieved sooner, and the country's expenditure can be reduced. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Minister of Finance Simon knows that making a bold and realistic statement on the issue of dealing with the huge expenses of modern warfare can win the unanimous support of the country, and make full use of various guarantees. The taxes he increased are few and simple, but the "purchase tax" has entered a new stage. It is not yet known how this tax will be implemented, and it must be carefully considered to avoid injustices and overreach. As for the ability of this tax to generate huge tax revenue, there is no doubt. In short, this budget is a strong appeal to the public, and it is an ideal effort to grasp a major problem. The Daily Herald reported that the main burden will be borne by people with small incomes, and indirect taxes often impose the highest tax amounts on those with the fewest resources, because those who collect this tax are all ordinary consumer goods. The News Chronicle reported that this budget will definitely impress the world with the heavy financial burden we bear. Although the new taxes currently levied are quite heavy, they are not surprising. The Minister of Finance has clearly recognized that fighting a total war requires huge expenditures. The Daily Mail, in addition to criticizing the "purchase tax" as being unfavorable to shop owners and traders, expressed approval for the increase in various indirect taxes. The Daily Express said that although indirect taxes will cause prices to rise, they can limit the consumption of some imported goods. The new tax on tobacco can save our US dollars, and the increase in the price of matches can save the supply of wood. However, the purchase tax is a mystery, and the Minister of Finance has not explained it (Reuters, 24th).

### Soviet Union Has Absolutely No Aggressive Ambitions Towards Finland and Sweden - The German-Soviet Agreement Does Not Contain Political Nature - Deeply Concerned About the Balkan Situation

London - A responsible spokesman for the Soviet Union declared to the International News Service today that the Soviet Union has no aggressive ambitions towards Finland and Sweden. The agreement signed between the country and Germany also has no political nature. Therefore, the country can enter into any agreement with Britain in accordance with its own interests, without having to consider Germany's reaction. In addition, the Soviet Union is extremely concerned about the Balkans. If the countries of the Balkan Peninsula are invaded, regardless of whether the invading country is Germany or Italy, it cannot stand idly by (International News Service, 24th).

### Important Negotiations Between Britain and Italy - Related to the Blockade Issue

Rome - Rome and London are conducting important negotiations on the blockade issue. It is expected that a compromise plan will be established this week to clarify British-Italian relations. If there are no drastic changes, Italy can be expected to permanently maintain neutrality (International News Service, 24th).

### Negotiating War Against Germany - Maintaining Effective Cooperation - New Resolutions of the Supreme Allied Military Council of Britain and France - Norway and Poland Also Participate as Members

Paris - The 8th Joint Meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France was held yesterday and today. Important figures from Norway and Poland also participated, thus becoming a true "War Conference of Allied Countries." According to the communiqué issued afterwards, "In order for the governments of the Allied Countries to promptly fulfill their obligations and jointly protect their interests in order to counter all hostile actions, they exchanged views on all important political and military issues that require close attention. After reviewing the general war situation, various new decisions were taken to ensure that the Allied Countries can implement effective cooperation in all circumstances. Polish Prime Minister General Sikorski declared that the country's government, army, and people are determined to continue fighting with all resources. At this moment, they are actively adjusting and developing all manpower and material resources. The participating countries admired their every effective contribution. The prime ministers of Britain, France, and Poland then asked the Norwegian representative, Ambassador to France, Bakke, to convey to his government that Britain, France, and Poland admired the heroic resistance of the Norwegian people under the leadership of King Haakon VII. Ambassador Ke also expressed his gratitude on behalf of his government for the prompt assistance of the Allied Countries." After the meeting, the British representatives returned to London at 2:30 p.m. Government officials here commented on the decisions taken at this session, saying that the determination of the Allied Countries to fulfill all obligations, protect their interests, and resist all "conspiracies" has been seen more quickly here. In addition, one thing is worth noting, that is, this joint meeting was originally composed of representatives from Britain and France. Due to the participation of important figures from Norway and Poland, it has gradually become a common organization among the Allied Countries. In other words, any country that has been invaded and is determined to resist in order to fulfill its international obligations can participate (Havas, 23rd).

Paris - When the 8th Joint Meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France was held, the attitude that each country should adopt towards the situation in Southeastern Europe was submitted for discussion. Regarding Romania and Greece, the guarantees provided by the British and French governments last year are still valid. If any of these countries are invaded by foreign countries, Britain and France will immediately come to their aid. In addition, if the "interests" that Britain and France maintain in Southeastern Europe are harmed, they will definitely deal with them. In this way, even if countries in Southeastern Europe have not been provided with guarantees by Britain and France, if they are invaded, Britain and France will also intervene. This general statement is of great significance. As for the rumors that Britain and France intend to notify Italy of this attitude, it is not accurate. Italy has no intention of interfering in Southeastern Europe. Judging from the guarantee provided by the country to Greece on April 10 last year, its meaning is clear, which shows that the saying that Italy has ulterior motives is not reliable. Even the arguments of Italian newspapers cannot be confused with the policies of the country's government. Generally speaking, Germany seems to be using strong pressure on Italy at the moment. Italy has no choice but to adopt German propaganda slogans in the newspapers and publish comments to support Germany. The country will still avoid any actions that would terminate Italy's current status as a non-belligerent country (Havas, 24th).

Swiss Capital - The "Basler Nachrichten" recently carried a telegram from a Berlin correspondent stating that after the Norwegian representative participated in the 8th Joint Meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to formally declare war on Norway, so as to end the nominally peaceful state between Germany and Norway (Havas, 24th).

### Canadian Prime Minister Visits US President

Warm Springs, Georgia, USA - Canadian Prime Minister King has arrived here and traveled by car to President Roosevelt's villa. President Roosevelt greeted him and shook hands with King in a happy conversation. President Roosevelt then told reporters that King's visit had no political significance (Reuters, 24th).

Warm Springs - President Roosevelt met with Canadian Prime Minister King at 10:20 a.m. today and talked with each other. Afterwards, according to a statement issued by President Secretary Lise, "The President and the Canadian Prime Minister have known each other for more than 30 years. The Canadian Prime Minister must come to the United States once a year to relive old times with the President, but it has absolutely no political significance. Even in this case, no political issues between the United States or the Canadian Federation were discussed." (Havas, 23rd)

### Hayman Advocates Stopping Silver Purchases

New York - Hayman, General Manager of the National Credit Bank Association, advocated in the association's "Commercial Report" that the United States should stop buying foreign silver. It is said that "If we think it is beneficial to subsidize the domestic silver industry, then we should stop buying foreign silver. The silver policy of 1934, we are now achieving the opposite effect, and have not benefited. China's abolition of the silver currency system is obviously influenced by our silver policy. The increase in foreign purchasing power is all assisted by our purchase of silver." He said that Americans should support the news program currently proposed in Congress, which advocates stopping silver purchases. "If we review the past records, we can prove the error of the silver purchase policy. The Treasury Department has two purposes for purchasing silver: (1) to increase the value of silver to $1.29 per ounce; (2) to accumulate silver to one-third of our country's reserves. Since 1934, our country has purchased as much as 900,000,000 ounces of foreign silver (excluding American mined silver), but the price of silver has not reached $1.29 per ounce, and silver has reached one-third of the reserve standard, which is even lower than before we purchased silver, because our gold inflow is even more than the silver we purchased." Continuing to discuss the domestic business situation and the possibility of increasing foreign trade this year, Hayman said, "Some indications show that the recent business situation is gradually declining, but it is hoped that exports in the most recent month can have a considerable improvement. When we increase foreign trade, we should consider several factors, one of which is the ability of foreign countries to repay exports in the long term after the current credit funds are exhausted. This should depend on whether we are willing to accept greater imports. The ability of exports and imports should also depend on the maintenance of maritime transportation lines. In short, for the outlook for 1940, we believe that the favorable ones, and if it cannot exceed this year, it should be equal to the commercial record of 1939." (United Press, 24th)

### Zhejiang University Moved from Guizhou to Qian; Classes Resumed in Zunyi; Now Has Five Colleges

(Zunyi Correspondence) In the summer of the 1938th year of the Republic of China, National Zhejiang University moved from western Jiangxi, originally designated Anshun in Guizhou Province as the location of the temporary campus. Later, because Jiangxi and Guizhou were far apart, and all the school's books and instruments, nineteen of which were taken out when leaving Hangzhou, amounted to no less than 2,000 boxes, and the number of teachers and students exceeded 1,000, long-distance transportation was both difficult and time-consuming. With the welcome of local people from Guangxi Province, the school temporarily stopped in Yishan in Guangxi Province, in order to save national funds and seek to resume classes as soon as possible. The school moved to Yishan in September of the year before last and lasted for more than a year until January of this year. In February of last year, it suffered an intentional bombing by Japanese aircraft, but it quickly resumed operations to ensure that studies continued without interruption. However, since the Japanese army landed in Beihai last fall, followed by the fall of Nanning, China's brave land and air forces repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on them in various places in southern Guangxi, causing them to be on the verge of annihilation. However, air raid alarms in Yishan were almost constant, and sometimes lasted all day. All the students were constantly evacuating to avoid air raid alarms, which wasted time and neglected studies, resulting in unimaginable losses to teaching. Therefore, it was necessary to revisit the original plan to move to Guizhou Province to seek a stable life and facilitate the transmission of academic studies. When the Japanese army moved north from Nanning last winter, the school continued to maintain classes in Yishan while sending personnel to Guizhou to prepare for a temporary campus. At the same time, a group of students organized a battlefield service corps to work on the front lines of Qianjiang, Baoyang, and Kunlun Pass for many days, working hard and enduring hardship, achieving remarkable results, and receiving praise from various anti-Japanese armies. At the beginning of this year, the school was presided over by the relocation committee, and began to move north, setting up stations along the way to transport staff, students, books, and instruments. It was again supported by the local authorities of Guizhou Province and various transportation sectors, and the relocation matters were brought to a conclusion in the recent period. Currently, only a small number of secondary books and instruments are still being transported, and it is expected to be completed within two or three weeks. The school's new first-year students and preparatory class students in the 29th year, totaling more than 400, resumed classes on February 8 at the temporary campus in Qingyan, south of Guiyang. More than 500 students in the second, third, and fourth grades also resumed classes on April 22 at the temporary campus in Zunyi. Everything has been largely restored. However, because the school has a large number of people and a lot of equipment, the required housing funds are considerable. Furthermore, considering that the school is divided into two locations in Guizhou Province (the school also has a Longquan branch in Zhejiang Province), teaching is often inconvenient, and the current campuses are all temporary in nature. Therefore, it has recently been planning a relatively permanent campus near Zunyi, in order to concentrate teaching and experimentation and benefit advanced research. The school's organization is currently divided into five colleges: Arts, Sciences, Engineering, Agriculture, and Teacher's College. The College of Arts has three departments: Chinese Literature, Foreign Languages and Literature, and History and Geography. The College of Science has four departments: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The College of Engineering has four departments: Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The College of Agriculture has six departments: Agronomy, Agricultural Chemistry, Horticulture, Plant Pathology and Entomology, Sericulture, and Agricultural Economics. The Teacher's College has five departments: Education, Chinese Literature, English, History and Geography, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. The College of Arts also has a Research Institute of Arts, a Department of History and Geography, and a Research Office of History and Geography Education. The College of Science also has a Teaching Department of the Research Institute of Science. The College of Engineering has an affiliated factory. The College of Agriculture has an affiliated farm. The Teacher's College has an affiliated experimental school, divided into middle school and elementary school departments. The library has about 60,000 books, excluding those stored at the Longquan branch, half Chinese and half Western.

### Qilu University's Research Work in Chinese Studies

(Chengdu Correspondence) After the July 7th Incident, Qilu University moved from Jinan to Chengdu and built temporary school buildings for classes. The original Research Institute of Chinese Studies was suspended after the incident. In the autumn of the 28th year, the Research Institute was rebuilt, and Gu Jiegang was hired to preside over the institute's affairs.

### Gongzhan Cup Handball Tournament; Second Round Completed

China Youth Failed by One Point; Third Round to Determine the Winner

The 10th Gongzhan Cup Handball Tournament, the second round, in order for the new players to have more practice opportunities, the China Youth team did not have a must-win mentality in the second round. Last night was the main battle between the first and second groups. The handball king Zhu Kuan and the veteran Sun Daosheng, with their heroic strategies and clever plans, purely took advantage of their intelligence. As a result, they won with a score of 2 to 1. In the end, the first doubles team Yan Peiqiu and Hua Fenggang played. After the other side Huam Tiao and F. Quikling cooperated (Huam was originally the second doubles), after a fierce battle in three rounds, Yan Hua preserved their strength and suffered a setback with a score of 1 to 2. In total, the victory in the second round went to the West Youth team, with a score of 8 to 7. The two China and West Youth teams have each won one round. Who will win the championship?

In this second round, the West Youth team used Keqi Miluo, who had not been registered, to play in the tenth singles match, which violated the rules, which is very regrettable. In principle, the China Youth team could protest, but for the sake of sportsmanship and spirit, they are only given a warning.

Zhu Kuan 13-21 M. Quikling

### Amidst a Chorus of Selling; the Gold Market is Unbearable to Look Back On; Has Fallen for Five Consecutive Days to $162

The cash gold informal market situation yesterday, first fell and then rebounded, the falling trend became increasingly intense, unbearable to look back. It is estimated that it has fallen for five consecutive days, pressing on $200.

The situation was quite good at first, opening at $5,735, and gold firms and bank gangs had quickly reached $5,748. However, the good times were short-lived. After that, it fell sharply. Securities firms, money changers, and retail investors gathered to sell, and gold firms were even willing to sell limited盘 at $5,720.

Securities firms entered 50 taels of money exchange industry, at $5,748. After that, the bank gang suddenly started selling, and another securities firm also had 塞出, and the market situation suddenly turned around, retreating to within the $5,730. However, at that time, a gold firm saw the cheap limited price buy-in, which was small, and once relied on it to stand firm. However, not long after, the gold firm stopped buying, immediately retreating to $5,720. Unexpectedly, at that time, the gold firm suddenly settled for the retail investors, and there were no buyers, and it dropped again to the $5,700 mark. After breaking into the $5,700 mark, the bank gang and other floating long positions also settled one after another, and then fell to $50, and the bank sold to the money exchange industry 10 taels, at a price of $5,650 low. Near the close, a money exchange industry raised the price to buy, and then rebounded by $15. The money exchange entered 20 taels of gold firms, at $5,665 as the afternoon closing price. As a result, it fell again by $57 from the previous day, with fluctuations of $98 in half a day. It has been falling for five consecutive days, totaling $162.

Yesterday, the over-the-counter market for Unified Public Bonds, after several days of decline, showed a slight tendency to stabilize. However, due to the excessive accumulation of funds, foreign exchange arbitrage exceeding five percent, and the dramatic rise and fall of foreign stocks, speculators abandoned bonds in favor of foreign stocks, leading to a continuous outflow of physical bonds and widespread anxiety. Buyers were hesitant, and large-scale bullish investors, burdened by high overnight interest rates and difficulties in turnover since last week, saw their potential greatly diminished. Consequently, they became cautious in their purchases, causing the market atmosphere to suddenly become quiet, with prices fluctuating. However, during the session, there was a slight strengthening, showing signs of recovery. When the market opened in the morning, Sheng, Tongji, Hengkang, Yitai, and others initially pushed prices down, causing them to weaken considerably. Subsequently, Dakang, Chengjiu, Fenglian, and Tongshun successively raised prices, returning them to two or three jiao higher. Afternoon trading was scarce, with little to report. Only sporadic buying and selling created a slightly uneven market. As a result, except for Type B bonds, which remained down by a small five fen, all others rose by five fen to two jiao and a half. Trading volume decreased sharply to just over 600,000 yuan.

The stock market at the Public Exchange yesterday was generally calm, with prices fluctuating little. Most of the increased quantity was absorbed. Jardine Matheson shares showed a very erratic trend, with prices fluctuating between 215 and 235 yuan. Union Insurance shares were very active, with prices rebounding due to the resolution of the dockworkers' strike. China Land Investment shares continued to rise, with a trading volume of over 41,000 shares. The closing price was 29.5 yuan with buyers. Rubber shares fell slightly, and the market was dull. Due to the large trading volume in the previous few days, the authorities have decided to suspend trading on Friday (the 26th) afternoon to accommodate the busy settlement work. The market will be closed as usual on Saturday.

London, 23rd (Tuesday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds have slightly fallen in the high range and remained stable in the low range. The Crisp Loan fell by 1.5 pounds to 71.5 pounds, and the Reorganization Loan bonds fell by 1 pound to 36 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

London, 23rd (Tuesday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of British Far Eastern companies' stocks showed mixed gains and losses. HSBC shares fell by half a pound to 93 pounds.

This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Li Tongyi discussing the future of stocks and the necessary considerations, stating, "The true value of stocks should be judged based on the sustainability or temporary prosperity of the business, the state of assets and liabilities, and the distribution of profits. However, since the success of the China Land Investment Company, some stocks in the Public Exchange have reached rare high prices. The market only hears of someone earning thousands, someone profiting tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan, with no one losing money. So, who is paying for these profits? It is the buyers holding high-priced stocks, hoping for continued gains. Taking a certain company's stock as an example, the face value is 3.5 yuan, and the market price is above 22 yuan. Last year's dividend was 1.2 yuan, and coal production was around 200,000 tons. Every year in July, there is often an irresistible flood, and this year's coal production is said to be three months later than last year. Yet, the market price exceeds the face value by more than seven times. Jardine Matheson and Wheelock & Co. have made huge profits due to the war, one paying a dividend of 5 yuan and the other expected to pay about 10 yuan or more. Now, they are artificially raised to about 8% weekly interest, and the buyers do not consider it expensive. What kind of mentality do these people have? The Union Insurance Company's report states that this year's business is not better than last year's, and the cost of metal materials is high. Cheap inventory will soon be used up, and it is uncertain whether future profits will be substantial. Moreover, the last dividend paid was only 2.5 yuan per share, while the market price is as high as 48 yuan. In addition, public utility stocks have also exceeded the reasonable range. Therefore, it is more worthwhile for Westerners to deposit cash in foreign banks without interest and use it to buy foreign stocks. If you really want to operate in the stock market, you should also choose stable foreign stocks for buying. Otherwise, it is like gambling. I ask, can anyone consistently win in gambling?"

### Food: Smooth and Unimpeded Sources; Rice Market Speculation Loses Its Basis; Dumi is Declining; Foreign Rice is Falling Even More Sharply

The rice market continued its downward trend, with foreign rice having even less of a foothold, plummeting by two yuan. This is because the source of domestic rice has been smooth and unimpeded, with fresh arrivals daily, and Shanghai's inventory has become abundant. Yesterday, another two to three thousand bags of goods from Xichang, Qing Si, and the southern port arrived, with very low selling prices. It is said that the over-the-counter market outside the market continued to depreciate by about one yuan. Although high-grade white rice is no longer as desirable as No. 1 Saigon rice, it is about two yuan cheaper. Changxi Qing rice is only 44 yuan or 43.5 yuan, Su Kun rice is 43 yuan, and Zhong Su is only about 42 yuan. Except for the genuinely special Qingjiao Sijing thin rice, which still needs 45 yuan due to shortage, the medium special is 44 yuan, the general market is 43.6 yuan to 43 yuan, and the high Nan Gang early and late rice is 42.5 yuan, followed by 41.5 yuan and 41 yuan. The price of the bags of rice seen in the market has fallen into the limit plate, selling for 39.5 yuan to 39 yuan, causing general guests to favor domestic rice, and foreign rice is rarely asked about. Moreover, with the price of gold falling and the local prices approaching, those holding goods are particularly panicked. Brokers have changed from guarding to selling, and speculators have lost their basis, and all have left the market. For a time, shouts were frequent, and low prices were repeated, but the sales field was sluggish, and no rice was traded, forming a situation of only outflow and no inflow, and the downstream momentum was like a dyke being breached.

Foreign rice spot goods have seen a sharp decline. The price of 4 or 5-month Two Dog Saigon rice, which was previously 54.1 yuan, was only 53 yuan yesterday morning, and fell to 52 yuan in the afternoon, with a lack of large buyers accepting it. The spot small bag originally sold for 50.3 yuan in the morning, but only 49 yuan in the afternoon. The spot No. 2 sold for 49.3 yuan, a sharp drop of about two yuan compared to the previous day. The price of high-quality foreign rice is only a few angles higher, while the medium and low grades are being sold off at 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan each. In the afternoon, due to the sharp fall in returned goods, the digestion of spot goods was particularly sluggish. Some medium and low-grade goods were sold off at a discount of 4 or 5 jiao, and people's hearts were weak, and the situation was difficult to recover. Moreover, the daily money market was extremely concentrated, and spot interest rates were high. It is reported that the 2,400 tons of West Rice, which was previously blocked in Hong Kong, have already been shipped out. Although most of it is transshipped to the north, the people in the market are all weak in their hearts.

Although glutinous rice is priced low, it is still often asked about, but it is inevitably restricted and followed down by about one yuan.

In short, the decline in rice prices this time was expected. Since domestic rice can flow smoothly and without obstruction, and the warehouse stock is so abundant, it is inevitable. In the past, the price of gold rose sharply, and the exchange rate shrank, making the price of foreign rice inaccessible. The two mutually constrained each other, causing the price to rise instead. Now, the time has passed and the scenery has changed, and the price of rice is trending downward, returning to a state of flatness. We will wait and see.

### Flour and Wheat are Flat and Weak

The market price of No. 2 flour from the flour mill yesterday was still 13.8 yuan. The market environment was not as lively as the previous two days, and the sales to customers were light. The money market was tight, and the rice price fell slightly, which also discouraged the street's appetite. Stockholders rarely patronized, so the returned goods were gradually weakening. The unit price of old-brand flour was 13.74 yuan, and Double Lion brand was 13.434 yuan. The market was generally flat and weak. The total turnover of flour in the city was only six to seven thousand bags.

The current sales of wheat flour are flat. The Chinese mills attach great importance to the eating plate, but the sellers are unwilling to accommodate too much because the arrival and stock of domestic wheat are both scarce. It is said that the Fu and Fu mills sent 500 to 600 bags of goods to the mill, with the highest price being 31 yuan, including 20.078 yuan for Guan goods. The market is mediocre, but there is a rumor that it will drop by a small number of jiao, but the transaction has not yet been finalized.

### Yarn and Cotton: Buying on Dips; Cotton Yarn Not Easy to Loosen in the Short Term

The yarn market continued to rise, and the trend remained tight. However, some of those who had profited from the three consecutive days of gains released their positions, causing the surface to loosen and return to flatness. This situation is a normal phenomenon. However, those with ample general economic resources have firmly absorbed the volume and will not give up, because the spot goods are being emptied.

The spot yarn market opened in the morning with the momentum of the previous day's enthusiasm and continued to rise. The price of 20-count Shuangma factory yarn was 1,470 yuan, but the spot business was not strong, and the market showed signs of weakness. In a short time, it fell by 10 yuan, and the factory price was 1,450 yuan. However, the purchase by low-price households rose again, and the recovery was also rapid. The factory price rose to 1,479 yuan in a single hour. By the close, it was slightly weaker. The total transaction volume in half a day was 1,665 bags, and the spot price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 10 yuan. Today, 270 pieces arrived in Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:

Same trade 1,525 Hong Kong 80

Wenzhou 30 Xiamen 30

Total 1,665

### Silver Market Conditions: US Cotton Sold at a Discount

The bank's transactions are very scarce, but the transactions of Indian and American cotton are more lively. However, they are all intra-industry buying and selling, and the factory's acceptance is very slow. The current cotton transaction situation is listed on the left:

Middling 283.00 Same trade entered 200 pieces

Also 292.50 Also 400 pieces

Dholera 224.75 Also 300 pieces

Xiao Li Port 222.00 Also 204 pieces

Omra 233.00 Also 100 pieces

Dazhongji 251.00 Also 75 bags

South Pacific 213.50 Also 310 bags

Pengjiapu 246.50 Also 100 pieces

In addition, foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, was very firm and lively in the early morning. Later, it rose due to enthusiastic buyers and a partial short covering. The high price of Wall Street had a great impact on the cotton market. As a result, the closing market was firm, and both near and distant futures rose three or four points compared to the previous day. India rose one rupee yesterday, including forecasts.

The foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai Port was slightly quiet due to the extraordinarily tight money market in the city. However, the selling price has always been high. Except for some colleagues who must ship goods in this month due to silver market relations, they can only sell at a discount. It is said that the transaction price of Mi Lin at one time yesterday was 295 yuan, which was very cheap. It is generally expected that the price of cotton will rise sharply in mid-May. The cotton market yesterday, converted into a factory price at a US exchange rate of six yuan, is as follows:

20 Count US Middling 296.50

20 Count Also Lower Grade 287.00

32 Count Also 312.50

32 Count Also Lower Grade 311.40

42 Count Also 315.90

42 Count Also Lower Grade 306.0

### Coal: Coal Briquette Raw Materials Arrive in Shanghai One After Another; Prices May Ease

Hongji No. 2, the raw material for coal briquettes, was affected by the European War in the previous ten days, and shipping was blocked. The black market had shouted a price of 125 yuan, but there was no large-scale supply, so small coal briquette factories had to change to second-class goods for manufacturing. Yesterday, the Manley wheel carried 3,650 tons of Hongji fines, which have arrived at the port and are being unloaded. The second wheel is also about to arrive within days, so people's hearts are gradually stabilized, and the market may fall back.

### Grains: Oil Beans are Both Relaxing

The market conditions for soybeans yesterday were because the gangs were not greedy, and the general speculators were therefore at a loss, and the oil market was also showing a loose trend, so people's hearts turned frustrated, but the high beans were still fixed, and the middle and second beans were quite competitive, so the market has fallen by five or six jiao. A total of only 300 bags of Dingjia Prefecture beans, 250 bags of Anqing beans, 2 cars of Bengbu beans, 150 bags of Xiashi beans, and 150 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow were traded. The prices are all detailed in the market price column.

In addition, 5,639 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday.

### Sugar Market: Many Scattered Sellers; Foreign Sugar Falls Frequently; Only Domestic Qing and Red Rise

The foreign sugar market has recently tightened due to tighter money supply, and most of the loose households have been selling their goods, and the price has turned loose. The guild's pricing, spot 24 coarse white, this store 64 yuan, the new goods outside the store were initially 64 yuan, and then from 3 yuan 8 jiao small to 3 yuan half, and 600 or 700 bags were traded, and the front and rear fell by 8 or 9 jiao. Re-export 50 yuan half, small 5 jiao, Taikoo Chebai slightly loose, B mark West store old goods 71 yuan, and the rest were returned according to the price. H mark Chechi goods 51 yuan, Dutch red slightly small 2 jiao, for 53 yuan 8 jiao, re-export still 45 yuan, this cotton white fell 5 jiao, snow white 63 yuan half, this ice fell by the same amount, No. 1 water 77 yuan, Jingming ice 78 yuan half, domestic sugar Diao Qing continued to open 200 more bags, 52 yuan, and rose half a yuan, Dongxiang red 227 bags, the price rose to 44 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Japan and the US Silk Prices Fall Slightly; This City is Also Depressed

Yokohama raw silk fell by 10 yuan, and forward fell by 2-3 yuan. New York recently fell by 2 points, and forward fell by 4 points. There is no price for spot white silk in New York, but Shanghai silk fell by 3 points.

The silk market in this port, foreign sales are light, and the selling price is declining. The selling price of Jili special silk is 2,600 yuan, which is 75 yuan lower than last week, and the middle dry is 2,075 yuan, which is 25 yuan lower. Only Yuanchang Renchang entered 20-30 tan.

### Green Tea Slightly Sold

Yesterday, Yingzhuang Jinlong, Baochang, Tongfu, Duddell and other firms slightly ordered goods such as core-drawn ordinary treasures and thin needles. The city sold more than 280 boxes, the price of core-drawn treasures was from 300 yuan to 324 yuan, the price of total treasures was 215 yuan, and the price of needles was 76 yuan. The Basque merchants are also in the midst of sporadic negotiations on items such as Gongxi Pearl Tea.

510 pieces of tea waste came from Ningbo yesterday (24th).

### Piece Goods: Summer Woolens are Out of Stock

Yesterday (24th), the woolens market was still good, and gauze, linen, and silk fabrics were stronger than woolens. Summer goods such as white bunting, white straight tribute, feather yarn, fat pick, barathia, manila, twill, saxony, yellow twill, Sanjiang cloth, white canvas, linen glue cloth, white gauze slant, Buddha Yilai, etc., are all lacking, and the market atmosphere is exceptionally brisk. The prices of Dalu board are all expensive, and the actual sales have started, and the zero-wholesale transactions are very prosperous because of this. British-made ordinary white bunting is currently wholesale at 23-24 yuan per yard, DeDa sold at 14 yuan, Feixi goods number one sold at 16.5 yuan, number two sold at 13-14 yuan, good Hua white straight tribute 30 yuan, Lihe 25 yuan, Feixi goods number one 22 yuan, number two 17-18 yuan, feather yarn Central System number one 18 yuan, number two 13-14 yuan, Feixi goods number one 15-16 yuan, number two 11 yuan, Jardine stripe 12.5 yuan, fat pick ordinary Western goods all sold at 14 yuan, Barathia British goods sold at 20 yuan, beam goods number one 18 yuan, number two 10 yuan 0.5 jiao, Manila Western goods number one 21 yuan, number two 19.5 yuan, Dong goods number one 18 yuan, number two 14.5 yuan, screw four British products sold at 25-26 yuan, Jardine Shen woven products 16.5 yuan, shaved cloth British goods 20 yuan, Japanese goods sold at 6.5 to 11 yuan.

### North and South Goods: Hunan Lotus Root Returns

Hunan is recently seeing rare sources, and the production is rising, so the price is changing. Yesterday, 62 bags of Muhu were opened, priced at 182 yuan, up 7-8 yuan. Raozhou has also risen from 135 yuan to 140 yuan.

### Toona sinensis Offers Fresh

The new Toona sinensis from Yanzhou has arrived, and there are zero sales. It was once sold for 120 yuan. Dozens more pieces have arrived and are being sold for 110 yuan. It has been found that this year's production is rarer than the previous one, but the price is high due to transportation difficulties. Those who were engaged in this last year all suffered heavy losses, so they can't help but be a little wary this year.

### Hardware: Green Lead and Iron Trading Still Prosperous

Qing lead and iron are slightly purchased by the thermos bottle factory, canning factory, and printing factory on this street. Yantai and Tianjin gangs also have a slight intention, so the market atmosphere is not lonely, and the shouting price is similar to the previous one. The increase is only one or two yuan. The current market price of Qing lead double-linked iron is 150 yuan per box, and there are also sales of 150 yuan for zero sales. It is found that the total transaction volume in the city is 200 boxes of light.

### US Bar Iron Is Good Again

The US bar iron market was very lively before, but it was once deserted in the middle. However, in the past one or two days, it has improved again. This is because the prices of various goods have been stabilized, and the cigarette company, canning factory, and printing shop often ask about them. In addition, the toy factory also needs a lot, so the market's morale is also vigorous, and the shouting price is good again. Each box of 200 pounds sells for 120 yuan, and 200 boxes were traded yesterday.

### Three Years of Comparative Woolen Goods Market

The market price of woolen goods in this city has been rising sharply since the start of the European War. Although there has been a slight softening recently, the increase is still significant when looking back. The old and new prices of woolen goods are listed below for comparison:

(Note) The above listed market prices for years 26, 27, 28, and 29 are all average prices from the 1st to the 15th of April. The unit is legal tender per yard.

### US Tightens Defenses on Guam to Maintain the Status Quo in the Pacific; Admiral Hart Issues Earnest Remarks; Necessary Measures Will Be Taken if the Philippines Are Invaded

Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, received Western reporters yesterday on the US flagship Augusta. Admiral Hart expressed his full agreement with the idea of establishing defenses on Guam as a naval base. Some people may have doubts about this. Regarding this point, Admiral Hart believes that in order to maintain the original state of Guam, it is necessary to expedite the implementation of defenses, as this is in line with the US policy of maintaining the existing state of the Pacific.

The Situation in the Dutch East Indies Is Unpredictable

The reporter also asked what measures the US Asiatic Fleet would take if the East Indies issue could not be resolved and the Dutch East Indies were about to be invaded, and whether a plan had been drawn up to deal with future emergencies. Admiral Hart smiled and did not answer, but after being pressed three times, he said, "It is difficult to predict at the moment. I am not willing to make predictions."

Many US Warships Concentrated in Shanghai

Regarding the general policy of the US Navy, Hart was also unwilling to disclose it, but he indicated that the US Navy would definitely take appropriate measures in the near future. He will write a special article to discuss this matter. He also said that since the flagship Augusta sailed to Shanghai, many US warships have been concentrated in Shanghai. In the near future, several more will sail to Shanghai from the Philippines, and some will sail to North China. He added that the current war in the Scandinavian Peninsula would definitely not affect the US Asiatic Fleet, but if the war invaded Philippine territorial waters, the US Navy would naturally take necessary measures.

Restrictions on the Pearl River Have Not Been Lifted

When discussing the opening of the Pearl River, the Admiral said that although it is said that the Pearl River is open, the various restrictions imposed by the Japanese army have not been lifted, and restrictions are still imposed on the passage of foreign warships. Regarding this point, he stated that he was unwilling to express any opinions before conducting an inspection, but he pointed out that the trade between the United States and South China, such as Guangzhou, is still optimistic in the current situation.

Filipinos' Views on Independence

Regarding the issue of Philippine independence, the Admiral stated that the opinions of Filipinos on this issue can be divided into two types. Although the general Filipino deeply loves President Quezon, they also deeply fear that once the Philippines declares independence and is separated from the protection of the United States, it will encounter unexpected crises. Others believe that independence is not risky and express doubts about the aforementioned unfounded worries. As for the farmers in the Philippines, he believes that they have received sufficient self-government training from an early age. He also said that the only coastal defense line of the Philippines is Manila Bay. From a military perspective, he believes that fixed defenses are not sufficient to guarantee defense, as the area is too large and cannot be accomplished without the power of the Navy.

Inspections of Officers and Soldiers Today and Tomorrow

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, has scheduled the 25th and 26th to inspect the work and barracks of the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, as is customary. The procedure will be to inspect the entire regiment at the Racecourse at 9:00 AM on the 25th, and then inspect the various barracks and officers' offices. On the morning of the 26th, he will inspect the regiment's exercises. During Admiral Hart's inspection, officers from the headquarters will accompany him to investigate various activities of the Marine Corps.

Commissioner to the Philippines to Host a Banquet Tomorrow Evening

US Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre and his wife, arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd aboard the US Asiatic Fleet flagship Augusta. They met with Admiral Hart, who had arrived earlier in Shanghai, on the same day. It is now confirmed that Mr. Sayre has scheduled to host a banquet for Admiral Hart and other important US officials in Shanghai, such as Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, and Attorney General Heermick, Acting US Consul General Batterick, at the Cathay Hotel at 8 PM tomorrow. It is reported that Mr. Sayre will depart for Japan on the 28th to visit Ambassador Grew. It is said that the purpose of his trip is to strengthen the ties between the US government and its foreign envoys, so it is widely believed that Mr. Sayre's reception with the Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet and other important officials in Shanghai is also of great significance.

### Native Banks' Internal Market Conference Today to Rush Through Fourth Quarter Settlements

With the fourth quarter settlement period approaching, the Native Banks Association has scheduled an internal market conference for 2:00 PM today to handle and decide on various deposits and loans for the fourth quarter period. Factories and firms in the domestic goods business, as well as old customers with good credit, will have their long-term credit loans that are due rolled over, with interest rates set separately, ranging from 8% to 1.5%. It is said that the amount is approximately 10 to 20 million yuan. As for long-term credit loans, the number of transactions is not large, with more transactions related to tea and silk. This is because tea and silk will soon be on the market, and these two industries need funds to go to various production areas to purchase goods. Other loans are few, because native banks, in order to prevent fueling speculation, are following the orders of the Ministry of Finance and are particularly cautious about all loans, especially long-term credit loans. Unless there is sufficient reason to prove that it is a legitimate need, they will not easily release funds. Therefore, the financial market in Shanghai is becoming tighter, but it remains stable, and there is no problem in safely passing the fourth quarter period.

### Strict British Inspection of Ships; Delays in Mail and Goods; Transfer via Russia Is Faster; Overseas Chinese Suffer Great Hardships After the Outbreak of the European War; Shandong Merchants Return to Their Home Country via France and Italy

Most of our overseas Chinese compatriots are engaged in the shipping industry. It is said that in order to blockade Germany's foreign trade, the United Kingdom is conducting extremely strict inspections of "wartime contraband" on ships traveling to and from the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Foreign ships traveling from Asia, Africa, and the Americas to Europe must first anchor at the Downs, south of the Thames Estuary in England, and wait for inspection when passing through the English Channel. The entire crew is trapped and delayed, often for several weeks.

The Downs Is Extremely Convenient for Ships to Stop

The Downs is located west of 2 degrees east longitude, north of 51 degrees north latitude, northeast of Dover, the English port city, protected by Goodwin Sands to the east and blocked by the English coast to the west, making it extremely convenient for ships to stop. Foreign ships entering the Downs are guided by lights and buoys, and other signs indicate the mooring location. In addition, the sea area directly east to the French territorial waters is heavily mined. There is no other way to navigate the sea between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.

Audits and Inspections Take a Long Time

To prevent excessive delays, foreign ships can first send all the documents for their goods to London and ask the competent authority to review them in detail. However, if any suspicious points are found regarding the unloading location or the direction of transport, once the case is transferred to the British Economic Warfare Department for review by the competent authority, it will cause even longer delays. Therefore, the exchange of sea mail between Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and the delivery of postal parcels by waterway during this period of the European War, must be delayed by at least one month. The mail traffic between Hong Kong and Europe is not as convenient as sending it from Shanghai westward via Russia.

Chinese Merchants Return to Their Home Country with Their Families

The Shandong merchants who have been transporting domestic products to Europe have been leaving Europe with their families and discontinuing their businesses. Chinese expatriates departing from Europe mostly travel by train to France or Italy to avoid the obstacles of the British customs at the Downs, and then buy a boat and sail the ocean from the Mediterranean coast. This is a special state of maritime transport since September 1939, and it is something that our domestic merchants and travelers should thoroughly understand.

Decrease in Ships and Stagnation of Mail

According to news from the Directorate General of Posts, in recent months, due to the decrease in shipping lines, the transport of mail is inevitably slightly more stagnant than before. The latest batch of mail from Shanghai to Europe will be loaded onto the SS Conte Rosso on May 12, traveling to Europe via the Suez Canal. On June 3, a batch will be loaded onto the Hakone Maru to be transported to Europe. As for the latest incoming European mail, there is a batch of mail sealed in Europe on April 12, transported to Shanghai on the Conte Rosso.

### Labor-Management Conditions for Public Buses Officially Announced Yesterday; Full Text Passed and Accepted by the Board of Directors; Official Announcement Implemented and Employees Are Satisfied

The employees of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company in this city's machinery department, ticket sales department, and coppersmith workshop went on strike in late February to demand improved treatment. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, together with the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department and Mr. Shao Xubai, served as mediators, and a solution was finally negotiated and declared a complete success. According to a report from the Dagong News Agency, the terms of the settlement negotiated between labor and management have been passed and accepted by the company's board of directors. Yesterday, the director, Mr. Shaw, officially announced the implementation in writing. The original text of the announcement of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company is recorded below: (1) The following is the agreement resolved by both parties on March 4, 1940, which is hereby announced on the left:

Increased Allowances

(2) From March 1, 1940, the existing living allowance of 10% added to the net salary will be increased to 30%. (3) After the abolition of the existing rice allowance, each employee can purchase half a picul of Saigon rice No. 1 for a price of 15 yuan in national currency per month. (4) The various measures implemented for new employees since November 1, 1936, as stated in the professional creed, have been revised. From January 1 of this year, all new and old long-term employees will be entitled to an annual bonus at the end of the year, which is 5% of the total monthly salary earned each year. (5) At the same time, to express mutual goodwill, all new employees who joined the company after November 1, 1936, can retain (without having to return) the 15 yuan in national currency per person prepaid before the lunar new year last year, i.e., February 8 of this year.

Preferential Measures

(6) To further reconcile mutual feelings, salaries will be paid as usual during the strike period. (7) Medical expenses for employees injured due to the strike incident will be paid by the company, but must be certified by the company's doctor as unrelated. (8) The company further agrees that the average daily working hours of each employee shall not exceed 8 hours. (9) To the extent possible, temporary workers in the car factory may be converted to permanent employees after six months of service, except for temporary workers hired to manufacture new car bodies. (10) After the resolution of this incident, the company sincerely hopes that all employees will embrace a spirit of cooperation and continue the harmonious feelings of the past, assist the company, eliminate bad habits, and improve service efficiency day by day. This announcement is made by Director Shaw Talbot White in [Month] of the 29th year.

### Ma Shaoquan Goes to Hong Kong for Recuperation

Mr. Ma Shaoquan, a prominent figure in Shanghai's business community, was ambushed on the 28th of last month while traveling from his residence to his company. He sustained six gunshot wounds, and one of his bodyguards was also severely injured. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital for treatment and fortunately survived. However, Mr. Ma's friends in Hong Kong and Ningbo, including Chen Qinshi, Luo Qinghua, Shou Yicheng, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaoji, and Zhu Meixian, sent telegrams from Hong Kong to Shanghai to express their concern. They suggested that although Mr. Ma's condition was gradually improving, staying in Shanghai for recuperation might still be risky. They all urged him to recuperate elsewhere. Mr. Du and Mr. Wang also took advantage of Mr. Jin Jianxiang's trip from Hong Kong to Shanghai and specifically instructed him to visit Mr. Ma at his residence to comfort and strongly urge him to travel to Hong Kong together. Mr. Ma, unable to refuse their friendship and considering the dangerous environment in Shanghai, left for Hong Kong with Mr. Jin on the 17th of this month to recuperate in a safer location.

### British Deserter Arrested

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," British soldier Xisang, from the West Fork Highland Team, who escaped from the British military prison on Difeng Road on the 7th of this month, was arrested on the morning of the 24th and returned to prison. He will be charged with desertion under British military law.

### The Eventful Month of May is Approaching: Authorities Take Necessary Precautions, Hoping to Avoid Creating Unnecessary Tension, Aiming to Maintain Safety and Order

The month of May, with its numerous commemorative days, is approaching. Authorities in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession have begun to make necessary preparations to maintain safety and order in both concessions. Sources reveal that security measures will be heightened during the four days of May 1st, May 3rd, May 5th, and May 30th. The police department has prepared the necessary police force. At that time, troops stationed from various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will be mobilized. Barbed wire will be set up at the border between the two concessions, and pedestrians will be checked to prevent any potential incidents. Yesterday, authoritative sources stated that although the authorities do not want to create an atmosphere of unnecessary tension, the safety and order of the two concessions must be maintained. May 5th marks the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as the Extraordinary President. According to a previous agreement, Chinese residents can freely display the national flag to commemorate the occasion.

### Far East Norwegian Merchant Ships Officially Announce Resumption of Voyages: Norwegian Ambassador to the UK Negotiates with British Authorities, Shipping Routes Also Designated by the British Admiralty

After the outbreak of the European war, trade for both Denmark and Norway was severely affected. Ships travelling to the Far East have been ordered to concentrate in Hong Kong and await further instructions, the suspension lasting almost ten days. Concerning the fate of Norwegian ships, the Taipan of the Norwegian company, Hualun Shipping, has been in discussion with the Norwegian Consulate-General in Shanghai every day of last week. By the end of last week, there was a glimmer of hope, but since further instructions were needed from Hong Kong, no announcements were made. However, news of the resumption of voyages was reported yesterday.

All Detained Ships Have Been Released

According to shipping industry sources, the resumption of voyages for Norwegian ships in the Far East was negotiated between the Norwegian Ambassador in London and the British authorities and was officially announced on the 22nd. Besides following British and French wartime shipping rules, the shipping routes were reportedly designated by the British Admiralty. The "Mimei" of Hualun Shipping, previously carrying American flour and heading to Tianjin, was detained by the British Navy in Hong Kong while loading coal due to the Norwegian incident. Yesterday morning, the company received a telegram from the ship stating that it had been released and was sailing directly from Hong Kong to Tianjin that morning.

Resumption of Danish Ship Voyages May be Impossible

The Norwegian ship "Jalisman," managed by Tianxiang Shipping, carrying cargo from the US to Shanghai, was forced to return to Hong Kong after encountering a British warship in the high seas on the morning of last Friday (the 19th). The two Norwegian ships "Titania" and "Jiranna," scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th, were also detained when passing through Hong Kong. Yesterday afternoon, Tianxiang Shipping in Shanghai also received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that the three Norwegian ships had departed for Shanghai and were expected to arrive in port this Friday (the 26th). There has been no activity from the Danish ships in Hong Kong, and their resumption of voyages may be impossible.

### Residents of Extra-Settlement Roads are Willing to Pay Taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council; the Tax Bureau Has Also Issued Notices for Collection; Attempts by the Puppet Regime to Extort Residents Door-to-Door are Ineffective

The issue of police authority on the extra-settlement roads in West Shanghai was compromised on February 16th of this year when Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan reached an interim agreement. The detailed rules are currently being discussed by Mr. Bowen, Commissioner of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the puppet "Police Chief" Lu Ying, as well as Japanese advisors. According to sources close to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the agreement between the two parties regarding the extra-settlement roads in West Shanghai only pertains to police authority matters and does not involve financial matters such as taxes. The Shanghai Municipal Council has made substantial investments in the area and has no intention of relinquishing control. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council will continue to collect the summer property tax and other taxes in the area, and the Tax Bureau has issued notices for collection. Foreign residents of the extra-settlement roads are also willing to pay taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council. However, the puppet regime is coveting the taxes in the area and has dispatched personnel from the puppet Finance Bureau to extort residents door-to-door, which is quite strange.

### Anti-Mopping-Up Campaign to be Launched in Songhu War Zone: Three Chinese Divisions Reach Destination

The Qinghu Road area of the Songhu war zone was previously a guerrilla stronghold. Recently, the county magistrate Lu led the bandit troops of Xu Leisheng to defect to the puppet regime. They were reorganized into the 16th Army of the Peace Preservation Army under the command of Gu Fusheng, who was heavily attacked and severely damaged. He requested assistance from the Japanese military. The Japanese military did not hesitate to mobilize Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Zhabei and the counties of Qingsong and Shangjia, using Xu's troops, who were familiar with the terrain, as guides, forming a large encirclement. They used heavy weapons such as flat-trajectory guns and tanks, covered by swarms of Japanese aircraft, to launch a fierce siege. Gu's troops calmly resisted for three days and nights. The Japanese and puppet troops trembled with fear and indiscriminately looted and killed, regardless of soldiers or civilians. The villages were burned to ashes. Fortunately, Gu's troops bravely attacked and held out for nearly a week. After receiving approval for reinforcements, they temporarily withdrew from the encirclement to a safe area to regroup due to the disparity in numbers. In total, the Japanese army with more than 4,000 troops failed to win and suffered more than 300 casualties. The Chinese army initially had more than 300 troops and fought while increasing their numbers, suffering only more than 30 casualties. Now the troop strength has increased to more than 700 people, seizing more than 200 light and heavy weapons, and also a lot of other military supplies. This is truly a feat in the history of the Songhu guerrilla warfare. The Chinese authorities, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered Gu Zhutong, commander of the war zone, to dispatch the 60x60x two divisions stationed on the Hangjia Road for close-range support. They also transferred the 100 Ganx division, a crack central force, to assist day and night. It is now reported that the vanguard infantry has arrived at the destination and has established close contact with the newly formed 3x division of the New Fourth Army stationed in the border area. According to a military authority, the number of troops joining the battle in the Songhu area is now at least 5,000, and these troops all have sophisticated weapons and are well-equipped. Other reinforcements are also arriving in an endless stream. Soon, a large-scale anti-mopping-up campaign will be launched in the Songhu guerrilla area.

### Fourth Period of Low-Priced Briquettes to be Sold Tomorrow

The fourth round of low-priced briquette sales by the Shanghai Machine-Made Briquette Industry Association will commence on the 26th of this month and last until May 5th. The regulations stipulate that each person can still purchase 5.5 jin of briquettes for 0.30 yuan (Chinese currency) per day. The sales time is still from 2:00 PM every day until sold out. A total of 32 locations have been set up in the two concessions, including 18 locations in the International Settlement and 14 locations in the French Concession. The above-mentioned low-priced briquettes are all supplied by the Gongyong, Nanyang, Yitaixing, Guohua, Huacheng Cuiji, Yuanfeng, Yuanhua, Guanghua, Yuedong, Jinghua, and Dongfang, eleven briquette factories. They have also sent letters to the police authorities of the two concessions requesting them to send police to protect the sales.

### Jianshe Dredger to Sail to Songhu for Dredging of Shentan: All Preparations are Complete, Fire was Started Yesterday

Since being forced to reorganize, the Dredging Bureau has gradually been preparing to carry out dredging work. The Bureau's giant, world-class "Jianshe" dredger has been idle since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Incident, moored off the Bund in the French Concession for more than 33 months. Yesterday, coal ships were mooring around the vessel to discharge coal, and smoke was coming from the funnels. After the coal is unloaded, it will set sail for Shentan outside Wusongkou to continue dredging. At present, all the dredging machinery and tools on board have been installed, and the crew and workers boarded the ship a month ago to prepare to start work. In addition, the sister ship "Fuxing" is still moored in Danzig. This vessel was originally ordered by the Dredging Bureau from Germany. When construction was completed, the Shanghai Incident occurred, so it was temporarily moored in the Danzig shipyard, and its voyage to Shanghai was suspended. Now, due to the outbreak of war in Europe and unrest at sea, it has not yet been able to sail. It will not be able to leave Danzig until after the end of the European war.

### Son of British Expatriate in Shanghai Dies in Battle in France: British Air Ministry Telegraphes Family

It is reported that Peter, the son of Mr. Lianxi, a well-known British expatriate in Shanghai, died in action on the 21st of this month while flying a plane at the front line. This has been confirmed by a telegram from the British Air Ministry to his parents. Peter was only 19 years old and joined the Royal Air Force in September last year to participate in combat. He was an outstanding combatant and was awarded a medal. His time in France was very brief. His parents have lived in Shanghai for more than 20 years.

### Contributing Cures to Relieve Victims of Zhongshan Disaster: Li Ze Delivers Speech

The Shanghai All-Circles Relief Association for the Victims of the Zhongshan Disaster held a three-day charity fundraising broadcast at the New Capital Hotel's glass radio station, which was very successful. Due to the severity of the disaster, in order to encourage fellow citizens to actively participate in the fundraising campaign, Mr. Li Ze, vice chairman of the association, delivered a speech yesterday, offering cures, stating: "The Relief Association for the Victims of Zhongshan Disaster was organized after the first fall of Zhongshan County last year. Unexpectedly, Zhongshan County suffered a second fall while we were starting to raise funds. This battle came suddenly, and the loss of food at this time of spring plowing is indescribable. Therefore, the colleagues decided to invite the Yongan Leshe troupe to perform for free. We also received support from ten celebrities in Shanghai, inviting musicians, ladies, celebrities, broadcasting experts, and famous opera singers to perform for free. The total amount of donations was around 50,000 yuan (Chinese currency). The population of Zhongshan County totals over 1 million. According to my personal estimate, at least 50,000 poor people urgently need assistance. The various donations, performances, and broadcasts collected by the association this time amount to no more than 10,000 yuan, which is far from the amount needed to help the victims. Therefore, I believe that we must start with a widespread fundraising campaign and promote a long-term plan to support the victims. In terms of widespread fundraising, there are at least 50,000 to 60,000 people from Zhongshan in Shanghai. If each person can raise 10 yuan for themselves or find a way to raise funds on behalf of others, we will have 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Furthermore, if all the people in Shanghai participate in promoting fundraising, the amount will naturally be even greater. I hope that everyone will rise up and work together to support this cause."

### Ruilun Ship Arrives from Ningbo, Stern Damaged, Enters Dock

The British Ruilun ship, managed by Hualun Shipping, arrived at Wusongkou at 1 AM yesterday morning (last night). At that time, it was high tide and the wind was very strong. Moving like an arrow, it sailed straight into Wusongkou. At the location of the first lighthouse at the entrance, there is a stone barrier used by the former Dredging Bureau to block the rapid currents of the Yangtze River from entering. When the Ruilun ship entered the harbor last night, the helmsman saw that the bow of the ship was heading straight towards the stone barrier and quickly turned the rudder, causing the bow to swerve to the left. However, the stern was unable to avoid the barrier, and the bottom of the ship rubbed against the stone barrier, causing a small hole to form in the right side of the third hold of the stern. Seawater immediately flooded in. After learning of this, the ship's owner ordered the use of three pumps to remove the water that had flooded into the hold. Although the ship suffered minor damage, it did not affect its sailing, so it continued to move forward along the Huangpu River and arrived at the Bund Park Pier on Beijing Road at around 2 AM, where it docked. The goods in the third hold were slightly damp. The company has decided to start salvaging operations today. The ship was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Ningbo today, but the schedule has been changed, and it will enter the dock for repairs. Regarding the tickets that have been sold, the company posted a notice yesterday stating that refunds would be allowed, and tickets could be exchanged for tickets on the Deping ship. As a result, the Deping ship was delayed until 3 PM today before leaving the port and sailing to Zhenhai.

### Important News Roundup

Individual packages from Wuji and its subordinate Beisuzhen and Donghoufang sub-bureaus in the Beiping area are temporarily suspended from acceptance. Individual packages sent to the Jingxing Mining Bureau can now be accepted. Individual and medicine packages from Rongqi and Gujing sub-bureaus under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Bureau can now be accepted.

More than 2,000 rickshaw pullers in the Nanshi area launched a general strike due to the increase in rental fees by the owners, causing a labor dispute. Only on the 23rd did they decide to modestly increase the rental fee by 5 cents per day. All the rickshaw pullers, forced by their livelihood, had to reluctantly resume work at 1 PM in the afternoon.

Vessels sailing directly to Ningbo often find themselves unable to exit due to the shallow water during low tide and have to stay overnight in Zhenhai. Fearing that goods and passengers may secretly board or disembark at night, it has been ordered that all vessels should wait for the tide before setting sail.

### Elementary School Students Pick Up Diamond, Sell it Privately, Commit Crime: Diamond Worth 4,000 Yuan, Police Prosecute for Embezzlement

Ding Guanghong, a Suzhou native residing at No. 37, Lane 70, Xipushi Road, is 23 years old. His brother and classmate Yin Yi (13 years old) are both elementary school students. At 11 AM on the 20th, they were driving back and forth on a bicycle at the intersection of Pushi Road and Saporse Road, playing. At that time, a young Russian woman was passing by in a rickshaw. While sitting in the rickshaw, she took off her gloves, accidentally causing the diamond ring on her finger to fall to the ground. Ding and Yin, two elementary school students, spotted it and picked it up. The diamond was worth 20,000 yuan. Ding took it back to Ding Guanghong, who took it to a pawnshop for appraisal. The pawnbroker estimated the value at 2,000 yuan, but a shop guarantor was required for the transaction to be completed. Ding was unable to provide a guarantor. Later, Ding sold the diamond to a jewelry store in the Jing'an Commercial Center for 4,000 yuan. The store paid 2,000 yuan in cash and a check for 2,000 yuan with a one-month term. Later, Yin Yi's family was dissatisfied because they did not receive a share of the money and reported the information to the French police for investigation. After discovering the loss at home, the owner also reported to the police to investigate and arrest the suspects. Upon receiving the report, the police head dispatched Detective Kang Hui to arrest and detain Ding Guanghong and recovered the stolen goods. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special Court. Judge Qiu interrogated them. The police lawyer stated that the defendant was under investigation for embezzling lost property and requested a postponement. The defendant, Ding Guanghong, admitted that his brother picked up the diamond and sold it and hired a lawyer for defense. The hearing was adjourned to the morning of the 27th, and the defendant was released on bail. The stolen goods were returned to the original owner.

### Truth About the Murder on the Japanese Ship Hakone Maru: Japanese Sailor Murders for Money

A Chinese man named Rong Zengxiang was found murdered in cabin 114 on the Japanese ship Hakone Maru around 11 PM on the 22nd. His body was covered in wounds, and a hemp rope was tied around his neck. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the case occurred, the police concentrated on the lower-ranking crew members of the ship to start the investigation while inspecting the ship. An examination of the deceased's wounds revealed that he had been beaten to death by the murderer with an iron bar. Then, they discovered that the door to cabin 116 next to the room where the incident occurred was tightly closed. They knocked on the door, but there was no response for a long time, which aroused strong suspicion. They immediately broke down the door and found a Japanese sailor named Tejima Kaneo (22 years old) from Yokohama inside. They also found clothes covered in bloodstains and arrested Tejima. He confessed after a question and admitted that he had lured the deceased into the room and beaten him to death. He also said that the hemp rope on his body was used to tie him up after death and intended to throw him into the Huangpu River to destroy the evidence. It is also reported that 300 yuan of cash belonging to the deceased was found in the murderer's room.

### Civilian Women and Children's Hospital Benefits Civilians: Free Delivery

The Civilian Women and Children's Hospital has been in operation for two years. It was originally established for refugee mothers, but now that the refugees have dispersed, it has been transformed into a service for civilian mothers and infants in Shanghai. Inpatient delivery is free of charge. All working women and maids can go to No. 737 Weihaiwei Road to request a physical examination and be admitted to the hospital for delivery.

### Venereal Disease Harms the Body, Mixed Medicines Mislead People

Venereal disease is regarded as a shameful disease by everyone. In fact, it does not necessarily come from unclean sexual intercourse. There are many other routes of transmission, so those who are wrongly accused suffer no less pain than the physical pain they experience. Therefore, the sooner the treatment, the better.

From the pathology of venereal disease, it is best to treat it in its early stages because the virus is still shallow and easy to deal with. However, most patients are afraid to speak out because they are ashamed and secretly choose their own medicines. Patients are not all knowledgeable in medicine, so how can they start? Famous medicine "161" Jun Fa Ke Xing is a bacterial antitoxin preparation. After taking it, the medicine directly reaches the affected area and can effectively kill bacteria. Its diuretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, detumescence, bactericidal, and cleansing powers are incomparable to ordinary old-fashioned preparations. Moreover, after recovery, the test is non-toxic and can still reproduce normally. A free test coupon is included in each box to ensure credibility and guarantee. It is truly a special and effective holy medicine for secret self-treatment. Each box costs four yuan. Mild cases can see results with one box, and severe cases can be cured with two boxes. The general store of Chinese and Western pharmacies, as well as major pharmacies such as Jihuatang and various fire companies, all sell it. Produced by Shanghai Yuanhua Pharmaceutical Factory and managed by Minghua Trading Company.

### Reverse Ethics of Parricide Case - Appeal Debate Concludes - Sentencing Set for the 30th of This Month

The parricide and reverse ethics case that shocked the nation, the first trial verdict, the unfilial son Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, jointly murdered their direct lineal ascendant relative, each sentenced to death. Their mother, Zhou Jing, was sentenced to two years and six months for assisting in destroying the corpse. Because the defendants disagreed with the verdict, they hired lawyers Ting Yanglinzhi, Ye Shaoying, and Yang Sicheng. Zhou Jing hired lawyers Jiang Panfan and Jiang Baozhou to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. They argued that the appellants all suffered from hereditary mental illnesses and expressed dissatisfaction with the forensic鑑定 report, requesting another鉴定 from a different institution. This newspaper has already covered all of these developments. Yesterday afternoon, another court hearing was held, the second such 合 court hearing, at the First Special Court, Jiang Road Criminal Court.

The courtroom was extremely crowded with men and women listening to the trial. Before 2:00 PM, the courtroom was full. The female protagonist, Zhou Qinzhu, dressed in a blue cheongsam, covered with a green short coat, and white leather shoes, appeared calm. She sat silently in the audience with relatives. All the Chinese and Western judicial police of the special court were dispatched and distributed inside and outside the courtroom. Anyone without an audience ticket was denied entry. At 2:30 PM, the lawyer of the patrol room, Gan Jingxian, and the appellants' lawyers, Ye Shaoying, Yang Sicheng, and Jiang Pingfan, arrived on time. Presiding Judge Nie Chongyi, along with Judges Shi Meiyu and Jia Zhensheng, and Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, took their seats. First, appellant Zhou Qinxiang was briefly questioned. Then, witness Gui Ren Yang, a native of Wujiang, testified that he was thirty years old. He had been employed by the Zhou family since June of last year until after the incident when Miss Zhou (i.e., Zhou Qinzhu) dismissed him. While working at the Zhou family, in addition to cleaning the rooms, he also helped the wife (Zhou Jing) cook. His bedroom was in the pavilion room upstairs, far from the deceased's bedroom, so he could not hear any conversations, etc. He did not know why the old master (Zhou Yongjie) was killed. The wife usually came downstairs at 10:00 AM because she suffered from heart disease, so she stayed in the kitchen all day until 10:00 PM when she went upstairs. That evening, he went to bed at 10:00 PM and got up at 5:00 AM the next morning. He did not see the old master. According to Xiao A'guan (Zhou Qinji), his father had gone out in the middle of the night.

He did not know anything else. At this point, Judge Nie ruled on the appellant's claim for an appraisal in full, saying, "The application is rejected." And because the facts were clear, he ordered the debate to begin. First, the Public Works Bureau's agent lawyer, Gan Jingxian, said, "Upon investigation, the evidence regarding the appellants Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang's involvement in the murder and destruction of the corpse is solid. The circumstances of the crime and the facts are consistent. The patrol room has thoroughly investigated the shops where the appellants purchased the items. The items were jointly purchased by the two appellants, which is clear evidence and leaves no doubt. As for the age issue, during the appeal hearing, they suddenly reduced their ages by three years. I don't know what the purpose is. It should be known that the criminal law clearly stipulates that anyone under the age of eighteen does not apply to the crime of killing a direct ascendant relative. As for the claim of mental illness, it has also been

medically proven that they are no different from ordinary people and are not in a state of mental impairment. The motive for their crime is not limited to abuse of their mother. Because the deceased had some property, the appellants stole banknotes and money after the deceased's death, implying a case of murder for money. According to the crime of robbery and murder, they should also be sentenced to death. Moreover, the circumstances of this case are serious, killing a direct ascendant relative and dismembering the corpse, intending to destroy the corpse and eliminate the evidence. This is outrageous and infuriating. Since the establishment of this court, this case is unprecedented and the circumstances are abominable. Our country has always valued etiquette and ethics. This giant case of reverse ethics, using scientific new methods to kill with electricity, is unforgivable in terms of law and human sentiment. As for Zhou Jing's part, the original trial sentenced her to two years and six months for assisting in the destruction of the corpse, which is already an act of leniency, reducing the sentence by one degree. The appeal should be rejected and the original verdict upheld." Then, appellant's lawyer Ye Shaoying said, regarding the part of appellant Zhou Qinji, the original trial's determination of the facts was based on (1) Zhou Qinji's confession, (2) the statement of co-defendant Zhou Qinxiang. The confession was not a directly questioned and recorded statement, and its nature clearly does not comply with the provisions of Article 270 of the Criminal Law. Upon investigation, at the opening of the appeal trial, Zhou Qinji consistently denied that he had participated in the murder, while his brother Zhou Qinxiang directly admitted that the case was his own doing. The patrol room cannot prove that Qinji had any complicity, and he should be declared innocent. As for Zhou Qin’s

confession, he admitted to the criminal facts, but regarding whether he has a mental illness, according to the last paragraph of the forensic report, it states that he has a low-grade mental illness. This lawyer requests another鉴定 which was not approved. Therefore, regarding the criminal facts, although he did not legally reduce his sentence, etc." Then, appellant's lawyer Yang Sicheng continued the debate, saying, "There are as many as thirty-five types of crimes listed in the criminal law. According to criminal statistics, although murder cases are not the least, they are not the most either. Killing a direct ascendant relative is especially rare. The reason is that human love is greater than that for parents and children because children are the spiritual sustenance and material successors of their parents, with only happiness and no conflicts of interest. Therefore, society can be indifferent to killing an ordinary person, but killing a direct ascendant relative is considered

a world-shattering event. This attitude fully expresses the good ethical spirit of filial piety first for thousands of years. Furthermore, according to legal regulations, killing an ordinary person and a direct ascendant relative are both murder crimes, but the punishments are different. Especially the age of the crime, Article 63 of the Criminal Law stipulates that anyone under the age of sixteen who commits a crime shall not be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, but this restriction does not apply to killing a direct ascendant relative. It can be seen that legislation values filial piety. However, the current criminal law does not adopt absolute death penalty for killing a direct ascendant relative like the old criminal law, but still has life imprisonment as an optional sentence. Article 57 of the Criminal Law stipulates that the motive, purpose, character, living conditions, and knowledge level of the offender must be

taken into consideration. On the surface, the appellant killed the victim in this case, but in fact, the result of this case was caused not by the appellant, but by the victim. Moreover, the victim's death was not a killing, but a death from illness. If you ask what kind of illness, (1) mental illness, (2) a bad marriage illness. Regarding whether the deceased had mental illness, it can be observed from his pre-mortem treatment of people and things. Moreover, in previous trials, the appellants' testimonies and the previous testimony of witness Chen Renmei all stated that the deceased had a bad temper, ignoring the crowd, and the relationship between husband and wife and father and son was as cold as ice. These are all symptoms of mental illness. As for the bad marriage, it is well known to relatives and friends that appellant Zhou Jing had a bad relationship with the deceased, often beating and scolding him. When in Fengda, the man had a mistress. Appellant Zhou Qinji, etc., stated that Zhou Jing had heart disease and wanted to drink porridge, but the deceased insisted that she eat rice. Zhou Jing wanted to close the window because of illness, but the deceased insisted on opening the window.

Such things are endless. After twenty years of marriage, there has never been a good feeling. Now everyone hates the appellant's cruel and despicable methods, and the original trial's death sentence is perfectly appropriate. But if we still have human sympathy, we must also say something fair. They were created by the two illnesses of the deceased, the victims of a cold family, not the destroyers. Because everyone in the world has desires, and their minimum desire is to achieve survival satisfaction. Now the appellant's family has encountered coldness and has a terrible father, living in hell with no joy, and the mother is also abused, and there is a great possibility of not being able to survive. In order to save their mother, they did not hesitate to take improper measures, creating the motive for this case,

and a reduced sentence should be considered," etc. Then, Zhou Jing's defense lawyer, Jiang Pingfan, argued that the original trial sentenced her for assisting in the destruction of the corpse, and the important evidence adopted was a foreign terrace key found by her side. When the patrol room detectives went to knock on the door, the appellants Zhou Qinji, etc., came downstairs to open the door. At that time, the foreign terrace door was not locked at all, and Zhou Jing was arrested in the kitchen downstairs, and there was no assistance in destroying the corpse. She should be declared innocent," etc. Judge Nie核供 announced the end of the debate in this case, and the judgment will be announced at 2:00 PM on the 30th of this month. The appellants were still detained separately.

### Social Miscellany

### Letter

To the Editor:

According to the statement of the person concerned, Chen Zhaoxi, "Upon reading the report in Shenbao regarding Chen Zhaoxi's bigamy and fraud, the content is inconsistent with the facts. Chen Zhaoxi's marriage to Wang Meng took place after his divorce from Jin Suhua, so there is no bigamy. As for whether there is fraud or adultery, there are facts and laws to be revealed. However, this case has not yet been judged, and it is biased to adopt only one side of the story for dissemination, which is indeed confusing to the audience. Please send a letter on my behalf to request a correction," etc. Based on this, we are sending this letter to you for correction. Lawyer Wang Liwu, April 24.

### Re-copying Old Newspapers - Sixty-Seven Years Ago (365)

(From this newspaper in the twelfth year of Tongzhi in the late Qing Dynasty)

Grain from Grass

In Shijiaowei, Qingyuan Prefecture, there are several hills, covered with grass from the foot to the top, with almost no empty space. Last month, each blade of grass in the hills grew a string of grain, no different from rice. It was harvested and cooked, and its sweet and fragrant taste was the same as rice. The villagers there spread the news of this strange phenomenon, and everyone far and wide knew about it, and those who went to harvest it were constantly on the road. Later, when the authorities became aware of it, fearing that the people would compete for harvesting and cause disputes, they immediately sealed it off, hired people to harvest all of it, and the resulting grass grain, three or four thousand catties, was all stored in the official granary.

Strange Events in Huizhou

In Jiazibu, Huizhou Prefecture, Guangdong, it was heard that on the 28th and 29th of last month, fishermen caught more than five hundred fish heads in their nets. Although there were no bodies or tails, some were connected to intestines and stomachs, as if they had been cut with a knife. However, they were not rotten. At first, the fishermen were startled and threw them into the water. Later, because they were readily available, they took them to the market to show the public. Some brave people cooked and ate them, and there were no other problems. It was also heard that in Hudong, thirty miles away from Jiazibu, fishermen also caught more than one thousand four hundred fish heads in their nets. Also, last year, in a certain night there, the land suddenly became bright, and the residents saw the sunrise, and it soon fell, and was followed by angry lightning.

Thief on Maple River

A certain farming family in Fengxi, Wu, had a lot of money. Recently, there have been repeated thefts. Therefore, they hired three or four people to take turns guarding the night. Before the fourth watch the other day, they heard a rustling sound on the eaves. They rose up to pursue and capture, and saw a person jumping down into the courtyard. He was less than three feet tall, wearing printed cloth padded trousers, and was a child of ten or more years. The crowd raised their hands to grab his sleeves, but he knocked them open and fell several feet away. When they tried to go forward again, the child had already crouched down and jumped onto the roof and disappeared.

### Doctors Who Benefit Humanity

— Zhou Wu

The progress of modern medicine has reduced the suffering of patients and has allowed for the use of various preventive methods to prevent the spread of diseases. Diseases that could not be cured before can now be treated with new methods, allowing the sick to recover. This is a great blessing for modern humans. It is the medical researchers who diligently work in the laboratory, the doctors who selflessly save the world and serve humanity, and the nurses who provide this happiness to mankind.

We should be most admiring, respectful, and grateful to these people. The gradual reduction in the mortality rate in civilized cities and the annual decrease in the number of people suffering from diseases are all the results of their efforts.

Occasionally, we see the life stories of these individuals in biographies or other books, and their awe-inspiring will and spirit are enough to make us yearn for them for a long time and remember them for life. Not long ago, two films were shown in Shanghai, bringing the facts of the lifelong struggles of two doctors to the screen, and I was deeply moved after watching them. These two films are: "The Citadel" and "Glorious Memories."

Of these two, the latter made a deeper impression on me. This doctor worked hard for decades, dedicated to serving the poor, not greedy for profit, not caring about slander, and doing what he believed was right. His compassionate love and perseverance were enough to "illuminate the four corners of the earth" and be immortalized forever.

Looking back at our country, not to mention the backwardness of medical skills, this spirit is almost "one in a million." Of course, there are also many doctors abroad who only seek profit, hang up their signs, set prices, and wait for patients who can afford the consultation fee to come for treatment, rather than automatically running around to serve patients. But why not compare and compete with these great doctors?

In modern society, the best doctors are not just those with high medical skills and complete equipment, but those with compassionate and loving hearts who are willing to serve others. They are always concerned about the health of the public and give the greatest happiness to modern humans.

Abroad, many cities and towns now have public hospitals or private hospitals dedicated to benefiting the poor. Most doctors with high medical skills also volunteer to work in hospitals, preferring to earn less themselves, but they are much happier in spirit because many strangers thank them and bless them behind their backs.

Although there are a few such hospitals in China, they are too few in comparison. What's more, our people's physical constitution is not as good as foreigners, and the rate of disease is several times higher than theirs, so it is far from sufficient.

Once, I stumbled in school, broke the skin on my hand, bled, and the wound had some dirt. Because I was far from home and had classes at school, I was afraid that if I waited too long, germs would get in and cause inflammation, so I ran to a nearby medical clinic to ask the doctor to wash it and apply some medicine. This procedure would only take two minutes and the cost of the medicine would only be two cents, but they insisted on charging me a medical fee of $1.20. As a result, I preferred it to become inflamed rather than wash it. Later, it turned out well and did not become inflamed.

This experience made me even more aware of the greatness of the old doctor in "Glorious Memories."

Originally, serving humanity is a doctor's duty, but now, doctors who serve humanity are considered to be the best doctors.

However, doctors who only seek profit will be eliminated, just like the "imperial physicians" of the past.

### Cause of Death

— Po Linshan

According to American statistics, the following nine conditions account for 72% of the leading causes of death in Americans:

(1) Heart disease.

(2) Common cold and pneumonia.

(3) Anthrax and malignant tumors.

(4) Kidney inflammation.

(5) Cerebral hemorrhage and softening of the brain.

(6) Pulmonary tuberculosis.

(7) Children born with deformities, or infected with germs shortly after birth.

(8) Being crushed by a car, or encountering other accidents.

(9) Diabetes.

Among them, heart disease, which occupies the top spot, is indeed a very terrible executioner for mankind. In 1937, 346,401 Americans died from heart disease. About 33.9% of people around the age of sixty die from heart disease. Its threat to boys aged ten to fourteen is only rivaled by item eight and enteritis.

Science

### Toads Contribute to the World

— Fangren

Whenever the word toad is mentioned, who wouldn't shake their head and frown, immediately thinking of its ugly appearance. But it is this object of ridicule that can sacrifice its life to add a layer of protection to human life. Because the medical community has recently discovered that the poison it secretes can treat cancer, and it has been successfully tested.

About a year ago, French doctor Ke Nailiu published his experimental results, saying that the poison secreted by a gland under the toad's chin can help the human body to resist pain. But at that time, most people were unwilling to believe it and did not pay attention to it. It was not until recently that the Institute of Immunity admitted that Dr. Ke Nailiu's experimental results were indeed true. Originally, the institute's research on resisting cancer had been carried out by researcher Pei Long twelve years ago. However, because no factual basis had yet been obtained, it has always remained silent.

Pei Long's research began by examining whether animals also develop cancer. After a long period of experimentation, he found that snakes also develop this disease, and after examining four thousand vipers (a type of poisonous snake), not a single one had even the mildest form of cancer. In addition, he examined three thousand toads and one thousand eight hundred frogs. As a result, dozens of frogs suffered from this disease, while toads, like vipers, did not suffer from this disease. Based on the above-mentioned experiments, Pei Neng believes that the venom of frogs, snakes, and toads is indeed a good medicine for resisting cancer. Furthermore, because the effectiveness of the latter's secretion is even greater, he decided to use it exclusively to try to develop an antitoxin for treating cancer.

The preparation of the test has now been completed, so the institute also published the results, which are consistent with Dr. Ke Nailiu's experiments. It is said that this injection made from toad venom can not only treat various cancers, but also has the effects of strengthening the heart, maintaining the balance of the nervous system, and stimulating glands.

The Chinese medical community had already discovered that toad venom can be used in medicine. According to the Ci Yuan and Ci Hai, its name is "Chanshu". And the method of making it is transcribed from the Ben Cao as follows: "There are different methods for obtaining Chanshu. One method is to pinch its brow ridge with your hand to extract the white juice; another method is to put spicy things such as garlic and pepper into its mouth, and the toad's body will naturally produce white juice from its eyes. Scrape it off with a bamboo spatula, mix it with flour to form a block and dry it, which can be used in medicine." But it does not say what diseases it mainly treats. Later, the author asked someone to ask a state-owned enterprise, and according to his report, "Chanshu is not used in prescriptions, but is often used in pills and powders, such as those for warding off plague. Therefore, it is an adjuvant, with many effects, but it is not used alone."

However, regardless of whether the Chinese medical community was the first to discover it, as far as the author knows, it is probably just the prototype of the initial invention and has not been further studied. Now that others have studied it more clearly and intelligently, let them catch up from behind. However, in the future, the author hopes that domestic professional researchers will also pay attention to Chinese medicine. If they can find a clue like "Chanshu" and then improve it, wouldn't it be more meaningful and valuable than picking up other people's wisdom and only seeking to make money?

Education

### Nude Infant Education

— Qing

In recent years, the world's educational theories have not only made significant progress, but also, due to the advancement of human civilization and the development of scientific life, many educational methods that were previously considered bold and fanciful are now able to be put to the test.

The nude kindergarten in London is adopting this educational theory to allow innocent and lively children to break down the ambiguity surrounding the human body and use the natural environment—sunlight, air, water—to provide them with a completely healthy and happy life education.

This nude kindergarten completely takes "freedom and health" as its main educational goal. Although their curriculum standards are not much different from those of infant education in other countries around the world, their educational methods are very novel. They do not have rigid class schedules or textbooks. Students are free to choose the books they like as knowledge textbooks.

Apart from a certain order in daily life, diet, and daily activities, other aspects of life are very free. After each student enters the school, they can choose an educational toy that they love. Whether they play with this toy alone or in a group, it is up to their own freedom. The teacher's task is only to be responsible for taking care of them. However, at the appropriate time, they will instill life knowledge and learning into them anytime, anywhere, so that they receive a good education without realizing it.

According to experts' research, the greatest advantage of this type of education is that it not only improves children's physical strength and skin resistance, but also has great benefits in terms of intelligence.

At the same time, children's sensitivity is particularly strong. If they are given a frank and bright concept of the human body before elementary school age, it can break down the ambiguous psychology they might have towards the human body in the future.

### Book Hospital

— De Gang

In Rome, there is a unique hospital in the world. The patients who patronize it are all books and documents. If any valuable ancient books or documents suffer from diseases such as breakage, mildew, stains, or worm damage, they only need to be sent to the hospital, where pathology experts will be responsible for treatment. The treatment procedure generally involves disinfecting them first, and then conducting a detailed diagnosis of each page and part. If any stains or injuries are found, they will be removed with medicines or surgery. After the treatment is completed, they will be elegantly bound and escorted out of the hospital, and it can be guaranteed that there will be no risk of re-infection for a certain period of time.

### God Above All (1)

— Anonymous

The world today is a madhouse, full of noise, instability, and meaningless clamor. Modern life is so complex and so hurried that most people are swept forward by the tide of everyday affairs, hardly knowing why. People desperately seek pleasure, blindly chase the crowd, and make whimsical sacrifices. A family is no longer his palace; radio broadcasts intrude into his residence, reporting everything in the world, from business to jokes in bed, filling the home with everything. Therefore, one of the most difficult things to do in the world today is to have a small, quiet room. Life is moving at high speed, people only think about the headlines in the newspapers, and are controlled by their nerves or techniques, and there is simply no time to think, and not from their own opinions, to reach some kind of rational conclusion. Because of this clutter, confusion, hurry, and lack of clear and broad thinking, modern life is too focused on material values. We are so foolish as to believe that the most obvious sign of good people is how much property they have or how much money they have in the bank. Many inventions and massive production have caused too many goods to pile up in front of us, so that we often regard a person's wealth as a sign of his success. As critics say, "Salesmen say that the success of family life depends on buying a new car every spring, and they also tell us that labor-saving inventions will surely make us happy, and fashionable clothes can make up for the lack of character. All you need is new furniture to decorate your home into a satisfactory home." Such advertisements will surely make people feel that if they have sufficient material possessions, they will be infinitely happy. In this noisy chaos, we take the thoughts of the crowd as our own, forget our own self-confidence, and generally accept the ideal of judging people's success or failure by their property. Who would have thought that just as this concept was gaining momentum, we would suffer the greatest economic depression in history, banks collapsed, the stock market crashed, and the material structure was destroyed. Then, the old religious saying, "A man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions," once again shone the light of truth on the world. Following this economic depression, we also see a kind of spiritual depression, which is; people deceive themselves, to convince themselves, that comfortable methods can make life great, and comfortable methods can make life noble. Having money is more important than earning it by one's own efforts, and entertainment is higher than respect and virtue. People do not believe in each other, do not believe in anyone's character, and also doubt the value of their own social system.

### Kissing and Beards

— Yong

Max Factor likes to collect all kinds of interesting questions in Hollywood. Recently, he asked the beauties in the film city such a question: When you need to kiss on the silver screen, do you prefer someone with a beard or without? Here are their various answers:

Carole Lombard said: "I don't object at all to kissing male stars with beards; because my husband is one." (Note by the author: Carole Lombard's husband is Clark Gable.)

Rosalind Russell said: "I absolutely don't want to kiss people with beards, especially on the screen, and especially those with fake beards."

Binnie Barnes said: "The question of kissing and beards doesn't matter to me. But there is one thing that I have in common with Rosalind, and that is that I also hate kissing a star with a fake beard."

Ginger Rogers said: "Whether for artistic reasons or for work reasons, I would never want to kiss someone with a stiff and prickly beard."

Ann Sheridan said: "From the perspective of pure art, I think it is a humiliating job to kiss someone with a beard, whether it is Hitler-style or Chaplin-style."

Bette Davis did not express any opinion on this question, but she told Max: "Because I have a very ticklish upper lip, so, when I encounter things like beards, it often makes me emit a kind of ruthless smile; for this reason, the director always prevents me from kissing male stars with beards."

According to Max's final investigation, there is only one actress in Hollywood who really likes to kiss general movie stars with beards, and that is Steffi Duna.

### After Listening to "The Pearl Mark"

— Ji

A few days ago, Huang Guiqiu posted "The Pearl Mark", and there was also Yan Shishan's "Xiangjiang Meeting" in the front court, which is a rare good play. I went to see it, but the Xiangjiang Meeting had already come to an end, which was a pity.

The play "The Pearl Mark" is adapted from the old play "The Shepherd's Scroll", and was revised by Cheng Yanqiu, adding a beginning and an end. This play also stars the male lead Zhu Chundeng, so bearded actors such as Tan Fuying also perform this play. On this day, Zhu Chundeng was played by two actors. The first half was played by Song Yuchun. There is nothing good to say about the first half.

Huang Guiqiu's Zhao Jintang places equal emphasis on singing and acting. After the reverse clapper "Sigh, my husband lost his life, tears filled my cheeks", there is still a sentence of "Jiong Long", and after "Jiong Long" is "Crying Head", but on this day, as soon as Guiqiu's reverse clapper was finished, the "Crying Head" actually started on the stage. Fortunately, Guiqiu was alert and quickly hinted at the stage, so that Jiong Long could pass. Otherwise, I would have to smash it. Then he sang the original clapper, and the four characters "Life to the Yangtai", Guiqiu used a tune like the one in Lanfang's "Phoenix Returns to the Nest" which was extremely beautiful. After that, every phrase and tune was wonderful. After this section was sung, it was the "Song Family Forcing Marriage" scene. The person playing the Song family was a new member of the cast, and I don't know their last name. When beating Jintang, there were three phrases of rocking clapper, and what the stage was playing was Xipi, but the performers sang Erhuang loudly. The old female singer who sang the fourth phrase sang Xipi again, making the singing unclear. Liu Zhenting, who played the old female role, was also quite competent. After this scene, Zhu Chundeng was victorious and ennobled. Da Yuan took the stage, performing very hard, and his voice was also very good. In the crying scene, there was a large section of reverse Erhuang, and he was able to cope with it well, and there were many good tunes. The phrase "What official are you doing" was raised in pitch, and there was a wonderful high-pitched singing that reached the clouds. The scene later became "Sacrificing to the Tower", which was one of the most exciting sections of the whole play. In this scene, in addition to the male and female leads, the old female singer, the painted face, and the small painted face were all quite important. After Guiqiu finished singing the reverse clapper sentence "Zhao Jintang kneels on the mat, tears streaming down his face", she sang a slow phrase, and in the sentence "Listen carefully to my description of my home", the two words "Listen carefully" used a high pitch, which was quite good. In the fourth sentence, "My father, Zhao Dutang, is a high-ranking official", she sang with full color. In the sentence "Married to my son-in-law, Zhu Chundeng", after the two words "Zhu Chundeng" were sung, the deputy net who played the flag bearer should have come on stage, tripped Zhao Jintang, and drawn his sword, showing many beautiful gestures (Hou Xirui and Yanqiu were a perfect match for this role). However, Liu Yanting, who played the flag bearer on this day, passed by indifferently, reducing a lot of excitement. In this scene, in addition to the male and female leads and the old female singer, Guan Shengji, who played the small painted face, received full applause for reciting the tongue-twister "The old ones go in, the young ones don't go in". His dialogue and acting were also good. Then he sang the original clapper sentence "Married to my son-in-law, Zhu Chundeng, a marriage of hair", and the four words "A marriage of hair" were another beautiful tune. However, in the sentence "It is written on it that my son-in-law died in battle", Guiqiu used a double tune for the four words "Died in battle", which was the same tune as the four words "Life to the Yangtai" in the first original clapper, which was not appropriate. After Guiqiu finished singing this section, Da Yuan still had a section of original clapper, which was a place for the old male singer to please the audience. The second sentence, "It's like a knife stabbing meat and piercing the heart", was bound to be good, because the old male singers who played this role would surely receive applause when singing this sentence. However, Da Yuan on this day dragged out the two words "Heart Piercing" in this sentence, so he failed to receive applause. This is not to say that Da Yuan was not good, although Da Yuan only had a few scenes, he was not inferior to Guiqiu. I was extremely satisfied after watching it, so I wrote this down in a rambling way.

### Cathay Film Company to be Established on June 1

— Hai Xing

According to a certain gentleman close to Zhou Xuan, he told the reporter that Zhou's Cathay Film Company is scheduled to be officially established on June 1. At that time, the two major studios of Guohua should be completed, and Cathay will use the consumer cooperative method to shoot plays in Guohua's new studio. However, the first play has not yet been decided. However, what I can tell the readers is that the plays that Cathay wants to shoot, whether they are historical or modern, must have considerable significance in the script, and will not focus 100% on business considerations.

In terms of personnel, in addition to moderately borrowing a portion of the supporting roles from Guohua, other arrangements will be made independently. The hope is to put together a lineup that can refresh the audience's eyes and ears. It is said that Bai Yang and Gao Zhanfei, who the Shanghai audience has been longing for for a long time, may join Cathay. Bai and Gao were old colleagues when Zhou was in charge of Mingxing, and the two sides have a good relationship. If there are no unexpected obstacles, joining should not be a problem. As for when they will leave Chongqing and come to Shanghai to star in what play, this magazine will be the first to report to the readers. Some time ago, there were rumors that Bai Yang had secretly come to Shanghai, which was completely untrue. As for Jin Suqin's "Wenji Returns to Han", it is also listed as one of Cathay's productions, but it is not the main force for the opening shot.

### "Two Worlds"

— Jing

The China Travel Troupe's "New Meiluo Fragrance" was originally scheduled to be performed for one week, but due to its sustained box office success, it was extended to more than ten days. The audience still demanded an extension, but the protagonist Tang Huaiqiu was already setting up a memorial service for his father, so he couldn't perform anymore. It was decided to present the three-act play "Two Worlds" from last night according to the original plan. This play is a work by a first-class domestic writer. When it was performed in the mainland, it caused a sensation. It is a vivid satire on the life and attitude of unscrupulous merchants. The main actors are Sun Jinglu, Lin Na, and Huang He, etc. The director Li Ping also plays a leading role.

### Sun Jinglu, the female lead in the China Travel Troupe's satirical comedy "Two Worlds", has performed in plays such as "Sunrise", "The Last Regret of the Ming Dynasty", and "Thunderstorm".
