It is also claimed that China is about to join the Axis powers and that China and Japan will participate in the war against Britain in the Far East. Chinese officials have stated that these rumors are groundless and that Germany has not put forward any peace proposals. Furthermore, there is no official information to confirm the alleged Japanese withdrawal from South China and the Yangtze River basin. (5th Reuters dispatch)

### Chiang Kai-shek's Closing Remarks to the Sichuan-Xikang Economic Construction Committee; Encouraging the Committee with Three Matters

Chengdu: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's closing remarks to the Sichuan-Xikang Economic Construction Committee were read by Zhang Qun. The text briefly stated that this meeting brought together many talents, and the discussions were thorough. All the proposals are concrete and practical, which is deeply admirable. Since the publication of the Sichuan-Xikang Economic Construction Outline, more than five months have passed. The central government's expectations of this committee are very high, and society's expectations of this committee are even more earnest. After this meeting, we should express our good ideas together and form a plan. We must be able to promote and organize the various facilities and organization of agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, transportation, and finance in Sichuan and Xikang provinces in a practical and effective manner. The construction of our national revolutionary base will truly begin from now on. The resources of Sichuan and Xikang provinces are extremely abundant, and the human and material resources and social capital are also very abundant. If we can effectively manage and coordinate our efforts, and shift floating capital to production and turn useless things into useful ones, the inland can immediately achieve prosperity, and the people can share happiness and benefits together. I would like to offer three matters to encourage each other. First, judging from the current situation in Sichuan and Xikang, construction must be based on establishing local security and transforming social customs as prerequisites for the Economic Construction Department. Therefore, the two major policies of suppressing bandits and prohibiting opium must be fully implemented by local governments, and social leaders must unanimously support them. We must aim to develop the people's strength, invigorate their will, strictly enforce order, and purify long-standing habits. Only when society has a positive and vigorous spirit can all construction be promoted in an orderly manner. Second, another prerequisite for economic construction is to seek convenient transportation. The central government will not only do its best to promote modern transportation construction but will also refer to the good rules of the past and promote the implementation of the postal transportation system. The governments and societies of our Sichuan and Xikang provinces must, under the overall plan, call on the people at any time and in any place, and make step-by-step efforts to organize and develop water and land transportation. The scale does not have to be large, but it must be persistent, so that production results can be smoothly circulated, and then economic construction can flourish. Third, there have been many discussions on economic construction in the past, but often the plans were beautiful, but the actual results were not abundant, and the beginnings were grand, but they could not be continued halfway through. After the establishment of this committee, we should first strive to correct the mistakes of the past. All administrative expenses and agency expenses should be reduced as much as possible, and the funds used for undertakings must also be used to the fullest extent, using one penny as two pennies, to maximize the effectiveness of public and private funds. There are norms to follow in the achievements of material construction in modern countries, not to mention that our country is in a difficult war, and we cannot afford to waste resources and waste resources. Therefore, all the undertakings promoted and sponsored by this committee must strictly guard against the ills of turning past undertakings into bureaucratic agencies and wash away the shame of the fact that our country's construction undertakings have achieved nothing for decades. This is especially important for all participants to recognize. As the saying goes, "Be cautious in the end as in the beginning," and "To climb high, start from the bottom; to travel far, start from the near." Be precise and practical to lay the foundation for our rear area construction. This is not only the fortune of Sichuan and Xikang provinces, but the future of the country and the nation depends on it. (5th dispatch)

Editorial

### Examination of the Balkan Dispute

Italy's invasion of Greece, and Greece's resolute resistance, led to the outbreak of the Balkan War. This happened at 5:30 AM on the 28th of last month. The military strength of the two countries is vastly different; but until today, the black-shirted warriors of Italy, who claim to be responsible for restoring the glorious tradition of the ancient Roman Empire, are still far away, blocked outside their target. The final outcome of the Greek-Italian war almost awaits the final decision of the global situation: and now we can speculate as follows: (1) If Mussolini's strategic goal in launching the military invasion of Greece was to quickly seize the military ports of Crete, and Salonica, so as to threaten the flank of the Central Empire and cover his advance into the Near East and Africa; then Mr. Mo's gamble has failed due to the loyal self-defense of the Greek soldiers. Because the Greek army resisted for ten days, Britain had already obtained sufficient time to take action first. (2) Also, if the intention of this move by Germany and Italy was to save their increasingly declining prestige in view of the failure of the air offensive against Britain; that is, to stimulate domestic morale with a new victory of outward expansion; then Greece, fighting the great with the small, and with great arrogance, is also giving the invaders a considerable blow. (3) Furthermore, if Germany and Italy regarded this as a touchstone for building the so-called "New European Order," thinking that after Greece was conquered in one fell swoop, all the remaining weak European countries would be frightened by it, and from then on, they would all kneel before the "New Order," then this plan has also received a negative answer; because Greece's resistance has given all countries that are unwilling to be slaves to foreign forces a great indication and encouragement, so that some countries that are hovering between the two paths of autonomy and submission, such as Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, know what to choose. This is the result that Greece's heroic resistance in the past ten days has already created.

Let us try to spy on the future: First, examining the military strength of the two sides, the maximum number of the German army is probably around eight million people, and recently, in the area bordering Hungary and the Czech Republic, as well as the Danube River Basin, the German troops concentrated for standby are said to have reached about one million. The maximum number of the Italian army, as Mussolini has repeatedly boasted, is also "in the millions"; but according to more accurate estimates, it can reach at most about six million, and now the number used to attack Greece is said to be only 20,000. In the current situation where there are no large-scale battles in Western Europe, if Germany and Italy decide on a strategy to join forces and move east, then in terms of land forces, Greece, with an area of ​​130,000 square miles and a population of 6.3 million, cannot resist alone. Therefore, purely from the perspective of the fundamental national strength of Germany, Italy, and Greece, there is no need to deny that Greece absolutely cannot maintain support for a long time. Second, the war in the past ten days has been roughly divided into three battle lines: (1) At the northernmost point, the base of the Italian army's attack is Korça in Albania, and the goal is to seize the Greek military port of Salonica; in this regard, the Italian army seems to have invaded Greek territory, but judging from the telegrams, the progress is very slow. (2) In the central part, Greece has launched a heroic counterattack, and it is said that it has invaded the territory of Albania, inflicting considerable damage on the Italian army. (3) In the southernmost part, the Italian army has made the greatest progress, and its target is the Greek capital Athens: there is currently fierce fighting taking place on the Kalamas River. In addition, the Italian air force has also bombed various parts of Greece. Based on the war situation of these ten days, it may take Italy quite some time to conquer Greece. However, we must of course recognize clearly that the truly large-scale war has not yet begun. Germany and Italy now seem to be waiting for Greece to change its mind and surrender; once compromise is hopeless and a large-scale war begins, the war situation will probably not drag on like this for long.

Second, before this European war, the so-called "Balkan Alliance" included four countries: Turkey, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Greece. The troops they can mobilize can probably reach six million people; until the eve of the outbreak of the war, except for Yugoslavia, which had already wavered, Turkey and Britain had signed a mutual assistance agreement, and both Greece and Romania received security guarantees from Britain. In fact, Britain hoped that as soon as the war began, a strong front could be formed in this area to start a war against Germany; but this plan of Britain's finally failed due to three factors: (1) The failure of negotiations between Britain and Romania at that time, Romania refused to participate in aiding Poland. (2) The Soviet Union opposed Turkey's participation in the European war for the benefit of Britain and France. (3) Italy's failure to immediately join the war suppressed the brewing of any hostile action against Germany in this area. By June of this year, after France collapsed, Romania was also controlled by Germany and Italy. Now, if Greece also succumbs, then Yugoslavia's embrace of Germany and Italy is inevitable; as for Bulgaria, which has always been inclined to the Axis countries, needless to say, it will inevitably follow in the footsteps of Hungary and become the vanguard of Germany and Italy's eastward advance. Therefore, from the British point of view, Greece's resistance at least gives Britain an opportunity to maneuver, so that Germany and Italy cannot temporarily complete their attempt to incorporate the entire Balkans (except Turkey) into their own war machine; that is, Greece has given Britain a final opportunity to win the friendship and assistance of the Balkan countries. The crux of the matter after this is whether Britain can still win the friendship of the Balkan countries and form a strong front to resist Germany and Italy's eastward advance?

The answer to this serious question is not necessarily certain, but it is possible. There are two points that can be used as evidence: First, Britain's determination this time is strong, and its aid to Greece is rapid and practical; second, the attitudes of the Balkan countries have gradually changed in the past few days. The collapse of the "Balkan Alliance" in the past should mostly be attributed to Britain's shilly-shallying appeasement policy. Under the pressure of Germany and Italy, small and weak countries have no reliable external assistance, so apart from surrendering and seeking temporary peace, there is really no other way. Now, according to British Navy Secretary Alexander, Britain has indeed made significant efforts for the final periphery of its empire's Near East African part, and troops are being transported to Greece; the impression this gives to small and weak countries is exciting and comforting enough. Under this encouragement, they see Albania on one side and Greece on the other, with different paths of survival and different views of honor and disgrace, which will make Turkey, Yugoslavia, and other countries, if at all possible, surely fight hard for their own survival. In short, the depressed atmosphere of ten days ago has now obviously seen a boost, and Turkey has even gathered a large number of reservists. If the trend is such and the general situation is not decided, the biggest key to whether Britain can finally achieve regaining the friendship of the Balkan countries and reversing the entire situation is by no means a matter that can be achieved by diplomacy and lip service; it still depends on Britain proving its aspirations to share hardships together and taking immediate action!

### Unprecedented Enthusiasm Across the United States: Voting for New President; Final Results Imminent; Roosevelt Confident of Victory

Washington – From the skyscraper-laden cities to the remote and impoverished 126,000 electoral districts, between 50 million and 55 million American voters have gathered this morning at polling places to make a decision in the most important presidential election in history. Will the American people, due to the urgent international situation, break precedent and elect Roosevelt for a third term, or, based on Willkie's advocacy of "unity" to restore the foundation of prosperity, will they adhere to the 150-year tradition and elect Willkie? This question is now the main point of debate among Americans. Judging by the current state of the Roosevelt and Willkie campaigns and the arguments they have put forth, the difference in votes between the two sides may not be significant. Therefore, the outcome of this grand competition, a spectacle unseen in recent world history, is still uncertain. Both Roosevelt and Willkie were still competing for votes after midnight on Monday. This morning, both sides believe they can secure victory, as they have made their final appeals to millions of undecided voters. President Roosevelt has concluded his Democratic campaign after completing his national broadcast and speaking tour and has returned to Hyde Park. Willkie, on the other hand, has made numerous speeches in New York City, urging women to support his "non-war" promises. The final results of the election, Shanghai time from 1 p.m. to midnight, will be revealed soon. Seasoned Western politicians are perplexed. Weather will be an important factor in the election. Many believe that good weather will favor Willkie, as he is expected to receive a large number of rural votes, and rural votes are more affected by the weather than urban votes. Other unpredictable factors include: first, the record number of registered voters who could sway the vote; second, the women's vote, which is heavily influenced by the war issue; and third, the division of a large number of labor votes. John L. Lewis, the leader of the powerful Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), supports Willkie, but many groups within the CIO oppose his actions and have expressed their willingness to vote for Roosevelt. The division within the CIO is largely due to this. (International News Service, 5th)

New York – Polling in New York City is scheduled to close at 9 p.m. tonight. There is great concern about the voting situation in New York State, as it has a particularly significant impact. This morning, those gambling on the outcome of the election predicted the odds of Roosevelt and Willkie winning at five to four, which was later changed to six to five, indicating that while Roosevelt's chances of being elected were slightly higher in the eyes of the general public, no definitive conclusion could yet be drawn. (Haitong Telegram, 5th)

New York – On the final day of the U.S. presidential election, experts suggest that the chances of victory are extremely slim, and weather will be a major factor in President Roosevelt's chances of winning. It is believed that if it rains, it will favor Roosevelt, as Willkie's supporters in the West will not go out due to the rain, while Roosevelt's supporters are mostly in urban areas and will not be affected by the rain. Polling places in New York opened at 6 a.m. this morning and will close at 9 p.m. tonight, but the provisional final results will not be available until noon tomorrow. (Haitong Telegram, 5th)

Washington – As the presidential campaign drew to a close yesterday, various parties issued appeals to voters. Roosevelt and Willkie also made final appeals. Secretary of State Hull stated that the United States needs Roosevelt's continued leadership, while John L. Lewis, leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), urged voters to elect Willkie, claiming that foreign agents in the United States are assuring their nationals that the United States will soon join the war if Roosevelt is re-elected. President Roosevelt broadcast from his home in New York, stating that he awaits with complete trust the verdict that will confirm the righteousness of the principles for which he has campaigned. (Reuters, 5th)

### Roosevelt Makes Final Appeal: Urges National Unity

At the end of his speech, the President appealed to the nation, urging the people to unite and reiterating his hope to avoid involving the United States in war. The President stated that he has great confidence in the outcome of today's election and that the election result will maintain the principles of the New Deal. The President also stated that today's election in the United States will give the United States a "true administrator" and will give the people the traditional freedom of speech to the government, so that free nations may forever be free. He said, "After the votes are tallied tomorrow, the United States will remain united. Americans should thank God that the United States is not currently embroiled in the vortex of war. We hope, under the peaceful and enlightened leadership of heaven, to continue our peaceful lives." (United Press, 5th)

Poughkeepsie, New York – President Roosevelt delivered his final pre-election speech here last night, stating that he believes that the German and Italian people will eventually restore their traditional freedoms and align themselves with self-governing systems based on free elections, as in other parts of the world. Although overseas events may seem far away, distances have now been greatly shortened, so it is necessary to understand that domestic peace depends on a clearly understood capacity for self-defense. (Reuters, 5th)

Washington – U.S. Secretary of State Hull reported last night that when President Roosevelt made his final broadcast speech, he requested that all citizens of the country remain united, regardless of the outcome of the election. Roosevelt's final campaign speech was broadcast from his private residence in Hyde Park last night. Roosevelt reiterated that if he is re-elected, he will not allow the United States to become embroiled in the vortex of war. (International News Service, 5th)

### Willkie Broadcasts to Women: Vows Never to Lead America into War

New York – Republican presidential candidate Willkie broadcast a speech to American women on the eve of the election, pledging that if he is elected, he will never let their husbands and sons die on the battlefields of Europe and Asia, and that all his actions as president will be to maintain America's peace and stay out of war. "Unless your congressional representatives vote for war, I will never lead America into war." (Reuters, 5th)

New York – Willkie's campaign organizers here stated that, according to the results of this morning's primary elections, Republican candidate Willkie has already swept eight states in the Midwest.

### Preliminary Voting Surveys Show: Roughly Equal Strength Between the Two Sides

Washington – The U.S. presidential election has become a matter of great international importance. On the eve of the election, private voting surveys have revealed a result of roughly equal strength between the two sides, with gains and losses yet to be foreseen. However, members of both parties expect that their supported candidate will win. Republican newspapers stated that Farley, the director of the New York Democratic Party, has not issued the usual notification of confidence in the party leader, but only sent a telegram stating the importance of all eligible voters casting their ballots. This is considered to be very significant. People in Washington, however, believe that although Roosevelt's bid for a third term faces strong opposition, it may ultimately be realized. The American people have rarely attached such importance to a presidential election. Gatherings and careful deliberations are being held everywhere. One of the biggest features of this election campaign is that both candidates are speaking on war and diplomacy. Roosevelt's promise to aid Britain and his remarks attacking Nazism and communism have been well-received, while Willkie, in recent speeches, has also made promises to aid Britain even more than Roosevelt has done. However, the Republican Party's isolationist tendencies remain a major obstacle for Willkie. (Reuters, 4th)

New York – U.S. newspapers yesterday used the presidential election as a topic for discussion, stating that no election since President Wilson's election in 1916 has been so public.

### Economic Negotiations Between Japan and the Dutch East Indies Stall: Dutch East Indies Government Issues Statement Rejecting Interference from Third Countries

Batavia – According to a government statement last night, trade negotiations with Japan have not yet yielded results, but may continue.

### American Passenger Plane Crashes Near Salt Lake City

Salt Lake City – An American United Airlines passenger plane crashed and was destroyed yesterday in the area north of here, killing ten people. The wreckage was discovered at an altitude of 7,000 feet near a small village named "丰饶" [Fēngráo, but it seems like a typo and could be intended to mean "丰饶" Fēngráo, which translates to "Bountiful"]. The plane was flying from Elko, Nevada, to this city at 3:40 a.m., carrying seven passengers and three crew members. It encountered a severe blizzard en route. The pilot made every effort to locate the Salt Lake City airport but crashed. Previously, the pilot had radioed that the plane he was flying was eighteen miles north of Salt Lake City and was gradually descending to land. It is now believed that the pilot was unable to see anything in the severe blizzard and was unaware of the large mountain nearby, causing him to descend in an area that was too far north. Since 1934, this is the fourth major passenger plane to crash in the mountains near here. (United Press, 5th)

### Greek Troops Attack in Two Directions; Korytsa Expected to Fall Soon; Penetrate Several Miles into Albanian Territory; Italian Communiqué Claims Occupation of Kalibaki

Aulona, Yugoslavia - News from here states that Greek troops yesterday launched a two-pronged attack on Korytsa. The first route was along the main road to Bilishta, and the second was along the southeast coast of Lesser Prespa Lake. The Greek forces used mechanized units of light tanks for this new offensive. These mechanized units came from the northeast and have crossed into Albanian territory along the road connecting to Bilishta. After this new attack was launched, Greek troops have now occupied the Albanian villages of Noruk, Shaqradet, and Deren. Greek troops occupied these villages after defeating a unit of Italian troops, capturing 180 Italian vehicles, including eight Italian officers. With reinforcements arriving in the Korçë area, the strength of the Greek army is even greater than at the start of the war. The Italian army is now using mortars and light mountain guns to counterattack, and has also moved reinforcements from Pogradec to the southwest corner of Lake Ohrid opposite Korytsa. It is also reported that the Greek troops advancing along the Korytsa road advanced another kilometer yesterday. (United Press, 5th)

National Capital - The main Italian stronghold on the northern front, Korytsa, is likely to fall imminently. The area is already controlled by Greek artillery fire.

On Artificial Sex and the Necessary Maintenance of the Male Body

Modern science has truly made rapid advances, and almost any difficult problem can be solved by science. The great achievements in the field of natural science are indeed too numerous to mention, and the research on human reproductive glands in the field of physiology alone is astonishing! Steinach devoted his life to arduous experiments on human reproductive glands. As a result, he perfected the use of animal reproductive gland extracts to supplement the human body, achieving the effects of curing diseases, prolonging life, and rejuvenating. This shocked the medical world and benefited human health. His great achievements can truly shine as brightly as the sun and moon. However, regarding research on reproductive glands, there have recently been great achievements in the artificial creation of sex. According to Dr. William O. Puckett of the United States, who demonstrated his method of artificial sex at the American Zoological Society, he dissected the reproductive glands of very young frog tadpoles for public examination, pointing out that the sex of tadpoles in this early stage is not yet determined. Their period of sex differentiation is usually in the late stage of the tadpole. At this time, if female or male endocrine secretions (reproductive gland fluid) are injected together with mucus gland from a small organ behind the frog and its shell, the tadpole receiving the female endocrine secretion will become female, and the one receiving the male endocrine secretion will become male. The doctor has repeatedly conducted experiments and can arbitrarily make it female or male. From the success of this experiment, it is not difficult to extend its application to humans. Indeed, after a couple gets married, having sons and daughters and healthy sexual performance in married life are greatly related. A vigorous and healthy husband is more likely to have sons after the honeymoon. In addition, men who maintain their reproductive gland fluids with various hygienic methods, so that they are abundant, can also often have sons. The so-called "pure heart and few desires produce more sons" is indeed a profound truth! However, if a man has committed masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or indulges in excessive sexual activity after marriage, resulting in dysfunction of the seminal vesicle, neurasthenia, and the eruption of spermatorrhea and seminal leakage, causing his energy to dissipate, and suffering from brain and kidney deficiency, forgetfulness, and insomnia, then he will often be unable to fulfill his obligations in married life. In this way, not only is it difficult to have children, but the marital relationship may also be difficult to maintain. Therefore, various tragedies often occur in families, or wives even file for divorce with great justification, which is also common in today's society. As for the man himself, because he is physically weak and suffers such a tragedy, how can he endure it! Due to the pain in his heart, his illness is aggravated, leading to premature aging, or death at a young age. The danger is indescribable! There are many methods of treatment, but according to world-renowned doctors and my own many years of experience, it is generally recognized that taking the reproductive gland extract "Reproductive Hormone" is the most effective treatment. This is because this preparation can produce semen and replenish the kidneys, invigorate the brain and activate the blood every day and night, making men energetic, and deepening the couple's love. Having sons and daughters can be guaranteed. If you continue to take it, you can not only completely cure various male sexual pains, but also achieve the effects of prolonging life, and rejuvenating. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Hemitot's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the seminal vesicle and stop leakage, achieving even better results! If patients can come to this clinic to be diagnosed by expert physicians and then undergo scientific treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

### The Harm and Salvation of Nocturnal Emission and Masturbation

In this chaotic era, crossroads are everywhere, and inexperienced young people are wandering down wrong paths, truly a situation fraught with peril. The most powerful forces that tempt young people are alluring women and self-induced sexual stimulation, because young people at the dawn of love possess an intense curiosity about sex. If they lack proper education and correct guidance at this time, few can avoid being lured by their unhealthy surroundings and falling into the abyss of filth. Taking masturbation and nocturnal emission, the most common offenses among young people but overlooked by society, their severe harm is even greater than floods and fierce beasts! First, the number of young people who masturbate is almost too numerous to count. The direct victims are their own sexual nerves, which are ruined, leading to a loss of control of the seminal gate and an oversensitivity of the ejaculation process, resulting in nocturnal emission. Once nocturnal emission begins, it is like having a slippery valve, and a large amount of essence is inevitably lost from the body, causing all parts of the body to become depleted. Various symptoms of weakness, such as brain fatigue and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, backaches and pains, and kidney deficiency and impotence, then follow one after another. The individual's health and the future of their happiness are thus plunged into the darkness of night. Second, due to the damage to sexual function, they will certainly be unable to enjoy a fulfilling married life after marriage. As a result, the wife's youth is wasted and her happiness is ruined, like sending her into a tomb of pain. At the same time, what about the happiness that should be part of their own life? It is unknown whether it will be thrown into a fog or to the far reaches of the sky. Third, from childhood to youth, the burden and cultivation of young people by their parents, siblings, teachers, and the nation is considerable. In terms of the family, they fully expect them to establish a career and bring honor to their ancestors. In terms of society and the nation, they fully expect them to become construction technicians and loyal and brave soldiers on the battlefield, so that they can be capable personnel on the road to resisting the war and building the nation. However, in reality, can they meet these expectations? According to what we know, most young people are sinking into the low-level interests of masturbation and promiscuous pleasure and cannot extricate themselves. How can we not sigh! Conscious young people! At this once-in-a-lifetime, critical juncture, we must use the greatest determination to quit our masturbation and promiscuous pleasure, and take the most effective medicine, "Himei Tuo's Essence-Solidifying Tablets," to strengthen the seminal gate, relieve the oversensitive state of ejaculation, and fundamentally treat nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, it is especially necessary to also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" to nourish the brain and kidneys and increase essence and blood, so that complete recovery of health can certainly be achieved in a short period of time.

Health and Beauty

### The Value of Breast Beauty

— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine

High and elastic breasts are the soul of a healthy and beautiful woman.

A high pair of breasts, set off by a graceful figure, and plump hips, plus a fair and rosy face, adorned with willow eyebrows and cherry lips, revealing pearly teeth and a delicate nose, such a healthy and beautiful woman is not only revered as a goddess by her husband at home, with deep affection between the two, but also when she goes out into society, she is like a moon surrounded by stars everywhere, receiving warm welcomes.

However, such healthy and beautiful women are still a minority in the world. The main reason is that for a woman to achieve the above-mentioned health and beauty, it all depends on the full soundness of the ovarian function. If the ovarian function is sound, then the characteristics of the woman will have good development. The most obvious is that the breasts are firm and elastic, rising in a peak shape. Even if she wears tight and narrow clothes, they will still protrude from the chest. The twin peaks stand opposite each other, with a deep and secluded valley. This is so intoxicating. At the same time, the hips must also be quite developed, and coupled with a lively willow waist, it forms the most mysterious and lovely complete curve of a woman. However, only women with good development can enjoy these characteristics. Others who indulge in weakness and masturbation in their early years, or suffer from irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, or weakness after illness, leading to the deterioration of ovarian function, are disgusted by it, and have difficulty in giving birth. Even in terms of personal temperament, they are often stubborn, narrow-minded, sentimental, and melancholy. The god of happiness and joy has no connection with her. Therefore, the prospects and fate are tragic and unimaginable! To seek a cure, one can only rely on science. According to world-renowned gynecologists such as Oansnasr and Kang Sinan, and according to my experience, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation for women, "Shengzhisu," is the most effective treatment, especially afterwards. Because this medicine can nourish the ovarian function after taking it, vigorously promote metabolism. If you continue to take it, it is guaranteed that the above-mentioned symptoms will be completely cured in a short period of time, and the breasts will gradually rise, transforming ugliness into beauty.

### Former President of Spain Dies in France

Montauban, France. Former President of the Spanish Republican Government, Azaña, came here as a resident after the failure of the Civil War in the spring of 1939. He passed away suddenly last night at the age of sixty. According to news from Vichy, the Mexican ambassador to France, Rodriguez, accompanied by his private secretary and military attache, has already set off to handle the funeral arrangements. It is reported that President Azaña was born on January 1, 1880, in the city of Alcalá (the hometown of the author of *Don Quixote*, Cervantes). He loved literature and philosophy from a young age and enjoyed a great reputation in the literary world. At the age of thirty-three, he served as the Secretary-General of the Ateneo de Madrid, dedicating himself to the study of literature and philosophy for seventeen years. He did not participate in the revolution until the age of fifty, overthrowing the monarchy. When the Republican government was established on April 14, 1931, he took up the post of Minister of War and began to reorganize the Spanish army. At that time, as many as 14,000 junior officers were dismissed, and the army's discipline was strict and its lineup was brand new. At the end of the year, Prime Minister Zamora was elected President of the Republican government, and Azaña filled the vacant position. During his tenure, his policies were too left-leaning and were criticized by public opinion. In September 1933, more than 30 anti-Republican party members were hastily executed in Viches, and public opinion became even more outraged. Azaña resigned on September 12, 1933, and traveled all over the country, delivering speeches everywhere, criticizing the new cabinet without reservation. On February 16, 1936, the Lower House was re-elected, and the left wing won again. Azaña made a comeback and once again served as Prime Minister, actively promoting the policy of the Popular Front. When President Zamora resigned on April 7 of the same year, Azaña was elected to succeed him. The civil war between the Republican government and the Nationalist army broke out during his tenure. It was not until the spring of 1939 that Azaña, knowing that the Republican government no longer had any hope of winning, immediately resigned voluntarily and fled to France to spend the rest of his years.

A Painful History of the European War (1)

### The Beginning and End of the Split Between England and France

The Queen saw me and said to me: "Mr. Morale, I feel extremely sad about the fate of Paris. I express my deep sympathy for the misfortunes of your country's people. I love France very much. Two years ago, when we visited Paris, my heart was connected to the women of your country. Tonight, I plan to talk to them about everything on the radio and express my true feelings."

She then discussed the wording of the broadcast with me and asked about the whereabouts of my wife and children. Her words were sincere. I replied that their whereabouts were unknown. Her gentle eyes showed infinite sympathy, and she was even close to tears, which moved me greatly. When she said, "I deeply love France," I felt that this was not a diplomatic formality, but came from her heart. Like the Queen, the British people originally wanted to do their best to help France, but it was too late.

After Paris fell, Churchill flew to Tours. At that time, France was already in a state of disintegration, which shocked him. No one greeted him at the airport where he landed: no government officials, no representatives. The city was full of refugees, and it took him a lot of effort to find the location of the French government.

In a villa on the banks of the Loire River, French Prime Minister Reynaud told him that he would still insist on fighting to the end, but he might have to resign. The successor cabinet might have to request an armistice. What was Britain's attitude? Churchill stated that he could not release France from the restraint of not making a separate peace. This was the last meeting between the two giants, Reynaud and Churchill.

On June 27, I went to Welland to see Sir Phipps, the former British Ambassador to France. He invited me to listen to the French broadcast together. In the radio, the battle cry of "Citizens, rise up and join the army!" was being sung, and I could not help but sob. I soon learned that Reynaud had gone to the League and the new government had requested a truce. I believe that my British friends, in this mutually painful environment, their accommodating attitude was indeed in line with their noble traditional spirit. They immediately recognized that both sides were at fault in this tragedy, and there was no need to blame each other. Sir Griggs, an official of the War Department, said to me:

"What I want to tell you is that we understand everything and do not blame you. We were unable to help you in time. There was no other way for you but to do this."

He then talked to me about the French fleet. This was what all the British were worried about. In the following days, the atmosphere became even more dangerous. The terms of the armistice caused serious panic. It is said that Sir Campbell, the British Ambassador to France in Bordeaux, was no longer able to obtain any news. Coupin, the French Ambassador to England, also resigned because he disregarded the government he represented and his usual views.

At the last moment, Churchill still wanted to persuade Reynaud's cabinet to continue fighting, advocating that the two great powers of England and France should be merged and governed by one government, with a French person serving as chairman. The people of both countries would have dual nationality. All financial resources and materials would be owned by both countries. This amazing proposal, if put forward a few weeks earlier, would have changed the course of the war. Unfortunately, at that time, France was exhausted and only asked for "immediate" assistance with airplanes, tanks, and artillery.

I heard that General Weygand had mentioned an incident involving Churchill. In the Boer War in South Africa, Churchill had just jumped off a train when he was caught by two South African natives who pointed guns at his chest.

General Weygand said: "If at that time, someone on the train had said to Churchill, 'Resist them—I have enough wealth at home for you to take,' this suggestion would certainly not have been able to save the situation. Now France's situation is the same. It can only 'obey fate,' just like Churchill."

The author does not know whether this is true or false, but his analogy is quite appropriate. However, on Churchill's side, he believed that his suggestion was of great benefit to France, even shocking Congress and confusing the people, who blamed him for being excessive. Now that he sees the other party's unresponsive attitude, he cannot avoid feeling deeply hurt. Many British people also shared his regret, especially those friends who loved France the most.

The British political commentator McCassey said to me: "I am ashamed! I would be very happy to be a French citizen!"

I spent a long night with him and another talented writer, Montemolle, discussing the past and the present, slightly alleviating my worries. McCassey's words were particularly important.

He said: "First, we British people must not forget our friends and their deep friendship. Even if we are far apart and have not heard from each other for many years, even if the French say that the English are all monsters, and the English hear that the French have abandoned them halfway, we must still remember that there are some French people and some English people who have noble minds and practice loyalty and forgiveness. Whenever we have the opportunity, we should love each other and be ten times more affectionate than usual. There is a lack of affection and sincerity in the world, and we must make up for it."

The scene that night and what I saw and heard in the homes of many friends gave me a better impression of England. However, the difficult environment made me very painful. The relationship between the two countries became increasingly serious. General Tagger, a French tank expert, had organized the French National Committee in London and recruited volunteer soldiers, which raised many conscientious questions for many French people. Some people believed that in times of national crisis, one should not engage in separatist movements. Some people were unwilling to recognize the armistice and joined General Tagger.

London and Bordeaux were even attacking each other on the radio. I was deeply saddened by this pointless dispute. Although I advocated stopping at the appropriate time, it had no effect.

At that time, Britain only had one thought in mind: how to strengthen its national defense. In May, Britain did not have a fully equipped army that could be sent to France. By July, it had a million well-trained soldiers who could take up arms to defend the country and resist the strong enemy. Canadian troops and Australian troops would also fight on British soil for the first time. Defensive positions were everywhere in cities and towns. The General Headquarters had learned a lesson from the painful experience of France and ordered the people to stay at home when attacked to avoid interfering with military operations. Each village recruited volunteers to defend against enemy paratroopers. A spirit of courage and bravery was evident everywhere, and it was unprecedented. Britain suddenly realized that France could not be relied upon as a wall and was severely shaken, worrying about the safety of the three islands. But when danger was imminent, the British nation did not flinch, but became even more courageous, as it had shown in its past history.

On July 2, the French military liaison group dismissed me from my post. Since then, because of the severance of transportation between England and France, and because I had agreed to give lectures at Harvard University, I decided to leave England for the United States. The ship I took across the Atlantic was the one that Britain used to send children to Canada. The scene I saw on deck at that time was very moving. A thousand children were playing in the sunlight, surrounded by the cannons that protected them. The escort ships included one cruiser and two destroyers. On the ship, I received the shocking news of the Battle of Oran (referring to the battle in which the British fleet attacked the French fleet in the French African port of Oran). Of all the misfortunes that had befallen me in recent weeks, this was the most terrible. Although I was born a Frenchman, I had had twenty years of friendship with England. I am now like a child whose parents have announced their divorce. Even if I live with my mother, the pain is still imaginable. I said in my heart: "Whether right or wrong, I will always love my country." My reason tells me that the separation of these two nations, which urgently need mutual assistance, is a great regret. I leaned on the railing and looked out. The sea was surging, and the cruiser was running alongside the ship. The British mate saw that I was very worried, brushed past me, and remained silent. At this moment, I suddenly remembered McCassey's words, "No matter what our experience is, never forget that our friendship remains unchanged." I unconsciously sang the Scottish song "Should auld acquaintance be forgot..." A light was hanging high on the turret of the cruiser, and its flashing light was conveying a mysterious message to us.

### Responsible Person of Yanjing University Says: Yanjing University Will Not Be Closed; American Faculty Will Not Leave Temporarily; Wu Qianxiaochang Scholarship Committee Formed

(Hong Kong News) Recently, there have been rumors in Beiping that Yanjing University will be closed due to the evacuation of American expatriates. People from all walks of life are very concerned about the situation of the school. According to a responsible person who just came to Hong Kong from Beiping to discuss raising funds for the "Mr. Wu Leichuan Scholarship" for the 70th birthday of the school's former president, Wu Leichuan, Yanjing University will not be closed due to the situation. American faculty and staff have also decided not to leave temporarily under the current circumstances. The school's president, Stuart Leiden, gave a speech to all students on this matter when he came to Hong Kong (October 11) and instructed them to convey this message to students in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places. President Stuart's speech stated, "The United States Department of State recently advised Americans in China who have families, especially women and children, or who do not need to be in China, to prepare to leave unsafe areas when the situation is very serious. As for the general American people who are related to Yanjing, they have decided to stay here unless the environment evolves to the point where it is absolutely impossible to allow it. According to my (Stuart's) personal observation, the situation will not deteriorate in the near future. This action by the United States is only a precaution. Yanjing will not be affected by it in the near future. Students do not need to worry." In addition, the number of students at the school has recently increased sharply. The number of students this year has reached more than 1,000 (before the war, there were only 700). The school's curriculum and student life are proceeding smoothly as usual.

### Recent News from Workers' Volunteer Night School

The Shanghai Workers' Volunteer School at 809 Tokyo Road, West Shanghai, was founded by Chen Dashen from Anhui. It is currently divided into two schools. Since the beginning of the current semester, three months have passed, and enrollment has been exceptionally enthusiastic. However, regarding the issue of funding, we earnestly hope that benevolent people from all walks of life will generously contribute. Although most of the students' families belong to the laboring class and earn meager monthly wages, their enthusiasm for public welfare is not behind anyone. In the current "Thrift Movement," the families of students from the first school donated a total of seventy-six yuan and thirty cents. In addition, a worker named Wang Aimin from a certain factory donated five yuan from his wages, which is truly commendable. It is reported that the second school is also conducting fundraising activities.

The early morning opening was flat, estimated that the silver house sold to the gold house 10 taels, for 5,490 yuan, only 2 yuan different from the previous day's closing. After opening, the securities gang sold to the silver house 20 taels, falling more than 10 yuan, for 5,475 yuan. However, gold houses and silver houses were inclined to buy in at this time, although the amount was not large, the price had returned from low to high, estimated that the gold house entered the securities gang 10 taels, for 5,510 yuan. However, retail investors held back and waited for high prices to sell, and high prices were difficult to stand, estimated that the silver house sold to the money exchange industry 20 taels, changed to 5,485 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange loose trend turned tight, and the selling momentum stopped immediately, and the buying sound on the floor was high again, estimated that the silver house did 20 taels, as high as 5,535 yuan. At noon, the silver house spit out to the gold house 20 taels, still reported 5,520 yuan, as the midday closing price. In the early afternoon, the situation was very high, estimated that the gold house entered the silver house 10 taels, there were 5,510 yuan, but among them, the money exchange industry and silver houses spit out from time to time, falling after each rise, estimated that the silver house sold to the money exchange industry 20 taels, for 5,515 yuan, the silver house again entered the gold house 20 taels, and again reported 5,528 yuan, after all, because supply exceeded demand, it finally retreated to 5,505 yuan. Before the closing, it reached 5,520 yuan again, and as a result, the closing was 5,510 yuan, slightly higher than the previous day by 18 yuan, a fluctuation of 75 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the spot gold from cash houses was more than 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower, and the current standard gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listing gold, and few transactions were made.

Ornamental Gold Still Unchanged

The selling price of ornamental gold per tael in silver buildings still rarely changes, estimated that Da Tongheng listed 570 yuan, Xin Tongheng was similar to the above price, and the buying price was about 30 yuan lower.

### US Currency Market Alone Was Firm

Yesterday's foreign currency market, the spot gold market price rose slightly, and the British and American gold pounds also rose slightly by 5 jiao, and the British gold notes were still rarely traded, and the market price remained fixed as before. The American gold notes initially retreated to 15 yuan, 8 jiao, and 9 fen, but immediately rose steadily, once as high as 16 yuan and 7 fen, and then took advantage of the low to fall, and finally to 15 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen, a short squeeze of 2 fen higher than the previous day. The Hong Kong notes, however, because there were endless suppliers, the market price was tired and fell, and the Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended lower, the former retreating to 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen, and the latter falling to 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 9 fen.

### Yarn and Cotton - Failure to Break Through Twice and Then Downward - Yarn Price Rebounds - 1,200 Yuan Traded Out

The yarn market turned upward, but actual transactions were not very active. However, most speculators, because the 1,150 yuan mark was not broken through twice, had a slight change of mind, and all had a temporary nature to buy in and go long. As a result, the chips on the table felt tight, and the pulling force was stronger, and the market rebounded.

Now silk, the atmosphere in the opening market was still peaceful, and the price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,180 yuan, falling to 1,176 yuan. Then it was heard that the foreign exchange market was stable, but rumors rose together, and the gold gang and the securities gang came one after another, and all dragged in to add weight. As a result, the momentum turned tight, and the market slowly rose to 1,196 yuan. However, the long head suddenly came to sell, and another drop was seen, but floating households still tended to buy, and the price rose again to outside 1,200 yuan. It is found that the transaction statistics for half a day totaled 5,800 bales, and the 20-count Double Horse market price rose by 16 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchases is listed as follows.

Counterparts 5,300 Hong Kong 500 Total 5,800

Today, 325 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Foreign Cotton Cheaper Than Local Cotton - Abnormal Phenomenon in the Market

Spot cotton transactions are normal. In fact, the Yuanfang has many guests who have purchased foreign cotton, which will soon arrive in Shanghai, and the price is much cheaper than in Shanghai. At the moment, consumption is limited, so the purchase of spot goods is not prosperous. However, the yarn market has slightly rebounded, and the cotton market may improve one step.

The price of Changyin cotton is 217 yuan to 18 yuan, the price of Pingguoer is 173-4 yuan, and the price of Pengjiapu is 263-5 yuan. Today, 280 bales of cotton will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market conditions, initially presented a firm appearance, and then because of the firm stock prices in the Chinese business street, and part of the short covering, as a result, the closing price rose 5-6 pounds higher than the previous day. Indian companies, along with forecasts, rose more than 2 rupees yesterday. Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have continued to be abnormally quiet in recent days. Factories have a weak intention to purchase, and counterparts are also holding a wait-and-see attitude. However, because the market inventory is not abundant, the selling price is slightly stagnant.

### Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Rises Wildly

The factory cloth market yesterday calmed down with rumors, and hoarders began to move again. Guests and counterparts also absorbed at low prices, and transactions suddenly became prosperous. Selling prices of various cloths uniformly rebounded, bleached and dyed cloth rose 2.5 to 5 jiao, coarse cloth rose 1 to 2.5 jiao, fine cloth twill rose 2.5 to 5 jiao, Fugui fine cloth increased to 32.5 yuan, fine twill 31 yuan. More than 800 pieces were transacted on this street, with hoarders absorbing a larger amount. Zhejiang and Fujian merchants handled more than 300 pieces of blue cloth, line cloth, and colored twill, Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, and overseas Singapore and other places handled more than 6,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and twill. Today, 667 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong, 180 pieces to Singapore, and 7 pieces to Penang.

Dong cloth rose wildly and fell rapidly, with huge ups and downs. As a result, fine cloth rose 7.5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece, fine twill increased by 5 jiao, and serge rose 3 fen per yard. In the morning market, Longtou fine cloth rose directly from 34 yuan and 6-7 jiao to 35 yuan and 4 jiao. After the closing, the market opened at a jump, seeing 36 yuan. Sijunzi serge peaked at 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 1 fen. However, rumors soon arose, and profits were sold off, and the falling trend was also fierce. Longtou fell to 35 yuan and 3.5 jiao, and serge fell to 1 yuan and 8 fen. However, counterparts believed that actual sales were good, and most were bullish.

### Single-Sided Flannel is Still Popular

Yesterday, the flannel market was still good, transactions were prosperous, standards were stable and firm, and single-sided high-striped flannel was still quite popular throughout Shanghai. Chinese-style long gowns and robes, and Western-style sweater materials were all selling well. Navy blue and dark blue were selling more smoothly, and the sales of camel color were slightly sluggish. There are various patterns, such as wide stripes, narrow stripes, fine stripes, two-three stripes, one-three stripes, and two-three stripes, each with its own needs. The products from our factory only include Yongxing and Hongkang. The wholesale price of the first grade is 25-6 yuan per yard, the second grade is 20 yuan, and the ordinary grade is 21-2 yuan. The ordinary grade of British products is sold at 37-8 yuan.

### Grain - The People's Food is Truly Calamitous - There are Still Rumors That There Will Be Insufficient Space for Foreign Rice in the Future - Before the Price Rises, It is Still Corrupt Merchants Stirring Up Trouble

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 1,522 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docked at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Lisheng wheel also arrived at the port yesterday morning, carrying 200 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the Yisifu wharf for unloading.

The foreign rice market soared again yesterday, and spot and forward goods all rose uniformly. However, the reason for the rise was not unexpected digestion and high production prices, but only because of the recent lack of ship space and reduced orders. As for the fixed price, it is still generally planned, and people's hearts have been brought up. Speculators and floating longs are all taking advantage of the situation to be active, and cargo owners are also trying to defend the price. Therefore, the opening price in the early market rose step by step, and the midday market had risen nearly 1 yuan compared to the day before yesterday. In the afternoon, the buying momentum was even stronger, and cargo owners were very persistent in defending the price, so the price rose more than 1 yuan. As a result, the spot rice was about 2 yuan higher than the day before yesterday. New transactions were not settled, and the opening price of imported No. 2 Saigon was shouted at 73 yuan, and then from 73.5 to 73.8 yuan. The afternoon saw even more beauty, and a certain party sold 500 tons, and the price reached 74.5 yuan, which was 1.7 to 2 yuan higher than the day before yesterday. Spot transactions throughout the day also exceeded 10,000 bags. The total amount of imported original packages was 800 tons, estimated No. 1 Saigon at 66.5 to 66 yuan, No. 2 at 61.7 jiao, 61.1 jiao, Huojiao at 64.5 jiao, determined to be 61.8 jiao, No. 2 Siam at 60.05 yuan, 60 yuan, Xiaowen at 60.07 jiao, 59.5 jiao, Tokyo tip at 55 yuan, broken tip at 51.2 jiao, 50 yuan, Milu at 51.1 yuan, 54 yuan, Wuhu tip at 59.4 jiao, 59 yuan.

New Japonica tip and tea, wild rice, etc. totaled more than 1,000 dan, of which new Japonica was very few, but the sales market was unique, resulting in a situation where it was insufficient for distribution for a while, and the price increased by 1-2 yuan. The original package specially opened at 81-2 to 80 yuan, the second at 76 yuan, the dan was seen at 77 yuan, 74-5 yuan. The green seed wild rice was just average, opened wild rice at 80.05 yuan, 80 yuan, the green seed at 77.5 yuan, 76 yuan. Duyang tip also lacked honor and disgrace, the original package of Du tip was specially 72 yuan, Yang tip was 67 yuan, and the removal of glutinous rice was again lax, which was a fixed decision, etc.

### Foreign Flour Can Arrive in Ten Days

Yesterday's spot flour market was as flat as ever, and the Hua flour factory's market price stood firm and did not move. The two factories wholesaled more than 8,000 bags, which was quite enough for the needs of this street. The recycled goods, the old Che flour, had few chips, and the stomach was weak early on, so supply and demand were both silent, and there were no agreements. The foreign flour continued to be in a state of stagnation, and according to foreign bank news, the foreign flour determined by this decision will generally arrive in about ten days, and there are few days left, and people's hearts are uneasy, and speculative buying and selling are even less involved. It is heard that this street purchased 200 bags of Double Eagle brand foreign flour, and the price was 18.5 yuan, similar to the Hua flour's guest price. Yesterday, 200 bags of flour came from Hong Kong.

Wheat - The arrival was sparse and the sales were weak, and the market was without any excitement. It is found that since the Japanese factory was ordered to prohibit transportation to the concession, the production of Phoenix flour has suddenly decreased, so the need for raw materials is also not greedy. In addition to the goods sent to the factory, the price is limited, and only 100-odd bags are received every day, and they are not bought in the market. The Hua factory and other sales households also lack goods to receive, so the transaction becomes quiet every day.

### Oil Cake - Hoarders in the Oil Market are Stirring

Yesterday's oil market in the morning trend, inheriting the previous day's withering situation, the market continued to be downstream, and the transaction was quite sluggish. By the time the market closed in the afternoon, rumors were rife, and the falling trend stopped immediately. The reason was that the Qingdao market reported a rise, the international situation was very tight, and there was a shortage of ship space, so speculators had another excellent opportunity, and the market atmosphere jumped frequently. Far-term raw oil was particularly popular, and a total of 50 dan of Daya Factory soybean oil were opened, the price being 84.25 yuan, 300 cans of Yantai listening to raw oil, the price being 101 yuan, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, the price being 72.5 yuan to 71.5 yuan, 200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, the price being 101 yuan to 05 jiao, the closing being 07.5 jiao, 300 barrels were handed over in late November, the price being 101.25 yuan to 05 jiao, and it rose to 01.5 yuan, 800 barrels were ordered for late December, the price being 102.75 yuan, falling to 01.75 yuan, and then stepped up to 03 yuan to close the market.

Today, 215 bags of soybeans and 585 cans of raw oil will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 400 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Singapore.

### Sugar Market - Foreign Sugar Actual Sales Were Flat

The sugar market turned loose because actual sales were weak. The association's planned market spot goods 2-4 coarse white this stack 71 yuan, outer stack 70.5 yuan, a total of 5 jiao, Taikoo's Che white upper grade was very hard, and the lower grade was also 5 jiao, B-Xixi machinery 70.5 yuan, Dong stack 70 yuan, DY Mark West stack 66.2 jiao, HX Mark Si stack 66 yuan, Dong stack 65.5 jiao, HM Mark Dong stack 62.8 jiao, Hechi spot goods 53.8 yuan to 4 yuan, road goods 54 yuan to 4 yuan and 2 jiao, the factory's No. 1 ice 91.5 yuan, Jingming ice 93 yuan, and 860 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong.

### North and South Goods - Preserved Dates' Sales Season Has Passed

Few preserved dates have been transported and arrived, and the market stock is also thin, but since the sales season has passed, the removal from all sides is relatively sluggish, and the market price has slightly loosened. Yesterday, the bald price was 125 yuan, and the rest were returned as before.

### Coal - Tong Deli Coal is Short and Popular

Tong Deli Bai Mou, although the gray market was already tight last week, because the hoarders took advantage of the high to come out of the cage, the market still had spot goods to receive. As of now, the old orders have been exhausted, and a certain bank has closed and stopped selling, and the market atmosphere has become more tense. Numbers 1 and 2 blocks have been shouted at 226 yuan, but there are still few transactions. The prices in this street's stores are uniformly picked up, and it is estimated that each set of festival blocks is 12 yuan, and each load of Lingjiao Kao blocks is 12.4 yuan.

### Silk and Tea - Silk Price Gradually Falls

Yesterday, the local silk market had very few transactions, and the silk price was stagnant and weak. Yesterday, the white factory sold 81 points at 4,760 yuan, and compared with the record in early October, it gradually fell, and it has seen a huge amount of 500 jiao. This is probably due to the sluggish silk price abroad.

The Yokohama silk price is unchanged, and the spot goods are maintained at a slightly higher level of 25 yuan, and the trend may be better, because the far-term goods have turned firm. The ups and downs of the New York silk price are slight, with only a difference of one or two cents.

### From New York Raw Silk Statistics: US Ban on Japanese Silk Imports Seems a Trivial Act

The import and sales of raw silk in New York in October both improved, with imports increasing by 17,336 bales. Among them, Shanghai silk only increased by 250 bales, while Japanese silk increased by 17,336 bales. This proves that the US ban on Japanese silk imports is a trivial matter. Therefore, silk prices in October were also quite bullish. According to reports, Yokohama once rose to 1,500 yuan in that month, but fell in the second half of the month. The consumption of raw silk in New York increased by 2,049 bales in October, due to seasonal factors.

### Hardware: The Price of Wire Rods is Weak, and the Market for Bar Iron is Stagnant. Copper Ore and Rattan Were Imported Yesterday

Since the South Zhejiang merchants stopped dealing in wire nails, the wire nail market has been weak. In addition, the volume of Tianjin flue-cured tobacco and blue cloth from the northern route has also decreased, resulting in a sluggish market and a lack of activity. Although construction companies, warehousing companies, and occasional users on this street occasionally make purchases and sales, the amount is very small and insufficient to affect the overall situation. Therefore, once the market loses momentum, morale declines, and prices continue to fall, with each barrel of Bessemer steel wire rods at 53 yuan. However, due to the continuous arrival of overseas goods for its raw material (wire rod), relying only on the existing inventory in this port, the industry's thinking is quite firm, and the market price is holding steady, still quoted at 55 yuan per bale. Also, yesterday, 88 pieces of copper, 95 packages of ore, and 137 pieces of rattan were shipped from Hong Kong.

### The American Community in Shanghai Unanimously Supports Roosevelt's Re-election Due to His Assistance to China, Which Has Won Him Unlimited Sympathy. The Only Criterion for President is the Ability to Fulfill the Role.

While 50 million citizens in the United States voted in the presidential election yesterday, the American community in Shanghai held a mock vote, with over 90% supporting Roosevelt's continued tenure as master of the White House. The American community in Shanghai's widespread support for Roosevelt today is in stark contrast to 1936, when over 90% of the American community supported Landon and hoped he would become the next president. According to a well-known American in Shanghai who is concerned about politics, this rapid shift of enthusiastic support from one party to another in just four short years is unprecedented among American communities around the world.

Familiarity Breeds Confidence, Forever Enjoying Public Trust

It is said that the reason why the American community in Shanghai is leaning towards the Democratic Party is that both Europe and Asia are currently at war. The choice of president is no longer based on political party affiliation, but only on who is best suited for the job. Roosevelt has eight years of experience in the White House, not only is he familiar with the work, but also his admirable diplomatic skills make him the most qualified presidential candidate. Most Americans deeply believe that the next four years will be the most difficult period in American history.

Future New Deal, Suitable for National Conditions

He also pointed out that Roosevelt's New Deal is not fascism. Due to the experience of the past four years, people have begun to realize that America's future policies and domestic plans can no longer use "individualism" as a slogan. They understand that certain social undertakings must be governed by the government, and power, materials, and manpower must be better managed. The purpose of the New Deal is to achieve this. Fewer members of the American community in Shanghai are betting on this presidential election because no one is betting on Wilkie, and most deeply believe that Roosevelt will be re-elected. They also pointed out that even on Wall Street, Roosevelt's odds would be 8 to 5. From Jones of the US Navy to Commissioner Hermlik, all expressed that "Roosevelt will be invincible."

Most of the Shanghai Community Supports Roosevelt

According to the Continental News, a reporter inquired about the opinions of the American community in Shanghai last night (4th). The 48 states in the United States will hold presidential elections today (5th). Roosevelt and Wilkie, the two presidential candidates, are competing fiercely. If Americans living in Shanghai could participate in the election, the number of votes in favor of Roosevelt serving a third term as president would greatly increase. It is estimated that 75% of Americans in Shanghai support Roosevelt. In the past few months, very few members of the American community in Shanghai have turned to Wilkie. However, supporters of President Roosevelt admit that there are also many people within the United States who originally intended to vote for Roosevelt, but have turned to Wilkie in recent weeks.

Assistance to China Wins Hearts and Minds

According to observers from various sectors of the American community, although Wilkie has promised to continue the current government's policies in the Far East, this is still a promise that has not been translated into action. President Roosevelt has indeed taken steps, wielding a "big stick" to aid Chongqing, to alleviate the overall situation in China, and to contain Japanese aggression. On the surface, the American community is quite disturbed by the State Department's evacuation plan, but other than some minor complaints, the impact on the American community in the Far East's attitude towards Roosevelt is minimal. This is because the American community sees the overall situation as serious and recognizes the evacuation as a step in the right direction.

Predicting the Result: Four to One

There are also a small number who view the evacuation advice as a clever tactic of the Republican campaign. Last night, many members of the American community bet money on the election results, with Republicans who firmly believed that Roosevelt would be elected even betting four to one that President Roosevelt would win, but there were no people betting on Wilkie's victory by betting more against less. It is said that the amounts wagered were not large.

### Nuona Jing She to Organize Winter Disaster Relief

As the depths of winter approach, the poor are suffering from hunger and cold, which is extremely pitiful. The members of the Nuona Jing She in Shanghai, based on the Buddhist spirit of compassion, have initiated disaster relief efforts and have already organized a committee, electing Tang Huiying as the director. They are dividing the work into groups and actively carrying out the work. They have also advanced funds and pre-ordered 2,000 pieces of relief clothing and various other foods in preparation for distribution. It is said that the Dharani mantra power of the Jing She is inconceivable. Before distribution, they must recite sutras and bless the items.

### Bloody Incident Occurred in Hongkou Yesterday: Japanese Military Officer Assassinated. The Deceased Was Japanese Navy Ensign Sho Nakamura. North Jiangxi Road Remained Under Heavy Guard Until Midnight.

Near North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, at around 2:45 PM yesterday, a sudden assassination occurred. The victim was a Japanese Navy Ensign named Sho Nakamura. As he was passing through the area, someone suddenly appeared behind him with a gun and opened fire, hitting him in a vital spot. The Japanese Ensign was carrying his own handgun and tried to draw it in retaliation, but failed. After achieving their goal, the assailant fled without a trace. After receiving the news, the Japanese immediately dispatched a large contingent of Japanese military police to guard the area. They immediately cut off traffic and conducted a large-scale search, creating an unusually tense situation. After the incident, the Hongkou Police Department also dispatched red patrol cars carrying a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to assist in apprehending the perpetrator. The Japanese Ensign was immediately taken to a Japanese hospital for treatment, but died soon after due to the severity of his injuries. The location of the incident remained heavily guarded until midnight, preventing residents from entering and exiting. The perpetrator is still unknown.

Another Bloody Incident

At the home of Japanese national Jotaro Takahashi, located at 222 Dongyang Street, Disweiyi Road, Hongkou, around 12:00 AM the night before last, four or five people armed with sharp knives and axes broke in through a window on the upper floor. Using the sharp weapons, they repeatedly slashed the husband and wife in the chest and abdomen dozens of times, killing them both on the spot. The floorboards were covered in blood, dripping down below. The assailants seized all the precious metals and gold bonds from the house and escaped. There was also a Yangzhou maid in the house, but she was sound asleep and did not wake up. When she got up in the morning, she smelled blood everywhere. She went upstairs and was shocked to see that her masters had both been killed, lying in pools of blood. She rushed out to scream for help, and nearby residents gathered.

### American Red Cross Medicines Transported to China via the Burma Road (Now Shipped by Sea to Rangoon)
According to information received yesterday, Mr. Baker, the director of the China-Foreign Relief Association, is currently preparing to transport 100 tons of medicine to Free China via the Burma Road. It is reported that Mr. Baker has already departed from the United States by Clipper flying boat, while the batch of medicines, including a large quantity of quinine, is being transported by ship to Rangoon. This quinine is like timely rain to the medical authorities in Yunnan who are working to prevent malaria. In addition to quinine, it is reported that there are also large quantities of gauze bandages and other medical supplies.

Resumption of Parcel Post to Northern Jiangsu
A postal notice states that large and personal parcels to 25 locations including Taixian and Hai'an can now be accepted for posting. Personal parcels to 25 locations including Xinghua can now be accepted for posting, while large parcels are still temporarily suspended from acceptance.

Important Announcement from the Adjustment Association to All Sectors: Participate in Group Rice Purchases to Prevent Disconnection in the Event of Changing Circumstances
The Shanghai Food Adjustment Association respectfully announced to all sectors yesterday, stating that the Association was organized by enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life in Shanghai with the aim of promoting group rice purchases by all sectors to regulate the city's food supply. Since its establishment, more than 610 units, including various industrial and commercial groups, companies, and firms, have entrusted the Association to directly order foreign rice on their behalf, totaling 27 batches and over 61,000 bags. The Association has also indirectly promoted self-ordering of foreign rice by various sectors, amounting to hundreds of thousands of bags. This work is all done on a voluntary basis, which is well known to all. Now that new grain has been harvested, due to various reasons,

Supply is Not Abundant
In the future, the city's food supply will inevitably still rely on foreign rice for supplementation. However, the international situation is unpredictable, and the future of transportation and exchange rates are all problematic. Therefore, taking advantage of the current loose foreign exchange, smooth transportation, and relatively cheap prices of foreign rice, this announcement is made with the utmost sincerity, hoping that all sectors will make plans as early as possible to avoid being unprepared at the last minute. The Association also hopes for enthusiastic participation and entrustment of orders. The ordering method is at least 50 bags each time, with a deposit of 40 yuan in foreign currency per bag. Application forms can be obtained from the Association or the Trust Department of Jin Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road, so that the city's rice reserves

Will Gradually Become Abundant
and rice prices will become increasingly stable, which will not only benefit oneself but also greatly benefit others. The future of the food supply depends on this," and so on. All sectors wishing to participate in rice purchases can go directly to Room 311, 3rd Floor, YMCA, Eight Immortals Bridge to register. The Association expressed its extreme welcome, as the long-term stability of the entire food supply in Shanghai still depends on the city's residents automatically

Ordering Foreign Rice
and transporting it to Shanghai for storage, so that there is preparedness. The Association also hopes for enthusiastic participation in the group ordering of foreign rice organized by the Shanghai Food Adjustment Association. At the same time, it suggests that, except for large factories that require a large amount of rice daily and have relatively abundant capital to order large quantities of foreign rice individually, all shops with relatively small capital and scope should have their respective trade associations handle the registration procedures on their behalf. Once a certain amount has been collected, the Food Adjustment Association can also be entrusted to place the order on their behalf. Do Not

Rely on Rice Shops
As for employees of various institutions and organizations, they should immediately participate in the group ordering of foreign rice organized by their respective institutions and organizations. However, for individual rice purchases by citizens, it is hoped that the Food Association will improve the rice purchasing methods, such as reducing the deposit amount or redefining the purchase quantity to one bag or half a bag, so that group rice purchases can be popularized throughout the city. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will accept the recommendations of the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee and promptly advise residents within their respective jurisdictions to plan to participate in group ordering of foreign rice. If this is delayed any longer, once drastic changes occur at home and abroad, the source of foreign rice will be difficult to continue. At that time, speculative rice merchants will take the opportunity to stir up trouble, and the livelihood of ordinary people will be difficult, and the public security within the concession will be in a precarious situation.

Police Department Rectifies Measuring Instruments
According to the Municipal Council, the Police Department of the Council has dispatched personnel to investigate the measuring instruments used in various shops within the concession from October 16th to 31st. As a result, 27 shops were investigated, and 44 scales were inspected. Among them, 25 were found to be non-compliant. Legal action or warnings were taken accordingly, and orders were given to rectify the situation.

Greek Nationals Enlist, Transportation Inconvenient, Departure Temporarily Difficult, Relief Fund Already Raised 60,000
The Greek Relief Fund, initiated by the Greek Consulate General in this city to assist wartime refugees, has raised over 60,000 yuan as of yesterday. The Greek Consul General, Mr. Yenoulatos, expressed his gratitude to the Greek nationals in this city and other foreigners who donated. Since the invasion of Greece by Italy, the Greek Consulate General in this city has gathered enthusiastic Greek nationals every day requesting to return to their country to enlist in the army, but there are currently no neutral ships sailing to Greece, so departure is not possible. In the future, as soon as transportation is possible, the Greek authorities will allow them to return to their country to serve.

Defeat of the Italian Army
According to a neutral observer of the European war situation, the recent Italian offensive against Greece has been met with united resistance from the Greek people, and the political situation has suffered a setback. According to news reports, Greek troops have advanced several miles into the Albanian border. The German and Italian sides initially did not expect the Greek people to be so fond of their freedom. Now they are planning to use German forces to achieve results that

Cannot be Obtained
The observer said that this plan will be as unlikely as their previous prediction that Greece could be easily obtained. Moreover, British troops are fulfilling their promise to land in Greece, and the Abyssinian militia is still resisting the Italian army. Former King Selassie is currently in Sudan, meeting with Albanian leaders. Since Albania was occupied by Italy, it has deeply hoped for an opportunity to cooperate with the British army to restore its territory. The British troops' landing in Greece will greatly boost morale, and the future trend will gradually become clear. Italy's ambition to seize Greece will only prove to be a futile effort.

Japanese Troops Withdraw from the Canidrome
According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," when British troops withdrew two months ago, there was talk that Japanese troops would take over the defense of western Shanghai. The original site of the Canidrome on Great Western Road was occupied by Japanese troops and converted into a barracks. It is now learned that the Japanese troops there have withdrawn and been transferred to Fahua Town next to Columbia Road. The original site of the Canidrome will be converted into a "Western Funeral Home" today (5th). The old Canidrome signs have all been removed. It has been learned that there are two former gambling venues in the "Badlands" of western Shanghai that have been converted into funeral homes. The other is the former Willdon gambling venue on Yuyuan Road, which has now been converted into the "Zhaofeng" Funeral Home. According to Chinese sources, both funeral homes were established by Lu Ying.

Typhoon Rapidly Approaching, Shanghai Gradually Threatened
The Zikawei Observatory has learned that a violent typhoon that occurred near Guam Island in the Pacific Ocean had reached 15 degrees north latitude and 137 degrees east longitude at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, according to a report from the Zikawei Observatory. The wind direction is north-northwest, and the center is within 120 nautical miles. The coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are gradually being threatened. The temperature in Shanghai yesterday reached a high of 82 degrees and a low of 70.2 degrees, which was unusually hot. However, as the northern high pressure approaches, the weather will turn cold.

Japanese Merchants Use 500,000 Yuan to Purchase Five Portuguese Ships, Seized for More Than a Year on the Pretext of Unclear Nationality
According to foreign sources, five Portuguese merchant ships seized by the Japanese in the Zhejiang Sea on April 5th of last year have been detained near the "Fish Market Association" in Yangshupu, moored at buoys No. 30 and 31 of the Huangpu River. During this period, the Portuguese Consul General, Alves, has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, but the Japanese have not released the ships, citing unclear nationality. It is now learned that the five Portuguese ships, which have been detained for more than a year, have been forcibly purchased by Japanese merchants for 500,000 yuan in national currency, and the formal transfer of ownership will be completed in the next few days. The five Portuguese ships, including the "Fule," "Libao," "Meile," and the steamship "Feiside," and the paddle steamer "Pengba," which originally sailed on the Shanghai-Ou line and the Ningbo-Dinghai line, all had a net tonnage of 300 to 600 tons. When coastal shipping was smooth, they all sailed in coastal ports and were quite active. It has been learned that last spring, Japanese warships repeatedly seized foreign ships in the Zhejiang Sea, totaling more than ten ships, including the Portuguese ships "Tang Sai," "Tang Bei," "Tang Qiao," "Li Shi," "Fule," and the German ship "Feikang." Subsequently, after negotiations with the Japanese side by the Portuguese and German consuls, most of them have been released one after another, while several ships were forcibly purchased by the Japanese at reduced prices. The five ships, including "Li Shi," were seized on the pretext of unclear nationality, which required further investigation, and have been detained until now and forcibly purchased by Japanese merchants.

French Consul General Denies Dissolution of White Russian Unit
According to a Havas News Agency report from this city on the 5th, regarding the news report that the French Concession authorities were about to dissolve the White Russian Auxiliary Police Force of the Police Department and dismiss Jewish employees of the Municipal Council, the French Consul General in this city, Mr. Magre, recently issued an official statement denying it. It stated: "Today, several newspapers published a news report, claiming that the French Concession authorities intend to dissolve the White Russian Auxiliary Police Force and dismiss Jewish employees of the Municipal Council. I hereby solemnly deny this and declare that the French Concession authorities have never considered such measures. The White Russian Auxiliary Police Force has always been extremely diligent, and their loyalty and enthusiasm in service are beyond reproach. At this time of difficulty, we can only be grateful to the team. It can be seen that the news reported by various newspapers is not only absurd but also serves other purposes. The French Concession authorities hereby take this opportunity to inform the local press not to be misled by such rumors." (Note: This newspaper did not publish this news.)

Armistice Day, British Nationals Celebrate, Lay Wreaths, Hold Banquets, Special Services on Sunday
According to the "Continental Times," November 11th is the anniversary of the Armistice of the World War. It is reported that on this day, British and French nationals living in Shanghai will celebrate their victory in the war separately. On the British side, at 3:30 p.m., the British Victory Association, on behalf of various British associations in Shanghai, will hold a special banquet at the club in the HSBC Building. In the afternoon, refreshments will be provided to members of the Central Overseas Women's Federation. On Sunday morning, November 10th, a memorial service will be held at the Union Church on Jiangxi Road. The time and details will be announced later. The French nationals in this city will also commemorate the day without much fanfare, only holding a service at the Sacred Heart Church at No. 36, rue des Pères, and will not lay wreaths. It is expected that the French troops stationed in Shanghai will not hold drills.

Northern Defense Area of the Central District Taken Over by the Police Department, Only Baoshan Road and the First Special Court Still Defended by the Volunteer Corps
The Shanghai Volunteer Corps has taken over the British military defense area in the northern part of the central district of the Public Concession for two months and ten days. However, when the Shanghai Volunteer Corps took over the northern defense area of the central district, according to the method of the British garrison in Shanghai, the northern part of the central district was divided into six small defense areas, namely: (1) the intersection of North Henan Road and Baoshan Road, (2) Qianjiang Guild Hall, (3) Kaifeng Road, (4) the dry bridge at the end of North Zhejiang Road, (5) the First Special District Local Court on North Zhejiang Road, (6) the iron gate on North Xizang Road. Among them, the Qianjiang Guild Hall and Kaifeng Road defense areas were the first to be abandoned, followed by the dry bridge defense area at the end of North Zhejiang Road, which was also abandoned and handed over to the patrol police of the Municipal Council's Police Department. However, according to news received yesterday, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Command has also abandoned the Xizang Road iron gate defense area and handed it over to the patrol police for patrol. Thus, since taking over the northern part of the central district, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has abandoned four out of six defense areas in its northern area. However, it is still responsible for defending the defense area at the intersection of Baoshan Road at the end of North Henan Road and the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road. The reason for this is still difficult to ascertain. According to informed sources, the reason why the Volunteer Corps abandoned the four defense areas is that the patrol police of the police department can maintain the security of the defense areas.

Seized Greek Ship Released Yesterday Morning
According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the Greek cargo ship "Coulouras Xenos" was seized by the Japanese Navy near the Jiutuan (transliteration) lightship outside the port on Saturday evening. After mutual consultation between the Greek and Japanese authorities in this city, the ship was released yesterday morning (5th) and sailed back to Shanghai. According to Mr. Yenoulatos, the Greek Consul in Shanghai, the ship was seized due to a misunderstanding. He then began negotiations with the Japanese authorities here for the release of the ship, which proceeded smoothly. It is reported that the ship, with a deadweight of 8,300 tons, sailed from Shanghai to a port in South China on Saturday morning. Shortly after leaving the port, it was discovered that the ship was only carrying ballast. The shipowner ordered it to return to Shanghai. On Saturday evening, the ship approached Wusongkou and was suddenly ordered to stop by a Japanese warship, which then seized it. The Greek Consul immediately received a report and consulted with the Japanese authorities. The consultation was completed last night (4th), and the ship was released.

Thrift Promotion Week Enthusiastically Prepared
The first anniversary of the establishment of the National Thrift and Savings Movement Committee will be on November 10th. The authorities have stipulated that the National Thrift and Savings Propaganda Week will be held from the 10th to the 16th. The two general associations of the Thrift and Savings Committee and the Savings Promotion Committee have instructed all branch associations and savings promotion groups across the country to mobilize jointly. Party and government agencies and industrial, commercial, cultural, and vocational groups in all provinces, cities, and counties across the country have also generally participated in the preparations. The situation at that time will be unprecedentedly enthusiastic. In order to adapt to the convenience of the national people to participate in savings, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has followed the order of the Ministry to open savings businesses in all of the more than 3,000 post offices and postal agencies across the country within the year. The Central Trust Bureau and the China Communications and Agriculture Banks have also followed the method of establishing simple savings offices generally passed by the Joint Council of the Four Banks, and began to prepare for the establishment of simple savings offices in mining areas with many workers, cultural areas with concentrated schools, production areas or distribution centers for large-scale special products, and ports with prosperous commerce and more currency circulation, in order to promote the widespread promotion of the thrift movement. According to sources in the travel industry, water-land intermodal transport has now been arranged between Jinhua and Yongjia, and the journey takes two days. The intermodal transport vehicle departs at 5:00 a.m. every morning, and the buses to Lishui have also been advanced by one hour, with two shifts at 5:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.

Members of the Three People's Principles Youth League Are All Very Inspired
According to a wealthy businessman who was recently rescued after being kidnapped, when he was detained, there were many young members of the Three People's Principles Youth League who had been arrested from various places. He witnessed several young people who, despite being subjected to severe interrogation and torture, did not yield in the slightest. Everyone's spirit was extremely inspired. They often sang patriotic songs and shouted patriotic slogans.

German Surgical Expert Dr. Pribram Arrives in Shanghai, Pribram Was Formerly a Professor at the University of Berlin, Renowned in the World for His Electrosurgery of the Abdomen
The world-renowned surgical expert and scientist Professor B.O.C. Pribram recently arrived in Shanghai from the United Kingdom. Dr. Pribram was formerly a professor of surgery at the University of Berlin and a director of major hospitals in Berlin. He is a pioneer in the study and treatment of diseases of the abdomen, liver, gallbladder, and kidneys, and is known worldwide for his contribution to electrosurgery, which has recently been widely adopted. Most of the modern liver disease experts are his students. Recently, Dr. Pribram traveled to Canada and the United States, where he lectured on his academic knowledge. He arrived in London in 1937, where he lectured at the British Post Graduate Medical School and various universities in London, with the main topic being "Modern Warfare Surgery." Several years ago, Dr. Pribram was invited by an Indian prince to treat his illness, but this is his first visit to the Far East.

Police Department Deputy Chief Yao Ke Resigns to Go to Australia, He Has Left Shanghai for a Short Vacation, His Vacancy Seems Likely to Be Filled by Robertson
According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," it was learned from reliable sources this morning (5th) that Yao Ke, Deputy Chief of the Police Department of the Municipal Council and head of the Political Section, who has served in the Police Department for nearly 28 years, has recently resigned and will go to Australia to retire. Yao Ke left Shanghai today for a short vacation, but he may not return to Shanghai when his vacation is over. Instead, he will go to Australia to reunite with his family. It is reported that two months ago today, on September 6th, Yao Ke was suddenly attacked by two thugs when he left his residence on Yuyuan Road to go to the General Patrol House. Yao Ke bravely fought back and escaped unharmed. The thugs fled in different directions when the plan was exposed. It is reported that Yao Ke is from Nottingham, England, is 48 years old, and arrived in Shanghai from England in 1902. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Police Department and served in a low-level position. Because of his effective work, he gradually rose in rank and managed the "B" police district for several years. Three years ago, he was appointed as the director of the Political Section. His successor has not yet been appointed, but it is generally expected that Robertson, the head of the Criminal Section, who also handles matters related to the Political Section, will soon officially take over Yao Ke's vacancy.

Goods Imported and Exported from the Concession Are Obstructed by the Japanese Army, Attempting to Monopolize Commerce in the Occupied Areas, Chinese and Foreign Merchants Alike Suffer Damage
The Japanese Army in China has recently been carrying out a large-scale "plan" to control commercial goods due to a lack of war funds. The prohibition of the entry and exit of commodities in this city is the realization of this plan, which has lasted for two months, causing commerce in the concession to be almost at a standstill, and all commerce in the occupied areas has been deprived.

Products of the Concession Prohibited from Exporting
According to the Pingming News Agency's investigation with several merchants, Japanese sentries at the border of the concession prohibit any goods from being transported out, especially the export of piece goods, sugar, and cigarettes. Currently, the Japanese army does not allow finished pieces of cloth to be carried out of the concession, causing the business of various weaving factories and cotton cloth shops in this city to plummet, and they will be difficult to maintain. However, this move by the Japanese army has also put Japanese spinning mills in a difficult situation. Currently, the Japanese spinning mills in this city have first reduced the number of night shifts, so starting from the fourth day of the previous month, they only operate day shifts for five days a week.

British and Dutch Sugar Cannot Be Sold
In addition, the Japanese army also restricts the export of sugar, and the British and Dutch merchants are the most affected by this significant loss. The supply of sugar in the occupied areas of central China mostly relies on the British and Dutch, but now they are prohibited by the Japanese army from being transported to various ports along the Yangtze River, and they cannot operate. The British and Dutch sugar merchants have appealed to their respective governments for negotiations. At the same time, according to Chinese from the occupied areas, the source of sugar in the occupied areas has been cut off. Not only has the price soared, but there are some places where there is no sugar to buy. In addition, other seafood products are in the same situation due to the prohibition of exports, which will soon make it impossible for southern goods stores in the occupied areas to operate.

Agricultural Products Prohibited from Exporting
As for agricultural products in the occupied areas, the Japanese army also prohibits their export, forcing the main commerce in the occupied areas to a standstill, causing extreme panic among merchants both inside and outside the concession. It is reported that the Japanese army's move is an attempt to monopolize all commerce in its occupied areas, and use this special profit to make up for its insufficient military expenses.

At 1:45 p.m. yesterday, a robber dressed in a dark khaki suit went to the shop and knocked on the door. Apprentice Qian Zhenhua (15 years old, from Changshu) answered the door. The robber asked if Mr. Zhu was at home. Qian replied that he was not. He then asked if the accountant, Yang Yongxi, was there. Qian replied that he was out. At this time, five robbers following behind, dressed differently, took out pistols and threatened the apprentice, forbidding him to make a sound. At the same time, Huang Jinyao (16 years old, local), an apprentice from the Chengda Rice Mill in the same industry, was about to leave the rice shop after settling accounts when he was stopped by the robbers and not allowed to leave.

Hostess Hears the Alarm, Flees to a Neighbor's House
Fortunately, Zhu's daughter-in-law, Ms. Zhu, 20 years old, was looking out of the window on the upper floor. When she saw that the robbers were all holding pistols, she knew they were not good people. She quickly turned around and told her aunt, Ms. Shen (38 years old), who quickly climbed onto the drying terrace on the roof, crossed over to the terrace at No. 9 next door, and ran down, intending to go out and use the telephone to report to the police. The neighbor noticed that she looked flustered, fearing that she was about to commit suicide, so he followed and asked her, and at the same time knocked on the back door to notify her children and grandchildren to prevent unexpected events from happening. At this time, the robbers in the room were driving the two apprentices to the attic on the second floor. Two robbers broke into the pavilion and grabbed more than 50 yuan in cash from the drawer of the desk, intending to intimidate the owner, Zhu Xinfen, and force him to hand over the key to the safe. One of the robbers on the stairs

Gunfire Erupts, One Robber Killed
At that time, Huang Jinyao, an apprentice from the Chengda Rice Mill, had a bicycle still placed in the patio, which one of the robbers rode away. When the robbers went out, the two apprentices followed behind. As soon as they went out of the lane, Huang Jinyao blew the whistle. Nearby police officers heard the alarm and gathered from all directions to surround and arrest the robbers. The robbers knew they had been exposed, so they turned into Meibike Road from Shanhai Pass Road and fled to Aiwengi Road. The police officers chasing from behind were close behind. Two police officers standing opposite the Xinzha Police Station also assisted in the arrest. The robbers took the initiative to fire their guns to resist arrest. The police also fired back. It is reported that Police Officer No. 811 fired four shots, No. 2702 fired five shots, No. 1384 fired four shots, and No. 2351 fired six shots. Gunfire erupted for a while, and passersby fled in panic. As a result, one robber dressed in a gray suit was shot six times by the police. All the shots hit vital points and he fell to the ground and died immediately.

One Killed by Stray Bullet, Four Injured in Total
When the robbers and police officers were fighting, stray bullets flew around, killing and injuring five men and women. One old woman, in her fifties, was shot in the left rib, penetrating the right rib, and died on the spot, falling in front of the Jixiangtai Teahouse at Nos. 301-2.

When the reporter rushed to investigate, he saw blood splattered everywhere and the smell was pungent. At the same time, after the police officers bravely arrested the robbers, they arrested three robbers on the spot and detained them in the Xinzha Police Station for investigation. The four people injured by stray bullets were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The bodies of the two men and women were sent to the coroner's office for examination. The body of the old woman who was killed by mistake was photographed to wait for her family to claim it.

The Police Department

Reported to the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office, and the coffin was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan branch,

And an autopsy was performed, and it was determined that she had died of "acute heart failure." However, when the deceased died suddenly, Lu and Lin did not report to the police station in accordance with the regulations of the concession hospitals, so there was a suspicion of falsifying the certificate.

Reasons for Prosecution Were Not Stated in Detail, but Were Vague and Ambiguous, So the First Instance's Judgment of Not Guilty Was Quite Appropriate. They Also Presented a Precedent from the Supreme Court for the Court to Refer to. The Court then Interrogated the Two Defendants, Lu and Lin, and Li Shizhen, and Then Concluded That the Case Still Needed to Be Investigated and Rescheduled for Hearing.

### Father of British Ambassador's Wife - Short Trip to China - Praises Shanghai's Vibrancy - Particularly Fond of Beiping

The *North-China Daily News* reports that Mr. Lee赖氏, the father of Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China's wife (i.e., the Ambassador's wife), is a renowned lawyer from Chile, South America. He recently arrived in Shanghai to visit his daughter. According to Mr. Lee, whom the reporter interviewed, among the cities he has seen, Shanghai is the most vibrant, surpassing even New York. He is deeply interested in the lives of the Chinese people. Before coming to Shanghai, he briefly resided in Beiping, viewing the scenery, but soon departed, much to his regret. He originally intended to stay in Shanghai for several days before embarking on a global tour, but due to the current situation, he had to hastily begin his journey. He will depart tomorrow (6th) on the President Coolidge for South America.

### Negotiations for Goods Returned from Vietnam to Shanghai - Handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Previously, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, due to the Vietnamese authorities' cancellation of permits for Chinese goods in transit returning from Hong Kong to Shanghai, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Consulate in Saigon, and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to vigorously advocate for the restoration of these permits. The Chamber has now received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that the matter has been forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review and direct response.

### French Concession Water and Electricity Increase Prices Again - Still Hoping for Prevention - Company Has Annual Surplus - Merchants and Residents Can't Bear the Burden

The French-owned Water and Electricity Company of this city, in October of last year, citing foreign exchange shortages and rising prices, increased electricity rates by 60%, water rates by 10%, and tram and bus fares by 17%. The general populace found the increased burden difficult to bear. Recently, the company, again citing increased expenses, submitted a request to the French Municipal Council at the end of last month to increase prices. The Board of Directors of the Council discussed and approved it.

After receiving this approval, the company invalidated all previous fee schedules yesterday and announced new prices as follows: The electricity rates for lighting, power, and heating increased by 97% (including the previous 60% increase); water rates increased by 30% (including the previous 10%). The two items above were to be implemented today, following the new prices. As for the fare increase for trams, trolleybuses, and buses, the company has submitted the original prices and proposed increase tables to the French Municipal Council. The Council is currently

still reviewing these, with approval expected around the 10th of this month. The exact increase amount is unknown but will be posted on each vehicle two days before implementation to inform the public. The reason given by the company for this increase in water and electricity fares is that the cost of living has recently risen, employee subsidies have increased, and gasoline and rubber prices have soared. The current increases are still lower than those in the International Settlement, but the general populace believes that the company has had excellent business and significant surpluses in recent years and hopes that the authorities can prevent the increases so that the residents of the French Concession do not find life even more difficult.

### Over 200 More American Nationals - Depart Shanghai Tomorrow Morning to Return Home - President Coolidge Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon - Plenty of Cabin Space on Two Other Special Vessels

The American President Lines' President Coolidge, arriving from Manila via Hong Kong on its journey back to the US, docked at buoys 11 and 12 in the Huangpu River at 5 PM yesterday. It is reported that over 70 people disembarked in Shanghai, while the rest were mostly American nationals evacuating from various parts of the Far East. According to the shipping company, the Coolidge is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow morning, heading for Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and then San Francisco. Over 200 American nationals from this port are evacuating on this vessel.

Two More Vessels - Dedicated to Evacuation

It is also said that the second evacuation vessel, the Mariposa, will leave Shanghai on the 10th, and the third, the Washington, is scheduled to leave on the 21st. These two vessels will exclusively carry evacuating American nationals back to the US, and it is expected that there will be very few empty seats. There is currently some space available in the first-class cabins of the Mariposa and the second and third-class cabins of the Washington. Most of the second and third-class cabins on the Mariposa have been pre-booked by American nationals from North China and Korea. After leaving Shanghai, the Mariposa will travel via North China and Korea, it is said. It is also understood that American nationals will also be evacuating on the Japanese NYK Line's Kazan Maru, sailing from Shanghai to San Francisco on the 15th of this month.

Some American Nationals - Requesting Assistance

According to the US Consulate General, they have received inquiries from 25 American nationals expressing a need for government assistance to purchase passage home. It is expected that the total will reach 150 people, but some of them will only request partial assistance. The Consulate will conduct investigations into those requesting assistance to ensure prudence. Therefore, the Consulate cannot act hastily, but will ensure that genuinely impoverished American nationals can return home on American President Lines vessels within the next few weeks. According to an official, "We are following the State Department's policy and are very willing to see non-essential American nationals leave Shanghai, but we are determined not to adopt incentives to encourage their evacuation."

### Soviet Nationals to Celebrate Tomorrow - October Revolution Anniversary - Grand Celebrations to be Held for Five Consecutive Days - With Two Screenings of Award-Winning Feature Films

Tomorrow marks the 23rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. As the Soviet-埃 General Association at 805 Avenue Foch is too small, Soviet nationals will hold a grand celebration at the YWCA on Bubbling Well Road, including dancing, music, and film screenings. The celebration will last for five consecutive days. As the Soviet Union has no diplomatic representation in Shanghai, there will be no receptions for foreign guests and nationals. The schedule for the five-day celebration is as follows: Tomorrow at 9 PM, Soviet nationals will hold a special meeting, followed by a lecture, a concert, and a grand dance party. On Friday (the 8th) at 9 PM, Soviet newsreels and the recently released Soviet "award-winning" film will be screened. On Saturday (the 9th), the award-winning film "Lenin in 1918" will be screened. On Sunday (the 9th) at 3 PM, a children's matinee film will be screened. On Monday (the 11th), there will be another concert and dance party.

### Acceptance, Discount, and Rediscount - Not Implemented in Shanghai

After the Ministry of Finance announced the provisional measures for promoting bank acceptance and discount business, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and local bankers' associations have been ordered to comply. Regarding the Shanghai Settlement area, there has long been the establishment of a bank note acceptance office, handling bank acceptance note business, which is unrelated to the measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. The reason is that Shanghai's situation is unique, so it will not be implemented for the time being. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China accepting rediscounts will also be postponed in Shanghai.
