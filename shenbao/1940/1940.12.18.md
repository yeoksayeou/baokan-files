### US Reviewing Pacific Situation: Naval Garrison to Remain in Hawaii, Prepared to Respond to Crises in East and West at Any Time; Navy Department Agrees to Strengthen Asian Fleet

Washington: Authoritative sources stated yesterday that after a review of the naval situation in the Pacific by senior naval commanders, a decision has been made to recommend that the US Hawaiian Fleet be maintained indefinitely and prepared to operate in both the East and West at any time. Senior naval commanders advocate that the fleet maintain considerable operating distance between the Caribbean and the Far East. They stated that the best way to achieve this objective is to keep the fleet stationed in Hawaii. There had been prior proposals to move the fleet to western bases in the Far East and the Caribbean, but these were rejected pending diplomatic progress. Well-informed sources solemnly declared that the Navy's review of this decision did not aim to address the international naval and diplomatic issues of the highest administrative officials. The prevailing view is to station the fleet in a location from which it can enter the Atlantic at any time, so as to respond should adverse situations arise there. At the same time, the Navy Department does not oppose strengthening the Asian Fleet, in order to demonstrate the United States' unchanging attitude towards Japan in the Far East. The Navy's strategy is to use submarine forces based in Manila, aided by air power, to jeopardize Japan's supply lines to the Dutch East Indies in the event of formal conflict. However, diplomatic circles believe that the United States' current Far Eastern policy is based solely on moral issues, and the United States will not take any public action unless Japan initiates actions.

Lyon: US foreign policy has recently been commented on by *The Times*, stating that at a time when important financial negotiations are underway between Britain and the United States, following the death of British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian, US President Roosevelt met with the Duke of Windsor, Governor-General of the Bahamas, and dispatched a special envoy, Colonel Donovan, to London. Furthermore, President Roosevelt's message to Congress, to be submitted next spring, is being drafted. All these urgent and critical developments have once again made US political activities the focus of global attention. Judging from the known facts, US foreign policy will likely continue to follow its current course and will not undergo any changes before the next session of Congress. The goal of the large-scale expansion of US military strength is only to strengthen the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Regarding all wars that do not directly affect US interests, the United States will continue to avoid involvement in the vortex. The meeting between the Duke of Windsor and President Roosevelt is unlikely to have any impact on Anglo-American relations. Colonel Donovan's trip to Europe is solely to inspect the European situation and report to President Roosevelt, so that the President can determine policy from an "American perspective." That is all.

### Military Port Construction Commences in Bermuda, Complete with Coastal Artillery Installations

New York: Construction has begun on the US naval base in Bermuda. Construction personnel will arrive within three months. The US destroyer "Biddle" has docked in Hamilton Harbor, and three US bombers are conducting regular test flights. According to a special correspondent of the *Tribune*, the military port, once completed, will be able to accommodate warships and naval aircraft, and will include coastal artillery batteries, barracks, arsenals, and other necessary facilities. It will be able to garrison at least 4,500 troops, and with the addition of military dependents, the population will increase by 20 percent. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### Britain Requests Economic Assistance from the United States; Nature and Quantity Undisclosed; Mrs. Roosevelt Advocates Granting Funds to Britain; Britain to Purchase Twenty-Four Old US Merchant Ships

Washington: Senior US officials stated yesterday that Britain has formally requested economic assistance from the United States to resist Germany and Italy. British financial expert [John Maynard] Keynes is negotiating with US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and has requested assistance; however, the nature and quantity of assistance are unknown. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Washington: When reporters inquired about the news that Britain had formally requested economic assistance from the United States, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau replied that the reporters had obtained accurate information. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Washington: During a reception for reporters yesterday, Mrs. Roosevelt stated that the United States should provide Britain with cash grants, rather than loans. When asked where these grants would come from, Mrs. Roosevelt replied, "From the government, and ultimately from your and my pockets." Some Americans believe that we are currently aiding Britain, but it is important to understand that we must deal with reality. We do not assist Britain without gaining something. Cash grants, compared to loans, are less likely to draw the United States into war. The supplies the United States sends to Britain greatly benefit the United States, as they support the industries needed for US national defense. We see no reason to negotiate loans. We should not repeat the mistakes of the past." When reporters asked if she was referring to the unpaid war debts, Mrs. Roosevelt nodded her head slightly. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Washington: The US Maritime Commission announced yesterday that twenty-four old merchant ships will be sold on January 7. It is widely expected that the British Purchasing Commission in the United States will bid for them. It is reported that the ships for sale vary in tonnage, from less than 8,000 tons to 23,000 tons, such as the former German ship *George Washington*. The terms of sale stipulate that these ships must be transferred to foreign merchants within six months. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London: Official sources here, in commenting on the statement issued by New York last night regarding the discussions in Washington, stated that Britain's financial position and the entire issue of US aid are not independent in nature, but are directly related to Britain's need to purchase aircraft, ships, military equipment, and other raw materials from the United States. The aforementioned statement issued by New York stated, according to London sources, that the British government has formally requested financial aid from the US government, and that this aid need not necessarily take the form of loans. Britain's use of various supplies received from the United States will continue to increase. The British government naturally seeks to maximize the use of America's vast resources. This desire is clearly the basis for the issues discussed by British Treasury representative Phillips during his visit to the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Lloyd George Rumored to Enter Cabinet, to Serve as Minister Without Portfolio; US Ambassador Position Undecided

London: A Reuters parliamentary correspondent reported that Lloyd George, who served as British Prime Minister during the World War, visited British Prime Minister Churchill at 10 Downing Street yesterday, which has sparked speculation. Some suggest that Lloyd George may be appointed as the British Ambassador to the United States. However, this is unlikely to materialize, while George joining Churchill's government soon is not impossible. Before serving as Prime Minister in the last World War, George was the Minister of Munitions. If George enters the cabinet in this war, he may serve as a Minister Without Portfolio, rather than heading any specific department, as George can leverage his rich experience more effectively as a Minister Without Portfolio than as the head of any department. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London: News today from here indicates that Lord Astor is a leading candidate to succeed as the US Ambassador. Lady Astor is Nancy Langhorne, born in Virginia. It is widely expected that if Lloyd George refuses to accept the position, Astor may receive it. However, these are all speculations. There is also talk that Secretary of War Eden will be transferred to the US Ambassador position. (International News Service dispatch, 17th)

Washington: Federal Security Administrator McNutt's attendance at Ambassador Lothian's funeral on Sunday sparked rumors yesterday that he might succeed Kennedy as the US Ambassador to Britain. However, McNutt stated that he has no intention of taking on this role. Apart from State Department officials, McNutt was the highest-ranking US official to attend the funeral. He stated that he attended the funeral because he had a close personal relationship with Ambassador Lothian. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Construction of Nicaragua Canal Planned; US Senator Claims Decision Made

Mexico City: US Senator Reynolds stated here yesterday that a plan to construct the Nicaragua Canal has been largely decided. This has a significant relationship to the defense of the American continent. However, the implementation of construction will depend on the development of the European war situation. Reynolds is currently on a goodwill tour of Central American countries. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### British Treasury Requisitions Sixty Types of US Securities

London: The British Treasury announced today that it is requisitioning sixty types of US securities, including major stocks on the market and several preferred stocks from companies such as General Motors, Kodak, Goodyear Tire, Mobil Oil, and Pennsylvania Railroad. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Restrictions on Japanese Business Imposed in Various Parts of Canada in Retaliation for Hostile Actions Against Britons; Ban on Lead Exports to Japan Expected

Vancouver: According to news received here, Japan's hostility toward British interests in the Far East has sparked anti-Japanese sentiment in Canada. This is particularly true in British Columbia, where Japanese immigrants occupy positions in several industries and businesses. Canadians are increasingly dissatisfied with the fact that Japanese have become formidable competitors in their own markets. Seeing Japan allied with the Axis powers has further fueled their resentment. Japanese immigrants entering Canada are subject to the Gentlemen's Agreement, which allows 150 Japanese individuals to enter each year, while Chinese immigrants are generally denied entry, except for a few explicitly stipulated cases. Considering British interests in the Far East, Canada has generally adopted a very lenient policy towards Japan. However, recent events will cause Canada to adopt a stronger stance to reject further Japanese encroachment. Japanese immigrants began entering British Columbia in 1880 and have since prospered. Today, almost all of the fruit production in several key areas is controlled by Japanese individuals. Farmland with the most fertile soil along the Fraser River is also occasionally occupied by Japanese individuals, and hundreds of retail stores and half of the laundry businesses in Vancouver are operated by Japanese individuals. The activities of Japanese individuals in the fishing industry along the North American Pacific coastline are particularly prominent, and British Columbia has had to impose restrictions to prevent Caucasian fishing interests from being completely taken over by Japanese individuals. However, Japanese individuals remain an important factor in the fishing industry. The Vancouver City Council recently proposed adopting similar restrictions to prevent Japanese businesses from obtaining business licenses exceeding a ratio of one business per ten households. Japanese individuals also have interests in the lumber and mining industries, but these are not significant. Japanese merchants fell trees and sell them without sawing them open within Canada or turning them into pulp. Therefore, Canadian sawmills are greatly dissatisfied with this trend of Japanese merchants. Japanese individuals previously operated a copper mine, but before the government banned exports, the Japanese government purchased most of the copper it needed from a mine operated by Americans. Currently, exports of scrap metal, nickel, and aluminum are prohibited, and a ban on Canadian lead exports is also expected. All of this is clear evidence that Canada's attitude towards Japan is stronger than before. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Japan to Control International Trade

Tokyo: To intensify wartime controls, the Japanese government has decided to invoke provisions of the National General Mobilization Law to uniformly control international trade with all countries. Ministers without portfolio will have the authority to prohibit or designate which goods should be exported. Japanese Prime Minister Konoe stated that controlling foreign trade and controlling speech and news are necessary steps for complete national defense. Since the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, Japan's situation has become extremely difficult. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Japanese Ambassador to the United States to Take Office Next Month; Will Visit China Before Departing

Editorial

### Japan's Several International Challenges

Japan's recent actions and attitudes clearly reveal its extreme hesitation and wavering regarding the specific challenges it faces. The root cause is naturally that the monumental task of establishing the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is entirely beyond Japan's capabilities. However, how it will address these challenges in its ongoing reckless pursuit of this goal is worthy of great attention today.

1.  The Issue of Blocking the Yunnan-Burma International Route: In July of this year, when Japan demanded that Britain close the Burma Road, it made a great show of force, threatening to join the German-Italian alliance on one hand and assembling troops to threaten direct action on the other. At that time, Britain's circumstances were dire, so it announced a three-month blockade. This was greeted with jubilation in Japan, as if it had found a shortcut to resolving the so-called "Sino-Japanese Incident." As the three months drew to a close, the German-Italian-Japanese alliance was formally announced, and Britain, encouraged by the United States, decided to reopen the Burma Road. Japan once again displayed various gestures and threats against Britain and the United States. Therefore, when Britain reopened the road as scheduled on October 18, Japan not only suffered a blow to the progress of the war against China, but also suffered a setback in its international prestige. As a result, it clamored across the country and could only declare that it had sufficient strength to launch large-scale bombing raids and completely destroy the road. However, two months have passed since then, and apart from occasional ineffective bombings, nothing else has happened. Meanwhile, international transport on this road is continuous, day and night, and has not been hindered in the slightest. Whether this is due to the inadequacy of Japan's air power or the fact that China is strong enough to protect it is not the main point. The key point is that in due course, when the Yunnan-Burma Railway is completed, China's transportation will become even more frequent and convenient. Japan's attempt to disrupt China's southwestern lifeline and cut off China's connection with Britain and the United States has been disproven by the facts, demonstrating Japan's failure.

2.  The Issue of Southern Advance: When Japan invaded Vietnam at the end of September, it used the pretext of attacking Yunnan and Guangxi; in reality, it was beginning its southern advance, both to restrain a portion of the British fleet for Germany and Italy and to completely occupy Vietnam in terms of military affairs, economy, and politics. The strong reaction was beyond its expectations. Britain and the United States immediately formed a defense line in the South Seas region, preparing for battle. Japan's so-called southern advance dared not be reckless. Of course, it is waiting for Germany and Italy to give Britain a major blow before it begins to act. Therefore, there is a question here: If the European war continues to drag on without a clear winner, and the Anglo-American joint defense becomes increasingly sound, will Japan continue to be restrained? Or will it take action soon? Japan itself must answer this question within the next few months.

3.  The Issue of US-Japan Relations: Since October, due to the United States' clear opposition to the "New Order" and repeated actions to strike at Japan, it has raised an urgent question for Japan: What will be the guiding principles of future US-Japan relations? When the United States expressed its determination to deal with contingencies and withdrew its expatriates from the Far East, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka issued a warning: If the United States opposes or hinders Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," then a future war between the United States and Japan will be unavoidable. The US authorities then immediately declared that they accepted Japan's challenge. Immediately afterwards, Japan fundamentally denied that Matsuoka had ever made such remarks, attributing it entirely to a misunderstanding by the Associated Press. In fact, under the pressure of the United States' gradual pressure on Japan, Japan has appointed Nomura as the Ambassador to the United States, attempting to adjust diplomatic relations with the United States. However, it was soon met with opposition from public opinion across the country. This shows that the entire nation of Japan has entered a state of confusion regarding the future guiding principles of US-Japan relations. If these principles cannot be formed and fixed soon, or if Japan decides against the principles respected by the United States, then how will Japan withstand the international pressure in diplomatic and economic areas?

4.  The Issue of Adjusting Relations with the Soviet Union: Japan's appointment of Tatekawa as the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, with the intention of so-called "adjusting relations with the Soviet Union," involves no more than two aspects: the first is to conclude a non-aggression pact, and the second is to demand that the Soviet Union stop aiding China. It is imagined that the exchange conditions Japan offered would naturally be to automatically oppose Britain and the United States and begin its southern advance. The opposite is true. Japan, in order to express its "goodwill" to the Soviet Union on the Afghanistan issue, instead aroused the Soviet Union's solemn declaration that its position on China would not change. As a result, Japan's diplomacy toward the Soviet Union has fallen into a difficult situation, neither breaking this deadlock nor being able to escape the danger of its fundamental international bankruptcy.

5.  The Issue Created by British and American Economic Aid to China: In the past month or so, Britain and the United States have successively announced large-scale and planned economic aid to China. The most important significance of this is to offset all of Japan's efforts to weaken China economically, militarily, and in terms of morale; it is clearly telling Japan that no matter how hard it works on the war against China, the result will be in vain. The reaction to this in Japan, apart from the external spokesman Suma's so-called "British and American economic aid to China may also indirectly benefit Japan," as a self-deprecating remark, has not yet come up with any effective retaliatory measures against Britain and the United States.

6.  The Most Serious Issue: The most serious challenge facing Japan is still the fact that its military strength is becoming increasingly outdated in international comparisons. In addition to the growing strength of China's new forces day by day, the Soviet Union's large-scale expansion of the Red Army and the United States' active manufacture of aircraft and fleets are Japan's most critical threats. Japan, which has been at war for more than three years, is absolutely unable to compete with them in any way. If Japan dares not take the risk and make a final stand soon, it can only honestly admit that it has indeed failed completely. A dark shadow looms over Japan, causing it to be drowsy and unself-aware, and also causing it to be confused and still want to make a desperate gamble!

### Foreign Minister Wang Delivers Speech, Elaborating China's Diplomatic Policy

Chongqing: Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui gave a report on "The Latest International Situation and China's Diplomacy" at the Central Memorial Weekly Meeting on the morning of the 16th. The original text is recorded below: (1) The significance of the Tripartite Pact: Japan's joining of the German-Italian alliance aims, according to Article 3 of the pact, to ensure that if one of the three countries is attacked by a country that has not yet participated in the European war or the Sino-Japanese conflict, they should provide mutual assistance in politics, economics, and military affairs. This is clearly intended to threaten the Soviet Union and intimidate the United States. The pact has a reservation in Article 5 regarding the Soviet Union, namely that the existing political status between any of the three countries and the Soviet Union is not affected in any way, but there is no explicit reservation regarding the United States. This point is worthy of our attention. After the signing of the pact, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka repeatedly stated that they would not hesitate to fight the United States. Subsequently, because the United States' Far East policy not only did not weaken but became even stronger, and even Secretary of the Navy Knox declared that the United States was prepared to accept Japan's provocation, Konoe and Matsuoka denied that they had made provocative remarks against the United States. On the one hand, they repeatedly explained to the United States that the pact was not directed against the United States; on the other hand, they explained that Article 5 of the pact already had an explicit reservation regarding the Soviet Union and was therefore not directed against the Soviet Union. The United States, knowing that the Tripartite Pact would be signed soon, preemptively granted China a loan of $25 million a day earlier. After the signing, the United States further imposed an embargo on scrap steel and scrap iron on Japan, stepped up the construction of a two-ocean navy, strengthened its Far East defenses, conducted negotiations on a joint defense in the South Pacific, and advised the withdrawal of overseas Chinese in the Far East to return to the United States. At the same time, Britain's policy in the Far East has also been strengthened, such as reopening the Burma Road and continuing to provide China with transportation and transit facilities. (2) After the signing of the pact, China's friendly nations, the United States and Britain, successively expressed their strong opposition. At the same time, the friendly nations stepped up their efforts to restrain Japan while expanding their assistance to China, providing China with strong material and financial aid. This is worthy of our gratitude. (3) The way of diplomacy: when talking about "those who are virtuous receive much assistance," we must trace back to the fundamental diplomatic concepts indicated in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. According to what is stated in the Preface to the Three Principles of the People, "Diplomatic Policy" was originally listed in the book "National Reconstruction." Now, many are scattered in the Last Will, and I will select a few fundamental viewpoints to share with my comrades. There are three main diplomatic principles: A. Non-exclusivity, B. Anti-aggression, and C. Equal international status. A. Non-exclusivity: Inaugural declaration of the Provisional President, January 1, Republic of China Year 1 (omitted above) "The actions and xenophobic mentality of the Manchu Qing era must be completely eliminated" (omitted below). Lecture 1 on Nationalism (omitted above) "Nationalism does not mean that we should reject people of similar races; it means that we should not allow people of different races to seize our national power" (omitted below). B. Anti-aggression: Clause 4 of the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction (omitted above) "The government should resist foreign aggression and powerful forces" (omitted below). It should be known that non-exclusivity and anti-aggression are two sides of the same coin. While we are not exclusive, we must resist if we encounter foreign aggression. The role of nationalism lies in maintaining the survival and independence of our nation, and what we must strive for in practice is anti-aggression. At present, we are fighting the war of resistance, on the one hand resisting aggression to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of "anti-aggression" and on the other hand maintaining "non-exclusivity" as our stance, and we should strive to further enhance the existing friendship with all countries in the world in order to expand their sympathy for us. C. Equal international status: Clause 4 of the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction (omitted above) "At the same time, revise treaties with various countries to restore our equal international status 'national independence'" (omitted below). Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Last Will (omitted above) "Recently, there have been proposals to convene a national assembly and abolish unequal treaties, which must be realized in the shortest possible time." While we are not exclusive and anti-aggressive, we aim to eliminate China's status as a "quasi-colony" and achieve an equal international status. As for the method we adopt, it lies in abolishing unequal treaties. Regarding the abolition of unequal treaties, President Chiang Kai-shek had a noteworthy point in his speech refuting Konoe's statement on December 26, 1938, which is quoted below (omitted above). "The spirit of our Chinese nation is to not insult the widowed and orphaned and not fear the strong; certainly, we will not betray our promises and destroy the justice that maintains humanity." I remember that in the early years of the Republic of China, Tanaka Giichi came to Shanghai to meet with our Premier. At that time, it was during the outbreak of the European War. Tanaka said, "We in East Asia should break away from all existing relations with foreign countries and establish a new system." The Premier asked him, "Wouldn't this destroy international treaties?" Tanaka said, "Isn't destroying international treaties and breaking unequal relations very beneficial to China?" The Premier resolutely rejected him, saying, "The abolition of unequal treaties should also be done openly and justly through legal and proper procedures. If we destroy treaties illegally, even if this action is beneficial to our country, we will not do it." Fellow comrades, this is the spirit of China, this is the spirit of the Three Principles of the People (omitted below). (4) The prospect of abolishing unequal treaties: In the process of China abolishing unequal treaties, the Soviet Union had already declared in 1917 that it would automatically renounce all unequal treaties and privileges towards us. As for the United States and Britain, they have also expressed sincere intentions in recent years, as briefly described below. U.S. Note to Japan, December 21, 1938 (omitted above) "As early as 1931, including that year, all countries that should have this right in China (i.e., extraterritoriality), including the United States, were actively negotiating and preparing to renounce this right, and considerable progress had already been made" (omitted below). U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles stated on July 20 of this year: "The United States is willing to continue negotiations with China under peaceful conditions to abolish extraterritoriality." British Prime Minister Churchill also made this statement in the House of Commons. In a note from the British government to Japan on January 14, 1939, it was stated that "Britain is prepared, after the end of the war, to negotiate with the Chinese government on the abolition of extraterritoriality, the return of concessions, and the revision of treaties based on the principles of reciprocity and equality" (16th dispatch).

### Resolving Border Disputes, Thailand Proposes Peace Suggestion, Official Note Sent to French Government Authorities, Requesting Further Dispatch of Border Committee

Jinta City: The 65-year-old King of Cambodia, Monivong, stated in a statement issued to foreign reporters in his capital last night: "Cambodia and its King have a stronger and more united relationship with France than before. "King Monivong resides in the gold-roofed palace in New York, surrounded by sandbags. His foreign minister conveyed the statement to reporters from the United Press because he was ill and unable to meet them in person. King Monivong's statement stated, "Due to the current situation, Cambodia and its King have a stronger and more united relationship with France than before. The French Empire saved Cambodia from destruction. Over the past seventy years, France has provided great assistance to our country's peace and progress. The Cambodian people and their King are not only completely loyal to France but also have the heartfelt love of a child for its kind mother. We unanimously assure France that we will cooperate to defend the sacred land of Cambodia" (Taiwan News Agency dispatch, 17th).

### British Troops' Vanguard Crosses 20 Miles Beyond Bardia - Fierce Fighting Near Fort Capuzzo - 75,000 Italian Soldiers Now Captured

Cairo - Following the report of British forces occupying Fort Capuzzo and Sollum, further battle reports state that British mechanized units are currently engaged in combat with Italian forces at Bardia. Although the Italians are putting up fierce resistance, the British forces' flanking maneuvers have crossed 20 miles beyond the city in several places. The British Air Force continues to cooperate with ground troops, heavily bombing the Italian army's retreat routes along the coast and fiercely attacking Bardia. (Reuter's dispatch, 17th)

London - According to news received here today, the fall of Bardia, the easternmost port in Italian Libya, seems imminent. British forces are closely pursuing the retreating Italian army after occupying Fort Capuzzo. Official announcements from Cairo state that the capture of Fort Capuzzo marks the peak of British blitzkrieg tactics. Within eight days, British forces have completely driven the Italian army out of Egypt. A Turkish wireless message states that the British vanguard has crossed over 20 miles beyond Bardia. Official reports state that Bardia is under attack by mechanized units, and British forces are currently pursuing the Italian army. The British Air Force again heavily bombed Bardia and the coastal areas yesterday. Currently, the front lines are experiencing rainfall, which is somewhat hindering air operations, but this is not expected to last long. After three days of intense fighting, the British Air Force conquered Sollum and Fort Capuzzo yesterday. Major General Klaye led the British forces in the capture of Sollum. (Reuter's dispatch, 17th)

London - According to news received here today, the battles in the Fort Capuzzo and Sollum area in Libya are still ongoing. Some Australian and New Zealand troops are currently participating in these battles. The capture of Sollum has provided British forces with a small deep-water port, allowing ships to approach closer. Unfortunately, the port lacks railway facilities. Bardia has suffered heavy losses from British naval bombardment. Among the British forces entering Libya are several excellent volunteers who have resided in Egypt for a long time and are familiar with the situation. Today, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax stated that these volunteers are extremely valuable and will deal a significant blow to the enemy. (Reuter's dispatch, 17th)

Cairo - Official announcements formally declare that British forces in the desert region have occupied Sollum and the strategically important Italian Fort Capuzzo on the border. The British vanguard is currently engaged in intense fighting in the Sollum, Bardia, and Fort Capuzzo area. Part of the force has invaded Italian Libyan territory and is closely pursuing the Italian army. Heavy rains have followed the vast desert in this region, making visibility extremely poor. It is claimed that 75,000 Italian soldiers have been captured. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Cairo - Following the British offensive in the western desert, within two weeks, the Italian army has been driven out of its last stronghold in Egyptian territory, Sollum. Fort Capuzzo, with its strong defenses (located several miles inside the Libyan border), has also been occupied by British forces. It is noted that Italian and British forces engaged in fierce fighting at Fort Capuzzo several times this summer, gaining and losing it repeatedly. During the British assault on Fort Capuzzo, British and Italian forces also fought for the Halfaya Pass, which winds through the slopes controlling Sollum. British forces captured the pass after a surprise attack on an Italian camp on the summit. The British occupation of Sollum is a significant factor in the continuation of the war, as ships can now approach closer to the coast to unload supplies. At the same time, the British Air Force continues to bomb Italian bases, including Bardia, which is expected to be the next target of a determined British assault. (Reuter's dispatch, 17th)

British Air Force Conducts Extensive Operations - Naples Heavily Bombed

Cairo - A communique from the British Air Force headquarters in the Middle East states that British long-range bombers heavily attacked the port of Naples in Italy on Saturday night with considerable success. Bombs were dropped on cruisers and destroyers concentrated in the port, scoring five hits, causing four explosions. The dock where two battleships were moored was bombed and caught fire. A British aircraft dropped all its bombs near an enemy battleship. Simultaneously, the airfield was also attacked and caught fire. All British aircraft returned safely. Braving severe weather, the British Air Force continued to attack enemy airfields in the western desert. British fighter planes continued to patrol, covering the British vanguard. Fighter planes also carried out offensive patrols over a wide area, reaching as far as Tobruk and El Adem. Bardia was bombed and caught fire, burning fiercely. The docks were hit and suffered significant damage. On Sunday, British aircraft flew to Benghazi, Apollonia, and Cyrene to bomb, shooting down two Italian aircraft. There were no British losses. Gora in East Africa was attacked by British aircraft at night. The airfield and hangars were hit. That night, British aircraft also bombed Sora, Gondar, Asmara, and Bahr Dar. Buildings inside and outside the Asmara airfield were hit and caught fire. On Saturday night and Sunday, Italian aircraft attempted to attack Malta, but there was no material damage or loss of life.

Western Desert Battlefield Inspection - Blackshirt Corpses Litter the Landscape

London - A correspondent currently accompanying British forces has reported details of the British advance into Libya. Although it is still too early, according to Captain Roll, an Australian military photographer accompanying the British Imperial forces in the Western Desert offensive, their group advanced 20 miles from the British base, encountering no enemy soldiers along the way. They then moved north towards Sidi Barrani, where they witnessed a shocking scene. Italian soldiers' corpses were scattered everywhere. They also saw a detention camp with 7,000 to 8,000 Italian soldiers inside, enjoying comfortable living conditions. South of Sidi Barrani, they saw an Italian military camp in extreme disarray, with abandoned weapons lying all over the place. They saw several gasoline depots in the desert for refueling, as well as numerous food warehouses. The British forces have ample supplies and are currently using captured Italian military trucks for all transportation purposes. When Mr. Hall and others arrived in Sidi Barrani, they found the area had been reduced to rubble by British naval bombardment. (Reuter's dispatch, 17th)

### Cunningham to be Appointed - British Naval Commander-in-Chief

London - Naval circles here widely believe that Admiral Cunningham, the British Mediterranean Naval Commander-in-Chief, will be appointed as British Naval Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Naval Staff, replacing the current incumbent, Dudley Pound. Recent sharp increases in British ship losses at sea have caused great anxiety within the British Cabinet. Cunningham's repeated successes in the Mediterranean have led many naval experts to believe that only he is capable of effectively countering German submarines. The leading candidates to fill Cunningham's vacancy are Vice-Admiral Horton and Admiral Harwood. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Italian War Report

An enemy aircraft attacked Dire Dawa yesterday morning and was shot down by an Italian fighter plane. Italian aircraft also shot down an enemy aircraft on the 15th. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

### Danube River Freezes - Navigation Closed - Romanian Oil Transport to Germany Blocked

London - The Danube River has now frozen, so the main route for transporting Romanian oil and other goods to Germany may be temporarily closed until March next year. According to news received from the Southern capital by London newspapers, the Southern River Transport Administration has ordered the suspension of Danube River navigation from yesterday. All ships are to remain in port for the winter. It is expected that other countries along the Danube River will follow suit in the next few days. (Reuter's dispatch, 17th)

Southern Capital - Yugoslavia has been experiencing severe cold weather recently. The temperature in the Bosnian mountains is 20 degrees below freezing. The temperature here yesterday was 11 degrees Celsius below zero. The Danube River and other rivers within Yugoslavia have mostly frozen, bringing navigation to a standstill. This is having a significant impact on Yugoslavia's export trade, as large quantities of grain must be transported to Germany via the Danube River. At the same time, heavy snowfall has disrupted railway and telephone communications in many areas. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### In a Snowstorm, Greek Forces Advance Steadily - Dividing Forces into Two Routes for Advance - Seven Italian Counterattacks Repelled

Athens - A government spokesperson has announced that Greek soldiers continued to make astonishing progress yesterday in the Këlcyrë and Tepelenë areas. Greek forces, fighting bravely with hand grenades, bayonets, and knives, have entered Mount Skërvica, 20 kilometers northwest of Argyrokastron, and have occupied the highest peak of the mountain, controlling this particular battlefield. The Italian army launched several divisions of its newest equipped troops in fierce counterattacks, totaling seven counterattacks. However, the results were still heavy losses and retreat, and 200 people were captured by the Greek army. In the snow-covered Këlcyrë and Tepelenë front lines, Italian and Greek forces fought hand-to-hand, with Greek forces advancing steadily in the heavy snow. According to Greek radio, Greek forces on the southern front also occupied several new positions and discovered the bodies of an Italian general, a major, and many other Italian officers. According to captured Italian soldiers, the people of Vlorë are retreating, and the families of all fascist leaders in Albania have begun to leave Albania and move to Italy, as they believe the situation in Albania has reached its most serious state. Yesterday's Greek victory, continuing to advance and approaching Vlorë, will likely make the Italians and fascists in Albania feel that this place is uninhabitable and wish to move to a better place. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Stuarts - Greek soldiers, after assaulting the outskirts of Tepelenë for six hours, completely drove out the Italian forces defending the important military town, entering the city at 10:00 AM and clearing the surrounding Italian forces by 4:00 PM. Tepelenë is the gateway to Vlorë, only 27 miles from the port. The Greek army had previously launched two fierce attacks on the city, both of which failed. The Italian army is now retreating north towards the Pindus Mountains, failing to block the highway to Vlorë. At the same time, after occupying Këlcyrë, Greek forces are sweeping along the Adriatic coast towards Vlorë. Këlcyrë is an important coastal town, located in the middle of Sarandë and Vlorë. The Greek plan seems to be to divide their forces into two routes, meeting at the port from the coast and the central route. The port can no longer be used for troop transportation or unloading military supplies due to constant bombing by Greek aircraft. In the Greek conquest of Këlcyrë, three officers and 63 soldiers were killed, and 100 were wounded. The Italian army lost six officers and 80 soldiers killed, 160 wounded, and 300 captured. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Budapest - Greek radio reported that Greek forces occupied two more high mountains yesterday and captured Italian soldiers on all fronts. Although the weather is extremely bad, all Greek forces remain on the offensive. In the highland areas, the snow is three feet deep. Fierce battles are raging on the Këlcyrë and Tepelenë front lines, with Greek forces holding the upper hand. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Rome Admits - War Situation is Serious - Determination to Fight Britain - Still Said to be Unshakeable

Rome - "Italian Daily" said the North African military action is "the largest colonial war in history." The newspaper also mentioned the strength of the British forces in North Africa, stating that the British commander had transferred 300,000 troops and 800 armored cars and tanks from various parts of the empire to North Africa to fight, and that the world's most powerful British Empire believes it can defeat one of the Axis powers with this large army, but the developments in the next few days will prove its estimate wrong. Answering a question raised by a certain American newspaper reporter about Britain being favorable to making a separate peace with Italy, the "Italian Daily" said that Italy firmly adheres to its wartime position, which is unshakeable and will not retreat. (Reuter's dispatch, 17th)

Rome - The Italian people regard the news of the defeats in Albania and North Africa as a transitional period in the war, which is insufficient to affect the final outcome of the war. The Greek offensive has now stalled due to the strong resistance of the Italian army and the snow covering the roads. As for the war in Libya, due to the vastness of the desert and the difficulty of transportation, the British offensive will also come to an end. Gaida of "Italian News" said that the British will soon prove that they have miscalculated. In recent days, a large number of Italians have volunteered to enlist. The meeting of fascist district leaders in Forlì and the good reaction of the Italian stock market all prove that Italians are not pessimistic. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

Rome - Yesterday, officials here denied the exaggerated reports from Britain and Greece. According to the Greek claim, they had captured 200 Italian officers, 7,000 soldiers, 1,500 bicycles, and a British radio report that an Italian destroyer was captured by Greek forces and was bombed by British aircraft when it entered the port of Sarandë. The Italian side stated that only 791 Italian soldiers were missing, and the rest were nonsense. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

### Tangier Issue - Britain Protests to Spain - Opposes Taking Over International Administrative Power

Capital of Sweden - According to an announcement from London yesterday, the British Consul-General in Tangier has protested to the Spanish authorities against the Spanish authorities' takeover of Tangier's international administrative power.

### German Ambassador Arrives in Vichy - Franco-German Relations Delicate - Germany Urges France to Pay Attention to its Position - Flandin Suddenly Falls Ill with Political Sickness

Vichy - After German Ambassador Abetz arrived here yesterday, Marshal Pétain received him at 10:00 this morning and hosted a luncheon in his honor at noon. Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office Baudouin, Naval Minister Admiral Darlan, and Army Minister General Huntziger were also present. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Berlin - Authorities in various aspects yesterday declared that, according to specialized terminology, Germany and France are still at war. The removal of Deputy Prime Minister Laval by France is considered very important and sufficient to raise the following question: "Can the current state of armistice between Germany and France continue to be maintained?" (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Vichy - After arriving here, the new Foreign Minister Flandin contracted the flu. According to a doctor's diagnosis, "Foreign Minister Flandin arrived here at 3:00 PM on the 14th of this month. He caught a cold on the way, resulting in illness. It was diagnosed yesterday morning that he was suffering from the flu with a high fever and needed to rest for several days before he could recover." (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Berlin - German officials have not yet commented on the French government's dismissal of Laval. However, Germany is currently paying attention to the Vichy government's policy on Pan-European cooperation. It is said that no important talks have been held between German and French figures since Hitler and Pétain met in Montoire. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

German Ambassador Makes Three Suggestions to France

German Ambassador Abetz, to the Pétain government in Vichy, arrived here yesterday, carrying three secret suggestions, all based on Flandin replacing Laval as Deputy Prime Minister of France. Abetz has held talks with Marshal Pétain and Flandin respectively. It is expected that Abetz will also consult with Laval today. Observers say that Marshal Pétain's move to tighten control of the government may avoid the danger of Germany occupying all of France, at least for the time being. Marshal Pétain has made it clear that he alone is the master of France and has made it clear that any conspiracy is not allowed. Although the German demands proposed by Abetz have not been disclosed, it is speculated that its purpose is to find a guarantee, guaranteeing that Laval's departure is not a change in Franco-German cooperation. News from Switzerland continues that Laval is in confinement. News from Berlin states that the Germans will not take action until Abetz and Laval have held talks. However, Berlin solemnly declares that France must not forget that it is a defeated country and must not forget Flandin's presence in the cabinet. If anti-German actions are triggered, Germany reserves the right to take free action. (International dispatch, 17th)

Laval's Dismissal - Germany Issues Warning

After the dismissal of French Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, the situation in the areas of France not occupied by Germany is still unclear. Although the German government has issued a warning, stating that if Laval is a sacrifice of an anti-German regime, then Germany's subsequent words have not yet been issued. However, the German government is not commenting on Laval's dismissal at this time. Informed sources predict that Berlin is now waiting to see whether Flandin's appointment as Foreign Minister is a delay or abandonment of Franco-German cooperation. (International dispatch, 17th)

British Report Laval Conspired to Stage Coup

London - French sources here claim that the dismissed French Deputy Prime Minister Laval originally intended to secretly plot to overthrow the Pétain government, and the mastermind behind it was German Ambassador to France Abetz. It is claimed that Laval and Abetz originally wanted to lure Marshal Pétain to Paris, and then instigate a coup. The failure of this conspiracy could have led to Hitler's occupation of all of France, but it is widely believed that the reason why Hitler hesitated was the setbacks suffered by the Italian army in the Mediterranean. The Italian defeat may force Hitler to send troops to assist. Informed French sources say that Abetz persuaded Laval to invite Marshal Pétain to Paris, move the remains of Napoleon's eldest son, the Duke of Reichstadt, to the cemetery of fallen soldiers, and then persuade Pétain to stay in Versailles, preventing him from returning to Vichy. At the same time, Laval would establish a new government in Paris, negotiating peace with the Nazis, and then France would replace Italy as the second largest country in the Axis powers. However, it is learned that when Paris Police Chief Langeron warned French Interior Minister Peyrouton about this matter, Peyrouton turned around and warned Marshal Pétain, so the conspiracy was foiled. (Reuter's dispatch, 17th)

### Syria - The Situation is Unstable

London - According to the Free French News Agency in London, the appointment of General Catroux as commissioner to Syria and Lebanon has caused unrest in those two countries. There have also been frequent incidents of railways and factories being sabotaged in secret. Syria and Lebanon are subject to strict censorship, but the recent appeal of Free French leader General de Gaulle has spread throughout the country. It is noteworthy that this unrest occurred when administrative officials were being transferred in the two mandated territories of Syria and Lebanon. (Reuter's dispatch, 17th)

### Historically the Greatest Event: The Closing of the New York World's Fair (Continued)

In 1940, the second New York World's Fair had the same area (as the first), 19 million visitors, and its expenses and income were (not estimated).

In nearly a hundred years, this New York World's Fair can indeed be regarded as the greatest in the world, surpassing all previous World's Fair records.  In terms of attendance alone, on Sunday, September 3, 1939, there were 492,446 people; and on Sunday, June 2, 1940, there were 379,269. The total number of visitors to the Munich Exposition in 1854 was only about 100,000 more than the number of visitors to this New York fair in a single day.

From the fair's preparation to its opening and closing, the number of staff employed, including those in the various foreign pavilions, totaled no less than 17,000. Their service time ranged from two to four years. The companies participating in the fair have been trying to absorb them into their formal staff.  Among the 4,127 people, 40% had already obtained suitable positions. The General Motors and Ford motor companies were the most diligent in this work, almost completely resolving the future prospects of the employees in this exhibition.

Regarding the exhibitors in the New York World's Fair, specifically the foreign participants, the first session last year had 58 countries, which decreased to 43 countries in the second session this year. The reason for the decrease was entirely due to the impact of the European war.  In addition to these 43 countries, the League of Nations and the Pan American Union, two major international organizations, continued to exhibit this year. Among the products of the various countries, there were many rare and precious items, especially those related to culture, such as various antiques, calligraphy, paintings, ornaments, etc. Due to the war, they could not be transported back to their home countries and were temporarily stored in the United States, to be handled after the situation stabilizes.

The number of staff, laborers, cooks, etc. in the various foreign pavilions was several hundred. After the closing of the fair, these people suddenly lost their place to live. If they were sent back to their countries, firstly, transportation would be difficult due to the lack of ships; secondly, most of them would be homeless, and returning home would only mean the end of their lives.  Therefore, New York Democratic Congressman Mr. D'Laney has submitted a proposal to the House, requesting the government to approve the residence of these foreigners in the United States as permanent residents. Regarding this proposal, not a single foreign member of the fair did not agree.

For several European countries that have already been conquered by Germany, it is practically impossible to transport their products back to their home countries. Therefore, ten weeks before the closing, a large number had been sold out.  Large and valuable exhibits, such as the paintings and sculptures of Italy and France, were mostly priceless, and everyone dared not risk the sea blockade to transport them back to their original locations. Therefore, they can only be sealed in warehouses with strict guards to prevent any accidents, waiting for the end of the war. Many countries, in order to save warehouse rent and promote friendship with the United States, have donated many valuable items to American museums and educational institutions, such as schools and societies. Once approved by the authorities and the U.S. Customs, these items can be moved on a regular basis. When foreign products were imported into the United States, it was stipulated that they were only for exhibition at the fair. Therefore, if they were to be sold, import duties must be paid before they could be sold. Besides selling or donating, there was another way out, which was destruction. Under the supervision of the US authorities, the exhibits could be destroyed, and then the customs duties could be saved.

Since March of last year, the U.S. Customs has sent 28 customs officers to be stationed in the middle of the venue, assessing and collecting taxes on all foreign products at any time. During the closing period, these customs officers were extremely busy. Before the U.S. Customs carried out its duties in the venue, the Legislative Yuan approved several special regulations formulated by the Ministry of Finance. Within six months after the closing, all foreign pavilions must settle their taxes with the customs authorities. Last year, $1 million worth of goods exhibited at the venue have been levied taxes of $275,000.

The famous collection of armor and badges in the British Pavilion has been decided to be donated to the U.S. Library of Congress in Washington.  In addition, a set of genealogy of the founding father of the United States, George Washington, was also donated to the U.S. Library of Congress by the British government. A replica of the British royal crown has been donated to the Anglo-American Ambulance Corps, who will take these replicas of historically famous treasures to various places for exhibition, and use the income as the team's expenses.  The exhibits in the British Maritime Department will probably be donated to the Maritime Museum in Newport News, Virginia.

The literary and historical exhibits in the French Pavilion have also been decided to be donated to American public societies. As for the French national treasures and exhibits related to weapons, worth a total of $2 million, the French Pavilion authorities have not yet announced their future. Perhaps these items will be temporarily sealed in the United States.

Most of the exhibits in the Belgian Pavilion have been sold, and the income will be temporarily kept in the United States, to be claimed by the original owner in the future. Diamond exhibits worth millions of dollars will be returned to their original owners. These valuable items were all collected from Belgian diamond merchants in the United States.

Polish art exhibits and documents of historical value will be moved to the Polish Museum in Chicago. Other products have either been sold or transferred to Polish societies for safekeeping. The paintings will still be returned to their original owners residing in the United States. King Jagiello's tower and statues will remain in place as a permanent memorial in the future "Flushing Meadows Park."

Most of the Italian products will be temporarily sealed in the United States. One hundred waiters in the Italian restaurant, because they had nowhere to live, have moved to a cargo ship outside the port of Philadelphia. (To be continued)

### German Air Force Raids England Adopting New Tactics Last Night Bombs Were Only Dropped in the Northwest Region The Scale of the Air Raid Was Very Small With Only Slight Losses

London The scale of German aircraft air raids in England last night was very small with slight losses. According to the Air Ministry's communique, German aircraft activities over Britain only dropped bombs in the Northwest region. Many houses and shops were destroyed in a certain town in the Midlands. Casualties in the above regions were not numerous. There were also a few deaths and injuries in the London area, and some residences and other buildings were damaged. (Reuters, 17th)

London People here believe that Hitler's aircraft groups must have implemented their new, terrible tactics in London last night. German aircraft flew at extremely high altitudes and stopped the sound of the motors, first ordering a single aircraft to drop a few bombs, then vibrating its motors and making a lot of noise. Before the alarm sounded, they had already flown away. There were two alarms in the London metropolitan area yesterday, lasting for a very short time. No bombs fell in central London, and no anti-aircraft gun sounds were heard. Although the new terror tactics were frightening, the bombing did not follow a fixed procedure and did not involve large-scale attacks. As a result, only a few bombs fell on London. However, the scope of German aircraft air raids in England last night was also very extensive. German aircraft concentrated their attacks on a certain northern and southern town for an hour, but did not launch a large-scale attack. After the first alarm in the London area, a German aircraft flew over and dropped bombs. In the rumble of anti-aircraft guns, the sound of the aircraft flying overhead could still be heard. German aircraft first dropped incendiary bombs and then high-explosive bombs in a certain town in the Midlands, causing fires in many places and damaging many houses, but there were very few deaths and injuries. When German aircraft attacked a northwestern town last night, a movie theater in the workers' area was bombed, and several people were injured, several of whom have died. The London area was quite quiet this morning, and no sounds were heard in the sky after 10 p.m. According to news from Sheffield, five German aircraft dropped incendiary and high-explosive bombs in the city last night, causing fires in many places and damaging many houses, but deaths and injuries were very few.

London The Air Ministry Information Office stated that the night before and early yesterday morning, British heavy bombers attacked Berlin, fiercely bombing railway traffic, munitions factories, and power plants. Frankfurt and Bremen were also attacked. The first batch of British aircraft arrived in Berlin at about 9 p.m. on Sunday. At that time, the clouds were low, and some pilots immediately found their targets, while other pilots looked for other targets, identified several factories and railways, and bombed them. A large fire broke out after a factory was hit. At 3 a.m. on Sunday morning, British aircraft flew in batches again and continuously bombed for more than an hour. At that time, the weather improved and visibility was clear. British aircraft targeted power plants, railway junctions, and warehouses. A batch of high-explosive giant bombs hit the center of a railway junction, causing a fire instantly. When the British aircraft flew away, the fire was intensifying. Several of the heaviest bombs fell on another railway junction. A power plant was hit, and two fires broke out. British aircraft also continuously bombed along the side lines, with rubble flying and black smoke rising. Another team of British bombers attacked the western port of Frankfurt, bombing warehouses, factories, and oil refineries for more than two hours. The free port of Bremen was also fiercely bombed.

### British King George Cares for the People's Well-Being Inspects Bristol

London When the King visited Bristol yesterday, he stood on the rubble and talked to a woman. The woman was holding a baby and told the King that when Bristol was recently heavily bombed, she and her three daughters and baby were at home. A bomb fell, the house was destroyed, and she was buried under the rubble for several hours before being rescued. The King rode in a car for several miles in Bristol to inspect the situation after the bombing, and got out of the car in several places. Men and women rushed forward with thunderous cheers, shouting "We will never be discouraged, may God bless our King." The King then went to the University of Bristol to inspect the damage to the Great Hall. The students cheered. The King went to the western suburbs to visit his mother, Queen Mary, who congratulated the King on his birthday. (Reuters, 17th)

### Basel, Switzerland Suffers Air Raid Causing Extremely Serious Damage The Source of the Bombs is Under Investigation

According to the Navy, this loss is not entirely due to submarine attacks. The dangers of mines, bombers, and enemy raiders should not be ignored. (Reuters, 16th)

### Shenbao Cup Charity Basketball Exhibition Opens The Chinese Team Slightly Loses The American Team Wins by 8 Points at 45 to 37 In the Second Half the Chinese Team Beat the Americans by 5 Points

In the fourth Shenbao Cup Sino-American Charity Basketball Tournament, the Sino-American strong teams met at the West Youth Basketball Hall last night for the first battle for the championship. The Chinese team lost slightly due to poor performance, losing 37 to 45, a difference of only eight points. According to the overall situation, the first half was slightly relaxed, and the Chinese team in the second half suddenly rose to catch up, and the situation suddenly became tense. The atmosphere on the court suddenly heated up, but unfortunately the Chinese team lost too many points in the first half, so although they won by 5 points in the second half with 26 to 21, in the end they still lost by a small margin with 37 to 45. Fortunately, there are still two games tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and it is not too late to make amends. Work harder and victory can be expected. The whole team works together, regardless of each other, and the future is still very bright.

Tense and Exciting The Basketball Hall is Full

Because the competition is bound to be exciting and the competition is tense and stimulating, although the tickets were slightly raised last night, ladies and gentlemen and fans who are enthusiastic about charity still rushed to buy them. Upstairs and downstairs were full and the tickets were sold out. Those who arrived late could not find seats. The organizers deeply apologized. Tomorrow night, they plan to further reduce the number of tickets downstairs to avoid this situation again. Tomorrow's tickets will still be pre-sold at the Shenbao Hall on Hankou Road and Xiqing starting today. Because the number of tickets has decreased, those who want to get them should be even faster.

Poor Luck Before the Game, One Point is Lost

The reason for the Chinese team's small defeat last night, according to analysis, is not that individual skills are not as good as the team's cooperation, which has not yet reached a good level. In the first half, the ball hovered around the hoop, throwing it again and again, and failing to shoot. The luck of the ball was really bad. Moreover, the new ball had not been mastered. The individual performances of the whole team were still good. Zhang Shaoqing's performance was the most satisfactory, and he was penalized for a technical foul (new rule) for being late after the referee urged him three times before entering the court. Henke Sharvitz scored the first point, and the Chinese army lost one point before the war, which was an ominous sign.

Rapid Advances Sticking State

The lineup on the court was Chen Xuechong as the center for the Chinese team, Feng Nianhua and Chen Xianglong on both wings, and Lu Zhongen and Li Zhenzhong guarding the rear. The American team was composed of Rookie, Henke Sharvitz, and Huatai as the forwards, and Carson and Simpson as the guards. After the two teams finished their lineups and circled for a while, Huatai raised his right hand and skillfully penetrated the basket, and the American team scored three points. The Chinese army counterattacked, and Feng Nianhua did not enter the basket twice. The bad luck of the ball was unparalleled. Before long, Rookie and Simpson committed fouls one after another, and Lu Zhongen and Chen Xianglong scored both penalty shots, making it two to three. Carson, Nianhua, and Huatai then scored penalty shots one after another, making it three to five. At that time, the defense on both sides was extremely strict, and the battle situation fell into a stalemate. There was no record for three minutes, and in addition to the rapid rise and fall, the excitement was very strong. Seeing that Feng Nianhua was under the strict surveillance of Carson and it was difficult to develop, the Chinese army transferred Zhang Shaoqing. Henke Sharvitz took the opportunity to enter and scored one shot and one penalty, and the American army increased by three points again, making the score eight to three.

A Bloody Path Opened Fierce

The Chinese team was not lucky. Xuechong and Xianglong repeatedly missed the shot. Before long, Zhang Shaoqing opened a bloody path from the encirclement. Chen Xianglong received assistance, drilled under the basket, and turned over, winning thunderous applause. It was close to ten minutes at the time. The battle situation became more and more intense at this point, but unfortunately the Chinese team still did not improve. There were many omissions in receiving the ball, so Huatai made a long shot, and Simpson tucked it under the basket, and the American team increased by four points, forming a score of twelve to seven. The Chinese army called a timeout and replaced Zhang Lu with Bao Songyuan, and the battle situation replayed the stalemate. Li Zhenzhong was extremely active, but unfortunately the enemy's flames were spreading, and Hansa Sharvitz and Rookie also hit the basket one after another. The Chinese army fought bravely and counterattacked. As expected, the child's face made one penalty and one shot, scoring three points in a row. Bao Songyuan tucked it under the basket, from six to sixteen, chasing to eleven to sixteen. Unexpectedly, the American team actually hit four baskets in a row within two minutes. The Chinese team then lagged behind in the first half with eleven to twenty-four.

Wonderful is Presented One Strike Fails

The war drums were sounded again, and the American army transferred a pure Maling White team. The Chinese army also transferred Wang Nanzhen, and the big cat Sun Huiping, and Xuechong Shaoqing Zhenzhong, forming a sharp and unmatched fire net. Not long after the exchange, Nanzhen scored a wonderful shot, and the applause was thunderous, but the momentum of the American army did not diminish, making the score fourteen and thirty-three. Huajun Nanzhen Shaoqing each got two penalties, and the big cat also hit the basket, and the situation gradually improved, and the score chased to twenty to thirty-four. The American army was seriously threatened, so they transferred the giant Yenik and Mattley, who weighed more than 240 pounds. At this time, the Chinese team took the opportunity to rise, and everything went smoothly. After twenty to thirty-eight, Wang Nanzhen shot a long shot, hitting the bullseye skillfully, Zhang Shaoqing waved in, Sun Da Mao scored two penalties, Shaoqing also followed suit, and Xuechong Shaoqing's combined shots were like shooting beads, and no bullets fell empty. The momentum was so strong that there was an overwhelming atmosphere, chasing to 31 to 39, only four goals behind. There were six minutes left, and the American team hurriedly transferred Carson, Hansa Sharvitz, Simpson, Rookie and other old men to regain the decline. While the Chinese team was in great vigor, Xuechong Da Mao scored three penalties and the score was closer (34 to 39). Da Mao Shaoqing scored one penalty each, and chased to 37 to 41 in an instant. The situation at this point reached its climax of tension, excitement and stimulation. The Chinese team had a voice that came from behind, unexpectedly in the last fifty seconds, the American team had a great fortune, and increased by four points, Henke Sharvitz was penalized for four fouls and was sent off. Before long, the end-of-the-game bell had sounded, and the Chinese team failed to complete the last one and lost slightly with 37 to 45.

### Grains: Price Limits on Imported Rice are Merely a Facade; Actual Sales are of Inferior Goods at Premium Prices; Broken Rice is Also Expensive, Approaching Eighty Yuan; Japonica Rice Actually Sells for One Hundred Yuan per Shi

Imported rice has temporarily become quiet under strict conditions. Because of the price limits, merchants cannot raise prices as they wish, so they are reluctant to sell. They claim that medium-quality goods have already reached the price limit, and high-quality goods cannot be openly increased by one or two yuan. Therefore, only medium-quality rice is traded in the market, and high-quality rice has disappeared. For example, Saigon No. 1 is 87 yuan, No. 2 is 81.5 yuan, "Huojiao" is 80.8 yuan, "Xiaojiao" is 79 yuan, and Siam No. 2 is 80 yuan, all lower-quality rice being sold at one or two yuan less than usual. For some goods, the market price is still rising by one or two yuan. Rice tea (half-grain broken rice) has also risen to 79.2 yuan, and medium-quality broken rice is all at 75 or 76 yuan, which is two yuan higher than the previous market price. Cargoes from the British-American Tobacco Company on the English-China Steamship Line are not favored by steady domestic customers, because of transportation delays and all sorts of risks, and because of the need to pay fixed prices in foreign currency. Therefore, they are not as popular as existing rice stocks. However, because supply is less than demand, market prices continue to rise. Saigon No. 2 for December is quoted at 93.5, 94, and 94.5 yuan. "Xiaojiao" for December 9 is 92.45 yuan. February is 83.8 or 84 yuan for five hundred tons. The price is also one yuan higher than the previous market price. Only 4,000 bags of imported rice have been traded.

Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Jinan steamer transported 1,430 bags from Hong Kong and arrived yesterday morning, berthing at the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession to unload the cargo. (Zu)

Domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica, is difficult to obtain, and market inventories are also scarce. Scarcity makes the product dear, so that the selling price continues to increase by one or two yuan due to insufficient supply. Kunshan "hu" of white japonica is seen at 100 yuan, 99 yuan, and especially 102 yuan. Qingjiao "hu" of thin rice is seen at 90.05 yuan and 89 yuan, and Yili glutinous rice, a domestic product, sells for 95 yuan. Hong Kong white rice sells for 84 or 85 yuan, and glutinous mung beans sell for 75 or 73 yuan.

### Flour Market's Rising Trend Intensifies

Australian imported flour breaks a high price of 22 yuan

Wheat Flour - The market's rising trend intensified yesterday. The rising rice prices in recent days have created a sense of crisis. Delays in the arrival of Australian flour have also had an impact, attracting the attention of both wholesalers and speculators. Most cargo owners are taking advantage of this opportunity to hoard and raise prices even further. It is reported that the price of "Wild Boar", "Flower God", "High-Card" and Australian flour has reached a new high of 22 yuan, which was completely unexpected. The most abundant "Flower Bird" and "Bell Tower" brands have also risen to 21.5 yuan, and the price is quite high. However, a new ship of "Flag" imported flour, estimated at more than 70,000 bags, including "Fort", "Golden Card" and other brands, has arrived. It is reported that there is already supply in the market, and the selling price is similar to that of the "Flower Bird" and "Bell Tower" brands. As for affordable factory flour, the price remains at the original level of 18 yuan. The factory has already indicated that it will increase prices, but the matter is still under discussion.

Wheat - The market situation became even tighter yesterday. Supplies remained scarce. Both Japanese and Chinese factories were eager to purchase, but there was no suitable quantity to acquire. Although the factories intended to offer higher prices, they were unable to reach an agreement with sellers. Therefore, transactions were still conducted with reluctance. It was reported that a hundred or so packages of Kuntai wheat were opened at a price of 31 yuan and it was still rising at noon.

### Oilseed Cake - Edible Oil is Hoarded Again

Yesterday's oil market was not completely settled due to futures disputes (the settlement price for February was undecided). Although the major short-sellers set a settlement price of 111 yuan for Qingdao raw oil delivered in late December, the speculators and opportunists were still in dispute, and it was rumored that a settlement price of 112 yuan might quell the disturbances. Therefore, the market atmosphere was still dull in the morning. In the afternoon, speculators began to trade again, creating a lively atmosphere. The reason was that futures trading had virtually stopped, and they were all turning to spot goods. Therefore, buying and selling became active again for a time, and market prices rose by more than two yuan in the upward trend.

Yesterday, 1,000 cans of Qingdao raw oil, 625 bags of soybeans, 100 bags of raw peanuts, 250 cans of raw oil, and 55 bags of sesame seeds, and 858 cans of sesame oil were transported to Xiamen. In addition, 685 bags of soybeans, 200 bags of raw peanuts, 115 bags of sesame seeds, and 3,240 pieces of soybean cake were transported to Hong Kong. Today, 1,140 bags of soybeans, 1,240 pieces of soybean cake, and 100 bags of sesame seeds will be transported to Singapore, and 1,000 pieces of soybean cake and 250 pieces of raw peanuts will be transported to Hong Kong.

### Finance - Although the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's Quoted Rates Retracted, the Black Market for Foreign Exchange Loosened

The British pound rate was revised to 3 shillings and 6.625 pence, and the US dollar rate to 5.6875 yuan, both tightened by 0.0625.

Although a few speculators came to buy, they sought to sell to the market in the afternoon, leading to loosening. As a result, the British pound was at 3 shillings and 6.6875 pence, and the US dollar was at 5.84375 yuan, 0.015625 and 0.03125 higher than the previous day's closing price, respectively.

Afternoon Fluctuations Were Small

The market was looser in the afternoon. The Japanese bank came to sell again, with this month's US dollar being absorbed by the British bank at 5.84375 yuan. It was subsequently heard that speculators wanted to fill at 5.84375 yuan, but there were few transactions. The changes were minimal until the late closing. As a result, the near-term spot British pound was at 3 shillings and 6.6875 pence, and the US dollar was at 5.84375 yuan.

The New York telegraphic transfer rose by 0.0625 to 6.5 yuan. The Shanghai rate was unchanged, remaining at 90 yuan and 0.025 yuan (telegraph code awaiting verification). The "Lianchao" black market rose by 6 jiao to 85.4 yuan.

### Profit-Taking Emerges, Gold Market Retreats Sharply

Yesterday's gold market in the spot and black markets saw an initial rise followed by a reversal and decline, once approaching the 6,000 yuan mark. Later, the price retreated to below 5,900 yuan. This was because rumors of a German envoy flying to Chongqing resurfaced. Therefore, although a certain bank vigorously purchased more than 2,000 taels, securities firms dumped more than 3,000 taels. The foreign exchange rate also reported firmness, causing the confidence of various parties to weaken. After opening at 5,940 yuan, the price soared to a high of 5,980 yuan as banks covered short positions and the US dollar softened. However, this was short-lived, and the price fell back down after a large amount of selling by brokerage firms. The foreign exchange rate was stable and firm, and there were reports of a certain bull company in western Shanghai exiting the market. The price then declined, and it fell to a low of 5,885 yuan in the afternoon. Eventually, gold companies and retail short-sellers covered their positions, causing the price to rise again, closing at 5,922 yuan, 23 yuan lower. The total daily transaction volume was 6,000 to 7,000 taels. Swap buyers posted 200 taels to gold companies, etc., at a price of 36 or 37 yuan. Cash transactions were still rare, with the price being 38 yuan lower than the futures price. Gold ornaments rose by 5 yuan to 605 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.

Spot Decreased by 23 Yuan

In the early morning, due to the strong rising trend outside the market on the previous day, the opening price was firm. Qian Duijie released 20 taels to the bank at 5,940 yuan. Before long, banks vigorously purchased, and other retail investors also bought. With limited supply, the price rose to 5,980 yuan, only 20 yuan away from the 6,000 yuan mark. However, the high price triggered profit-taking by bulls, and a major securities firm sold a large amount, causing the price to decline. The bank counter-traded 20 taels, with only 5,903 yuan. Although there were several ups and downs, the buyers were hesitant due to the flat foreign exchange rate and unfounded bearish news. After 11:00, a securities firm sold 20 taels to the bank, also at only 5,925 yuan. At noon, thanks to the support of banks and Qian Duijie, the market closed at 5,915 yuan. In the early afternoon, there were very few fluctuations. The bank counter-traded 20 taels, with 5,910 yuan as the opening price. The bank advanced to the gold company with 20 taels, a slight increase of 5 yuan, to 5,915 yuan. Later, the selling pressure was stimulated by a slightly firmer foreign exchange rate, pushing the price below 900 yuan. The gold company filled 20 taels to the bank, falling to a low of 5,885 yuan. Later, it was heard that a major securities firm returned to aggressively search, pulling the price back out of the 900 yuan mark. The bank counter-traded 20 taels at 5,925 yuan. In the evening, the bank again counter-traded 20 taels at 5,922 yuan, as the closing price of the day, which was 23 yuan lower than the previous day. The full-day fluctuation was 95 yuan. The selling price of cash company's own brand gold was more than 10 yuan lower than the spot futures price, and the purchase price was 50 yuan lower. The current standard gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the posted gold, and there were few transactions.

Gold Ornaments at 605 Yuan

The morning price for gold ornaments at silver shops was up 5 yuan, and remained unchanged afterwards. As a result, Datongxing listed 605 yuan, and Xintongxing's price was similar to the previous price, with the purchase price about 30 yuan lower.

### Foreign Currencies Fall

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the spot price suddenly turn downward. The British and American pounds also fell by one yuan each. The British pound notes remained fixed, and the market price was flat. The American dollar notes followed the downward trend, falling to 17.05 yuan in the evening, a decline of 0.15 yuan from the previous day. This was because there were strong rumors in the market about peace between China and Japan. Japanese gold notes were still in demand, with the evening price reaching a high of 1.585 yuan. Korean notes were also in high demand, with the evening price reaching a high of 1.33 yuan.

### Securities - Public Bonds Once Excited - But Disappeared in an Instant -

Public bonds: In the afternoon yesterday, rumors suddenly spread that the German envoy was going to Chongqing, and the atmosphere of peace rekindled. The market price rose, but this was unlikely to have any effect, because the rumors were unreliable. However, the prices of Yugan paper and cotton yarn have turned downward, and people's hearts are slightly disturbed. Yesterday morning was still sluggish and weak, hovering between 0.15 yuan, and the transactions were very few. In the afternoon, rumors of a peaceful atmosphere circulated. Only Xinfu Company was interested and United Hongda Company tried its best to buy, with as many as five or six hundred thousand. The other companies were not very enthusiastic about buying. No. 38 bought about 100,000, and Xiekang and Renchang each bought 350,000. The sellers were mainly Jiufeng, and others such as Yongkang, Yizhong, Houda, and No. 4 were in short supply. The market price rose by 0.2 to 0.5 yuan. The turnover was 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 300 shares of Wing On Company were traded at a price of 19.25 yuan.

Public utility stock market: not as active as the previous day, and the price has also fallen slightly. The underlying trend is still good. The trading of various well-known stocks is not uncommon, but the ups and downs are very narrow. This may be due to the lack of news and the upcoming holidays. Rubber stocks are stable.

London 16th (Monday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debts and Far Eastern British commercial company stocks were flat and stagnant. The market had no ups or downs.

### Yarn and Cotton - After Five Consecutive Days of Increases, the Yarn Market Began to Retract Yesterday - Double Horse Fell Back by 20 Yuan

The yarn market, which had soared on the previous day, retreated and fell back yesterday. This was because the five consecutive days of gains had raised the price by 70 yuan, triggering profit-taking. As a result, the market became loose, and the market turned from rising to weak. However, the amount absorbed by major players remained calm. However, most floating longs, seeing that the environment was slightly weak, closed their positions. At the same time, small silver shops specialized in speculation, advancing when the market was firm and retreating when it was soft, so market prices often exceeded the norm. However, the market price of 32-count single yarn continued to rise. 32-count Double Horse has been sold for 1,640 yuan. Yesterday, 86 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong, and another 1,518 pieces will be transported to Hong Kong today.

Due to the strong momentum in the afternoon of the previous day, the morning opening of Double Horse was still enthusiastic among buyers. The opening price was 1,343 yuan. At this time, the shouts of those wanting to buy were very troublesome. Before long, the price rose to 1,345 yuan, then rose and fell, hovering in the three or four yuan range for about two hours. Around 11:00, the selling pressure became very strong. The general speculators, seeing that the market price was not rising, and the foreign exchange rate was tight and then loose, mostly sold and closed their positions on calls from small silver shops. The market price gradually fell to 1,320 yuan. However, a part of the profitable short positions came to cover, and the price rose back to 1,326 yuan. However, the short positions came to trade again, and the closing price was 1,320 yuan. According to the transaction statistics for half a day, 6,830 bales were traded. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 20 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed on the left.

Fellow Merchants: 6,000; Hong Kong: 630

Mainland: 200; Total: 6,830

The yarn market continued to be flat in the afternoon. 20-count Double Horse was first made at 1,320 yuan, followed by shouts of 1,318 yuan, but no one was willing to sell. As a result, someone wanted to buy at 1,320 yuan, but there were very few sellers.

### Cotton Market Stagnant

The current cotton situation is calm. Factories have not shown large-scale activity, but the trend is becoming more tranquil. The implementation of various sources of supply is still difficult. Therefore, industry insiders are thinking well, but they are buying more Indian cotton and American cotton.

Another message: The market price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market is weak, first under pressure from sellers, and then due to the weakness of Wall Street stocks and some southern hedging sales, resulting in domestic prices falling by two or three pounds. India, together with the forecast yesterday rose by one rupee.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quite sluggish recently. Factory demand is weak, which has a huge impact on the cotton market. Raw cotton transportation is dangerous, and industry insiders are thinking highly, but they have not been able to stimulate cotton prices. However, general observations show that the current cotton market is stagnant, which is a temporary phenomenon and may improve in the near future.

### Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Profit Taking and Reselling

Factory cloth is slightly weak, because the recent rise has been very sharp, and actual sales are still mediocre. Floating longs are taking profits and reselling, and the market price is hovering. White goods and coarse cloth are flat, and fine cloth and twill are down by 0.25 yuan. Part of the bleached and dyed cloth has also loosened by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. The transaction on the street has suddenly become light, and more than 500 pieces of various cloths have been traded. The Cantonese and Hong Kong offices bought more than 200 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, bleached cloth, and poplin. The Yantai office in the northern region bought more than 100 pieces of heavyweight coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. The Zhejiang and Fujian offices have reduced the amount of new purchases due to poor transportation. Foreign countries such as Singapore have ordered 2,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth.

Eastern cloth has been lowered as yarn prices have fallen and retail investors have sold. Therefore, the leading fine cloth and Four Gentlemen serge in the market have also fallen. However, actual sales are still good. Industry insiders will buy when prices are low in the future, and the situation is stable. Fine cloth has fallen by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan per piece, fine twill has fallen by 0.25 yuan, and serge has fallen by 0.015 yuan. The minimum price of leading fine cloth has reached 37.1 yuan, and the closing price is 37.2 yuan. Serge is 1.112 yuan.

17 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen on the 17th, and 695 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. On the 18th, another 1,575 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 25 pieces were shipped to Singapore.

### Domestic Mill Woolens Rise Again

Domestic mill woolens were very tight in the market yesterday, and standards have risen. With the exception of overcoat wool, thin goods needed for spring, summer, and autumn sales have uniformly risen. The factory prices of various mills have risen again from today, averaging one yuan to one and a half yuan per yard, causing market sentiment to be quite high. Retail and wholesale prices have also risen. The reasons for this decision to raise prices are half due to the arrival of raw materials and the relationship between cost and mill price, and half due to the strong hoarding by insiders and outsiders.

### Sugar Market - Dutch Raw Sugar is the Tightest

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten. The association's listed prices were: 24 coarse white, 76 yuan for foreign warehouse goods, up 0.5 yuan. Dutch raw sugar continued to rise due to the transfer of production prices, with spot goods at 60 yuan, up 0.7 yuan. Order forms for the end of this month were 60.02 to 0.1 yuan, up 0.5 or 0.6 yuan. The order forms for the end of this month for Taikoo Granulated B mark road goods were still 75 yuan. DY mark, West Warehouse, 71.6 yuan, up 0.2 yuan. XH mark 71.34 yuan, up 0.34 yuan. There were no other transactions. On the 27th, 15,800 bags of sugar will arrive from Hong Kong.

### Dried and Assorted Goods - Longkou Noodles Rise by 10 Yuan

Threaded noodles are in season in winter, and the stock is light. Therefore, the market has rebounded. Longkou noodles are 160 yuan, up 10 yuan. Qingdao noodles are 140 yuan, up 5 yuan. Jiangbei noodles rose to 110 yuan. However, soup noodles are cheaper, with medium-to-high quality goods selling for 60 yuan per pass.

### Coal: Cooked Coal Taking Advantage of the Situation to Hoard

The cooked coal market has recently become active in this area due to the disruption of the supply of Taiwan grass bag coke. Inventory is depleted, and the spot price is being shouted as high as 230-240 yuan. As a result, cooked coal merchants are also taking advantage of the situation to hoard and restrict sales. Among fellow merchants, lump coal is priced at 200 yuan per ton, and mixed coal is 190 yuan per ton. Delivery to stores incurs additional transportation costs. It is said that stores in this area are already selling at 12 yuan per load.

### Wang Jia Lane Houses to Be Demolished, Residents Will Be Displaced, Those Still Residing Are Barely One or Two Out of Ten, Rickshaw Donation Difficult to Proceed Smoothly

Yesterday, the situation in the Shanghai West District remained the same. The Great Western Road and Yidingpan Road were still blocked. The precautions at other places such as Jing'an Temple Road and Yu Garden Road were the same as yesterday. However, pedestrians entering and leaving the area who were carrying clothing were subject to strict searches before being allowed to pass.

Wang Village Residents Forced to Relocate

At Wang Jia Lane, the site on Great Western Road where Japanese Sergeant Sasaki was assassinated, the Japanese not only stationed two armed Japanese soldiers and four contract police officers, but also stipulated that the entry and exit times were from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Residents were allowed to carry items out of the lane, but were prohibited from carrying any items into it. Yesterday, the Japanese issued an order to demolish the houses in Wang Jia Lane and ordered all residents in Zaizhai Village to be evacuated, so less than two out of ten remained.

Zhu Jia Bang Still Under Strict Guard

The barbed wire outside the wooden gate of Zhu Jia Bang on Yidingpan Road has been completely removed. The opening hours remain from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. However, most of the residents have already moved out. The Japanese soldiers guarding the area still number two, supplemented by five contract police officers. According to residents in the lane, this measure by the Japanese may continue for a long time, as the Japanese have not yet recognized the area as a safe zone as of yesterday.

Public Buses Operate in Sections

Yesterday, the British-owned public buses on various routes were still unable to directly enter the semi-blocked area of the Japanese. Public buses on Routes 1, 2, and 9 still used Jing'an Temple as a connecting station. Public buses on Routes 1 and 2 operating in the semi-blocked area had "Stop at Jing'an Temple" signs posted on the front. Due to the continued blockage of Great Western Road and Yidingpan Road, the Route 14 double-decker buses still terminated at Great Western Road and Difeng Road. The fare was one jiao regardless of distance.

Rickshaws All Withdraw from Shanghai West

The English-language Great American Evening Post stated that the "Municipal Government's" plan to levy rickshaw donations in the Shanghai West District may not achieve its purpose. This is because the rickshaw owners in this port are unwilling to register their vehicles with the "Municipal Government." The "authorities" in the area have decided to levy a "permit fee" of 12 yuan per rickshaw. However, because the rickshaw owners have already paid a permit fee to the authorities of the British and French concessions, they are unwilling to pay an additional "permit fee" of 12 yuan. They are now considering withdrawing rickshaws from the Shanghai West District.

### Yunnan Uprising: All Circles Silently Commemorate

The 25th of this month is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. All circles in Shanghai believe that the Yunnan Uprising re-established the foundation of the nation and is of great significance. At that time, all will silently commemorate to encourage themselves. In accordance with central government regulations, the December 5th Zhaowu Uprising anniversary will also be held on the same day.

### Rice Market Management Committee Forms Supervisory Group

The Rice Industry Tea Party Market Management Committee held a market management committee meeting at the Qinglian Pavilion Gongyang Room yesterday afternoon. All management committee members attended and deliberated. They unanimously agreed with various proposals of the Bean and Rice Industry Association to stabilize the rice market and resolved: (1) All market management committee members will form a supervisory group and take turns to supervise the business operations of fellow merchants daily. If any transactions exceeding the price limit are found, they will be handed over to the authorities for severe punishment; (2) Those without permits are strictly prohibited from entering the market to do business. The meeting adjourned at that time.

Strictly Prohibit Grey Market Trading

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association issued a joint emergency announcement in the market yesterday morning to thoroughly eliminate illegal transactions and grey market trading in the market: "It is found that the prices of various foreign rice have been evaluated and determined, and the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee and the Market Management Committee have announced it to all. The rice price in the market increased again before yesterday. In order to prevent exceeding the evaluation, we should try to suppress it. The two associations held an emergency joint meeting on the 16th of this month to discuss it.

Responsibility for Reporting

It is generally believed that most of the transactions in the rice market are handled by brokers. The Market Management Committee is hereby ordered to conduct a thorough investigation. If grey market premium trading occurs again, and the Rice and Grain Friendship Society fails to report it truthfully, all brokers of the society should be prohibited from entering the market. If fellow merchants of the two associations participate in such transactions, in addition to petitioning the authorities for severe punishment, they should also be prohibited from entering the market and their membership should be revoked. The above measures must be strictly implemented to maintain the evaluation and eliminate the grey market in order to stabilize the rice market." It is recorded in the minutes. Please follow it together.

### Fufeng Flour Mill Labor Strike Still Difficult to Resolve; Police Ordered Workers Out of Factory, Clash Occurred, Fortunately No Serious Incident

The labor strike at the Fufeng Flour Mill on Moganshan Road, which began the day before yesterday at 8 AM when workers demanded improved treatment from the management and engaged in a slowdown, has not been resolved despite several attempts at mediation by Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, the factory reported to the Putuo Road police station that the entire workforce of eight or nine hundred people was still inside the factory, fearing an accident. The police chief personally led sixty or seventy Chinese and foreign detectives in police vans to suppress the situation, ordering all workers to leave the factory. Unexpectedly, twenty or thirty people climbed onto the factory roof and threw bricks and tiles. Fortunately, no one was injured. Fearing the situation would escalate, the police immediately called the fire department, dispatching several vehicles to the scene to spray water at the workers. While connecting the water hoses, many of them jumped over the roof and escaped to the neighboring Xinhua Yarn Factory. The police officers surrounded the area, resulting in the arrest of several individuals who were taken to the police station. The labor strike at the factory has become increasingly serious, and it will likely be difficult to resolve in the short term.

Dazhonghua Rubber Factory Resumes Work

More than 1,500 workers at the Dazhonghua First Rubber Company, located at 1102 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, had a dispute with the management over the attached annex to the labor-management contract they signed. The labor side suddenly went on strike at 2:30 PM on the 3rd of this month. A Pingming News Agency reporter learned yesterday that the strike had been resolved the day before yesterday (the 16th) at around 2:00 PM after further negotiations between representatives of both labor and management. The management agreed to implement three items from the attached annex to the labor-management contract, effective January 1st: (1) Sunday holidays, (2) female temporary workers who have worked for six months will be converted to permanent workers, and (3) male temporary workers who have worked for six months will be converted to monthly salaries. Wages for the strike period will be paid by the factory at half the standard rate from the day before the strike (the 2nd). The labor side considered this satisfactory and did not raise the proposed seventeen new demands. All workers resumed work yesterday at 2:00 PM. At the same time, more than 500 workers at the Jiaotong Rubber Factory on Bailinan Road also resumed work. The two-week strike was resolved.

Yongning Company Workers' Demands

More than 500 workers at the Yongning Printing Company, an American-owned company in Shanghai, demanded improved treatment from the company. The day before yesterday, they held a meeting and decided on the following four conditions: 1. Increase the basic allowance from 元 to 50 yuan. 2. For those whose ordinary allowance salary is less than 50 yuan, it will be calculated at 10%, using 5 yuan as the base (the company's ordinary allowance is issued based on the rice price as a percentage of salary, for example, if the rice price is above 80, an additional 80% of salary will be issued). 3. Workers who take less than two days of leave in a month will have the original pre-war reward of two days of increased work reinstated. 4. Double salary at the end of the year. After the workers presented the above conditions to the person in charge of the Shanghai factory of the company, it was reported that the management had agreed to consider them and stated that they would send the conditions to the Hong Kong head office for instructions. They expected a satisfactory response upon receiving a reply.

French Newspaper Hires New Workers

The entire workforce of the French-language Shanghai Daily demanded improved treatment. The two sides reached a stalemate. On the 16th, the newspaper dismissed all the workers and hired new ones. Therefore, the newspaper was published yesterday, but the format was changed to one sheet.

### American-Owned Radio Station Broadcasting Again Disrupted; Investigation Reveals Originating from Japanese Warship in Huangpu River; U.S. Consul to Lodge Complaint Upon Receipt of Report

The Hua Mei Radio Station, an American-owned station with the call sign XMHA and a frequency of 600, experienced disruption to its broadcasts from external radio waves starting at 4 PM on the 16th, causing intermittent outages, according to station manager Mr. Hailai, speaking to reporters. It has now been determined that the disrupting radio waves originated from a certain Japanese warship in the Huangpu River. Mr. Hailai has notified the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai of this matter. It is noted that the American-owned radio station also experienced disruptions in the spring of this year, so this is now the second occurrence.

Disruption Due to Refusal to Submit to Inspection

The radio waves emitted by the Japanese warship are aimed at disrupting the news broadcasts of American news announcer Al Cow, who broadcasts three times a day on the Hua Mei Radio Station. It is widely believed that the reason the Japanese side is imposing this "radio blockade" on the Hua Mei Radio Station is that the station manager has refused the request from the Japanese Radio Administration Office to reduce its power to 200 watts and to submit its broadcast news for inspection. According to Hailai, he received a letter from the director of the Radio Administration Office from its Nanjing Road office outlining the above request.

Al Cow Explains the Situation

According to Al Cow, he hinted three weeks ago that the station's radio waves would be disrupted. However, for the past three weeks, the radio waves being interfered with were those of the French Radio Station (call sign FFZ). It was only the day before yesterday that the Hua Mei Radio Station was affected. At 10:15 PM the night before, when Al Cow began broadcasting, the disrupting radio waves temporarily stopped for a few minutes, allowing for clear reception. At that time, Mr. Cow explained to the audience who was emitting the radio waves and the reasons behind it, and stated that his broadcast could be heard clearly at frequencies of 630 and 640. As soon as he finished speaking, the radio waves were disrupted again, making the broadcast completely unintelligible. However, reception was quite clear at a frequency of 640.

U.S. Consul Expresses Intention to Take Action

Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Al Cow's broadcast was not disrupted, but when he broadcast at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the radio waves were disrupted again. According to Hailai, Hua Mei Radio Station is prepared to deal with this resolutely and will broadcast simultaneously at frequencies of 600 and 640, and at 25 meters, continuing to fight the Administration Office. Regardless of whether it is disrupted or not, it will not comply with its demands. U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Lockwood, told reporters yesterday morning that he had received notification of the disruption to the American-owned radio station's broadcasts and is waiting for the station to formally file an objection before taking action.

### No Decision Yet on Forming a Rickshaw Company

The authorities of the International Settlement are still studying the plan proposed by several rickshaw owners in the settlement to form a joint rickshaw company. A spokesman for the Municipal Council stated that a decision on this matter cannot be made in the near future. According to the rickshaw owners, the implementation of this plan would reduce the number of rickshaws in the settlement by 20%. They pointed out that if the Municipal Council approves the plan for a joint company, the rickshaws will provide a better service to the public.

### Winter Solstice Approaching; Improve Gift-Giving Customs; Use National Construction Savings Bonds or Bank Certificates of Deposit

The headquarters of the Lide Fellowship issued a notice to its members yesterday, advocating for the use of National Construction Savings Bonds for gift-giving to conserve resources. It stated that the Winter Solstice, Christmas, New Year, and other Chinese and Western festivals are approaching, and the exchange of gifts between relatives and friends to strengthen friendships has become a long-standing custom that is not easy to eliminate. However, as we live in an isolated island, we must ask ourselves if our national salvation work has accomplished much. If we continue to waste resources arbitrarily and deplete the nation's vitality, how can we face the loyal and brave soldiers? Moreover, the continued increase in the cost of living is expected. If we do not make an effort to be frugal, how can we overcome this difficulty? We sincerely hope that all members will correct the current customs. If there is a need to give gifts, use National Construction Savings Bonds (which can be purchased from post offices or banks in Hong Kong) or, for convenience, use fixed-term certificates of deposit from national banks to avoid unnecessary waste. Accumulate small amounts to preserve the vitality of the nation and its people. Furthermore, we hope that members will strictly adhere to their posts, be loyal and self-disciplined, and await the arrival of a bright future.

### U.S. Ship Detained by Japan; Case Transferred to Tokyo for Negotiation; U.S. Second Protest Remains Unanswered; Requesting Direct Handling by U.S. Ambassador to Japan

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post, the case of the American ship "Dasheng," detained by the Japanese naval authorities off the coast of Zhejiang for six weeks, has now been transferred to Tokyo for handling. It is expected that the U.S. Embassy in Japan will directly negotiate with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The U.S. consular authorities here have made two protests regarding the detention of the ship.

Two Protests Lodged

The reply to the first protest was considered vague and unsatisfactory. Despite repeated inquiries from the U.S. side, there has been no response to the second protest. The "Dasheng" was detained near Dinghai in early November and remains there without being released. Passengers on board were allowed to come to Shanghai after being detained for ten days, but it is reported that the ship's crew remains on board.

Shortly after learning of the ship's detention, the U.S. authorities here lodged a protest with the Japanese consulate, pointing out that Japan has no legal right to blockade the Chinese coast and that Japanese warships cannot legally stop and question American ships. Reportedly, the Japanese response to this protest avoided the main issue. Therefore, the U.S. consulate lodged a second, stronger protest, but the Japanese side has not yet responded. After waiting more than two weeks without a response, the U.S. consulate here has transferred the matter to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and requested that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew demand a response from Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka.

### Year-End Approaching; Financial Settlements; Savings and Commercial Departments Pay Interest; Ample Funds Ensure Smooth Transition

December 31, 1940, is approaching soon. The banking and financial industries are handling annual financial settlements. The interest payments for ordinary banks are on the 20th for the savings department and on the 25th for the commercial department. The overall financial settlement is scheduled for December 31st, with holidays on January 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. Unless otherwise stipulated by contract, all debts owed by various accounts must be cleared before the end of the lunar year. However, although the money industry is handling financial settlements, it is only a general settlement. The overall settlement for the money industry is usually at the end of the lunar year, and the overall settlements of various industries are based on the money industry's handling. Therefore, the end of the Western year has no major impact on the financial market. Moreover, given the current abundance of floating capital and relaxed monetary policy, the Shanghai financial market is unlikely to experience tension. The smooth transition of various industries through the end of the Western year is guaranteed. Various industries have also begun preparations for all matters related to the end of the lunar year.

### Russian Bodyguards in Shanghai Preparing to Form Union

According to the Continental Daily, there are a large number of Russian doormen, private bodyguards, and escort guards in Shanghai. Some protect important people, while others are employed by foreign shipping companies to stay on ships and prevent theft. Therefore, their role is very important. They are now tending toward a unified organization. Once the organization is completed, it will undoubtedly be a powerful labor group in Shanghai. The process is actively underway. A meeting was held recently at the Russian General Association. Mr. Ivanov, Chairman of the White Russian Emigrant Committee in Shanghai, strongly supports the effort and immediately established a preparatory committee to be responsible for all organizational matters.

### U.S. Garrison Hosts Banquet for Blind Children

The U.S. Fourth Fleet stationed in Shanghai is scheduled to host a banquet for more than 90 blind students at the Blind Children's School at 290 Hongqiao Road this Sunday, December 22nd. Representatives from both the garrison and the school authorities will attend. This event is of a relatively large scale and is expected to be a grand occasion. The school has been established for many years and admits blind and deaf students, providing them with education and vocational training. The results have been remarkable, making it the most outstanding blind children's school in the city.

### After Dugue's Assassination; Body to Be Prepared for Coffin Tomorrow; Both of Dugue's Wives Are Deceased and He Has No Children

Mr. Dugue, Director of the Judicial Department and Legal Advisor of the French Municipal Council, was suddenly assassinated at the entrance of 24 Baisaizhong Road in the French Concession at around 7 PM the night before. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Commissioner of the French Consulate General went to inspect the body yesterday morning and performed a minor encoffining. The major encoffining is scheduled for tomorrow. At 8:30 AM that morning, the coffin will depart from Guangci Hospital, and a purgatory mass will be held at 9:00 AM in the Saint Peter's Church on Luban Road.

Dugue's Brief Biography

Dugue (Edouak d'Hooghe de lagranguerie) was born on July 27, 1873, in the city of Dunkirk to an old family of French lawyers and judges. After receiving a doctorate in law in his youth, he was sworn in at the Court of Appeals of the city of Douai and joined the city's bar association in 1893. After the start of the World War in 1914, he was mobilized and sent to the front lines of the French army to serve as an officer managing the ambulance corps. Later, he was assigned to serve in the commando unit in the city of Thessaloniki. Dugue was injured twice, the first time on August 19, 1914, and the second time on September 7, 1916. On January 15, 1919, he recovered and left the army with the rank of Major. After Dugue entered the judicial field and became quite well-known, he was sent to Morocco to serve in 1919. Later, he served as the president of the Havana City Court and then as the president of the Oudjda City Court. On September 9, 1922, he was promoted to advisor to the Saigon Court of Appeals and was repeatedly sent to Shanghai to serve as the presiding judge of the consular court and the presiding judge of the French Concession Mixed Court. Later, he served as the judicial advisor of the French Concession and was appointed as General Counsel on May 31, 1929. On March 13, 1930, he was awarded the Fifth Class Order of Merit. In 1934, he was promoted to Honorary President of the Court of Appeals.

Married Twice

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post, Mr. Dugue, the Administrative Director of the French Concession Municipal Council, was assassinated at the age of 64 at the entrance of his residence at 24 Baisaizhong Road last night (the 16th) after being shot four times. The French community in the city is filled with mourning today (the 17th). The French Concession Police Department is making every effort to investigate the case. It is widely believed that the case was politically motivated. However, the identity of the two assassins is unknown, and it is only known that they were wearing Chinese clothing. It has been learned that Dugue had been married twice, but both wives have passed away. He has no children or close relatives in Shanghai. The French authorities are currently preparing Dugue's funeral.

Long-Awaited Ambush

According to news this morning, for the past three weeks, Mr. Dugue had been going to Rosenthal's dental clinic at 788 Jing'an Temple Road for dental treatment every day between 5 and 6 PM. He went as usual last night and was assassinated on his return home at around 6 PM. It is generally believed that the assassins knew that Dugue went to the dentist every day, so they waited near Dugue's residence until almost 6:30 PM. When Dugue got out of the car, they fired four shots. Three bullets hit him, and one bullet fell to the ground. A Vietnamese police officer near the Xiafei Road heard the gunshots and rushed to pursue, but it was too late. The assassins likely escaped in a car that had been parked nearby. Official sources believe that Dugue's assassination was politically motivated.

### Rotary Club to Hold Regular Meeting Tomorrow; Christmas Program Added

The Rotary Club of Shanghai, following past practices, is scheduled to add a Christmas program to its regular meeting on Thursday, December 19th, at noon at the Metropole Hotel. The day is Women's Day, and all female members and their families in Shanghai have been invited to attend. At that time, the various proceedings will be led by Mr. and Mrs. Hawkings, members of the club. Young members of the church will contribute a game and sing "Carols". Dr. Shi Siming, a member of the club, will give a speech. It is reported that a large number of people are expected to attend that day. Members who invite guests or members from other cities to attend must notify the club secretary by telephone (16450) before noon on Wednesday to reserve seats.

### British-Owned Public Bus Raises Fares Yesterday; Company's New Fare Schedule Posted in All Bus Carriages

The British-owned China General Omnibus Company recently announced that it would raise fares again, starting yesterday, citing increased costs of imported materials and staff salaries as the reason for the increased expenses. The new fares for all bus routes have been printed by the company with revised station fares, which have increased from five cents to eight cents, and the highest fares have increased from 28 cents to 40 cents. Ordinary short-distance fares are now lower by rickshaw. The public considers public buses an important means of transportation for citizens. The repeated fare increases have increased the burden. Some citizens have switched to trams or walking to save money and hope that the company can rectify its operations and stop ticket sellers from skimming money, thereby increasing the company's revenue and reducing fares to ease the burden on the public.

### Establishment of Chinese Police Mutual Aid Association Unanimously Supported; Economic Stability Enables Dedicated Service; Business Community Sends Letter to Bureau Offering Assistance

According to key figures in the Public Concession Police, there are more than 5,000 Chinese police officers in the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Force. Due to the unusual circumstances, they are facing increasing economic difficulties and are eager to foster mutual assistance and understanding, as well as develop their personal careers. This is the main reason for preparing to establish the Chinese Police Mutual Aid Association.

Reduce Hardship and Work with Peace of Mind

When a reporter asked Deputy Police Chief Yao Zengmo about the initial stages of this matter, he said that he supports this initiative because it benefits the constables, who are now finding it difficult to cope with their common economic problems. The police officers maintain the law, which is a heavy responsibility. Therefore, methods must be found to help them eliminate economic worries. The police officers maintain law and order and perform their duties well, which largely depends on their economic status. If the Chinese Police Mutual Aid Association is established, it will be purely private and will have no relation to the Chinese police officers' public duties and responsibilities.

Unanimous Support from Chinese Directors

According to reliable sources in the police, the police stations have appointed representatives to form a committee to draft the association's articles of association. It must have a fixed fund of at least 100,000 yuan before it can begin work. Deputy Police Chief Yao did not disclose the points to which the Chinese police officers had already agreed. However, according to news received last night, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Municipal Council, has guaranteed one-quarter of the fund. It is reported that Chinese directors Xi Yushu and Yuan Ludeng are working with Yu Qiaqing to request public donations for the fund.

Definite Measures Have Not Been Discussed

Although the press has reported that the entire plan for the establishment of the Chinese Police Mutual Aid Association has been submitted by Yao to Police Chief Major Bagwen, Yao told reporters that no definite measures have been agreed upon. According to police sources, the Police Department has received letters of inquiry from several businessmen and expressed their willingness to cooperate with the authorities to assist the Chinese police officers.

### Passport Applicants Must Purchase Savings Bonds; Number of Bonds to Purchase

The visa office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong recently stipulated that all applicants for entry or transit passports to various countries must purchase National Construction Savings Bonds. Travelers from Shanghai via Hong Kong to other countries must purchase the number of bonds according to the regulations. The number of bonds to be purchased per application is listed below: (1) For those traveling to Europe, the Americas, and the Philippines: 100 yuan in national currency for a single person and 200 yuan in national currency for a family member. (2) For those traveling to various parts of Asia, such as the Dutch East Indies, India, Burma, Vietnam, and Thailand: 50 yuan in national currency for a single person and 100 yuan in national currency for a family member. (3) For those traveling through Burma or Vietnam to mainland China: 20 yuan in national currency for a single person and 40 yuan in national currency for a family member.

### Goods Detained in Vietnam to Be Auctioned Off

The Shanghai Xinleye Trade Association received letters from members yesterday, stating that they strongly agree with the proposal to gather cargo owners and send commissioners to Vietnam to handle the accumulated goods. Last year, this company entrusted the China-France Express Company to transport medicines worth 100,000 yuan in national currency. All of them are detained in Saigon. After repeated negotiations, no progress has been made. Recently, a letter from the East District Office of the Shanghai branch of the company stated that they received a telegram from the Saigon headquarters, stating that the Governor of Vietnam has ordered the auction of goods stored in Vietnam for transit. The proceeds from the auction, after deducting import taxes and other expenses, can be returned to the cargo owners. There is a definite possibility that the goods will be auctioned off. This matter is of great importance. Please immediately convene a meeting of all cargo owners with goods detained in Vietnam to discuss everything together and find a way to deal with the situation.

### Temperature in the City Suddenly Turns Cold

Since the beginning of winter, the climate in the city has been quite warm, with temperatures often hovering around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Unexpectedly, starting before dawn yesterday morning, the climate suddenly turned cold. According to sources at the Xujiahui Observatory, the temperature yesterday reached a low of 3.3 degrees Fahrenheit, which is more than 10 degrees lower than the low temperature of the day before yesterday.

The reason for the sudden cold snap yesterday is that the Siberian cold air current has reached Shanghai and the Yangtze River basin. This cold air current is expected to pass through the Yangtze River basin for two or three days. Therefore, the temperature in the city is expected to be even colder today and tomorrow. Due to the cold air current hitting Shanghai, winter winds have also occurred in the city. According to news received by the observatory, it has already snowed in Qingdao. However, after the sudden drop in temperature in the city,

the number of beggars freezing to death on the streets has also increased again. According to the Public Concession Pushan Villa, which received the bodies of those who froze to death from various places last night, there were 27 adults and 62 children. As of yesterday, the Tongren Fuyuan Hall in the French Concession had 17 adults and more than 40 children. The total number in the two concessions is about 150 people, of which more than 100 are children. Therefore, it is hoped that the homeless and orphaned children who are stranded on the streets will be rescued quickly.

### Six People Arrested in Nomura Assassination Case

Regarding the assassination of Japanese medical officer Nomura Nakmasa at the intersection of Tao Peng Road and Hua De Road on Monday (the 16th), the Japanese military police arrested six Chinese people yesterday on suspicion. All restrictions imposed on the area around the scene of the incident were completely lifted only yesterday morning. However, the murderer has not been arrested. The Japanese military police are continuing to investigate this mysterious assassination case, but have not requested assistance from the Public Concession Police Department or provided them with information.

### Shi Fuyuan Kidnapping Case; Five Criminals Arrested; Initiated by Sauce Garden Employees

The Xindefeng Sauce Garden at 137 Yuanfang Road was founded by Ningbo native Shi Fuyuan, who made a successful career. Recently, he was coveted by a bandit gang, who colluded with several rogues. At around 7 AM on the 15th, they drove to the entrance of the sauce garden with weapons and handcuffs, dragged Shi out, handcuffed him, and quickly drove him to a house prepared in the Jiangwan area of the Chinese Concession for imprisonment, demanding a large ransom. The Chinese and foreign detectives of the Hongkou Police Station learned of this and worked with the "Police Bureau" in charge of the area to rescue Shi.

Later, it was found that the kidnappers were hiding in Room 529 of the Dazhonghua Hotel at 200 Yu Qiaqing Road. The Chinese and foreign detectives went to the address and arrested five people: Guo Yunqing from Beiping, Xu Abiao from Ningbo, Bao Wenqing from Tongzhou, Fan Genfu from Taizhou, and Xu Wei from Xuzhou, and took them to the police station for detention. The police lawyer stated that the motive for the case was instigated by the defendant Xu Abiao, who used to be an employee at a sauce garden in the French Concession.

Knowing the Boss Well

Shi Fuyuan's background, reported to the defendant Guo Yunqing that Shi currently has 20,000 yuan in legal tender deposited, and instructed him to kidnap him. The defendants Fan Genfu and Xu Wei (both guests in Room 529) borrowed a car numbered 3794 from the manager of the hotel, Dai Buxiang, falsely claiming that they were taking a guest to Jiangwan, and carried out this matter. The driver at the time was the defendant Fan Genfu, and so on. As the victim Shi Fuyuan was not present in court, he requested a postponement of the investigation. When questioned, the defendants' statements were evasive. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled another hearing.

His name is currently being investigated.

### Qi Qi Road Incident: Schoolboy Rescues Himself from Kidnapping – Suddenly Abducted on Way to School, Kidnappers' Car Breaks Down, Boy Cries for Help and Escapes

Yesterday morning, an attempted kidnapping occurred within the French Concession. The details, as learned by our news agency reporter, are recorded below:

Abducted on Way to School

Zhang Bingzhong, an eleven-year-old Chinese student at the American School on Avenue Petain (now Hengshan Road) in the French Concession, originally from Jiaxing, resides at No. 228 Qiqi Road (now Qiqihar Road) in the French Concession. His father is currently a teacher at Guanghua University. Every morning, Bingzhong rides his bicycle to school. Yesterday morning at 7:30 a.m., after his usual breakfast, Zhang Tong set off for school by bicycle. Unexpectedly, after leaving his door only a short distance, four kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside, brandishing guns as a threat, and dragged Zhang Tong off his bicycle.

Escape En Route

After seizing Zhang, the four kidnappers forced him into a white-plated automobile, number 18827, which was parked on the side of the road. One of the kidnappers drove, speeding southward. Unexpectedly, after traveling only a dozen shopfronts, the car's engine malfunctioned, causing it to stop abruptly. One of the kidnappers inspected the engine carefully and discovered that the carburetor was broken, rendering the car inoperable. He then notified his accomplices to devise a plan. At this time, there were many pedestrians on the road. Zhang Tong, being alert, cried for help from inside the car. Realizing the situation was deteriorating, the kidnappers abandoned their hostage, deserted the car, and fled in different directions, disappearing without a trace. A nearby patrolman, alerted to the situation, arrived on the scene. Zhang Tong had already safely left the car. The police then took him to the police station to file a report and dispatched officers to escort him back home. The police station is currently investigating the case.

### Four-Year-Old Girl Suffers Abuse from Her Own Mother – Returned from Foster Care, Inevitably Estranged – Girl Adopted by the Jiliang Institute, Mother Sentenced to One Year in Prison

Zhou Xuefu, a clerk at the Jin Da Woolen Shop on Henan Road, and his wife, Zhang, reside at Room 418, No. 4, Lane 107, Henan Road. They have four children, the eldest being eleven years old and the youngest only two. However, Zhang is quite violent by nature. Their third daughter, Suzeng (four years old), had been fostered out elsewhere, and as a result, Zhang is inevitably somewhat estranged from her. Suzeng often urinates on herself, causing Zhang to routinely use

heated tongs to brutally beat the girl, leaving her covered in injuries. Housemates, unable to bear witnessing this, reported it in writing to the Lao Zha Police Station. West Detective Fang Tewahua, number 1013, investigated and confirmed the report's accuracy, arresting Zhang and sending the girl to the hospital. Examination revealed injuries to her face, arms, head, and other parts of her body. She also suffered from poor development and malnutrition. Yesterday morning, Zhang was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Bao’yi, charged her with violating Article 286 of the Criminal Law, abusing a male or female under the age of sixteen and hindering their natural physical development. Furthermore, personnel from the Jiliang Institute

noted that if the child were returned to her parents, she would undoubtedly not receive proper care or adequate medical treatment. Therefore, they requested permission to keep the girl at the institute. Zhou Sutang testified that her mother did indeed beat her frequently. When questioned, Zhang admitted that she occasionally scolded and hit the child for being naughty, but denied using heated tongs. Judge Xiao Xieffen stated that the current defective social system often treats children not raised by their biological parents as slaves, subjecting them to all sorts of abuse. Although the defendant in this case is the girl's biological mother, because she did not raise her herself, she callously

inflicted inhumane abuse on a child with no understanding. This is particularly egregious. Considering that there are still three children at home who need her care, leniency is granted, and she is sentenced to one year in prison, suspended for three years. If she does not repent, she will be severely punished. Subsequently, regarding the Jiliang Institute's request, the opinion of Zhou Xuefu was sought. Zhou believed that it would only be temporary adoption by the institute, and no fees would be required. When she grows up, she can still be brought back. Therefore, he expressed his consent. The court then ordered Zhou Sutang to be placed under the care of the Jiliang Institute. From now on, the child will no longer belong to the Zhou family.

### Businessman Commits Suicide by Slitting Throat Due to Poor Business and Excessive Losses

Xiao Pengnian, a 35-year-old from Yunnan, operated the Hongxingxiang firm at No. 9, Lane 300, Guangdong Road in the International Settlement. Recently, due to poor business and a sharp decline in his livelihood, the firm suffered significant losses, leading him to suddenly contemplate suicide. At 7:20 a.m. yesterday, he slit his throat with a razor and stabbed himself in the abdomen in the firm. Upon discovery, people immediately reported it to the police and summoned a vehicle to transport him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because the trachea had not been completely severed, his life was believed to be out of danger.

### Household Goods Exchange Holds Closing Down Sale for Charity

The Household Goods Exchange was originally established by the Young Women's Christian Association three years ago to meet the needs of displaced compatriots. Recently, the landlord reclaimed the open space in front for the construction of houses. As a result, the premises of the exchange are closed, and business cannot

be continued. It has been decided to temporarily cease operations starting December 10. Once the opportunity arises, it will be reopened. The stored goods, such as towels, piece goods, leather shoes, woolen fabrics, and various household items, will be sold at reduced prices on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd, together with the remaining items from the charity sale on December 8. All proceeds will be used for charitable purposes. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will visit on time and not miss this opportunity to purchase cheap goods, while also contributing to good deeds. This is truly a win-win situation.

### Re-Publication of Complete Book of Internal Medicine in Traditional Chinese Medicine

Traditional Chinese medicine is criticized in modern times for its lack of scientific spirit and its exaggerated talk of the Five Elements. However, the use of drugs and the treatment of diseases in traditional Chinese medicine rely on decades of accumulated experience and have their own unique aspects. Once various medicines are known to Westerners, they are adopted and refined, often with remarkable effects. This proves that although traditional Chinese medicine lacks scientific knowledge, its use of drugs can precisely treat the symptoms. Moreover, the practice of cooking and eating raw herbs demonstrates that even without the refinement of Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and its herbal remedies, if someone can organize them, can make a great contribution to humanity. Now, Nan Zongjing, a doctor from a family of physicians in Yongjia, has used the spirit of Western scholarship to organize the academic theories and proven formulas of traditional Chinese medicine, resulting in the two thick volumes of the Complete Book of Internal Medicine in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It has been on the market for many years and is now being re-published. The special price of nine yuan is available until the end of January next year.

### The Overseas Paradise Celebrates National Day – From Holland, Part One

Holland, a country with

a humble status, the collective name of the eleven provinces of the Netherlands is the Low Country, Nederland, and its essence is mainly concentrated in the provinces of North Holland and South Holland. The world calls these two provinces Holland. Amsterdam is the largest city in North Holland, and Rotterdam is the largest city in South Holland. Most of its government institutions are gathered in The Hague, Den Haag in South Holland. Amsterdam is the capital, and The Hague is the secondary capital. These major cities are all places where our overseas Chinese congregate. For nearly five months, news from the Netherlands has been scarce, but under the new laws, everyone has food to eat, and there is work everywhere. Even our overseas Chinese with limited financial resources feel like they are living in an overseas paradise. At the same time, the consular authorities, in this era of constant renewal, inevitably face increased responsibilities and more complex affairs. On the afternoon of October 10th, the “Festival Day,” the consulate held a grand National Day celebration. Dozens of Chinese community leaders attended. Chairman Consul Feng Jixiu led the community in paying respects to the portrait of the founding father and to the national flag, followed by an insightful speech. He briefly stated that today is the 29th National Day of the Republic of China. Since the founding of democracy in China, we have gone through many national crises. The difficulty of national achievements is like climbing a high mountain step by step. At first, it must be very difficult, but as long as we maintain optimism and perseverance, we will surely have a day of standing out. Afterwards, he reported on the recent progress of the motherland, urging the overseas Chinese to love the central government, be loyal to the motherland, and never abandon their original sincere and enthusiastic intentions. After the speech, guest speaker Wang Li Zhaoshi said that in extraordinary times, extraordinary talents are needed. Speaking of extraordinary talents, only Consul Feng is worthy of being selected. Now, the overseas Chinese are relying on the leadership of great talents, working tirelessly, and embarking on the bright road, which is very gratifying. He wished the consulate an upward development day by day, and wished our Republic of China an upward prosperity day by day. Then, a reporter delivered a speech, briefly stating that in this period of blackout, the heart will be panicked if you can’t see the light in the twilight. If you look up and get the illumination of a giant star, you will feel that you have a direction to go, and this heart will be stable. In extraordinary times, the people can only turn danger into safety and turn misfortune into blessing by believing in the central figures. Therefore, as far as the whole country is concerned, those who know that they have a firm belief in the leader of the country will surely prosper. As far as the small group of overseas compatriots is concerned, Consul Feng is the giant star illuminating under the blackout. If the compatriots want to get more benefits and light, they must rely on Consul Feng, who leads the overseas Chinese. Then, Zhang Guoshu, the owner of Het Verra Oosten restaurant in The Hague, gave a speech, the main idea of which was to compare the Republic of China to a nineteen-year-old young man who is working hard to move forward. He also quoted the saying "Those who have suffered the most suffering will be the best people," predicting that the Republic of China will surely achieve great prosperity in the future. According to the historical common law, all great talents have experienced worries and poverty. It is true that "Heaven will entrust a great task to this person, he must first suffer his mind, and exhaust his muscles." Afterwards, he listed the glorious historical facts of the overseas Chinese donating money to help Sun Yat-sen succeed in the revolution, which can echo Consul Feng’s encouraging words. The Hu僑 representative from the Municipality of Hattem, Yi Runting, from Tianmen, Hubei, gave a speech, first talking about current affairs, and then expressing his impressions. He briefly stated that there are governments that cannot be used, but there are definitely no people who cannot be used. For example, France, its literature, art, and science are all excellent, but the disadvantage lies in the people in the successive governments who are always wavering. Once something happens in China, the entire government is consistent and has no dissent. This is the advantage of China, and knowledgeable people can use it to predict the bright future. Just now, Mr. Wang of Wang Fu entered, saying that Consul Feng’s leadership of our overseas Chinese is outstanding in talent. It is right that we overseas Chinese can get light when we walk. Speaking of a country as a whole, if a national event occurs, the initial public anxieties are always that everyone feels that it is terrible, but when the government comes out to guide, it can be seen that everything has a solution. In small terms, for example, the overseas Chinese in Canada and Holland, no matter what difficult event it is, if they are busy holding meetings, they are often in vain and rarely successful. Only when the Consul comes out to deal with it is it effective. Mr. Feng is just like leading the bright future of our overseas Chinese. We rely on him to walk, and we can only believe in Mr. Feng to get the greatest comfort. Finally, Cai Jianmin, the executive committee member of the Overseas Chinese Association representing the city of Rotterdam, gave a short speech. The intention was to urge the overseas Chinese to put the country’s urgent needs first and then consider personal needs. At the end of the speech, he passionately shouted, “May the Chinese compatriots devote themselves to fighting for the country.” At two o'clock, tea and cakes were served. The setting sun was on the trees, and everyone returned home with great pleasure.

### Can't Catch Up!

Huang Yuqi was a chivalrous person. After hearing what Liu Rushi said, he said, "So he is also a remarkable person in the world. He doesn't seem like an ordinary beggar. I want to talk to him." As he spoke, he immediately walked out of the room. Shi Da had drunk enough wine and saw that Liu Rushi was busy entertaining guests. He originally wanted to say goodbye to Xu Da Niang and leave, but suddenly Huang Yuqi came over to greet him. Seeing that Huang Yuqi looked extraordinary, he also stayed to chat. After they talked, they felt like they had known each other for a long time. Huang Yuqi thought Shi Da was a brave warrior with courage. Shi Da also recognized Huang Yuqi as a talented person. Huang Yuqi wanted to introduce Shi Da to General Zuo Liangyu to find a way out so that he could make contributions. He made an appointment with Shi Da to meet at his hotel tomorrow and told Qian and Liu about his idea. Liu Rushi was very happy and happy for Shi Da. Shi Da didn't want to stay any longer, fearing it would be too formal, so he said goodbye and left. That night, Qian Muzhai set up a banquet in Rushi's boudoir to entertain the guests and ordered Xu Da Niang to prepare everything. When the guests had not arrived, Liu Rushi took many of her poems and articles and presented them to Muzhai for review. Each copy was transcribed very neatly. Qian Muzhai was very surprised after reading it and said, "Since Xie Daoyun and Li Yi'an, Liu Qing can be said to be the first." After deliberation, he slightly revised a few words for her, and Liu Rushi admired him very much. Liu Rushi asked him for several poems. Qian Muzhai stroked his beard and thought for a moment, then picked up his pen and wrote several poems. After Liu Rushi read them, she bowed down and said, "Lord Shangshu is truly the Li Zanhuang of this era." She personally served tea. Huang Yuqi greatly appreciated Liu Rushi's calligraphy and insisted that she write a couplet for him as a memento in the future. Liu Rushi could not refuse, so she ordered her maid to grind the ink, took out paper, and wrote a couplet in large characters. The upper line was "Shallow and deep green water heard in the zither," and the lower line was "Distant and near green mountains seen in the painting." She wrote in running script, which was graceful and pleasing. Huang Yuqi was overjoyed and said, "Liu Qing is multi-talented and more capable than a man. Hanging this in my study can make me proud of my friends." So he first pasted it on the wall. After a while, the guests arrived one after another. They were all local gentry and famous scholars from the she. When they saw the couplet on the wall, they all praised it. Zhang Tianru also came after hearing the news, but only Chen Wozhi did not come. Liu Rushi was somewhat unhappy, feeling that it was a big regret. During the banquet, Rushi's sisters toasted the guests, and they improvised poems while playing musical instruments and drinking wine. Liu Rushi sat next to Qian Muzhai, her white hair and rosy cheeks complementing each other, which everyone admired. Liu's sisters also composed poems on the spot while playing the drinking game. Zhang Tianru had always admired Muzhai, so he said to Qian Muzhai with a smile, "Shangshu, what do you think of my female disciple's poems? Please give me some guidance." Qian Muzhai smiled and said, "It is the work of a yellow silk young woman, only the most intelligent can do it. This is also due to Brother Tianru's teaching." (13)

### How to Adapt "Home"

— Shui Yuan

Everyone acknowledges that "Home" is a most inspiring and moving full-length novel. Its adaptation to the stage is an even more exciting and joyful event, as millions of "Home" enthusiasts will witness a more vivid and lively spectacle than the book provides.

However, how to adapt "Home," how to handle this five-hundred-page story, the long time span, the multitude of characters and settings, coupled with more complex facts? Restricted by the limitations of the stage, perfecting the adaptation without losing the original's essence is indeed a painstaking endeavor.

Why does Ba Jin's "Home" receive such warm welcome and readership among young people? If we understand this question, it will greatly aid in adapting "Home." The strength of Ba Jin's works lies in their ability to inspire and excite. Thus, after finishing his works, every young person has one feeling: "This is what I want to say." It's as if Ba Jin's pen represents the voice of every young person; he grasps their thoughts, understands their anxieties, and rescues them. And "Home" is the most realistic story depicting the activities of young people, coupled with his vivid writing style, which makes it especially beloved. Therefore, when adapting it to the stage, maintaining its consistent style and not losing the original's advantages, as well as not omitting any of the points that make it popular, will amplify its success.

What exactly does "Home" encompass? Of course, it depicts the collapse of the feudal system and the activities of young men and women within this society. Thus, the theme cannot be separated on stage. On the one hand, it continues to attack and condemn the old ethics; on the other hand, it portrays the arduous struggles of young people in a terrifying and difficult environment, inspiring the next generation of youth to advance on the unfinished road. Simultaneously, there is a meaningful implication, which is to project the current situation onto that time. The current environment is darker and more difficult, and the threat of dark forces is more severe than the old ethics and evil systems. Seeing the activities of young people at that time can encourage and alert oneself. Coincidentally, the ideal paradise for young people now is the opposite of that in "Home." Juehui's departure is also an allusion to the departure of young people in Shanghai to a brighter place, which can be used or emphasized.

However, I feel there is still one point. Although it only serves as a material for adjustment and increasing excitement, it can capture many readers or audiences. That is the joyful atmosphere in a large family, such as visiting the garden, boating, and even guessing riddles. For this reason, it not only adjusts the tragic atmosphere and dark scenes but also shows a group of young people's innocence. Therefore, this point cannot be omitted and should be included as much as possible during the adaptation. At the same time, the romance between Juemin and Qin, Juexin and Mingfeng are also good materials for performance.

Other secondary points that arouse readers' interest are the introduction of customs, describing the cruel, tiring, and unreasonable old systems in detail, such as the situation of the New Year, festivals, weddings, funerals, and celebrations. Of course, on the stage, one cannot bear to abandon these many ridiculous and hateful "monstrous shapes" and should satirize, scold, and even destroy them as much as possible.

Regarding the layout of "Home," it is mostly undulating, with one chapter writing about bright facts, followed by a chapter connecting to darkness. For example, immediately after writing about Xu Qianru's haircut and various progressive behaviors, the suicide of Mingfeng is used as a foil. They are both women, but their future endings are different. After Ruijue is killed by the feudal system, Juehui's departure is immediately followed, giving the feudal demons a head-on blow. The rest also echoes back and forth and is symmetrical. This style can be preserved on stage and can also enhance the effect.

Due to the excessive number of facts, some plots that are not of great importance to the overall situation may be deleted. And there are extra high points in "Home", I think the most suitable is to use "grandfather's death", and the ending is of course Juehui's departure.

In fact, due to the length of the plot, the above is just an opinion, and the specific adaptation method has not been explained in detail.

### Ge Hu Painting Exhibition

The famous painters Ge Xianglan and Hu Yefo are holding a Chinese painting exhibition for a week (from the 14th to the 20th of this month) in the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Da Xin Company. Mr. Ge is known for his good writing of horses and animals, and Mr. Hu is known for his good painting of ladies and landscapes. The horses written by Mr. Ge, whether standing, running, or neighing in the wind, are in thousands of poses and states, and even the smallest expressions are vividly displayed. They are truly excellent works of art. Those who love calligraphy and painting should go and see them.

### Monthly Consumption of 1.2 Million

— Pingfan

There are currently 28 cinemas in Shanghai that exclusively screen movies.

If a person wants to watch a film in every cinema:

The money spent is 16.2 yuan (based on the lowest seat price);

The time spent is 49 hours (based on 1 hour and 45 minutes per film).

If an average of 800 people fill each show in each cinema, then two shows have 2,400 people (less than 800 people in some cases, but many cinemas have to show four shows a day).

In this way, the total number of viewers in twenty cinemas a day is 67,200 people.

Based on an average seat price of 6 dimes, the daily expenditure is 40,320 yuan, which exceeds 1.2 million a month!

### Encouraging Zhou Xuan

— Min

According to "Haixing News Agency", the film industry is not "interested" in the election of the 1941 film queen, but Miss Zhou Xuan, the pillar of Guohua, was finally elected as the so-called 1941 film queen.

Zhou Xuan jumped onto the screen from "Mingyue" and "Xinhua", naturally not only because she has a natural singing voice. "Road Angel" has been recommended and supported by her peers and the audience, which proves that she has achieved success with her superb acting skills. However, since the national films "must sing in every film", the authorities seem to pay special attention to actors who can sing, not to mention that Zhou Xuan is the pillar of Guohua, and her "First Husband" is also Yan Hua who can compose music. Therefore, since "Meng Jiangnv", Zhou Xuan has to sing in every film, even three or four songs, such as "Sanxiao" and "Xi Xiang Ji", which has not yet been released, even adopt the "form" of "opera". But I have said that Zhou Xuan's success is not only based on singing. "In the ancient costume" period, she could not give full play to her strengths. Now that fashion films are on the rise, the company authorities who love her should produce several films that suit her personality, otherwise, love will be enough to harm her. At the same time, I hope that Zhou Xuan should not be complacent with her "Golden Voice", and "Queen" and the like are naturally not worthy of pride.

The copper picture above is "Street Angel" which she co-starred with Yun Guangzhao. I believe that Zhou Xuan will definitely live up to the expectations of the audience in this work.
