Madrid: According to local newspapers, before deciding on the armistice, France held a cabinet meeting that continued from the afternoon of the 15th to the late night of the 16th. Reynaud and others hoped the government would move to North Africa, but President Lebrun insisted on staying in the country. Finally, Pétain and Weygand threatened to resign, which ended the discussion and led to the decision to seek an armistice. (Reuter, June 20th)

Report: Peace Negotiations Concluded; Fighting in France Soon to Cease

Rome: According to a special correspondent of the semi-official Stefani News Agency in Berlin, peace between Germany and France has been concluded, and fighting will cease on Friday or Saturday. The French representatives have also returned to Bordeaux. (United Press, June 20th)

Italian Newspaper Comments on Armistice Terms: Strict Yet Fair

Berlin: The German official news agency reports from Rome that the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia commented on the Munich Conference between the two dictators, saying that while the terms proposed by Germany and Italy to France are strict, they will be fairer than the terms imposed at the end of the last war. One thing must not be forgotten: that the Treaty of Versailles deprived Germany and Austria of nearly ten million people of Germanic descent, and that all of Germany's colonies were seized. Although Italy lacks air space, its colonies were also seized, which must not be forgotten. The new European order will restore the equitable distribution of overseas territories and political balance, which are conditions for lasting peace in Europe and the world. (Reuters, June 20th)

Sourek: Reports from Rome and Berlin suggest that the Axis powers will not allow a ceasefire unless it is equivalent to France's complete surrender. According to an article by Mussolini's spokesman, Gaida, published in the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia, Germany and Italy will now double their efforts to attack Britain. Germany will attack northern Britain, and Italy will attack British positions in the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Near East. Whether or not the United States enters the war, Italy's attack on these areas will be successful. (Reuters, June 20th)

German Vanguard Enters Lyon; French Officials Continue to Serve

Lyon, France: The vanguard of the German army, advancing along the Rhine River, entered Lyon today. French authorities declared the city an undefended city and did not defend it. Regarding the German army's entry into Lyon, a newspaper reporter telegraphed Bordeaux to report to the government, saying that after the first German troops entered the city, only a few German trucks and tanks were seen on Rue de la République. The whole city was calm as usual. The Prefect of the Rhône, Paulaire, the Archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Charlier, and city officials continued to serve. Public utilities were not interrupted, but the streets were quite quiet. All police officers continued to patrol as usual, but their weapons had been disarmed by the German army. Soon, a large number of German troops arrived, and German troops guarded all bridges. Local authorities issued a public notice to reassure the people, the full text of which is as follows: "The events we expected have occurred. Lyon was originally an undefended city and has now been occupied by the vanguard of the German army. Their main force will continue to arrive. In this situation, our duty is to maintain dignity and remain calm. The authorities issued this notice for the safety of the city and the glory of the country. It is hoped that all citizens will be aware of this intention and will abide by the law and maintain order." This notice was jointly signed by the Prefect of the Rhône, Paulaire, the Vice-Prefect, Cohenthé, the Archbishop, Charlier, and the Secretary-General of the Association of Veterans of the Last European War, Vigal.

Marshal Pétain's Broadcast Address: States Reasons for Military Failure

Bordeaux: French Prime Minister Marshal Pétain said in a radio broadcast today: "The reason for our army's defeat is that our weapons and equipment were insufficient and we had too few allied troops. People of France, I have asked the enemy to end hostilities. The government yesterday appointed full-power representatives to accept their terms. This decision was made with the steadfastness of soldiers, because we were forced to do so by the war situation. We originally hoped to resist on the Somme-Aisne line. General Weygand had reorganized our army, and his reputation alone could predict victory, but the line eventually shifted backward under enemy pressure. Since June 13, it has been inevitable to request a ceasefire." Marshal Pétain continued to state the reasons for this, saying: "Previously, on May 1, 1917, after three years of hard fighting, we still had 3.28 million soldiers in arms. But on the eve of this war, we had 500,000 fewer soldiers than that. In May 1918, we had 85 British divisions to assist us; in May of this year, we only had ten divisions. In May 1918, there were still 58 Italian divisions and 42 American divisions. Our war materials were inferior to those of the enemy, even more so than our strength. French aircraft in combat were in a ratio of one to six with enemy aircraft. The French people do not deny the blows they have suffered. All people know honor and disgrace. They can react and express their own dignity. We will learn from the great defeat. After the victory of 1918, the desire for pleasure exceeded the spirit of sacrifice. The people needed more than they gave. Everyone wanted to conserve their own labor, and today disaster has befallen us. On the day of glory, I was with you. Now, on the day of darkness, I am still with you as the leader of the government. You are all standing by the roadside. The war is still going on. This is a struggle for France, that is, for the land of its children and grandchildren." (Reuters, June 20th)

French Government Leaves Bordeaux; Rumors of Relocation to Tunis, North Africa

London: According to reliable sources, the French government has left Bordeaux and it is not known where it has moved to. (United Press, June 20th)

Washington: According to authoritative sources here, the Army Intelligence Agency received a report last night stating that the French government has now moved to Tunis. (United Press, June 20th)

Bordeaux: German air fleets launched two air raids on Bordeaux and the banks of the Gironde River this morning, and it is reported that many civilians were killed and injured. The first air raid was at 1:00 AM. This was the most brutal air raid since the bombing of Paris. There were as many as 100 German planes flying over Bordeaux, dropping more than 100 bombs and incendiary bombs, and dropping the same amount of explosives on airfields, docks, and shipyards near the banks of the Gironde River. The first air raid was at 6:00 AM, but French fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns immediately resisted, and the German planes fled without being able to carry out damage work. (United Press, June 20th)

Bordeaux: The German government's reply received by the cabinet this morning did not contain armistice terms. Fighting on the front lines must be suspended only after an agreement is reached on the terms of the peace, that is, after a meeting of the full-power representatives of both sides. Therefore, the cabinet can now ignore the German terms or whether the fighting has stopped and directly appoint full-power representatives to negotiate with the Germans. A true armistice must wait a few days. Therefore, before the ceasefire order is issued, the German army may continue to advance, and the troops advancing in the southeast are likely to contact the Italian army before the ceasefire. (Havas, June 19th)

If Toulon Harbor is Attacked, the French Navy Will Defend It with All Its Might

Toulon Harbor, France: Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, issued a public statement today, saying that although the government has declared all cities and towns with a population of more than 20,000 to be undefended cities, Toulon Harbor is not one of them. Therefore, if the enemy attacks, our navy will defend it with all its might. (Havas, June 20th)

### German Military Report

Berlin: The German High Command announced this morning that Strasbourg, the capital of the French Bas-Rhin department, has been occupied by our army. (Reuter, June 20th)

Berlin: German officials announced yesterday the occupation of Strasbourg. The city has a population of 180,000 and was the earliest city established by the Germanic people. In 1250, it became a German free city. In 1681, it was incorporated into France under Louis XIV. At the end of the Franco-Prussian War, it was again incorporated into Germany as the capital of Alsace-Lorraine. Until the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles, the city was returned to France. The city's greatest feature is its magnificent cathedral, one of whose spires is 142 meters high, one of the tallest buildings in Europe. (Reuter, June 20th)

Hitler's Headquarters: This afternoon's German military report stated that the German army has occupied the key French naval port of Brest. The German army has reached the lower reaches of the Loire River. German planes continue to bomb enemy troops south of the river. Wherever the enemy troops try their best to resist, German planes are dispatched to assist the advance of the infantry. In northern Lorraine, the remaining French troops are trapped in the Moselle area, mostly between Épinal and Toul. Both places, as well as Lunéville, are in German hands. There is still fighting on both sides of Diedenhofen. Fast-bombing bombers and fighters destroyed most of the Maginot Line's projects. The German army entered Strasbourg from the southeast and captured more than 200,000 prisoners yesterday. General Altmayer, commander of the French 10th Army, and his chief of staff were captured. (Reuter, June 20th)

Berlin: German military experts recently declared in a supplementary communique that the remnants of the French army, chased by the German army, are now advancing further into southern France. According to the communique's comments, there are two noteworthy points about the German advance: Cherbourg, a key port with naval and commercial importance on the Norman peninsula, has been occupied. The remaining German troops have arrived at Le Mans, a key railway junction on the Brittany peninsula. Therefore, although threatened by the British army, both the Norman and Brittany peninsulas are safe. Cherbourg is an important naval base and occupies an important position in commerce, because the import of British coal must pass through this port, and this port is the terminus of several overseas routes. Le Mans is the former capital of Brittany and a railway junction, important for western France. Various equipment on the railways there was heavily bombed by the German air force a few days ago, so it is impossible for the French army to escape along this line. The battle report also stated that the German army has crossed the small town of Limoges and is advancing south. Between Le Mans and Limoges, the German army is now advancing downstream on the Loire River towards Tours and Nancy. In the Poitou region, the German army is advancing towards Lyon. German mechanized troops have crossed the Saône River and are heading south. These German troops will soon arrive on the banks of the Rhône River in Lyon. The Rhône River is a key transportation route in central and southern France. On the upper reaches of the Rhine, west of the Maginot Line's bag-shaped position and the Swiss border, the fighting is extremely fierce. The German encirclement of the French army is intensifying. The German cars advancing in Zifod in eastern France will soon make contact with the German army advancing on the upper Rhine. The Vosges Mountains are attacked from both sides, and the operation is successful. The occupation of Mösst is a clear example. French troops are now resisting on the Maginot Line north of Metz, but there is no hope of assistance. The Nancy battery south of Metz has been captured. The Saar River, which leads east to the Marne and Rhine rivers, has also been seized. Although the French army has repeatedly tried to break through, the result has been heavy losses. The fiercest fighting is now in the Voses area. A bag-shaped position seems to have formed in the [Vosges] theater. The French army along the Maginot Line and the French army on the upper Rhine are still trapped and will be annihilated. On June 18, the German Air Force cooperated with the Army, launched fierce attacks in the Maginot Line area, and fiercely bombed British airfields and oil depots on the Thames River. These two points are particularly noteworthy. The sound of explosions after the bombing was thunderous, and the raging fire can prove the success of the German Air Force. The bombing of British oil tanks is enough to make the British anxious, because since Italy entered the war, Mediterranean freight has been blockaded, and the supply of British oil has become difficult.

Editorial

### The Changing European War and the Eastern Moral Viewpoint

Germany and France have begun negotiations. Although the outcome is unknown, we very much hope that they will achieve near-ideal results. At this time, when no agreement has been reached, it can be said that the eight-and-a-half-month Western Front war has come to an end. France, which has always symbolized freedom, equality, and fraternity, will temporarily restrain its glory and turn to deal with the Nazis and Fascists. This is an extremely important turning point in modern history, and the world should not hesitate to extend the greatest sympathy to France and its people, who fought bravely but were defeated.

After more than a month of hard fighting, France's capital fell, its elite forces were wiped out, and the Maginot Line, which had always been regarded as impregnable, lost its ability to resist after the main force was defeated. Losing despite fighting is not a crime. The French soldiers and people made their best efforts to defend their country. Their final abandonment of war and reconciliation has inevitable difficulties, both internally and externally. Therefore, while issuing a call for a truce, they are still expressing that what they can accept is glory and not humiliation. The world should not find it difficult to imagine the difficult situation and internal pain of the French military and political authorities at this time. However, although France's main army was wiped out and most of its rich area was lost, is there really no other way to go except to abandon war and reconcile? Is it only by engaging in a truce that France's glory can be maintained? Judged by the standards of Eastern social values, one cannot help but feel a sense of regret amidst grief and sympathy.

Regarding the point of being defeated and surrendering to the enemy, the East has a different view from the West. The West focuses on reality, so defeat and surrender is a logical conclusion. The East admires ideals, so there is the doctrine of "better to be a shattered jade than an unbroken tile" and "resolutely die without yielding." Countless different styles can be found in the history of both sides. Judging with a fair eye, it is certainly impossible to rush to a conclusion, but there is no doubt that this style of the East is more magnificent and can better inspire the military and the people, and sometimes it can have the effect of turning danger into safety. The root cause of this is, on the one hand, the difference in moral standards between the East and the West, and on the other hand, the difference in views between feudal society and capitalist society. As William Hazlitt seemed to say: "The spirit of dying with composure is most abundant in barbaric nations; the higher the civilization, the more this spirit erodes" (roughly). And the spirit of "knowing that it cannot be done and doing it anyway" is a specialty of the East. It is no accident that the founders of major religions all came from the East. This spirit once influenced Europe with the spread of Christianity, and among the ancient Greek so-called "heathen" philosophers and certain scientists in the Middle Ages, one can occasionally see the existence of this temperament. However, since the rise of capitalism and the so-called modern culture has enveloped everything, people's consciousness cannot get rid of the influence of production relations. In that society where people calculate every gain and loss, emphasize efficiency, value reality, and only know how to obey vulgar laws, idealists are often ridiculed, and lofty ideals are often regarded as unrealistic. Therefore, superhuman miracles are rarely seen in today's era. This is certainly the result of the fact that human power has been relatively extremely reduced after the development of material civilization, but the main reason is still social relations. After the last European war, communism and totalitarianism arose, slightly showing some effect of spiritual inspiration. The strength and sharpness of Germany's combat power this time is partly due to this, but its foundation and influence cannot be compared to Eastern countries. As for the democratic countries where old capitalism is more dominant, the lack of this kind of martyr-like spirit is undeniable.

Strictly speaking, all of the above should be classified into the category of feudal morality, but this is the bright side of feudal society. Capitalism's elimination of this kind of virtue has been regarded as one of the reasons why it should be condemned. China has a longer period occupied by the feudal era in history than any other country, so its immersion in this moral tradition is also deeper. The doctrine of "achieving benevolence and taking righteousness" and the admonition of "never being complacent in the face of difficulties" have long exerted a religious-like power. By the time of the Song Confucianists, the theory of justice and reason was carried to the extreme, and morality and integrity were regarded as the highest model of human morality. Great feats of integrity and martyrdom, such as Tian Heng and his five hundred men, Zhang Xun, Xu Yuan, Wen Tianxiang, and Shi Kefa, occupy an extremely important position in Chinese history alone. These great feats cannot be found in today's capitalist society. In recent years, although China's ancient social system has gradually collapsed in the face of modern civilization, the stimulation of national difficulties has caused the old social morality to be combined with new national and ethnic concepts and re-emerge, becoming a vigorous and profound force. In the nearly three years of the War of Resistance, countless touching stories of men and women of integrity and martyrdom have been interspersed, especially soldiers, who are more heroic and commendable. There are very few acts that tarnish the country and the nation. Wu Peifu in the distant past and Zhang Zizhong in the recent past, although their ways of serving the country are different, both represent the righteousness of the Chinese nation. Yesterday's newspaper published a commendation by a certain Japanese spokesman praising the spirit of the Chinese army in the recent battle in western Hubei, which can further prove this. The reason why China's War of Resistance has been unyielding and has persisted to this day is partly due to the power formed by reason, and another part should be sought from the moral tradition in Chinese history.

This is not to emphasize the belief that spirit can overcome matter, nor is it to promote passive morality. The so-called spirit of martyrdom of "knowing that it cannot be done and doing it anyway" can sometimes only establish a valuable model and may not have practical benefits. At other times, it can break through the misfortune that everyone regards as irresistible with great determination and perseverance. In Chinese history, for example, Xie An and Xie Shi defeated Fu Qin, and Yu Yunwen defeated the Jin Emperor Liang; in Western history, such as the ancient Greeks resisting Persia, Rome defeating Hannibal, and in modern times Napoleon driving his army across the Alps, which had always been regarded as impassable, none of them succeeded by grasping the odds of victory. The achievements of several great scientists often went through the stage of being slandered, ridiculed, and even regarded as insane, and they finally succeeded by relying on their personal unyielding perseverance and struggling with the environment. However, within the scope of the country and politics and military affairs, what is involved is extremely complicated, and the will of the participating members may not be the same. It is easy to maintain a firm and consistent stance in a smooth environment, but in a time of crisis, it is often not controlled by a single will. It is most heartbreaking when success falls short. China also experienced extremely difficult times in the early days of the War of Resistance, but as a result, it was able to turn danger into safety and enter a smooth path with the extremely strong will of the highest authorities, which is what the Chinese people should be most proud of. At the same time, after the successive surrenders of large and small countries in Europe, it will undoubtedly make people realize the greatness and preciousness of the traditional Chinese spirit.

### Chinese Army on West Bank of Xiang River Achieves Victory: Recaptures Shashi and Enters Jiangling; Japanese Forces Completely Cleared from City; Fierce Fighting Near Shilipu; Another Chinese Army Approaches Jingmen

Chongqing – Regarding the recent situation of the battle on the west bank of the Xiang River, a certain military spokesman told a Central News Agency reporter that concerning Yichang, after Chinese forces abandoned Yichang on the 15th, they launched a fierce counterattack the following morning, and by 3:00 AM on the 17th, they had recaptured Yichang. On that day, Japanese reinforcements came to attack again, and on the 18th, the Chinese forces made a strategic advance, immediately deploying the strongest encirclement lines in the suburbs and continuing their counterattack. The Japanese retreated into the city, and after two days and nights of attacks, the Chinese forces made steady progress, approaching within one Chinese mile of the city. They are currently continuing their fierce attack, and it is expected that the remaining Japanese forces in the city will soon be annihilated. Regarding Shashi, starting on the 12th, large Chinese forces besieged Shashi, and the Japanese forces retreated steadily. Until yesterday, fierce fighting occurred in the suburbs, and by midnight, the remaining Japanese forces in the city were completely annihilated by the Chinese, who then recaptured Shashi. On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese forces seized the momentum and stormed into the city of Jiangling, wiping out the remaining Japanese forces. Regarding Jingmen, starting on the 16th, Chinese forces attacked the Japanese in Jingmen from the northeast and southwest directions. By the 17th, the Chinese forces in the northeast had recaptured two strongholds located eight kilometers from Jingmen. That afternoon, the Japanese launched a fierce counterattack, but were defeated by the Chinese forces, who then attacked in triumph, forcing their way to the outskirts of Jingmen. The Chinese forces attacking from the southwest also recaptured a stronghold located eight kilometers from Jingmen on the 18th. The Japanese forces collapsed and retreated into the city. The Chinese forces have advanced to the city walls and have established strong contact with another friendly army, jointly attacking Jingmen. It is judged that they will be able to capture it within a few days. Regarding Dangyang, the main force of the Japanese army is located near Dangyang, and they have taken a defensive posture within a thirty-kilometer area, attempting to resist stubbornly. The Chinese forces are bravely besieging from all directions. Although there has been no significant development in the past few days, they have successively entered areas five and ten kilometers from Dangyang. The Japanese are resisting stubbornly, and the battle is raging. Regarding Shilipu, Shilipu is the intersection of the Hanyi and Xiangsha highways. The Japanese are stubbornly defending this location, accumulating military supplies. Last night, the Chinese forces launched an all-out attack with the strongest forces, besieging from multiple directions. The Japanese army is already showing signs of collapse. Regarding the east bank of the Xiang River, the Chinese forces have successively recaptured key points such as Changshou Town and Fengle River, and are continuing to attack the Japanese river-crossing points, making great progress. At the same time, the Chinese forces attacking Hanyang have achieved initial victories. (Dispatch of the 20th)

Shashi – The Chinese army has been fiercely attacking Jing (Jiangling) and Sha (Shashi) for days, making rapid progress. After the brave and loyal Chinese soldiers captured Fahua Temple and Fuhetai (both on the east side of Shashi) yesterday, they continued their advance. In the afternoon of the same day, they forced their way into the city streets and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese. The Chinese army finally stormed into the city all at once after dusk on the 19th, wiping out the remaining Japanese forces, and completely recaptured Shashi, seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies abandoned by the Japanese army. At this moment the Chinese army is fiercely attacking a certain important point. (Dispatch of the 20th)

Shashi – After the Chinese army recaptured Shashi last night, they took advantage of the victory to advance towards Jiangling. They encountered the Japanese forces reinforcing Shashi from Jiangling in the area north of Jinlong Temple (north of Shashi), resulting in an engagement. Another Chinese army took the opportunity to circle behind the Japanese forces and launched a fierce assault directly towards Jiangling. The Japanese forces in the city responded hastily and were caught off guard. On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese forces broke through the defenses and stormed into the city, occupying key points within the city. A portion of the Japanese infantry retreated out of the city in disarray, while the majority were unable to retreat in time and gathered in the city, resisting stubbornly against the Chinese forces, who are currently conducting a fierce mop-up operation. (Dispatch of the 20th)

A Certain Location in Western Hubei – The Chinese armies in western Hubei have gradually completed the encirclement of the Japanese forces. Tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers who have broken into the Chinese encirclement between Yichang and Dangyang are now trapped in a desperate situation. In the suburbs of Yichang, Chinese and Japanese forces are still engaged in bloody battles, and the Japanese morale has been shaken. On the 19th, heavy rain fell again on the front line, rendering the Japanese aircraft ineffective. The Chinese forces are fiercely attacking on both lines, making rapid progress. The battle situation is about to undergo a rapid shift, entering a stage of absolute victory for China. (Dispatch of the 20th)

Yichang Battlefield – The bloody battles in the suburbs of Yichang are becoming increasingly fierce today. The Chinese army is besieging the Japanese from all directions, fighting bravely and advancing without retreating. Surrounded on all sides, the Japanese are being attacked from all directions and have no way to escape. They are currently still holding on to the highlands south of Dongshan Temple and various street corners, putting up a desperate struggle. The Chinese forces are giving them a heavy blow and will soon complete the anticipated annihilation. The Chinese army besieging Jingmen has continued to make progress. The highlands surrounding the city on all sides, such as Xishan (west of the city), Dongshan (east of the city), Wulidun (north of the city), and Wangbingshi (south of the city), have all been captured by the Chinese. The Japanese have launched repeated counterattacks, but have been defeated each time, and are lying dormant in the city, showing signs of disintegration. The Chinese forces are still attacking fiercely. (Dispatch of the 20th)

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman recently stated that Yichang has been lost and regained four times in the past four days. Although the city was occupied by the Japanese army again on June 18th, the fighting on the west bank of the Han River and the outskirts of Yichang has not ceased to this day. The main location of the current fighting is Dangyang, thirty miles northeast of Yichang, where the Chinese army is currently engaged in a fierce counterattack. The Chinese army initially decided to withdraw from Yichang on June 15th. Two days later, the city was recaptured by the Chinese army, and on June 18th, it was occupied by the Japanese army again. The main force of the Japanese army on the west bank of the Han River has now been surrounded by the Chinese army and will be completely annihilated by the Chinese army. Chinese troops have now occupied various ports along the Han River and a stretch of the Yangtze River ten miles northwest and southwest of Hanyang. In addition, the Chinese army recaptured Shashi on June 19th. (United Press Dispatch of the 20th)

Yichang Battlefield – The Japanese army gathered near Dangyang is attempting to hold on and resist stubbornly. The fighting has been extremely fierce in the past two days. The Chinese army, carrying out a brave encirclement, has a majestic momentum and invincible force. On the southwest side of Dangyang, the Chinese army recaptured Yuquan Mountain on the 19th and continued to capture the highlands around Caoanzi and Langzishan today. South of Changyang, the Chinese army captured Wandianzi on the 19th and is advancing fiercely northward today, successively capturing the line of Mujiajiang, Xijiajiang, Lijiajiang, and Zhoujiabang. On the southeast side of Dangyang, the Chinese army is continuously attacking the Japanese strongholds on the Hanyi Road between Dangyang and Herong, and the Japanese transportation has been cut off. In the northeast and northwest regions of Dangyang, the Chinese army has now recaptured the highlands around Xuyoushan, Tongshuya, Jiuzishan, and Dagutai. The Chinese armies of all routes have compressed the encirclement to an area less than ten kilometers in length and width. (Dispatch of the 20th)

### Advancing Japanese Troops in Southern Shandong Have Been Repelled

A Certain Location in Shandong – Since late last month, the Japanese, dividing into three routes, advanced towards the mountainous area east of Linyi in southern Shandong. The total number of Japanese troops was more than 2,000. One route advanced north from Qushan Town, one route advanced east from Linyi and Feixian, and one route advanced south from Juxian and Yishui. In recent days, the Chinese army has used clever deployments to inflict heavy blows on them along the way, capturing a large number of enemy soldiers. Now, after suffering this heavy blow, the majority of the Japanese on each route have retreated, and the Chinese are taking advantage of the victory to mop up the remaining Japanese forces.

### Order Restored to Normal in Conghua and Other Places

After the Chinese army recaptured Fengyuan, Jiekou, and Conghua City successively on the 12th, the Chinese took advantage of the victory to pursue the defeated Japanese troops and captured Fengyunling. The remaining Japanese forces fled towards Guangzhou. The Chinese army is tracking them closely and wiping out the area north of Shengang, while also clearing the battlefield and comforting the people. Currently, order in Conghua, Jiekou, Fengyuan, Fengyunling, and other places has been restored to normal. (Dispatch of the 20th)

### After the Establishment of the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Agreement: Lifting of the Blockade of the Tianjin Concessions; Everything Inside the Concessions Has Returned to Normal; Details of the Agreement Were Released in London the Day Before Yesterday

Tianjin – The commander of the Japanese garrison issued a notice this morning, declaring that the traffic control regulations imposed on the British and French concessions would be lifted at 6:00 PM today. A Japanese military spokesman claimed that the curfew would also be lifted, and the inspection sheds in front of the barriers would be gradually dismantled. The sentries in front of the barriers would be withdrawn after 6:00 PM, but soldiers at the boundary would remain stationed for a week to observe the amount of traffic but not control it, it was said. The British Consul-General, White, met with members of the press today and read to them the official British statement regarding the resolution of the Tianjin dispute. Mr. Donner, the Chairman of the British Municipal Council, told a guest that the British Municipal Council intends to hire a Japanese advisor to assist in matters relating to the Japanese. Further details could not be provided. (Reuters Dispatch of the 20th)

Tianjin – The blockade of the Tianjin concessions, which lasted 372 days, was lifted at 6:00 PM tonight. Free traffic between the British and French concessions and the surrounding areas has been restored. Before the official opening, a simple ceremony was held, during which a military officer inspected the Japanese guards lined up and addressed them, after which they withdrew. The spectators at the ceremony, mostly Chinese, with a small number of Japanese and foreigners mixed in, applauded to show their joy. Minutes before the opening, vehicles were blocked by barriers across the street, and long lines of pedestrians, bicycles, cars, and trucks piled up on both sides. Chinese police officers worked hard to direct pedestrians and vehicles to the side of the road before the official opening. At precisely 6:00 PM, the barriers across the street were removed, allowing all traffic to pass through smoothly in an orderly manner. Traffic was managed by Chinese police officers. Several Japanese soldiers stood on the sidewalk with fixed bayonets, watching everything. Yingzhong Street, which had been deserted for a long time, suddenly became active again. Cars and trucks full of Japanese people traveled back and forth like shuttles, as the restrictions on Japanese people passing through the barriers during the blockade were stricter than those on ordinary foreigners. Most of the Japanese people carried cameras and took many photos in front of the barriers and inside the concessions. It is expected that Japanese banks, companies, and shops will gradually move back to their old locations in the British and French concessions to operate, but there is currently no definitive news about this.

Tianjin – After the Japanese authorities here removed the blockade lines of the British and French concessions in Tianjin at 6:00 PM this afternoon, various vehicles loaded with food and other goods drove into the concessions like a tide.

Tokyo – The twelve-month-long blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin was officially lifted tonight. According to the semi-official Japanese news agency, the British concession authorities and the Japanese authorities in Dagu have reached a detailed agreement on close cooperation in suppressing all terrorist activities that impede peace, order, and the safety of the Japanese army. Both sides have agreed that the Japanese military police will provide information, and when the British Municipal Council police take action against suspected criminals noticed by the Japanese authorities, the Japanese military police will be present. This action will include the supervision of arms and explosives trading, the monitoring of printed materials, cinemas, and political gatherings, and the arrest and disposal of undesirable elements. The silver coins and silver bars currently in the Bank of Communications will be jointly sealed by the British and Japanese consuls-general and will remain stored in the bank. (Reuters Dispatch of the 20th)

Tianjin – The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese garrison here issued a proclamation this morning, stating that the Tianjin blockade of over a year would be lifted at 6:00 PM this afternoon. The proclamation also stated that all kinds of restrictions would be lifted because the Japanese authorities had reached a final agreement with the British authorities on the disposal of Chinese silver deposits in the concessions, and the purpose of the restrictions had been achieved. However, the proclamation also warned that the Japanese army would continue to monitor the situation within the concessions and would determine its policies based on the development of the situation. If necessary, it would restore all kinds of restrictions. According to a Japanese spokesman here, the curfew will also be lifted tonight. Japanese soldiers must still be stationed on the roads connecting the concessions at the entrances and exits to examine the amount of traffic, but not to manage the traffic. (United Press Dispatch of the 20th)

London – The Times editorial stated that the negotiations on the Tianjin dispute have been going on for a year, and the current resolution should not be used to draw any general conclusions, but it can eliminate the various causes of friction in the local area. Anglo-Japanese relations will therefore be improved, and the interests of the Chinese government have not been sacrificed, as the British consulted with the Chinese government at all times during the negotiations. The Chinese government will undoubtedly issue a statement on the issue in the near future. (Reuters Dispatch of the 20th)

Tianjin – According to the semi-official Japanese news agency, Japanese Consul-General Takeo has formally approved Japanese residents who wish to reside and operate in the British and French concessions, but they must register with the Japanese authorities. (Reuters Dispatch of the 20th)

London – The details of the Anglo-Japanese agreement were released here yesterday, and the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin is expected to be lifted today. The agreement stipulates detailed measures for the British concession authorities and local Japanese officials to strengthen cooperation to ban all terrorist activities that disrupt peace and the safety of the Japanese army. According to the measures, the Japanese authorities can notify British police officers to request the arrest of terrorists, and Japanese representatives can participate in the arrest operations. The transport of contraband and military supplies is also controlled by the Japanese. All publications and films must be censored according to the will of the Japanese. Anti-Japanese gatherings are also prohibited. Of the silver stored by the Chinese government in Tianjin, £100,000 will be used for disaster relief work, and the remainder will be stored in the Bank of Communications, sealed by the British and Japanese consuls-general. The above agreement also stipulates that the British authorities must not prevent the circulation of "Lianhe" banknotes in the British concession. The British Municipal Council will revoke the licenses of exchange shops established after 1938. The council will no longer issue new licenses to exchange shops without sufficient reserves. As for the difficulties arising from the agreement, they can be discussed and resolved by the British and Japanese consuls. (United Press Dispatch of the 20th)

London – In the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Agreement, regarding police and military affairs, it is stipulated that there will be closer cooperation between the British Municipal Council authorities and the Tianjin Japanese authorities to punish people whose criminal activities are related to Japan. Undersecretary Butler made a written statement on the agreement in the House of Commons yesterday, saying, "However, I wish to clearly state that in such cases, the necessary actions will be taken by the police department of the Municipal Council, and the administrative integrity of the British concession has been fully maintained in the agreement." The Japanese government claims that the silver stored in the Tianjin concession belongs to the people of North China and should be returned for events beneficial to them. The Chinese government claims that this silver belongs to the government and is part of the legal currency reserve. The current temporary agreement between the United Kingdom and Japan does not presume on this point of contention. Butler announced this agreement, saying, "The British government welcomes the conclusion of the agreement and firmly believes that it will facilitate the elimination of some of the suffering suffered by British and other third-party nationals and their business and maritime circles in China, and can show that the country and Japan can resolve their various disputes with patient negotiations." As a result of the conclusion of this agreement, the barriers around the British and French concessions in Tianjin are now being removed. One-tenth of the total amount of silver stored in various Chinese banks will be used for humanitarian affairs to relieve the disaster victims in North China, and the remainder will be sealed in various banks pending a decision on the final disposal method. Butler also said that the solution to this problem has been approved by the Chinese government. Chinese legal tender may still be used in the area under the jurisdiction of the British Municipal Council. However, "Lianhe paper money" has been used interchangeably with Chinese legal tender for some time in the past. The agreement recognizes this existing situation. You should know that the barriers built by the Japanese around the concessions have never been removed since the beginning of last year, and countless control regulations have been enforced on the residents. This barrier and the control regulations are now being eliminated. The Japanese authorities in North China also undertake to make efforts to curb anti-British actions or anti-British instigation in certain areas under their jurisdiction.

### Large-Scale Air Raid on British Mainland the Night Before Last; Fires in Three Towns in the Northeast; Billingham, a Center of Military Industry, Also Bombed

London According to responsible sources, the scale of the German aircraft raid on Britain last night, involving over a hundred planes, was unprecedented. Bombs were dropped across the country, and the enemy aircraft apparently changed their attack routes, increasing their attacks on industrial areas compared to the night before last. Several factories suffered damage, but given the large number of bombs dropped by the German aircraft, the extent of the damage was relatively light. Visibility was worse last night than on Tuesday, which was quite advantageous for the German bombers, as it made interception by the British side even more difficult. Furthermore, according to today's news, the British Air Force's attack on the French airfields used by the German forces was very effective. (June 20th, Reuters Telegram)

The British public is not alarmed by the German air raids of the past two nights and has requested the government to issue firearms today in preparation for hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Information Minister Cooper told the nation in a radio broadcast last night, "We will fight with our backs to the wall, but this wall is extremely strong." Last night, coastal troops gathered to prepare to resist the enemy, some of whom had fought with the German forces before. Coastal heavy artillery has been installed, with powerful anti-aircraft guns every mile. Areas suitable for German transport landings have been mined. The British Navy in the English Channel has concentrated a number of destroyers and reconnaissance ships as outposts for the army. The Royal Air Force has also greatly increased its defenses and patrols along the coast to monitor the movements of the enemy's navy. Civilians in the new war zone have been evacuated.

### U.S. Notifies Germany and Italy; Resolves to Uphold the Monroe Doctrine; Will Not Recognize the Transfer of Territories in the Western Hemisphere; Will Convene a Pan-American Conference in Cuba

Washington On Monday, when the United States warned Germany and Italy that it would maintain its Monroe Doctrine, Italian diplomats to Latin America issued a notice advocating the convening of an emergency meeting of the twenty-one republics of the Americas. Undersecretary of State Welles declared that the conference of the American republics will discuss the military and economic measures that countries in the Western Hemisphere should take to deal with the situation in Europe. In the notes delivered to Germany and Italy by the U.S. Ambassadors in Berlin and Rome on Monday, it was stated that the United States will not stand idly by if any non-American colony in the Western Hemisphere is transferred to another non-American country. Political observers explained that this statement meant that the United States will take action to prevent Germany or Italy from controlling any French or Dutch territories in the Western Hemisphere. The Secretary of State declared last night that on June 16, Secretary of State Hull instructed the Chargé d'Affaires in Berlin and the Ambassador in Rome to deliver the following note from the U.S. government in writing to the Foreign Ministers of Rome, Germany, and Italy: [The U.S. government is aware that France has requested Germany to offer conditions for a ceasefire. To avoid possible misunderstandings, the U.S. government deems it necessary to state the following.] Based on the U.S. policy on the Western Hemisphere, the United States will not recognize, nor will it permit, any Western Hemisphere territory to be transferred from a non-American people to another, including Greenland. Recall that President Roosevelt expanded the Monroe Doctrine to Canada in a speech he gave two years ago. Currently, Britain, France, and the Netherlands all have many colonies in the Western Hemisphere, and only France has made peace with Germany alone. The United States is most concerned about French territories, including important islands off the coast of Newfoundland, French Guiana, and several islands in the Windward Islands. A State Department spokesperson indicated last night that the United States expects Germany and Italy to reply to the note. However, some officials believe that the totalitarian countries, or one of them, will make a formal official statement. (June 20th, Associated Press Telegram)

Chicago General Johnson, a senior U.S. Army officer, stated that South and North America have a weakness in terms of defense, namely the Panama Canal. If the United States is determined to defend the Western Hemisphere, it is necessary to consider how to protect the food supply for U.S. troops and [allied troops]. Although the United States does not intend to send an expeditionary force to Europe, it has confidence in defending the Western Hemisphere. In other words, when necessary, U.S. troops can go north to Alaska and south to Chile and southern Argentina. (June 19th, Haitong Telegram)

### Japanese Military Advocates Intensifying Threats Against Vietnam; Repeatedly Makes Four Demands to France; France Has Agreed to Allow Japanese Inspectors

Tokyo Newspapers here continue to report news about Japan's attention to Vietnam. It is said that yesterday, Minister of Colonial Affairs Koizumi, when meeting with Prime Minister Yonai, suggested that in order to strike at the China aid route, the military is now urging Japan to take appropriate and effective measures. If necessary, force should be used.

According to the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, French Ambassador Henry informed the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs that although the shipment of gasoline and motor trucks from the United States to Chongqing is, in fact, a common trade, the French government has taken steps to tighten the prohibition since June 17. It is heard that the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, in order to establish concrete measures to achieve genuine results, hopes that: (1) the Vietnamese authorities will prepare a form listing the gasoline, motor trucks, railway materials, etc. currently in stock for submission to the Japanese authorities at any time; (2) Japanese military officials should cooperate with the Vietnamese authorities to investigate the stored goods and transportation situation; (3) Japanese border patrols will cooperate with officials in Hanoi, Lao Cai, and [an unknown name] to monitor the transport of goods across the border; and (4) if the above measures fail to achieve their purpose, the Vietnamese authorities should close the border.

### Generalissimo Chiang's Speech - Full Text

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Speaking of the recent Japanese
bombing of Chongqing, it can be said that the Japanese have exhausted their greatest and final strength to attack us. The Japanese aim is to believe that Chongqing, threatened by them, will cause our government to waver, our people to feel threatened, and social order to be disrupted, thereby shaking our will to resist and even surrendering to them. That is their goal. Therefore, every time they exhaust their resources, they send at least one hundred and ten aircraft, and as many as one hundred and sixty, to bomb Chongqing. Each aircraft has an average of at least five to seven people. That means the number of people who invade Chongqing with the full force of their air force every day is as high as over one thousand, and at least seven or eight hundred. It really is using their greatest and final strength. And what is our air force doing to resist the Japanese? To be honest, we only need to use a very small number of aircraft from our air force every day, and every time we shoot down or wound a large number of Japanese planes, never letting them return as a complete team. As for these Japanese planes that have been shot down, at least two and as many as five are shot down every day. According to the Japanese own broadcast, in addition to those shot down, each time at least a dozen aircraft are damaged by our air force planes. According to ordinary air force combat theory, at least three fighter planes are needed to fight one bomber plane. But now we only use one fighter plane to fight against five or more enemy bomber planes, and each of our fighter planes has to fight continuously with five times or more of the enemy's strength for three to six hours. This means that our air force engages in five or more fierce battles with the Japanese army every time it takes off. Moreover, after each battle, at least two-thirds of the planes in each team are hit by Japanese gunfire. There was even one time when Comrade Wen Zhi’s plane was hit by ninety-nine bullets plus one shell. In addition, countless planes were hit by more than forty bullets. However, what is the extent of the damage to our air force? It's truly unbelievable. I can report responsibly today that in the two months of combat of our air force, except for a few losses last month, since this month, in the past two weeks, not a single one of our air force soldiers has suffered any significant serious injuries, and not a single plane has failed to return safely after loyally and courageously completing its mission. Just like yesterday, when the Japanese again sent more than one hundred and twenty aircraft to invade Chongqing, we shot down six with only a very small force. This is only based on what has been detected and discovered so far. The number of other planes that were shot down by our army in the distance and have not been identified, and the number of wounded, are not included in the calculation. Therefore, judging from the battle situation in the past few days, we only need to use a very small number of air forces to resist the large number of Japanese planes that invade every day, and we can achieve great results every time. I think that apart from China, there is no other air force in the world that can fight ten against one, and achieve more with less. Now, let's calculate the number of Japanese and our deaths in these air raids. In the past week, on average, four Japanese planes have been shot down by us every day. The valuable and rare air force personnel they have trained at great time and effort die in battle at a rate of at least twenty to thirty people per day. And because Chongqing’s air defense facilities are becoming safer and stronger day by day, and due to the efforts and dedication of general protection and rescue personnel during air raids, the innocent compatriots who are tragically bombed to death, according to the statistics of the past week, range from eight to forty-eight people per day, with an average of no more than twenty people per day. Comparing the loss of life of our ordinary soldiers and civilians with the number of casualties of the Japanese air force personnel, we suffer fewer losses of life than the Japanese. And in terms of material consumption, considering the consumption of Japanese aircraft fuel and bombs, and the destruction of our urban houses and equipment, the Japanese losses are even greater than ours. To sum up, since these air raids, the losses we have suffered can definitely offset the losses of the Japanese. Moreover, the damage and casualties suffered by the Japanese air force actually exceed ours by more than thirty percent. Therefore, the Japanese invasion by air force not only fails to shake us in the slightest, but also results in them not getting what they paid for, and only hastens their own defeat. From this alone, the Japanese should know that using their air force to threaten and subdue our government and people is like shooting at the sky, just wishful thinking. And if our comrades and the military and civilians across the country can all take the spirit of our air force's victory with few over many in these few days to resist the war, build the nation, handle politics, develop the economy, and engage in various social undertakings, and if everyone can be like our air force soldiers, able to use the strength of one person to fight against thirty or even more than one hundred Japanese people, then no matter how the Japanese use all their final strength to try to succeed, they will inevitably be eliminated by us. There is no way we cannot achieve final victory. Secondly, during this air raid, in addition to the air force personnel being able to loyally and courageously exert themselves and truly complete their mission, other party, government, military, and police personnel, as well as youth groups and air raid service teams organized by various sectors of society, protection groups, rescue teams, fire brigades, traffic teams, soldiers, police, and even monk and Taoist teams, can mostly demonstrate the spirit of loyalty, courage, and sacrifice, and fulfill their duties and obligations. This is something that I find very comforting. It can be said to be the most glorious page in our history of resistance. Today, as our victory is getting closer and closer, and as we are about to succeed, if our party, government, military, police, and compatriots from all walks of life can become stronger and more courageous as we fight, we can be confident that not only will the Japanese be defeated, but any country in the world will also understand that the Chinese government and the Chinese people cannot be threatened by any force. All our strength has not yet been fully exerted, especially the senior cadres of various departments, ministries, and offices, who must work harder to fulfill their responsibilities. You must know that the length of our individual abilities and the strength of the nation are to be experienced in such dangerous times and extraordinary circumstances. Therefore, the more critical the moment and the more dangerous the situation, the more we must strive for our spirit and the more intensely we must work. But now there are still a few agencies that seem to be able to relax a little, and they do not even inspect and supervise the work of lower-level personnel, which is completely wrong. Our air force and rescue personnel risk their lives to protect our safety and relieve the suffering of our people. If the responsible comrades in our various agencies, especially the senior officials in various departments and ministries, still cannot do their best, use their time, step up their work, and effectively direct and supervise their subordinates, and fail to exert their talents during this dangerous period, then they have neglected their duties and are not worthy of being the chief officials of modern agencies. You must know that the reason why ordinary civil servants became bureaucrats of a fallen country during the fall of the Qing Dynasty was because they could not remain calm in the face of danger. When they encountered danger, they wavered in their hearts, the order became chaotic, and they even abandoned their posts and fled first. Therefore, they became the government of a fallen country. The officials of our revolutionary government must be able to cultivate their spirit and strive to fight. I hope that all responsible comrades will not miss this opportunity to hone their knowledge and create achievements. Even under the mad bombing of Japanese aircraft, they must be able to use the opportunity, exert their abilities, lead by example, lead their subordinates, improve our work efficiency, and enhance our national strength. In the future, during the Anti-Japanese War, as long as it is related to our duties, the chief officials of various departments and ministries should automatically plan and assist, without waiting for requests from lower-level agencies, the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government, or the Public Security Bureau, in matters such as relief, transportation, and markets. Our主管 officials should automatically study, try their best to deal with the solutions, and seize this opportunity to implement the Three Principles of the People and save the country and the people. In particular, the President of the Executive Yuan, the Military Commission, and the chief officials of various ministries and commissions must distinguish between the situations, double their efforts to promote our business, and do not allow our revolutionary spirit to be relaxed in the face of the Japanese aircraft's fierce flames. The Japanese think that after this bombing, we will feel panic and waver, but they can only destroy our houses and thin tiles, and they will never be able to shake our spirit of resistance. Now, even if our office buildings are bombed by Japanese aircraft, we can use this to inspire our life spirit and step up our work of resistance. Even though the buildings of our National Government are destroyed by Japanese aircraft, we are still holding our weekly memorial service for the Premier within the walls of the National Government. Even if the entire city is completely shattered by Japanese aircraft and turned into ashes, our National Government will still hold all meetings here. We are going to use blood and fire to temper our national intelligence and nourish the vitality of our great nation. In this way, our revolution can be completed and our Chinese nation can forever stand in a steadfast, independent, self-reliant position. (To be continued)

### Japanese Plane Raids on Chongqing - More Harm Than Good

Chongqing - Chinese officials today claimed that each Japanese air raid on Chongqing costs the Japanese 40 million yen, while the losses to the Chinese government and military facilities this summer are minimal. The scale of Japanese air raids on Chongqing this year is greater than any time since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, but most of what the Japanese planes have bombed are old and poorly constructed civilian houses of the local people in western China. This kind of loss makes the Japanese lose more than they gain. Chinese government agencies and factories are scattered in the suburbs of Chongqing and have not suffered losses from Japanese bombing. The factories have moved from the capital to deep caves, beyond the reach of Japanese aircraft bombs. In addition to the loss of civilian houses and shops, this year Japanese planes have bombed and destroyed foreign property in Chongqing. The French St. Paul's Catholic Church and the girls' school run by the church in the suburbs of Chongqing were completely bombed on Sunday. The Christ Adventist Sabbath Church and the Methodist Church run by Americans were destroyed and have not been repaired. An ice factory run by Americans was damaged by bombing on Sunday and was forced to suspend operations this week. The Canadian church was destroyed. German property, including Tongxun News Agency and the German Wohrf Steel Factory, the Soviet Embassy in Chongqing, and TASS were all destroyed. The Chinese government said that after learning from the lessons of the Japanese air raids on Chongqing, it made adequate preparations for the air raids this summer. Even during the Japanese air raids, it continued to work and did not completely shut down. The morale of the people of Chongqing was not affected by the Japanese bombing. Most of the people have already evacuated, and those who remain seek refuge in caves. The people of Chongqing have become accustomed to "bombing life." The reduction in casualties this year proves the effectiveness of air defense. Chinese officials estimate that each Japanese air raid on Chongqing costs the Japanese 40 million yen. This figure is estimated based on the loss of aircraft, the death of pilots, and the consumption of gasoline and bombs. This figure is based on 100 aircraft. However, this year, the Japanese planes that attacked Chongqing often exceeded 100. Chinese military officers estimate that each Japanese air raid on Chongqing requires 70,000 gallons of gasoline, worth 210,000 yen. The bombs dropped by Japanese planes are worth 200,000 US dollars. Each air raid, the Japanese planes lost an average of five aircraft, each worth 300,000 US dollars. In addition to the above-mentioned losses of 30 million US dollars, the Japanese pilot training costs and other expenses totaled 10 million US dollars. Since April this year, Japanese planes have attacked Chongqing an average of 160 aircraft, which is three more than last year. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

Chongqing - The Chinese Air Force recently announced that from May 20 to June 16, Japanese planes attacked Chongqing a total of 12 times. A total of 29 Japanese planes were shot down by the Chinese side during the air raids. In addition, it was reported that 40 other planes were also shot down, but the wreckage of these planes could not be found. A total of 203 Japanese airmen were killed, and seven Japanese airmen were on board the damaged planes. During these 12 air raids, the Japanese lost 1.1 million and 300 US dollars, while China lost 400,000 and 8,000 US dollars. Only four Chinese fighter planes were shot down, and nine were damaged.

### Foreign Troops Stationed Here Will Not Withdraw; Shanghai Concessions to Maintain Status Quo; Idea of Free City Criticized by All Parties; Rumors Should Not Be Believed

Due to the impact of the European war expansion, some people in this city, who only seek their own interests and disregard the overall situation, are repeating old tunes and even suggesting the establishment of a "free city." The saying that this plan has been discussed by the consular corps is actually a private plan of wishful thinking. The consular corps has not discussed or considered it at all. According to sources from the Public Concession Authority, the consular corps and the Municipal Council are not aware of this matter. According to sources close to the French Concession, the French Concession Authority has never heard of any brewing of the Shanghai Concessions to be converted into a "free city." In addition, various diplomatic authorities stationed in Shanghai that have interests in Shanghai also believe that this is a private proposal. There has been no involvement or contact regarding the so-called "free city" in the Shanghai diplomatic community, and it is believed that the plan will never become a reality, because any changes involving Chinese territorial sovereignty cannot be recognized by the Chinese government.

Foreign Defense Forces Will Remain Stationed As Usual

Under the instigation of a certain party, the puppet mayor Fu Xiao'an sent letters to the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai, requesting the withdrawal of the defense forces stationed in Shanghai. According to foreign diplomatic authorities in this city yesterday, the British and French defense forces stationed in Shanghai will remain stationed as usual and will not withdraw. The British, French, and Italian defense forces in this city, through the mediation of Admiral Heard, commander of the US Asian Fleet, have decided to jointly maintain the status quo. All incidents that could cause friction have been stipulated and every effort is made to avoid them. Therefore, there is no reason to withdraw.

British Consul Says He Has No Right to Investigate

Mr. George, the British Consul General in this city, said yesterday that he has not yet seen the official letter sent by "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an to the consuls of Britain, France, and Italy requesting the withdrawal of troops. Mr. Fu's letter was written in Chinese, and he has not yet instructed the translators to translate it into English. All he knows comes from the newspapers. In any case, he has no power to speak about the withdrawal of troops. Mr. George said that the question of the withdrawal of troops of any nationality from the two concessions must be decided by the government authorities of those countries, and not by the consul acting on their behalf.

Chinese Side Refutes the Establishment of a Free City

After the suggestion of establishing a "Shanghai Free City" was revealed in the newspapers, all parties have pointed out that it is impossible and would harm the integrity of Chinese territorial sovereignty, which the Chinese government would never agree to. The legal status of the concessions is different from "leased land." To be precise, they are only "residential areas" for foreigners, and sovereignty still belongs to China. This is the first point. Secondly, in terms of the current situation of the concessions, neutrality has already been established, so there is no need to do so. It is even less possible in reality. The consular corps pointed out again yesterday that this plan has no value. Mr. Nirone, the Italian Consul General who is currently the leader of the consular corps, is unwilling to express his views on this matter due to environmental reasons.

Normal Quiet Within the French Concession

Since the Japanese side's ambitions towards Annam were exposed, the situation in the South China Sea has suddenly become tense. In this city, there are also many rumors about the French Concession, which are unfounded. The puppet side's bluffing is definitely an important factor in creating these rumors. As for the situation in the French Concession, according to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who inquired from sources close to the authorities, "Everything in the French Concession is as usual. The rumors outside are not to be believed." There are even rumors that puppet troops are gathering in the suburbs. According to information from the Chinese in the western suburbs, there have long been puppet troops outside the concessions. More than a dozen Japanese tanks are south of the Jinji Bridge in the South City, which have been common since the Chinese army withdrew. The various rumors are the result of paranoia and nothing more than self-disturbance.

Misunderstanding in the Xujiahui District

The English Great American Evening Post said that today (20th) there was a misunderstanding in the Xujiahui district between three Japanese military policemen and the French Concession police. The incident occurred when the Japanese military police left Jiaotong University (now occupied by the Japanese army) and attempted to cross the border to a refugee shelter on Haige Road nearby. They were stopped by the French Concession police. However, they soon realized that the Japanese military police were within the Japanese military area and allowed them to proceed. When the Japanese military police were stopped, 80 Japanese soldiers arrived at Jiaotong University. It is believed that these Japanese soldiers were sent to strengthen the garrison there. There are rumors circulating today that the Japanese authorities near Xujiahui are planning to block access to the French Concession. However, the French police authorities said that this morning's incident was due to a misunderstanding and has now been resolved amicably. There are many rumors in the city now, and the citizens should ignore them. The Zilin West News reported that the spokesman for the Japanese army in this city replied to reporters yesterday (19th) afternoon that he did not know about the rumors that the Wang's troops were gathering in the South City. He believed that this was a fabrication. The spokesman for the Japanese Embassy also said that he had heard rumors that Japanese vehicles were active near the border of the French Concession and that Wang's troops had appeared in the suburbs of this city, and that the number of these troops had been exaggerated. In fact, these rumors were baseless, and the Japanese authorities had no intention of taking over the French Concession.

No Possibility of Returning Archives

According to the opinion of senior officials of the Municipal Council, the Bureau will feel some difficulties regarding Fu Xiao'an's request to return the Land Bureau archives, because these archives were entrusted to it by the Chinese government, and the so-called "municipality" has not been formally recognized by any country. In general, it is believed that Japan will not be willing to stand aside in this case, and that it is a possible cause of obstructing peace and order in Shanghai. The "Mayor" recently expressed his opinion in an interview with Western reporters that the reason why the Municipal Council refused to hand over the Land Bureau archives was to protect certain foreign businessmen, because these foreigners had come forward on behalf of Chinese properties during the Shanghai War to find out the truth. This case is currently being discussed by various foreign consuls in this city, and many of them do not agree to handing over the land archives immediately.

### Yunfei Fires Drivers

The labor representatives of the four major taxi companies in this city, Yunfei, Xiangsheng, Yinse, and Tailai, negotiated again with the Yunfei capital representatives regarding the dismissal of 17 people, including driver Xu Binggao, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, but with no results. It was decided that the two sides would negotiate again on the 21st of this month.

### Cancellation of Haiphong Blockade; Shipping Industry Unable to Confirm; Yisheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson Sailed for Hong Kong Yesterday; Whether to Sail to Haiphong Will Be Decided Upon Arrival in Hong Kong

Japan's southward ambitions, due to France's declaration of armistice, have turned into a more active accumulation. The French authorities, in order to be cautious and defensive, have temporarily blockaded Haiphong in Vietnam, and all ships are prohibited from entering and leaving. There are rumors that the Haiphong blockade has been lifted as of yesterday, but the shipping industry has not confirmed this. Although the Yisheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson departed as usual yesterday, it was limited to sailing to Hong Kong. Whether it can sail to Haiphong will be decided depending on the situation. As for the Southwest postal route, there is no worry about interruption. Details are as follows:

Rumor That Haiphong Blockade Has Been Lifted

After the sudden changes in Europe, the impact has also caused unrest in the Far East. The fall of Paris and the peace talks in France have made the southward ambitions of ambitious people even more active. Japanese foreign telegrams reported that more than 60 Japanese ships were gathering in the sea off Hainan Island. Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita also issued a final warning to French Ambassador Henri, so the situation in Vietnam is clearly tense. The French authorities, in order to take cautious precautions, announced the blockade of Haiphong from the day before yesterday, prohibiting ships from entering and leaving. Yesterday, it was rumored in this city that the Haiphong blockade had been lifted by the French authorities, but according to inquiries from the Daguan News Agency to the shipping industry, no official telegram has been received, so it cannot be confirmed.

Yisheng Set Sail and Temporarily Sailed to Hong Kong

The British Jardine Matheson Yisheng Wheel in this city was originally scheduled to sail to Hong Kong and Haiphong yesterday morning. The Haiphong passenger tickets that had been sold and the goods that had been loaded for Haiphong were suddenly notified of the closure of Haiphong by the Haiphong branch the day before yesterday, so they immediately processed the refund procedures and the goods destined for Haiphong were also cleared for refund, preparing to suspend sailing to Haiphong. It will be decided after arriving in Hong Kong, it was said. In addition, the Mingsheng Wheel of the company is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 26th and will also temporarily sail to Hong Kong. As for the Taikoo Ocean Wheel Jinan Wheel's export on the 19th, whether it can reach Haiphong must also be decided after the whole port arrives in port. Also, according to news from Hong Kong yesterday, the Hong Kong-Vietnam route was reopened the night before last (19th) due to the cancellation of the Haiphong blockade, but the shipping industry in this city had not received the above news yesterday, and confirmation is awaited.

Southwest Postal Delivery Not Interrupted

As for the postal delivery between Shanghai and Vietnam, it was interrupted the day before yesterday due to the suspension of the ship. Haiphong was originally an important transshipment port for mail between Shanghai and Yunnan, Sichuan and other places. At present, ordinary letters are still sealed and issued as usual, but the Bureau can change the route of mail to the mainland to Zhejiang East when necessary, and load the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to transport to Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan and other provinces for delivery, which is also very convenient, and the time required is similar to that of those via Haiphong, so there is no worry about the interruption of postal delivery between Shanghai and Southwest.

Parcels Via Haiphong for Transshipment Temporarily Suspended

Shanghai Postal Administration Parcel Stock Notification No. 208: It has been notified in the Parcel Notification No. 202 that the collection of bulk parcels and bulk small parcel mail to Yunnan and its upper reaches has been suspended. Due to transportation difficulties, all parcels and small parcels of all kinds sent to Yunnan and its upper reaches via Haiphong for transshipment should be temporarily suspended.

### Establishment of New Organization by the Public Works Department to Manage Special Prices and Suppress Merchant Speculation in Cooperation with the French Concession

The Price Stabilization Committee for Daily Necessities in the Public and French Concessions has decided to establish a liaison mechanism to adopt cooperative measures to stabilize prices. Dr. P.H.B. Petersen has begun preparations to draft organizational regulations to be submitted to the Public Works Department for approval and implementation.

Cooperate to Stabilize Prices

Mr. Gerber, Deputy General Manager of the Public Works Department, told reporters from the Western press the other day that the Public Works Department has now established an international organization dedicated to investigating market prices and rice prices within the concessions. According to a notice from the Public Works Department, the organization will cooperate with the French Concession Price Stabilization Committee to suppress merchant speculation and profiteering. Mr. Petersen of the Health Department is in charge.

Additional Staff Begin Work

However, whether the results of the organization's price investigations will be used as a standard for price control has not yet been decided. Its responsibility is to clearly investigate the current price situation and create a clear chart as a reference for the Public Works Department to stabilize prices. The organization also has one Japanese staff member responsible for negotiating with the Japanese side on food imports and one Chinese staff member responsible for negotiating with the Chinese side on such issues. The new agency has now begun operations in the Public Works Department building.

French Price Stabilization Committee Inspects Rice Warehouses

On the 19th of this month, the French Concession Price Stabilization Committee and the French Police sent representatives to inspect several rice shops and rice warehouses in the French Concession. The representatives examined documents related to the cost and purchase value of rice and focused particularly on speculation. If the selling price of rice was inconsistent with the cost and purchase value, an investigation was immediately conducted. Currently, a rice subcommittee is seeking ways to improve the rice market.

Blame Deng Che for Soaring Rice Prices

According to financial sources, 8,000 tons of foreign rice were ordered last week, and approximately 20,000 tons (10 quintals per ton) were purchased in June. The total amount of foreign rice imported from January to May was 1,674,610 quintals. Rice sources have been abundant. Even if temporary transportation difficulties arise, they should not affect market prices. Furthermore, supplies from Thailand and Burma are smooth, and foreign exchange has been relaxed. Inland japonica rice has also been transported, so there is no reason for prices to soar. It is hoped that the authorities will thoroughly investigate the continuous rise in rice prices in recent days to maintain the people's food supply.

### Refugee Area Will Remain Unchanged

This newspaper has repeatedly reported in detail on the Nan Shi refugee area and the plan to disband the refugees by the end of the month. It is now known that the measures for disbanding the refugees, in addition to issuing half a month's worth of food rations as reported in yesterday's newspaper,

Additional Relief Grain

Will be for twenty days, slightly different from what was reported. According to Mr. Xie Shibo, French Deputy Consul, Mr. Tang Na, Director of the Public Works Department, and Mr. Fan'erdi, three persons in charge of the refugee area's aftermath committee, spoke to a visiting reporter from the News Agency yesterday. The aforementioned food rations, totaling thirty-five days, are a proposal from the General Affairs Office, and the Aftermath Committee is still

Under Discussion

It has not yet been officially approved and announced. The supply of food to all refugees will continue until the end of this month. Once the Aftermath Committee approves the amount of relief grain to be distributed to each refugee, the General Affairs Office will be notified to proceed accordingly. The future of the refugee area is of great concern to all sectors. According to inquiries, although the refugees housed in the area will be quickly disbanded, the status of the refugee area will not be changed. Father Jacquinot established the area as a safe zone. The name "refugee area" is merely a customary term used by the people of Shanghai. At the time, both China and Japan agreed. Therefore, the future status of the area will not be changed.

### Unprecedented Surge in Rice Prices, Treacherous Merchants Manipulate, Public Security Prospects Worrying, Price Stabilization Committee to Discuss Price Stabilization Today

The entire food supply in Shanghai is being manipulated and monopolized by speculators, causing japonica and indica rice prices to rise sharply in recent days. The highest price has broken the new record of seventy-four yuan. Small citizens have suffered severely. The Public Works Department has decided to select staff to work with the French Concession Price Control Committee to handle the matter in order to crack down on illegal profiteering in rice. It is now learned that the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association has scheduled a joint meeting of the interim executive and supervisory committees for 3:00 p.m. today as a precautionary measure. At that time, the entire food issue will be addressed in detail to stabilize prices and suppress illegal transactions.

Price Stabilization Committee to Meet Today

The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has repeatedly handled the stabilization of tribute rice, with remarkable results, greatly benefiting the common people. In view of the continuous rise in rice prices in recent days, which not only affects the overall security within the concession, but also makes it impossible for ordinary citizens to make a living, forcing them to take risks. However, due to financial constraints, it is impossible to continue the main undertaking. In order to expand operations and discuss solutions, it has been decided to hold a full committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. today at the Shipping Club, 93 Guangdong Road. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate funds to ensure that the stabilization of tribute rice can be implemented as soon as possible.

Unprecedentedly High Prices, Early Market Closure

Yesterday morning, the rice shop tea market opened as usual at 7:30 a.m. A group of rice speculators, citing Hong Kong's ban on rice exports and the impending interruption of foreign rice supplies, were unwilling to easily sell their inventories and were determined to spread rumors. As a result, japonica and indica rice prices soared to unprecedented levels, rising by as much as five or six yuan compared to the previous market. In addition to closely monitoring market conditions, the Market Management Committee immediately sent personnel to monitor buying and selling by colleagues in the market and to prevent illegal transactions. However, it was difficult to stabilize public sentiment for a while, and the market had to be closed early.

No Fear of Interruption of Foreign Rice Supply

A reporter from New Voice News learned from relevant sources yesterday that Hong Kong's ban on rice exports only applies to a portion of the trade. Licensed rice merchants can still export rice. According to rumors, Shanghai's sea defense navigation has been restored, so there is no fear of interruption of foreign rice supplies. Furthermore, the rice inventories in Shanghai's warehouses are also very substantial. The market transactions of various goods on a daily basis have no obvious connection with daily international market prices. Yesterday morning's surge in rice prices was clearly caused by rice speculators. According to rice industry sources, even if the sea defense is officially sealed off, sources from [illegible] and other places can still [illegible] offset the effects, only slightly extending the time required [illegible].

French Public Works Department Inspects Rice Warehouses

It is learned that the French Concession Public Works Department's Price Stabilization Committee and the French Police dispatched representatives to several rice shops and rice warehouses within the concession the day before yesterday to prevent rice shops from raising rice prices without authorization. The representatives examined documents related to the cost and purchase value of rice and paid particular attention to speculation. Whenever the selling price of rice was inconsistent with the cost and purchase value, an inspection was immediately conducted. Currently, a rice subcommittee is seeking ways to improve the rice market.

### Tongfeng Bank Organizes Shangyu Disaster Relief Association

Tongfeng Bank on Tianjin Road in this city was founded by Zhang Quankang and others from Shangyu County, Shaoxing, and is particularly enthusiastic in supporting charitable causes. It is now learned that Zhang Quankang, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the bank, considering the severe famine in his hometown, with people starving in the wild and infants being abandoned, is particularly pitiful. He has specially joined with enthusiastic fellow villagers to initiate the organization of the Shangyu Disaster Relief Association. It is hoped that those from Shangyu residing in Shanghai will generously donate funds.

### Erratum

In the news item "British, Italian and German Merchants in Shanghai Mutually Prohibit Commercial Exchanges" published in this newspaper on June 15, "Tianxiang Foreign Firm" was a mistake for "Tianli Foreign Firm." This is hereby corrected.

### British Residents' Association Holds General Meeting, Actively Urging British Residents to Serve Their Motherland, French Children Sell Old Newspapers to Donate Money

On Tuesday of this week, the British Residents' Association held a general meeting. All members attended and enthusiastically discussed various issues concerning wartime measures and resolved to do their utmost to cooperate with the recently established Wartime Thrift Association to serve the country. The Association also hopes to cooperate with the British Council to raise donations from British residents in China and will soon publish a statement to actively awaken overseas residents to do their utmost for their motherland. In addition, it was decided to organize a special group to study various wartime measures and to encourage members to work hard to expand the scope and increase the number of people in the group in order to generate significant results. Finally, it was decided to establish a wartime committee and nominate Mr. Haynes Wilson, Jones Dunn, Parass, Arnold, and Mrs. Jones as members.

French Residents Mourn Fallen Soldiers

Today (Friday), French residents in this city will hold a memorial service for fallen soldiers at the Luban Road Church. In addition, French children in this city, considering the high price of old newspapers in Shanghai, collect old newspapers and sell them, donating the proceeds to their motherland. In January, they only obtained 14 yuan and 71 cents. In February, this increased to 100 yuan. In March, it increased to 180 yuan. In April, it was 400 yuan. In May, it was 982 yuan. To date, a total of 9,056 catties of old paper have been collected, worth 1,727 yuan and 51 cents. Recently, a Westerner came to Shanghai and described the economic situation in Germany, stating that the majority of skilled workers at the German Siemens-Halske electrical manufacturing plant are less than half of what they were before the war. Therefore, the production of various manufactures has also [illegible] decreased. In order to attract workers, the Junkers aircraft factory only requires twelve weeks of training in various trades before workers can enter the factory to work. Heavy industry also employs a large number of women. Recently, shipbuilding factories have advertised to recruit female workers. Another proof of the shortage of workers is that people who were previously considered unsuitable for work are now serving in various industries. There is an organization called the "Labor Front" in the country, which no citizen can oppose, but since 1934, work has gradually shown signs of fatigue. The Ruhr armaments factory previously needed 2,000 workers, but now it needs to hire 3,000 to maintain its original production. Although working hours have increased to 60 hours per week, authoritative estimates suggest that in the summer, women in the fields work 16 to 17 hours a day, accounting for 70 percent. As for German currency, in 1933, the average amount of paper money and currency circulating in the country was 80 marks per person. In May 1939, the amount of paper money issued was 11.5 billion marks. In just one month, it increased to 16 billion marks.

### Tram Increases Burden on Passengers, Why Not Crack Down on "Grease," Draining the Blood and Sweat of Many Taxpayers, Why is the Authorities So Generous to Public Utilities?

The Chinese-language edition of the North China Daily News yesterday carried a letter from a reader stating that with the value of legal tender having risen sharply, the Shanghai Tram Company announced that it would increase fares again from the 17th of this month. This is the second time the company has "revised" its fares in less than six months. The fare from Hartung Road to Henan Road, formerly eight cents, is now twelve cents.

An Increase of Fifteen, the high percentage increase, is the same as the repeated "revisions" of prices charged by other public utilities in the city, coupled with the hoarding and price gouging by unscrupulous merchants, has drained the blood and sweat of many taxpayers. Whenever any public utility company decides to request

An increase in charges, the authorities invariably allow it. This seems inconsistent with the Public Works Department's recent policy of cracking down on hoarding and profiteering. Tram ticket sellers are notorious for "greasing" their palms. This [illegible] habit is a disgrace to the tram company's management. The company must suffer considerable losses every year as a result of this, but has not taken effective action to eliminate it. Therefore, whatever excuse the tram company's management uses to increase fares again, it should first put an end to the "greasing" of its ticket sellers' palms.

### Xu Chengxu's Coffin Ceremony Yesterday

Mr. Xu Chengxu, a reporter for this newspaper, passed away at his residence the day before yesterday due to illness. Heaven has taken away a talented young man, and his ambition has died with him. Friends and colleagues are deeply shocked and saddened by the news. Mr. Xu's remains were placed in a coffin yesterday. The details are as follows:

Extreme Mourning Yesterday, in the morning and afternoon, Mr. Xu's friends, acquaintances, and colleagues visited the Hai Funeral Parlor to pay their respects, numbering several hundred people. Wreaths and elegiac couplets were sent from all sides, covering the surroundings, in extreme mourning. Mr. Xu's remains were placed in a coffin at 4:00 p.m. His wife and two sons cried loudly, the scene was extremely desolate. The coffin was then moved to the Yangzhou Guild Hall on Daxilu Dunxinlu.

Filial Piety Xu Chengxu was naturally filial. Several years ago, his elderly mother was very ill. In addition to hiring doctors to treat her, Xu saw that his mother's condition was worsening. He often personally served her medicine, unable to sleep at night, and once secretly cut flesh from his thigh to treat her. Fortunately, his mother's condition turned from danger to safety, and he was relieved. His filial piety is particularly admirable and worthy of emulation in these declining times.

### Being Sued for Unpaid Tuition Fees, A Strange Phenomenon in Education

Liu Shusheng, a native of Ningbo living at No. 267, Jinyu Lane, Mintini Road, is currently a medicine peddler. He has two daughters, the eldest named Fengying (15 years old) and the younger named Yunying (12 years old), both studying at Zhendong Elementary School at the intersection of Glock Road and Pi Shao Nai Road. Fengying is a fifth-grade student and Yunying is a third-grade student. Both students are extremely intelligent and always rank first in examinations. However, due to the impact of the war, Liu's circumstances are extremely miserable, resulting in both students' tuition fees for this semester, totaling 21 yuan, being unpaid. He repeatedly wrote to the school requesting an extension. As a result, the school did not understand, and the principal, Fan Shenxiong from Wuxi, provided a guarantee to the Second Special Court requesting a provisional attachment, and Liu's household furniture was sealed.

### Gun Murder of Wu Qilun, Suspects Retract Previous Confessions, Shooting and Killing After Robbery Attempt Fails, Adjourned for Further Hearing on the 29th

Gu Zhuxuan and his apprentices Qiao Yaoshan and Zheng Changchun, etc., were accused by Xia Guifu and others, the murderers of lawyer Wu Qilun, of being the instigators and were arrested by the Central Police Station on charges of instigating murder. The case has been repeatedly investigated and tried by Judge Feng Shide of the First Special Court. The murderers firmly stated that Gu, Qiao, and Zheng resented Wu Qilun for damaging their reputation and offered a reward of 2,000 yuan to have Wu killed. The public sentiment has been reported in the news. The case was heard again by Judge Feng in a special court at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Unexpectedly, the defendants Xia Guifu, Wei Shoulin, Wang Xingfang, and Xia Shoufeng completely retracted their

Confessions

Stating that they had originally formed a gang and carried weapons to rob lawyer Wu Qilun of the diamond ring on his hand. Because he (Wu Qilun) refused to hand it over and instead locked them in the room, preparing to report them to the police, they were anxious and ordered Xia Guifu to shoot him to death. Judge Feng checked the confession and sternly questioned the main culprit Xia Guifu: "You have been repeatedly questioned in this court, and you have been repeatedly advised in advance that this is a murder case, not child's play. You yourselves have violated the criminal law and should be punished by the national law. You must not falsely accuse others out of spite. You firmly stated that Wu Qilun was Gu Zhuxuan's enemy and that Gu paid 2,000 yuan in reward to his apprentices Qiao and Zheng to find you to kill Wu and vent his anger. Why are you suddenly completely retracting your confessions today?" Defendant Xia confessed:

Requesting the Presiding Judge's Forgiveness

"We were initially imprisoned in the police station, and because of all kinds of unspeakable pain, we had to lie. Now we are detained in prison, and we are very free and have no pain at all. Since there is no physical pain, why should we harm others?" The court checked the confession and questioned the defendant Zheng Changchun, who remained silent. Zheng's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, immediately stood up and requested that Zheng be transferred to the Western Prison. Judge Feng checked the circumstances and ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing to the 29th of this month.

His travel expenses are now almost exhausted. Because the weather has been hot recently, in order to save money, he changed to camping out in the alleyway the night before yesterday. At about 5:00 a.m. yesterday, Jiang, wearing a gray cloth gown, was camping out at the entrance of Lane 785, Julada Road, when thugs cut his throat with a knife, causing him to bleed profusely and his life to be in danger. After being discovered, someone reported the incident to the police station, who sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. An investigation was launched to determine the cause of the attack.

Education News

### Ministry of Education Issues Order to All Provinces to Support Education for Muslims, Must Eliminate Prejudices and Provide Substantial Subsidies

(Guilin Airmail) The Guizhou Provincial Government received a telegram from the Ministry of Education, stating that according to Bai Chongxi, Chairman of the China Islamic National Salvation Association, in the past ten years or so, Muslims in various places have made efforts to either contribute public assets or private wealth to establish Muslim elementary schools as much as possible and strive to promote them in order to make them widespread. Due to limited financial resources, progress has been very slow. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, this association has undertaken the important mission entrusted by the central government to assist the government and lead Muslims across the country to participate in the national construction work. It is increasingly felt that developing Muslim education is the most urgent need at present. A plan for the development of Muslim education has been drafted and submitted to the ministry, which has been adopted separately, and it has been approved that the establishment of elementary schools should be prioritized. The provincial education departments should urge each county's mosques to establish elementary schools attached to them, and the necessary funding should be subsidized by compulsory education. However, officials in the provincial and county governments and education bureaus may have failed to understand the ministry's intention [illegible] and are bound by past Han-Muslim prejudices. When Muslim schools apply for subsidies in accordance with regulations, the ministry makes excuses to refuse them, and even imposes registration conditions, thereby suppressing them. Now that the Muslims across the country all know that the ministry is vigorously promoting Muslim education, if the stipulated subsidy measures cannot be implemented, it will be impossible to console the hopes of the Muslims across the country. If they are suppressed because the registration conditions are not fully met, it is tantamount to destroying the existing budding Muslim education. It is now proposed to request the issuance of an order to all provincial education departments to instruct the county governments and education bureaus to (1) comply with the regulations and provide actual subsidies to Muslim elementary schools; (2) grant special flexibility for the registration of Muslim elementary schools or temporarily postpone registration and refrain from suppressing them; and (3) local education officials must understand the meaning of sincere unity and eliminate Muslim prejudices, etc. Apart from the second item, which may be considered later regarding temporary postponement of registration and refraining from suppression, the rest are essential and should be approved for implementation. The provincial government received the telegram [illegible] and has already instructed its subordinates to comply.

### Taixian Raises 100,000 Yuan to Support Elementary School Teachers

(Taixian Dispatch) Since Mr. Han Wenqing took over as the director of the Taixian Education Bureau, he has spared no effort in planning educational administration and promoting educational undertakings. Recently, with the soaring prices and the increase in the cost of living, Mr. Han, feeling sorry for the low salaries and difficult lives of elementary school teachers, has made efforts to appeal for relief. He has gained the sympathy of Mr. Li Mingyang, Commander-in-Chief of the Guerrilla Forces in the Tri-Provincial Border Area, Mr. Qiu Liqi, Magistrate of Taixian County, and people from all walks of life. Last year, Mr. Li, Commander-in-Chief, donated 10,000 yuan on his own. Recently, Mr. Li and Mr. Qiu, the County Magistrate, launched a fundraising campaign of 100,000 yuan. Three million yuan had already been allocated before the end of the lunar calendar's Dragon Boat Festival.

### Grain Prices Are Truly Starving People: Rice Prices Rise by Six or Seven Yuan, Although There Was a Slight Reversal… Prices Still Rose by Four or Five Yuan. Maritime Transport Is Still Possible… Mostly Siamese Rice Is Being Shipped. At Yesterday's Prices… Three Sheng of Rice Would Cost Two Yuan

The laissez-faire attitude towards the rice market, without any regulation, has allowed a basic necessity for the public to become a tool for speculation. Yesterday's price surge broke all previous records, reaching unexpectedly high levels. Whether in the open or black market, prices soared by a massive six or seven yuan. All types of imported rice, except for broken rice and rice tea, have crossed the sixty-yuan mark. No. 1 aged Saigon reached sixty-six yuan, and it is rumored that the off-market prices for various thick and thin Japonica rice exceeded seventy yuan. Changbang special clear Japonica rice reached seventy-five yuan. This unfortunate situation is entirely due to speculative rice merchants using rumors of a naval blockade and Hong Kong's exit restrictions, moving in and out, trying to manipulate prices by first hoarding and then releasing, causing widespread panic in the market. Clients from inland Zhejiang, Shaoxing, and other regions, as well as rural customers, were caught off guard. They rushed to sell at the beginning of the day, frantically trying to get rid of their rice regardless of the price or quality, as if overjoyed to be rid of it. This created an opportunity for those with goods to quote exorbitant prices, shouting out prices of several yuan at a time. Speculators also used their manipulative tactics, blindly following the trend, leading to a continuous jump in prices. The chaos in the market was beyond description, and selling prices reached unprecedented highs. No. 1 aged Saigon reached sixty-six yuan, No. 2 sixty-three yuan seven jiao, sixty-three yuan five fen, Fire-milled sixty-four yuan five jiao, sixty-four yuan, No. 1 Siamese sixty-five yuan six yuan, No. 2 sixty-three yuan five fen, Xiaowen Bank sixty-two yuan five fen, Pudong Bank sixty-two yuan, Tokyo polished top sixty-two yuan, while mixed broken rice and rice glutinous rice rose together. High-quality broken rice started at fifty-five yuan and then fell to fifty-three yuan, glutinous rice fifty-eight yuan. At this point, general retail sales stopped, and floating hoards were also released at high prices, causing the market to suddenly turn downwards. The reaction at the time was strong, and prices plummeted by more than two yuan. Xiaojiao Silver Bank only quoted sixty yuan five jiao, Pudong Bank sixty yuan. Unexpectedly, the lower prices suddenly attracted buying from hoarding clients, and the situation quickly recovered, with prices rising by one yuan again. The result of the close was that Xiaojiao rose to sixty-one yuan five jiao, sixty-one yuan, a sharp increase of six yuan compared to the morning's opening price, and about four yuan higher than the afternoon's increase the day before. Shen Ji threw out 750 tons of No. 2 Saigon arriving today at a price of seventy-three yuan, causing a temporary decline. After several rises and falls in the afternoon and evening, No. 2 Saigon and Siamese rice closed at sixty-four yuan to sixty-three yuan two or three jiao, Xiaojiao from sixty-three yuan to sixty-two yuan four jiao, still a significant four or five yuan higher than the night before. Original packaged Xiaojiao rice was retrieved at sixty-four yuan, Saigon No. 1 at sixty-eight yuan. Morning opening six yuan to sixty-five yuan nine jiao five fen, afternoon opening 18 packaged sixty-seven yuan eight yuan, 26 packaged sixty-six yuan, each up four to five yuan, blockade interruption rumors have all been proven false. Saigon telegraphed in the evening that unloading was continuing as normal, but the number of ships had indeed decreased, but the source of Siamese rice had not been affected, and the Siamese rice stored in the city was not a small amount.

Another ten thousand six hundred and fifty bags of imported rice arrived yesterday, transported from Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson's Lishun wheel, docked at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession, and unloading began last night. It is said that three thousand bags will be shipped to Fujian today.

Japonica and glutinous domestic rice, in this environment, were also similarly stimulated. Rumors of off-market trading in Japonica rice also mutually influenced each other, causing abnormal surges. The situation was even more favorable for these goods than for others. Changbang special clear Japonica rice dropped from a high of seventy-five yuan to seventy-four yuan, Suzhou Kunshan Changzhou white Japonica rice seventy-three four yuan, next to Susu Re rice seventy yuan, Qing Si special thin rice seventy-two three yuan, Zhongguan seventy-one yuan, Nangang early and late rice seventy yuan sixty-nine yuan. Glutinous rice, due to its low price and good quality, was highly sought after. Jinyi special Yuan, the market has opened to the sixty-yuan mark, and even Chang Dan goods require fifty-eight nine yuan, Jiangbei Yuan about fifty-seven yuan. Statistics show that both Japonica and glutinous rice increased sharply by five or six yuan, and a total of one thousand three four hundred bags arrived at the port. Storefront sales of No. 1 Saigon were fifty-nine yuan. The high price of glutinous rice is partly due to the recent mixing of glutinous rice in imported rice. It is said that in a certain place in western Zhejiang, glutinous rice and Dongshuang rice were already being sold together.

### Flour and Rice Markets Follow Suit, Yesterday Holding Steady, Expecting Further Increases

The flour market remains quietly firm. The No. 2 flour mill's price is still thirteen yuan eight jiao. In order to maintain the business in this street, various factories are only limiting sales to small, retail quantities, unable to fully supply. The same is true for sales to northern and southern clients. Total market transactions amount to over ten thousand bags. It is said that the Nanyang group, seeing the sudden tension in Vietnam and fearing disruptions to Hong Kong shipping, dared not to take further action. However, yesterday's news of Hong Kong's ban on rice exports and the surge in rice prices added another layer of strength to flour prices. As a result, old Che stations and inland flour have been holding steady, expecting further increases. The market outlook is therefore likely to rise rather than fall. Five thousand bags of flour are scheduled for shipment to Fujian on the 20th, and another fifteen thousand bags on the 21st.

### Yarn and Cotton

### Yarn Market Plunges by Over One Hundred Yuan, Double Horse Reaches a New Low of Nine Hundred and Fifty Yuan

The yarn market is weakening, and the price decline is intensifying. This is because unrest in the South China Sea has disrupted shipping lines from Hong Kong to Haiphong, leading to a temporary halt in loading, causing concern among Guangbang merchants. No packages of cotton yarn have been processed, greatly impacting confidence. Generally, those with floating long positions are nervous and liquidate, so even though foreign exchange rates have fallen, there is no impact on the market. Yarn prices are therefore declining in a straight line. Twenty count Double Horse yarn has reached a new low of nine hundred and fifty yuan.

The yarn market opened this morning. Due to the report of a naval blockade of Haiphong, people panicked, and sellers were even more eager to sell. The price of twenty count Double Horse yarn was one thousand and fifty yuan, then rose to one thousand and sixty yuan. In an instant, sellers came one after another, and the market became smaller and smaller, breaking the one thousand yuan mark. The closing price was nine hundred and seventy-two yuan. It is estimated that a total of 1,730 bales were traded during the half-day. The price of twenty count Double Horse yarn fell by one hundred and thirty-five yuan. Four hundred and twenty pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today, two hundred and twenty-five pieces to Weihaiwei, and forty-five pieces to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each trade group is listed below:

Counterparts 1,460 Ningbo 270 Total 1,730

### If Yarn is Unstable, the Cotton Market is Even More Stagnant

Cotton trading has ceased because the yarn market is unstable and has plummeted. Twenty count Double Horse yarn has hit a new low for the last half year. As a result, factory demand is even clearer. As for those in the trade, everyone has plenty to eat and is unwilling to do business in the current environment, so the situation is effectively deadlocked.

Another report states that the price of imported cotton and fine yarn cotton rose at the start of the morning session due to speculative buying, then closed higher than the previous day by more than ten pounds due to Wall Street's purchasing. Indian lint is predicted to fall by five rupees.

Shanghai imported cotton trading, it is rumored that Jardine Matheson has ceased shipments to Haiphong, so yarn prices have plummeted, but exchange rates are tight, and raw cotton prices have increased in value. However, trading is very thin, becoming a dead market. Overseas cotton markets are rising, but they have failed to stimulate confidence.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Calm and Stable, Foreign Stocks Slightly Weakened

The securities gray market was very stable yesterday, but there were more declines than increases. The market lacked excitement and was not depressed. Since August 13th, most of the various public bonds held by Shanghai banks have been transported to the mainland for storage, so the number of securities in the market is limited, significantly reduced from before. The river surface is narrow, and the waves are naturally small. Furthermore, various rumors and dangers since the third year have been turned into safety, and they have safely passed through. Therefore, those who take long positions are bolder. However, with excessively high interest rates, even if the market price does not fall, those who take long positions lose a lot of money, and those who short sell use this to further put pressure on the market price. Now that the ninth installment of interest is about to expire, as long as there are no unexpected rumors, the market price should still rise, but the amount will definitely be limited. Yesterday, Jiufeng bought in throughout the day, while Datong sold out throughout the day. Numbers 4, 12, and 38 all sold out. Although Hongkang and Lianyi bought in, the market price still failed to increase. The result of the fluctuation was that, except for which has not been traded for four days, the rest fell by about a jiao, while improved by five fen. The total volume traded was about 600,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.

Stock trading: 12 shares of Zhejiang industry shares were traded at a price of 77 yuan five fen.

The stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce was slightly weakened yesterday, as many holders of floating long positions liquidated. There was not much change in prices. Jardine Matheson shares fell by two yuan compared to the opening price due to the decline in yarn prices. Rubber shares were still ignored, with only slight short covering activity.

London, 19th (Wednesday) report: Today's stock market for British Far East companies showed continued weakness in bank shares. Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China shares fell two shillings six pence to seven pounds seven shillings six pence, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation London registered shares fell four pounds to seventy pounds, Hong Kong registered shares fell three pounds to seventy-five pounds. The rest were unchanged.

### Profiteers Cash Out at High Prices: Gold Prices Fluctuate Wildly, Reaching a High of 5,900 Yuan Before Noon

Yesterday, the cash "Haxia" (arbitrage) market was a case of starting strong but ending weakly. High prices were unsustainable, leading to a gradual decline and a general lack of momentum. It was mainly due to a large number of people taking advantage of the high prices to sell short. Although intermediaries from various guilds tried to absorb the selling pressure, the sellers' power was overwhelming, and the supply of gold was quite ample. Furthermore, negative news spread in the afternoon, weakening market sentiment. Initially, the morning saw tight exchange rates, and Qian Dui Ye (money exchange shops) and banks aggressively buying, pushing the price to 5,900 yuan twice. Subsequently, a certain gold firm repeatedly sold short, and even long-term holders came out to sell, suppressing the price slightly. The noon closing was only 5,775 yuan. The situation was relatively stable in the early afternoon, but many large holders had not finished cashing out. Although a certain gold firm took the opportunity to profit by covering their short positions, they still felt apprehensive. The price once retreated to 5,650 yuan, but ultimately closed at 5,680 yuan, down 60 yuan from the previous day. The total trading volume for the day was over 4,000 taels. Jewelry gold in silver shops initially rose and then fell, ultimately declining slightly by ten yuan. Gold held by customs remained unchanged.

"Haxia" Falls Back 60 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially saw strong buying due to soft exchange rates, jumping 140 yuan. Qian Dui Ye bought 20 taels from a gold firm at 5,880 yuan. Subsequently, as Qian Dui Ye continued buying and banks also absorbed, the price rose another 20 yuan, with Qian Dui Ye buying 50 taels from a certain gold firm at 5,900 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm suddenly sold short heavily, putting pressure on the market with several hundred taels. Adding to the pressure, securities firms also sold, causing the price to fall back 70 yuan. Qian Dui Ye sold 20 taels to a bank at 5,830 yuan. Subsequently, as exchange rates remained tight, banks aggressively increased their long positions, and sellers temporarily decreased, causing another jump of 70 yuan, returning to the high price of 5,900 yuan. However, exchange rates suddenly strengthened, and gold firms resumed heavy selling, with cash firms also selling. General long holders, seeing the situation, followed suit. By noon, the price had fallen back to below 5,800 yuan. A bank sold 20 taels to a gold firm at 5,750 yuan. Before the close, a bank slightly bought, raising the price by 25 yuan, with the bank buying 30 taels from a securities firm at 5,775 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, Qian Dui Ye initially bought 30 taels from a bank at 5,780 yuan. Unexpectedly, sellers followed in quick succession, as the exchange rate softened. Banks successively cashed out their long positions, and cash firms and Qian Dui Ye also sold to each other. Although gold firms continuously covered their short positions in between, they still felt heavily positioned. Soon, the price plummeted 130 yuan, with a bank selling 10 taels to a gold firm at 5,650 yuan. After this, selling pressure eased slightly, and a certain bank resumed buying, causing a rise of 30 yuan, with banks trading 30 taels with each other at 5,680 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell back 60 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total fluctuation of 250 yuan. The selling price of cash firms' own-brand gold was 10 yuan higher than "Haxia," and the buying price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current marked gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. There was little activity in both.

Jewelry Gold Initially Rises, Then Falls Back

For jewelry gold in silver shops, the initial selling price of each tael at Da Tong Hang (a silver shop) was still listed at 590 yuan. At 9:40 am, it was raised by 20 yuan. At 10:20 am, it fell back 10 yuan. At 11:50 am, it fell back slightly by 10 yuan. At 3:00 pm, it was lowered by 10 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 10 yuan, with Da Tong Hang revising the price to 580 yuan. The new price at Xin Tong Hang (another silver shop) was the same as the above price. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Banks Closed Accounts Yesterday

Yesterday (the 20th) was the period for banks to settle interest for the first half of the year on current savings and current deposits. Internal procedures at various banks were quite busy. Staff at some banks with large numbers of savings and current account holders had to work until late at night to complete the process. Regarding the closure for account reconciliation, since Mr. Ying Yongyu submitted the matter to the Bankers' Association for discussion, colleagues at Gu Hang (a bank) responded enthusiastically, with over 1,800 people jointly signing letters to the Bankers' Association. The Bankers' Association was reportedly studying the matter after the Silver and Money Industry Amateur Association forwarded it with an official letter for discussion by the Association.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Japanese Merchants Search for Soybeans

The market for new broad beans was tight due to soaring rice prices and the presence of Japanese merchants searching for supplies. Yesterday, Jiading white-skinned broad beans opened at 20.07 to 20.05 yuan, with 1,340 bags traded. Wuhu small-grain white-skinned broad beans also reached 19 yuan, with 200 bags traded. Beigang green-skinned broad beans also traded at 20.05 to 20 yuan, with over 400 bags traded. The purchases were mainly made by Japanese merchants, with Xinghua local merchants assisting.

In addition, today there were 450 bags of soybeans, 570 tins of raw oil, and 7,000 soybean cakes, all transported to Hong Kong. Another batch of 1,000 soybean cakes was shipped to Fujian yesterday.

### North-South Goods: Premium Fungus Expensive

Premium fungus refers to the largest type of black fungus. As there have been no original shipments arriving, merchants are supplying the market with the top layers selected from Sichuan fungus. Therefore, the selling price is high, with the market price yesterday at 500 yuan, a difference of 200 yuan compared to mixed-grade fungus.

### Piece Goods: Floating Stocks Tend to Be Sold, No Futures Trading

Fabric Market: Due to the tense situation in Vietnam, Sichuan and Yunnan merchants have stopped procuring goods. Floating stocks tend to be sold, putting pressure on the market, which is trending downward. The price of some white goods has plummeted by 1 to 2 yuan per bolt, and dyed fabrics have fallen by more than 1 yuan. There is no futures trading. Local wholesale shops are handling over 5,000 bolts of grey cloth, bleached cloth, and blue cloth. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants are handling over 100 pieces of fine twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. Guangdong merchants are handling over 80 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, and colored cloth. Anhui merchants are handling several thousand bolts of poplin, fine cloth, and colored cloth.

Eastern cloth prices are experiencing panic among industry members and wild fluctuations. The opening price for Longtou fine cloth in the morning market was 30.05 yuan, and Four Gentlemen serge was 8.3 fen per yard. The selling pressure intensified in the afternoon market, and Longtou plummeted to 18.89 yuan. Subsequently, Tianjin merchants searched for supplies, causing a rebound to 29.5 yuan. However, compared to the previous day, it had fallen sharply by about 4 yuan per bolt. Most mid-grade fine cloth and fine twill were not traded, with a price drop of 1 to 2.5 yuan per bolt.

Piece goods exports on the 21st include 110 pieces shipped to Weihaiwei, 40 pieces shipped to Tianjin, and 285 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Coarse Refined White Slightly Rises

Yesterday's market trend was slightly tighter. The guild set the price for spot goods. The morning price for 24 coarse white sugar from the outer warehouses was 70.08 and 70.09 to 70.085 yuan. The afternoon price was 70.4 yuan, and re-export sugar was 56.3 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. Sugar for delivery on July 2nd was 56.8 yuan. Taikoo refined white B grade from Western warehouses (new goods) was 82.5 to 82 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. Dutch red sugar also rose by the same amount, to 59.7 yuan. For domestic sugar, Jian Bang (a sugar merchant) offered over 100 bags of Taikoo imported "Diao Qing," at 63.5 yuan.

### Coal: Coal Ball Factory Prices Continue to Rise, 8 Yuan Per Dan

The price of coal balls yesterday increased by 8 yuan due to rumors in the market related to coastal defense and concerns about the shortage of raw coal dust. The quoted price from the factory is 148 yuan per ton, plus transportation costs for delivery. Retail price at local stores is 8 yuan per dan.

### New Arrivals of Sea Products: Sea Cucumber Quickly Sold Out

Most Western sea cucumbers, such as bare sea cucumbers, are shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. However, the quality varies, resulting in price differences. It is reported that over 100 pieces of Red Sea goods arrived the day before yesterday, with excellent quality and already sold out. The prices are as follows: Premium bare sea cucumber 570 yuan, top-grade bare sea cucumber 520 yuan, large top-grade bare sea cucumber 485 yuan, upper large bare sea cucumber 440 yuan, large bare sea cucumber 396 yuan, large-medium bare sea cucumber 320 yuan, medium bare sea cucumber 295 yuan, small-medium bare sea cucumber 275 yuan, small bare sea cucumber 240 yuan, glossy top-grade bare sea cucumber 405 yuan, black bare sea cucumber 330 yuan.

Old News, Newly Copied: 67 Years Ago (421) (From the Shen Bao of the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Qing Dynasty)

### A Humorous Tale of Tooth Extraction

The British consul stationed in Cairo, Egypt, went to see the King of Egypt one day on business. The King was suffering from a toothache, his cheek swollen like a melon, his mouth full of medicated cotton, and he kept groaning. After offering his condolences, the consul said, "Why doesn't Your Majesty have the tooth extracted as a way to cut the weeds and eliminate the roots?" The King raised his head and asked, "Doesn't it hurt?" The consul said, "The doctor uses anesthesia first, so although it hurts during the extraction, you won't feel anything." The King hesitated for a moment, then summoned a dentist. After some conversation to build courage, the King suddenly showed a look of fear! He said, "You say that tooth extraction doesn't hurt, but there is something suspicious. You must first have someone else try it before it can be done." He then summoned a soldier, rewarded him with silver, and explained the situation. The soldier agreed, and the King carefully observed, ordering the dentist to extract the tooth in the soldier's mouth that was causing the same pain as the King's. The dentist restrained the soldier in a chair, and the King stood beside him watching. He saw the doctor apply the anesthesia and extract the large tooth with pliers, without the soldier feeling anything. The King was overjoyed and said, "Wonderful, wonderful!" He ordered his attendants to reward the soldier with wine and dismiss him. Then he sat in the chair to have his tooth extracted. Just as the doctor was about to apply the anesthesia, the King suddenly became greatly alarmed, his face pale, and he jumped up, repeatedly saying, "Not good! Not good! The soldier is young and strong, but I am old and weak, and I fear I cannot bear it." He then summoned a weak woman from the palace to try the extraction. Indeed, she also suffered no pain. Only then did the King dare to sit down again and order his tooth to be extracted.

### Rumor

—The Front Car

How do rumors arise? First, a rumor originates with a purpose, whether to benefit oneself or harm others. However, to be effective, in addition to creating the rumor, one must first understand the target, attacking their weaknesses so that the rumor can gain traction. For example, when a child cries, the mother shouts that a tiger is coming. The reason the mother doesn't shout "Little Meow" but "tiger" is because the child fears tigers. The child's fear of tigers is their weakness. But this weakness is not enough, because even though the mother shouts "tiger," it is still Little Meow that comes. However, the rumor of the tiger can ultimately deceive the child because the child "trusts" the rumor too easily. He hears "tiger" but doesn't see Little Meow tangled at his feet. Thus, rumors arise continuously, and those who create them succeed continuously.

So, how do we attack rumors? We often use "facts to prove it." But if it's a rumor, why "wait" for facts to prove it? Before the facts prove it, the rumor-monger has already gained benefits in that instant. The constant changes in the speculative market use constant "rumors" to make the "facts" unable to keep up.

Therefore, when a rumor comes before you, you should use sharp eyes, rational judgment, and agile action to extinguish it. For example, if someone suddenly shouts that the neighbor's house is on fire, first identify who is shouting "fire," lest it be a street urchin. What is the neighbor's building made of? There is a big difference between steel-reinforced concrete and a thatched shed. Then immediately jump onto the drying platform to see if it's the left or right neighbor. Wind direction and fire are also related. In this way, if there really is a fire, it's not too late to pack up your valuables. Otherwise, wouldn't it be laughable to cry and shout, panic and rush, grab a pillow and run into the street, only to be laughed at by the street urchins?

### "Only Death, No Life"—Excerpts from a Money-Grubber's Warning to the World

—Blind Doctor

Since the opening of the so-called "clubs" and "gardens" of the "Bad Earth," the local news columns of various newspapers have frequently added cases of encroachment, running away, and suicide. Even the various supplements often contain texts such as "Confessions of a Gambler" and "The Dying Wails of a Gambler." In theory, seeing so many alarming words in the newspapers should reduce the number of gamblers, and there should be no more unfortunate incidents caused by gambling. However, sadly, there are still so many gamblers. Recently, my old friend, Xin Jun, almost destroyed everything because of this. Fortunately, he woke up early. Although he lost 2,700 yuan, it did not lead to other misfortunes. However, after this setback, he was determined to have me write out the "motives" that cause people to fall into gambling dens as a warning to future generations!

He said: Gamblers are not unaware that gambling dens are devil dens, but the reasons why people often go to their doom are: (1) Curiosity: wanting to see what it's like. (2) Poverty: wanting to skim some cream. (3) Unwise friendships: becoming assimilated over time. (4) A lack of frugality: being unable to make up for a deficit and resorting to a desperate gamble. To avoid such misfortune, one must practice being uninterested, not greedy for small gains, choosing friends carefully, and being frugal. In short, no matter how beautiful their facilities are, how comfortable their services are, and how attentive their attendants are, you should never even think about it, let alone want to eat their free food. To put it more bluntly, how can they "stand" such large expenses if they don't rely on gamblers to send them money? One more thing: even if you don't want to eat free food and don't want to win money, but just want to occasionally play and visit, that is also very dangerous! Because once you get inside, it's really strange: your original idea disappears. I myself am one who fell into the gambling den because of a visit.

In addition, you must keep your eyes open when making friends. Gambling friends must never be made. If an old friend already has a gambling habit, you must not be emotionally moved beyond offering friendly advice. Once you are emotionally moved, you will naturally follow in their footsteps.

Frugality is the fortress for our life. If you save and are frugal, and don't waste, then even if you don't "have surplus," you can at least have no worries about food and clothing. If you have no worries about food and clothing, then all adventurous and opportunistic thoughts will not arise. I have seen many friends who committed suicide because of gambling. In addition to the reasons mentioned above for falling into the trap of gambling, they often indulged in gluttony, licentiousness, and roaming, which led to their spending more than they earned, accumulating debt that could not be repaid, and then resorting to gambling, "joining clubs," and entering "gardens" in hopes of a lucky success. As a result, the god of wealth (?) did not help you, the debt increased even more, and you had no face to meet people, so you had to take your own life.

Even ants cherish their lives. Why should we commit suicide for gambling?! So, I want to advise those who don't gamble to always stand firm and adhere to the four points above to avoid repeating the mistakes of those who came before. Those who have gambled, even if they have lost a lot of money, it is like having a serious illness. Don't think about trying to win back the money, because if you don't think about winning it back, then even after a serious illness, although your vital energy is severely damaged, you can still gradually recover. If you are obsessed with "returning the basin" and sink further, I can say with certainty: "Only death, no life."

Hawthorne's Case

### The Dancer's Destination

—By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two: "A Page of History!"

As he spoke, his eyes looked at the cheap cigarette holder on the desk. "My bedroom is on the third floor, right next to Jinmei's room. I fell asleep soon after I got into bed and didn't wake up until I was startled by the gunshot. Only then did I realize it was past midnight."

"How did you know the time?"

"When I heard the gunshot, I was still groggy and thought it was the bursting of a rickshaw tire, because I had heard it several times before. But soon after, Jinmei came and knocked on my door anxiously. I got up and looked at the small clock on the dressing table. It was already 12:20. I followed her downstairs, and as soon as I walked in, I saw Lilan in that state. It almost scared me to death!" As he said this, his voice trembled slightly, and a look of surprise leaked out of his bright black eyes.

Hawthorne asked, "Do you know what time your niece came home last night?"

The old man shook his head. "I don't know. She always comes home late at night, sometimes not even coming home at all."

"Did you know the time she came back in the past?"

"Not really. Sometimes I would be awake and hear her open the door and come in. If I was sound asleep, then I wouldn't hear it. As I said, I live on the third floor."

Hawthorne nodded and asked, "Then, besides you, do the two servants know what time she came back last night?"

Li Zhifan hesitated for a moment and replied, "I don't know either. I haven't asked them. But according to Jinmei, she didn't hear Lilan come back either. When we went downstairs, the front door wasn't locked."

Ni Jinshou suddenly interjected, "I think the old gatekeeper always knows. Should we call him in right away!"

Hawthorne shook his head. "Wait a minute, I have a few more questions to ask Mr. Ji." He took out a cigarette case, offered one to the old man, and lit one himself. "Mr. Li, for the sake of finding out the truth of this case, we can't help but pay attention to all aspects. Now, there is something about your niece's private life that I hope you can answer truthfully." (21)

### Mailing a Letter

—Gong Guangzhao

I went to the post office to buy stamps to mail a pair of airmail letters. As soon as I got to the post office, I saw that there were a lot of people buying stamps. I thought I would wait until there were fewer people buying stamps before I went to buy them. I leaned against the registered mail counter and watched them send letters. Suddenly, someone patted me on the back. "Sir, are you mailing airmail letters?" He had obviously seen me holding the letters with the airmail stickers on them. I nodded. "Sir, it's so annoying that you can't return the stamps you bought! I originally bought two 3-cent stamps to mail airmail letters, one to Tianjin and one to Hong Kong," the man said incessantly. "There are no airmail routes to Hong Kong," I told him. "Yes, that's why. Now I don't need the 3-cent stamps, and I can't return them. Sir, you're mailing airmail letters, please help me use them." He looked at me pleadingly. I felt very sorry for him and agreed to his request. But when I was about to smear the glue and stick the stamps on the letters, a big secret was revealed to me when I turned the stamps over. On the back of the stamp was a red stain of water, and on the front, there was a subtle black shadow. Two obvious pieces of evidence revealed to me that it was a used stamp. The man, on the other hand, had already run away. I resigned myself to bad luck and bought another stamp. In haste and taking advantage of other people's sympathy, this kind of fraud may be staged every day, so I recorded it to warn those who come after.

Entertainment Circle

### What I Saw in "Gone With the Wind"

—Wei Jun

We know that the movie "Gone With the Wind" is based on the novel "Gone With the Wind." This novel is the famous work of female writer Margaret Mitchell, selling 2 million copies and translated into 16 languages. Because this novel uses the American Civil War as the longitude and the love of sons and daughters as the latitude, Americans especially love to read it. It sold 1.75 million copies in the United States alone. Once it was made into a movie, and it was a long film faithful to the original book, the people of the movie kingdom naturally went crazy.

Since "Gone With the Wind" is a literary film faithful to the original book, we must first have an understanding of the original book before watching the film, or else we will be just following the crowd and the excitement, and we will inevitably miss out on the highlights of the film. If you don't have time to read the original book of 1,037 pages, the minimum you should do is read the story of "Gone With the Wind."

This film is more delicate than great. It vividly depicts the moods of a stubborn and selfish girl, and has the same ingenuity as "Dream of the Red Chamber." There are three points that I see as worth mentioning.

The Excellence of Technique

There are many new techniques used in this film. Several reflective shots have reached the realm of transformation in terms of photographic art. The color is also an excellent achievement, bright but not vulgar, quiet but not obscure, soft but not glaring. These are all things that have not been seen in color films before "Gone With the Wind." The director's technique is also commendable. For example, in the scene where the black slave catches chickens, the black slave greedily grabs the chicken with a bright red comb. The brilliance of the color and the coldness of the interspersion are truly amazing. Another example is the scene where Scarlett kills the straggler. When the gunshot rings out, the straggler's face is covered with blood as he rolls down the stairs. The realism of the scene is heart-stopping.

The Exquisite Acting

Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, and others are all veterans who have enjoyed fame for a long time, and their acting skills are of course beyond doubt. It's just that Vivien Leigh, who plays Scarlett, has also been on the screen, but has always been unknown. This time, in "Gone With the Wind," she is the most important and hardest worker from beginning to end. Her expressions, shrewishness, resentment, and perseverance bring out the feelings of a tragic woman from ancient times, which cannot be said to be her great success.

The Grandeur of the Sets

The imitation of ancient architecture in Atlanta City, the specially built streets, the towering fire, and the groaning wounded soldiers are scenes that move the audience to almost merge with the screen. Other scenes, clothes, and objects are all true to the era and faithful to the original book. This meticulous attitude, although said to be a consistent style of Hollywood, also requires their strong financial resources and willingness to spend money.

### The Future Trend of the Rising Dramatic Arts Society

— Shen Qi

The Trend of Spoken Drama is Advancing

In Shanghai, the audience for spoken drama may not seem extensive, but in terms of intellectual enlightenment and emotional grasp, spoken drama is superior to general Peking opera and movies. Recently, the atmosphere of resisting and building the nation has surged, while Peking opera remains stagnant, and movies are stuck in the rut of filming simple folk stories. Consequently, progressive audiences are turning to spoken drama. The popularity of both professional and amateur theater groups is proof of this. Among the professional theater groups, currently, there are only the China Traveling Theater Troupe and the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Society. Not long ago, they were both wavering due to location issues. However, China Traveling Theater Troupe has now renewed its contract for another six months, and the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Society has also decided on its future direction.

The Dramatic Arts Society Decides to Renew the Contract

The Dramatic Arts Society was originally a transformation of the Qingdao Dramatic Arts Society. Later, with the sponsorship of the Sino-French Friendship Association, it changed its name to its current one. Its first performance at the Swatow Theater, the play "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," established its high status today. After the five-month lease at Swatow Theater expired, it moved to the Lafayette Theater. The plays "Motherland," "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom," and "Liang Hongyu" all received praise from public opinion. Their lease with Lafayette Theater is set to expire on the twenty-third of this month, marking the end of their second phase. Originally, the third phase plan was to lead the entire society on a tour to the South Seas Islands. However, due to the European situation, the previous plan was canceled, and it was decided to renew the contract with Lafayette Theater for another six months, starting from the twenty-eighth of this month. However, unlike before, where revenue was split between the front and backstage, the Dramatic Arts Society will now be solely responsible, paying a fixed daily rent to the theater owner.

Changing One Play Per Week

Regarding their third phase plan, in addition to the entire society working together to intensify their core work, they will also train new members to strengthen their lineup. At the same time, there will be changes in the plays performed. They will take a four-day break starting on the twenty-fourth and resume on the twenty-eighth. Afterwards, they will change the play every week. Among the decided plays, the first week will feature "This is Only Spring," starring Xia Xiabai, Li Xuli, and the second week will feature "The Young Mistress's Fan," starring Lu Luming.

### New Lineups in Two Theatrical Circles

— Wei Wo

The Gold and Renewal Theaters have both specially invited famous northern opera stars to perform in Shanghai at the beginning of next month. The new star at the Gold Theater is female performer Mao Shilai, and at the Renewal Theater is male performer Tan Fuying. It is said that many famous actors are coming with them this time. The reporter has obtained the details of the lineups from the two theaters, and a comprehensive announcement is made below:

Mao Shilai's Team

Mao Shilai's team is currently performing at the Guanglu Theater in Qingdao. After the performances, they will come to Shanghai and debut at the Gold Theater around the beginning of next month. The lineup is as follows:

Lead Actor: Mao Shilai

Male Role: Chen Shaolin

Young Male Role: Chen Shengtai

Clown: Ai Shiju, Zhan Shifu, Luo Shengong

Painted Face: Yuan Shihai, Xu Shengkui

Old Male Role with Wrapped Head: Xu Xixing

Martial Male Role: Zhang Yunxi

Martial Female Role: Wang Shixiang

Martial Arts: Zhang Shaojie

The above lineup is slightly different from Shilai's previous visit to Shanghai. The male role Sha Shixin has been replaced by Chen Shaolin. (Originally, the young male role accompanying Mao to Shanghai this time was supposed to be Chi Shigong. Shigong declined the invitation from the Gold Theater because he had not graduated for long and because of Sha Shixin's previous disappointment in coming south rashly, so Shaolin was invited instead). The young male role Jiang Shiyu has also been replaced by Chen Shengtai. (It is said that this is because Shiyu's asking price was too high). Shengtai came with Xi Xiaobo this spring and received favorable reviews. He is also a graduate of Fu Liancheng, and it is expected that he will be able to cooperate happily with Shilai. The clowns Ai Shiju and Luo Shengong are both veterans from the previous team. This time, Zhan Shifu has been added, making it even better. According to reports, Shifu's clown skills were extremely popular during his time at the academy, far above Shiju's. He was Shilai's old partner during Shilai's academy days. Shifu accompanied Shilai when he first came south, but Shilai then invited Shiju to partner with him because Shifu's voice had deteriorated. This time, he is working with Shilai again, which is good news for the audience. Yuan Shihai is slated for the painted face role. However, because Shihai is currently performing with Lian Liang in Shanghai, it is still a question of whether Lian Liang will be willing to let Shihai stay in Shanghai, as the French Customs is currently very focused on painted face roles. Chen Xixing, the old male role with a wrapped head, is the senior student of Fu Liancheng and has worked with Mao Shilai's partner Gou Huisheng for a long time. He is also an expert in this field. Regarding the martial male role, the Gold Theater is in contact with Zhang Yunxi. However, Yunxi is currently performing in the Northeast and is extremely popular. It is currently difficult to determine whether he can arrive in time. If Yunxi comes, then the martial female role Wang Shixiang and Yunxi's assistant Zhang Shaojie will also come. Otherwise, the Gold Theater plans to have Wu Yanheng continue for another term.

### Liang Xiaoluan Enters and Pays Respects to Mei Lanfang

— Gu

Female performer Liang Xiaoluan has given a very good impression to the opera lovers during her performance at the Renewal Theater this time. Starting today, she began to post farewell souvenirs. Yesterday, the reporter met Liang Qi (also known as Xiaoluan) at the China Hotel and asked her what new developments she planned after her performance at the Renewal Theater ended. She smiled and replied to the reporter:

"Although I feel that my performance in Shanghai has been satisfactory, I feel that my art is very lacking. Therefore, after leaving the Renewal Theater, I don't want to seek any new developments, but want to study hard and learn from a teacher."

She then said: "Recently, a Mrs. Shen told me that she intended to introduce me to Dr. Mei Lanfang, a master of the arts. If there are no unexpected obstacles, I will go to Hong Kong to pay respects to Dr. Mei after resting in Shanghai for a few days."

It is said that this Mrs. Shen said that she had a 120% certainty of introducing her. We only hope that there are no unexpected obstacles, so that after "Little Bird" Wang Xichun, Dr. Mei will have another outstanding disciple.

### Recent Records of the Film Industry

— Zheng Baiyong

Recently, it has been rumored that Xinhua will produce a large number of "folk tale" films, and at the same time start filming "Pearl Tower", "Describing Golden Phoenix", and "Jade Dragonfly". It is heard that there are some discrepancies. The above films are not Xinhua's plans, but the planned debut productions of a certain film company that is still being organized. The company is under the jurisdiction of the China United Film Company, so the registration procedures for the company have not yet been completed, and it may be temporarily commissioned by Xinhua to produce them.

The company, with a large amount of capital, relies on the technical personnel of Xinhua, Huaxin, and Huacheng, and a wide photography factory, preparing to produce eight or nine outstanding productions in the most agile way, such as "Wang Laohu Robbing His Bride" directed by Xu Xinwei and starring Shangguan Yunzhu, Gu Yelu, Jiang Ming, and Han Langen; "Describing Golden Phoenix" directed by Tang Jie and starring Li Hong and Zhang Wan; "Jasper Basket" directed by Bu Wancang and starring Chen Yanyan, Li Qing, and Gu Yelu, etc.

"Du Shiniang" is also one of the nine masterpieces planned by the company. It is now heard that there are rumors of transferring the production to Guohua.

### Hollywood Actresses Compete to Insure Their Beauty and Health – Sonja Henie's Pair of Skating Legs are Insured for 2.6 Million Yuan

The June 18th Xinwen Bao Yihai published a very interesting news item, saying that Hollywood movie stars are willing to spend huge sums of money on insurance to protect their health and beauty in order to prevent accidents, because the health and beauty of their bodies are very closely related to their reputation. For example, the toe dancer Zolena in "Toes Up," her pair of jade toes, are insured for 250,000 yuan each. Actress Alice Faye's complexion is considered by color film experts to be the most suitable for filming color films without the need for powder, so her complexion is also insured for 25,000 yuan. Another actress, Annie Louise, her weight is the most moderate in Hollywood, so her "standard weight" is also insured for 75,000 yuan. Sonja Henie's total insurance coverage is 3 million yuan, of which 2.6 million yuan is for her two "skating legs". This shocking insurance fully proves how much the movie stars value and sell their health and beauty. Looking back at Chinese women, although the morbid beauty praised in ancient times, such as Xi Shi holding her heart and Daiyu's frailty, has been eliminated by the times and become a historical relic, there are still a few women who, although possessing innate beauty, often have flat chests and dull skin due to their weak bodies. Although they apply thick makeup and wear fine clothes, they cannot get rid of their sickly appearance. Seeing other people's towering breasts and high hips, looking up and striding forward, it is truly envious and ashamed.

The Minyi "Xin Bao Feng," produced by Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory, is the latest multiple hormone preparation specially created to suit the physique of Chinese women. It contains mammary gland hormone, which is the most potent chemical substance for promoting breast development, and is supplemented by Minyi's synthetic ovarian hormone and precious endocrine preparations such as Minyi "Placenta Zhen". It mainly treats sexual dysfunction, irregular menstruation, breast atrophy, dull skin, palpitations, insomnia, etc. It is remarkably effective and can transform leanness into health and beauty. The most obvious effect is that the flat breasts gradually become rounded. If you look in the mirror, you will definitely feel that you are no longer the same as before and smile with delight.

The general branches of Chinese and Western pharmacies in the city, the western medicine departments of Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, and New World department stores, Dashijie Pharmacy, Baxianqiao Guotai Xingji Pharmacy, French-Chinese Pharmacy, Huayang Pharmacy, Dalu Pharmacy, Nanyang Pharmacy, Zhengwei Pharmacy, Jicheng Pharmacy, Huaying Pharmacy, Huamei Pharmacy, British-Chinese Pharmacy, and Jihuatang Tai Pharmacy all sell it.
