### 為懲治貪污　內部制定兩辦法
Two Methods Formulated Internally to Punish Corruption
以期造成廉潔風氣
In order to Create a Clean Atmosphere

重慶 Chongqing: The Ministry of Interior has formulated two methods, both short-term and long-term, to punish corruption, in order to create a clean atmosphere and promote domestic administration. The short-term method involves specifying the responsibilities for reporting and accusing, severely punishing corrupt personnel, and holding supervisors who fail to detect and protect them jointly responsible, so that those who embezzle and bend the law will have nowhere to hide. The long-term method involves establishing a personnel system and rigorously implementing budget, accounting, auditing, and public treasury systems, so that embezzlers have no opportunity to use their skills. More importantly, senior officials must strictly supervise and inspect. In addition to ordering various provinces to follow the (Revised Regulations for the Inspection of Civil Affairs Directors and Patrol Chapters in Various Provinces) and (Provisional Regulations for the Organization of Administrative Inspector Commissioners' Offices) and patrol on schedule, the Ministry of Interior also plans to send special inspectors to various provinces to inspect, in order to understand the merits of local officials and assist in conducting assessments.

Editorial: Shanghai Floating Capital Needs to Seek Stability

Since China's War of Resistance, unexpected achievements have emerged; the Northwest and Southwest regions have abundant resources and unique natural endowments. Goods were abandoned on the ground for a long time, but now they are being developed due to the War of Resistance. In the past, the focus of general investors and small-scale operators was always on immediate profits, with no long-term plans. They only operated in the Southeast, along the rivers and coast. Therefore, one side suffered from an excess of floating capital, while the other side suffered from a lack of funds. Now, with the capital moving west and talent shifting inward, the Ministry of Finance, in order to circulate finance in the rear and strengthen economic power, has a two-year plan to complete the financial network in the Southwest, Northwest, and neighboring war zones. The first phase has already been completed. The four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China, have established as many as 154 branches in the Southwest and Northwest, and more than 60 are planned to be established, all of which can be completed within the year. The completed branches include 63 in Sichuan, 18 each in Yunnan and Guizhou, 21 in Guangxi, 2 in Guangdong, 5 in Hunan, 15 in Shaanxi, 14 in Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and 3 in Xikang. In addition, 60 branches will also be added in Zhejiang, Fujian, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. From now on, these branches will use their funds to focus on development and construction, improve people's livelihoods, and fulfill the great wish of resisting and building the country, which is something the Japanese never anticipated. Looking back at the Southeast, the Southeast has always been known for its wealth. All enterprises and circulating capital are concentrated here. It is as if there is an abundance of funds at sea, the markets are prosperous, and trade is thriving. However, what is manifested is speculation and manipulation, hoarding and profiteering, raising the general cost of living, and hindering the proper development of industry and commerce. It is said that bank deposits have increased dramatically. Although the extent of the increase cannot be speculated, the amount must be considerable. Among them, it is heard that demand deposits account for 70 percent. From a theoretical observation of the facts, there is a certain possibility. Since the people of the city compete with speculation and manipulation as their goal, the use of their funds is intended to be convenient for temporary response, so that huge profits can be sought. A small amount of fixed deposit interest is not in their consideration. They naturally tend to deposit and withdraw as demand deposits. Moreover, due to the circumstances of the current situation, all those whose living foundations are not very stable have converted their original fixed deposits into demand deposits upon maturity. This is another reason for the increase in demand deposits. Considering the nature of demand deposits, they are similar to temporary deposits, mainly entrusting the bank to take care of them. Therefore, withdrawals are convenient and interest rates are low. If one is seeking to generate interest, there is certainly no need for demand deposits. For industrialists and merchants, it is appropriate to have demand deposits for business turnover. For general depositors, it gradually becomes a convenient door for speculation and waste. The trend is very different and cannot be ignored. Furthermore, from the perspective of the financial industry, in view of the reduction of fixed deposits and the increase of demand deposits, it is necessary to increase the proportion of reserves for depositors' withdrawals. Investment in industry and commerce can only be done prudently in accordance with the reserves. Investment in industry and commerce requires a relatively long time to recover, so it is necessary to have more fixed deposits to ensure proper use. If demand deposits account for the majority of deposits, the procedures for inflows and outflows are frequent, and the amount available for use is small. This is very unfavorable to the financial industry. Moreover, when there is more floating capital, speculation is rampant. When speculation is rampant, prices soar. When prices rise, speculation becomes even more rampant. When speculation becomes even more rampant, hoarding increases. All these changes in the entire market also cause the financial industry to feel the impact first.
In summary, in recent years, the Southwest has been in a state of vigorous construction, while the Southeast has been gradually deteriorating. Observing the recent situation, there is a tendency to intensify. For example, the soaring prices of cotton yarn, cloth, and gold are beyond the measurement of ordinary reason. Those speculators certainly have their so-called reasons for the upward trend, but the arguments are not absolute, and how can the great principles of human nature allow such resistance to continue for a long time. This is not a pedantic discussion, but the right way of things. Even if prices rise without limit, can purchasing power be unlimited? The limit is when speculators who hoard goods during prosperous times can no longer make profits and cannot dispose of them. If they cannot dispose of them, they will depreciate. If they depreciate, not only will there be no profit, but the capital will flow away. Where is the limit? Speculators hope for this autumn and winter, next year, and the year after, but their desires are insatiable, and their hopes are endless. Their speculation will not stop and will eventually bring trouble upon themselves. But how can they know that the limit is not this summer and spring, and how can they know that it is not right now! Even if it is not right now, it will not be too far off. When the day of the speculator's collapse arrives, it will be the time when the financial world suffers. At that time, the magnitude of the losses suffered by the financial industry will be directly proportional to the amount of assistance it currently provides to speculators.

We have repeatedly and tearfully spoken to those who speculate and hoard goods, both for their private interests and for the public interest of society. Even today, we cannot bear to watch them collapse. It cannot be said that it is their own fault and not worth pitying, but we hope that these people will stop in time and turn back as soon as possible. At the same time, we advise those who have some floating capital not to envy quick profits and speculate, so as to avoid being a "scapegoat" for those who have already made quick profits. Do not prepare to speculate and sacrifice the legitimate interest of fixed deposits. Keep money in demand deposits and seek the convenience of speculation. Do not entrust funds to those who engage in speculation or assist speculators. Furthermore, we hope that financial institutions, in view of the sharp increase in demand deposits, must make proper use of them. In view of the risks of speculation, do not hoard goods, do not aid the evil of speculators, and do not provide them with the convenience of collateral loans. For those who have already provided collateral loans, they must relentlessly demand repayment. National policies and social sanctions have an authority that cannot be underestimated. It is also related to the survival of the financial industry itself.

### 蔣委員長　手頒電令
Chairman Chiang personally issued an order
嘉獎傅作義
To commend Fu Zuoyi
頒給靑大白日勳章
Awarded the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun
發特賞費三十萬元
Issued a special reward of 300,000 yuan
得力官兵分別優敘
Meritorious officers and soldiers were separately commended

重慶 Chongqing: In the recent Battle of Wuyuan, Deputy Commander Fu Zuoyi supervised his troops in bloody battles and was able to defeat the stubborn enemy. Chairman Chiang commended the troops for their bravery and outstanding achievements. In addition to awarding Deputy Commander Fu Zuoyi the most prestigious Order of Blue Sky and White Sun and issuing a special reward, he also issued a special order of commendation. The original order is recorded below:
"Wuyuan is a vital town in Inner Mongolia, shielding the Northwest. This time, Deputy Commander Fu Zuoyi supervised his troops, fought bloody battles for more than a month, lost and regained the city three times, and finally defeated the Japanese and achieved complete victory. This battle not only protected the Northwest but also laid the foundation for the recovery of lost territories. It is a key battle in the overall War of Resistance, and its achievements are remarkable and worthy of praise. Therefore, I specially request the National Government to award Deputy Commander Fu Zuoyi the most prestigious Order of Blue Sky and White Sun. Yuan Chengrong, commander of the XXXX Division under his command, and An Chunshan, regimental commander of the XXX Division, were injured in battle and retreated slightly. They should all be generously rewarded. Jia Shihai, regimental commander of the X Regiment of the Fifth Garrison Brigade, died in battle when attacking Wuyuan City. Song Haichao, regimental commander of the XXX Regiment, took the lead in the vicinity of Wujiahe and was wounded in the leg. He continued to calmly command. His abdomen was struck by three bullets, but he still commanded his troops to fight bravely and eventually died of his injuries. Zhao Shoujiang, the first battalion commander of the 95th Regiment of the XXXX Division, led his entire battalion into Wuyuan City. From Hai Shi on the 20th to Mao Shi on the 21st, he repeatedly charged and killed six times. He was unfortunately shot and killed, but his troops continued to fight bravely and were able to capture strongholds and recover the important town, shattering the Japanese illusion of holding on to strongholds, and pioneering the way for our army's final victory. Therefore, the fallen regimental and battalion commanders will be promoted two ranks to show their excellence. Other fallen officers will be promoted one rank and given a pension. All other meritorious officers and soldiers should have their names and achievements reported in detail for reward and commendation. A special reward of 300,000 yuan is hereby issued to all officers and soldiers. Deputy Commander Fu Zuoyi should properly distribute it to the officers and soldiers of the troops who participated in the Battle of Wuyuan twice to reward them. All local governments are hereby ordered to extend condolences to the families of the officers and soldiers who were killed or wounded in the Battle of Wuyuan on behalf of this Chairman to show remembrance and express mourning. Chiang Kai-shek, personally." (5th telegram)

### 陶希聖在渝　發表一文
Tao Xisheng Published an Article in Chongqing

重慶 Chongqing: Tao Xisheng recently published an article here discussing the issue of the Japanese army withdrawing from China. The article stated that Japan is negotiating this matter, agreeing to the following points: (1) For the sake of joint anti-communism, Japan can station troops in Mongolia and North China. The troop-stationing area in North China includes the area north of the Zhengtai Railway in northern Hebei and Shanxi, and the area along the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong, but the area adjacent to Jinan is not included. (2) Important railways, air routes, transportation ports, and waterways in the troop-stationing area must meet the military needs of the Japanese side, but in peacetime, Japan will respect the administrative rights of the Chinese. (3) When peace is restored, the Japanese army outside the troop-stationing area will withdraw within two years. However, the above agreement actually means that Japanese troops will permanently reside in China, because the exact date for starting troop withdrawal has not been stipulated, and the Japanese side is allowed to permanently station a large part of its troops in China.

### 「華北政委會」　開始辦事
The "North China Political Affairs Commission" Begins Operations

北平 Beijing: The "North China Political Affairs Commission," which was established at the same time as the "New Government" in Nanjing, has now replaced the former Beijing "Provisional Government" and has begun operations. Because the previously prepared budget could not adapt to the new situation arising after the establishment of the North China Political Affairs Commission, various agencies have been ordered to submit their expense budgets for the current fiscal year from April 1st to December 31st within 20 days. The "North China Political Affairs Commission" includes two parts: one is the Secretariat and the Department of Political Affairs, and the other is the six departments of Foreign Affairs, Transportation, Audit, Review, General Affairs, and Intelligence. Wang Yitang serves as the supervisor of the Secretariat, and Wang Kemin, Qi Xieyuan, Tang Erhe, Wang Yintai, Yin Tong, Zhu Shen, and others serve as standing members of the Political Affairs Commission and concurrently serve as the directors of various departments. Therefore, in terms of the main personnel, the Political Affairs Commission is merely a change of name, only changing the provisional name. Judging from the regulations announced by the Political Affairs Commission in the city, the commission seems to be directly controlled by Nanjing, but in practice, it still retains the independence and autonomy of the "Provisional Government." Although the above regulations state that the members are appointed by the "New Government" and approved by the so-called Central Political Conference, the members appointed by the New Government are still people from the semi-autonomous Beijing "Provisional Government." The local authorities in the city seem to be making every effort to conceal the fact that the Political Affairs Commission is nominally controlled by Nanjing and still hold the power to manage the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, as well as the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao. It is heard that the local police station is now assigning police to protect key personnel above the director level to prevent assassination. (5th Reuters telegram)

The Executive Yuan Orders the Continued Operation of County People's Education Centers

重慶 Chongqing: Since the Central Government promulgated the Outline of Organizations at All Levels of Counties, many provinces have doubts about whether the County People's Education Centers should continue to operate. The Ministry of Education, based on statements from the education departments of Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces, believes that the County People's Education Centers are the central organization for implementing social education. After the Outline of Organizations at All Levels of Counties is implemented in various provinces, the County People's Education Centers should also be responsible for guiding social education in the entire county and should continue to operate and enrich their content. The Ministry of Education has requested instructions from the Executive Yuan again, and the Executive Yuan has approved the request to be handled accordingly, and has ordered the education departments of various provinces to comply.

English and French Experts Draft Plan
Establish a Permanent Alliance Relationship
Make Military and Economic Strength One
Filling Blockade Gaps to Force Germany to Submit

London - A diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Mail" recently published an article stating that experts from both England and France are drafting a plan, the goal of which is to establish a permanent alliance relationship between the two sides, ensuring that its strength is sufficient to deter any aggressor in the future. A small committee of cabinet members from both England and France are said to be closely studying the main points of this plan, and once the Supreme Defense Committee of both countries holds its next joint meeting, it will be submitted for discussion. In general, England and France want to establish the closest cooperative relationship, so that the military and economic strength of the two countries can be combined into one, and not only during the current war, but also after the war. "Some responsible people are very supportive of this view, and some even advocate setting up a joint parliament of England and France to deal with all major issues related to mutual interests." Not only that, but after England and France strengthen cooperation in this way, they will create a kind of federal system, and welcome other peace-loving countries to join together.

London - Yesterday, when the Conservative Party met, Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke, saying that when the war began last September, he felt that the Allied countries would win. Now that more than seven months have passed, his belief is ten times stronger than before. Germany's war preparations were far above those of the Allied countries at the beginning of the war. At that time, it was expected that Germany would take advantage of its initial advantage to take oppressive actions without waiting for the Allied countries to calmly make up for its shortcomings, but today there is one thing that is undoubtedly certain: Hitler has missed his chance. Chamberlain also said that the neutral countries' feelings toward the Allied countries are getting better and better. The gaps in the blockade are now being blocked. The effect of the blockade is greater than making Germany bleed. The Allied countries' determination to win will enable the Allied countries to withstand the accelerated blitzkrieg, and not allow any setbacks or disappointments to weaken their determination to win, or support a long-term war. In many months, neither side has the possibility of winning a decisive victory. But whether it is a quick war or a protracted war, he has deep trust in the traditional courage and perseverance of the British nation. (5th Reuters telegram)

London - A special dispatch here said that the general tone of the Norwegian newspapers is that the Western powers have now begun to become stronger and believe that the time for more active warfare has matured. We must not forget the situation when both sides started the war, which was different. Germany had a six- or seven-year plan for its war economy, while the Allied countries only made hasty preparations one year before the start of the war. (5th Reuters telegram)

British Government Seeks Development
Trade with Neutral Countries
Decided to Set Up New Commercial Agencies
The Ministry of Finance provides funds for a permanent nature

London - Finance Minister Simon said in the House of Commons yesterday in response to questions that the government, in order to solve the difficulties in developing trade with neutral countries, has decided to establish a special trading company called "British Commercial Company." Its capital will be provided by the Ministry of Finance. The main task of the company is to develop trade with Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia, and it will be operated as an independent commercial agency. However, in terms of broad policy, it must consult with the government. The government does not want the company to replace existing trade routes, but wants the company to use these routes to the greatest extent possible. The position of chairman will be held by Lord Swinton. According to Reuters, the company is not a temporary company established because of the war, but will become a permanent agency. Although it has the right to engage in direct commerce, most of its duties are to finance trade with the aforementioned countries. It is understood that the establishment of a trading company with capital entirely provided by the government is a pioneering move. The new company's directors include Dr. Beatty, principal of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Sir John Scales, a well-known shareholder of Riley Brothers, Hans Hambro of Hambros Bank, and Nixon, director of the British government's Export Credits Guarantee Department. (5th Reuters telegram)

Paris - The House of Representatives today passed a bill by a show of hands, advocating the establishment of a Supreme Committee for Export Trade within the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, responsible for increasing domestic production and promoting export trade. At the same time, it advocated appropriating 4 million francs to strengthen the organization of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and help it conclude business agreements with various countries on blockade policies. Blanc, the examiner of the case, made a speech on behalf of the government to explain, saying that export trade is necessary for victory during wartime and cannot be ignored. After the establishment of the Supreme Committee for Export Trade, its tasks are nothing more than the following: (1) Maintain regular contact with various industries to pay attention to the development of joint production; (2) Expand the sales channels of domestic export goods, in other words, expand the existing export goods market on the one hand, and open up new markets on the other hand; (3) Try to establish cooperative relations between various departments related to export trade; (4) Consult with the government on various measures to encourage export trade. Minister of Industry and Commerce Rollin then spoke, saying that the establishment of the Supreme Committee for Export Trade will not only not increase the complexity of bureaucratic procedures, but will simplify administrative procedures. During wartime, foreign exchange is needed, and export trade is the only way to obtain foreign exchange, so France must strive to export in order to obtain the necessary foreign exchange.

British House of Commons Scheduled to Hold
Secret Meeting

London - The House of Commons is scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting on the 11th of this month to discuss the progress of the economic war. Informed sources here recently said that this matter originated from the request of opposition Labor Party members. Its main purpose is to listen to the government report on the Supreme Defense Committee of England and France held a joint meeting on the 28th of last month. At the same time, most members also expressed the same desire. The government authorities immediately seized this opportunity to explain some of the policies decided at the last joint meeting. At that time, the opposition Labor Party may inquire about the government's intentions regarding the issue of Scandinavian countries transporting goods to Germany, the relationship between England and the Soviet Union, and the discussion between England and Japan on intercepting Soviet trade with Germany in the Pacific. In addition, how the government should implement various measures to intensify the blockade is also what the Conservative Party members are eager to know. (4th Havas telegram)

British Blockade Measures
Will Expand to the Pacific
Prohibit Goods from Being Transported to Germany via Vladivostok
The Commonwealth of Australia Cooperates Closely with England

London - Recent official statements by the British that it will fully implement its belligerent rights in the Pacific, and the announcement that Australia will cooperate with Britain to jointly prohibit contraband of war, are evidence that Britain has resolved to block a major leak in the blockade and prohibit goods from being transported to Germany by the Pacific and Siberian railways. Yesterday's situation and the announcement of the organization of a Balkan trade company made general observers believe that Britain has not hesitated to launch an effective economic war. It is also generally believed that the government will actively intensify the economic blockade so as to restrain certain criticisms that may arise in the House of Commons' secret meeting. It is also believed that the leader of the opposition may ask the government to give a comprehensive explanation of the claim to implement the blockade and economic war, and officials in the political field expect that Minister of War Economy Cross may inquire at the secret meeting whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has exercised excessive restrictions on the implementation of the blockade. Also, whether the Ministry of Finance restricts the Ministry of War Economy from purchasing goods from neutral countries. (5th United Press telegram)

Amsterdam - According to news from London, Britain's blockade measures in the Pacific are gradually taking concrete form. The Australian Minister of Commerce announced yesterday that from the 8th of this month, Australia will set up multiple control ports to avoid congestion in the British and French control ports in the Far East. At the same time, semi-official London commented on Japan's complaints about the British Navy taking various actions near Japanese territorial waters. The Japanese government unofficially expressed its hope that the British Navy would avoid taking war actions near Japanese territorial waters, but the British government must retain the rights of a belligerent and exercise these rights when necessary. Semi-official sources denied the news of the blockade of Vladivostok, but admitted that it would intercept and search ships sailing to Vladivostok that are suspected of transporting contraband to Germany. (5th Haitong telegram)

London - The "News Chronicle" recently commented on the matter of various contraband goods being transported to Germany via the Soviet port of Vladivostok, stating that a large amount of rubber had recently been transported from that port to Germany. It is heard that this rubber was sold to Japan by the Dutch East Indies and then shipped from Japan to Vladivostok, taking the Siberian Railway to enter Germany. However, the British government has made representations to the Dutch government, requesting to stop such incidents. (5th Havas telegram)

Japan Feels
Neutral Pain
Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Talks

Hong Kong - Tokyo News, the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that after the outbreak of the European War, the status of neutral countries in international trade has become increasingly difficult. This difficulty is due to the restrictive international trade policies adopted by the belligerent countries. The freedom of trade of neutral countries has been greatly violated, and Japan is even more inconvenient due to geographical reasons. In the previous Great War, Japan joined the Allied camp, so it did not suffer the suffering of neutrality, but this time Japan is maintaining neutrality, and the inconvenience felt by the neutral countries is far more serious than expected. At this point, a British reporter interjected and asked humorously, why doesn't Japan participate in the European War to avoid difficulties? The Japanese spokesman smiled and said that Japan is now firmly adhering to the policy of non-intervention. (5th telegram)

After the Munich Conference
France's Attitude towards Eastern Europe
The Process of Signing the French-German Declaration
Germany Continues to Publish White Papers

Berlin - The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday continued to publish the Polish archives' White Paper, which was a report from Polish Ambassador to France Lukasiewicz to the Polish Foreign Minister on December 17, 1938. The original text is as follows:

"Minister's Jianjian, the previous telegram has been inspected, regarding France's foreign policy towards Eastern Europe after the Munich Conference, I would like to elaborate as follows. The most important event was the French-German declaration signed by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris in 1938. After the Munich Conference, France hoped to promote German-French relations, which was undoubtedly initiated by Prime Minister Hitler. When he received French Ambassador to Germany Ponset, (when Reishi was ordered to be transferred to the Ambassador to Italy), Hiroshi expressed his hope for the adjustment of German-French relations to him. The French government expressed a warm welcome, and even hoped to realize it immediately. When I (the Polish ambassador himself) first went to Warsaw at the end of October, French Foreign Minister Bonnet told me that the French-German declaration could be announced and signed at any time. The difficulty was due to two reasons: (1) The drafting of the text of the declaration was more difficult than originally planned; (2) The assassination of Leiter, secretary of the German Embassy in France, in Paris, interrupted the negotiations for two weeks. At that time, French Foreign Minister Bonnet requested not only to recognize the French-German border, but also to recognize the French territory. After the declaration was agreed upon, the German government proposed that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visit Paris. Bonnet immediately expressed his welcome for the sake of internal and external propaganda. Mr. Ribbentrop's visit to Paris was postponed until December 6, 1938, due to the general strike of Parisian workers. Although the government received him cordially, the opposition expressed opposition and suspicion. Now that Mr. Ribbentrop has returned to Germany for just a week, the people of the French capital are greatly disturbed by the return of the Italian ambassador, the Mimer issue, and the Ukrainian incident. The attitude of Germany and Italy has greatly shocked the French people. It is by no means a declaration that can calm them down. The influence of the French-German declaration, in addition to strengthening the government's position and stabilizing the French market, only promoted the conflict between the Daladier government and the extreme right-wingers, especially the Communists. As for the French official attitude towards the French declaration, it is extremely cautious. According to the impression I got from talking with French Ambassador Leger, France hopes that after the conclusion of the French-German declaration, a four-power alliance will be established. It is still difficult to determine whether Leger's words represent the intention of Ambassador Bonnet, but Leger participated in all the meetings during Ribbentrop's visit to Berlin. Therefore, Leger's words almost reflect the attitude of the government. At present, the French-German declaration is a bilateral act in French-German relations, confirming that the western border of France has been recognized by Germany, and there are no longer any territorial issues between France and Germany, at least the integrity of France's empire, except for the trusteeship, has been recognized by Germany. Finally, the relationship between the French and German neighbors has at least improved slightly, because Hitler still regards France as Germany's main enemy in his book "Mein Kampf." On the other hand, economic issues are extremely complicated and require long-term negotiations. In short, the signing of the French-German declaration is regarded by both sides as an important political event. Its fate depends on Berlin, because French policy has not been significantly modified. The French newspapers originally kept silent. After hearing the news of the French-German declaration, some newspapers, such as "L'Humanité", "Le Populaire", "L'Oeuvre", and "L'Ordre", all

The Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting Is About to Open; The Additional Tax Case Is Nearing a Decision; Civic Groups Send Letters to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, Requesting Transmission to the Public Works Department for Reconsideration

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association, along with the thirty-seventh, twelfth, twenty-sixth, eleventh, and twenty-fourth district branches, jointly sent a letter yesterday to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, which stated: "Regarding the Public Works Department of the Public Concession's proposal to increase the municipal general tax, special property tax, land tax, and surcharges by 50% starting from July 1st of this year, both Chinese and foreign taxpayers have expressed opposition due to the unbearable burden. Recent news reports indicate that this proposed tax increase will still be submitted to the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting and seems inevitable. All taxpayers are deeply apprehensive. The fact that the final result of the tax increase will ultimately be borne by the general public is clearly evident. At a time when prices are high and the livelihoods of the common people are on the verge of exhaustion, imposing further tax burdens is tantamount to driving them to desperation, and the issue of public security will undoubtedly become even more serious. In the humble opinion of this association, the most enlightened course of action for the Public Works Department at this time would be to resolutely abandon the tax increase and cope with the difficulties through retrenchment. If it is impossible to pull back from the precipice, then the target of the tax increase should be shifted. Considering the current situation, raising the luxury tax rate might still be feasible. Entertainment venues such as dance halls, theaters, and cinemas are all thriving, and those who frequent them are wealthy and have leisure time. Increasing the tax rate on them would not be harmful. Tax increases targeting the wealthy, without shifting the burden to the common people, would not fail to be a proper source of revenue. As the tax increase proposal is about to be discussed, we are sending this letter to respectfully request your association to convey it to the Public Works Department for consideration."

Over 20,000 Bales of Foreign Cotton Shipped to Shanghai in Four Days
15,000+ Bales of American Cotton

A large quantity of American and Indian cotton is arriving in quick succession. The "Cirpple Breek," a steamship managed by the American President Lines, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 2nd), bringing over 6,000 bales of cotton from the United States. Yesterday, the "Fffingham," also managed by the American President Lines, brought over 9,000 bales of American cotton. The British ship "Sudan" arrived the day before yesterday (the 4th), carrying 7,200 bales of Indian cotton from Mumbai. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the Italian ship "Mong Totto Piana" arrived in Shanghai, carrying a large quantity of foreign rice from Saigon, as well as 608 tons of cotton from Calcutta, estimated at over 2,400 bales. In the past four days, a total of over 24,600 bales of American and Indian cotton have arrived in Shanghai.

Yong An Amusement Company Performs to Raise Funds for Zhongshan Refugees

Shanghai merchants Guo Shun, Ye Chang, and others previously organized the Shanghai Relief Association for Zhongshan Refugees to raise funds for disaster relief, as Zhongshan had suffered repeated calamities. Recently, as Zhongshan has fallen again and relief is urgently needed, they have specially requested the Yong An Amusement Company to perform Cantonese opera for six days, starting on the evening of the 22nd of this month, at the Lyceum Theatre, with Yong An Company General Manager Guo Linshuang personally taking the stage to perform, pleading for the refugees.

Major Fire at Japanese Ammunition Depot Inside Chi Chih University in Jiangwan
Fire Erupted at 8 PM Last Night and Spread Rapidly
Completely Destroyed, Causing Significant Losses

Ping Ming News reports: "Since the withdrawal of the National Army, the Japanese have been using Chi Chih University in Jiangwan as an ammunition depot for quite some time. Unexpectedly, a major fire broke out in the depot at around 8 PM last night. Flames soared, and the fire spread rapidly. The contents of the depot were all explosives, and once ignited, they burned rapidly, emitting continuous explosions. Fire brigades from both Zhabei and Jiangwan rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was brought under control in about an hour. It is reported that the depot was completely destroyed, causing significant losses. The cause of the fire is unknown. One theory is that it was caused by an attack by Chinese guerrillas. After the incident, the Japanese troops stationed there conducted a house-to-house search of nearby villagers, cut off transportation, and strictly interrogated passing pedestrians and vehicles, but to no avail. However, nearby residents have been through a scare."

Various Countries' Merchant Ships Gather Along the Bund
Exceeding Eighty Vessels, Presenting a Lively Scene
Shanghai Possesses Rich Latent Trading Capabilities

The Continental Times reports: "Yesterday (the 4th), the number of various types of merchant ships anchored along the Shanghai Bund, from passenger liners to tugboats, exceeded eighty, the highest number since the Shanghai War of 1937. The flags of over ten countries were flying, presenting a bustling scene unseen for months. The shipping industry feels encouraged by the signs that the Bund seems to have finally recovered its prosperity. In 1937, approximately 20,500 ships called at Shanghai, averaging almost ninety ships per day. Therefore, yesterday's number of ships is comparable to that of 1937. After the Shanghai War broke out in August 1937, the number of ships arriving in Shanghai decreased sharply and has not fully recovered. Some overseas shipping companies once prohibited their ships from coming here, but have gradually realized that the city possesses rich latent trading capabilities. Therefore, there are various signs that overseas merchants are now striving to seize this opportunity. Several new American cargo ships, as well as newly built ships from other countries, are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. In addition to the motor vessel "Red Jacket," which recently brought cotton to Shanghai, several other motor vessels chartered by the U.S. Maritime Commission will also arrive in succession. If the Japanese do not blockade the Yangtze River, the city's trade will certainly be more prosperous. The following factors have a significant impact on the future of Shanghai shipping: (1) Japanese restrictions on shipping in many areas; (2) The "new regime" may control the Yangtze River; (3) The situation in the European war; (4) The future trend of the global economy."

Doctor of Dental Medicine Chen Xianmei Returns Home

After four years, he honorably received a Doctor of Dental Medicine degree with the highest honors. He returned home recently aboard the President Taft. Relatives, friends, and colleagues went to the pier to welcome him. Since the establishment of the University of the Philippines College of Dentistry, Mr. Chen is the second Chinese student to receive this degree, after Yang Zihui from Amoy.

Medicine Industry Selling White Rice at Affordable Prices

The New Medicine Industry Association and the Pharmaceutical Industry Association are selling white rice at affordable prices at the Gih-Yuan Buddhist Temple on Route du Pere Robert, starting from the 3rd of this month. As many poor people are buying, the time will be moved forward by one hour starting today (the 6th), from 9 AM to 12 PM. Three catties of rice will be sold for 20 cents.

Whether Affordable Rice Sales Will Continue
Decision to Be Made Today
Public Works Department Sends Letter of Thanks for Affordable Rice Sales Initiative
Cooperation in Grain Procurement and Sales Difficult to Start

The Shanghai Affordable Rice Sales Committee, in order to continue benefiting the people and carry out affordable rice sales, sent letters to the members some time ago. A full committee meeting will be held today at 2 PM at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road, where a decision will be made on whether to continue the affordable rice sales. The committee hopes that donations will continue to be received from all sectors, in order to accumulate small contributions into a large amount.

Public Works Department Letter

The Public Works Department sent a letter yesterday to Mr. Chu Chia-ching, Chairman of the Chinese Rice Sales Committee, stating: "In response to your letter of the 1st of this month, regarding the affordable rice sales, your committee intends to cease operations after the 7th of this month for a temporary suspension. A separate meeting will be convened in the future to decide whether to continue. Your committee's affordable rice sales have benefited the people and contributed to society, which is highly commendable, and many enthusiastic individuals have generously contributed to this effort, which is greatly appreciated. This is noted with thanks."

Flour Inventory

From February 19th to March 19th, the total amount of affordable flour supplied by the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills was 225,000 bags, with each bag weighing 49 pounds. The factory's affordable price was 10 yuan per bag, averaging 7,500 bags sold per day. Based on the difference between the affordable price and the market price, the two factories suffered a loss of over 800,000 yuan. According to the investigation, the current inventory of flour and wheat in this city is sufficient to meet demand for at least three months. Today, the factories are selling flour to regular customers at 13.80 yuan per bag (weighing 49 pounds). As the arrival of domestic wheat is quite limited, the factories have had to purchase foreign wheat to cope with the demand.

Procurement and Sales Cooperation

The French Municipal Council previously notified the various rice industry groups to discuss the organization of grain procurement and sales cooperation. The Rice and Bean Industry Association is currently collecting opinions. This item was not discussed at the meeting of the Price Stabilization Committee's subcommittee this Thursday because the opinions of the rice industry groups had not been received. It is expected that the organization will be discussed at the next subcommittee meeting after receiving the opinions of the rice industry groups. However, according to the opinions of people in the rice industry, the rice industry in this city is large and extremely complex. If this organization is realized, the brokers and runners who sell and buy on behalf of customers, and even the rice shops that earn commissions, will also have to change their business operations. Therefore, this work is quite difficult to start. The Rice Industry Tea Market will be closed on Sundays starting in April, in accordance with the previous resolution. Therefore, the market will be closed tomorrow.

Shanghai Tea Merchants
Have Difficulty Surviving
Affected by Illegal Control and Hong Kong Sales

Before the war, tea leaves from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces were all gathered and distributed in Shanghai. Later, with the retreat of the Chinese army and the special circumstances, the central government, with tea leaf sales to foreign countries as the main focus, regarding foreign exchange, which could not be arbitrarily traded by private individuals, established the Central Trading Bureau and separately entrusted the China Tea Company and the Fuhua Tea Company to purchase, transport, and sell tea leaves. In the occupied areas, all tea production is controlled by the Welfare Tea Company, which is backed by the Japanese Mitsui Trading Company. For tea transported from Hangzhou to Shanghai, a so-called handling fee of 10 yuan per basket must be paid, not including other miscellaneous expenses, so few people are engaged in this business. Moreover, tea production in Hangzhou is not very abundant, compared to the output of Anhui and eastern Zhejiang, there is little difference. Anhui mainly produces black tea, which is mostly shipped to foreign countries, with London, England, being the main market. Because of foreign exchange settlement, it is absolutely forbidden to transport it to Shanghai. Zhejiang mainly produces green tea, which can still supply the needs of various regions, but it cannot be sold privately to foreign firms. Foreign sales are mainly to France and Africa. The Soviet Union has recently purchased a considerable amount due to special circumstances. Previously, tea leaves from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces were concentrated in Shanghai, but now they are all transported to Hong Kong for export. Therefore, Shanghai tea merchants have been greatly affected and have difficulty surviving. Fortunately, the population has increased due to the war, and sales seem to be more brisk than usual. However, it is complicated and costly to transport large quantities of goods to Shanghai, and the selling price is inevitably more expensive. Recently, the puppet organization, coveting profits, is planning to impose control again, squeezing every bit of value out, but the specific methods have not been disclosed. If there is such heavy exploitation, consumers will suffer greatly, and merchants will not be able to make a profit. Therefore, Shanghai tea merchants are currently taking a wait-and-see attitude, and will determine their business strategy after the new tea can be transported to Shanghai.

Vegetables Disappear on Hongqiao Road
Puppet "Market" Branch Opens
Stepped Up Interception of Goods Coming from Western Shanghai

Since the puppet "Central Market" began operating, it has gradually increased the seizure of vegetables from various places. Therefore, the Bailinan Road branch in western Shanghai officially began operating yesterday, and Japanese and puppet military police were dispatched to Hongqiao Road, Zhongshan Road, Xietu Road, and Daxilu Road in western Shanghai to step up interception. From yesterday, vegetables transported to Shanghai have disappeared on Hongqiao Road. Vegetables sold in Xujiahui Town are all purchased in bulk from Bailinan Road and transported back by hired laborers. Prices have soared, and citizens will have to bear more burdens.

Fire in Ruihua Lane

At 7:30 yesterday morning, a fire broke out at the home of Yang Gendi, a resident of No. 5 Ruihua Lane, Route Lafayette, which quickly spread to the sun deck of No. 6 next door, and then affected the home of a woman named Hu Yuanbao on the third floor of No. 7. The fire was extinguished by the fire brigade after receiving the news. No. 7 suffered the most damage, while Nos. 5 and 6 suffered minor damage.

Japanese Female Ticket Collectors
Claim to Have Been Deceived into Coming to China
Working 18 Hours a Day Is Unsustainable
Company Refuses Request and They Have Resigned En Masse

The Continental Times reports that 43 Japanese female ticket collectors employed by the Japanese-owned Huazhong Urban Automobile Company resigned en masse on the 3rd of this month because their request to reduce working hours was rejected by the company. These women were hired from Japan last September and work 18 hours a day, earning 1.66 yuan per day. They had repeatedly requested the company to improve their working conditions, such as one day off per month, reduced working hours, and equal treatment. The company did not respond until the 3rd, when it granted one day off per month and equal treatment for domestic and foreign employees, but refused to reduce working hours. The female ticket collectors submitted a "final request" yesterday, but the company still did not change its attitude and stated that if the female ticket collectors did not return to work by noon yesterday, they would have to move out of the company dormitory. A female ticket collector told a reporter from the Continental Times that when the company recruited people in Tokyo, they were told that their job after arriving in Shanghai would be to supervise Chinese female ticket collectors. Now they know they have been deceived. They all want to return home, because not only have they not saved any money since arriving in Shanghai, but they are also in debt. The English-language Great American Evening News reported that 43 female ticket collectors went on strike yesterday, and five or six of them had returned to work in less than twelve hours.

Two Vehicles Collide Last Night on Nanjing Road
Public Bus and Tram Collide Violently
Traffic Halted for About Half an Hour

At around 10 PM last night, public bus No. 15057, driven by driver No. 182, was traveling east on Nanjing Road at the intersection of Shandong Road (Wangping Street). Tram No. 97, driven by driver No. 554, was speeding west. The public bus driver was momentarily careless and collided with the tram. Because both sides were driving at full speed, the collision was very violent. The upper level of the public bus was heavily damaged, and the windows were completely shattered. The tram was also damaged. Several passengers were cut by falling glass, bleeding profusely, and got off the bus to go to the hospital for treatment. Traffic was blocked for about half an hour.

### Fifth Session of the National Political Council: Discussions on Constitutional Government Begin; Sun Ke Reports on the Drafting Process and Content of the Constitution; Chiang Hopes Councilors Will Express Their Opinions Freely

Chongqing, On the 5th, the National Political Council continued its review of proposals in separate committee meetings at 10:00 AM. At 3:00 PM, the fifth session was held, which was also the first day of the current session for discussing proposals. Almost all councilors attended. The government officials' seats, special guests' seats, press seats, and audience seats were all full. A total of 147 people were present, including Chairman Chiang, Vice-Chairman Zhang, Secretary-General Wang, and councilors such as Zhang Shenfu. More than 30 heads of various agencies were present, including Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Kong Xiangxi, Xu Shifu, Ye Chucang, Zhang, Zhu Jiahua, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Zhou Zhongyue, and Weng Wenhao, as well as Committee members Chen Bulei and Shao Lizi. The meeting started punctually at 3:00 PM, presided over by Chairman Chiang, who led the ceremony. The minutes of the fourth session were read, followed by the written administrative report of the Supervisory Yuan. Then, Legislative Yuan President Sun reported on the drafting process and content of the Republic of China Constitution Draft ("May 5th Constitution Draft"), which took one hour. After a 15-minute break, discussions began. The Chairman submitted for discussion the draft amendment to the Republic of China Constitution drafted by the Constitutional Government Promotion Council, consisting of 138 articles in full, and the report. After reading, Councilor Zhang Junli, the convener, gave an oral explanation of the Constitutional Government Promotion Council's meeting process and the reasons for amending each point, especially regarding the establishment of a National Assembly Political Council during the adjournment of the National Assembly as a regular agency for implementing public opinion, which he explained in great detail, lasting 40 minutes. At this point, the Chairman stated that during the discussion of the Constitution Draft, he hoped that all councilors would freely and openly express their opinions to achieve a satisfactory result. He also hoped that everyone would pay attention to the distinction between political power and administrative power, and the division between "power" and "ability," as specially clarified by the Prime Minister, and especially to consider the current political realities, emphasizing that the Constitution must be flexible to ensure its smooth implementation. The time was 6:30 PM, and the Chairman announced the adjournment. The case will continue to be discussed at the sixth session. In addition, there were several proposals submitted by the government at this National Political Council meeting, which, together with those submitted by the councilors, excluding temporary motions, totaled 78. Among them, the ones that are likely to spark the most heated discussions are the Constitutional Government Promotion Council's proposed amendments to the "May 5th Constitution Draft" and various proposals to stabilize commodity prices. There are as many as ten proposals to stabilize commodity prices, and a (Special Committee) has been formed to specifically review them. (5th dispatch)

Communist Party Leaders Arrive in Chongqing Together

Hong Kong, A source close to the Chinese government recently received news from Chongqing that Qin Bangxian and Lin Zuhan, two important figures of the Chinese Communist Party, had indeed arrived in Chongqing yesterday. According to the two, after the recent negotiations between the Kuomintang and Communist Party authorities, satisfactory progress has been made on the issue of further cooperation between the two parties, and it is hoped that friction will not occur again in the future. It is also said that another leader of the party, Zhou Enlai, may arrive in Chongqing today. (5th Havas News Agency dispatch)

Chongqing, Qin Bangxian (pen name Bogu), Deng Yingchao (Zhou Enlai's wife), and Lin Zuhan, three main leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, arrived here yesterday to attend the fifth session of the National Political Council. It is reported that Zhou Enlai recently injured his arm in an accident in Moscow and is now recuperating in Xi'an, unable to come to Chongqing to attend the meeting. In addition, Communist Party leaders Chen Shaoyu (pen name Wang Ming) and Wu Yuchang (transliteration), a veteran party member, are currently in the Northwest, bound by their duties, and did not come to Chongqing either. It is unlikely that Qin Bangxian and the other two will put forward any important proposals at this session of the National Political Council, as the time for submitting proposals at the meeting had already expired when they arrived in Chongqing. (5th Reuters dispatch)

### Desolate Scenery in Zhabei—A Qingming Festival Inspection Record—

Every year during the lunar Qingming Festival, the roads in Zhabei are usually very lively. From morning till night, men and women in colorful clothes, carriages and horses, and endless streams of people carry wine, dishes, paper ingots, and other items to various guild halls, public offices, and villas to pay respects and sacrifices before the coffins of the deceased. Since the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, most of the above-mentioned establishments have been destroyed by artillery fire. For example, the Huzhou Guild Hall on Huiwen Road, all the coffins in it were completely burned. Yesterday, I saw that the gate had also been dismantled and turned into a field of rubble. The Changsheng Public Office at the northern end of the same road has disappeared without a trace. The Yanshu Villa is tightly closed, and the surrounding walls have also collapsed. The gate of the Xijin Public Office on Zhonghua New Road facing west is blocked with bricks, and a small door has been opened for entry and exit, but no one is seen entering or leaving. The Haichang Public Office on Gonghe New Road has several burned-out houses. I saw several coffins there before, but their whereabouts are now unknown. All the houses have been completely demolished. The Jiaguo Guild Hall on Taiyang Temple Road and the Qianjiang Guild Hall on the same road facing west have also collapsed completely, leaving no trace. Most of the coffins remaining after the fire have been moved out. All the auditoriums and other buildings of the Pushan Villa on Pushan Road have also been burned down. Although some of the ancestral halls of the Wujiang Guild Hall and the Yangzhou Eight Counties Public Office on the same road still exist, few people go to visit them. Only the four walls of the Jianghuai Public Office remain, and the interior is completely destroyed. It has now moved to No. 5 Zhongshan Road. The Guangzhao Villa on Changan Road in the West District has the largest area and the most severe damage. On the roads, I saw groups of three or five patrolling Japanese Marines carrying bricks and trucks coming and going, but otherwise there were few pedestrians and the atmosphere was unusually desolate.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed editor:

I have read the news in your newspaper on March 29th regarding Xu Qizhong's separation from Ms. Xu Meiying, which does not correspond to the facts. It is stated that Xu Qizhong was forced to declare bankruptcy in the winter of the 24th year of the Republic because Ms. Meiying was extravagant and lived an extremely luxurious life, exhausting his efforts to provide for her, costing him a huge sum of 100,000 yuan, and leaving him burdened with debts that he could not repay. This is a slanderous accusation that I cannot remain silent about. Ms. Meiying was unfortunately born a woman and was seduced by Xu Qizhong, who ruined her virginity. At the time, Xu Qizhong pursued her ardently and insisted that Ms. Meiying sign a cohabitation contract through lawyers Ye Shaoying and Dong Chi. Seeing his sincere attitude and firm determination, Ms. Meiying could not bear to reject his kindness, and so she reluctantly agreed. But how long did it take for Xu Qizhong to abandon his old love and become acquainted with Chen Hailun, Ke Zhizhen, and many others, spending his money recklessly and indulging in pleasure, resulting in huge debts. Ms. Meiying repeatedly advised him, but he ignored her pleas, even demanding that Ms. Meiying pawn her jewelry to make up for his insufficient funds, persisting in his delusion to this extent. Later, when his coercion failed, he threatened her in every way, and Ms. Meiying was eventually driven away. The ruthlessness of his methods cannot be described. The report that she took advantage of his absence and fled with her clothes is clearly untrue. Although the initial trial of the counterclaim was rejected, it is difficult to accept. The cohabitation contract was originally requested by Xu Qizhong, but he denied his previous statement in the first trial, which is something that anyone with a conscience would not do. After the trial, Ms. Meiying believed that the investigation was not thorough enough, so she decided to appeal according to the law after the judgment is delivered. However, the contents of your newspaper's report are largely inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, I am writing to request that you correct it to clarify the truth. This is what I earnestly hope for.

Sincerely,

Sheng Meiying

April 5th

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Futures Experience Slight Fluctuations

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the listed exchange rates. The black market for British and American exchange rates remained uninteresting, with narrow fluctuations and a lack of attention. The spot market remained stable throughout, while the futures market experienced fluctuations. Although the US-British exchange rate initially returned to 75, all exchange rates remained unchanged after opening, showing extreme stability. Suddenly, speculators began selling forward contracts, and the futures market immediately turned bearish. With a lack of buying interest and the continuous emergence of speculators, it was difficult to escape the loose situation. At that time, the US dollar for this month was 6.0625 yuan, but the spot market was not affected. The spot market remained flat in the afternoon. It was reported that the foreign exchange market in Tianjin was tight, and a certain bank was aggressively buying forward shillings. Speculators were unhappy with selling US dollars, so the market softened slightly. In the end, the US dollar futures market remained loose, while the spot market and British exchange rates remained flat. Trading was quite active.

Speculative Selling of Forward Contracts

At the beginning of the morning, London cables showed recent declines of 1.875 and forward declines of 1.25. New York silver prices remained flat. London gold remained unchanged. Exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai, and France were flat. The US dollar against the British pound was 75, unchanged against Shanghai, and up 25 against France. Central Bank listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening selling prices for spot rates at banks were 4 pence 125 for British pounds and 6.125 yuan for US dollars, both flat from the previous close. At the same time, the opening prices for futures were also flat. After opening, speculators first came to release forward contracts, causing the futures market to become bearish. A speculator sold US dollars for May to a certain bank for 5.875 yuan, and another sold US dollars for June to China Bank for 6.03125 and 0625 yuan. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank announced the fixed rate and the balance tax for silver was announced to be reduced by 1.25 points. After that, speculators continued to emerge, and the market continued to weaken. China Bank absorbed US dollars for May from speculators for 9.0125 yuan. Later, a certain bank and speculators mutually transferred US dollars for June to China Bank for 6.0625 yuan. At this time, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank released spot shillings to its counterparts for 4 pence 125. Trading volume decreased at noon, and the situation was very stable. Until the close, spot prices were similar to the morning opening, while futures were all.

The selling wind turned weak in the afternoon

The situation remained quiet in the afternoon, with prices no different from the morning.

In the afternoon, gold shops continued to buy relentlessly. Afterwards, rumors spread that the Tianjin exchange rates had narrowed, and gold shops accelerated their purchases, with retail investors following suit, sending prices straight up, reaching a daily high of 5,470 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Strengthened in the Afternoon

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw ample supply in the morning, and prices continued to decline.

### Securities: Government Bonds Soar, Industrial Stocks Skyrocket

In the black market for securities, the bullish trend intensified yesterday, with a truly meteoric rise. Brokers were covering their short positions wildly, and market prices rose in a straight line, creating new highs not seen in half a year. Bonds of types "E" and "D" broke through the 50 yuan mark and continued to advance, while bonds of type "A" also reached high prices above 60 yuan. Trading volume surged, and the situation was extremely favorable. Later, because the high market prices attracted the delivery of physical bonds, the market bought heavily, but the supply of chips was abundant. With consecutive days of gains, the trend was too strong, and there was fear of a reversal. Therefore, the rise in bond prices was based solely on short covering and had no legitimate reason. Throughout the day, Lianhe, Jiufeng, and Renchang were the most aggressive in covering their positions. For a time, the sound of buying orders reverberated throughout the city, and retail short sellers were almost completely covered. Xinfu, Yongkang, Yongfeng, Tiansheng, and Hengfu all had demand. Lianyi, Tongshun, Maotaiyi, Guotai, Feng, and others all had selling pressure. The prices rose by 6 to 7 jiao in the morning.

As a result, they continued to rise by another 8 jiao to 1 yuan and 5 fen. The transaction volume reached over 2.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

In stock trading, 50 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 11 yuan. The stock market closed with most industrial stocks recovering as a result of competitive buying. The only unique feature was the sharp rise in the stock of China Reclamation and Afforestation, because according to news, the price of coal in North China has increased by 50 percent. The opening price in the morning was only 14.5 yuan, but due to continuous price increases from various parties, prices gradually rose, and buying pressure did not subside throughout the day. The closing price was 16.7 yuan for buying and 9 jiao for selling. The buyers were very satisfied, and the trading volume set a record for the highest in the history of the stock. The Shanghai Silver Company advanced to 27 yuan, because it held a large number of China Reclamation and Afforestation shares. The International Trust stock also rose slightly to 24.75 yuan. The Yangzi Silver Company stock was 16.1 yuan, the British United stock was 38 yuan, and China Business and Business Customs stocks also attracted attention at that price.

### Grain: Preparing for Changes in the Domi Market, Selling Goods Sheltered for Protection, Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrive Again, and Some Are Shipped Directly to Japan

The sluggish rice market tightened slightly the day before yesterday afternoon. The market was quite firm yesterday morning, carrying the momentum from the previous day. Sellers shouted higher prices, and the sales market also saw activity from rural customers. At that time, the prices of various foreign rice saw a rebound of 6 to 7 jiao. For example, No. 1 Saigon opened at 44 yuan, and small high-quality varieties opened at 39.2 yuan. However, afterwards, sales were not smooth, and floating speculators took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing the market to fall as soon as it rose. The final result saw No. 1 Saigon still at 43.5 to 43 yuan, high-quality varieties at 42.5 yuan, small patterns at 38.8 yuan, Tokyo high-quality varieties falling from 40 yuan to 39 yuan, and other mixed broken rice and rice products were similar to the previous day's prices. As for japonica and glutinous domestic rice, the sources are gradually becoming abundant, but due to the warm weather, the bodies of the goods stored outside the boundary for a long time are weak and will change, making it difficult to keep them for long. Moreover, most cargo owners heard that there will be a ban lifted in the interior in the near future, so they thought of selling quickly. As a result, 2,000 to 3,000 packages continued to be transferred from the Hongkou District yesterday, and the sales market was normal. The price of glutinous rice did not fluctuate much because it was already low. The black market for thick and thin japonica rice and early and late rice was sparse, and it was heard to be slightly weaker by about half a yuan. Kunxi japonica rice was 45 yuan to 43.5 yuan, Qingsi extra-thin was 44 yuan, central market varieties were 42-43 yuan, and Nangang early rice was still 41 yuan.

Large batches of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Italian ship "Montopia Ana" arrived at 2:00 PM and docked at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf, carrying 2,025 tons of foreign rice from Saigon, equivalent to over 21,000 packages, and unloading has begun. There were also 1,151 tons of foreign rice bound for Kobe, Japan, and 1,011 tons bound for Yokohama. Once the cargo for this city is unloaded, it will go to Japan for unloading. It can be seen that Japan's domestic rice shortage is not small, and in addition to scraping Chinese rice, it is also purchasing large quantities of foreign rice from Vietnam and Siam. Although a small amount is transferred through Shanghai, the number of direct shipments is very large. In addition, the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship, carrying 5,672 packages of foreign rice from Hong Kong, also arrived in Shanghai at about 5:00 PM yesterday and is scheduled to be unloaded today.

### Yarn Flowers Cotton Yarn Reactionary Decline

The yarn market continued to be weak, and a downward trend slightly emerged. In reality, after the consecutive sharp rises, the volume was substantial, and there should have been a possibility of a reactionary decline. At the same time, foreign exchange also appeared weak, and gold slightly decreased, so people's minds were naturally a bit indifferent. According to market sources, a certain major player took profits and exited the market, and the amount was huge, so the chips on the table were relatively loose. From this perspective, the yarn market may retreat a small step.

The current yarn market opened in the morning with a peaceful atmosphere, and a certain major bull, seeing the tense market atmosphere, suddenly maintained the market and released a large batch of yarn, and the market situation suddenly loosened. The opening price was 1,165 yuan, and soon fell to 50 yuan. Later, due to many buyers coming, it rose again to 70 yuan, but with the major player selling, the chips surged, and as a result, it entered a tired path again. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day totaled 1,580 bales, excluding the transactions in April. The transactions amounted to 2,300 bales, totaling still more than 2,000. According to yarn exports, today (6th) there were 505 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, and another 181 pieces shipped to Xiamen. The amount of each trade purchased is listed as follows:

### Foreign Cotton is Booming

Middling 275.00 Same trade entered 300 pieces

Good Ordinary 207.25 Same trade entered 300 bales

20 count American Middling 286.80

Also Lower grade 276.50

30 count Same 302.70

New York's recent price in these five days has fallen slightly by 50 cents, converted to the Shanghai market, each picul has fallen by more than 1,000 yuan. However, these transactions are mostly speculative purchases, so the Shanghai export market price yesterday opened at 4,750 yuan for white factory silk, only 300 yuan lower than last week. Yesterday's exports were quiet, foreign firms were sluggish, and the price of silk for users was better than foreign firms, but only sporadic transactions.

Compared with the same month last year, imports decreased by 5,535 piculs, sales decreased by 416,178 piculs, and the inventory increased by 22,771 piculs, accounting for nearly 50%. Therefore, the silk price at the beginning of April had a downward trend because of this.

And the large-scale production of new rayon, which has the same effect as silk, also has a great impact. It is recently heard that 100,000 dozen new rayon stockings will appear on the New York market, so the situation of raw silk in the future will add another strong enemy.

(1) First calculate the percentage of capital and surplus to be 39%, and less than 40% (25,000 - 65,000 - 3970 and other numbers can be ignored), that is, the "Yin" and "Mao" items in the previous simplified calculation table,

(2) Secondly, check the simplified calculation table "Yin" item, the tax accumulated number is 125 yuan, multiply 125 yuan by 6.5 (because the capital amount in this example is 65,000 yuan, which is 6.5 times the capital amount in the table), that is, get 812 yuan and 50 cents

(3) Multiply the capital by 30% of the "Yin" item to get 19,000 yuan, and then subtract 19,000 yuan from the surplus of 25,500 yuan to get 6,000 yuan,

(4) Next, check the tax rate under the "Mao" item in the simplified calculation table to be 20%, so multiply 6,000 yuan by 20% to get 1,200 yuan

(5) Add the first item of 812 yuan and 50 cents and the fourth item of 1,200 yuan to get 1,012 yuan and 50 cents, which is the total amount of profit tax to be paid.

### Old Newspaper News Sixty-seven Years Ago (446)

(See this newspaper in the twelfth year of Tongzhi of the late Qing Dynasty)

Novel Swindling Technique

Recently, a Chinese merchant in Penang received a letter. When he opened it, he found another silk envelope inside, which he was extremely surprised! When he opened it again, he saw a poem written on a yellow silk, first mentioning the merchant's virtue, and then saying that if he could continue to do good deeds, heaven would surely bestow blessings upon him, etc., without giving a name below. He hurriedly summoned the person who delivered the letter and asked where the letter came from. The person replied that he met an unknown person on the road who entrusted him to forward it and offered a reward for it. He was instructed to send a reply to Wang Daosheng at a certain shop. The Chinese merchant went to the shop to inquire the next day. The person immediately invited him to go out together, saying that he had met a white-haired immortal on the top of a very high mountain in Jiangxi. The immortal asked him if he knew a certain merchant in Fuzhou. He replied that he did not know. The immortal then handed him a letter and instructed him to forward it, saying, "If you receive a penny, you will be struck by lightning!" He then handed him another letter, saying that the merchant should only be allowed to see it after he had done another great good deed. The merchant insisted on seeing the second letter, but the person firmly refused. The merchant repeatedly pleaded and offered to befriend him. Afterwards, they visited each other day and night, and there were occasional banquets, with both sides acting as hosts, but the merchant still could not see the letter. One day, Wang Daosheng said to the Chinese merchant, "A certain temple is in disrepair after many years. The gods enshrined there are very effective. If you want to see the second letter, you might as well donate money to repair it. This is also a great good deed." At that time, the Chinese merchant was already suspicious of his trickery and strongly demanded to see the second letter first. Wang Daosheng had no choice but to take it inside. There was another silk envelope, just as before. When he opened it, there was only ashes. The person said that the immortal was very angry! You should immediately cultivate virtue to ward off the disaster, otherwise there will be trouble. The Chinese merchant became even more suspicious. At this point, he declared that he was bewitching him with妖言 and demanded that he tell the truth. He threatened to lock him up and send him to the authorities, waiting for the white-haired immortal to come and release him. The person was afraid and admitted that he intended to swindle him. The merchant laughed it off.

### The Third Type of Woman

— Huang Jiayin

There are three types of women in the world.

The first type of woman contributes the most to society. She is employed and manages the household. She uses her brain and is willing to use her hands. She is the most conscious and useful woman.

The second type of woman, due to environmental, ability, and time constraints, can only choose one between employment and household management.

The third type of woman has the best circumstances but is the most muddled. She is an idle person who knows nothing but enjoyment. In society, she is like a beautiful walking corpse, with no practical contribution.

In today's enlightened world, we should certainly no longer confine women at home. However, due to the current realistic environment, we cannot ask every woman to be employed. As long as the family system exists, we cannot regard household management as worthless.

In fact, the key to the women's issue today is not the dispute between employment and household management, but whether women make a real contribution to society. Whether they can make a real contribution.

Here, the problem is the third type of woman. They are the happiest leaf, but also the least ambitious leaf. Under the畸形的 current social system, they can still survive as superfluous people. However, we believe that in a reasonable society, there is no room for the third type of woman.

Today's third type of woman should wake up as soon as possible, take advantage of their excellent opportunities to learn, enrich themselves, and become the first or second type of woman, so as to avoid being eliminated by society.

### Befriending Poverty

— Zhou Suwu

Like most people, I hope to live a comfortable and happy life, but my encounters are completely opposite to my hopes. I lost my father when I was young. I only have my mother and a younger sister. My father did not leave any family property when he died, so for more than ten years, we have always lived a hard life, befriending poverty.

I grew up in this situation. However, I have never felt颓废不振 because of this. I always try my best to struggle with the environment. After the war broke out, we took refuge in Shanghai. The level of living has greatly increased, but we still try our best to think of various ways to maintain it. I believe that an optimistic attitude and a hard-working spirit will produce great power for a person's future.

My sister and I continue to study. I also use my spare time to do some things and earn some money, which is also a small supplement to the family's economy.

I feel that everyone, especially people in poor environments, should try their best to use their time to learn various skills, because the more things you know, the more opportunities you have to find a "饭碗". This makes it easier to solve your difficult problems. As for myself, I have done many different odd jobs, such as typing, stencil cutting, tutoring, and shorthand.

At the same time, I feel that "self-confidence" is also a necessary condition for struggling in difficulty. It can encourage us, make us move forward bravely, without fear; it can make us unyielding, not discouraged by small setbacks. On the journey of life, "self-confidence" will produce the most miraculous deeds.

Recently, I found another job during the day, which is a relatively stable occupation. In the evening, I am still studying at school. Working and studying at the same time, I am very happy, and I don't feel overly tired.

I firmly believe in this sentence: "Poverty is not an insurmountable obstacle, but rather a stimulus for people to move upward,鍛煉 people's minds and bodies, and make people succeed."

I know that there are really countless young people in China who have the same encounters as me. I hope that everyone can work hard to struggle with the environment, cross this obstacle, and the future will be bright and beautiful!

### Swallows

— Ruozhuo

The willows have released their affectionate eyes, the peach blossoms are showing their dimples of laughter, the sunlight is warm, the breeze is gentle, and nature clearly tells people: Spring has come! With the arrival of spring comes the swallow, this lively little thing, a wandering little traveler.

It is said that the homes of the swallows are overseas, at the edge of the sky, where there is a deep blue sky and a bottomless blue sea; but those cannot keep them, they have a free heart that is inclined to spring, and they let this heart drive them. Every year, after inquiring about the location of spring, they form groups, flap their wings, cross the ocean, and climb over the mountains, conquering their long and arduous journey.

On a drizzly morning, or in the dim twilight of willow banks and blooming flowers, you can see their lithe silhouettes, or the lovely姿態 of "flying close to the ground." They are content with their circumstances, and never suffer from颠沛流离. They come when they want to come, and leave when they want to leave, with complete freedom. They are truly the gypsies among birds.

When the autumn wind rises and rolls down the leaves, all the chaos and desolation stir their homesickness. They go back, unwilling to be attacked by the north wind, nor willing to be oppressed by the heavy frost. They go back, they flap their wings and embark on the journey again, they have the freedom to change their lives - all freedom.

What about us? People - the spirit of all things, hum! The spirit of all things, we are a pool of stagnant water, a frog in a well, we lack that kind of freedom. Every day, every day, walking, talking, we must follow礼知耻 to show that we are gentlemen, we are controlled by a kind of magic, under the control of this magic, we are unable to use nature.

I wish I had the figure and wings of a small swallow, flying, flying, flying to Utopia, flying to the Peach Blossom Spring, drifting and wandering as much as possible, transcending this evil web of human forces, and returning to nature!

Friends, do you think this view of life is right?

### Portrait of an Echo Worm

— Lini

The Echo Worm is a very amiable person; his back is bent, his face is plastered with a string of smiles, his tone of voice is slow, and he intersperses a few not very presumptuous hahas in the middle, very polite.

When he meets you, he can't come up with anything to say for a while, so he smiles docilely and says, "The weather today, hahaha!" While speaking, he stares at you with gentle eyes; when you open your mouth, he listens with a serious look, as if he is enjoying it very much! If you have not yet expressed your opinion on a certain matter, he will raise his head as if something is wrong and say to you, "What do you think, haha," if you still do not answer, he will chase after you and say, "Really: you old前辈 have no reason not to understand! You... hahaha, you are too kind!"

So you express your opinion, and he listens with great enthusiasm. When you talk about a thing you hate, he will pull a long face and interject, "Hey, really混账东西! I also hate it to the bone, why is it only you old前辈!" Although he speaks excitedly, he still has not lost his respectful appearance, and waits until you finish speaking, he immediately says excitedly, even wanting to slap the table to show that the words are pertinent and to the point, and agrees with you, "That's right! It couldn't be more right! Your old前辈's opinion is really like mine, as if it was born in my stomach. If you old前辈 didn't say it, I would have wanted to say it too! Really, a joke and a strange story! We have to do it this way! I knew early on that you old前辈 had your own unique insights, and sure enough, it didn't come as a surprise!" While speaking, he bows again and again to show his admiration.

The next day, he meets you again. Before you open your mouth, he brings up yesterday's matter again, and he says, "I thought carefully about yesterday's matter, and I feel that your old前辈's opinion is really the most correct..." If you overturn your own opinion of yesterday today, he immediately lowers his head and thinks deeply, making a look of consideration, and after a while, he follows your opinion and asks you in return, "Um... there are indeed some difficulties in the middle,... I thought... can't we do it this way? What do you old前辈 think?" Because he follows your opinion, naturally you nod your head and praise it, so he seems to say very firmly, "Isn't that right? I knew early on that there was something wrong with it, right? You old前辈 saw the flaw"! While he is speaking, he still has to add a sentence: "After all, you old前辈 have foresight!"

The echo worm himself has no preconceived notions, holding an attitude of nothing is impossible; he hears you say very good, he also has to say almost, he hears you say it won't work, he also has to say it is unforgivable to kill. If your age is equal to or a little older than him, he calls you old前辈 again and again, saying horizontally that you are experienced and firmly saying that your knowledge is perfect. If your age is smaller than him, he will shake his head again and again and say, "We old朽 are really outdated! You are really後生可畏, one generation is better than another!" Saying that, he touches his beard, indicating that he is old and useless.

The echo worm is also one of the indispensable people in different groups in society. He does not move forward bravely, and dares not be the first in everything, but he is very凑趣, he is willing to do voluntary publicity for people, and he is also willing to voluntarily搜觅 materials and evidence for people, and the better thing to take is: that unhumble and unrespectful appearance makes people feel comfortable in their hearts.

However, the echo worm is ultimately不行, because he is a帮闲者.

Occupation

### The Sovereignty of Occupation

— Shao Xiongfei

People who are generally employed often have three kinds of psychology: (1) Why is my ability unknown to anyone? Why is no one using it? (2) Before getting a job, they are only afraid of not getting it; after getting a job, they are dissatisfied. (3) They are always afraid of being unemployed.

I think these three kinds of psychology are wrong. If you have the ability, even if you are not successful now, it is like a diamond hidden in the gravel. Sooner or later, someone will discover it and someone will regard it as a treasure. After people get the diamond, they will definitely not abandon it like mud and sand. They are only afraid that they are not diamonds, not gold and silver, not copper, iron, tin, and zinc, but mud and sand, but fake diamonds. Then, sooner or later, they will be discovered and sooner or later, they will be abandoned. False pride, deceit, and confusion are our big evils.

The sovereignty of occupation. Is in me, not in others. Moreover, since ancient times, there has been a sigh of "人才难". If it is "才", why be afraid of not having an occupation? Some people are not completely without ability, but they always扯烂污 and搭桨 everywhere. And they think they are clever. In the end, they撒了自己的烂污 and搭了自己的桨. The harm to others is limited, and their own losses are infinite. This is even more bitter and even more not worth it! (Move compensation to save the disaster)

### Jesus Said, "Let the Little Children Come to Me" (Part 2)

Let me tell you another story: A farmer in England long ago had eight sons. The youngest was named Joe, and he was physically weak and mentally slow. He wasn't talented at studying and lacked the strength to work. His parents and brothers all considered him useless and didn't know what to do with him. One day, his father and brothers were in the field cutting wheat, and they asked Joe to drive the ox cart to transport the wheat bundles back home. However, halfway there, for some reason, the wheat, the cart, and the ox all overturned. His father chased after him, pointed at his face, and said, "You are such a useless child!" Back home, a family meeting was held, and they decided to send him to the city to earn a living. So, Joe was sent to a fabric store to become an apprentice. But Joe had one excellent habit, which he wished every child would learn from him: he always went to church and Sunday school every Sunday to observe the Sabbath. One Sunday, he heard the pastor preach, and one sentence greatly moved his heart. The pastor said, "Even if you are a useless person, if you rely on Jesus and believe in Him, He will surely make you useful, make you of great use." Joe returned to the store and pondered these words. That night, behind the counter, he knelt down and prayed to Jesus, saying, "Lord Jesus! People say I, Joe, am useless. I am indeed useless. I have heard that you can turn the useless into the useful, into the greatly useful. I now come to rely on you, believe in you, and ask you to accept me. I am willing to be your follower. Amen!" From that day on, the Lord Jesus accepted Joe. Joe loved Jesus, loved to pray, loved the Bible, and liked to lead people to church and Sunday school. Whenever he had free time, he gathered his fellow apprentices to read the Bible and pray. Gradually, the number of people in his Bible study group increased. Later, these young Christians founded an association called the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). From small beginnings, it later spread all over the world. When Joe grew up, he not only became a great businessman with a thriving business but also served as the president of the YMCA, helping countless young people. When he turned sixty, representatives from all over the world came to congratulate him. The King of England, because he benefited young people and contributed to the world, bestowed a title upon him. When he died, he was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral in London. He was the founder of the YMCA, William Joe's son also continued his ambition and is not only doing big business now but is also a great philanthropist and a key member of enthusiastic service in England. Children! Do you know Joe's savior, Jesus? Please also learn from Joe and speak to Jesus, pray to Him. Jesus is everywhere. You can't see Him, you can't hear Him, but He is God. He can see you, He can hear you. He wants to save you, help you, make you a good person, make you a useful person. (The End)

### Paper Cutouts for Dignitaries to Watch Plays

— Lu Degang

In several major theaters in Paris, France, the best seats in the front rows of the boxes are often reserved, not to be purchased by ordinary people. This is because these empty seats are specifically for the enjoyment of many important figures from England and France when they visit. However, because these dignitaries are often busy with political affairs, they don't have many opportunities to attend. The performers on stage, seeing several rows of empty seats in front of them, inevitably feel uninspired during the performance. To remedy this, people in the theater came up with the idea of cutting out many figures of famous people from paper, coloring them, and placing them in the empty seats to make them look lifelike. The performers, seeing the entire theater full, with countless distinguished guests such as King George of England, Chamberlain, Lebrun, and Gamelin, with many attendants, quietly enjoying their performance, would inevitably put in extra effort, giving it their all. It is a pity that these virtual guests are all silent. Even when the performance is excellent, they never applaud or praise, perhaps because their status is too noble!

### Heavenly Thunder's Retribution

— Xiao Tian

In Peking opera, play titles containing the word "retribution" generally imply the punishment of evil, embodying the idea that heavenly justice is clear and retribution is certain. "Heavenly Thunder's Retribution" is such a play. The story depicts Zhang Jibao returning home in glory, but ultimately the reason of his conscience could not overcome the vanity of evil, so he forced his parents, who had raised him for many years, to their deaths, and he suffered the retribution of being struck by lightning. Although the notion of being struck by lightning was dismissed as superstition and unfounded by Wang Chong in his book "Lun Heng" as far back as the Three Kingdoms period, this play absolutely cannot do without this element. We can disregard the theory and focus on the story. The play is not written from a positive perspective but is highlighted from a negative one. Therefore, the main characters are an old man and an old woman. The more deeply the old man and old woman express their longing for their son, the more it can arouse the audience's anger towards the young man's rejection of his parents. It is a poignant tragedy, a display of declining emotions, and the old man's singing is also very important, it needs to be sung with sadness and desolation, where the emotion outweighs the words, something that two skillful singers cannot accomplish alone.

I remember the first time I saw this play was at the Xin Wu Tai Theater in Nine Acres. The star was the famous Tan Xinpei. Unfortunately, I was too young to appreciate the qualities of the old Tan. I only remember on the way home, my mother asked me in the carriage, "If you become an official in the future, will you be like that young man?" I cried anxiously. Alas, my mother left me when I was a freshman in college.

Around 1930, while living in old Peking, I saw a performance of "Heavenly Thunder's Retribution" by the veteran actor Liu Jingran at the Jixiang Garden, and I also saw a collaboration between Yu Shuyan and Wang Changlin at the Zhonghe Garden. By that time, I had already studied this play because I wanted to play the musical accompaniment. Shuyan's singing style and enunciation were similar to Yan Hengzhang's, and his acting was very delicate and stylish, but he lacked a bit of the decrepit old age, seeming not quite like an old man of seventy or eighty. As for Liu Jingran, alas, all that remained was a bit of the decrepit old age.

Among amateur performers, I saw a collaboration between Wang Songchen and Zhuo Youqi once. Songchen's appearance and natural singing voice were very similar to those of old Tan. Youqi's performance was also surprisingly good. There was also a collaboration with Sheng Shoumei once. I heard that the original play scheduled for that day was "Fen He Wan," but because the main attraction was my "Woman's Escort," to avoid two Qingyi plays in a row, they temporarily changed to "Heavenly Thunder's Retribution." This virtue is very admirable. I don't know where these people have gone now.

In recent years, I have seen it twice. One was a joint performance by Ma Lianliang, Zhang Junqiu, and Ma Fulu, and the other was the recent performance by Xi Xiaobo, Hou Yulan, and Ru Fuhui at the Golden Theater, both performed in full. The "Giving Birth" scene is a major Qingyi play. Junqiu's transition to the second six phrases seems better than Yulan's. The "Recognizing Son" scene is equally important for both the male and female leads, and it is also the most exciting scene in the play. It is likely that there is an old script for it. When Ma performs this scene, his voice and appearance are both excellent, and some of the female audience members even shed tears, but Xi is also not weak. The "Longing for Son" scenes are also good. However, at the end, in the scene where the son is struck by lightning, the shaking rhythm of "Before I can speak, tears flow involuntarily" is the culmination of the entire play, and it seems that both performers are somewhat relaxed. I once heard Yan Zhang hum this, including the lines like "When the house leaks, it rains," where he didn't casually let go of even the unimportant parts, let alone the culmination of the entire play. Yulan's stage presence is better than Junqiu's, but her singing is not as good. Both are good materials. In this play, Fuhui seems more concise and lively than Fulu, probably because he is not lazy. In the "Though it wasn't me who carried you for ten months" section of the Siping aria, Wang Changlin immediately connects the recitation to the tune, which is very concise and moving, and it seems that this can be learned from.

### Wang Xichun in Hong Kong, Enters the School of Mei Lanfang

— Me

Wang Xichun from the Little Island left Shanghai to perform at the Lee Theatre in Hong Kong more than a month ago. Many people are concerned about her recent situation. The day before yesterday, I received some news about her from a friend.

It is said that for the first week of her debut, all the seated tickets were sold out in advance, with very good results. However, after that, only half of the seats were sold for each performance. This is because the people of Hong Kong are not interested in Peking Opera. Regardless of the performer, they will all receive the same result.

Her contract expired on April 2nd. Whether Jin Suqin would immediately follow up and perform from the 3rd onwards has not yet been reported. However, the supporting actors invited by Suqin are still staying in Shanghai, waiting for her instructions. Xichun will participate in a charity performance and will probably stay in Hong Kong for another half a month. Around the 15th, she can return to the Little Island. Finally, here is a piece of good news: through the introduction of a friend, Xichun has entered the school of Mei Lanfang as a female disciple. From now on, she has ascended the dragon gate, and her reputation has multiplied. It is worth congratulating the little crow on this occasion.

### Xu Xingzhi Writes Children's Play

— Haixing

Since two major illnesses, Xu Xingzhi has not been able to devote himself to theatrical work as much as before. Recently, he wrote a children's play titled "Eight Planets," using comets, Neptune, and other celestial bodies as symbolic objects of description, with special ambitions. Xu Xingzhi has always had an elegant reputation for children's plays. The children's play special in the "Da Wan Bao" newspaper and the weekly performances before the war were hosted by him.
