Although the Chinese regular army withdrew from the island before the Japanese invasion, there are currently two security regiments and many local self-defense groups cooperating with the security forces on the island. Even though the Japanese army occupies important ports, the Chinese army entrenched in the mountains regularly receives military supplies from the mainland. The Chinese army on the mainland uses sailboats to maintain transportation with Hainan Island and secretly transports weapons and supplies at night, with very satisfactory results. Therefore, Chinese merchants are now also taking risks to transport goods from the mainland, selling merchandise to the Chinese in the interior of the island, making substantial profits.

We are less knowledgeable and capable than Dr. Sun, and the current work and responsibilities are far greater than the revolutionary work of the past.

Editorial

### Commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen

On this day, the fifteenth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, we turn from admiring the wise predecessor to reflecting on everything in history, and thus to the Opium War exactly one hundred years ago. Examining the storms and waves of the past hundred years from the perspective of the Opium War reveals the profound significance of the revolution and a more concrete understanding of what is meant by "the revolution has not yet succeeded."

This hundred years, simply put, is the period of imperialism seizing colonies. We must understand history, must analyze the times: we are confident that a bright future is being created, so we are unwilling to pointlessly curse imperialism. We must be brave in self-reflection, believing that in the era of seizing colonies, China's slow-wittedness and the Qing dynasty's self-corruption made the Chinese nation a target of oppression; for a hundred years, it has been constantly subjected to oppression; at the same time, it has also been pushed by storms and rain, and has consciously and continuously strived for liberation. The Opium War in 1840, one hundred years ago, was the beginning of oppression; while in 1894, Dr. Sun Yat-sen launched the Xingzhonghui in Honolulu, which was the beginning of the struggle for liberation. Assuming that history allows for a two-part division, then in this hundred years, the period before 1894 is the first period, and the period after 1894 is the second period. In reality, it cannot be divided, because after 1894, the situation of oppression not only did not end, but the oppression reached its extreme point with the "July 7th" Incident in 1937; since the War of Resistance to the present, the liberation movement has reached a boiling point. Cutting off history? After the victory of the War of Resistance, undoubtedly the oppression will end and liberation will be realized; the old history will form a paragraph, and a new era will begin from then on!

Looking back on history, only the decadent sigh. Look at the past hundred years: the Western powers, with their military and economic power, broke through China's closed-door policy, starting with economic plunder, followed by territorial occupation and the division of vassal states; the Treaty of Nanjing opened the door; then there were the Treaty of Tianjin, the Sino-British Yantai Treaty, the Sino-French Treaty, and the Treaty of Shimonoseki. From then on, within China, the economic fortresses of the powers were scattered like stars, and the whole country became the market of the powers. As for the loss of territory, it made China's periphery completely vulnerable. If one only knows how to sigh, then these are all materials for sighing; if one is accustomed to decadence, then at that time, one was indeed on the verge of death, and being slaughtered by others, it was possible to do nothing and entrust it to fate. The ruling class at that time, after repeatedly losing power and territory, went against the trend of the times, abandoned themselves, and truly led the crowd towards decadence. National subjugation and the extermination of the race almost became a preordained fate. Not decadent, only revolution. Thus, under that atmosphere, the revolutionary forces led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen gradually rose; starting with secret societies, they then gained the widespread support of intellectuals; through advocacy and movement, they opened up a clear path for the struggle for liberation; with the Xinhai Revolution, they created the era of the Republic of China. But the revolution has not yet succeeded, and the various internal and external collusions of the counter-revolution have intensified; today, in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen passed away; after another fifteen years to this day, the various internal and external collusions of the counter-revolution have reached the stage of revealing their true colors.

Regarding the rise and fall of a nation, regarding the rise and fall of a country, there is a necessary causal relationship; and the evolution of cause and effect is by no means a natural phenomenon like "when the water comes, the canal is formed" or "when the melon is ripe, it falls off its stem." With Dr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong efforts, the Republic of China laid the revolutionary foundation; it suffered all kinds of hardships and adversities, thus enabling 450 million people across the country to accept his teachings, inherit his fighting spirit, and lay the foundation for the Chinese nation to never be destroyed by any oppression. Where oppression exists, the whole country loves an independent and free country and is happy to fight for the interests of the country. After more than thirty months of arduous struggle, the present, a moment before its success, is of course the most difficult period. During this period, the external oppression, although exhausted and at the end of its strength, has launched various offensives, multiple prongs, trying its best in its final attempts; internally, there are the jackals attached to imperialism, trying to divide the nation in many ways; but because Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and spirit have deeply penetrated people's hearts, all internal and external troubles will inevitably not be able to prevent the completion of China's nation-building. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's historical lessons over forty years prove time and again that all forces that violate the revolutionary forces will eventually gradually lose power and be eliminated one by one. The greatest obstacle to the revolutionary forces at the beginning was the deeply rooted Qing feudal forces, and soon the total area of feudal forces was eliminated: then came the widespread warlord forces, and soon the warlord forces were eliminated; as for the rebels and dropouts in the revolutionary camp, and even the deteriorating elements who borrowed the revolutionary shell, each had its own period of dominance, each had its own opportunity to be active, but they could not last long. All these historical proofs are the precedents for the future; recalling history, there is no need to fall into decadence and sigh, but it will surely increase courage, step onto the open road, and move forward vigorously.

### Overseas Chinese Representatives from Various Parts of Southern Asia Arrive in Chongqing This Month to Comfort Soldiers on All Fronts and Study Investment in the Motherland

### Japanese Monopoly of Hankou Trade

At the annual meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Mason, in his report, made a frank criticism of the Japanese monopoly of Hankou trade, stating that all kinds of goods that Japan can manufacture or foreign goods managed by the Japanese are imported. The Japanese claim that imports are limited to military necessities is no longer sustainable. Most of the imported goods come from Japan, and at a time when customs are chaotic and power is not asserted, ordinary customs procedures may not even be followed. The method of export business is also unfavorable to British merchants. The Japanese also cite military necessity for exports, but various goods are still shipped out in large quantities. Tung oil, ramie, cotton, gallnuts, cowhide, sheepskin, and eggs, tea, and general sundries are still flowing out. They are also not all shipped to Japan. As for the pure local business between the people of third countries, it is hindered by the arbitrary control of licenses. At the end of 1939, there were 127 British men, 88 women, and 25 children living in Hankou. (Reuters Hankou communication)

### The Six-Year Opium Suppression Plan Expires This Year; Opium Addicts Must Quit Within a Limited Time; The Executive Yuan Orders the Ministry of Interior to Strictly Enforce It; No Tolerance for Elderly and Chronically Ill Opium Addicts

Chongqing: The six-year opium suppression plan expires this year, and all opium addicts must quit within a limited time. However, there are rumors that there may be flexible measures for elderly and chronically ill opium addicts. It has been learned that the relevant authorities previously held a meeting to discuss the issue of improving the opium suppression policy. They all believed that since the opium suppression policy has been decided to be thoroughly implemented, elderly and chronically ill opium addicts should be dealt with strictly in the same way, and it was decided that all should be included in the list of those who must quit within a limited time. This shows that the government has made a great determination to promote the opium suppression policy, and there is no room for leniency under any circumstances. All opium addicts should understand thoroughly, quit immediately to avoid violating the law. Based on the above resolution, the Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministry of Interior to strictly enforce it, and the Ministry of Interior has complied and presented a report to abolish the supplementary rules for quitting within a limited time issued in July 1937. The Executive Yuan approved the order and notified all relevant agencies to be informed. (11th dispatch)

### The Case of American Reporter Young is Tried in Japan

Young was arrested at the Imperial Hotel on January 21. (11th Reuters dispatch)

### Key Figures in the Japanese Navy Criticize Britain and Hope for Germany's Victory

Tokyo Airmail: Rear Admiral Ishigane, former spokesman for the Ministry of the Navy, has recently published articles in the military's official newspaper, "Kokumin Shimbun," detailing the international situation. In a recent article, he launched a major attack on Britain, stating, "Although I personally do not side with Germany, nor do I hope that Britain will be defeated, it would definitely be beneficial to Japan if Germany were to win this European war. In the previous World War, Britain and Japan were allies, but after Germany's defeat, the alliance relationship was abandoned. Britain is deeply concerned about Japan's gradual strengthening and began to put pressure on Japan. As for this European war, I do not believe that Britain and France will be able to defeat Germany. However, if Britain and France do win, Britain will definitely plot against Japan. If this observation is not wrong, then I should hope that Britain will be defeated before it does evil in the Far East." As for the United States, the initial American democracy was the result of fighting against British oppression and establishing a new order. However, at this moment, it cannot understand the order that Japan wants to establish in the Far East, which is truly difficult to understand. The so-called "New Order in the Far East" also aims to eliminate oppression, but the so-called Open Door has become an outdated order. Therefore, if the United States and Japan want to avoid war, we must make the American people understand this fact." (11th Havas dispatch)

### Soviet-Japanese Negotiations Enter Final Stage: Elliptical Plane Reconnoiters Southern Sakhalin

Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated this morning at a press conference that negotiations in Moscow regarding the Manchurian border agreement proposed by Japan have reached their final stage. The Japanese government is awaiting the final response from the Soviet side. Once the treaty is signed, a border demarcation committee and a border incident arbitration committee will be established. However, the Nomonhan border is regarded as a separate issue. Fishery negotiations will begin in Moscow within days, and he hopes that a permanent fishery agreement will be realized in accordance with the promise made by the Soviet side on December 30. (Eleventh, Reuters)

Tokyo: According to news here today, at 12:40 this afternoon, a Soviet plane appeared over Japanese territory in southern Sakhalin. At 1:20, another Soviet plane appeared, intruding 80 kilometers into Japanese airspace. The Soviet plane then flew north. (Eleventh, United Press)

Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today expressed the possibility of the Soviet Union taking a sudden offensive in the Far East. Hochi Shimbun stated that since the signing of the Nomonhan ceasefire agreement, the Soviet Union has intensified its defenses in Kamchatka and completed the northern Siberian transportation line, closely connecting Moya and Shanghai Islands. The purpose of this activity is purely to enable the Soviet Union to control the northern Pacific and threaten Japan. Currently, Japan's fishing and other rights in Sakhalin Island are being infringed upon by the Soviet Union, and the completion of the Arctic Line makes the Soviet Union even more fearless of Japan. All of this indicates the nature of the Soviet Union's policy toward Japan. (Tenth, United Press)

Paris: According to news received here last night from Tokyo via Shanghai, the Soviet Union and Japan are negotiating a non-aggression pact in Moscow. This pact has serious consequences for the Far Eastern situation and will have a decisive impact on the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War. It is said that Japan is demanding that the Soviet Union cease assisting the Nationalist government and the Chinese Communist Party during the Sino-Japanese War. Japan suggests recognizing the Soviet Union's sphere of influence in Xinjiang in exchange for Soviet recognition of "Manchukuo." According to unconfirmed official sources, the Soviet Union is demanding that Japan recognize Soviet power in Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union's partition of Poland with Germany. The Soviet Union also demands that Japan agree to establish a demilitarized zone in the northern part of "Manchukuo" and abandon the management rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway up to Harbin. It is said that Japan rejected the railway proposal. Regarding economic issues, Japan proposed supplying the Soviet Union with casings, fruits, soybeans, magnesium, and sulfur in exchange for kerosene and manganese. It is said that the Soviet Union proposed giving Japan fish, sugar, and salt, but demanded new tonnage of ships from Japan in exchange for iron ore. (Eleventh, United Press)

### US Determination to Aid China Unwavering: Evidenced by New Loans, As Observed by Asahi Shimbun

Tokyo: According to the Asahi Shimbun here, "The new $20 million US loan to China further proves the unwavering US determination to aid China. The US is determined to help the Chinese government achieve final victory and stop Japanese military actions in China. In short, as Japan intensifies its efforts to promote the East Asia Construction Plan, US hostility towards Japan will become obvious. The US is both vigorously assisting the Nationalist government and expressing hostility towards Japan. This fact is extremely clear and cannot be concealed. Currently, as we are about to resolve the 'China Incident,' the US hostile attitude has become more obvious and intense. American people now believe that the Japanese economy is about to collapse, and that intensifying aid to China at this time will accelerate Japan's demise. If the US finds economic pressure insufficient, it will prepare to use naval force." (Eleventh, United Press)

### All India Congress Opposes Participation in War

Moscow: Indian reports state that British authorities intend to ban the All India Congress meeting. It is rumored that the meeting was originally scheduled to be held in Mumbai on March 15, but whether it can be held as scheduled seems uncertain. At the same time, the Soviet official news agency announced the content of the resolution to be proposed by the Indian Congress. It is said that the British government did not obtain the consent of the Indian people in advance before listing India as a belligerent group, causing peace-loving Indians to feel an intolerable insult. The motive for Britain's war is clearly to defend the rights of the British Empire, but the source of its wealth is due to the exploitation of the Indian nation and the people of other African and Asian countries. Under these circumstances, the Indian Congress cannot support Britain's war. The Indian Congress will naturally protest against Britain forcing Indian troops to fight for British interests, and the Indian Congress also opposes the export of Indian food and raw materials for war use.

### Wang Zhengting Arrives in Manila

Manila: Former Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Wang Zhengting arrived here today from Hong Kong on the "President Coolidge." According to the Doctor, his arrival here is purely to manage the affairs of the Philippine Bank of Communications. (Eleventh, United Press)

### Japan's Diplomacy Towards the US Fails: Ambassador to the US to be Replaced, Rumor of Tani Masayuki Replacing Horiuchi

Tokyo: Former special envoy to China and current Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani Masayuki will succeed Horiuchi Kensuke as the Japanese Ambassador to the United States. According to Hochi Shimbun, the Japanese government is extremely dissatisfied with Horiuchi's handling of Japanese-US diplomacy, so it decided to have Tani Masayuki succeed him. The newspaper also said, "The Japanese government is particularly dissatisfied that Horiuchi failed to notify the Japanese authorities in advance of the US government's move to abolish the commercial treaty." As for Tani Masayuki, the Japanese government originally intended to send him as ambassador to France, but due to opposition from Paris, he was first transferred to the post of Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and then to the post of Ambassador to the United States. (Eleventh, United Press)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro, when discussing Japanese-US relations, stated that Japan is currently concentrating all its efforts on clearing up the issues between the two countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is sending experts to Shanghai and other cities in China to promote the resolution of outstanding cases. At the same time, Japanese-US trade is still proceeding as usual, but we naturally want a situation to occur that makes it possible to restore the treaty situation. I believe that there will be no new conflicts between Japan and the US. I hope that the US can take the lead in initiating discussions on concluding a new treaty. (Eleventh, United Press)

Washington: According to news here today, although Japan has adopted a relatively moderate attitude towards the US in China, it is still considered unacceptable because Japan's fundamental policy towards the Far East has not changed. Japan recently promised to compensate Americans for losses incurred in China, the opening of the Suzhou Creek north of Shanghai, the proposed opening of the Yangtze River, and the reduction of conflicts between Japanese soldiers and third-country expatriates, all of which are Japanese actions to improve relations with the US, hoping that the US will no longer impose economic pressure on Japan. While officials here have welcomed these Japanese actions, US-Japanese relations cannot be greatly adjusted before Japan makes fundamental changes to its policy of establishing a "New Order in East Asia." One is that the faction in the US advocating economic sanctions against Japan is still strong, and the other is that the US cannot recognize everything that Japan has acquired by force. Therefore, unless Japan abandons its war of aggression against China, there can be no commercial cooperation. (Eleventh, United Press)

### Rumor of German and Italian Foreign Ministers Drafting Peace Plan Together: German Foreign Minister Meets Pope and Italian King, and Meets with Mussolini Again

Rome: In addition to paying homage to Pope Pius XII this morning, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also met with Italian King Victor Emmanuel III. People are very surprised because this was not on the original schedule. It is commonly said that when a foreign minister of one country visits another, it is normal for the head of that country to receive him, but the fact that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with the King today should not be taken lightly. Generally speaking, the authorities intend to take this opportunity to express that the royal family and the Fascist government hold completely consistent views on the international situation. It is learned that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Ciano at 4:30 pm and pay homage to Prime Minister Mussolini at 5:00 pm, and then depart for his country at 9:30 pm. (Eleventh, Havas)

Danjing: "The Peiping Times" recently reported that according to news from the Romanian capital, after German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived in Rome, he is drafting a peace plan with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, preparing to hand it over to US Undersecretary of State Welles when he returns to Rome, to bring it back to the United States. (Eleventh, Havas)

Milan: Italian newspapers regard German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Rome as a major political event, emphasizing that this visit is clear proof of the close relationship between the two friendly countries. "Il Popolo d'Italia" pointed out that given the importance of the current European situation, the world's attention to Ribbentrop's visit is naturally expected. The content of the discussion will be nothing more than reviewing the general situation. Rumors that Germany is asking Italy to change its non-belligerent attitude are completely fabricated. (Eleventh, Haitong)

Rome: It is widely speculated that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who is currently in Rome, must have had very secret talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano over tea yesterday. It is estimated that Ciano hosted a banquet at his residence to entertain the German Foreign Minister and continued the talks. The German Foreign Minister may depart for Berlin tonight. According to news reports, the German Foreign Minister's talks were limited to stating the German government's viewpoints, as Italy's freedom of action has been fully recognized by Germany in the talks in Salzburg and Berlin. (Eleventh, Reuters)

Rome: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, accompanied by Prince Hesse (i.e., the son-in-law of the Italian King), took a car this afternoon for a week-long trip to the suburbs, and then went to the German Embassy in Italy to meet with Ambassador Mackensen for discussions. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Ciano, and is scheduled to pay homage to Pope Pius XII at 11:00 am tomorrow, and then hold a second meeting with Prime Minister Mussolini in the afternoon, before departing for Berlin at 9:30 pm tomorrow evening.

### German Foreign Minister's Visit to Italy Initiated by the German Side

Rome: Foreign observers here have recently stated that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit was initiated by Germany, and this has now been confirmed. The goal of this trip is nothing more than to persuade Italy to accept Germany's views, especially regarding the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, while also attempting to take the opportunity to promote closer ties between the two sides. However, as of now, there is no indication that Italy is prepared to change its non-belligerent stance in the short term. On the contrary, Italy will undoubtedly decide its own fate in accordance with its own interests. In short, no changes have occurred in the European situation that would cause Italy to change its current attitude. However, the result of the talks between Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Prime Minister Mussolini may be the signing of a new diplomatic document to determine each other's positions in various situations. In essence, it is used to determine the mutual positions that Germany and Italy should take when the war expands to Scandinavia, the Balkans, or the Near and Middle East. At the same time, or even to establish a new economic agreement to deal with the blockade policy of Britain and France. Aside from this, Germany is also working hard to bring Italy and the Soviet Union together, hoping that the countries will resume trade so that the Soviet Union can openly take the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea when supplying Germany with goods in the future. This issue is also one of the goals of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit. (Tenth, Havas)

### Montell Writes Article Explaining German Viewpoint

Swiss Capital: Montell, the personal secretary of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, recently published an article in a local German-language newspaper, explaining Germany's views on Italy's non-belligerent stance. This article is noteworthy because it was written while Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was visiting Italy. It said, "Fascist Italy is already on the same front as National Socialist Germany in spirit. Once the time is ripe, Italy should be realistic and take action. At that time, the enemies of the new Europe will definitely feel troubled. In short, Germany now intends to explain to Italy that Germany's alliance with the Soviet Union is also beneficial to Italy's interests. The raw materials that Germany obtains from the Soviet Union can also be equally convenient for Italy. In addition, Italy is located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, like a 'prisoner,' and should redistribute the colonies around the sea as soon as possible. For the sake of its own interests, Italy should abandon its neutral policy and take practical action." (Eleventh, Havas)

### Welles Declares No Suggestions on European Situation: Visited Halifax Yesterday Afternoon

London: US Undersecretary of State Welles said to reporters at the US Embassy this afternoon that he has no proposals and no responsibilities. Welles was amused by his own silence when answering questions from more than a hundred reporters. Welles solemnly declared (1) that his trip to Europe was to find facts so that he could report to President Roosevelt, and (2) that any opinions expressed to him by government officials of various countries will be kept absolutely confidential and will only be reported to President Roosevelt. When a reporter asked if it was true that Welles had said in Paris that the Allies would have some difficulties defeating Germany, Welles replied that he solemnly declared that he had not expressed any opinion on the trip to friends or non-friends anywhere. As for whether his report will be published, it will depend entirely on President Roosevelt, Welles also said that he plans to leave London on Thursday, travel through Paris to Rome to meet with Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano again, and return to the country from Naples on March 18 or 19. He gave the French Minister of Finance a memorandum on US economic policy, which was also delivered to the governments of other countries he visited, Welles will visit British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Minister Halifax this afternoon, and meet with the British King, and have dinner with the British Foreign Minister in the evening.

### Yan Huiqing Talks About Sino-Japanese Issues

Manila: Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chief Chinese representative attending the Pacific Relations Conference, arrived here today, accompanied by his secretary Dr. Wei, his niece Miss Yan, and another representative attending the Pacific Relations Conference, Mr. Chen, According to Yan, the result of China's resistance war has greatly weakened Japan's economic position, and its national debt has more than doubled in the past two years. He also said that China's unity and solidarity in this arduous resistance war is unprecedented in Chinese history, China has made full preparations for the future of the war and will surely achieve a victorious result, When talking about Wang Jingwei's "new organization," Yan believed that it was insignificant, Yan also reported the results of attending the US conference at the Pacific Relations Branch in the city today, stating that it was a pity that Japan, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands did not send representatives during the conference. When discussing Japan's goals in China, people generally believed that obtaining economic markets and raw materials was a secondary goal, and that its primary goal was to suppress China. The conference did not believe in the Japanese claim that the fundamental reason for Japan's policy was that China had a tendency to communism. Many speakers at the conference believed that Japan's goal of control was the first step in its conquest of the entire Asia. Japan's legitimate rights and interests in China and its opportunities to trade with China were generally considered to be unthreatened. Fourth, China will not be used by others as a place to attack Japan. Furthermore, reviewing Japan's lack of goals, none of them cannot be achieved in the form of commercial treaties or the conclusion of non-aggression treaties. Regarding the adjustment of Japan's post-war economy, people generally believed that it was closely related to China's post-war reconstruction. In other words, it is not impossible for Japan to restore its pre-war prosperity in trade with China. Therefore, the conference believed that the difficulty in Sino-Japanese relations was not due to any grievances suffered by the Japanese economy, but to the result of its implementation of the continental policy. Therefore, unless the Japanese warlords can be restrained by the civil government faction, the hope of establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between China and Japan is very slim.

### Japanese Barber Extravagantly Talks About National Affairs: The Success or Failure of the Yonai Cabinet Depends on the Rice and Coal Problem

Tokyo: The famous Japanese monthly magazine "Humorous Club" recently solicited impressions from the general public on the current state of the country, especially on various commodity restriction regulations. The person in charge is Abe, the editor of "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun," who is known as an outspoken political commentator. At that time, he was chatting with a barber, who said that "the Japanese people are now silently obeying government orders, but it is undeniable that their lives are becoming more and more difficult. On the other hand, there are many people who spend money like water. With such contradictions, how can the world hope for peace and tranquility? I cannot do anything about this situation, and I believe that the Japanese public shares the same sentiment. Prince Konoe was in office as Prime Minister when the 'China Incident' broke out, so he cannot easily shirk his responsibility. He will definitely come to power again in the future to resolve this incident. As for party politics, I am in favor of it. Among the people in various parties, there are far-sighted people and talented people who have experienced many hardships and have high moral character, which is what Japan needs. I hope that the current bureaucratic politics can also produce the same kind of people. The Yonai Cabinet has recruited more party figures than the previous cabinet, which is a welcome phenomenon." The barber bowed to Abe after saying this, and turned his attention to foreign policy, He had four points to make: "If Japan's attitude is firm, everything will definitely go smoothly." The barber talked a lot about national affairs, and although he elaborated on many points, what he was most concerned about was rice and coal and their market prices. He said, "The success or failure of the Yonai Cabinet depends on its ability to solve the rice and coal problem, Because price fluctuations are where the current cabinet's fate lies." The barber sighed for a long time, bowed to Abe again to say goodbye, and urged Abe, "If there is no solution to this problem, then no matter what kind of long-term recovery plan, it will be nothing more than empty talk, and it will not be possible to achieve." According to the reporter, it is impossible to verify who the barber is or whether he is a fictional character created by Abe. (Eleventh, Havas)

### Chamberlain Explains in the House of Commons the Reasons for Releasing Italian Ships, Saying That the Italian Ships Carrying Coal Were Due to a Misunderstanding

London: During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain answered a question from a member of parliament, saying that "regarding the detention of Italian ships carrying German coal, the government reached an agreement with Italy on the ninth of this month, which is gratifying. The government had previously announced that it would implement inspections of coal coming from Germany from the first of this month, but many Italian ships still carried coal back to the country after this deadline. It has now been found that this move by Italy was due to a misunderstanding, so our country decided to release the detained Italian ships as usual, In the Italian government, it should promise not to send ships to Dutch ports to transport German coal in the future, and those already in those ports should load ballast cargo and leave." At this point, opposition Labor Party member Thornie asked whether the government had taken various measures to supply Italy with more coal, The Prime Minister replied that this issue would be discussed by both parties, without a doubt.

### Preliminary Stage of Soviet-Finnish Peace Negotiations Concluded; Finnish Representatives Leave Moscow to Return Home; Parliament to Meet Tonight to Discuss

Helsinki: The preliminary stage of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations has come to an end. The Finnish Prime Minister led the representatives who came with him and set off to return home. They will arrive in Helsinki tomorrow. The Finnish Parliament may hold a meeting tomorrow night to discuss the matter. According to informed sources, the Soviet Union has abandoned its demand for the cession of Hanko and replaced it with the cession of Örö Island, which is located between the Åland Islands and Hanko, in the Gulf of Finland, and can be a valuable military base. However, the Soviet Union's demands, in general, do not seem to be absolutely unacceptable to Finland. However, it is not yet clear how the Soviet government views Mr. Kuusinen, the president of the "Finnish People's Government." (Haitong Telegram, 11th)

Helsinki: A public statement was released here last night, breaking the official silence regarding the Soviet-Finnish peace talks. It is said that the governments of the Soviet Union and Finland made contact a few days ago through the mediation of the Swedish government, with the aim of studying the possibility of reconciliation. Both sides recognized the benefits of direct talks. The Soviet government invited representatives of the Finnish government to go to Moscow for discussions. The Finnish delegation, composed of Mr. Ryti (Prime Minister), Mr. Paasikivi (Minister Without Portfolio), General Walden, and member of parliament Mr. Voionmaa, set off for Moscow on the evening of the 6th and has met with representatives of the Soviet government two or three times and recorded the Soviet side's peace conditions. The Finnish side has not yet made a decision. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

Helsinki: Those in charge stated that the territorial demands put forward by the Soviet Union included the Finnish part of the Rybachy Peninsula in the north, the islands in the Gulf of Finland, and demanded that Björkö Island and Hanko Island be used as Soviet naval bases. As for the selection of Finnish representatives sent to Moscow, it has in fact included representatives of all major political parties, such as Prime Minister Ryti, leader of the Progressive Party, Minister Without Portfolio Paasikivi, leader of the Conservative Party, Voionmaa, representative of the Social Democratic Party, and General Walden, a friend of Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Mannerheim, is also a representative, which is particularly noteworthy. However, although Prime Minister Ryti is personally a representative, the delegation has no power to make any decisions regarding the Soviet conditions and must still be decided by Parliament. (Havas Telegram, 11th)

Helsinki: Well-informed sources in Finland announced Finland's attitude as follows: Finland declared that it is always prepared to make peace that does not hinder its independence and is reasonable, but if unacceptable and dishonorable conditions are put forward, it would rather continue to fight to the end. Finland wants to live a peaceful life in peace, but Finland's qualifications, in considering foreign aid, to make a final decision, when the country is in a dangerous situation and struggling to survive, should first be loyal to itself and not become a tool for consultations that are beneficial to foreign countries. What is acceptable to Finland and the Soviet Union, and what Finland can sacrifice, shall be decided by Finland itself, and its decision must be based solely on its own interests. According to the opinions of the general public here, the Soviet-Finnish talks are coming to an end, and the result will be announced after the talks are over. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

Rome: A radio station here announced last night that the temporary basis for a Soviet-Finnish agreement has been established. Finnish Prime Minister Ryti is on his way to Moscow, and key negotiations are currently underway in Moscow. The temporary understanding will not impose too great a sacrifice on the Finns. Although the Finns are willing to lose the Karelian Isthmus and Petsamo, they remain firmly opposed to the issues of Hanko and the northern area of Lake Ladoga, and the Soviet side is also unwilling to give in on these two points. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

Stockholm: More details about the Soviet-Finnish peace talks are now available. About ten days ago, when the Soviet army suddenly entered the Karelian Isthmus very rapidly, there was a suggestion that the time for a ceasefire was now ripe, which was conveyed to both sides by Mr. Erkko, the former Finnish Foreign Minister, who was then in Stockholm, and the Swedish legation in Moscow. The Soviet side refused a ceasefire but agreed to meet a Finnish delegation. So the Finnish delegation flew to Stockholm and then to Moscow. It is widely believed that the deadline for peace negotiations will expire on the 12th of this month. At the same time, it is heard that Finland and the Allied governments are currently in contact to increase aid to Finland if necessary. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

Helsinki: The Finnish radio station broadcast to the Soviet people in Russian this evening, stating, "The freedom and true democracy that our country possesses are extremely cherished by our people. The people are all loyal to the government and are determined to sacrifice to defend the motherland." (Havas Telegram, 10th)

Stockholm: A statement issued here declared that the people of Finland and Sweden have not yet learned the content of the reported Soviet-Finnish peace terms. The recent Nichter Report published the emotions of most Swedish people, saying that any perfunctory peace is empty, and if Finland is defeated, it will be our turn. Even if what we encounter is not in the form of attack and annihilation, we will also be under the "protection" of a certain great power. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

### Content of Conditions Proposed by the Soviet Union to Finland: Cession, Occupation, Lease of Hanko Island

London: Reuters has learned that the Soviet Union's peace terms for ending the war with Finland will be announced on February 22. On that day, Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky visited British Undersecretary of State Butler. At the same time, Moscow also contacted Sweden about this matter. It is heard that the Soviet ambassador presented the same conditions that were submitted to Sweden, asking Britain to forward them to Finland. It is rumored that these conditions include: (1) Finland ceding the Lake Ladoga area, including Vyborg and other cities, the entire Karelian Isthmus, all the islands in the Gulf of Finland currently occupied by the Soviet army, and the western half of the Rybachy Peninsula; (2) Leasing Hanko Island as a Soviet naval base, but not limited to the duration of the European war as rumored. The British government considered the conditions to be too harsh and refused to forward them. However, a few days later, the British government informed Finland of the Soviet Union's contact regarding peace talks but did not announce the conditions it had proposed. At the same time, the Soviet Union made the same contact with Sweden. In fact, Sweden forwarded all the conditions to Finland and urged it to consider them. It is not known whether Sweden was aware of Britain's refusal when it accepted this commission to forward. Those in charge have denied rumors that if the Allies actively aid Finland, Sweden has agreed to transport military supplies and troops. It is heard that although the Allies have indicated to Sweden that if it can provide transportation convenience, the Allies are willing to increase their aid to Finland, the Swedish side has not shown any change in its attitude.

### Soviet Offensive Against Finland Still Strong; Moscow Communiqué Continues to Occupy Towns

Helsinki: Although the Soviets and Finns are now engaged in peace talks, at the end of the week, the Soviet army still exerted strong pressure on the Finnish army and launched fierce attacks in many places, desperately trying to expand its foothold on the west coast of Vyborg. However, according to the Finnish communiqué last night, the Soviet army's attempts to expand its front line have not yet succeeded. Soviet new troops, attempting to advance across the water on sleds, were heavily bombed by Finnish aircraft, suffering more than half casualties. Northeast of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet army attacked along the coast near Uoma, and fierce fighting broke out in the territory of Kollaanjoki. The Soviet army's attacks on this line were repelled. In the past two days, 2,000 Soviet soldiers have been killed. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

Moscow: The Soviet military authorities issued a war report last night, declaring that there were no major battles yesterday. The Soviet army occupied Vaga-Ri Island and Nisaratti village west of Vyborg Bay. On the Lake Ladoga front, the Soviet army occupied Varattsu Island. The Soviet Air Force was unusually active yesterday, bombing enemy positions and shooting down eight enemy aircraft. (TASS Telegram, 11th)

Moscow: The communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District stated that there were still no major developments on the front line yesterday. Soviet troops occupied Vanchosari Island in Vyborg Bay, Nisharatti Town on the west coast of Vyborg Bay, Volrazu Island in Lake Ladoga. There was also intense activity between reconnaissance teams on the Laumaa road on the Ikaavisa-Duborg railway. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets. In air combat, the Soviet Air Force also shot down eight enemy aircraft. (TASS Telegram, 11th)

Moscow: On the occasion of Molotov's 50th birthday, the Leningrad Military District Committee sent a telegram to Molotov, stating, "The Soviet government has entrusted the officers and soldiers of the Leningrad District with the glorious task of ordering us to eliminate the most dangerous war base against our motherland, so as to protect the safety of Leningrad. We vow to complete this task with the greatest effort." (TASS Telegram, 10th)

### Sweden and Finland to Conclude Defense Alliance: Predictions from Danish Newspapers

Copenhagen: The Danish Politiken's correspondent in Stockholm today predicted that Sweden will conclude a defense alliance with Finland, or that Sweden, Norway, and Finland will jointly form an alliance. If a peaceful order is restored and the Soviet Union makes demands on Finland again or launches an attack, the provisions of the defense alliance will take effect. In any case, if the Soviet Union attacks Finland again after the peace agreement, Sweden will definitely have a strong reaction, or the Swedish government has already expressed this intention to the Finnish government, which is why the Finnish government is willing to send representatives to negotiate peace with the Soviet Union this time. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 11th)

### US Has Not Closed the Door to Mediation in Soviet-Finnish Dispute; Newspapers Believe Finland's Fate is Related to Britain and France; US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Continues to Visit Molotov

Washington: Today, officials here declared that the door to US mediation of the Soviet-Finnish war, which opened on November 30 last year, remains open. Therefore, in form, the Soviet Union only needs to announce its acceptance of the US proposal, and it seems that it can discuss with the mediator sent by the US. However, according to the most reliable sources, it is believed that there are many branches in the Soviet-Finnish war, making the US's "mediation" very difficult and with little hope of success. On Friday evening last week, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov for two hours, so the general public believes that Steinhardt may have made some hints to Molotov. According to diplomatic circles here, the US attitude is as follows: "The US sighs deeply at the widening and deepening war zone. The US does not judge who is right and who is wrong on both sides, but only hopes to resolve the dispute through peaceful methods. Therefore, if both sides can agree to US mediation, the US will be happy to serve." At the same time, Secretary of State Hull repeatedly stated that neither side has given a request for mediation to the US by Steinhardt or others. Therefore, it can be known that the progress or abandonment of reconciliation depends on Roosevelt. White House spokesman Early said that the door for the US to come forward to mediate has not been closed by President Roosevelt, nor has it been opened by him. Early did not comment on the meeting between Molotov and Steinhardt, but most diplomatic circles here believe that the reason why Moscow suddenly showed intimacy to the US minister is not that the Soviet Union is preparing to request mediation from the US, but that the US economic sanctions are making the Soviet Union extremely anxious. It is heard that Congress recently intends to pass a resolution to cancel Ambassador Steinhardt's salary, thereby severing US-Soviet relations. Moscow was greatly shocked to learn of this. The Soviet Union deeply fears that the US moral sanctions will extend to copper and machinery. It is heard that the Allied side is now urgently requesting the US to realize this step. (International News Agency Telegram, 11th)

New York: The peace talks between Finland and the Soviet Union have recently been commented on by various newspapers, which said that Finland's fate is closely related to Britain and France. The New York Times wrote, "The future of the Soviet-Finnish peace situation must be one of the following two paths: either Finland is forced to make peace with the Soviet Union, or the scope of the Soviet-Finnish war expands as a result, to other countries, or even merges with the current war in Western Europe." The New York Hearld Tribune wrote, "A peace that is unfavorable to Finland, if it is established, the prestige of Britain and France will be hit." In addition, regarding the visit of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Rome, the New York Times wrote, "The content of Ribbentrop's talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is unknown to us, but after Britain and Italy reached an agreement on coal, Ribbentrop has already lost the opportunity." (Havas Telegram, 11th)

Moscow: After the Finnish delegation arrived here to negotiate truce terms with the Soviet government, diplomatic circles here were extremely active. The Soviet authorities kept silent about the news of the Finnish representatives arriving in Moscow. Ambassadors and ministers from various countries here met with the US ambassador to the Soviet Union yesterday. The US ambassador then visited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov. The content of the talks was not announced. The US State Department in Washington announced last night that the US ambassador has "no connection" with the Soviet-Finnish negotiations.

### British Prime Minister States in the House of Commons: Continued Aid to Finland; Oslo Convention Countries Reject Passage of British and French Troops

London: When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Major Attlee, leader of the opposition Labour Party, asked whether the Prime Minister could submit a report to the House regarding the peace talks between Finland and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that the British and French governments have previously assisted Finland and will continue to do so in the future. This assistance is of great value to the country's combat power. Not only that, Britain and France have also notified the Finnish government that regarding the country's call for continued assistance, Britain and France are prepared to immediately unite and provide as much assistance as possible. (Havas Telegram, 11th)

Copenhagen: According to information received by relevant parties here, the British and French governments have recently instructed their diplomatic representatives in Finland to incite Finnish military generals to oppose peace talks with the Soviet Union. It is learned that the Allies have provided Finland with guarantees that once they obtain the right of passage through Sweden and Norway, the Allied expeditionary force will be able to enter the country in response to Finland's call. However, political figures here believe that this attempt is bound to fail. Regarding the right of Allied troops to pass through Sweden and Norway, it can be based on Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, but the countries of the Oslo Convention have stated that they are not bound by that provision. Therefore, Danish political figures hope that the peace talks currently underway in Moscow will achieve concrete results within 48 hours. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 11th)

### Allies to Withdraw from Northern European Diplomatic Activities

Geneva: League of Nations personnel, returning here from Paris, spoke to reporters about the dynamics of political circles in Paris, stating that since the news of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Rome reached Paris, all parties were deeply convinced that the Soviet-Finnish war would be settled by the Axis countries and the Soviet Union, and the Allies would completely withdraw from Northern European diplomatic activities. Daladier's policy of reconciliation with Italy has not been effective, as Italy still maintains its Axis policy. When neutral observers inquired with the French Foreign Ministry about France's attitude towards the Soviet-Finnish peace talks, they learned that Britain and France have stationed troops in the Near East to prevent Soviet "expansion." The Allies are about to compensate for the failure in Northern Europe with actions in the Near East. French figures are quite concerned that the Finnish war will end before the Allies form a "Northern European Front." The general view is that since the Allies have no certainty about the Finnish war, they should not have expressed concern from the beginning. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 10th)

### Norwegian Prime Minister Declares: Exert All Efforts to Maintain Neutrality; Leader of Swedish People's Party Delivers Speech: Says Self-Questioning Attitude Toward Finland is Without Shame

Oslo: Prime Minister Nygaardsvold recently delivered a speech at the News Reporters Association, stating, "Neutrality must be complete and flawless. It is a necessary condition for Norway to live in peace with other countries and have mutual understanding. All disputes between our country and other countries should be resolved through negotiation. The current neutrality policy is based on this point of view. In short, our country must implement a policy that does not allow others to use excuses to trap us in war disputes. We treat the disputes between Finland and the Soviet Union, or other disputes, with the same attitude. At this time when the international situation is extremely serious, all countries that desire to maintain neutrality feel that the future is bleak. We can only do our best to maintain neutrality and a glorious peace." (Havas Telegram, 10th)

Stockholm: Mr. Seths-Destron, the leader of the People's Party in the House of Representatives, recently delivered a speech, vehemently refuting the accusations made by foreign newspapers against Sweden, stating, "The actions taken by our government have the support of the Parliament, and their intention is to prevent the war between Britain, France, and Germany, and the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, from expanding in scope, so that the Scandinavian Peninsula does not become a battlefield. However, certain newspapers and radio stations are now conducting propaganda, attacking Sweden's attitude towards Finland. The wording is extremely unfair and constitutes unwarranted slander. Our country's responsibility lies in protesting in strong terms. It should be known that our country has already done a lot for Finland. Our government authorities have been able to handle various delicate issues with care and appropriateness. Self-questioning, we can be without shame. To this day, Finland must take responsibility. If the current peace talks can achieve some result that is acceptable to Finland, then even if the country has to endure major sacrifices, its heroic resistance will not have been in vain." (Havas Telegram, 10th)

### British Bomber Squadron Reconnoiters Austria and Czechoslovakia

London: The Air Ministry has recently announced, "Our bomber squadron flew to Vienna, Prague, and other cities on the night of the 9th to conduct reconnaissance and distribute leaflets, which was quite successful. When passing through Munich, Linz, Munich, Nuremberg, and other cities along the way, they made low-altitude flights and did not encounter enemy resistance." It should be noted that the first time British aircraft flew over Vienna and Prague was on January 12 of this year. Subsequently, they repeatedly flew to the province of Austria and the province of Bohemia on February 22 and 23 to distribute leaflets, but the longest voyage was the flight to Poland on the 8th of this month. In addition, British aircraft flew to Berlin to distribute leaflets a total of six times from the 26th of last month to the 2nd of this month. (Havas Telegram, 10th)

### Saito Incident Reflects Internal Contradictions in Japan: Commentary by Soviet Pravda

Moscow: Pravda today commented on the Saito incident, stating, "Saito's speech reflects the lack of struggle within Japan regarding the resolution of the so-called 'China Incident.'" "The Kokumin Shimbun claims that 'Saito represents the Japanese liberal faction and expresses the demands of that faction.'" In fact, this so-called "liberal faction" does not oppose the enslavement of China. However, the events of the past two and a half years (such as the increasing strength of the heroic Chinese people, the deteriorating Japanese economy and finance, and internal dissatisfaction in Japan) have made them doubt the Japanese military's "New Order in East Asia" plan. They deeply fear that the prolongation of the war will lead to the complete collapse of Japan and the loss of the benefits already obtained in China. Therefore, the "liberal faction" currently supports the implementation of a "minimum plan," which involves obtaining some territory from China, while reaching an understanding with Britain and the United States regarding other Chinese territories. Japan is now exhausted and urgently needs a breather before launching a large-scale operation to realize the "maximum plan." In short, although the Japanese ruling class is divided into radical and moderate factions, their ultimate goal is to enslave China. The Saito incident has fully demonstrated the seriousness of the domestic political situation in Japan." (Tass dispatch, 10th)

### Today Marks the Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Death; Citizens' Resolve to Resist and Rebuild Strengthened; City Flies Flags at Half-Mast to Express Profound Sorrow; Municipal Party Headquarters Encourages Compatriots to Overcome Difficulties

Today marks the 15th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. All sectors of the city are flying flags at half-mast and have voluntarily suspended entertainment and banquets to express profound sorrow. Government agencies, public organizations, and schools are closed as usual. Due to the special circumstances, in addition to holding separate commemorations in schools and elaborating on Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary history, no extravagant commemorative ceremonies are being held. However, all sectors commemorate Sun Yat-sen's lifelong dedication to revolution and his arduous and extraordinary efforts, the purpose of which was to seek freedom and equality for China. Now, facing unprecedented national crisis, and with resistance and reconstruction awaiting final efforts, we are determined to inherit his legacy, support national policies, save the nation from danger, and carry forward the national foundation created by Sun Yat-sen. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang issued a message to the citizens on the 15th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, urging them to emulate Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit and overcome difficulties. The authorities of the two concessions have taken strict preventive measures today to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. Details are as follows:

Message to the Public: Yesterday, all groups and shops in the city received a message to all citizens from the Shanghai Special Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang on the 15th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. The original text is as follows: "Dear citizens of the city, every sentient, thinking, feeling, and tearful person will never forget this sorrowful and solemn anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. Especially today, after two years and six months of resistance, a deeper grief and indignation must fill everyone's heart. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong work and goal was to wrest China back from the hands of the Manchu autocracy and, ultimately, to save it from the hands of imperialism. Starting from scratch, he struggled for more than 40 years, even in the last few minutes of his life, with only a breath remaining, he constantly gasped out the call to 'Save China!' As we commemorate today and reflect on that time, how can we not be moved to tears, transformed from decadence to excitement, from sorrow to passion, and embark on the path of resistance and national reconstruction with greater courage and determination? The Chinese nation is now facing unprecedented disasters, and the history of the Chinese nation is suffering unprecedented pain. If Sun Yat-sen were still alive, he would certainly lead us more firmly to resist the war to the end, until territorial sovereignty is complete and independent. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong struggle goal was to 'Save China,' to seek international equality externally, and he would never compromise or surrender to the enemies who ravage China's territory and enslave China, and he would certainly not be softened. Resistance is precisely following Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and resistance is a continuation of the National Revolution, a process of striving for national independence and freedom. Everyone who commemorates Sun Yat-sen should firmly grasp this belief and know that completing Sun Yat-sen's legacy is the best way to commemorate him. Sun Yat-sen loved peace, but not a humiliating peace. Sun Yat-sen's life was filled with the spirit of struggle, and he sought true peace through struggle, and only peace gained through struggle. We acknowledge that Japan has accumulated national strength for decades, and we acknowledge that Japan has been plotting to invade China for decades. However, our resistance has finally been launched, and we firmly believe that resistance will achieve final victory. The basis of our belief is very simple, because this is the same reason why Sun Yat-sen, without any support at the beginning, advocated revolution and ultimately overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China. What Sun Yat-sen relied on to succeed was his leadership ability, fighting spirit, firm belief, clear ideology, the background of the times, and the support and sympathy of the whole people. What resistance relies on to win is, in addition to fully inheriting Sun Yat-sen's founding scale, also adding two unparalleled superior conditions: the vast territory and endless treasures left by the ancestors who worked hard to create it. If we doubt the future of resistance, it is tantamount to denying Sun Yat-sen's history of founding the nation. Those who really have such doubts are either stupid or delusional, and they must have a thorough reflection on this day of commemorating Sun Yat-sen's death. Dear citizens, the future of resistance is absolutely bright. However, the closer we get to victory, the more difficult it will be. Only by adhering to Sun Yat-sen's teachings and emulating Sun Yat-sen's spirit can we eliminate all obstacles and overcome any difficulties."

The Society for Honesty and Shame Respectfully Informs Compatriots:

The Honesty and Shame Movement Committee of all sectors of the city has written to respectfully inform all compatriots. The following is the same as Feng: "The 12th of this month is the 15th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. On this day last year, President Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the whole country, issued the Outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization, and asked compatriots across the country to commemorate from the practice of doctrine, and it was scheduled to begin uniformly across the country on May 1 last year, which is of profound significance for the future of resistance and national construction. Although Sun Yat-sen left us early, the great revolutionary cause he left behind requires 450 million people to work together to complete it. In the past three years, the whole country, from top to bottom, has been making enthusiastic and arduous struggles towards the common goal of national supremacy, ethnic supremacy, military first, and victory first, so that the day when the War of Resistance wins glorious victory will also be the time when the people will enjoy peace and happiness forever, which is enough to comfort Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven. However, in the excited mood of commemorating Sun Yat-sen, we should understand that the success or failure of the War of Resistance, the progress or regression of politics, economy, and culture, are all based on the revolutionary enthusiasm or fear. Only every member of the nation possesses a great revolutionary spirit can they have abundant enthusiasm, firm faith, and move forward to overcome difficulties to achieve the ultimate goal. At present, it is the most important stage of resistance and also the most arduous and dangerous stage because the aggressors have completely failed in their strategic offensive, and when they are exhausted and unable to end the war against China, they have to adopt military adventurous policies to cooperate with their political conspiracies. In this stage, to grasp the key to final victory, we must strengthen material construction, expand the military building movement, enrich weapons and equipment, improve combat technology, and promote the implementation of constitutional government. But what is especially important is that compatriots across the country can consciously and spontaneously transform themselves spiritually and transform their entire lives, destroy all selfish and self-interested thoughts, as well as the evil habits of complacency and romanticism. At the same time, under the common belief of the Three People's Principles, we must give play to this powerful revolutionary spirit and focus on the work of resistance and national construction, 'complete the great cause of national rejuvenation with the determination to die.' From today onwards, we must examine ourselves without mercy, whether there are still places of extravagance and corruption in the new life, whether we have not done our best for the society and the country, whether we are still not serious and nervous in our work, and whether we still have doubts and shakes about the belief in the victory of resistance. If there are any deficiencies, we should correct them immediately. The road ahead is very clear, either strive for victory or be willing to perish, either be a citizen of a free and independent new China or be a slave under the bayonets and whips of the invaders. Glory or shame depends on whether our minds are enthusiastic and whether our doctrine is put into practice."

Leaflets Flying Again: The Youth Writing Association of this city has launched a competition for submissions to commemorate the death of Sun Yat-sen. The topic is "Peace, Struggle, Save China." It hopes that young writers in the city will actively contribute. Submission documents should be sent to P.O. Box 1254, Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury. At the same time, yesterday on the roof of the Sun Sun Department Store on Nanjing Road, when the road was busy with traffic and pedestrians, a large number of five-color small leaflets were distributed, including (1) To commemorate Sun Yat-sen's death, we must be brave warriors who die for resistance, not obedient people who are slaughtered by the enemy, (2) What China needs is a glorious peace, not a humiliating peace, (3) To commemorate Sun Yat-sen's death, we must inherit Sun Yat-sen's and the martyrs' legacy and carry it forward, (4) In this period of scorched earth resistance, we would rather be shattered jade than intact tiles, (5) The whole nation should strive to save the country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, etc. The names were all printed and distributed by the Loyal Comrades League of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League.

### Over 100,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; More Large Batches Will Arrive Later; Over 10,000 Bales of American Cotton Will Arrive Soon; Controlled Price Sales Suspended for Five Days

A large amount of foreign rice and American cotton arrived in Shanghai. The Java Mail Steamship Company's ship, the Tjisaroea, which was sent to Saigon last month to load rice for Shanghai, arrived in port at about 3:00 p.m. yesterday and docked at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf in Hongkou, carrying over 79,000 bags. The Taikoo Company's Kwangtung Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 4,668 bags of foreign rice from Siam, and 6,322 bags from Hong Kong. Also, the Jardine Matheson Company's ship, the Mingsheng Wheel, arrived from Hong Kong with 12,675 bags. A total of 100,265 bags of foreign rice arrived yesterday, a huge amount. More large batches are coming later. It is reported that over 16,000 bales of American cotton are being transported by the American President Company's new manager's ship, the Volunteer, which loaded in San Francisco and is expected to arrive in Shanghai last night. At the latest, it should be able to enter the port this morning and is scheduled to dock at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf in Hongkou to unload.

Controlled Price Rice Shops Are Replaced

Since February 21, the Shanghai Controlled Price Committee entrusted 80 rice shops that are members of the Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association to handle controlled price sales, which has greatly benefited the poor. Now, with the approval of the Rice Shop Industry Association's request, the controlled price sales will be suspended from March 14 to 18 (five days) to replace the rice shops handling the controlled price sales. A special letter was sent to the two police departments of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession yesterday, stating, "We are writing to inform you that the Rice Shop Industry Association intends to replace the rice shops selling controlled price rice in order to give everyone a break. It is scheduled to be temporarily suspended from the 14th to the 18th of this month for five days to handle the handover. The controlled price sales will resume on the 19th. We are writing to inform you specifically, and we hope you will check it. Also, the names of the shops selling rice that have been replaced will be sent in a separate list after they are determined."

The Association Urges Payment of Controlled Price Donations

The Rice Shop Industry Association has informed all rice shops that the amount of donations to the Controlled Price Committee that have not been paid is not small. If the delay continues, it will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Controlled Price Committee. The rice grains of the Saigon broken rice in this controlled price sale are larger than those in the first phase, and the quality is also better. In recent days, many residents from Pudong and Zhabei have gone to the controlled price rice shops in the central areas to buy controlled price rice, and the controlled price rice shops have started selling early to avoid crowding.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Control Prices: Preliminary Implementation Soon; Close Cooperation with the French Concession; Retail Prices to Be Set Immediately; Ministry of Economic Affairs Promulgates Regulations for Fair Price Purchasing and Sales Offices

Regarding the control of prices in the Public Concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council has recently organized a sub-committee to study appropriate measures based on the methods announced by the French Concession authorities. It is learned that the sub-committee has drafted a preliminary report and submitted it to the Council for review and adoption. The report states that, according to the committee's research, the root cause of rising prices (especially rice, wheat, fish, and meat, followed by vegetables) is that this city has been in chaos since August 1937. At the same time, the various places that supply the needs of this city are under military control, and farmers and transportation merchants cannot trade freely. Therefore, prices in the two concessions have to be higher than usual. The authorities of the two concessions attach great importance to the current situation and are now trying to improve it.

Control Objectives

The committee has also studied the situation of exchange rate contraction and the increase in water transport costs. At the same time, it believes that there is indeed hoarding, speculation, and manipulation of certain items. If the concession authorities do not take control measures, the situation will inevitably deteriorate. Regarding this level, the Municipal Council should cooperate closely with the French Concession authorities in order to be consistent and avoid division (according to this is a consistent policy of the Council). For the sake of public welfare, appropriate retail prices should be set immediately. This matter should be put into practice and announced after investigating business conditions and other related issues.

Steps to Be Taken

Regarding what steps should be taken, the committee has studied the power of the Council, and has also considered all relevant facts, and advocates that several appropriate preliminary measures should be taken immediately to deal with this difficult and complicated problem. The committee will continue to provide reports thereafter. Finally, the committee is well aware that the Council has no intention of interfering with legitimate business operations of merchants and restricting their reasonable interests. However, in the current situation, in terms of the surge in concession residents, the Council should implement it immediately.

Regulations for Fair Price Purchasing and Sales Offices

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in view of the soaring prices affecting people's livelihood, in addition to cracking down on hoarding and speculation, in order to suppress prices, has ordered the Chambers of Commerce in various places to organize fair price purchasing and sales offices, and has promulgated 13 articles of the organization regulations. The regulations are recorded as follows: Article 1: These regulations are formulated in accordance with Article 3 of the Regulations on Fair Price Purchasing and Sales of Daily Necessities. Article 2: The scope of business of the Fair Price Purchasing and Sales Office shall be limited to the matters stipulated in the Regulations on Fair Price Purchasing and Sales of Daily Necessities and other related matters. Article 3: The Fair Price Purchasing and Sales Office shall have one director who manages the affairs of the office, and shall be appointed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

When the purchasing and sales office is closed, all of them shall be allocated to improve the production and promotion of national goods. The supervisor shall not distribute the aforementioned remuneration. Article 9: At the end of each settlement period, the Fair Price Purchasing and Sales Office shall report the asset catalog, profit and loss statement, and balance sheet to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Joint Office of the Four Banks for verification and record. Article 10: The Fair Price Purchasing and Sales Office shall report the business situation to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Joint Office of the Four Banks for verification and record on a monthly basis. Article 11: The report forms in the previous two articles shall be reviewed, signed, and sealed by the supervisor.

### Shanghai Branch of the Joint Office of the Four Banks Reorganized and Established; Committee System Adopted with Three Groups: Business, Documents, and Accounting; All Loans Released Previously Are Taken Over by the Branch

The Shanghai Joint Loan Committee of the Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China) was established after the war. Later, the General Office of the Joint Office of the Four Banks was established, which was used to govern the Loan Committee. However, it moved to Chongqing with the internal movement of the war. As a result, the Shanghai Joint Loan Committee of the Four Banks formed an independent organization. Since the Supreme National Defense Council approved the "Ten Guidelines for Sound Central Financial Institutions in Wartime" on September 8, the General Office of the Joint Office of the Four Banks was reorganized and established accordingly. Regarding the matters of joint loans of the four banks, a Loan Office was established to take charge of them. The Shanghai Loan Committee has been reorganized into the Shanghai Branch of the Joint Office of the Four Banks in accordance with the methods formulated by the General Office of the Four Banks. A committee system is adopted, and one person is elected as the director from among the committee members. Three groups are set up under it: business, documents, and accounting. All loans released by the Loan Committee previously are taken over by the Shanghai Branch. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the branch yesterday that the outstanding loan balance at the end of last month was a total of 17.75 million yuan. The outstanding balance of loans directly released by the branch was 16.64 million yuan, and the outstanding balance of loans released by the Banking Industry Preparatory Committee was 1.11 million yuan.

### Students Compete for Seats on Streetcars: Disregarding the Elderly, Weak, and Women; Polite Individuals Are as Rare as Phoenix Feathers; Handsome Citizens Should Improve Themselves: A Letter from a Reader Published in the North China Daily News

The North China Daily News published a letter from "Forerunner" yesterday, offering advice on the politeness of students in this city, hoping that readers will correct their mistakes if they have them, and encourage themselves if they don't. The letter stated: "Shanghai's education costs millions of dollars a year, but the idea of cultivating young people into excellent citizens has obviously not been paid attention to in Shanghai's academic circles.

Let me give one example to prove the rest. For example, in streetcars and buses, students travel back and forth in droves, but polite individuals are as rare as phoenix feathers. They all rush to be first and disregard the fate of other male and female passengers. It seems that their only condition for survival is to squeeze through the door and grab a seat, and then they can be complacent and sit back and relax. Although young girls and old women are standing in the car, or holding books under their arms, or holding children in their arms, young students turn a blind eye to them and remain unmoved by being squeezed. There are very few who can offer their seats to these weaker individuals. There is another thing that I cannot bear to see, that is, yesterday I saw a tall young man at the streetcar stop on Henan Road, waiting for the car while talking to a female student. Unexpectedly, as soon as the streetcar arrived, this person grabbed the handrail and squeezed in first. His girlfriend struggled for a long time before getting on the car. The man then sat back in the car, letting his girlfriend stand in front of him and continue chatting. Young people and other passengers buy tickets and enjoy the same rights, which is of course not objectionable. What is regrettable is that these people seem to lack cultivation in common sense and politeness at school. In fact, this kind of cultivation is far better than erudition. If these people want to be excellent citizens, they should always consider others and not be selfish. In this way, their lives will be more harmonious and they will get along with others more happily when they enter the world to work, and others will be happier. I sincerely hope that the principals and teachers will instill in their students the idea of being polite individuals."

### Master Hong Yi Writing Books in Southern Fujian

In recent years, Master Hong Yi has been in seclusion in Yongchun, Southern Fujian. Recently, there have been rumors from the outside world that the Master has passed away, and Buddhist circles have been deeply saddened. It is learned that the Shanghai Jue You Qing Bi-Monthly Magazine recently received a letter from Master Xingchang, the attendant of Master Hong Yi, saying that Master Hong's health is better than usual, and he is currently editing the Nanshan Three Great Sections Table and writing a book on the Five Precepts for Laypeople. This proves that the rumors are completely unfounded.

### Wing On Third Factory Resumes Work; Workers Have Not All Arrived at the Factory; Resuming Night Work Is Still Pending

The strike at the Wing On Textile Third Factory on Macgregor Road in this city, after the enthusiastic efforts of people from all walks of life and relevant parties to mediate, the negotiations between labor and management gradually approached. In addition to the second requirement of the workers, which is to reinstate the ten workers who were previously dismissed, there was a slight dispute. The other two items, namely, resuming work immediately and increasing the rice subsidy by one dime per day, were accepted by the management, who were also considerate of the plight of more than 3,000 workers in this serious situation. One side immediately began registering workers to resume work, and it was scheduled to resume work yesterday morning (the 11th). According to a reporter from the Ta Chung News Agency, the factory resumed work yesterday morning. However, because there were not enough workers to allocate, only day work was opened, and night work was still suspended. Nearly 2,000 workers went to register for voluntary resumption of work. It was only because the factory had not fully accepted the "reinstatement of dismissed workers," and all the workers, in order to express their solidarity, did not go even though they registered. Night work may resume next Monday.

### New Anatolia Wheel from Wenzhou to Shanghai Runs Aground Mid-Journey, Now Safe, Passengers and Cargo Unharmed

The British-owned Moller Line's New Anatolia (ATiadne: Moller), represented by the Shanghai Qi Chang Shipping Company, has been operating the Shanghai-Wenzhou route for some time. It was learned yesterday that the vessel, loaded with passengers and cargo from Wenzhou on the 9th of this month, ran aground while sailing off the coast of Wenzhou, at 120 degrees 59.3 minutes East longitude and 27 degrees 50.5 minutes North latitude.

At the time of the grounding, there were no other ships anchored nearby, nor were there any sailing vessels passing through, so no assistance was available. The ship's captain immediately sent out a distress signal by wireless. Upon receiving the message in Shanghai, but lacking the vessel's precise location, repeated telegrams were sent to the vessel to inquire. Until yesterday, the vessel telegraphed that it had floated free from the sandbar at high tide. According to the company, fortunately, the waters off the coast of Wenzhou are mostly sandy, so no passengers or cargo were lost, and the vessel is now safely out of danger. All passengers on board are still traveling to Shanghai on the original vessel. However, the vessel's speed is slower, and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The detailed circumstances of the grounding have not yet been telegraphed, and will be known after the vessel arrives in Shanghai.

### Jewish Refugee Couple Arrives in Shanghai via Siberia, Vividly Describes Hardships En Route, Praises Soviet Union

According to foreign sources, a certain Jewish refugee couple who arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month spoke to reporters yesterday, detailing their journey from Germany to Shanghai via Siberia. They said that after their beloved son arrived in Shanghai, they telegraphed Germany, stating that their entry permits had been processed and requesting that they come to Shanghai quickly to reunite. After receiving the telegram, they registered with the Jewish Mutual Aid Committee, declaring their intention to leave Germany for Shanghai and paying 20% of the special tax owed by Jews up to 1939. The Jewish man continued, "After I returned home, I couldn't sleep all night. In the evening, I received another telegram from my son, asking if my luggage was ready, and I was at a loss for what to say. As for my neighbors and friends, they were all deeply concerned for me, because Jews are inherently jealous, and they think that Jews leaving Germany for Shanghai are the darlings of heaven. The next morning, I learned that going to Shanghai required passing through Siberia, but according to the Mutual Aid Committee, a 'Manchukuo' transit visa was extremely difficult to obtain." For the first ten days after starting their journey, they felt extremely tired, because they had to present their passports at every stop and had to run around everywhere. On February 12th, the couple was stopped at the Lithuanian border, and their pockets were empty, with only US$7.50 left, equivalent to 40 Dongs. However, the next day they were able to safely enter the Soviet Union. On the Soviet trains, most of the passengers were soldiers going to fight in Finland. The soldiers' uniforms were extremely neat. Soviet officials were kind to the Jewish refugees and called them the first to pass through with Jewish passports. Every station along the way had portraits of Stalin, or showed him giving speeches. They also said that after arriving in Moscow, they were led by a guide to stay at the Metropol Hotel, which was the grandest and most luxurious in all of Moscow. The accommodation fee was included in the train ticket. In Moscow, they stayed for three days and had to borrow 300 rubles from the German Consulate in the Soviet Union, signing a statement that the Jewish Mutual Aid Committee would repay it. The architecture and streets of Moscow were admirable. The people all wore leather clothes, and the soldiers' uniforms were the most elaborate. However, the goods displayed in Moscow department stores were mostly expensive and of poor quality. A university professor wanted to exchange a pair of old silk stockings from my wife for a cigar. In the hotel, a meal cost about 35 rubles, but the lowest wage for a worker in Moscow was 500 rubles. In the cafes, the music was extremely pleasant, and the patrons wore heavy fur coats and did not have the bad habit of failing to pay small bills. On the way to 'Manchukuo', we were awakened twice at night and had to walk in the snow in the cold while waiting for the train change to be completed. Passport checks were extremely strict when crossing the border. Afterwards, we passed through Manzhouli and transferred to Harbin. Fortunately, there were no accidents. The journey from Harbin to Shanghai was also smooth, but I felt that the journey was slow and my heart was like an arrow, because I was eager to see my beloved son. Now the father and son are hoping to find a stable job in Shanghai so they can spend their old age in this place, because their impression of Germany is not good and they do not want to return to their homeland."

Chengji Real Estate Company at Room 506, Hengli Building, 495 Henan Road, was founded by the Wang Jiarui brothers. The Wang family resides at No. 7, Lane 395, Xiyuanyuan Road. At around 8:00 AM on November 10th of last year, four kidnappers, each armed with a handgun, suddenly broke into the Wang's residence and forcibly kidnapped Wang Jiarui. Afterwards, they sent a letter to the family, demanding a huge ransom. Although the police were notified, the case has not been solved. It is reported that Wang was redeemed on December 8th for 14,000 yuan. However, the police believe that there must have been an inside connection in this case and began a secret investigation. They believe that Ye Fu'an, the bookkeeper from Ningbo, and Shen Kuantong, the rent collector from Ningbo, of Chengji Real Estate Company, are suspected of being involved in Wang's kidnapping. So the Chinese and foreign detectives from the Yulin Road police station arrested Ye and Shen at the Hengli Building the day before yesterday and took them to the police station for detention.

### Shanghai West Gambling Dens Reopen Yesterday, Various Parties Compete for Tax Revenue, Casinos in a Dilemma

The English "Great American Evening News" reported that the "Entertainment Venue Supervision Department" established by the Japanese in Shanghai West collected donations from various casinos, reaching one million yuan per month. This had been going on for two years. Suddenly, at midnight on the 10th, it was cleared and closed. However, the supervisors of the department did not implement the long-publicized order to close the casinos before leaving their posts. However, the casinos temporarily suspended operations on the morning of the 11th because the department was closed. One party notified the casinos that they would be managed by them in the future and that all donations would have to be paid to "Police Chief" Lu Ying of the "Municipal Police Bureau." At the same time, they were instructed to pay the donations to the "Shanghai Municipal Government." Upon hearing this news, the casinos were quite alarmed and immediately convened an emergency meeting at the Hollywood Casino. Upon hearing this news, one party quickly sent a team of military school students to the Hollywood Amusement Park for "protection." After the intervention of the Japanese military police, the casinos reopened at 2:00 PM today and have agreed that all donations will be paid to the Japanese military police from the 11th to the 31st of this month. From April 1st, they will be paid to one party.

### Robbery of White Powder Den, Capture of Robbers in Fight, Stray Bullet Injures a Passerby

No. 61 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, has recently been a newly opened Korean-run drug den, specializing in white powder. Its scale is grand, and its business is thriving, which has been coveted by criminals. At around 7:20 PM last night, three thugs, two of whom showed guns, forced their way into the house, intending to rob white powder. However, the Korean was cunning and hid the goods, so nothing was lost. As a result, 2,000 yuan in national currency was robbed. When the bandits fled with the money, the Korean owner was unwilling to let it go and followed them. Crossing Seymour Road East, to the intersection of Gordon Road and McBain Road, he saw two street patrolmen, Nos. 2884 and 2618, standing there. He immediately went forward and reported the situation. The two Chinese patrolmen drew their guns and chased after them. They first fired several shots, and the bandits also fired back, but neither side hit. As a result, two robbers were captured on the spot, and the other robber escaped. During the exchange of fire, bullets flew everywhere. A passerby, Zhang Chaozeng, 26 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 266 Seymour Road, was on his way home from the nearby Tongliangtang Chinese medicine store when he was hit in the face by a stray bullet. The bullet did not exit, and blood flowed non-stop, and one of his front teeth was knocked out. He was sent to Baolong Hospital by ambulance, summoned by the patrolman for treatment.

### Soy Sauce Garden Manager Dies in Prison, Plaintiff Reserves Civil Suit

Pu Qudan, manager of Wanyu Soy Sauce Garden at No. 190 Malan Road, French Concession, from Jiading, was over fifty years old. He had served in the garden for thirty to forty years and was trusted by the owner, Shen Benyan. However, in recent years, prices have soared, and he became addicted to opium, which led to him not being able to make ends meet. He successively embezzled accounts amounting to 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. On December 26th of last year, the owner discovered the embezzlement while checking the accounts, reported it to the French Concession police, and sent him to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for public prosecution. Judge Sun sentenced Pu Qudan to eight months in prison for opium addiction and one year in prison for continuous business embezzlement, to be served concurrently for one year and two months. Pu was sent to prison to serve his sentence. He died in prison due to illness and opium withdrawal. As for Shen's attached civil suit for 29,880 yuan, it was summoned for trial in the Seventh Civil Division by Judge Chen Can yesterday morning. Shen's lawyer, Wu Zhaozhen, acted as his agent. Because the defendant was dead, he requested that the civil suit be reserved so that he could investigate the defendant's son and then file the lawsuit again. The court then ruled to postpone the date and await the plaintiff's supplementary statement before further questioning.

### College Student Chen Zongtao Commits Fraud by Issuing Bad Checks, Trial Concluded, Released on Bail of 50,000 Yuan Pending Judgment

Chen Zongtao (24 years old), a Cantonese youth and student at Shanghai Law School, often frequented dance halls in the past and wasted a lot of money, which he could not make up for. Suddenly, in October of last year, he had a strange idea and colluded with a classmate, Feng Ruizhang, who was on the run, and went to the residence of his classmate's elder sister, Wu Shaofen (18 years old, from Nanhui), at No. 15, Lane 245, Pushi Road, falsely claiming that the province of Henan produced antimony aluminum and that no one in Shanghai was in this business, requesting that Wu partner with him to handle the business, saying that they would definitely make a huge profit in the future, saying things that were all talk and no substance. At that time, Wu believed it to be true and invested 28,000 yuan, and later added another 1,300 yuan, stating that the principal would be returned with interest in two months, to be delivered on December 26th of the same year, and four checks from the Kenye Bank dated January 5th of this year, with a total face value of 37,300 yuan, as repayment of principal and profit dividends. Unexpectedly, when Wu went to the bank to collect the money, it could not be cashed due to insufficient funds. So she negotiated with Chen, who repeatedly made excuses and delayed. At this point, Wu realized that she had been deceived and reported it to the French Concession police the day before yesterday, who sent detectives to arrest Chen Zongtao. However, the accomplice, Feng Ruizhang, fled after hearing the news. Yesterday, the police sent Chen to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for legal prosecution. After being questioned, the defendant admitted to issuing bad checks and hired lawyer Xu Wufang to defend him. Judge Zhu stated that the case was clear and announced the end of the debate, setting the date for judgment on the 18th of this month. The defendant was released on bail of 50,000 yuan.

### Minor Girl Confirmed to Inherit Identity, Court Orders Postponement to Summon Witnesses

The statement roughly stated that the plaintiff's father, Lin Gen, died of illness in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). At that time, his grandfather, Chunlin, and grandmother, Ji, were still alive. Until November 21st of last year, the grandfather passed away, and a nephew of the grandfather's clan, the defendant, took advantage of the plaintiff's young age and lack of ability during the grandfather's illness, and recklessly took the position of head of the family. After the grandfather passed away, he even arbitrarily disposed of all the inheritance. Please, in accordance with Articles 1138 and 1140 of the Civil Code, the court should issue a judgment, etc. After receiving the statement, the court, presided over by Judge Chen Can, opened the Seventh Civil Division for trial. The defendant was represented in court by lawyer Xu Wufang. After questioning in court, because it was necessary to summon witnesses, it was ordered to postpone the date to the 14th for further questioning.

Business News

### Stable Financial and Exchange Markets

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions were affected by the overseas US and British exchange rates, which fell sharply by 2.875 points. Therefore, the HSBC US exchange rate listing in Shanghai continued to shrink by .0625, reaching 6.4375 yuan. The Dutch, Romanian, and Japanese exchange rates also showed small listings, while the British exchange rate remained stable. As for the domestic market situation, although it was the beginning of the week, there was no improvement. The reason is that HSBC has been supplying British gold at 4 pence 125 as much as possible, and they are happy to absorb it at a slightly lower price, so speculators have no opportunity to act, and the bulls dare not increase their stakes, and most are temporarily waiting and watching. Therefore, trading is sluggish, and everything is insignificant to the market. It is absolutely impossible for any drastic changes to occur. The process of the day was extremely stable. The morning opening continued the old pattern of British stability and US tightness, with prices at 4 pence 140625 and 6.65625 yuan. Later, a Hong Kong telegram came out to release, followed by a certain foreign bank and money changers also selling to each other, so at that time the US exchange rate had slightly hardened to 6.6875 yuan. Afterwards, the Japanese foreign bank came to pick up futures, but the number was small, and fortunately, the foreign banks were still willing to supply, so it was not affected. The noon hour was dull and flat, and there was no change until the close. The afternoon market was even quieter, and little trading was heard. By the evening close, it was still similar to the noon close, calculated as 4 pence 140625 and 6.6875 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous British day, the British was stable and the US was tight by 0.3125. The potential of futures is the same as the spot price.

HSBC Lists US Exchange Rate Reduced Again

At the beginning of the morning, the London Large Item, London Raw Gold, and US Bank prices were closed for business, and the exchange rates of British, US, Shanghai, and French exchange rates were all flat. The US exchange rate fell sharply by 2.875 points against the British, unchanged against Shanghai, and slightly by 1.625 points against French. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 4 pence 140625 for British gold and 6.65625 yuan for the US exchange rate, which were British stable and US reduced by 0.0625 compared to the previous weekend, which was due to the continued decline in exchange rates. After opening, the Hong Kong telegram first came to sell the foreign bank spot British gold at 4 pence 140625. At the same time, foreign banks also made some mutual transactions at the previous price. The HSBC listing was announced, with the British stable and the US reduced by 0.0625. The White Silver Balance Tax was announced, with no increase or decrease. Afterwards, money changers frequently came to sell US dollar bills at 6.75 and 7.8125 to foreign banks such as Chase Dehua. At that time, Chinese banks also sold US exchange rates for the current month at 6.625 to speculators, which caused the US exchange rate to slightly harden at that time, and the spot price rose to 6.6875 yuan. Afterwards, Japanese foreign banks came to pick up overdue contracts, but some banks were quite willing to supply, so it was not affected. It is estimated that picking up and absorbing the April US exchange rate was 6.5625 yuan, and the May British gold was 4 pence 03125. Later, a certain bank sold the Chinese-Italian US exchange rate for the current month to a peer at 6.6875, so the market was quite stable. The volume of transactions decreased at noon, and the state became more dull. Until the close, the British gold was still at 4 pence 140625, and the US exchange rate was at 6.6875 yuan, which was British stable and US slightly relaxed by 0.3125 compared to the morning opening.

Rarely Any Transactions in the After-Market

The after-market state was quieter, and buying and selling were waiting and not moving forward. Little trading was heard. Until the evening close, British gold was still at 4 pence 140625, and the US exchange rate was still at 6.6875 yuan. The British gold for this month was 4 pence 125, and the US exchange rate was 6.65625 yuan. The British gold for the next month was 4 pence 078125, and the US exchange rate was 6.5625 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the current British was stable, and the US was slightly tighter by 0.3125.

### Gold Market Without Major Fluctuations

Yesterday, the cash "cooked red" (speculative gold) market was uneventful. The fluctuations remained narrow, and transactions were sluggish. However, the market trend was still firm. The opening price in the morning was five yuan higher, at 4,785 yuan, because the U.S. dollar exchange rate was tight. Subsequently, a certain securities firm and a certain gold shop competed to buy, pushing the price up by another fifteen yuan, reaching a peak of 4,800 yuan. But the U.S. dollar exchange rate slightly rebounded, and the securities firm and gold shop sold off one after another, immediately falling back to 4,786 yuan. Fortunately, not long after, money changers bought in more, and silver shops also made purchases at the same time. Therefore, although a certain securities firm suddenly resumed selling, the closing price was still 4,789 yuan. The market was quiet in the afternoon, but as a result, a certain money changer frequently absorbed on behalf of customers, rising another four yuan to close at 4,793 yuan, an increase of thirteen yuan compared to last weekend's settlement price. The total transaction volume for the day was about 700 taels. Gold ornaments from silver shops and customs gold remained flat.

"Cooked Red" Rises Thirteen Yuan

A certain silver shop bought 50 taels from Yu Hao, at 4,785 yuan. Shortly after, a securities firm and a certain gold shop also mutually purchased, pushing the price up another fifteen yuan. The securities firm bought 20 taels from the silver shop, at 4,800 yuan. At that time, the U.S. dollar exchange rate suddenly reported a slight increase, and another securities firm immediately sold on behalf of its firm, plus the gold shop also sold, causing a decrease of fourteen yuan. The securities firm sold 30 taels to the money changer, at 4,786 yuan. Subsequently, due to purchases by silver shops and money changers, the price rose again by eight yuan. The silver shop bought 50 taels from the cash gold shop, at 4,794 yuan. After this, a certain securities firm suddenly resumed selling, causing a drop of six yuan. The securities firm sold 40 taels to the silver shop, at 4,788 yuan. Following this, a certain silver shop resold 40 taels to the securities firm, at 4,789 yuan, as the noon closing price. The initial opening price in the afternoon was slightly pressed down by one yuan, with the gold shop selling 30 taels to the silver shop, at 4,788 yuan. Subsequently, because a certain money changer absorbed more than one hundred taels, the price suddenly rose by four yuan. The money changer bought 20 taels from the cash gold shop, at 4,792 yuan. Later, the gold shop sold off slightly, causing a decline of two yuan. The gold shops mutually traded 10 taels, at 4,790 yuan. Finally, due to the money changer's resumed purchasing, the price was raised again by three yuan. The silver shop sold 10 taels to the gold shop, at 4,793 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it increased by thirteen yuan compared to last weekend's settlement price. The fluctuation range for the entire day was fifteen yuan.

### U.S. Dollar Notes Firm

British gold notes were weak at first and then firm, initially falling to 54 yuan and 9 jiao, and then rebounding to 55 yuan. The final price was unchanged. U.S. dollar notes were very firm and high due to the frequent decline in the pound price. The price rose firmly in the morning to 14 yuan, 7 jiao, and 6 fen.

### Yarn and Cotton Flowers: Factories Close, Cotton Yarn Rises Even More Sharply

After hovering for two days, the yarn market continued to advance yesterday, and the upward trend was particularly strong. This was because the foreign exchange market was calm, raw materials were firm and high, and factories did not produce yarn. As a result, speculators became more and more bullish. With a slight increase in purchases, the market gradually rose. March futures for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose directly from 920 yuan to 931 yuan.

The spot yarn market opened with good sentiment in the morning. Due to inquiries revealing demand from Cantonese merchants, scalpers mostly bought in.

Soon after, it was heard that the foreign exchange market continued to shrink, and the market situation became even more encouraging, rising directly to 931 yuan.

As a result, the closing price was up 2-3 pound notes compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market has been unable to improve recently, with forecasts predicting a drop of one rupee. Egyptian cotton rose by more than 20 pound notes yesterday.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trading market has become quiet again. There has been no enthusiastic ordering among industry counterparts as in the past few days. Moreover, the U.S. dollar exchange rate is tight, and the translated cotton price is very expensive. Therefore, foreign firms have very few transactions in shipped goods, and factories have remained very quiet. Japanese manufacturers have enough raw materials for several months, so they have not been heard to purchase in the market. The factory delivery price of yesterday's cotton market, converted at a U.S. dollar exchange rate of 6.675, is as follows:

20-count American Metric 266.2

Also, sub-standard 255.50

32-count Also 279.00

Also, sub-standard 268.00

42-count Also 283.20

Also, sub-standard 270.30

A large amount of American cotton has arrived in Shanghai. It is reported that the Norwegian steamer Volunteer, managed by the U.S. President Lines, arrived from San Francisco with more than 16,000 pieces of cotton. According to the company's information, the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai last night, and should be able to enter the port by this morning at the latest. It is scheduled to berth at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou and unload the cargo to the warehouse (year).

### Securities: Public Bonds Calm, Market Only Settles Transactions

The securities grey market remained hovering between five fen and one jiao yesterday, and people's hearts were therefore calm. The meeting time was also shortened accordingly. The market relied only on both sides slightly settling transactions to decorate the market. The stability of market prices was unprecedented, and the difference between various high and low prices was only five fen to one jiao. Investors were waiting for the right time to move, and speculators had no opportunity to take advantage of, so they watched each other. As a result of the day, only Ding shares were slightly lower by two jiao, while the rest were extremely peaceful. The transaction volume was about 400,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Stock transactions: 40 shares of Guohuo Company were traded at a price of 25 yuan each.

Moreover, the stock market of the Public Industry Exchange opened strongly and powerfully, with large transactions and prices higher than last week. This again triggered a considerable selling trend, but buyers had an exceptionally good appetite at slightly lower prices. The most frequently traded shares were Jardine Matheson, Shanghai Silver Company, and British United, etc. The former once saw a high price of 44 yuan, and the closing price fell back to 43 yuan. The latter also fell back to close at 39 yuan and 23.5 yuan respectively. Rubber shares were firm and stable, and prices did not change much. Speculators and investors are eagerly awaiting the announcement of the 1939 dividend of the various companies, which will be finalized soon.

### Grains: 100,000 Foreign Rice Arrives Yesterday, Large Quantities Still Being Shipped

Yesterday's rice market initially saw sellers still trying to hold up prices due to the aftereffects of the previous day. However, local shops were hesitant to move. Suddenly, the Chinese merchant Jian Yuanhang sold futures No. 1 Saigon rice at 53 yuan, with a transaction volume of 450 tons. Subsequently, another 600 tons were sold at prices ranging from 52.75 yuan to 52.5 yuan. General original merchants and hawkers then changed their minds and sought to sell, and floating hoarders followed suit. In an instant, the market softened again. As a result, except for broken rice, which remained particularly firm due to the lack of market supply, the prices of all other goods, such as Saigon fire-rolled rice, fell again by more than half a yuan. The closing price of No. 1 Saigon rice was 44 yuan, fire-rolled Pagoda brand was 43 yuan, mixed grades were 42.5 yuan and 42 yuan, and small-rolled rice fell from 39.5-6 jiao to 39 yuan and 38.8 jiao.

Although the glutinous rice market was flat, the price level was low. Compared with inland market prices, it was difficult to make a profit. Owners were unwilling to sell lightly, and there was little change. The shipment of thick and thin japonica rice from Hongkou continued at more than 500 bags. Rumors of off-market trading continued to spread, but sellers were unwilling to sell cheaply due to their own interests, so the transaction volume was small and the market price was stable. It is said that the goods that arrived were initially not allowed to be transported to Shanghai by a certain party, and after repeated attempts, a special fee of 14 yuan per bag was added, and 30% was required as military expenditure. Taking Wuxi thick white japonica rice as an example, although it only sells for 28 yuan per stone locally, the cost of delivery to Shanghai, including miscellaneous expenses, bag skins, and all losses, is close to 50 yuan. However, it is not known whether this statement is true or not. Today is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, and the rice market is closed for one day to commemorate him.

Another large shipment of foreign rice has arrived. The Java Company's Zhishaluya postal ship, directly from Saigon, brought more than 79,000 bags, arriving in Shanghai at around 3 PM yesterday and berthing at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong wheel brought 4,668 bags from Siam and 6,322 bags from Hong Kong, entering the port yesterday morning and unloading at the company's wharf in the French Concession. The Jardine Matheson Company's Mingsheng wheel also brought 12,675 bags from Hong Kong, arriving at the port at around 8 AM yesterday. The total amount of foreign rice imported yesterday was a huge 100,265 bags. It is heard that a large batch is still being shipped continuously (Zu).

### Additional Consolidated Tax Handled, Returned Flour Rises Again

The flour market trend gradually turned upward again. The "Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau" has revoked the suspension of export tax invoices for flour. A secretly increased tax of one jiao per stack of goods, intended to be sold at 15 yuan per bag. Customers continued to load the stored flour, so people's hearts were better and those holding stacks of goods were not in a hurry to sell. It is heard that the price of Green Cannon stacks of goods must be 14.7-8 jiao, but there was no formal agreement. Old stacks of goods were traded because inland villages were moving, initially opening at 14.4 jiao, and then rising to 4.5 jiao and 5 jiao. Fuxin brand was 14.3 jiao. The factory-direct sales price remained at the original price of 10 yuan, and there was no possibility of change for the time being.

The wheat market also turned bullish. It was found that Suzhou wheat once fell to 23 yuan last weekend. Now, with the flour market turning firm and the current lack of domestic wheat supply, it immediately rebounded. Yesterday, it was heard that the Fuxin factory bought over 2,000 bags and then rose back to 24 yuan. Other goods had almost no transactions.

### Oil Cakes and Soybeans Speculation Becomes Active Again

Soybeans, a daily necessity for the people, were once pulled back in price due to the constraints of public opinion. Last weekend, the actual sales of soybeans first started, and speculators became active again, the market soared, and prices were high. As a result, soybean oil rose by 2.5 yuan compared to Saturday. 140 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded (price details in the market price column), 40 barrels of Jiangbei oil, 50 dan of Dayou factory oil, and 80 dan of Taishan factory oil "Japanese merchants". The export of peanut oil was unchanged in Hong Kong. It was dragged in by line hoards and stocks, and the selling price initially fell by about one yuan due to slow sales, and finally returned to the level of two yuan. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 120 barrels of Qingdao oil, 100 barrels of Jiangbei oil, and 600 cans of Yantai oil were sold.

The soybean sales market remained strong among various merchant groups, so scalpers roamed the market and market conditions changed rapidly. The closing price was higher than last weekend's market by 1.4-5 jiao. A total of four trucks of Bengbu beans, two trucks of Dalian beans, 300 bags of Wuhu beans, three trucks of Nanjing beans, 500 bags of Dingjiazhou beans, and more than 300 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were traded.

Miscellaneous: For export, 570 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong on the 10th and 60 bags on the 12th.

### Coal: Indian Coal Floods the Market

The spot market for Indian bituminous coal has suddenly become flooded in recent days. Yesterday, a certain company had an order of 5,000 tons arrive at the port. Merchants and customers mostly have goods on hand, causing general floating accounts to sell out, and the market price has plummeted. For counterpart stacks of goods, Indian Calcutta lumps are listed at 240-250 yuan per ton, and small pieces are 235 yuan. For goods leaving the warehouse, the line is on the outside, and for customers issuing from this street, an additional 15 yuan is added.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sales Particularly Strong, Market Rises by Half a Yuan

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, sales among local merchants improved, and cloth prices were firm. The main buyers of Da Peng Fugui fine cloth and 14.16-pound Earth coarse cloth were local dyeing factories and Ningbo merchants. The price of spot goods suddenly rose by as much as 5 jiao per piece. The price of bleached and printed calico from the British Jardine Matheson Lun Chang Second Factory also rose by 2.5-5 jiao per piece. The rise in other goods was weaker. Merchants from the Zhejiang route Wen and Yong bought more than 600 pieces of colored flower cloth and bleached cloth. Merchants from Fujian bought more than 100 pieces of silk-colored cloth and bleached cloth, and Cantonese merchants bought more than 4,000 pieces. Local dyeing factories bought more than 300 bales of bleached and dyed cloth. Wholesale shops purchased more than 10,000 pieces of bleached calico, printed light-colored poplin, and coarse cloth.

Eastern Cloth: The market atmosphere continued to rise, because the merchants in this street were still keen to buy. Yesterday, the total transaction volume of white fine cloth and fine twill in the market was about 1,000 pieces. The current price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth has been listed at 27.4 yuan per piece, with the current month's futures at 27.8 yuan, and the April futures at 28.4 yuan. Foreign firms have also ordered Dragon Head fine cloth, also for April delivery, at 28.4 yuan, but the amount is not large. The current price of colored Four Gentlemen Serge has risen to 8.3 fen per yard, and the current month's price is 8.45 fen.

Export: For cloth, 52 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday (the 11th), and 770 pieces will be shipped to Ningbo today (the 12th), 20 pieces to Hong Kong, another 445 pieces to Tule, and another 105 pieces to Siam.

### Sugar Market: Che Chi Opens 1,000 Bags

Yesterday, foreign sugar prices tended to settle down. The association marked the market for spot goods at 62 yuan for 24 coarse white (local warehouse), 61.6 jiao for newly arrived (foreign warehouse), 61.2 jiao for old goods, and 48.5 yuan for re-exported goods. Taikoo car white sugar was slightly higher for the upper grade and slightly higher for the lower grade. B-mark Western warehouse was 65.7 yuan, CW mark was 65 yuan, CX mark was 64.5 yuan, DY mark was 63.8 jiao, HX mark was 63 yuan. B-mark Western warehouse had a larger price drop, to 65.3-64.8 yuan. Xin Yi Company opened 1,000 bags of H-mark Che Chi sugar. Because the prices were more favorable, new goods were 44 yuan and old goods were 43 yuan. If sales were smooth, this snow white sugar would be worth 5 jiao, at 61.5 yuan. This No. 1 rock sugar had a price reduction to 74 yuan. Jingming ice was 75.5 yuan. The Xinghua merchant group put out more than ten bags of Xinghua Qing candy, with a particularly high price of 54.5 yuan. The Guangdong merchant group put out 50 bags of sub-white sugar, at 59 yuan.

### Marine Products　Western Sea Cucumber Sales Continue

Western sea cucumbers, such as red jade sea cucumbers, have recently been continuously available. Prices are similar to previous market prices. However, the supply of square sea cucumbers is quite limited, and the market feels a severe shortage. Several pieces were sold yesterday at particularly high prices. Top-quality square ones were priced at 338 yuan, large square ones at 303 yuan, and medium square ones at 256 yuan. It has been observed that the remaining stock of black sea cucumber is dwindling, and it has already been sold for 270 yuan, with expectations of continued firmness.

### Memorial for the Passing of Premier Today　Joint Conference of Educational Circles Addresses Colleagues in the Educational Field　To Conduct the Most Effective Memorial Based on the Needs of the Nation

Today marks the 15th anniversary of the passing of Premier [Sun Yat-sen]. The Joint Conference of Educational Circles in this city, in order to instruct colleagues in the educational field on how to effectively commemorate the passing of the Premier, has specifically issued a letter to the educational community of the entire city. Excerpts of the main points are as follows: Our commemoration of the passing of the Premier is not merely holding a memorial ceremony or taking a day off. We must conduct the most effective commemoration based on the current national situation and the needs of the times. At the very least, we must achieve the following points: (1) When we commemorate the passing of the Premier, we must integrate and instill into the minds of students the Premier's lifelong dedication to revolution and the hardships and facts of creating the Republic of China, so that they know that everyone must rise up and continue the unfinished work of the Premier and strive for the country. (2) When we commemorate the passing of the Premier, we must train students with the Premier's spirit of fearlessness of the strong and unwillingness to be threatened, so that they know that in difficult and arduous circumstances, they should bury themselves in hard work and actively struggle in order to win the final victory. (3) When we commemorate the passing of the Premier, we must fully elaborate on the true meaning of the Three Principles of the People and its relationship to building an independent and free modern China, so that everyone can have a deep understanding of the principles. (4) When we commemorate the passing of the Premier, we must make the unity and organization of the faculty and staff themselves a model for all students, and make the active struggle of the educational field a model for all citizens, because only unity and struggle can win the final victory. If we can achieve the above four points, we can be considered to have truly done the work of commemorating the passing of the Premier, and in the field of education, we will vigorously exert his due skills in education and fulfill his due tasks in the war of resistance.

### National Education Conference　Opened in Chongqing

(Chongqing, 11th) The National Education Conference of various provinces and cities opened in Chongqing on the 11th. Attendees included Director Chen Li-fu of the Education Department, Director Gu Yu-xiu of the Decision-Making Department, Vice Minister Yu Jing-tang, and the directors of the education departments of Sichuan, Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Suiyuan provinces, as well as the director of the Chongqing Social Affairs Bureau.

### Yunnan Education Department Appoints　Kunming Teachers College and Yunrui Middle School Principals

(Kunming Correspondence) The Education Department recently ordered the appointment of Zhang Fengqi as the acting principal of the Provincial Kunhua Normal School.

### Tao Xingzhi Establishes Yucai School in Chongqing　Training Outstanding Child Refugees from Nursery Homes

(Chongqing Correspondence) Tao Xingzhi recently established the Yucai School in an ancient temple in the suburbs of Chongqing. He invited experts such as Sun Mingdong, Chang Xueyong, Zhang Min, and Lu Weite to select more than 70 outstanding child refugees with special talents from various children's nursery homes to become students of the school. However, because these child refugees have suffered from long-term wandering and have been subjected to the hardships of wind, frost, hunger, and cold, their bodies are often unhealthy and afflicted with diseases. If they were immediately ordered to study and work, it would be detrimental to both their physical and mental well-being. Therefore, doctors were specially invited to treat and cure the various diseases of these children, so that they could return to their original state of innocence and vitality. The school then adopted a collective living education based on the school's collectivist philosophy, combined with the goals of Chinese education and the needs of resistance and reconstruction. Furthermore, it aimed to rectify the fallacies of past talent education. Therefore, all the children were divided into social groups, literary groups, drama groups, music groups, painting groups, science groups, arts and crafts groups, and agricultural groups, according to their interests in learning. Specialists in each group were invited to lead their respective affairs, such as Wei Dongming for the literary group, Zhang Min for the drama group, He Luting for the music group, and Sun Mingxun for the social group. The remaining groups were led by Wang Dongruo, Ma Luxian, and Shuai Changshu. Under the guidance of these excellent teachers, all the students of the school worked hard to advance towards the principle of combining teaching and learning and the characteristics of the school. Therefore, although it has been less than a few months since its establishment, the achievements have been surprisingly rapid. The literary group established the Lu Xun Team to learn from Lu Xun's spirit and knowledge to promote literature. The social group devotes one-third of its time to social work. The drama group has already been able to perform six plays. The remaining groups are also doing their best to发挥本能, achieving a state of integrated learning and working in life.

### Laughable Joint Trial

After the opening of trade, Shanghai had two joint trial courts, originally established to handle Sino-Western disputes; however, over time, lawsuits involving Chinese citizens were also invariably subject to joint trial by Western officials. As there were no perceived improprieties, the people accepted this. Recently, in the western section of Zhenfeng Street in the British Concession, some hooligans rented a house for gambling, known as "Wooden Bowl," which was actually a type of lottery. The other day, Chen Kema issued a warrant, which the British Consul signed, ordering the bailiff to notify the police to assist in the arrest. The ringleaders of the gamblers were known as "Pointy Pockmarked Face" and "Huzhou Ah Si." The bailiff delivered the warrant to the police station, requesting them to send officers to make the arrests. However, the suspects had already fled upon hearing the news, and only two individuals who were collecting small debts at the gambling den were apprehended. Consequently, the bailiff brought the suspects and the gambling equipment to the police station. The police, noting that the warrant issued by the public court did not match the names of the apprehended individuals, promptly released the two suspects. Yesterday, the bailiff brought the gambling equipment to the court. That day, an Austrian translator named Xia was presiding over the joint trial. He was furious, exclaiming, "Since there is a gambling den in the concession, the police should investigate and make arrests. Now that a bailiff has been dispatched to apprehend the gamblers, why haven't the gambling criminals been arrested? Instead, only the tables have been brought in! What is the meaning of this?" The local headman, Xie Chunshan, reported, "After receiving the warrant, I first reported to the police station and requested them to dispatch officers. I was unaware that the gamblers had already fled upon hearing the news. The blame rests on my subordinates. However, the two individuals apprehended were indeed at the scene and turned over to the police." He added, "All the gambling equipment is normally turned over to the court." Xia was still furious and requested that the local headman be dismissed. He then said to Chen Kema, "These people are arresting gamblers, but in reality, they are simply forcibly taking property." Chen Sima could no longer tolerate this and slammed his fist on the table, exclaiming, "This office issued a warrant for the bailiff to assist in arresting gamblers. What do you mean 'forcibly taking property'? This is gambling equipment and should be destroyed. If someone accuses us of forcibly taking property from law-abiding citizens, this office will handle the matter according to the law. How dare you slander us?" The Western official then left in a huff, and Chen Sima also stormed out of the court.

### Suicidal People

— Huang Jiayin

In a place like Shanghai, suicide cases occur almost daily, especially since the recent surge in prices. The pressure of life and the coldness of society drive some of the weaker individuals down the path of self-destruction, which is truly heartbreaking to think about.

A psychiatrist, when discussing suicide cases, said that suicidal people are like a wall with large holes, covered with wallpaper on the outside. Normally, they appear no different from ordinary people. However, after violent wind and rain, the wallpaper tears, revealing the holes in the wall, and eventually the wall collapses.

From a psychological perspective, this analogy is quite fitting. People are originally living to live, and seeking death should not be a normal occurrence. Therefore, some people think that suicidal people have courage, which is not true, because they lack the courage to live. And the 'courage to commit suicide' is not really courage.

We have an old saying: "Only after the weather turns cold do we know that pine and cypress trees wither last," which is the same idea. Some people can survive after being battered by the storms of society. Their will to live not only does not diminish but becomes more active and courageous. But some people cannot withstand the blows.

Therefore, suicide is a social problem, and also a mental health problem.

### The English-French Undersea Tunnel

— Jieliu

In the current situation, to maintain the safety of traffic between Britain and France, it is essential to build an undersea tunnel.

The coastlines between England and France seem very suitable for digging tunnels: the channel is not deep, the coastal land is pure chalk, and there are no irregular rock layers underground. Moreover, there is a small island in the center of the channel. When the undersea tunnel passes under the island, it can also open a vent directly to the sea.

French parliamentarian Marcel Boucher recently submitted a plan to the parliament to build a tunnel. He advocated using an electromagnetic tube to transport passengers.

His plan is as follows:

Inside the tunnel, lay a large circular tube with a diameter of one and a half meters, and a streamlined train runs in the tube, with a track width of ninety centimeters. The train slides in the coil, which is composed of many hollow large coils, wound on the large circular tube at equal intervals. When the train passes, the current passes through the coil in front of it, and it continues to be attracted forward by the magnetic force.

Because the force that propels the train is the attraction of electromagnetism, there is no machinery on the train, and no driver is needed. This type of vehicle has very few risks when driving, and it does not require much maintenance. Other aspects, such as the turning of the tracks, intersections, and the lights along the way, have been carefully studied and satisfactory results have been obtained.

As for the speed of the electromagnetic vehicle, it can reach one hundred meters per second, but for safety reasons, it is only necessary to use a speed of twenty-five meters per second, which is sufficient, because at this speed, the train can already fly at one hundred kilometers per hour.

This type of vehicle is fast, economical (using very little electricity), safe, and convenient. Once it can be realized, the convenience of transportation will naturally be unmatched.

### The Four Seasons of Life

— Xiaofang

"Life" has four seasons, just like the spring, summer, autumn, and winter of the natural world, from childhood to youth to adulthood to old age.

Childhood is living in "spring," so innocent, lively, and endearing. You do whatever you want to do.

Youth is living in "summer," so vibrant, passionate, in love, this is a golden age. However, their lives are also distressed and worried, perhaps because they want to get everything they don't have all at once!

Adulthood is living in "autumn," so clear, calm, hardworking, he has experienced many people and events, enriched his experiences, and the path has already reached the period of fruition. Regarding past memories, he feels a little bit of regret, so he works hard and does not shirk hardships.

Old age is living in "winter," so cold and desolate, he has stopped working, and he only has memories of the past. The god of death often wanders by his side. He loves children, but he is also saddened by the young children, always with wrinkled faces and furrowed brows.

Psychology

### Adult Learning

— Yang Tongfang

Traditional thought has a great misunderstanding about adult learning. In the past society, not only did people generally believe that adults could not learn new things, but even psychologists such as James and Hollingworth doubted the efficiency of adult learning. Since authoritative scholars made such claims, and social prejudices were so deep, the prejudice became greater, and the accumulated habits became more ingrained. Although some people believe that adults can also learn, their learning ability is far inferior to that of children and young people. Today's educational system particularly emphasizes the training of children and young people, providing them with a large amount of knowledge and skills during this period for lifelong application. This idea is very detrimental to the future of adult education.

The factual basis obtained from modern psychological experiments proves the errors of traditional thought. Since Professor Thorndike of the United States published the book "Adult Learning" after two years of research and experimentation, he broke the fallacies of his predecessors about adult learning. He conducted precise experiments from simple muscle movements to complex abilities, proving that adult learning is not only possible, but also its efficiency is not lower than that of children and young people. A forty-year-old person has an unexpectedly fast learning progress due to their full understanding. Mr. Sang said: "Age is a very small factor for the success and failure of learning; ability, interest, energy, and time are the important reasons." So far, Mr. Sang is still continuing his research, hoping to obtain more important basis for adult learning from the relationship between adult interests and motivation and learning.

Of course, there were also reasons for the misunderstanding of adult learning in the past. Economics and time are obstacles to adult learning, especially in our country where most people are struggling on the verge of starvation. How can they have the opportunity to learn? If we can find ways to remedy this, improve the economic conditions of adults, and reduce working hours, we firmly believe that we can fully develop their talents in order to contribute their full efforts.

In short, the rise of adult learning research in recent times shows the dawn of the future of adult education. We must recognize that raising people's cultural level is the foundation of national revitalization; the complexity of modern social life cannot be adapted only by the knowledge and skills gained during childhood or youth. The enlightened people of the times, quickly take on the mission of promoting the adult education movement!

### Cai Yuanpei and the New Script

— Chen Gangjun

Mr. Cai Yuanpei was a champion of the Chinese language reform movement.

In the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919), the two major trends of the literary revolution and the national language unification movement began to converge, sparking a surging high tide. Those who opposed this reform movement also launched fierce attacks. Mr. Cai Yuanpei was at Peking University at the time, and he always gave a strong rebuttal to this attack. Mr. Cai's pen war with Lin Shu has become a very valuable page in Chinese cultural history. Mr. Cai should also be credited with the final victory of vernacular literature.

Mr. Cai has always been consistent in supporting and promoting phonetic writing. In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), Mr. Cai convened a temporary education conference as the Minister of Education, which passed the "Qieyin Alphabet" (ie phonetic symbols), and worked hard to promote it under various difficulties. At that time, there was also a great help from Zhang Yiyi. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Cai have always been fighting on the same front. For example, in the National Language Research Association in the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917), Cai was the president, and Zhang was the vice president. The two have been working tirelessly together. Mr. Zhang must be very sad at the death of Mr. Cai this time.

Mr. Cai vigorously supported the emerging Latinization (ie Romanization) movement. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China (1928), when he was the president of the University Council (ie Minister of Education), he announced the "National Language Romanization", which others would never announce.

In "On the Reform of Chinese Characters," he said: "Since Chinese characters must be reformed, they can be directly changed to use Latin alphabets." From this, it can be seen that he is also one of the initiators of the Latinization movement.

The National Language Movement has not achieved much in the past ten years, because it is too difficult in fact to eliminate countless local dialects with one local dialect, especially for the hard-working masses who have short rest time. In order to quickly eliminate illiteracy, Mr. Cai decided to abandon the method of unifying the national language, and adopted the way of unifying the language by mixing dialects, that is, advocating the way of mass language.

He said: "In terms of both time and money, the new script is the most economical writing tool for popularizing mass education."

When the new script began to sprout in China, Mr. Cai was already very old and frail, and could not work actively. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China (1939), he became the honorary director of the Hong Kong New Script Association, but in order to get more rest, in terms of work, he had to be fully responsible by the president, Mr. Zhang Yiyi, while in terms of material, he gave a lot of help.

Now Mr. Cai has passed away. The great Mr. Cai, who worked hard for the Chinese language reform movement all his life, has passed away, leaving behind many of his unfinished works, leaving behind his spirit that will always exist. In addition to mourning, we should also continue his work, carry forward his spirit, and work hard for the Chinese language reform movement. This is to support him and commemorate him. (Que Chou)

### Chinese Artists in Hollywood

— Qiuwen

Since 1934, after Hollywood companies engaged in the large-scale production of films with Chinese themes as the background, the companies have repeatedly publicly searched for Chinese artists of various skills. The famous Chinese writer Lin Yutang and the famous photographer James Wong Howe, who studied in the United States, were the first two to be invited by MGM and Fox. Secondly, in terms of actors, in addition to Anna May Wong, there are also several people such as Kao Chung Hsia and Hong Yiping. However, it is a pity that because overseas Chinese are not interested in the film industry and neglect their work, most of them have not been valued by the company. Now I will introduce four famous Chinese artists who are currently working in various companies in Hollywood to the readers:

Lin Yutang

In January 1934, he was formally invited by MGM to join the company's screenwriting department as a consultant. Originally, after being hired, Mr. Lin expressed to the company that he thought it would be difficult to be competent for this kind of screenwriting work, and asked to be allowed to resign in a short time. However, the company authorities believed that Mr. Lin's past works were very popular among Americans, so they firmly retained him, and he is still working hard. In the previous film "The Good Earth" produced by MGM, Mr. Lin served as the consultant and the important work of revising the script. Therefore, the company authorities believed that the success of "The Good Earth" was largely due to Mr. Lin alone. Later, Mr. Lin had compiled a new script (title unknown), but unfortunately it was not approved during the review. Now we know that Mr. Lin is rewriting his sentimental biography "Six Chapters of a Floating Life", which he personally translated, for the company. This script will be completed soon. More recently, there have been rumors that Mr. Lin has returned to his motherland, but in the short term, it may be difficult to become a reality.

Anna May Wong

Anna May Wong, who used to specialize in playing the main characters in humiliating China films in Hollywood, has changed her consistent style since returning to her motherland five years ago. Because she has realized that the current motherland is no longer the motherland she imagined in the past. Her father is from Xining, Guangdong, and her mother is from Beiping. A month after the couple got married, they went to the United States to do business. At first, they opened a laundry in Los Angeles. Because they were able to endure hardship and hard work, they lived a stable life. Later, they had seven children. Miss Wong is the third. At that time, because the lives of these many children had become difficult, Anna May Wong only went to the school for a few years. At the age of sixteen, she was introduced by her cousin to work as an extra in various companies in Hollywood. Because of her own efforts, she was finally appreciated by the director, so in less than a year, she was officially hired as an actress. Her debut "The Toll of the Sea" can also be said to be the first film starring a Chinese actress in Hollywood. Now she is still affiliated with Paramount. It is said that her latest work is the legendary film "The Moon and Sixpence" starring together with Hornersk, which is expected to be transported to China for screening soon.

James Wong Howe

This famous young photographer grew up in Taishan County. He is only twenty-five years old this year, but his excellent photography skills have been praised by movie fans all over the world. He graduated from the photography department of the famous Fells Art Institute in the United States. Because of his excellent grades, he was sent to MGM by the school to serve as an intern photographer after graduation. In less than a year, he has been very proficient in the technology of film production. Now, in addition to being affiliated with MGM, he also works for Paramount, Xie Dianhua and other companies. On average, he can shoot at least five films a year.

Kao Chung Hsia

Miss Kao is from Shanghai. She used to study at Shanghai Wuben Girls' High School. Later, she went to the United States with an American friend and engaged in various theatrical activities. Because she can speak fluent English, her name has gradually been noticed by American drama fans in less than a year. The year before last, she was formally joined RKO Pictures as an actress through the introduction of a friend. In the film "The Good Earth", which the company produced last year, Miss Kao played the role of the imperial concubine. It is said that after the film was released, people could not recognize that she was a Chinese. Now Miss Kao's new works include "Carefree" and "Miracle Woman", but she is playing unimportant supporting roles. However, her name has gradually become familiar to Hollywood movie fans.

### Royal Palace Concert Notes

— Su Shaoqing

Madam Chuanyuntai, guest-starred in the Royal Palace for three days. Her play required a huqin for voice training, and I was the one playing it. Therefore, she asked me to play the zither for her for three days. To be honest, although I learned the huqin from the age of twelve and studied with the late teacher Chen Yanheng in middle age, and then studied with Mr. Sun Zuochen for five years, I rarely accompanied on stage. Now, being unable to refuse, I had to reluctantly accept the order. Mr. Sun left me a zither in his dying days, which I named Danfeng. It originally had a good sound, but the snakeskin had collapsed (the skin became loose over time, called collapsed), lacking crispness. My old friend Qian Xiusan lent me the huqin that Zuochen gave him, which I named "Thin Crane." This zither, Thin Crane, was not often played by Mr. Qian, and it also had newly replaced skin. When I played it, I couldn't grasp its personality and looked at it with great effort, like "holding a pen as thick as a rafter." This zither is like an old horse lying in its stable. Today, I should call it out for a walk, and although I am not up to the task of playing this zither, I don't care about anything else. Because I was going to perform that day, I offered Mr. Sun's posthumous zither and a portrait of my late teacher on the table in the morning, bought some fruits, made a pot of good tea, lit a few incense sticks, and bowed three times, praying: "You and the two gentlemen are separated by death, and I can only miss you in vain. Today, I, your servant, will accompany the female student Chuanyuntai on stage, drinking water and thinking of the source, I should make an offering. I hope that the two gentlemen in heaven will help me, so that I will not fail and ruin the reputation of the performance, so that the Thin Crane can cry out loudly and the zither sound will not be chaotic, so that I can thank you with a bow when the three days are over." This was the process before the performance. If I were to describe the situation at the time, on the first day, I was catching and releasing the villain in the inn. The backstage was extremely narrow, squeezed tightly. I stood for two hours, and I also had to greet everyone. I was not comfortable all over. When I got on stage, the civil and military scenes were all on the閣樓 upstairs. People backstage told me not to go up, so I sat alone on the stage, like a lone goose, far away from the sound of gongs and drums above, and not at all in sync. From the beginning of Lü Boshe's opening scene, the zither strings had been making trouble. It was not until the second scene that they were settled. The key of "A Round Bright Moon" was almost half a key too high. The strings were tight and the sound was high. The two paragraphs of the original board at the second and third watch were much faster than usual. My left and right hands felt extremely strenuous. There were no major problems on this day, probably because Chen and Sun's spirits were protecting me. On the second day, for Fish Intestine Sword, the zither sound was still good. On the third day, for Empty City Stratagem and Cutting Ma Su, I had set the correct key with a flute in advance. After a long time, the strings loosened and were not enough for the correct key. The two paragraphs "Two Countries Fight" and "The Late Emperor in Baidi City" in the first scene were not as brilliant. When it came to "I Am Originally From Wolonggang," it was long enough to be the correct key. The two-six bag cavity can be said to be innocent. Chuanyuntai was well-received. There were the most settings in this section. I am not a zither master, I am just dealing with it. If Sun and Chen knew underground, they would inevitably laugh secretly. After the three performances were completed, my courage increased from then on.

Yue Feng has become a very popular figure in the film industry today. In addition to "Loyalty and Righteousness Throughout the Ages" and "Liang Shanbo," he is also directing "Yan Xijiao" for Yi Hua. This man is managing three projects simultaneously, creating a rare high record in the directing world.

Li Pingqian's "Biography of Martyrs" is about to begin filming. The plot of this play is extremely tortuous and bizarre. The male lead has already been internally decided as Shang Meixi. The female lead has the surname Li and is named Yan Hua. She is a famous Kunqu actress from the north, just eighteen years old this year, and exceptionally beautiful.

"Taiping Great Kingdom" is a new work directed and starred by Wang Yuanlong. It goes without saying that the ideology is correct, and all the female leads in the film also have a strong sense of national consciousness, which is truly inspiring.

Chen Man's dance instructor, Violet, has joined "China Motion Picture Corporation" in Chongqing.

Yang Wenying, who played the role of Liu Xuangu in "Wensuoshen," has gone to Singapore to be a dance partner.

Jin Yan and Wang Renmei will be coming to Shanghai soon.

### Citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven (1)

Jesus's primary goal was to establish the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. His personal life and efforts towards society were all directed towards this goal. He brought a new social ideal to this world, which is the ideal of the Kingdom of Heaven. What is expressed in this new society is pure personality and loving goodwill. During his time on earth, he not only propagated this ideal but also practiced it. Even though more than 1,900 years have passed, in spirit, he still powerfully and deeply impresses this ideal upon the world. According to his teachings, people can live in an atmosphere of goodwill, and can also cultivate their personal character and a compassionate heart towards society. The church organized by Christians follows Christ's instructions. Therefore, in the eyes of observers, this church represents what Jesus called the Kingdom of Heaven. The Kingdom of Heaven has defined boundaries, a fact that many people overlook. To be a citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven, one must make oneself conform to the standards of the Kingdom of Heaven. This morning, please think about what qualities a citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven should have. To put it another way, "When can a person be considered a Christian?" In the four Gospels, Jesus used many facts to clearly reveal to us that his kingdom has various limitations. According to these limitations, many who presumptuously consider themselves citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven are actually outside the realm of the Kingdom of Heaven. Remember, once, after Jesus discussed with many leaders of the religious community in Jerusalem, one day someone came to him, praising his wisdom and knowledge. Who was this person? It was a Pharisee and scribe, who was very knowledgeable about the religion he believed in. Among all people, people thought he was someone who understood all the issues of religion. He represented a class of people who spoke in "terminology" and thought in "nouns." Because of his position, he had to understand the laws of religion and the methods of implementation. However, what did Jesus say to him? "You are not far from the kingdom of God." This sentence means that the Kingdom of Heaven has a defined realm, and this scribe is still outside the realm.
