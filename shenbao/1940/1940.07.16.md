### British Restrictions on Goods Transported to Yunnan-Burma Road: China Lodges Strong Protest with Britain; Northwest Route Transportation Expected to Become More Frequent; China and Soviet Union Relations Becoming Closer

Chongqing: Due to Japanese demands, the British government has decided to modify the passage of certain goods through Burma into China for a specific period. Upon receiving this information, the Chinese government has lodged its strongest protest with the British government. (Fifteenth dispatch)

Chongqing: Reliable sources indicate that China has lodged a strong protest with Britain regarding the Burma Road blockade, deeming it illegal. However, official circles here do not view the Burma Road blockade as a blow. According to officials, transporting goods via this route is not economical. They stated that after the blockade of the Burma Road, the import and export of goods via the Northwest Route, China's only international lifeline, would become more frequent. Furthermore, relations between China and the Soviet Union would become even closer, as the closeness between China and the Soviet Union is due to the inability of democratic nations to fully aid China. Additionally, the press is criticizing the lack of activity on the part of democratic nations. The Central Daily News harshly criticizes Britain's attitude towards the Burma Road, stating that Britain is bound by the League of Nations' resolution to aid China and is known for sincerely adhering to League of Nations resolutions. It should not engage in such contradictory actions. If Britain allows Japan's demands regarding the Burma Road, the situation will form the first step in Japan's aggression against India and Burma. The newspaper urges Britain not to fall into Japan's trap and points out that acknowledging Japan's demands means losing British prestige. (Fifteenth United Press dispatch)

Britain States the Ban Will Last Three Months

Stockholm: According to London sources, British officials deny that Britain has accepted Japan's demand to halt cargo transport on the Yunnan-Burma Road. British political figures claim it is too early to discuss a British-Japanese agreement. London believes that the issue of cargo transport on the Yunnan-Burma Road is one of the issues in British-Japanese negotiations. If Britain expresses willingness to restrict certain goods passing through Burma, it will only be a temporary measure, and Britain will still be able to act freely in the future. According to "Svenska Dagbladet," British sources state that the temporary restriction will only last for three months, coinciding with the rainy season when transportation on the Yunnan-Burma Road is difficult. London newspapers have not mentioned measures for Britain to allow the Japanese consulate in Rangoon to monitor cargo restrictions. The British government seems unwilling to publish the details of British-Japanese negotiations. (Fifteenth Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Stockholm: British radio broadcast last night regarding the negotiations between British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie and the Japanese government in recent days, denying foreign reports that Britain had accepted Japan's demand to halt the transport of munitions through Burma and Hong Kong to China. It is claimed that negotiations have not yet concluded. The British government has only agreed to various suggestions and raised some reservations. The Yunnan-Burma cargo transport issue has not yet been finally resolved, and the issue of Yunnan-Burma munitions transport is only one of the issues in the Tokyo negotiations. (Fifteenth Huitong dispatch)

London: The diplomatic correspondent of The Times claims that Washington has sent unofficial criticisms regarding Britain's temporary concessions to Japan on the issue of military equipment transport to China via the Burma Road. It should be noted that these negotiations are still in progress, and American criticisms seem to be based on inaccurate information about the negotiations. Furthermore, responsible London sources point out that these negotiations do not hinder the British government's freedom of action in the future. The British government's temporary ban on the transport of certain goods between Burma and China does not tie the hands of the British government. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)

Craigie-Arita Agreement Details

Tokyo: British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita recently finalized the details of the Burma Road blockade agreement during a two-hour discussion. It is reported that Britain is only willing to temporarily halt transportation on the Burma Road, while Japan is insisting on other demands. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has announced that today's negotiations made considerable progress and that an official announcement is expected soon. (Fifteenth United Press dispatch)

Tokyo: British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie continued negotiations with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita today regarding the Yunnan-Burma embargo issue.

### Japanese Troops in Gezhou, Eastern Guangdong, Have Been Cleared

Xingning: After defeating the Japanese near Gezhou, the Chinese troops advancing towards Chaozhou and Shantou took advantage of the victory and fiercely attacked Gezhou. At the same time, the puppet troops in the area seized the opportunity to defect and assisted the national army in fiercely attacking the Japanese from the rear. The Japanese were unable to attend to both ends and were completely annihilated by the Chinese, and countless war trophies were seized. The Japanese stationed in Dahao are extremely panicked.

### Rumors of British Mediation of the Sino-Japanese War: Chinese Officials Unaware; China Determined Not to Lay Down Arms Unless Japanese Troops Completely Withdraw

Chongqing: Official circles here are completely unaware of yesterday's broadcast speech by Jones, the Chief Administrator of Singapore. Officials say that China has been resisting for three years and is determined to move towards the final goal. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly declared this point. Any conditions that do not conform to the purpose announced by Chairman Chiang will not be considered by the Chinese government. China will not lay down its arms unless Japanese troops completely withdraw from China. (Fifteenth United Press dispatch)

London: Regarding the broadcast speech by Jones, the Acting Governor of Malaya, that the British government is now trying to promote peace between China and Japan, Reuters' diplomatic correspondent has received information from responsible sources stating that the British Foreign Office in London and British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie are currently conducting negotiations with the Japanese government. Jones was not authorized to comment on the current negotiations. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)

London: Reliable sources here are very skeptical about the news from Singapore last night that the British government is currently working hard to end the Sino-Japanese war. Jones, the Chief Administrator of Singapore, gave a broadcast last night stating that the recent British-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo regarding transportation in Burma are closely related to the British government's efforts to restore peace in China. British officials in London, speaking to United Press reporters, only expressed the hope that developments would bring the negotiations on various British-Japanese issues closer and stated that they were unaware of any Japanese peace proposals to China being conveyed through British diplomats. The Chinese Embassy here also believes that the National Government in Chongqing has not received such peace proposals. Responsible British sources here have repeatedly stated that the British government will naturally mediate if both China and Japan want Britain to assume the role of mediator, but Jones' broadcast speech seems to exaggerate the facts. It must be understood that the British Empire is ruled from London, not Singapore. Authoritative sources have given the following four explanations to United Press reporters regarding Britain's position on the Sino-Japanese war: (1) Britain only hopes to resolve various British-Japanese issues in further discussions. (2) Britain, being preoccupied with Europe, cannot independently take a strong stance to deal with Japan's actions in China. (3) Germany clearly hopes that a dispute will arise between Britain and Japan, and Britain must guard against this. (4) Britain's permission to ban the transport of munitions via the Burma Road should not be considered a blow to China, as the ban is limited to the three months of the rainy season, and the actual amount of transportation at that time is only one-tenth of the amount of transportation at other times. Officials also said that the Burma Road issue alone cannot be used as an excuse to create a British-Japanese war. (Fifteenth United Press dispatch)

Singapore: The Acting Governor of Malaya, Jones, revealed in a broadcast speech last night the government's efforts to promote peace between China and Japan. It is claimed that the British and Japanese governments are currently discussing certain proposals made by Japan regarding the war with China. The British government believes that the true desire of the people of both China and Japan is for a glorious peace, so it will do its best to avoid assisting and prolonging the war in the East and will make all possible efforts to end it. The results will soon be clear. In this war where Britain is fighting alone against the enemy, it has to make various efforts and all sacrifices in order to achieve the final victory over Germany, as this victory is the only hope for saving civilization. Britain will do everything possible to cope with this most brutal war in history. Britain is saddened to see China and Japan (former allies of the British Empire) at war with each other. The British government earnestly hopes to find a solution to the opinions between these two great nations as soon as possible. If these peace efforts fail, then the British and the British Empire's goal of defeating the enemies of the whole world (i.e., Germany ruled by Hitler) will not be distracted. Britain must concentrate everything on the struggle in order to win this war, and will not hesitate to temporarily sacrifice many of the wills in its heart. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)

Rumors of Trautmann's Return to Chongqing Also Seeking Mediation

Hong Kong: According to reports from Chongqing, Dr. Trautmann, the German ambassador to China who has been staying in his home country for the past two years, has recently returned to Chongqing to end the "China Incident," so that Japan can become an ally of Germany and be able to freely seize the colonies of European countries in the Far East. It is reported that Germany has made three conditions to Japan: (1) Japan must not occupy Vietnam, (2) Japan should participate in the war before the current German blitzkrieg against Britain has begun, and (3) the Japanese Navy should concentrate in Tokyo Bay so that it can attack the Malay Peninsula or the Dutch East Indies. Well-informed foreign sources here cannot confirm or deny the above rumors. However, rumors here that Hitler is putting pressure on Chongqing and Tokyo to end the war in China so that Japan is not constrained and can oppose Britain in the Far East have been circulating for some time. The authorities who are now sparing no effort to defend Hong Kong believe that this is quite likely to happen. A government spokesman mentioned the issue of Japan assisting Germany in the war when explaining why British women and children were being evacuated from Hong Kong. According to other sources, although Japan has sent its former Foreign Minister to Berlin to try to forge ties with Germany, there may not be any results. Germany wants to deal with the colonies in the Far East on its own and does not allow Japan to interfere. Moreover, the Germans have never forgotten Japan's seizure of Qingdao in the last war. As for ending the war in China, in addition to Germany's efforts, it is reported that Dr. Stuart, the president of Yenching University, is also mediating. He stayed in Chongqing in March and April of this year, reportedly for this matter. Dr. Stuart is highly respected by the Japanese army in North China, and the Chongqing government also has great faith in him. American diplomats in China also maintain close contact with him. It is reported that he has proposed to Chongqing the basic principles of peace talks, namely, restoring the situation before the July 7th Incident, while Chongqing has requested restoring the situation before the September 18th Incident, resulting in a stalemate. Competent observers here unanimously believe that if Japan is not constrained by the Sino-Japanese War, it may have already taken more severe measures against the Dutch East Indies, the Malay Peninsula, and Vietnam. If Japan can immediately end its war with China, it may still be able to do so in time. (Fifteenth International News Agency dispatch)

Editorial

### The Rumor of British Mediation Between China and Japan

Yesterday, it was reported that Mr. Jones, the British Governor of Singapore, broadcast that the UK is making the most sincere efforts to bring about peace between China and Japan. He did not specify how the UK is trying, but he said "The British Government is determined to avoid doing anything to endorse or prolong the war in the Far East and is determined to exert every effort to achieve this end; As to the outcome, we shall soon know. If it is possible to obtain a solution which is acceptable to both sides, that will be a welcome thing; If these efforts fail, the world will know that the UK's greatest goal is to defeat Germany, and shall not divert attention and purpose because of any other fact." Mr. Jones also explained that the current Sino-British talks in Tokyo on the issue of transport in the Yunnan-Burma Road are in fact related to the UK's efforts to end the Sino-Japanese war; He also said that "China and Japan have been good friends of the UK in the past, and the British government earnestly hopes to promote the possible resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute as soon as possible." Regardless of whether the Governor of Singapore broadcast such a thing, whether we can affirm this telegram is likely to subtly express the thoughts of some British people.

In this telegram, it explains that certain British people in the current period of war against Germany, in addition to dealing with Germany, the profit and harm in the Far East, and even the right and wrong of the Far East, are not bothered to be consulted; and it implies that as long as it is beneficial to his handling of Germany, there is nothing else to worry about. This telegram seems to indicate that the unimpeded transport on the Yunnan-Burma Road is actually related to the continuation of the Sino-Japanese War; and certain British people now do not want China and Japan to continue the war.

Assuming that the thoughts of the British people are indeed as described above, there are two very surprising things. First, although the UK is not willing to withdraw from the Far East, and very much desires to maintain its position and interests in the Far East through mediation of Sino-Japanese peace; however, for the sake of fighting Germany, even if it is necessary to withdraw from the Far East to the greatest extent, there is no objection. The telegram conveyed by Mr. Jones that the UK will never divert its greatest goal of fighting Germany because of any other fact is truly a "very generous and great" expression for the Far East! Second, the transport on the Yunnan-Burma Road, although China believes it has the right to demand its maintenance, does not consider it related to the lifeline of the War of Resistance, but in the minds of certain British people, the value of the Yunnan-Burma Road is overestimated, as it is actually a winding path of no more than three or five feet wide and carrying no more than a few tons. His transportation and supply is regarded as being able to maintain a battlefront stretching for five thousand miles. If such an erroneous estimate is not made, why would there be the suspicion of intimidation from the side and say that Tokyo's negotiations on the Yunnan-Burma Road are intended to strive to end the Sino-Japanese War?

The surprises that certain British people are giving us now can also be said to be not unprecedented. They are now making an erroneous estimate of the Yunnan-Burma Road, and they had even greater errors in the past; that is, they did not accurately estimate the significance of Japan's invasion of China, so Simon rejected Stimson's cooperation. Compared before and after, there is no need to be surprised! Under the "appeasement first" doctrine of former British Prime Minister Chamberlain, he disregarded everything and put his handprint in Munich; under the "Germany First" doctrine of the current Prime Minister Churchill, who knows whether he will disregard everything again and negotiate in Tokyo. At the time of the Munich compromise, Britain sacrificed its own international morality and also sacrificed Czechoslovakia, and the consequences were that Britain lost all its allies and is now fighting alone; if Britain sacrifices its own international morality and makes others generous in the current Tokyo negotiations, then the consequences will be that Britain's credibility in the Far East will fall to the ground, and it will eventually withdraw from the Far East. Compared with each other, there is no need to be surprised!

As for the mediation of Sino-Japanese peace that certain British people want to strive for, let us assume that the UK is doing it not only for its own war against Germany, but also out of good intentions because it subjectively recognizes China and Japan as its friends; However, objectively, it is by no means the case. Because Japan has not yet respected China's sovereignty, territorial, administrative independence, integrity of provincial realization, there is no room for China to accept mediation; not only that, the British style of mediation has the possibility of making Japan's aggressive arrogance even higher, and gives Japan a more extensive opportunity to manipulate between the UK and Germany in international diplomacy. This is not an excited statement! But looking at the issue of the transport of the Yunnan-Burma Road, Japan's ambassador to the UK said that if the UK does not accept the demands of the Japanese government, then the radical elements pro-German in Tokyo will rise to the top; isn't this a confession that is intended to manipulate between the UK and Germany? Looking at the argument that Japan requires the UK to block the Yunnan-Burma Road is to prevent all countries from assisting the National Government of China, so as to end the so-called China Incident as soon as possible; isn't this conclusive evidence of the intention to complete military aggression? We can see through that the Chinese government and people, in maintaining the independence and integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration, have nothing else to ask for, and under this premise, they will never refuse everything; whoever can complete this premise, and welcomes everything; Therefore, if the UK assumes that there is any goodwill, the Chinese government and people should have no prejudice, but if the premise is not established, then nothing will be accomplished! If the UK, or any party, cannot grasp this premise, then it will inevitably lead to wasting effort!

### Two Pieces of Zhang Zizhong's Testament Encouraging Subordinates to Sacrifice for the Country

Fancheng: General Commander Zhang Zizhong, in recent years, has defended the country and resisted foreign aggression in the Ezhong area, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's advance and achieving extraordinary feats. Last year, he annihilated over ten thousand Japanese soldiers on the Jingzhong Road. In the recent Henan-Hubei campaign, he personally led his troops, fiercely attacking the Japanese army between Hongshan, Zaoyang, and the Han River, for over half a month, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. On May 16th, Zhang led a portion of a certain division in pursuit of the retreating Japanese army. During the heat of battle, in close combat, many subordinates advised him to withdraw, but Zhang refused, still personally leading his troops in a charge. Unexpectedly, the Japanese took him from behind, causing Zhang to fall into the enemy's ranks. Nevertheless, he engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese, killing countless numbers. Unfortunately, he was struck by a bullet in a vital area, and valiantly sacrificed himself at Nanguadian, near Zhangjiaji, on the western foothills of Dabie Mountain. After his death, there was a torrential downpour, as if the heavens were mourning. Before leading his troops to attack the Japanese on May 8th, Zhang had personally written to a certain deputy commander, including a long letter encouraging his subordinates, his determination to sacrifice for the country, and absolute obedience to the leader's commands, filling every line. Now, having obtained the original text of the two letters, they are transcribed as follows:

A letter to a certain commander states: "Tong Linge and Zhao Dengyu died in Nanyuan, and Song Zheyuan also died in Sichuan. Only you, me, Liu Ruming, Shi Yousan, and a few others remain. We do not know when we too will part forever. We should immediately make a decision, before we die, to exert our greatest efforts for the country and the nation, never stopping until death. In this way, even if we meet in the underworld after death, we will surely be joyous and encouraged, without any shame."

A letter to his subordinates states: "Regarding the matter at hand, you and I have two paths to take. The first is to be perfunctory, everyone being perfunctory, everything being perfunctory. I am perfunctory towards you, and you are perfunctory towards your subordinates. Before the enemy comes, we arrange defenses in a perfunctory manner. When the Japanese come, we resist in a perfunctory manner. We retreat after a perfunctory effort. This approach may seem clever, but it is actually the most foolish. It may seem easy, but it is actually more difficult. It may seem cheap, but it is actually more costly. Because if we don't fight today, we will still have to fight tomorrow. If we don't fight in the front, we will still have to fight wherever we retreat. The sacrifice will be the same, but we will only earn the disapproval of our superiors. Therefore, the result of this path will inevitably be disgrace and ruin. Not only will the country be ruined at our hands, but the lives of future generations will also be forfeited by us. This is equivalent to suicide, so this path is a dead end, a path of decline and destruction. You and I have shared life and death, shared hardships for more than a decade, our bond stronger than flesh and blood, our loyalty heavier than brotherhood. I cannot bear to let you take this path of destruction. You have always understood the greater good, understood the greater righteousness, and I believe you will certainly not take this path. We only have one other path to take, which is to fight. Since we have been ordered to defend this line, we are determined to fight on this line. Rather than retreating and still having to fight, we might as well fight on this line with value and meaning. This time, we must fight the Japanese to the end on this line, finishing the fight, and not retreating without orders. You and I have been supported by the country for decades. No matter how difficult, can we not fight? Fortunately, if our fight can stop the Japanese, then not only a few of us, but our entire army will surely enjoy supreme glory in the Republic of China. Our officers and soldiers will forever maintain a glorious position. In the unlikely event that we fight to the end, you and I will still be worthy of the country, worthy of the 400 million compatriots, fathers, and elders. We will not have betrayed their support, and we will not be ashamed to be soldiers for life. Therefore, this path is a path of integrity, the only path we should take. You and I have endured countless hardships since joining the war of resistance. Now we have reached the final stage. 'Building a mountain, piling nine loads of earth, how can we bear to fall short by one basket?' Therefore, I can only hope that you will steel your spirits, grit your teeth, inspire your subordinates, and fight this battle. Whether we are regarded as men or ghosts in China in the future will be determined in this battle." Zhang Zizhong bows. (14th Dispatch)

### Air Battle Over the English Channel: British Air Force Achieves Another Victory; British Communiqu√© Claims Seven German Planes Shot Down; British Destroyer Escort Sunk by Torpedo

London: The British Air Force has achieved unprecedented victories in the past week in defending British airspace against attacking German planes. Yesterday, British fighters engaged in a terrifying air battle with German planes over the English Channel off the southeastern coast of England, shooting down at least seven German planes. Yesterday, German planes attacked British ships and the coast but were driven back by British planes. It is reported that a total of twelve German planes were destroyed and several were damaged. The British fighters lost a total of three planes. An eyewitness stated that when German bombers attacked a convoy off the coast, anti-aircraft guns opened fire, and British fighters also pounced on the German planes. The air battle then began. Shells exploded in the air, white smoke dotted the sky, and the sound of machine guns mingled with the buzzing of planes. It was seen that British fighters shot down at least four German bombers and drove the German planes back across the Channel. One German bomber plunged into the sea in flames, and the pilot parachuted out at an altitude of one thousand feet and fell into the sea. Spitfire British planes chased two German bombers into the sea, and the air battle ended. It is believed that the British planes shot down one of the German planes and then chased the other. At the end of the week, British planes continued to attack German military targets and targets in German-occupied areas, without any sign of relaxation. (15th Reuters Dispatch)

### Churchill's Broadcast: Reiterating the Belief in War; The Tragedy of the Anglo-French Navy Comes to an End; Resolving to Destroy the Strong Enemy with All Our Strength

London: Prime Minister Churchill broadcast to the nation last night, saying that in the past half month, the British Navy, in addition to blockading the remaining German fleet and pursuing the Italian fleet, also took on the painful duty of preventing the main French warships from participating in the war. According to the Franco-German armistice agreement, the French fleet must be placed under German power. If this were to happen, it would endanger the security of Britain and the United States. Therefore, we had no other choice but to take the immediate action that we have already taken. This painful task has now been completed. Although the incompletely equipped battleship Jean Bart is now moored in a certain port in Morocco, and some French warships are also moored in Toulon and French ports around the world, these warships are not enough to disrupt the superiority of British naval power. If these French warships do not intend to sail to German or Italian ports, we will not bother them. This tragedy in Anglo-French relations has now come to an end. Now, let us speak of the future.

Deeply Moved by the Fate of France

Today is July 14th, the French National Day. On this day last year, I visited the military parade of the French Army in Paris, and the military appearance was indeed very prosperous. Who could have predicted the changes in one year? And who can predict the changes in the next few years? We stand in awe before the unfolding of human destiny. Trust is assistance and comfort. I dare to announce my trust: we will eventually see a liberated France re-celebrate July 14th in its greatness and glory, and once again be a defender of freedom and justice for mankind. This day will inevitably come. At that time, the French soul will return to the French people who have not been disappointed by the Republic in this dark period. At this time, we do not want to waste precious words. When our friends fighting alongside us are hit and fall, what we have to pay attention to is that the sharp weapon in the hands of this friend must not fall into the hands of the enemy. We should not harbor resentment because of the delirium and painful posture of our friends, but we must work to restore their health. The common interests between Britain and France still exist today. The dual principles and their inevitable responsibilities also exist. If our path to victory is not obstructed, we are prepared to exercise good will towards the French government to the extent possible, encourage trade for French territories that have not broken away from France but maintain their freedom, and assist in their administration. Our war against Hitler is as much a need as iron. We should strive to make the true French people responsive to our method of struggle. Every victory of Britain is a step towards the liberation of Europe from its shackles. Not only France, but also the oppressed countries of Europe will have this feeling.

The Battle Will Be Protracted and Difficult

Judging from various phenomena, this battle will last for quite a long time and will also be difficult. No one can know the extent of the spread of war. However, one thing can be asserted: the people of Europe will never be subjected to Nazi brutal rule for long, and the world will never succumb to Hitler's rule. Now we are dealing with the difficult situation alone. We trust the true master and are confident that our will is unyielding, ready to defend our territory against aggression. Although we are fighting alone, we are not fighting only for ourselves. In this haven gathered for the progress and civilization of mankind, with warships cruising the seas and airplanes covering the skies, we are now waiting for the enemy's attack without any fear. The enemy's attack may be seen tonight, or it may wait until next week, or it may never materialize. We must show the ability to cope with a sudden fierce attack or a long-term struggle. However, no matter how long the war lasts, we will never seek peace or allow negotiations. We can show grace, but we will never beg for grace. Sympathetic observers outside the Atlantic and friends in European countries not yet afflicted by disaster, who do not deeply understand our source of goods and determination, are worried about the survival of Britain because they have seen many countries broken by Nazi forces in a matter of weeks or days. But it must be known that Hitler has not yet encountered a major country with extremely firm willpower. The countries he broke before were mostly poisoned by conspiracy and spies before being overthrown by violence, first rotting internally and then suffering external blows. If not, how can the experience of France, its army, its people, and its leaders be explained? As for our country, it is sound and unharmed. Hitler prepared a plan to destroy his neighbors with scientific precision, treating Poland, Norway, Denmark, Holland, and Belgium one by one in the same way. Even France was destroyed by him. From this, we can know that Hitler has also been planning for years to destroy Britain, which he sees as his main enemy, and has devised a plan to destroy Britain completely. What I can say now is that any plan Hitler has devised for the invasion of Britain in the past two and a half years must now be completely transformed to respond to our new situation. Two months ago, our first and foremost effort was to place the most elite army and all the ordnance in France, and most of our air force had to be sent to France to prepare for war. But now all these forces are in the country. The army standing guard on the British Isles tonight, its number, its equipment, and its disturbance, are unprecedented in the last or this war. Today we have 1.5 million people holding weapons in anticipation, and in June and July, we have seen great progress in their organization, defense, and combat power every week. In the shortest time, there has been such a great change. We cannot praise our military and civilians enough. After the regular army, there are tools to destroy paratroopers and air raiders and clear out internal traitors. I do not believe that there are many internal traitors in the country. If there are any, they will die by their own hands. After the regular army, we still have more than a million defense volunteers, most of whom are veterans of the last battle and are eager to inflict heavy blows on the enemy wherever they appear. If the enemy does invade Britain, the people will never passively lay down their arms and surrender to the enemy as other countries have done. We will defend each village, each town, each city. And the people of London will constantly engage in street battles, not afraid of swallowing up the entire enemy army. We would rather see London turned to ashes than see London be dominated by people in a submissive and cowardly state, like slaves. We have to state this matter because there is a need to reassure the people by explaining our intentions.

The British Air Force Has Made Outstanding Achievements

This week has been a week of outstanding achievements for the British Air Force. The number of German planes disrupting the convoy in the Channel that have been shot down compared to the number of British planes lost is a ratio of five to one. This is only the beginning of a larger war in the future. Although we still hope that the future results can be seen better than this, we can be very comforted by this result at present. The British Navy has a thousand armed warships patrolling the seas, spreading authority far and wide, able to quickly protect any threatened area and maintain British traffic to the New World, and the supply from the New World to Britain is now increasing with the war situation. Enemy submarines and planes have been conducting unrestricted attacks on our commerce for more than ten months, but our stock of food is now more than before, and our ship tonnage is now higher than at the beginning of the war. Is this not very different? However, our efforts will not be slackened by this. We must double our efforts, not only preparing for the summer, but also preparing for the winter, not only preparing for 1941, but also preparing for 1942. By then, I hope that the war situation will be different from the form of attack that we have to adopt at present.

Preparing for War to the Utmost

The reason why I have described in detail the elements of our firepower and the resources of our mobilization and control is to show that our war is justified and we can obtain the tools for survival. We are now managing arduously in a dark period and will eventually see the dawn. As the head of a government representing all parties and all classes of the country, supported by a free parliament and a free press, there is one point on which we are united: that is, we are prepared to fight to the utmost. This is the only way for the country to maintain its freedom and support its doctrine. I hope that the British people all over the world and those who feel good about us can do their best, give up everything, and persevere to the end. This is not a struggle between tribal chiefs or kings or dynasties, but a war of nameless heroes, who are loyal and dedicated to their duties, but whose names are not known and whose deeds are not recorded. We should each be faithful to our beliefs and fulfill our responsibilities, so that Hitler's poisonous flames can eventually be extinguished in our time. (Reuters, 15th)

### American Newspapers Praise Churchill's Speech

This is the voice of a free people, prepared to suffer all kinds of pain to protect freedom. The New York Herald Tribune also commented on the British Prime Minister's speech, saying that there was not a single word showing weakness. (Reuters, 15th)

Washington: People all over the United States listened attentively to Prime Minister Churchill's speech last night. People agreed with the Prime Minister's statement that Britain is sound and will not be internally corrupted like France. The numbers of the army and navy and the facts about shipping and food reported by the Prime Minister, in the eyes of the public, are to refute the recent boast of Germany's victory in submarines. The public regards the Prime Minister's statement that he must defend London, even if it is necessary to fight street by street, as not being empty words. (Reuters, 15th)

### Romanian Government Strives to Develop Agriculture

### The Democratic National Convention in the United States Officially Opens Yesterday Afternoon; Roosevelt Expresses the Conditions for Re-election; Reserving the Right to Choose the Vice President

Chicago: The 28th Democratic National Convention has been held today, and it will set an unprecedented precedent by re-electing President Roosevelt, allowing him to serve a third consecutive term in the White House. At the same time, the leaders who support the New Deal have made it impossible for the party chairman Farley to control President Roosevelt's third term bid, and they clearly oppose Farley's third term. It is rumored that Farley will resign from President Roosevelt's cabinet today, resign from his position as Postmaster General, and will be absent from the position of National Democratic Party Chairman. According to people close to Farley, Farley may take up the position of chairman of a business association. Farley still refused to report his future policy to the press last night, but said that from now on, most of the representatives have expressed their willingness to re-elect President Roosevelt, but his name may be proposed to the conference as one of the participants in the election. Last night, there were many rumors about Vice President Garner's plan. Some said that Garner was unwilling to accept the election of Vice President, and some said that Garner was extremely eager to get the position of President again. Garner is also a person with presidential ambition, and his name may be proposed to the conference by the representatives from Texas. (Central News Agency, 15th)

Chicago: The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to open here this afternoon. The meeting procedures have been prepared. Yesterday, President Roosevelt was sailing on the Potomac River. However, the President is only superficially isolated from the political situation. Commerce Minister Hopkins, who is President's close friend and the most intimate political assistant, is now handling President's affairs at the conference, and Hopkins has also installed a special telephone line directly to the White House. The movement to nominate President Roosevelt for a third term has been spreading across the country for several months and is now intensifying. This move has at least gained President Roosevelt's passive consent. The first vote will be held on Thursday, and the President may get about 90% of the votes at that time. If Roosevelt refuses to accept, he will be the first person in American history to refuse to be a presidential candidate. According to very accurate political observers, the President will accept because the nominators are truly automatically pushing him out, and will "sacrifice" himself and compete again. There are three reasons: (1) This is the will of the people; (2) The new measures are threatened by Willkie (Republican candidate for President); (3) He can lead the country through an unprecedented international emergency with experienced means. Some observers believe that in order to comply with the traditional practice of not serving three consecutive terms, the President may explain that he will resign after the country safely passes the world crisis, so that the Vice President can succeed him. According to Washington's expectations, after the Democratic National Convention nominates President Roosevelt, the aid-to-Britain movement will accelerate. Most of the internal and external policies that may cause disputes have recently been delayed due to political sources. However, the assistance that has already been given to Britain will continue to be provided. According to those in charge, four out of every five airplanes now being made in the United States will be shipped to Britain. This is an example of the United States continuing to aid Britain. (Reuters, 15th)

Chicago: President Roosevelt said today that he has the strongest supporters, which is what previous American presidents did not have. He then stated the conditions under which he would be willing to serve a third term as President. The President's advisors informed the Democratic leaders of Roosevelt's conditions last night. The content is reportedly as follows: (1) The President's re-election to a third term as President must be unopposed; (2) His name cannot be used for promotion; (3) The right to reserve the selection of the Vice President. Democratic leaders have not yet expressed whether they will allow this major request, but it is believed that they will be able to comply, so as to achieve victory in mid-November. (International News Agency, 15th)

Washington: President Roosevelt has not yet taken any action on whether to participate in the third election. The President has just returned to the White House from the Potomac. He has not issued any speeches or announcements regarding the political situation or his future policies. However, today the Democratic leaders in this area and Chicago all believe that President Roosevelt may accept the nomination of the Democratic Party this week. (United Press International, 15th)

### U.S. Department of Commerce Financial Division Announces Total Investment in the Far East, Including China, Japan, and the Philippines, Totals Over 700 Million Yuan, Less Than 7% of Total Foreign Investment

Washington ‚Äì The Financial Division of the U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced that the total U.S. investment in the Far East is less than 7% of the total U.S. foreign investment.

### Japan Closes off Zhejiang and Fujian Coasts Under Pretext of "Military Necessity," Aiming to Exclude Third-Party Trade; British Authorities Have Lodged Strong Protests

Vice Admiral Shigematsu Shimada, commander of the Japanese fleet in China, under the pretext of "military necessity," suddenly announced at 10:00 AM this morning the closure of the coastal ports of Xiangshanpu, Wenzhou, Sandu'ao, and Fuzhou in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, effective today. It is claimed that this is "to prevent third countries from using these routes to transport arms to aid China after the blockade of Vietnam." In reality, it is another act of aggression aimed at excluding third-party trade with China and disrupting the Chinese people. It is reported that Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Yoshiaki Miura, has already notified the relevant authorities and customs of various countries in this port of this notice, forcing British ships traveling to Fuzhou, Shantou, Wenzhou, and Ningbo to cease operations.

All Ports in South China Blockaded

According to the notice issued by Fleet Commander Shimada, from midnight on July 15th, all ships are prohibited from entering the following areas, and ships that violate or attempt to enter will be detained by naval forces. The Japanese Navy will not be responsible for any direct or indirect damage to personnel or ships entering or leaving the area after the specified date and time. The blockaded areas are: (1) The waters of Xiangshanpu in Hangzhou Bay, including the line connecting Xushan and the Xihuoshan Island lighthouse, the north-south line passing through Shenjiamen in the Zhoushan Islands, and the east-west line passing through the southern tip of Liuheng Island; (2) Wenzhou Port and its surrounding waters and Yueqing Bay, including the line connecting Nanpaishan and the eastern end of Dongtoushan Island, and the east-west line passing through Banmianshan; (3) Sandu'ao and Luoyuan Bay, west of the 340-degree line passing through Beijiaozui; (4) Fuzhou Port and its surrounding waters, including the north-south line passing through Dinghai and the 45-degree line passing through Black Head.

Recent Situation of Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping

Since the authorities allowed small ships to enter the Zhenhai Estuary blockade line on the Shanghai-Ningbo route to load and unload passengers and goods on the Jiangbei shore, direct voyages have been convenient. The Gaodeng and Changde ships were the first to operate, followed by Shantai, Ruitai, Haifu, Aweima Li, and other ships. Recently, the Jiangding and Jiangsu ships have joined the route, bringing the total number of ships operating direct voyages on the Shanghai-Ningbo route to eight. The Deping and Moufu ships operate on the Shanghai-Zhenhai route. The Deping ship entered the dock for repairs at the end of last month and has not yet been completed, so only the Moufu ship operates on the Shanghai-Zhenhai route, with a schedule of one trip every six days. It is expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow and sail to Zhenhai on the 17th.

Temporary Suspension of Flights and Passengers Leaving Ships

Yesterday, there were four ships traveling direct on the Shanghai-Ningbo route: the Ruitai ship of the Hualun Shipping Company, the Aweima Li ship of the Guo Side Shipping Company, the Changde ship of the Luo Kezhi Shipping Company, and the British-owned Jiangsu ship managed by Taichangxiang. Yesterday afternoon, passengers boarded the ships and goods were being loaded when they suddenly received notification from their respective companies to suspend sailings to Ningbo. The passengers were stunned and work stopped immediately. Passengers questioned the crew about the reason for not departing, and were generally told that Ningbo's Zhenhai Estuary was blockaded and that sailings were temporarily suspended, or that sailings would resume in a day or two. The passengers reluctantly carried their suitcases and returned to their residences.

Customs Notification Prohibiting Sailing to Ningbo

Yesterday was the first time the Jiangsu ship was operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo direct route, but it unexpectedly faced a temporary suspension. As for the reason for the temporary suspension of the ships sailing to Ningbo, the company claimed that they received a notice from the customs commissioner at around 4:00 PM yesterday, temporarily prohibiting sailing to Ningbo.

British Authorities Closely Watching

The English-language North China Daily News stated that Vice Admiral Shigematsu Shimada, commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet in China, issued a notice at 10:00 AM this morning (15th), stating that due to "military necessity," all ships, including those of third countries, are prohibited from entering or leaving the areas of Hangzhou Bay, Wenzhou Port, Sandu'ao, and Fuzhou Bay along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, in order to cut off the routes supplying the central government from Vietnam and Burma.

The Japanese Navy will not be held directly or indirectly responsible for any losses incurred by ships entering or leaving the above areas from midnight on the 15th. This notice was delivered by Vice Admiral Shimada to the consulates of various countries and the Jianghai Customs through Japanese Consul General Miura. It is reported that the Japanese side has ordered British ships to leave Fuzhou, Sandu'ao, Wenzhou, and Ningbo, and to cease sailing to these ports, as the Japanese side will begin operations against these ports tomorrow (16th). This afternoon, according to the British naval authorities in Shanghai, the matter is under consideration, but the notice received was too brief to make a clear statement. Colonel James, the British coastal liaison officer in Shanghai, said that he is studying the contents of the Japanese announcement and will visit Japanese officials this afternoon.

Foreign Merchants Gather to Discuss Protests

The Japanese side's sudden announcement of the blockade of the Zhejiang and Fujian coastal routes has caused great alarm in the shipping industry in this port. The ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Fujian routes are all owned by third-country shipping companies, and operating along the Chinese coast is permitted under international law and should not be interfered with by any country. Yesterday, the Japanese naval authorities warned foreign ships to cease operations, hindering the legitimate business of foreign merchants. Therefore, the authorities of these shipping companies are currently trying to gather together and request that their respective consulates in Shanghai file serious protests with the Japanese side.

British Authorities File Protests

A message from the British Embassy in this port was recently released, as follows: The Japanese naval authorities issued a notice yesterday that they intend to take action against the coastal ports of China (Wenzhou, Ningbo, Santiao (transliteration), Fuzhou) on July 16th. The British authorities have filed protests with the Japanese side, stating that the notice issued is incomplete and declaring that the Japanese naval authorities will be fully responsible for all losses or damages suffered by British ships as a result of the Japanese actions. The British authorities also protested that the areas mentioned in the Japanese notice include several important anchorages for ships to take shelter from storms, and that as the hurricane season is currently underway, ships may need to sail to these anchorages to take shelter from the wind. Therefore, the British authorities will also hold the Japanese authorities fully responsible for any losses or damages suffered by British ships due to the inability to take shelter from the wind.

### Sauce and Wine Industry Association Sets Deadline for Verifying Measuring Instruments

The Shanghai Sauce and Wine Industry Association, in light of the inevitable reduction in capacity of measuring instruments used by members of the industry, held a special meeting and resolved that all measuring instruments used by members must be verified by the association, starting with the French Concession and then extending to the International Settlement. The verification period for members in the French Concession is limited to the 20th of this month. If existing measuring instruments are deemedÂêàÊ†º by the association after verification, they may continue to be used after being stamped by the association; otherwise, they must be replaced. It is now reported that standard measuring instruments have been approved by the French Concession Price Equalization Committee and have been forwarded to the police department for reference. Once the verification of measuring instruments is completed, the association will report daily market prices. From then on, the market prices of measuring instruments in the sauce and wine industry will be consistent.

### Peace Rumors Abound Again; Latest Telegram from London Denies the Matter

Yesterday afternoon, a United Press report from Singapore stated that Singapore Administrator Jones broadcast on the evening of the 14th that the United Kingdom was currently "making its most sincere efforts to promote peace between China and Japan." At the same time, an International News Service report from Hong Kong stated that the German ambassador had returned to Chongqing and was rumored to be willing to mediate the Sino-Japanese war. Various news reports arrived suddenly. All sectors in this port, having repeatedly refuted peace rumors in the past, and the government having clarified its national policy and proven with facts that they were purely rumors, are extremely steadfast in their resolve. Only the market slightly fluctuated due to these rumors, but quickly returned to normal. By last night, a United Press report from London stated that the Chinese Embassy in London also believed that the Chongqing National Government had never received such peace proposals, and believed that Jones' broadcast seemed to overstate the facts. At the same time, the information office of the British Embassy in this port indicated that it was not necessary to pay too much attention to what Jones said, as what he said was merely restating his long-held wishes. According to inquiries made to the German Embassy in this port, German Information Officer Kord stated that "the so-called Ambassador Trautmann has returned to Chongqing to make 'Sino-Japanese peace' efforts" is not true. It seems that the aforementioned rumors cannot be confirmed by the official representatives of England and Germany in Shanghai.

### Japanese Military Police Incident Nearing Resolution; Americans and Japanese Scuffle Again; Occurred in the Oriental Caf√©; Cause Still Unknown

The case of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment detaining sixteen Japanese military police has been resolved through repeated negotiations between the United States and Japan. The "insult" case has come to an end. At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, Japanese military police commander Miura met with Colonel Baker again to discuss a solution. It was rumored that a joint statement from both sides, though not released as scheduled yesterday, was expected to be announced in the near future. Unexpectedly, just as one wave subsided, another rose. Around 11:00 PM the night before, a conflict occurred between soldiers of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment and Japanese residents in the Oriental Caf√© on Metcalfe Road. Two Japanese residents were seriously injured. The U.S. naval authorities are investigating the details of the incident, and the police authorities of the Japanese consulate have already released an account of the events. The future development of this matter is currently unknown. It is generally believed that if the Japanese residents and soldiers in Shanghai continue to act as if they are "victors," then under this kind of self-intoxicated "sense of superiority," there will be endless troubles and no peace.

Japanese Side Releases Preliminary Information

The English-language North China Daily News stated that at 11:00 PM last night (14th), three uniformed soldiers of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment and two Japanese civilians scuffled in the Oriental Caf√© on Metcalfe Road. It is reported that the Japanese were all seriously injured. U.S. military officers are investigating the incident this morning (15th). The police department of the Japanese consulate released preliminary information on the matter, stating that several Japanese were drinking in the Oriental Caf√© last night when three U.S. soldiers entered, appearing to be drunk. A fight broke out, the cause of which is unknown. Eventually, both sides left the caf√©, apparently resolving the matter themselves. Ten minutes later, two Japanese employees of a certain textile factory entered the Oriental Caf√© and sat down to drink when the three U.S. soldiers returned and scuffled with the two Japanese again. The cause is also unknown. The two Japanese suffered serious injuries to their faces and were also severely cut. The U.S. and Japanese authorities are currently continuing to investigate the case and have not yet released an official statement. It is noted that about three months ago, a Japanese man was stabbed in the back in the Oriental Caf√©, allegedly by a British soldier from the West Fife Light Infantry. This caused a serious reaction at the time. Regarding the case of the U.S. soldiers arresting sixteen Japanese military police on July 7th, Major General Miura, commander of the Japanese military police in Shanghai, and Colonel Baker, commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment, met again this morning to study the joint statement that will be released. Officials indicated that the statement will likely be released tomorrow morning (16th).

Private Quarrel Not Likely to Escalate

According to another Western source, a Japanese spokesperson stated in the press room yesterday that the Japanese authorities consider the quarrel between U.S. naval soldiers and Japanese residents that occurred in the Oriental Caf√© on Metcalfe Road at 11:30 PM on Sunday to be purely a private disturbance caused by drunkenness and not worthy of attention. It appears that the incident occurred when U.S. naval soldiers quarreled with Japanese, but the matter subsided after they left. Later, two more Japanese entered the caf√©, and the U.S. naval soldiers returned as well. For unknown reasons, a quarrel broke out again, and the Japanese were struck in the head and shoulders with bottles, requiring two weeks to recover from their injuries. The Japanese consular police are currently investigating the matter, and the authorities of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment are also investigating the truth.

### Recent Situation of the Yunnan-Vietnam Transportation Route; Michelin Express Not Operating; Bridge at Majie Station Interrupted

After the resumption of shipping on the Shanghai-Haiphong route, the transportation of goods to the interior via Vietnam has been temporarily suspended. Therefore, there are no goods on ships traveling from Shanghai to Haiphong. According to a travel agency, recent news on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is as follows:

Express Train Suspended

The bridge attached to Majie Station, 34 kilometers north of Hekou on the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, has been damaged and has not yet been repaired. Therefore, the Michelin Express is still temporarily suspended. Slow trains are operating as usual, but passengers must disembark and cross at the damaged bridge, and luggage must be transferred.

Additional Night Trains

Between Hanoi and Lao Cai, an additional night train has been added every night except Tuesdays and Fridays since June 23rd, with the same schedule. However, only first- and second-class sleeping cars are added on Tuesdays and Fridays; the other days only have ordinary first-, second-, and third-class passenger cars. Luggage carried by passengers traveling from Haiphong to Kunming is limited to 60 kilograms and must be carried with them. When transported by rail, the limit is 250 kilograms only for the Haiphong-Lao Cai section. The luggage limit is looser from Lao Cai to Kunming, but passengers are responsible for hiring porters to transfer luggage across the damaged bridge, and this is limited to clothing, bedding, and personal belongings. Other items are absolutely restricted. Passengers traveling from Kunming to Haiphong are not subject to the above restrictions. A certain travel agency has dispatched personnel to Majie Station to assist passengers in taking care of their luggage.

Flight Schedules

The schedules of various airlines, such as Air France and Imperial Airways, are operating as usual, but the schedules may change temporarily. The China National Aviation Corporation's Kunming-Hekou route still operates on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but has been changed to a same-day round trip. The Air Transport Administration of the Ministry of Communications has also dispatched aircraft to operate the Kunming-Hekou route since last week, tentatively once a week, flying from Kunming to Hekou on Mondays and returning the same day.

Freight Regulations

The transportation of all goods to the interior via Vietnam has been suspended. The reporting of border taxes for items carried by Shanghai-Hong Kong passengers traveling to the interior via Haiphong has also been temporarily suspended. However, passengers traveling from Kunming to Haiphong are not subject to these restrictions. Goods exported from the interior via Vietnam can now be transported as usual.

### Japanese Ship Daishan Maru Disappears After Being Captured; Japanese Planes and Warships Scout in All Directions; Loitering Around Chuanshan Near Ningbo

The Japanese ship Daishan Maru set sail from Daishan on the 6th of this month, heading for Shenjiadou Town. While passing the Hengliang waters, the ship was suddenly seized by the inspection unit of the Dinghai Maritime Guerrilla Force. Huang Bohe, the puppet "chairman" of Daishan, and a group of more than twenty people were also arrested. The whereabouts of the ship and Huang are currently unknown.

Japanese Reconnaissance

Since the disappearance of the Daishan Maru, Japanese aircraft have been scouting the coast of Ningbo quite frequently. Chuanshan in Zhenhai was once bombarded by Japanese warships. The American Merope ship outside Zhenhai Port was chased by Japanese aircraft to the Jintang waters. It seems that the Japanese pilot mistook the ship for the Daishan Maru. The Merope recently transported rice from Hong Kong to Ningbo and was greatly frightened by the chase by the Japanese aircraft. It has now unloaded its cargo and returned to Hong Kong.

Guerrilla Activity

According to visitors from Dinghai, the personnel of the "maintenance association" of the Dinghai Maritime Guerrilla Force are quite wary. It is also learned that the government's orders can still be conveyed normally in the 53 rural towns under the jurisdiction of Dinghai County, except for the four areas occupied by the city, Yamenqian, Daishan, and Shenjiamen.

### European Refugees Can Reside in the Concessions; Must Obtain an Entry Permit from the Concession Authorities

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a set of regulations on October 22nd of last year regarding the complete accommodation of refugees from Europe in the International Settlement. These regulations have been revised and are being implemented from this month onwards. Therefore, European refugees residing in the International Settlement must comply with the following provisions: (1) Refugees are not allowed to reside in the Settlement without obtaining an entry permit from the Shanghai Municipal Police. The issuance of permits is at the discretion of the Police.

(5) Applications for entry permits should be submitted to the Police Bureau through the Committee for the Relief of European Jewish Refugees in Shanghai, located in Room 177, Riverside Apartments, Suzhou Road, Shanghai.

### Japanese Army to Hold Night Exercises; Date is the Late Evening of the 20th

From the late evening of the 20th to the morning of the 21st of this month, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces will hold night exercises of considerable scale within their so-called security zone. The exercise area will be announced by the Japanese military authorities. That night will again disturb the peaceful dreams of many residents.

### Resolution of the Shengjing Ship Case; British Naval Authorities Accept Japanese Protest; French Request for the Return of Military Supplies Denied

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury stated that the press corps of the Japanese fleet in China announced yesterday (14th) that the Shengjing Ship case of the Taikoo Company was satisfactorily resolved on Sunday evening after the relevant British authorities formally expressed regret to the Japanese naval authorities and issued strict warnings to all British shipping companies and merchant ships flying the British flag, and the Shengjing ship, moored outside Wusong Port, was allowed to resume its regular coastal shipping. The communiqu√© described the circumstances leading to the Shengjing ship's detention on July 9th and disclosed that the Japanese side had lodged a protest with the British naval authorities, stating that the Shengjing ship was carrying ammunition from Tianjin to Shanghai for France, a belligerent country, which violated Japan's policy of preventing the expansion of the European war to the Far East, and demanded that the French ammunition be handed over to the Japanese side. The British side agreed, and the French ammunition was unloaded at Wusong on July 11th. Discussions then took place on the issue of the Shengjing ship disregarding the Japanese order to cease operations. The British authorities finally accepted the Japanese request, and the Shengjing ship case was resolved. As for the British ship's actions, the Japanese naval authorities ordered the Shengjing ship to return to port immediately after the ammunition was unloaded, allowing it to act freely after the resolution of the incident.

While the issue was not fully resolved, the French defense forces in this city requested the British authorities to ask the Japanese navy to return the ammunition, but the Japanese authorities refused and explained the reasons why the ammunition could not be returned. The French side then withdrew its request.

### Coolidge Liner Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong: Carrying a Large Number of Passengers; Unprecedented Crowding; Rumors Abound in Hong Kong, But No Facts to Prove Them

The American President Coolidge liner arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The number of passengers it carried was unprecedented. Those disembarking in Shanghai included 114 first-class passengers, 135 third-class passengers, and 103 tourists. In addition, there were 464 passengers passing through Shanghai, most of whom were bound for San Francisco. According to an official of the American President Lines yesterday, all cabins on the ship were fully booked even before the "invasion" panic in Hong Kong. Later arrivals only sought a small space, barely enough to kneel, and did not mind the conditions. Although the Hong Kong company tried its best to accommodate everyone, many were still left behind.

Rumors in Hong Kong are Rampant, but Difficult to Confirm

According to passengers on board, rumors were rife in Hong Kong, even saying that Japanese troops had crossed the Shenzhen border. At the same time, refugees fleeing from the occupied areas made the local residents terrified. However, these rumors could not be confirmed. The large-scale evacuation of Hong Kong residents is an undeniable fact. Every outgoing ship was packed to the brim, extremely crowded. Passengers only sought to get on board, regardless of cabin class. According to officials at the Jianghai Customs, the luggage brought by the President Coolidge was piled up like a mountain, a truly unprecedented sight. It is expected that the customs clearance process will take a whole day.

Loading Delayed, Departure This Afternoon

The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States at 11:00 PM last night. However, due to the large amount of cargo and the time required for loading and unloading, the departure has been changed to 11:30 AM this afternoon. The farewell ferry will depart from the Xinguang Wharf at 10:00 AM this morning. In addition, the company's world-class liner, the President Adams, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the United States via Japan today, has been slightly delayed due to a hurricane at sea a few days ago. It is now expected to arrive in Shanghai at noon tomorrow (the 17th), berthing at buoys 12 and 13. It is reported that the ship is carrying 38 passengers and 60 people passing through Shanghai to Southeast Asia and around the world. The reception ferry will depart from the Xinguang Wharf at 11:30 AM tomorrow and return to the Xinguang Wharf at 1:00 PM in the afternoon to disembark passengers. The ship is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong at 1:45 AM on the 19th (i.e., midnight on the 18th), via Luzon and various ports in Southeast Asia, then via Bombay and the Cape of Good Hope back to New York. The final farewell ferry will depart from the Xinguang Wharf at 12:15 AM on the 19th (i.e., midnight on the 18th).

The Interior of China is Full of Vitality

It is reported that among the passengers arriving in Shanghai on the President Coolidge yesterday morning were Mr. McHugh, Naval Attach√© of the American Embassy, Mr. Steed, Chairman of the Board of the China Press and Evening Post, and Mr. Fei Wusheng, former Secretary-General of the YMCA. According to Mr. McHugh, the American Ambassador to China, Mr. Johnson, will soon come to Shanghai from Chongqing. Mr. Steed went to Hong Kong for business reasons a month ago and returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Fei, "The evacuation of overseas Chinese from Hong Kong was indeed the wisest measure in terms of preparedness." Mr. Fei had lived in the interior of China for the past two and a half years. When the Japanese army attacked Nanjing, he was still in Nanjing. After that, he went to Chongqing and did not leave until a month ago. It is said that the situation in China's wartime capital is quite enthusiastic and serious, and the spirit of the Chinese people is also the same. There is no pessimism in Chongqing. Any event, although extremely difficult at present, can continue to proceed with a good spirit. He also said that when he left Hong Kong, the situation in Hong Kong was still very peaceful, and the evacuation did not cause serious difficulties. Therefore, the evacuation of overseas Chinese was in fact the wisest move. It is said that Mr. Fei will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then plans to travel to the United States.

### Salvation Army Concludes Work at Shelter, Thousands of Refugees See Them off

The Salvation Army in Shanghai took over the first shelter on Dunxin Road in July last year and has now completed one year of service. The decision to withdraw was made by the North China Headquarters, which will send them to other assignments. The Shanghai Relief Association requested them to stay, but the request was not granted. Yesterday, the Association's Management Office Director Guan Jiongzhi, Chen Xianmo, and others took over the shelter. The Salvation Army completed the handover on the same day. At the same time, thousands of staff and refugees in the shelter set off firecrackers, presented flags, and were seen off by the band of the Orphanage. At that time, both sides felt happy. It is reported that the Association has reassigned Zhang Nairen as the director, Wang Jinghao as the deputy director, and Wang Yangqiao and Zheng Dahua as the general directors.

### The Establishment of the Special Police in Western Shanghai is Still Difficult; The Puppet Regime Has Replied to the Municipal Council, But the Two Sides' Opinions Are Not Consistent

According to the Information Office of the Municipal Council, on April 26 of this year, the Director of the Police Department of the Council, Mr. Bowness, sent a draft agreement on the transfer of police power in Western Shanghai to Mr. Lu Ying, "Director of the Municipal Police Bureau." The above-mentioned draft agreement included the results of previous exchanges of opinions. The Council received a reply from "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an on the 13th of this month.

Research and Suggestions According to reporters from Da Zhong News Agency, regarding the issue of establishing a "new police authority in the Western Shanghai Extra-Settlement Roads Area," "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an submitted a suggestive "agreement" to the Municipal Council yesterday. This negotiation has now entered the final stage. According to the Municipal Council, this suggestion is currently under study to determine whether it is consistent with the trial agreement established by Chief Superintendent Bowness of the Police Department and "Police Director" Lu.

No Establishment Date

According to observers with access to information, the news from the Japanese side that the "New Police Station" will be established on August 1 seems overly optimistic. They pointed out that even if the agreement is formally established, it will still take considerable time to find housing and prepare uniforms. Japanese sources said that the "Preparatory Committee" for the establishment of the "Special Police" has been organized by the Municipal Council and the puppet "Municipal Government" and will be established on Monday. It is said that the work of this "Preparatory Committee" is to select "police officers" and solve various technical problems.

Dispute over Personnel

The Japanese side also reported that after the establishment of the "New Police Station," 280 Chinese, British, and Japanese patrolmen will be dispatched to protect the Extra-Settlement Roads Area. Sources with access to information also said that the Municipal Council and the puppet "Municipal Government" are still in dispute over the selection of the "Director of the Criminal Division" of the "New Police Station." It is said that the Municipal Council insists that the "Director of the Criminal Division" should be a British person, while the "Municipal Government" opposes this proposal.

### Hurricane Approaches Japan, Prepare for High Tides; Fear of Coinciding with Hurricane; Warehouses Start Flood Prevention

According to reporters from Datong News Agency who inquired at the Xujiahui Observatory, the Pacific hurricane, after passing east of Shanghai, is now advancing towards Japan. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the hurricane reached 41 degrees north latitude and 138 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM yesterday. The center of the storm is within 120 nautical miles. The wind force is unknown. It has crossed the Taiwan Strait and is advancing towards Japan.

Climate

Since the hurricane passed to the east of Shanghai, the climate has been extremely hot. Yesterday, the highest temperature rose to 94.5 degrees. The highest temperature last year was only 85.6 degrees. Because the wind is calm, the heat is even more unbearable. The epidemic hospitals are overcrowded. At the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital alone, the number of outpatients yesterday reached more than 500.

Tides

There will be high tides in the Huangpu River from the 19th of this month. According to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, the levels will be between 11 feet. If a hurricane coincides with this time, Shanghai will face a rather serious flood. Therefore, the relevant departments are paying close attention. In addition, the flood prevention work of the riverside warehouses in Shanghai has already begun.

### Severe Drought and Famine in Zhenjiang, Jintan, and Lishui, No Less Than in Ningbo and Shaoxing

Drought has caused a disaster. There has been no rain for months. The fields are cracked, and a drought has formed. There is a rice shortage in five counties, and the situation is serious. The cries of starving people are everywhere. Since spring, there has been little rainfall. Today, people from our hometowns came and said that initially, the selling price of white rice was 40 yuan per dan. After the Dragon Boat Festival, the rice seedlings could not be planted, and the price of rice rose step by step. Recently, it has reached a high price of 120 yuan, but each household is limited to buying only two sheng per day. Families with many people have difficulty surviving. In the shortest period, it is feared that the grain stores will have no rice to sell. There are more than three million disaster victims in the five counties, crying for food. We hope that the fellow villagers from the five counties in Shanghai will donate generously. If there are donations, please hand them over to reliable banks.

### Municipal Council Discusses Rent Issues; Focus on the Profiteering of Subletters; Landlords Generally Increase Rent by Only 10%; Subletters Increase it by More Than Double

According to the Municipal Council, at the beginning of June this year, several senior officials of the Council had several discussions on the issue of rent in the Public Settlement. The discussions were chaired by the Director-General and President of the Council. The senior officials included the Council's lawyer, the Chief of the Finance Department, the Chief of the Taxes Department, and the Director of the Industrial Section. They reviewed the legal, evaluation, and social aspects of the rent issue. At the same time, they sought information from landlords and other relevant parties for research.

Rent Increase Comparison

The officials were particularly concerned about the disparity between the percentage increase in rent for Chinese-style houses paid by subletters to landlords and the percentage increase paid by tenants to subletters. The former is mostly restricted by court rulings, increasing by 10% compared to before the war, while the latter, according to the cost of living index, has increased by 205%.

Negotiations

Fifteen members of the Rent Investigation Committee organized by the French Municipal Council participated, including representatives of Chinese nationality. The landlord representatives were Xu Maotang and Qu Zhenhua, and the tenant representatives were Wang Runsheng and Zhu Wende. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 10:00 AM this morning at the French Municipal Council Administration Building at 375 Avenue Joffre to discuss the committee's rules of procedure and various issues related to rent.

### Lawyer Mi Xitong's Opinion on Group Life Insurance

The Shanghai Bar Association intends to organize group life insurance for its members and has drafted an outline of the plan, sending letters to all members to solicit opinions. The details have been seen in various newspapers. The following is a record of the opinions of lawyer Mi Xitong, a member of the association, on this plan. Lawyer Mi said that group life insurance is indeed a good thing for the members, but the method must be carefully considered to avoid any oversights. In my opinion, there are many concerns about the association handling this insurance itself. The complexity of the procedures and the importance of the responsibilities are beyond the ability of non-specialized personnel and those not dedicated to their duties. For example, Article 7 of the plan outline states, "A separate management committee will be formed to be responsible for the custody and use of this fund, investing it in stable and reliable enterprises." Most of the members of the association are preoccupied with their work and rarely have enough time to devote themselves to it. It is practically impossible to ask them to be fully responsible. Moreover, investment is not guaranteed to be profitable unless it is done by those with rich experience and superior knowledge. If there is even a slight mistake, the funds will no longer be available. Who will be responsible? This is the guarantee that members must demand. Also, Article 4 of the outline states, "According to past memories, the average annual mortality rate is about 24 per thousand people." This is an unfounded assumption. If it exceeds this rate, it may be possible to make up for it if it is a small number. But if the difference is too large, who can pay for this huge amount of compensation, and from whom will it be recovered? All of the above must be carefully considered in advance.

### Mother-in-law Sues Daughter-in-law for Abandoning Her Daughter and Injuring Her Elders

Madam Xu Tangshi, a local elderly woman residing at 310 Jaxi Road, is 54 years old this year. She has recently retained lawyer Yin Yong to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court, accusing her daughter-in-law Xu Qu Jinfang (19 years old, from Changzhou) and her mother, Madam Qu (residing at 6 Shenyu Lane, Wuding Road, McGin Road), of abandoning her daughter and conspiring to commit assault. She requested that the court investigate and prosecute according to the law. It is said that the plaintiff's son Yun Sheng is currently doing business in Nanjing. In the winter of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), he married Qu Jisheng's daughter, the first defendant, through a matchmaker. After entering the family, she often complained about the poverty of her husband's family. The plaintiff and her son Yun Sheng often persuaded and comforted her. On February 9th of this year, she gave birth to a granddaughter named Baodi. The first defendant breastfed and raised her herself. The plaintiff handled household chores at home. Unexpectedly, the first defendant often made excuses to return to Ningbo, often taking her clothes and bags with her. On June 18th, at 3:00 PM, the first defendant abandoned her daughter Baodi on the bed and suddenly wanted to leave. At this time, the plaintiff discovered that all her jewelry and clothes had been secretly taken away. Under these circumstances, as the head of the family, she naturally asked reasonable questions. If you leave without taking your child, who will breastfeed her? How can you come and go so casually? Unexpectedly, the first defendant immediately responded with abusive words. The plaintiff, thinking of the baby girl who was only four months old, and the dire consequences if no one raised her, grabbed the first defendant's hair in a panic and pushed her away. The plaintiff was old and weak and had to endure the humiliation, weeping silently. The next day, at 5:00 PM, the first defendant, accompanied by her mother, the second defendant, and the male matchmaker Feng Xinyi, along with four unknown women, came to the plaintiff's house and, without asking why, slapped and beat the plaintiff indiscriminately. It was not until the plaintiff's daughter Huizhen ran out to shout for help that the defendants and others fled. The defendants' actions of abandoning her daughter and conspiring to commit assault are in violation of Articles 294 and 277 of the Criminal Code, and the plaintiff requests that the court investigate and prosecute according to the law, etc. According to the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Zhang Minsheng, opened a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff and her agent lawyer appeared in court and stated the above. The defendants and their defense lawyer also appeared in court, denying the facts of abandoning the girl and assault, stating that the plaintiff abused the daughter-in-law, did not feed her enough, and forced her to return to her mother's house, etc. After verifying the statements in court, the court instructed to reschedule the hearing to the 29th and ordered both parties to reconcile outside the court.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor: According to my client, Mr. Zhang Deyu, manager of the Linji Coffin Transport Company, "The report published in your newspaper on the 12th of this month regarding the lawsuit against Linji Coffin Transport Company is entirely one-sided. Since its establishment, our company has been operating for decades and has long been known for its credit by various clan associations and guild halls. The sinking of the ship in Xuliujing, Hupu, due to the storm was an act of God that could not be resisted. How could the coffin relatives, Wu Fatin, etc., who do not understand the facts, be instigated by our company's former accounting office to fabricate false accusations and extort money, claiming 'fraud and breach of trust'? Our company has transported the coffin on a special ship, but it did not reach its destination due to sinking in the middle. How can this be called fraud and breach of trust? As for the claim of 'repainting old coffins and selling them at high prices,' where is the evidence? Who was it sold to? Even more ridiculous is the claim of 'not pointing out the boatman.' During the court hearing on the 11th, our company brought the boatman Wu Jinsheng to court for questioning, and the facts are all there. How can they be allowed to make such reckless statements? Although the truth will eventually come out after a judgment, the constant fabrication of facts and arbitrary defamation during the litigation process will not only confuse the public but also affect our company's reputation. Therefore, we have entrusted you to write to the newspaper for clarification." In view of this, we hereby write to your newspaper to request that it be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the matter and prevent misunderstandings. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Yang Xun, July 14, 29th year of the Republic of China.

To the Editor: According to Mr. Xia Hanzhang of the Xiadexing Matting Company, "Yesterday, I read in your newspaper a report about a fire on Nanjing Road, stating that it was suddenly discovered in the Xiadexing Matting Company on the upper floor. After investigation, our warehouse here is locked and not inhabited. There are no electric lights installed, and it has been locked for more than 15 hours. There is no possibility of a fire in the upper floor warehouse. The cause of the fire clearly originated from the lower floor. This report is likely based on inaccurate hearsay. In addition to entrusting your lawyer to issue a statement in the newspaper, we also request that you write a special letter to the newspaper to clarify the matter and correct the information." In view of this, we hereby write to you and request that it be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column for clarification. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Shi Qinghua.

To the Editor: This lawyer, according to the perennial legal counsel of Huierkang's legal representative, holds that the Huierkang store was mentioned in one of the crimes in the Zose district in today's paper, July 14, 29th year. Huierkang opened more than 20 years ago, with western food, tea and snacks for business, for people to rest, no dancing, and other improper business. Although your newspaper has published hearsay, it is important to influence the business of Huierkang, so please be a representative to prepare the letter statement, and please the newspaper to allow the letter to be corrected in the letter in order to avoid the false rumour and maintain business. Yours truly, Lawyer Sha Xunyis, July 15, 29th year.

### Price Stabilization Rice to be Implemented This Morning; Rice Industry Acknowledges Sufficient One-Tenthousand Tons and Has Ordered Via Telegram; Association Orders at 65 Yuan per Bag

The Shanghai Public Settlement Municipal Council announced yesterday, "In accordance with the Shanghai Price Stabilization Rice Committee's decision to re-establish price stabilization points in the Public Settlement and French Concession starting July 16th, various rice shops have been entrusted to handle the issuance of tickets and rice sales from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM daily. Each ticket sells for one yuan in legal tender, and each yuan can buy four market catties of rice. The rice shop is noted on the ticket, and the ticket holder can directly purchase from the respective rice shop. It is investigated that this kind of price stabilization is purely a charitable act, and it is intended to benefit people's lives. All rice purchasers must adhere to this aim, strictly abide by order, and not cause trouble. If there are unruly people who take the opportunity to cause trouble at the various rice shops, they will be immediately arrested and severely punished. This is hereby announced."

Ordered Rice in Transit

In order to suppress rice prices, the authorities in the two concessions specifically ordered the relevant groups in the rice industry to not only find ways to suppress rice prices but also to raise funds to order a large amount of foreign rice, transport it to Shanghai for storage, and prepare it for emergencies. Subsequently, the rice industry followed the order and established a small committee to persuade them to order foreign rice separately. After several days of contact, the full amount of one-tenthousand tons (i.e., 100,000 bags) has been acknowledged, and various foreign firms have been entrusted to send telegrams overseas to order them. A total of 7,500 tons were ordered from Saigon and 2,500 tons from Hong Kong. 3,000 tons of rice ordered from Saigon has started shipping from 14th of this month, and is due to arrive at port at the end of the month.

Group Purchases

Since the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association revised the method of group ordering of foreign rice on the 1st of this month, the participation of various public groups has been extremely enthusiastic. As of the 9th, the foreign rice ordered by the association had exceeded 2,000 bags. Therefore, the first batch of more than 2,000 bags was ordered from Saigon on the 9th and will arrive in Shanghai by the middle of next month at the latest. The second batch of about 1,000 bags will also continue to be ordered within the next week. As for the price, it is 65 yuan per bag, but the freight and warehouse rent of two or three yuan per bag are not included. According to the person in charge, he told a reporter from Pingming News Agency yesterday that in order to avoid delaying time, the number of bags per batch has been reduced to 1,000 bags. (According to the original plan, each batch must have 2,000 bags before an order can be placed.)

### Municipal Council Police Chief Superintendent Letter of Thanks to the Shanghai Volunteer Corps

Police Superintendent Bowness of the Municipal Council Police Department specially sent a letter to Hallbar, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, expressing his gratitude to all members of the Corps for their enthusiastic assistance to the police authorities in maintaining law and order.

Education News

### Implementation of National Education in Yunnan Province Included in the Five-Year Plan; Central Government to Subsidize 1.8 Million Yuan Annually; 300 Central Schools to Be Established in the First Year

(Kunming Dispatch) Regarding the implementation of national education nationwide and the method of raising funds, the central and provincial governments will each raise 25%, while county and local levels will raise 50% themselves. The implementation plan for this province has been submitted to the Ministry of Education at the end of April.  A budget has been prepared according to the current living standards of the province, and the amount is quite large. A request has been submitted to the central government for subsidies according to the proposal. Furthermore, the Director of Education repeatedly telegraphed, clarifying that the provincial government and all sectors unanimously and enthusiastically support and promote the national construction plan. The province and counties are making every effort to raise funds, and a certain amount has already been achieved. It is hoped that the central government will consider the poverty and cultural backwardness of the border provinces and provide generous subsidies to expedite the implementation of universal education. The Department of Education received a reply from the Ministry of Education stating that the province's national education plan has been included in the national five-year plan. In the first year, approval has been granted to newly establish 300 central schools each and to renovate or newly establish 2,000 national schools each. The central government subsidy is listed as 1.61 million yuan, and the short-term supplementary training fee is 207,000 yuan. It is expected that the province will raise an equal amount of funds as reported, and the subsidies will be granted accordingly. It seems that the central government is determined to go all out to promote national education, which can be seen from this. The subsidy to this province has also been given preferentially. The responsibilities of government authorities at all levels in this province have been particularly increased. Especially in terms of raising additional funds, the province must raise an equal large amount itself, and each county must also raise its own full amount separately. In total, Yunnan Province must raise a total of 7,268,000 national currency this year (August 1940 to July 1941) in order to complete this unprecedented national construction plan and the foundation of self-government.

### Hong Kong YMCA Relieves Poor Students from Tsing Sai; University Students Can Apply for Travel Expenses; High School Seniors Can Apply for Tuition Fees

(Hong Kong Dispatch) The Hong Kong YMCA Relief Student Committee's 14th registration for applications for travel expenses for poor students from Tsing Sai will begin on July 10th for a period of one month, ending on August 10th. The results will be announced after investigation and review by the association. The registration method is briefly described below: (1) Applicants must submit admission certificates and poverty certificates. (2) Three essays: A. The experience of being a refugee; B. Plans for completing studies; C. The War of Resistance, National Construction, and Youth. (3) Recent academic report cards. (4) One photo of the applicant. According to Zheng Dechao, the person in charge of the association, the regulations for granting this relief are quite strict. Only university students are eligible to apply for travel expenses, and only students above the third grade of high school are eligible to apply for tuition fees. Furthermore, they must have proof of admission and be unable to pay tuition fees due to the war. These points will be investigated in detail by the association. Those who go to the mainland will be given travel expenses as appropriate, but it must also be ascertained where they are going, where they can continue their studies, or whether they have relatives or friends who can provide assistance. This is because it is feared that even with assistance, they will not be able to study and will end up wandering in other places, which would go against the original intention of relieving poor students who are eager to learn. It is also learned that in the past, a total of 414 people have received relief from the association, with a total of 2,656 yuan in national currency and 11,701.46 Hong Kong dollars being issued for travel and tuition fees.

### Finance: Exchange Rate Fluctuations, US Dollar Rises and Falls Back

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC listed prices remained unchanged.  The black market for British and US exchange rates was tight then eased, and after the US dollar broke through the six-yuan level, it fell back immediately, and the result was still flat. Initially, foreign firms had settlements, and Chinese firms and speculators bought in unison, causing it to continue to soften to only 5.84375 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 10:30, a strong atmosphere of peace again disturbed the market, and people were at least affected by it, causing Chinese banks to suddenly turn to selling, and Japanese banks also came to sell, about nearly 100,000 US dollars, and the price rose back. Moreover, in the afternoon, due to the fact that speculators had no shortage of positions to sell, the price became cheaper and cheaper. The US exchange rate fell out of the six-yuan level. Later, it was heard that there were not many transactions, and the changes were also reduced. The closing price was 3 shillings 9.0625 pence for British gold and 6 yuan for US exchange, which was slightly longer than the closing price last Saturday. British currency increased by 0.015625, US currency increased by 0.0625, and futures and spot prices were slightly squeezed open.

Morning Market Buying Trend Still Strong

In the early morning, the exchange rate of British currency against the US dollar did not move, and it was also flat against Shanghai currency, and there was no market for French currency. The US dollar fell by half against the British currency, did not move against Shanghai currency, and there was no market for French currency. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold at 3 shillings 8.90625 pence and US exchange at 5.96875 yuan, which was flat compared to the closing prices last Saturday for both British and US exchange rates. After opening, foreign firms first had an appetite, and the market already showed a soft state. It is estimated that Lucky and other foreign firms sold 7.84375 shillings to foreign firms for British gold in July, and 8.8125 shillings for British gold in August. The HSBC listed price was announced with no changes, and the silver balance tax was also announced with no increase or decrease. After that, Chinese firms and speculators settled near and far US exchange rates, and the price was still tight. The current US exchange rate even reached 5.84375 yuan, while Chinese firms and speculators entered US banks, foreign firms, and overseas positions, etc., 5.9375 and 875 yuan for US exchange in July, and 5.8125 yuan for US exchange in August. Later, Japanese banks came to the market to sell, and HSBC also intended to supply, and the market image turned loose, and it was rumored that the atmosphere of peace was affecting people's hearts. Chinese banks suddenly tended to sell, and it is estimated that Japanese banks sold 5.90625 and 9375 yuan for US exchange in July to foreign firms, and HSBC sold 5.90625 yuan for US exchange in the same month to Shanghai. Later, Chinese banks sold US exchange in the same month to as high as 5.9375 and 96875 yuan, and the closing trend was also loose, with British gold at 3 shillings 9.0625 pence and British exchange at 5.96875 yuan, which was slightly longer than the morning opening of British currency by 0.015625, while the US dollar had no honor or disgrace.

Speculative Selling Suddenly Surges

It is estimated that foreign firms entered the speculator's US exchange this month at 6.03125 yuan, and later transactions were less, lacking changes.

Tianjin British Flat, US Loose

Tianjin, 15th (Monday) Dispatch, the exchange market opened flat this morning, British currency spot did not move, still standing at 3 shillings 625 pence, US exchange spot was loose by 0.0625, to 5.625 yuan, Shanghai currency fell by 25 cents, to 107.75 yuan, and the "United Currency" black market was expensive by 1.35 yuan, to 93.4 yuan.

### Atmosphere of Peace: Gold Market Setbacks Still Minor

Yesterday's cash gold black market rose and then suddenly fell back, and people's hearts were unstable, and there were many follow-up buyers and sellers. The morning's fierce jump opened from 5,500 yuan and rose to 5,560 yuan, but the exchange market reported tight, and then there was an atmosphere of Sino-Japanese peace that both Britain and Germany would mediate, and there were many people with nervous hearts who resold, and foreign exchange also immediately reported hardening. At that time, a certain gold company sold the most, falling to 5,380 yuan, and the noon closing was only 5,395 yuan. The later market was more and more tired, and after opening at 5,390 yuan, it fell to 5,350 yuan with the help of retail investors and silver houses, but the gold company's short positions were covered before the close, pulling up 60 to 70 yuan, and finally closing at 5,380 yuan, which was 30 yuan lower than the closing price last Saturday. The total transaction volume was still strong, about 3,000 taels or so, and the silver building jewelry gold finally hung down by 10 yuan, and customs gold remained flat.

Gold Falls 30 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially because the foreign exchange was quite tight, and people's hearts were firm, the market opened with a crazy increase of 85 yuan, and the gold company entered 20 taels from the silver house, for 5,500 yuan. Although the silver house slightly vomited, it had a slight setback of 10 yuan. After all, the foreign exchange at that time was still reported soft, and the silver house helped to tend to cover the short positions, and new buyers soon stirred up dozens of yuan, and the silver house entered 20 taels from the money exchange industry, rising to 5,560 yuan. However, after this, the number of buyers suddenly decreased, and a certain gold company violently threw out, and more retail investors saw the scene and sold off, so it fell back 100 yuan, and the silver house sold 10 taels to the gold company, retreating to 5,460 yuan. Then, relying on the securities help to slightly climb in, and at that time, the money exchange industry's appetite was also good, it rose back 50 yuan, and the gold company did 20 taels, for 5,510 yuan. Taking into account that the foreign exchange was still in a loose trend, a certain gold company once again violently sold off, and there was a certain kind of negative news in the market, so it once again caused more retail investors to vomit out, and soon it was re-seen to return small by 130 yuan, and the silver house sold 30 taels to the gold company, for 5,380 yuan. Later, the silver house sold 10 taels to the silver building, for 5,395 yuan, as the noon closing price. The situation was still inferior in the early afternoon, and the opening was slightly pressed by 5 yuan, to 5,380 yuan. Later, the silver house and more retail investors vomited out, and it was re-seen to do small by 40 yuan, and the silver house sold 30 taels of money to the money exchange industry, for 5,350 yuan. After entering, a certain gold company's short covering was extremely strong, pulling up 70 yuan, and a certain gold company entered 30 taels from the silver house, for 5,420 yuan. Before the close, a certain money exchange industry came to vomit out again, and it could no longer support it. The silver houses did 30 taels with each other, for 5,380 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it was smaller by 30 yuan compared to the previous day, and the whole day rose and fell by 210 yuan. The cash gold company's own brand gold sold out was more than 10 yuan higher than the cooked red, and the purchase reduction was 30 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little to no activity.

Jewelry Gold Hangs Small 10 Yuan

The initial sale of jewelry gold per tael, Da Tong Hang still hung at 560 yuan, and at ten o'clock, it hung 10 yuan higher, and at 10:30, it returned small by 10 yuan, and at 12:35, it was small by 10 yuan. There were no changes after this, and as a result, it squeezed small by 10 yuan. It is estimated that Da Tong Hang changed to hang 550 yuan, and the new Hang Tong Hang was the same as the upper price, and the purchase reduction was about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Like Rabbits and Hawks

Yesterday's foreign currency market, after the cooked red rose, it suddenly fell, and British and US gold pounds also rose first and then fell, and finally fell by one yuan each. The supply and demand of British gold bills were even, and the market price stood flat. The US gold bill initially rose to 17.07 yuan, and then suddenly rumors about Sino-Japanese peace revived, and people's hearts were not without stimulation, so that all parties supplied extraordinarily diligently, and the price retreated to 16.6 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it once rose to 16.72 yuan, and finally retreated to 16.55 yuan, which was 0.2 yuan lower than last Saturday. The Hong Kong bill, however, was in strong demand due to the rising trend of the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate, and the evening market rose to 3.77 yuan, which was 0.02 yuan higher than last Saturday. Canadian bills and Philippine bills were not lacking in supply, and the market prices all tended to be tired. Japanese remaining bills and Korean bills were in extraordinarily strong demand, and the market prices all soared, the former rising to 1.24 yuan and the latter rising to 1.05 yuan.

### Securities Rumors Favorable to Bulls, Domestic Debt Rises Sharply in Afternoon

The securities black market suddenly rose in the afternoon yesterday. There were rumors in the market that there was again an atmosphere of peace, and that Britain had given up the Far East, and it was seen in the evening newspapers. Although it was inevitable that it was too early to pass on, the price of gold fell as a result, and the public debt suddenly rose. It can be seen that there are too many gold bulls and too many public debt shorts. After the public debt market rose, it attracted more bulls to come out, and the market price still had a dazed and uncertain image. If there are no other unexpected attacks in the market situation, the current price may be temporarily established. Trading was flat yesterday morning. Da Feng and No. 22 bought in, and Yi Tai and No. 16 sold out, and the market price had almost no rise or fall. Rumors suddenly rose in the afternoon, stirring up general floating space to cover, Type A broke out of 62 yuan, Type B broke out of 3 yuan, and Type C rushed out of 1 yuan. The market price was quite good. In the middle, due to the fact that many parties once came out, they returned small by about 0.2 yuan. Soon they still proceeded to lift up, and the buying momentum of various gangs suddenly increased. Da Feng continued to buy in, and Xie Da Ren Chang Shun Heng Le Mao and No. 11 all had considerable recoveries. No. 16 continued to sell, and Lian He Hong Da Tong Shun Tong Kang all had sales, and the market price was low and then high, because the retail investors' appetite was also very enthusiastic. As a result of the day, all rose, and it is estimated that it ranged from 0.2 yuan to 0.55 yuan. The total number of transactions was more than 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading, 200 shares of Silk Industry Bank shares were traded at a price of 24.5 yuan.

Yesterday's stock market opening at the Public Industry Office, as expected by the general public, the trend was extremely firm and rising. Within the first hour, the buying momentum was great, and the stocks listed in the market list almost all rose according to the list, and even some rose more than 20% compared to the closing price last week. The wind of profit-taking and settlement suddenly rose, and most of the sellers were satiated with the purchases made last week and settled them. The operators who are convinced that there is an upward grasp of the goods received have different messages. The reasons for the rebound at the close are difficult to say for sure. The day's trading was extremely large, and the market was in a state of flux. When the price rebounded, buyers surged in, so it is difficult to say at this moment whether this fleeting prosperity has come to an end.

### Grain: More Than 50,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Continue to Arrive; Saigon No. 1 Enters the 60 Yuan Level; Down 8-9 Yuan from the Highest Price

After the rice market once rose slightly before last week and returned to flat, it presented a sharp decline yesterday. The large number of foreign rice en route that successively arrived caused people's hearts to collapse. The route to the countryside in the mainland was stagnant, and the buying momentum of the store appetite on this street also declined. In an instant in the early market, the prices of various foreign rice fell by more than one yuan. After that, they continued to fall straight all the way, without any turning point. As a result, the closing price of No. 1 Chen Saigon had fallen into the 60 yuan level, only 58.5 yuan, No. 2 56 yuan, 55.5 yuan, No. 1 Siam 58 yuan, No. 2 55.6 yuan, 55 yuan, Fire Twisted 57 yuan, 56.5 yuan, Hong Kong Sharp 56.5 yuan to 55.4 yuan, Small Twisted 56 yuan, 55.5 yuan, Tokyo Broken Sharp 51.5 yuan, the next one 49.5 yuan, Broken Sharp Special From 42.5 yuan, the next one is similar to Qi 38 yuan, Rice Lu 456 yuan, which is more than 2 yuan lower than the closing price before last week. In terms of period rice, the road goods packed on the 20th and 26th are also expected to arrive on the day. Therefore, after the application for the market opening price, the market conditions immediately declined in the lively selling sound. Especially the devaluation of road goods is the most. The opening price for the 26th was 67 yuan, which was 1.5 yuan less than last Saturday. Then, from 65.5 yuan to 65 yuan, there was a shout of 64.5 yuan for immediate delivery. The 20th installation opened at 65.1 yuan, which was a huge fall of 3.45 yuan compared to last Saturday. Now, although foreign rice is sold in the early market, since the transshipment and the mainland have been obstructed, and the flat rice is opened on the same day, the market price has also fallen by 2 yuan in the weak and sluggish real consumption. Now, only 3,000 bags are consumed, and 300 tons of road goods are consumed.

A large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again yesterday. Yih Ho Foreign Company's Mingsheng Wheel brought 4,000 bags from Haiphong and 15,863 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Taikoo Company's Chongqing Wheel transported 17,142 bags from Hong Kong, and Jinan Wheel also brought 19,183 bags from Hong Kong, and both wheels stopped at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, a total of 56,188 bags of foreign rice arrived.

Although the arrival of glutinous rice is lacking, the market is depressed, and the sales market is also stagnant, so the owners have no intention of holding on, and the selling prices have all been reduced by 2 yuan. The special opening price for Jin Li and Te Yuan was 64 yuan, the market for big cities was 63 yuan, the Chang Dan Bai Yuan was 612 yuan, and the Hong Kong Bai Yuan was 634 yuan.

The source of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica is limited, only 600-700 bags. How can foreign rice be sold off again and again, and the rumors of black market transactions outside the market have all been eclipsed. Since there is little to no activity, the price has also continued to depreciate by 1-2 yuan. Changbang Special Japonica has entered the 70 yuan level, only 689 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou White Japonica is high from 667 yuan, and the next one is Su 645 yuan, Qing Si Thin Rice 678 yuan, Nangang Early Rice 656 yuan, and it will reach 634 yuan.

### Chinese Flour Mill Plate Increases Price; Opens at 16 Yuan Per Bag

Flour: Yesterday, Chinese flour mills such as Fuxin and Fufeng factories had resumed production and were supplying as usual. However, the No. 2 flour mill plate has risen to 16 yuan, which is a sharp increase of 80 cents compared to before. The Chinese factory flour that has been brewing for many days ended with a price increase. Since the factory plate has reached 16 yuan, the real sales on this street may not be prosperous, creating an opportunity for the dumping of foreign flour. It is heard that the Muke side continued to purchase more than 10,000 bags of foreign flour such as foreign fort and horse brand foreign flour, and the price was US$3.70, and the combined bag was also equal to the Chinese flour. Its quality is better, so buyers are happy to buy it. The prices of other Japanese factory flour and inland flour are flat and tired, and transactions are also 3,400 bags.

Wheat: Yesterday, the source of new wheat was about 10,000 bags, all of which were unloaded in Hongkou. In addition to a part directly distributed to Japanese factories, Chinese factories also purchased in retail, and the price was higher than that of Japanese factories. Because of the current environment, Chinese factories cannot easily purchase without lowering the price. It is heard that the purchase price of Fufu factories is 23.5 to 24 yuan, and there is no formal activity in the market.

### Sugar Market: Refrigerator Flower Green Sees New High Price

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The guild's allocated plate for 24 coarse white was 68.1 to 68 yuan at the main station, with little rise or fall. Foreign station goods were not traded. The transfer goods are currently trading at 53.6 yuan per station list, up 30 cents. The delivery on the 22nd initially rose 60 cents to 54.2 yuan, but then returned to 53.6 yuan. Taikoo Car White B mark West Station 78 yuan, East Station 77.5 yuan, Dutch Red 58 yuan, 100 bags of Hong Kong gang's front to ice flower green were once called 75 yuan but did not succeed. Yesterday, they opened at 73 yuan, which is also a new record. The day before yesterday (14th), 3,125 bags of Taikoo Car Sugar were transported from Hong Kong.

### Cotton Yarn: Chinese vs. Japanese Yarn, Differing Fortunes

The yarn market is stable, with a steady trend and a slight upward wind. This is because demand for coarse and fine yarn continues unabated in the South China area. Therefore, the bullish sentiment is calm, and some are taking a strategy of selling high and buying low, resulting in a tranquil situation. However, Japanese yarn remains in a slump and unable to rise. The situations differ, partly because Hong Kong merchants have healthy sales channels, and partly because the avenues are narrow.

The spot yarn market opened rather flat this morning. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn opened at 1,020 yuan, falling to 1,018 yuan. This price hovered for quite some time, before news of eager purchasing by Guangdong merchants boosted morale. Buyers in the market became slightly more interested, and the price rose to 1,030 yuan at closing. It is estimated that 1,825 bales were traded in half a day. Transactions for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn quietly increased by 19 yuan. Yesterday, 60 bales of cotton yarn arrived in Xiamen. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below:

Fellow Traders: 830, Hong Kong: 810, Ningbo: 135, Mainland: 5, Xiamen: 45, Total: 1,825

### Chinese Factories Begin Purchasing, Cotton Market Turns Around

Spot cotton trading is slightly more active, with a more bullish momentum. However, Japanese factories are notably inactive and show no signs of purchasing. The market is somewhat better due to healthier demand from Chinese factories and fellow traders. The spot cotton transaction details are recorded below:

Argentine, 228.00, Purchased by Shen Er Factory, 30 bales

Mitterling, 280.00, Purchased by Xin Yu, 100 bales

Tongzhou, 172.00, Purchased by Fellow Traders, 200 bales

Tongzhou, 175.00, Purchased by Qing Xiang, 200 bales

Additional news on foreign cotton market prices: In the New York cotton market, the market situation was very quiet yesterday. Later, due to selling by spot merchants and profit-taking by some bulls, closing prices increased by 4-5 points for near-term contracts and decreased slightly by 1-2 points for distant contracts. The Indian market situation is very firm. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose another 4-5 rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has become increasingly lively in recent days. Chinese factories have also begun purchasing, and traders are particularly excited. There are many transactions. Market inventories are becoming scarce, so all parties believe that cotton prices are about to rise.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Cakes Surge with Rain

Yesterday, the soybean cake market surged because of a rain shower the previous night. Speculators revived, and demand from various quarters increased, causing prices to rise sharply. Qingzhong cakes, in particular, rose sharply, increasing by 1.20 yuan compared to last weekend. Other cakes also rose sharply by 60-70 cents. It is estimated that Xinghua, Quanzhou, Shantou, and inland merchants traded 15,000 pieces of Four-Brand factory cakes at 13.20 yuan, 3,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cakes at 12 yuan, 4,000 pieces of Qingzhong cakes at prices ranging from 10.70 to 11.10 yuan, two carloads of Yuan Long cakes at 11.70 yuan, two carloads of Fei Zi cakes at 11.67 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of Chang Ji cakes at 11.30 yuan.

Yesterday, 1,630 bags of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen and 165 bags to Singapore. Also, 8,200 pieces of soybean cakes, 1,550 cans of raw oil, and 6 packages of tea were shipped to Xiamen, and 25 packages of tea to Singapore.

### Piece Goods and Dyeing Sales Active, Cloth Factories Resume Night Work

Domestic Cloth: The cloth market continued to be strong yesterday due to sustained actual sales. Speculators absorbed supplies aggressively, and sentiment turned bullish. Factories that had suspended operations resumed night shifts. Prices for coarse cloth and twill increased by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece, and dyed cloth increased by about 5 cents. Transactions were most active on this street, with over 300 bales of coarse cloth and twill and over 200 bales of dyed cloth. Shipments from Guangzhou Bay are gradually increasing. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants added nearly 200 bales of colored fine cloth and twill, and Wen and Yong merchants purchased several hundred bales of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and colored cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Market sentiment continued to rise, mainly because dyeing sales in this street became slightly more active yesterday. Transactions included over 500 bales of medium-grade fine cloth, with prices increasing by 2.5 cents per piece. "Dragon Head" fine cloth also continued to be firm, starting from 30.12 yuan and closing at 30.075 yuan in the afternoon. "Four Gentlemen" serge sold for 9.075 cents per yard.

Import/Export: The day before yesterday (14th), 120 bales of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong. Today, 55 bales were shipped to Xiamen and 6 bales to Singapore.

### Coal: Bituminous Coal Dust Sells Well

Since the bituminous coal dust market weakened and prices were cut, the market situation has gradually turned around, attracting purchases from street vendors. Market sentiment has slightly hardened. It is estimated that transactions among traders have resulted in Kaiping No. 1 dust being priced at 190 yuan per ton, No. 2 dust at 170 yuan, and Keelung dust at 150 yuan. The above prices are for delivery from the warehouse, with an additional commission added for delivery to the customer.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Recovers, Local Silk Transactions Stalled

Yesterday, Yokohama spot silk was 1,350 yuan, the same as the previous market. Near-term was 1,396 yuan, up 6 yuan, and distant-term was 1,387 yuan, up 8 yuan. Overseas silk prices fluctuated in the middle. The British sector has been weak for weeks, and the current situation remains the same. Shanghai silk prices have been in a stalemate since white filature was sold for 4,900 yuan per picul. In short, the Shanghai silk market is not free to absorb or release. Silk prices rise and fall abruptly, making it difficult to find a regular pattern. The future trend will depend on the development of the situation.

### Local Black Tea Sales Improve in Germany

Yesterday, the foreign tea market was not deserted. Sales of coarse black tea to Germany were good. However, because traders limited their purchasing prices, market inventories were low, making it difficult to expect significant development in the market. As for green tea sales, only American merchants made some sporadic purchases of Phoenix Eyebrow and Pearl tea. The entire market saw the following purchases by Tongfu, Jinlong, Xingcheng, Xiehe, and other firms: over 530 boxes of red and green tea, with Pearl tea selling for 250-280 yuan and Phoenix Eyebrow tea selling for 270 yuan. Black tea sold for 240-250 yuan. The situation is better for black tea than for green tea. The day before yesterday, 60 packages of tea were shipped from Hong Kong.

### Wang Jin Pure Antimony Continues to Rise Due to Shortage

Since transportation from Hunan for domestic pure antimony was disrupted, local spot goods have become increasingly scarce, and prices have continued to soar. It is found that only one or two hardware stores in the market hold this commodity, so the standard asking price has become monopolized. The price has increased sharply from 7,500-7,600 yuan per picul to around 7,800 yuan. However, there are no large purchases from this street or guest merchants, only a few inquiries. It is said that a batch of spot goods is coming from Hong Kong, but it is also said to be an order for a certain firm.

### Steel Plate Market Slightly Loosens

The ship steel plate market has weakened due to sluggish sales. Yesterday, traders in the market had little activity, and the market situation was bleak. Standard market prices have fallen slightly. Currently, 2.5 mm is quoted at 83 yuan, 5 mm is sold at 64 yuan, 7.5 mm and 10 mm are quoted at 59 yuan, 15 mm and 20 mm are quoted at 57 yuan, 25 mm is sold at 56 yuan, and 40 mm is 57 yuan. All are down 1-2 yuan compared to the previous market. Only a few dozen dan were traded.

### Statistics: Price Changes ‚Äì May ‚Äì (6)

(51) Diluted Gold Paint: Increased to 3.60 yuan per bottle (Huahe Firm)

(52) Drummer Fee: Increased by 30% of the original price (Gusu Qingyin Drummer Industry)

### Old News Re-Copied: 67 Years Ago (446) (See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)

Several Poems

(Poem on Wandering as an Immortal) I love to build my hut by Jian Lake, Admiring the ancient traces of Ji Zhen; I gather pine firewood to cook white stones, Immortals are neither rich nor poor. I bought ten acres of fields on Mount Lao, Eating rice and bathing in the sandy spring; Woodcutters do not understand the practice of immortality, Mistaking Rong Cheng for a young man. Old trees are densely packed by the hundred thousand, A solitary hermitage is deep in the white clouds; The sky is the curtain, the red sun is clear and without heat, I beg for the Six Gui Talisman of the immortals. The water curtain is a thousand feet, suddenly like thunder, Mist rises from Mount Kuanglu, The mountain does not open; I want to visit the monks of the Six Dynasties to talk, But they have not returned from gathering medicine on Stone Bridge. (Night Mooring at Gusu) The scenery is not my own, The sound of the water clock is late where there are many tourists; Pale yellow willows in the hazy moonlight, It is the time when the wine is dispersed from Shantang. Buildings stand in layers with myriad shadows, The lakes and mountains have not changed their old appearance; A river of fishing lights with half the moon, Only missing the bell from Hanshan Temple. (Letter to a Friend) Willow branches slant where the spring breeze is plentiful, Swallows nest in front of the building in the drizzling rain; I hate the shadow of the bright moon in Jiangnan, It secretly shines on the green peach blossoms late at night. The plum wind brings morning warblers singing day after day, Incense ash extinguishes as the curtain opens, falling swallow mud; If I don't look at the mountain scenery for three days, Wildflowers are redder than the stone bridge west. (Feeling from Hearing Frogs) Suddenly I hear frogs croaking in the desolate fields, Countless ponds surround painted buildings. The moon shines brightly on both banks of the green grass crossing, After a rain, the green sandbar appears. They hide in the bottom of the well, still plotting to dominate, And prepare to take revenge by the carriage. Regardless of official or private matters, Their clamor adds to my sorrow. (New Official) Twenty years of vicissitudes, After experiencing hardships, my luck gradually improved; Earning an official position is truly worth writing about, The world adds another kowtowing worm.

### Jesus is the Savior of the Whole World

Jesus Christ was born to establish the Kingdom of Heaven, to bring about universal harmony, mutual aid among mankind, and the eternal removal of national boundaries, racial and class barriers, so that mankind would be as brothers and sisters, and the world as one family, turning weapons into ploughshares. Therefore, Jesus is indeed the Savior of the whole world. In this ever-changing world history, mankind has repeatedly tried to transform the world, resolve disputes, and maintain order, in order to achieve a golden age; unfortunately, methods of self-salvation have repeatedly failed! That noble civilization and amazing science have instead increased human suffering; personal, national, and international injustices are visible everywhere; disease and death are constant companions; and all aspects of life, whether economic, social, moral, or religious, have generated major problems that we cannot solve; hatred, suspicion, and revenge continue endlessly; and cruel wars, piling up corpses like mountains and rivers of blood, cannot be avoided. God has long known that mankind cannot save itself, so He sent His Son (Jesus) to save us, but unfortunately, the world is unwilling to receive Him. Jesus is the "Prince of Peace," and "of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end." He comes to "wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain." Only He is "King of Kings and Lord of Lords," the hope of the world. The Samaritans once testified about Jesus, saying, "We have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world!"

At that time, the Jewish governor Pilate took a sign and wrote a title in three languages‚ÄîHebrew, Greek, and Latin‚Äîand placed it on the cross where Jesus was to be crucified. It read: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." It was not Pilate who wrote this, but God secretly instructed it, clearly announcing to the whole world that Jesus crucified on the cross was the King of the Jews, the Messiah longed for by generations, the one and only great Savior of the world. He deliberately used the languages of three countries to let everyone know that the intention behind it was very mysterious; Hebrew represented religion, Greek represented culture, and Roman represented politics; indicating that Jesus is the Savior of religion, culture, and politics. He is the King of religion, and He will carry out salvation to the ends of the earth. He is the King of culture, and all philosophy, science, and art have truth, beauty, and goodness because of Him. He is also the King of governance, because He is originally the Lord of all and King of Kings. Only when He comes to the world can there be universal harmony. Although we have not yet seen all things subject to Him, He has already been lifted up on the cross and will surely draw all people to Himself. May we all rise up and welcome Jesus, for He alone is the one and only Savior of the whole world!

### The Pain of Children

‚Äî Editor

This is a reader's letter:

Editor of Free Talk:

After reading the two articles "To a Woman Who Wants to Commit Suicide" and "To a Father" on Free Talk on July 11, I was deeply sympathetic to the woman's fate. I couldn't help but think that there are too many such families. How many young men and women either go astray or are suffocated by hardship. "At the beginning of humanity, people are inherently good," but parents not only fail to fulfill their responsibility to educate, not leading their children into the path of light, but instead harm them wantonly? When the children grow up, they add a cry of "ungrateful son/daughter"‚Äîthe children are too miserable. All of this is because parents have not recognized "themselves" and "the family," neither knowing how to be parents nor being able to be parents.

Therefore, I hope that your publication can publish articles on mental health, family education, and parental self-cultivation to awaken people to not neglect family education and the psychology of children, to shoulder the responsibilities of being parents, in order to reduce the suffering of the younger generation. Sincerely wish you

Editorial Peace, Zhi Da respectfully

We are willing to accept Mr. Zhi Da's suggestion to discuss issues related to family education and mental hygiene in Free Talk.

Science

### The Utilization of Atomic Energy

‚Äî Mo Ming

The successful splitting of the uranium atom is the most important new discovery in the scientific community in recent years, and the utilization of atomic energy is the most novel and beautiful dream of today's scientists.

Atoms are the "bricks of the universe," the unit particles that make up all matter, but these unimaginably small particles also have their own complex structures. Each atom has a core at its center, surrounded by electrons, just like "stars surrounding the moon." The atomic nucleus also has varying numbers of neutrons and protons. These neutrons and protons are all active and restless fellows, but they are now tightly confined to an extraordinarily narrow range by an incredible force. This force is very mysterious and great, but when a strong external force, such as a high-speed neutron, bombards the atomic nucleus and causes it to split, a part of this binding force is released, generating the so-called amazing atomic energy. The greater the weight of the atom, the more particles confined in its nucleus, and the greater the energy generated during splitting. Uranium is the heaviest of the ninety-two chemical elements‚Äîatomic weight 238.

Each uranium atom releases approximately 200 million electron volts of energy during splitting. An electron volt is a unit in physics that is difficult to explain or describe in simple terms. Therefore, to understand the magnitude of the number "200 million electron volts," we must use a comparative method: each carbon atom releases approximately four electron volts of energy when it burns, and the most powerful explosive T.N.T. of mankind releases no more than five electron volts per molecule when it explodes. So if we use coal to represent carbon, then the kinetic energy generated by a uranium atom is five million times that of the same amount of coal. No wonder scientists dream of using eight pounds of uranium to power the Queen Mary across the Atlantic!

When a uranium atom splits, it also leaves behind some "fragments," or emits free neutrons. These neutrons are like horses that have escaped their reins, full of energy. When they bombard another uranium atom nearby, they can also cause the atomic nucleus to burst, releasing energy again and emitting neutrons again. If this chain reaction is carried out one after another, the generation of atomic energy can be automatically maintained and promoted. This phenomenon, which scientists call a "chain reaction," can truly be said to be a gift from heaven. Otherwise, when using atomic energy, we would have to continuously break atomic nuclei one by one, which would not only be cumbersome but also extremely uneconomical. But the problem is not so simple. There are three isotopes of the uranium atom, with atomic weights of 238, 235 (the so-called isotopes). According to experimental results, only "uranium 235" is most suitable for "chain reactions." Unfortunately, "uranium 235" happens to be the rarest, accounting for less than one percent of the natural uranium element. Therefore, the current method of separating and concentrating this rare element has become the focus of scientific research. This research is proceeding very slowly, arduously, and expensively. Although we use the most advanced physicists and the most modern and sophisticated equipment to explore it, the results are still pitifully dismal: only one hundred trillionth of a pound of "uranium 235" can be separated per hour. According to this calculation, we would have to wait a million years to accumulate one pound of atomic energy fuel, which is too ridiculous. However, according to recent news from Sweden, a scientist has been able to increase the speed of separating "uranium 235" by more than eleven thousand times using a unique new method. From this, it can be seen that scientific progress is advancing rapidly, and although the goal is distant, the distance is shortening day by day. Recently, the famous American inventor Gano Dunn predicted that the utilization of atomic energy will be realized in the next twenty years, and it may even be accelerated within ten years. This means that in the next ten to twenty years, our world will undergo great changes due to the utilization of atomic energy. Let us wait and see with excitement and full of hope!

The Case of Huo Sang

### The Dancer's End

‚Äî Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 3: Conflicting Information

Old Mao lowered his voice again and replied: "She has stayed out for two nights in the past two weeks. The first night‚ÄîI can't remember the exact date, probably more than a week ago?‚Äîwas uneventful. Miss Wang came back at nine o'clock in the morning and, of course, didn't tell us where she had spent the night. But we had already guessed eight or nine points, because this Zhao Boxiong is stirring things up with her like a fire." He licked his lips and wiped his forehead with his hand.

"But the second time wasn't so peaceful." He continued, then suddenly stopped.

Huo Sang urged him, "How was it not peaceful? Speak quickly."

Old Mao suddenly took a step closer and bent his back slightly. "This time it almost got ugly! That day‚Äîlet me think, it was the day before yesterday, the sixteenth, Friday night, she was out all night again. Then, at eight o'clock in the morning on the seventeenth, Manager Lu suddenly called. When he heard that Miss Wang wasn't there, he got angry."

Huo Sang suddenly stopped him and said, "Wait, who answered the phone?"

Old Mao said, "Jinmei answered it. But I was sweeping the floor here, and I heard it very clearly. Jinmei even made up an excuse, but it didn't work."

"Made up an excuse? What excuse?"

"Jinmei first replied that Miss Wang hadn't gotten up yet. But Manager Lu insisted on talking to Miss Wang, so Jinmei pretended to go upstairs to wake her up. After a while, she replied that she couldn't wake her up. Manager Lu clearly became more suspicious and insisted that she speak to him. Jinmei was forced to tell the truth, so the excuse backfired."

"What happened afterward?"

"Around eight fifteen, Manager Lu rushed over in a huff, but Miss Wang still hadn't returned. We were all worried. Fortunately, Manager Lu didn't go upstairs, and then there was the sound of a car. Miss Wang came back. Then the two of them met, and he started making a fuss in this room."

"How? Did you hear anything?"

Old Mao shook his head, "I didn't hear very clearly, just a sentence or two. Manager Lu said something like, 'You've let me down too much... It must be that Zhao scoundrel... I could tell he wasn't on the right path in the movie theater that day.' After hearing these words, I was naturally clear in my mind. Manager Lu certainly wouldn't wrong her‚Äî"

### Two Appendixes

‚Äî Ou Li

The doctor was already asleep, having sweet dreams, when he was suddenly awakened by the ringing of the telephone. The caller was a familiar patient, speaking urgently, "Doctor, come quickly, my wife has appendicitis."

The doctor sighed and told the man not to make a fuss and to go back to sleep peacefully. He said, "Just let her drink something, and I'll come to see her tomorrow. She doesn't have an appendix."

The husband became more anxious and insisted that she did have an appendix. The doctor said loudly, "She can't have one, I removed her appendix three years ago. I've never heard of anyone having two appendixes."

The husband finally explained, "Have you ever heard of someone having two wives?" The doctor suddenly understood and hurried out. Fortunately, he went early, because that second wife really did have appendicitis!

Publishing

### A Failed Person

‚Äî Hua Zhi

The liveliness of the American publishing industry is well known throughout the world. Taking biographies as an example, at least five or six hundred types are published each year, the content of which is nothing more than the success stories of well-known people in society. However, in addition to many "Success Stories," there are also several "Failure Stories" published this year.

This is quite a novel approach.

Because a person struggles and achieves success, and it is recorded in a book, it becomes a landmark event after a certain number of years, and it is generally not easy to imitate casually; on the other hand, some people undergo various adventures and struggles, but in the end do not succeed. The reasons for their failure can be used as lessons for others, and they can try again and work harder. As the saying goes, "Things in life are often unsatisfactory in eight or nine cases out of ten." The encouragement given by those who fail exceeds that given by those who succeed.

Among these "Failure Stories," some are about industrialists and financiers from the era of economic decline in the United States. They all have a certain status in society now, but they did not reveal the reasons for their success, only the secrets of their failure.

Entertainment

### Regarding The Four Scholars

‚Äî Qin Pi

"The Four Scholars" is one of the group operas, including roles for male, female, painted-face, old male, and clown characters. In terms of performance, all are seen as important, and the plot is quite wonderful. It exposes the malpractices that have been difficult to avoid in our country's judicial circles for hundreds or even thousands of years, the so-called "with wealth and power, filing a lawsuit is no problem," while the weak and helpless, ultimately wronged, also find it difficult to obtain redress. Throughout the ages, it is unknown how many wronged souls have sunk to the bottom of the sea.

However, the structure of Peking Opera is "reunion," and "The Four Scholars" cannot escape this exception. The playwright depicts Song Shijie's righteous rescue of the weak woman, which can be described as vivid and incisive. The entire play, from beginning to end, captures the audience's tense emotions! It is indeed a rare and good play.

I feel that the acting of the protagonist Song Shijie is extremely difficult. In addition to singing, reciting, and acting all requiring excellence, the actor must reach a considerable age to have the necessary skills; otherwise, even with a good voice, it is difficult to please the audience. Looking around the Peking Opera world today, only Ma Lianliang and Zhou Xinfang are qualified for this role. Last month, Lianliang went south and posted "The Four Scholars" on the second evening of his performance. Subsequently, he performed it twice more. Because I admired Zhou Xinfang's "The Four Scholars" for its "dragon-like roar and tiger-like howl" and "vivid depiction," which made people never tire of watching it, I concentrated and went to appreciate Ma's style. The special point of Ma's style is the addition of two scenes: before writing the indictment in Willow Forest, there is an extra scene of planning harm; after the second court hearing, there is an extra scene of suffering in prison. Whether these two scenes should be added is not worth discussing.

As for Zhou Xinfang's "The Four Scholars," the most important thing is "acting," which is deeply moving. Some people say: Xinfang's opera has a large audience. This is true, but the vast majority of the audience are not from the bourgeoisie. Most of them use hard-earned money to find pleasure in hardship and appreciate true art. Xinfang has been performing alone for many years, repeatedly posting this play, and it is often full, which is truly commendable! To say that "The Four Scholars" is the supreme masterpiece of the Qi School is the fairest comment.

### "Princess Iron Fan" Officially Begins Filming

‚Äî Taigong

The Wan brothers are collaborating with "Guolian" to produce the full-length cartoon "Princess Iron Fan." Since the work began two months ago, the entire "Princess Iron Fan" has now been drawn and officially started filming. The Wan brothers' privately owned "cartoon automatic filming machine" has been transported to Dingxiang Garden. According to the Wan brothers, the machine was purchased from an American five or six years ago. In China, it can be said that there is only one such machine. The parts are very complex, and the machine itself is extremely large, occupying more than twenty feet of land. The upper part of the machine is equipped with a filming camera, which can automatically film. The steel frame is more than two zhang long and can be freely moved up, down, left, and right to distinguish between distant and close views. Above the filming camera, there is a round shaft that can be freely rotated during filming. There are four layers of lights to distinguish between strong and weak. The scenery can also be divided into four layers. During filming, four or five photographers are required to manage the machine. Just by pressing the switch, the filming camera can automatically film the drawings one by one. The directors are Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan.

### Li Qinian - Waiting for a Ship to Shanghai

Li Qinian has sent a letter to Shanghai, stating that he is waiting for a ship to come north in Hong Kong and plans to leave Hong Kong within a week. However, it is currently more difficult to book cabin seats, so it is unpredictable whether he can depart as scheduled. As for which ship he will take, the Hong Kong authorities do not allow prior announcements, so it is also impossible to know. Li Qinian has asked the Yi Hua authorities to rent a small Western-style building for him to stay in, as he is said to be unaccustomed to hotel life. In short, Li Qinian's every move and every word will surely refresh our minds and eyes and is most favored by the press in Hong Kong.

### Unprecedented Grand Event. The Shaoxing County Relief Donation Committee Sponsors. Grand Performance of Eight Women's Yue Opera Troupes

‚Äî Jian Ming

Held at the Carlton Theater on August 1st

The Shaoxing Seven County Fellow Association, sponsored by the Shaoxing County Relief Donation Committee, has been intensifying its work in various groups since its establishment. The fourth joint meeting of the committee members was held the night before last, and Huang Yuzhai, the director of the general affairs group of the association, hosted a banquet to entertain the gentlemen present. It was resolved that the entertainment assembly in charge of the entertainment group would be advanced and the date would be determined. The famous Shanghai amateur performers and actors‚Äô broadcasting concert will be held continuously on the 22nd and 23rd. The grand performance of eight women's Yue opera troupes is scheduled for August 1st and 2nd for a total of two days. The venue has been provisionally set at the Carlton Theater. Whether famous actors or famous amateurs, they are all eager to help the public and care about their compatriots. Once contacted, they all readily agreed, and their enthusiasm is admirable.

Grand Performance of Eight Women's Yue Opera Troupes

Since women's Yue opera became popular due to Yao Shuijuan, Tu Xinghua, and others, theater owners have all shifted their attention and have successively changed to performing women's Yue opera to suit the needs of the audience. Yue opera has then sprung up and presented an extremely vigorous appearance. However, since women's Yue opera was introduced to Shanghai, there has been no grand performance of a joint performance until now. This time, the famous actors from various theaters are enthusiastic about public welfare and care about their hometowns. They united and held a grand joint performance of eight troupes for the first time. The magnitude of the momentum will surely break the record of joint performances. Last night, Huang Yuzhai, Wei Jinsan, the director of the Yue opera group, and Pei Zhenyong hosted a banquet at the Huizhong Union Club, inviting prominent figures from Shaoxing County and the backstage managers of the eight major Yue opera troupes. In addition to discussing various important matters, the programs for the day and night performances on August 1st and 2nd were decided by drawing lots to arrange Groups A and B in advance. Looking at the main characters arranged, they are all rare talents in the women's Yue opera world. And the excellent plays performed on both days and nights are successful masterpieces of the famous actors. The programs arranged for the two days and nights are recorded here to share with friends who love women's Yue opera. I sincerely hope that the seven county fellows will not miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
