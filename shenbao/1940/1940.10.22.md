### Chinese Troops on Anhui Border Repeatedly Score Victories; Langxi and Qianshan Both Reported Recovered; Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangxi Advance to Ganzhou Market after Capturing Fengxin; Japanese Suffer Heavy Losses and are Retreating towards Anyi

Tunxi:  Chinese troops on the Anhui-Jiangsu border launched a counter-offensive towards Langxi. On the 19th, they pressed close to the outskirts of the city. At midnight, they charged into the city and engaged in fierce street fighting throughout the night. The Japanese were unable to withstand the assault and collapsed. The county town of Langxi was thus reported to be recovered. (Dispatch of the 21st)

Lihuang:  On the morning of the 18th, several dozen Japanese troops, a mix of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, arrived at the outskirts of Qianshan city and engaged in fierce fighting with the defending Chinese troops. Around 10 o'clock, the Japanese briefly broke into the city. On the morning of the 19th at 2 o'clock, the Chinese troops began to encircle and attack the Japanese. One unit of brave soldiers broke into the city and engaged in street fighting, while another unit attacked the Japanese from outside the city. The fighting continued until around 10 o'clock, when the Japanese, unable to withstand the pressure, fled southeast. Qianshan was thus completely recovered by the Chinese troops. (Dispatch of the 20th)

Gao'an:  The Chinese troops who recovered Fengxin continued their eastward pursuit on the 19th and 20th to expand their victory. On the 20th, the Chinese troops had advanced to the vicinity of Ganzhou Market. The Japanese are collapsing towards Anyi. The situation before Fengxin has returned to the state it was in thirteen days ago. (Dispatch of the 21st)

Gao'an:  Since the Chinese troops launched a counter-offensive against Nanchang last month and inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army in Northern Jiangxi, the Japanese have been attempting to take retaliatory action against China since February. Starting from the 13th, they gathered 3,000 troops from various parts of Northern Jiangxi and launched a fierce attack on Fengxin and the northwest region from Anyi. After being met with a head-on and painful blow by the Chinese, they suffered heavy losses. One unit fled into Fengxin city. The Chinese troops immediately eliminated the remaining Japanese west of Fengxin and, at the same time, joined forces from all directions to launch a large-scale siege against the remaining Japanese in Fengxin city. After three days and nights of intense fighting, they attacked and entered Fengxin city on the morning of the 18th. The fierce fighting continued until 3 p.m., when the Japanese collapsed and retreated towards Anyi. In total, it is estimated that over 2,000 Japanese were killed in this operation. Numerous machine guns, rifles, horses, ammunition, and other spoils of war were captured. It is noted that Fengxin was originally a major stronghold on the outer perimeter west of Japanese-occupied Nanchang. Since it was recovered by the Chinese, the Japanese forces in Nanchang and Anyi have felt threatened. This time, they concentrated all their efforts to try to regain the stronghold of Fengxin in order to complete their pincer formation. This attempt has now been shattered by the Chinese.

According to the documents, the Japanese planes' air raid on the Yunnan-Burma Road on Sunday morning included several bridges in Yunnan province with military value.

Chongqing, as the central location, should hold the event enthusiastically. It has now been decided to invite central and local agencies and organizations to form a preparatory committee to manage the event. (Dispatch of the 11th)

### Japanese Southern Advance Policy Likely to Slow Down

Chongqing: Well-informed sources here are convinced that Japan's southward expansion policy will proceed slowly. It is said that this is not the first time Japan has succumbed to strong foreign pressure. Japan originally planned to obtain gains without fighting, but once Britain and the United States exposed its bluff, it would back down, because it is actually unable to risk a major war with Britain and the United States. As for the Soviet Union immediately concluding a non-aggression pact with Japan, that is highly doubtful. Although the Soviet Union wants to see the major powers fight each other, it must be certain that the outcome of this action will promote war between the United States and Japan before it will do so. Since there are few signs of war between the United States and Japan, the Soviet Union may not sign such a treaty with Japan. The negotiations for the Soviet-German pact, although they lasted for several months, were only signed on the eve of Germany's invasion of Poland, which is one example. It is expected that there will be no developments in the Far East for the time being, pending the outcome of the European war. (Reuter's dispatch)

Editorial

### The Question of Whether the U.S. and Japan Will Go to War

From the perspective of world war, among the international powers at present, those that are truly close to the vortex of war and can be considered problematic are Turkey and Greece, the United States, and the Soviet Union. There is no doubt that these countries, in their intentions, policies, and the direction of their efforts, are completely the same as China and Britain before the outbreak of the war, all hoping to avoid war. But will they ultimately be different from China and Britain and avoid war? Or will they inevitably follow in the footsteps of China and Britain, forced to engage in war? No one can predict. The attitude of the Soviet Union is certainly one of the important keys, and the most far-reaching and influential is the United States. The United States is preparing with the greatest determination and the highest courage to cope with a two-ocean war. In the current situation, the focus is not on the Atlantic but on the Pacific; in other words, the urgent matter is not against Germany and Italy but against Japan. In the blink of an eye before and after the announcement of the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Japanese government and public were calling for a showdown with the United States. However, after the United States' reaction to the Pact showed its strength and vigor, Japan suddenly restrained its attitude. Superficial observers of international affairs, therefore, hastily believed that Japan had softened and was about to temporarily remain dormant. In fact, this is just one of Japan's many acts of posing and is not enough to be seen as evidence of softening or changing. The Japanese government and public have never expressed that they can respect the international order or respect the interests of other countries, and they have never accepted the United States' proposal to maintain the status quo. Even if their posture appears soft, it is only a posture. In principle, as long as Japan does not correct its attitude, that is, as long as it does not soften its actual actions, the factors that drive US-Japan relations from confrontation and sharpness to war will remain unmitigated.

So, in the face of the United States' strength and vigor, does Japan ultimately have the courage to act tough, that is, will it ultimately soften or not? Yesterday's newspaper carried a dispatch from San Francisco. When the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to Chile, Ishii Michitaka, passed through San Francisco, he claimed that "a war between the United States and Japan is impossible, because the purpose of Japan's participation in the Axis alliance is to avoid conflict between the United States and Japan." He also said that "there are still many ways for US-Japan cooperation, and there is ample time to find ways to improve all the current difficulties." Ishii also stated that this talk was published on the instructions of Foreign Minister Matsuoka, to show that what he said was not just diplomatic rhetoric from a diplomat, but the view of the Japanese diplomatic authorities. Precisely because it was published on the instructions of Foreign Minister Matsuoka, and it coincided with a time when the attitude of the United States was becoming increasingly firm and active and US-Japan relations were becoming increasingly tense, we should take a closer look. What we learn is that it is not difficult to find that there may be several different interpretations of his words. Japan fears that the United States will adhere to its policies, continue its aid to China and Britain, and that the United States will actually engage in war with Germany, Italy, or Japan due to conflicting interests. Therefore, Japan has concluded a pact with Germany and Italy, attempting to stop the United States' advancement and block its aid. Japan is hoping that this attempt will be successful, and that the cause and effect of concluding an alliance with Germany and Italy is to avoid a US-Japan war. From this perspective, Ishii's talk published on orders is not without its sincerity. The world can see the Japanese heart through Ishii's talk. This is one interpretation. In fact, after Japan formed an alliance with Germany and Italy, the United States responded with several powerful new actions. From the President, Secretary of State, and Secretaries of the Army and Navy to newspaper commentary and public opinion, the United States has also exposed Japan's attempt to form an alliance and expressed anger. Thus, it is no different from the Japanese government and public being told directly. It does not allow the Tokyo Foreign Minister and his foreign envoys to pretend to be deaf and dumb and say that the alliance is a good intention to avoid war with the United States. However, Matsuoka still ordered Ishii to say such things, probably because he knew what to fear, so he had to suddenly change his plan, engage in disguising his original attempt, and try to appease the Americans. Japan has automatically started to ease American feelings and US-Japan relations. It is foreseeable that this is the prelude to softening its actual actions and an indication of a request for a US diplomatic turnaround. This is another interpretation. According to the former interpretation, although Japan's actions are enough to provoke a US-Japan war, its original intention is only wishful thinking and empty threats, and it does not want to fight the United States. According to the latter interpretation, Japan is aware of the disadvantages of fighting the United States and fears war, so it has changed its attitude and policies.

Who can trust or be satisfied with this type of explanation?

In Ishii's talk published on orders, perhaps only one sentence can be regarded as the true intention, namely, the so-called ample time. The greater motivation for the talk is to attempt to prolong the time until the final decision on US-Japan relations. After the announcement of the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the United States' military deployment, diplomatic activities, and economic adjustments have truly been high-profile and swift. Britain, on the other hand, can cooperate wholeheartedly and keep pace. Following this dynamic direction, the speed of progress clearly indicates that in the near future, it has the possibility of launching any large-scale new action. This is something that Japan is struggling to cope with and cannot accept. The Japanese authorities may be blinded by greed, like to exaggerate, or be deceived by years of propaganda to the people. The situation is like riding a tiger, so even though the resistance from the United States is in front of them, they do not know regret, and they are unable to return. Therefore, they still want to use diplomatic rhetoric, lay a soft smokescreen, and try to anesthetize, hoping to gain ample time through time maneuvering. What is the advantage of time, and what is it waiting for? First, they still hope that the United States will continue its empty words and deeds, so that Japan can carry out its military conquest against China and complete its aggression. Second, they still hope that all of the United States' actions will stagnate at the current stage, so that Germany and Italy can defeat Britain first. The essence of the two is nothing more than hoping that time can save them, allowing Germany and Italy and Japan to implement their strategy of defeating the entire international community one by one; hoping that the Americans will be tolerant, that the United States will be indifferent, and that they will accept Japan's soft-spoken and gentle sophistry, and in fact grant them time. Truly, if Japan gains a decisive victory in its use of force in China, and after Britain is defeated by Germany and Italy and the empire collapses, the United States will inevitably be unable to help China and Britain and the entire changing situation, and will only cry out in despair. At that time, Matsuoka does not have to order Ishii to retract this talk, and he will naturally be able to restore his hideous original appearance. Why should he fear challenging the United States, and why should he seek to avoid war! In short, if Japan does not realize the truth, US-Japan relations will never be restored. If the United States does not take effective measures to stop it now, Japan will not realize the truth, which means that only a matter of time remains before US-Japan war. Today's Japan only hopes that the United States will give it the opportunity to choose the most favorable time for Japan to fight the United States.

### Thai Prime Minister Threatens Vietnam: Will Launch Blitzkrieg if Territorial Demands are Rejected

Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Songgram yesterday called on the public to remain calm during the current crisis in French Indochina, but the Prime Minister also issued a threatening statement, saying that if the French do not accept Thailand's territorial demands, Thailand will launch a blitzkrieg against Vietnam. The Prime Minister at the time advised the people to remain calm and await the government's decision. He also stated that the French delegation that is about to arrive here must have the authority to resolve Thailand's territorial claims, otherwise the delegation will not be accepted by the Thai government. According to previous reports, the delegation only has the authority to discuss the issue of the Mekong River border. The Prime Minister declared yesterday, "Even if we can obtain a reasonable settlement on the Mekong River, it still cannot show that the unfair treatment that the French gave us in the past has been completely resolved. We have decided to retake the lost territories, and we will definitely achieve our goal. We are currently trying to resolve the issue without resorting to force, but once we have to resort to force, we will try to conduct the war with the least amount of bloodshed." Several thousand Thai farmers held a demonstration march at the Ministry of Defense yesterday to express their support for the use of force against Vietnam. The farmers were carrying rice, bananas, coconuts, and other agricultural products, indicating that they would supply these items to the people during the war.

As for the prohibition of transportation and sales, it has also been strictly enforced, and the results are very good. (Dispatch of the 20th)

### Balkan Region Threatened by War: Britain Intensifies Diplomatic Activities

British Envoys in Turkey and Bulgaria in Close Contact; Soviet Union Denies Secret Negotiations with Turkey

London: Romania is now effectively under the iron heel of the German army. The focus of the situation at the end of this week has shifted southwards to Turkey, Bulgaria, and Greece. The British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, has now traveled to the Turkish capital to discuss everything with the British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen. Before leaving Sofia, Rendel had a lengthy audience with the Bulgarian King, allowing him to inform Knatchbull-Hugessen of the King's attitude toward the new developments in the Balkans. Considering the fierce attacks on the Bulgarian King in the German newspapers, King Boris's attitude can be inferred. At the same time, Knatchbull-Hugessen has also met with the Turkish Foreign Minister, Saraçoğlu, and can inform Rendel of Turkey's reaction to the continued Axis advance in the Balkans. Undoubtedly, Turkey's reaction will depend on the Soviet Union's attitude. The Soviet Union remains silent, but Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held talks with the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union in the middle of last week. The Soviet Ambassador to Turkey also met with Turkish President İnönü, which is of great significance. Turkey remains calm and watches the development of the situation carefully, while preparing everything to protect its vital interests. The Axis powers are currently spreading smoke screens in the Balkans, disseminating rumors that the Axis powers have presented an ultimatum to Greece and that Greek Prime Minister Metaxas has resigned. The Axis powers undoubtedly hope that Greece will follow Romania's example and submit, but Greece, having seen Romania's fate, may not be willing to fall into the trap, especially since Greece has Britain's naval guarantee. The reports of German troops entering Bulgaria have not been confirmed, but there are many reports of German tourists entering Bulgaria. Germany is now trying to lure Bulgaria with an outlet to the Aegean Sea that is unfavorable to Greece, as a reward for Bulgaria imitating Romania. However, is it not a losing proposition to sacrifice sovereignty for this price? (Reuters, 21st)

London: The London Daily Express reported this morning that Greece has rejected Italy's demand to sever Anglo-Greek commercial relations for the third time. The Greek government has not issued any statement regarding the rejection of Italy's demands, in order to avoid a public diplomatic dispute with Italy. The Daily Express also stated that Greece is currently rushing to prepare defenses against a possible Axis attack. (International Telegram, 21st)

Istanbul: Well-informed sources here have learned that British diplomats held negotiations in Istanbul, attended by the air and naval attachés of the British embassies in Romania and Turkey. Political circles here believe that political and military issues were discussed. During the negotiations, the Greek Ambassador to Turkey maintained constant contact with the British Embassy. It is also learned that the issue of evacuating British nationals from the Balkans was also discussed. According to sources close to the British Embassy, the British Embassy seems quite disappointed with Turkey's reserved attitude. Judging from the current situation in the Balkans and the attitude expressed in the Turkish newspapers, Britain clearly hopes that Turkey will take a stronger stance. Diplomatic circles here speculate that Turkey's reserved attitude is due to the Soviet Union's lack of a clear position, which is causing great confusion for the Turkish government. Sources here suggest that due to British initiative, a conference of diplomats from Britain, Turkey, and Greece may soon be convened in Ankara to discuss political and military issues related to the three countries. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)

Sofia: The conference of British diplomatic representatives in the Balkan countries in Istanbul and the visit of British War Minister Eden to Cairo have attracted great attention in Bulgaria. Although the British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen, has clearly stated that he only met with the British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, in Istanbul, the recent extraordinary activities of British diplomats in the Balkans have aroused suspicion among the Bulgarian people. The Newnik newspaper reported that Eden's trip to Cairo and Knatchbull-Hugessen's talks in Istanbul must be directly related, being Britain's last effort to draw Turkey and Greece into the Allied forces. The Slovo newspaper stated that Britain's attempts in this regard are doomed to failure, and that the Balkan countries wish to maintain neutrality under all circumstances and will use all means to oppose Britain's conspiracy. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)

Moscow: "United Press of America's Istanbul correspondent claims: 'Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Akhtay had a secret meeting with Stalin on October 18.'" TASS has recently issued an official statement declaring that the above report is completely untrue. (TASS Telegram, 21st)

Ankara: The Turkish National Community Party's official newspaper published an article yesterday warning the Balkan countries, advising them to follow Romania's example as soon as possible and join the Rome-Berlin Axis. This move coincides with the extraordinary measures currently being taken here to prevent British air raids on the capital. The authorities have also issued an order that from today onwards, people are not allowed to walk on the streets from midnight to dawn. It is also learned that this curfew will be implemented indefinitely. (United Press Telegram, 21st)

Ankara: According to reports here, Turkish President İsmet İnönü will deliver a speech at the opening of the parliament on November 1, reporting on the domestic and foreign situation. People here attach great importance to this speech. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 21st)

Yugoslavian Capital: Regarding the German official statement denying rumors of strained relations between Germany, Yugoslavia, and Turkey, the newspapers here have published it prominently. According to the German official statement, relations between Germany and the aforementioned three countries have not only not become strained but have become closer. The newspapers in Yugoslavia mentioned the signing of the German-Yugoslav trade agreement on the 19th of this month, which can be regarded as a symbol of this closeness. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 21st)

### Oil-Producing Regions of Romania Guarded Against Sabotage; Romanian Army Borrows Funds to Purchase Military Supplies

### Soviet Union Revises Labor Law

Moscow: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order today, revising the current labor law. The main provision is that industrial leaders throughout the country can transfer technicians and workers from one factory to another for production needs, regardless of the distance, but workers with low wages and no special skills can still choose their place of service. Therefore, if technicians and workers in various factories disobey orders and refuse to transfer to designated factories, they will be punished for desertion under the law promulgated on July 26, 1940. However, technicians and workers who are ordered to relocate can be subsidized for travel expenses by the government, whether they bring their families or not. Observers believe that the Soviet authorities have taken this measure because they have realized that allowing workers to freely choose their place of work has been harmful to the development of national industry.

Sexual Health

### Husband Suffers from Kidney Deficiency; Disharmonious Atmosphere in the Bedroom Deteriorates

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Healthy Sexual Function Can Harmonize a Couple's Personalities; Otherwise, Both Parties Suffer

Sexual desire holds great and profound potential in people's daily lives. It can dominate the environment, transform a dull and lonely life into a joyful and happy realm, harmonize the personalities of a couple, help each other, and jointly maintain family peace. Furthermore, what aspect of evolution, reproduction of mankind, etc., can lack sexual desire?

Although sexual function is a human instinct, it can be said that healthy people do not lack this sexual function. If this sexual function has any pathology, it is undoubtedly kidney deficiency. Once a husband suffers from kidney deficiency, both the husband himself and his wife will feel a very significant blow. Because the defects of sexual function often turn loving couples into hatred, and in severe cases, the only way out is divorce.

The disease of kidney deficiency affects countless men and women. It has indeed become a very serious problem. There are many types of obstacles, such as impotence, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, infertility, etc., which all cause patients to be very depressed.

Speaking of the treatment of kidney deficiency, as long as the prosperity of the youth glands that govern sexual desire can be increased and the function of metabolism can be promoted, health can be restored. Therefore, the only targeted treatment is to take the German genuine youth gland hormone preparation for men, "Boticam." It can cure the disease because our testicles are a kind of endocrine fluid. The function of endocrine is to excrete its secretion into the blood, transport it throughout the body, regulate the rise and fall of the whole body, and maintain the prosperity of the body. For kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, impotence, infertility, and other symptoms caused by excessive sex and self-inflicted wounds, "Boticam," an endocrine preparation for the testicles (i.e., youth glands), can be taken to replenish the kidneys, brain, and blood, with miraculous effects. Its use in women to regulate menstruation and seed is trusted by doctors.

### Example of the Latest Spermatorrhea Therapy

— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Although there are many types of spermatorrhea therapy, the one that our doctors have found most effective is the use of oral medications. However, there are too many types of spermatorrhea medicine on the market, and their ingredients are also different. The best one is the German "Niles Spermatorrhea Pills." Now, let's cite an example to prove its effectiveness.

Patient Xia, 19 years old, started masturbating at the age of 16 and then felt spermatorrhea, involuntary emission, incomplete development, headaches, insomnia, and other symptoms. Although he took over-the-counter medicines on the market, they were all ineffective. Then, the doctor prescribed "Niles Spermatorrhea Pills," three pills to be taken only once a day (before bed), and also German testicular endocrine preparations to make up for the loss, three times a day. After a month, not only did the spermatorrhea stop permanently, but also development was promoted, and the brainpower was refreshed. This proves that these two medicines are the most targeted treatment for spermatorrhea.

### How to Completely Eradicate Rapidly Spreading Gonorrhea

— Dr. Wang Kechun, American Medical Doctor

The human body is an integrated whole; one hair can move the entire body. Therefore, when one part is invaded by bacteria, the entire body feels pain. Generally, people believe that gonorrhea is a localized problem, and treatments only focus on localized sterilization, neglecting the overall issue. This has resulted in many inferior drugs with only adverse reactions and no sterilizing power. Most of the inferior drugs on the market only focus on membrane penetration for sterilization, and this type of sterilization is only temporary and superficial. There is absolutely no real, fundamental effect. For many years, after consulting the latest European and American medical materials for treating gonorrhea, I must recommend the latest chemical therapy "Klinon" announced by Dr. Peter of Germany. This agent is based on the principle of chemical therapy with the unit of eradicating gonorrhea. This agent aims to purely eliminate gonorrhea bacteria, which is incomparable to other chemical therapies for treating gonorrhea in conjunction. Therefore, "Klinon" has extremely strong sterilizing power and absolutely no chemical therapy reactions. Therefore, "Klinon" is highly effective for all acute and chronic gonorrhea, such as gonorrheal anterior and posterior urethritis, orchitis, prostatitis, arthritis, cystitis, etc. Its success rate is above 98%. For rapidly spreading gonorrhea and highly dangerous gonorrheal toxins, taking "Klinon" (available in major pharmacies) is exceptionally effective.

### The Harm of Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Tuberculosis is the most virulent disease that robs human lives and is a great enemy to human prosperity. Therefore, people with lung disease should seek treatment early. Once the lungs lose their health, tuberculosis will worsen daily, leading to mental fatigue, night sweats, and decreased appetite. Subsequently, chest pain and coughing will occur, accompanied by a sallow complexion and emaciation, coughing up phlegm and blood, tinnitus, headaches, insomnia, palpitations, shortness of breath, and difficulty sleeping. If only symptomatic treatments are used, although they can suppress superficial symptoms, the tuberculosis bacteria will still exist, making reproduction easier and causing more complications. However, the drug "Bu Fei Naer" (Lung Supplement Naer) has truly different effects because it can eradicate tuberculosis bacteria, shrink lesions, and restore eroded lung cavities to their original state. This is the most ideal oral medication for lung disease. As for coughing, taking this medication can relieve coughing and eliminate phlegm within three hours, with guaranteed effectiveness.

### Gonorrhea Lecture

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

Unbearable to Recall Consolation When Happiness Was!

Many cases of gonorrhea are easily curable, but they often become difficult-to-cure chronic leukorrhea due to missed opportunities. It is truly "exchanging a moment of pleasure for a lifetime of regret." Recalling the times of bright lights and green wine, it is truly unbearable to recall. In fact, there is always the possibility of contracting venereal diseases when engaging in such activities. As long as treatment is effective, there is no reason why it cannot be cured. Because science is now advanced, unlike in the 19th century, once infected, one would be trapped by this disease and unable to escape. In fact, science is now greatly advanced, and there is absolute certainty of curing such acute and chronic gonorrhea. Taking modern oral medications, there is the special gonorrhea drug "Klinon" (available in major pharmacies), which can produce anti-gonorrheal phagocytic action and a powerful analgesic effect, so the radical cure of gonorrhea can be quickly realized. With over 20 years of clinical experience, I also find that "Klinon" is superior to the inferior drugs that have been on the market in the past and present. I also use German induced electrostatic therapy, ice compress therapy, etc., which makes spring healing even easier. Treating syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, chancroid, and sexual neurasthenia. Twenty patients are admitted daily, with a registration fee of only five jiao per patient.

### French Coastal Ports Fiercely Bombed by British Air Force; British and German Cannons Exchange Fire Across the Strait; German Aircraft Groups Fly High to Invade Britain

Dover, last night until this morning, large squadrons of British air force, resembling swarms of bees, crossed the English Channel, carrying out the most intense attacks on German forces in the various ports of French territory. The Hitler invasion base was given a very large destruction, countless tons of bombs, like a torrential rain, with a bombing amount reaching more than one hundred pieces per minute. The terrible destruction almost spread to the French coastal area. Before the British Air Force implemented the fierce bombing, the exchange of fire between the British and German cannons across the sea had shown an unprecedented tension. The attack by the British Air Force began at seven o'clock in the afternoon. At that time, the sound of bomb explosions was like thunder, and both sides of the coast shook. All the glass windows in the coastal areas of Kent trembled and made urgent noises, and many furnishings in the houses were also knocked down and destroyed by the shock. On Sunday afternoon, German long-range cannons fired fifty shots at the residential area of Dover. Several good houses, a hotel, and a church in the area were hit, killing one person and seriously injuring two. At sunset, the German long-range cannons fired two more rounds of shots. Afterwards, the British Air Force showed its power on the French coast, without rest until noon. Every ten or twelve minutes, a new squadron of British aircraft replaced the old ones. In the five hours from dusk to midnight, the German positions on the French coast suffered countless bombs, perhaps thousands. After each terrifying British aircraft bombing, there was a ten-minute break. Ten minutes later, another team of British aircraft arrived, and all the British aircraft seemed to be emptying their baskets, throwing all the bombs they carried at the German base. Although the Strait was shrouded in thick fog, making it difficult to clearly see the explosion of British aircraft bombs on the other side, the sky last night was bright and moonlit, which greatly aided the British aircraft's air raid. Last night, thousands of residents gathered on the beach, looking up and admiring the attack of the British Air Force. They said that such weather was a good opportunity for German aircraft to attack Britain. However, the British Air Force had already taken the lead. Yesterday, a Messerschmitt aircraft was shot down over this area, and the German pilot was slightly injured. He parachuted into the field and was captured by farmers. Yesterday morning, British long-range cannons fired more than twenty shots at the German fleet attempting to depart from Calais to Poland. British air reconnaissance aircraft also indicated the location of the fleet from the air to facilitate the attack by the artillery. Due to heavy fog and frost, the effect of the artillery attack could not be seen. The loud sound of the British long-range cannons caused the entire city of Dover to shake. Before noon, the British long-range artillery team attacking the German fleet, along with another artillery team, carried out the largest artillery attack since the war in response to the German artillery fire entering the English ships in the port of Dover. The guns of the British artillery team were fired at Cape Gris-Nez. When the German army fired artillery, two or three shells fell into the water off the coast of Dover every few minutes. Although the situation in the strait could not be seen due to the fog, the Germans seemed to be blindly bombarding all British ships passing through the strait. On the same day, many German bombers and fighter jets flew to the vicinity of Dover, but were immediately driven away by British Spitfires. The Spitfire squadrons also flew across the strait and vigorously pursued the German aircraft. Yesterday, the anti-aircraft guns here fired frequently, because individual German aircraft sometimes flew to the location, seemingly wanting to bomb the British artillery positions. It was heard that at least two German bombers were shot down. One of them swayed and fell towards the sea, and then disappeared into the fog, never to be seen again. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

Berlin. A Huitong News Agency reporter has learned that German aircraft dropped more than 500 tons of bombs in various parts of Britain in the past 24 hours. Along the way, they encountered very few British fighter planes. No German aircraft were lost, and all safely returned to their original defense. (Huitong dispatch, 21st)

London. Today's Air Ministry communique states that two enemy aircraft were destroyed last night. The enemy's nighttime air raid mainly targeted the London area and the Midlands. The London area suffered considerable damage to buildings, and several fires broke out. Several people were killed and injured. In the Midlands, only one city was most heavily bombed, with houses, schools, and shops destroyed in many places, and several people killed and injured. Although other places were also bombed by enemy aircraft, the damage and injuries were extremely slight. Yesterday, seven German aircraft were shot down, and three British aircraft were destroyed, but all the pilots escaped safely. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

London. Yesterday, after the British artillery bombarded across the Dover Strait, the German artillery retaliated fiercely for two hours, causing the glass windows in a large area of the British side to be shattered. However, as a whole, the material damage was very minor. It is estimated that only one person was killed and two were injured. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

London. In today's house raid, the headquarters of the Youth Association here was hit by a high-explosive bomb, suffering great damage. Four or five hundred members who were sheltering in the gymnasium were fortunate to escape safely. Most of the houses are no longer habitable. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

London. Reuters Air Force reporter said that the German Air Force is now gradually using semi-stratospheric altitudes in the British "white book" aircraft. This is another consequence of the German side's attempt to break through British defenses with a large number of daytime bombers under fighter protection, which ultimately failed. The German side sent fighter-bombers to carry out this offensive, with single-seat fighters also carrying bombs as assistance. However, this offensive relies entirely on rapid flight and the greatest possible use of cloud cover to launch surprise attacks. However, during this "second summer" weather in Britain, there is not enough cloud cover to rely on, so German aircraft have to seek rapid flight and high altitude. When enemy aircraft cross the coast to London, the general altitude is above 30,000 feet, more than five miles above the ground, making interception difficult. This is because the mobility of British defending fighters decreases greatly when flying over this altitude, and the handling is quite uncomfortable. German aircraft flying to altitudes above 30,000 feet are far away from the range of ground artillery fire. In addition, there are more enemy aircraft. This is why the German Air Force has suffered less loss in recent times, and sometimes the number of British aircraft lost is not greater than that of German aircraft. Recently, the German side has been using Messerschmitt 109 and 110 aircraft to harass Britain, which has greatly reduced the area of their attacks. For example, on Sunday, the activity of German aircraft was almost limited to the southeast corner, and they carried few bombs, so the damage they could inflict on Britain was also minimal. If the German side can constantly fly to various places from the south coast to London and immediately escape after attacking, then this method is quite valuable in harassment. In addition, they also repeatedly flew to Britain for night raids, so that the inner and outer defenses of London were always on alert, and the public often entered and exited air raid shelters and could not rest peacefully. Undoubtedly, this is one of the main goals of the German side. The British Air Force staff officers are now paying close attention to this matter. According to reason, the British side will not dispatch reserve fighter squadrons to make up for the difference in the number of aircraft, but will use a type of aircraft with extremely high rate of climb and high endurance in the new fighters, so that the German aircraft in night raids will be eclipsed. German aircraft coming in daylight have now added thicker armor for protection. This German safety measure has not escaped the attention of British Air Force strategists. The British side will definitely respond with weapons with greater armor-piercing power. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

London. German aircraft flew high yesterday, mostly wreaking havoc in southeastern Britain. The Air Ministry communique stated that the material damage and casualties were not significant. A total of seven German aircraft were shot down yesterday, one of which was a Messerschmitt fighter-bomber, which was shot down in a street in London. Most of the attacking enemy aircraft were fighters or fighter-bombers. In the morning and afternoon, several teams crossed the coast of Kent and flew towards London and the Thames Estuary. Some of them broke into the London area. Bombs fell in London, Kent, and Wessex. There was little activity of enemy aircraft in other parts of Britain, and no bombs were reported to have been dropped. The enemy aircraft tried to harass London five times via the Thames Estuary, but were intercepted by British fighters. After the enemy aircraft were bombed by the Thames Estuary's artillery, they fought fiercely three times with the intercepting British aircraft over the two towns. The enemy fighters tried to break through the barrage balloons over the port of Dover three times, but without success, they were driven away by ground artillery fire. In the afternoon, in addition to a yellow-nosed Messerschmitt German aircraft being shot down in a street in London and its pilot also dying, another enemy aircraft was pursued by British fighters, with smoke coming from its engine, and fled towards French territory. According to German official news agencies, Berlin claimed that German aircraft shot down nine British aircraft in an attack on Britain on Sunday. Three German aircraft did not return to their base. The German aircraft that carried out the attack hit important military facilities in London and a military camp in southwestern Britain with bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

London. The British Embassy was damaged in the recent London night raid. A time bomb fell near the embassy and then exploded, shattering some doors and windows. However, all the personnel on duty at the time were safe and sound. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### British Bomber Squadrons Break Through Berlin's Air Defenses and Bomb Northern Italy Extensively; Bombs Rain Down on Berlin's Residential Areas

Berlin. Early this morning, British bombers broke through Berlin's air defenses, causing the German capital to suffer an unprecedentedly severe attack. British aircraft dropped incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs on residential areas in Berlin, as dense as rain and avalanches. Since the British aircraft bombed Berlin, this was also the strongest attack ever. Although hundreds of searchlights and anti-aircraft guns fired together, the British aircraft still swooped down and unloaded their batches of bombs. The 4 million residents of Berlin stayed in air raid shelters all night, not sleeping. Even until dawn this morning, although the German anti-aircraft fire was fierce, the British aircraft rumbled over Berlin all night without leaving. German officials said that when the British aircraft bombed, two aircraft were shot down. The Germans said that the purpose of this British air raid was to "intimidate" because "only incendiary bombs were used and only residential areas were bombed." The air raids last night and this morning caused several fires, so there must have been many deaths and injuries. (International dispatch, 21st)

London. An Air Ministry communique announced that last night the British Air Force carried out extensive bombing from Berlin to northern Italy. Targets in the above two regions and other parts of Germany were attacked. Aggressive seaports were also bombed. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Subsequently, the enemy's long-range artillery also fired several shots at the French coast. There were no losses on the French side. German light bombers bombed several cities in London and central and southern England. A fire broke out at the oil pool in Thameshaven. There were several air battles yesterday and last night, all of which were won by the German forces. At night, German heavy bombers intensified their bombing of London, and a large number of bombs fell on both banks of the Thames River. Armories in central England and seaports in the west were also severely bombed. Last night, enemy aircraft flew over German territory and dropped bombs in Berlin and other cities. Apart from the destruction of railway tracks in the west, there was no damage to military facilities. Several houses were destroyed, and several civilians were killed or injured. That was all. In total, 19 enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, and one German aircraft went missing. (Huitong dispatch, 21st)

American armaments have made significant progress. American public opinion knows the necessity of assisting Britain. The people of London are calm and orderly despite being bombed. The United States is deeply impressed by this. The American Army authorities have asked American aircraft manufacturers to adopt a fourteen-hour work system per day. He thinks that each factory will comply. He will stay in the central government for three weeks and now needs to go to the Scottish region for a few days of rest before returning to London to report to the government.

### British Air Force Intensifies Attacks on Italian Bases in Libya; Ships Hit in Port of Benghazi

Cairo. British bombers increased their strength at the end of this week, striking Italian bases and ships in Libya. According to last night's communique, on Sunday, British Air Force bombers attacked a row of ships in the port of Benghazi and bombed the barracks in the port, causing a fire. The barracks, telephone exchange, and military headquarters in Benghazi were bombed on Saturday night. Italian barracks and a large number of motor transport vehicles south of Bardia were also bombed.

Also, shortly after midnight on Saturday, the island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf was bombed by four Italian aircraft. However, the material damage was minimal, and there were no casualties.

### American Citizens Urge the Secretary of the Army to Coordinate Air Defense; Recruit Three Million Volunteers to Command Defense Plans

Washington. It was revealed here today that American civil groups are now urging Secretary of the Army Stimson to organize a civil defense department to coordinate methods for underground and indoor air raid preparedness, and relief plans for the major cities of the United States after bombing. This proposal requires the recruitment of three million volunteers to command civil defense plans across the country. It is generally believed that the immediate establishment of this group can allow the US Army to somewhat relieve its responsibility for purely civilian defense plans, and can allow rural residents to safely avoid possible air raids by enemy forces. Officials here today said that the increasing concern across the United States for the civil defense system can be seen in the increase in letters they have sent to the Army Department. Officials also said that the 44th consecutive air raid on London has made the American public aware of air raids. (International News Agency dispatch, 21st)

### Britain and the Netherlands Call on the United States to Jointly Defend the Dutch East Indies; Suggest Using Singapore to Command Naval Battles; Japanese Representative Kobayashi is Scheduled to Return Home Today

Washington. According to news here today, the British and Dutch governments have called on the United States to cooperate in defending the Dutch East Indies, as a condition for prohibiting oil exports to Japan from the Dutch East Indies. Reliable sources say that Britain has suggested that the United States use the Singapore base to command the naval battles needed to defend the Dutch East Indies. It is also said that the call for US assistance and the suggestion to use the Singapore base were conveyed to US Secretary of State Hull by British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian. Since Lothian returned to London last week, talks have stopped. It is generally believed that Lothian was called back to the country because the US government was unwilling to provide precise guarantees to the British requests. At the same time, US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy was also called back to Washington to discuss whether this move could reach a compromise. (International News Agency dispatch, 21st)

### US Interests in Shanghai - Still Determined to Maintain - All Important Businesses Operate as Usual - No Concessions Made on Central District Defense

According to news from the US Consulate yesterday, the US official notice to American nationals in the Far East to withdraw and return home is currently limited to "non-essential personnel." The remaining personnel will not be evacuated for the time being. It is also understood that there are a total of 4,000 American nationals in Shanghai, of which approximately 1,500 are women and children, who will generally wait for ships to return home. However, the remaining employed American men will remain in Shanghai. Although American nationals are extremely concerned about the development of the situation in the Far East, their emotions are calm and there is no sign of anxiety. All important American businesses in Shanghai are operating as usual, and there are no internal changes, which proves that the common speculation about American businesses in this city based on the closure of some American commercial organizations in Tianjin and Beijing is premature. According to well-informed sources, Shanghai is one of the largest areas of American investment in the Far East, and this "economic fortress" will not be abandoned unless absolutely necessary.

Central District Defense - US Highly Concerned

According to reliable news from foreign diplomatic circles yesterday, the US authorities in Washington also regard the issue of defense transfer in the central district of the Shanghai International Settlement as one of the important interests of the United States in the Far East. Although the US government has not yet made representations to Japan on this issue, it is paying close attention to it. Therefore, if Japan does not make concessions on the issue of defense of the Shanghai International Settlement, it will also become an important factor stimulating a strong anti-Japanese sentiment in the US government and public.

British and American Merchant Corps - Continue to be Stationed

According to news from senior officers of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the highest authorities of the Shanghai International Settlement have decided to extend the stationing of the British and American units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the central district for another month. The Shanghai International Settlement authorities originally scheduled the temporary takeover of the central district by the Corps to end on September 16, which was then extended to the end of October, and now it has been extended again to the end of November.

Scheduled Berths - Daily Increase

According to the reporter's investigation yesterday, the President Lines received more than 100 additional applications for scheduled berths from American nationals yesterday, bringing the total to over 4,000. At least 1,800 of these were issued by American nationals in Shanghai, and the rest were from American nationals in other parts of China and Japan. The US Consul General's Office has also received more than 4,000 responses from American nationals in Shanghai to the Office's notices. However, there have been no new developments regarding the progress of the evacuation of American nationals. According to senior officials of the President Lines, in addition to the four ships already announced, no other new ships have been added to the fleet ordered to come to the Far East to evacuate American nationals. As for the President Coolidge, President Pierce, and President Taft, although they are also assisting in the evacuation of American nationals back to the United States, this is not due to emergency measures, as the dates of arrival and departure of these ships from Shanghai will follow the schedule set before the State Department issued the advisory.

Four Ships' Fares - Almost Double

The minimum fares for the four giant postal vessels ordered to come to the Far East to transport American nationals back to the United States are almost double those of the President Taft and President Cleveland of the President Lines. It is understood that the minimum fares from Shanghai to San Francisco are US$395 each for the President Monde and the President Mariposa, while the minimum fare for the President Washington is US$450. At the same time, the minimum fares for the President Taft and other President Lines ships of the same size are only US$200, and even the minimum fare for the President Coolidge is only US$240. Senior officials of the American President Lines explained to reporters that the four postal vessels that are about to come to Shanghai to evacuate American nationals do not have third-class cabins, and these four postal vessels are all of the same class, so they cannot be compared with the President Lines ships.

Hankou American Nationals - First Trip to Shanghai

Reuters dispatch from Hankou on the 21st: The families of the American staff of Standard Oil, consisting of four women and one young child, booked tickets to Shanghai last week, but the ship was requisitioned by the Japanese army to transport troops, resulting in the temporary cancellation of the voyage. The American nationals were delayed for several days and only set out for Shanghai this morning.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Rate Hike - Only Proposed

Due to the deficit in the previous fiscal year's final accounts, the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget for this year implemented an increase in municipal taxes from July of this year. However, since the implementation of the tax increase, prices have not been suppressed, and rice prices and food have soared, forcing the Council's expenditures to exceed the budget again. It is permissible for the allowances of the Council's Chinese and foreign staff to be increased. Therefore, the Council is considering increasing municipal taxes again. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency made inquiries about this matter to relevant parties close to the International Settlement authorities. It is learned that although the authorities have begun to consider the tax increase issue, it will not be implemented at present. However, the Council has to study it in advance due to the budget exceeding expenditures. The date of implementation is still far away, as the Council cannot implement the tax increase issue without authorization. It must be submitted to the ratepayers' annual meeting for approval. Therefore, although the Council is currently considering a tax increase, it will definitely not be implemented before the next ratepayers' annual meeting.

### China National Aviation Corporation Opens - Hong Kong-Shaoguan Air Route

The fare from Hong Kong to Shaoguan is HK$270, and the fare from Shaoguan to Hong Kong is CN¥520. For all details, please inquire at the company's Hong Kong office and China Travel Service.

### Another Batch of British Nationals - Volunteer to Enlist - Scheduled to be Compulsory from Tomorrow

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that there are quite a few British nationals in the city who are volunteering to enlist. Another group is scheduled to leave for Malaya, India, and Britain on Wednesday to serve the country. This is the third batch of British nationals leaving Shanghai to enlist in ten days, totaling eleven people. Three of them will join the British Air Force, and the rest will join the British Army. Another batch of British nationals in Shanghai who are enlisting will postpone their departure to the second half of November due to the irregular schedule of ships.

### French Authorities Express Approval of Foreign Rice Profits

The Price Evaluation Committee of the French Concession Public Works Bureau convened a meeting of the Rice and Grain Sub-Committee at the General Administration Office on Avenue Joffre at 1:00 PM yesterday. All committee members attended and deliberated. In addition to reporting on the committee's affairs, the committee expressed its approval of the Shanghai Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee's proposed 5% profit margin for the sale of foreign rice on the market. Once the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement approves it, it can reply to the Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee to implement it on schedule.

### Resolution of the French Business Water and Electricity Company Strike - All Traffic to Resume Tomorrow - Conditions to be Signed This Afternoon

The French Business Water and Electricity Company's strike continued to be negotiated yesterday afternoon and has been successfully resolved. It is scheduled that the two parties will sign the resumption of work conditions at the company at 6:00 PM today. All buses and trams will officially resume operations tomorrow. The Pingming News Agency reporter went to the company yesterday to wait for the results of the negotiations. The details are as follows:

Negotiation Situation

After the labor and management sides and the Department of Political Affairs held two direct negotiations at the company on the 19th, most of the conditions have been resolved. Only the reinstatement of dismissed workers is still in dispute. Afterwards, the labor and management sides conducted indirect negotiations through mediators, and a satisfactory solution was also negotiated for this issue. It was decided to continue direct negotiations yesterday afternoon. At 5:40 PM, the labor representatives, Shi Jinfu and Zhang Fubao from the Mechanical Department, Pan Lujie, Gao Chengding, Shen Zhiqin, Li Huidin, Gu Xichun, and Gu Jinrong from the Transportation Department, all arrived at the company to negotiate with Director Fafolet and two representatives from the Department of Political Affairs in the compradore's spare room. Both sides were very sincere in their attitude. The discussions lasted for three hours, ending at 7:30 PM.

Resolution Focus

The focus of yesterday's negotiations was concentrated on two points: (1) the reinstatement of dismissed workers; (2) the increase of wages. After the negotiations began, the labor representatives explained the first issue to the management, saying that these dismissed workers were actually dismissed for participating in the strike and organizing groups. Now that both sides have clarified, these workers can be fully reinstated. The management replied that, in order to handle this strike reasonably, it will gradually allow 30 of the 46 dismissed workers to be reinstated, and the rest will be hired after the resumption of work. The labor side was satisfied. Regarding the second issue of wages, the labor side initially insisted on an increase of six yuan, and if a subsidy was increased, it would have to be eight yuan. Finally, in order to show sincerity, it also made concessions. As a result, a subsidy of six yuan was granted. As for other issues, after a short period of discussion, they were all resolved. Both sides were satisfied, so they drafted the establishment conditions, which are scheduled to be signed by both parties at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Work can officially resume tomorrow, and trams and buses can all resume operations tomorrow. All parties are pleased that the strike, which lasted for 27 days, has now been successfully resolved.

### Eastern Zhejiang War Gradually Stabilizes - Zhuji Telecommunications Disconnected

According to reports from the Zhejiang natives in Shanghai, the war situation in Zhuji County has stabilized since the recapture of the county seat on the 19th. The Zhuji County government has returned to the city to work, but the government office buildings in the city have been burned down, and they are now being cleaned up. When Zhuji was lost, another group of Japanese troops harassed Lizhu Town in Shaoxing, and the situation in Shaoxing was tense. After the recapture of Zhuji, this group of Japanese troops, fearing that their rear would be cut off, also retreated rapidly to Xiaoshan. The Shaoxing Bank has not moved, the post office is working as usual, and the telegraph office temporarily suspended commercial telegrams due to the congestion of military telegrams, but has now resumed sending and receiving. Therefore, postal and telegraphic remittances are all smooth and unobstructed. The people of Ningbo have remained calm and have not been affected by the war in the Zhuji and Lin'an areas. However, telephone and telegraph communication between Ningbo and Zhuji have been cut off since the 16th and have not yet been restored. It was slightly damaged during the fierce fighting in the suburbs of Zhuji and has not yet been repaired. According to post office news, although mail to various towns and cities in Zhuji County, such as Zhaojiabu, Baidou, Zhibu, Caota, Paitou, Fengqiao, Tangjiadian, Machege, Yaogongbu, Zaiwang, Sandu, etc., is still being collected and sent as usual, it has obviously been impossible to deliver it due to the unfinished war in the area, and it appears to be at a standstill. However, the post office is determined to load the collected mail onto wheels and transport it to find a way to deliver it nearby. If the recipient has already moved, the original item will be returned to the sender. Therefore, it is hoped that the Zhuji natives in Shanghai will temporarily refrain from delivering mail to their hometown. It is also learned that Da Bei Da Dong Telegraph Office is still receiving and sending Zhuji telegrams as usual, but delivery is difficult.

### Tai Gu Ship Sails South - Shanghai Goods Shipped to Burma in Batches - Restrictions on Taking British Gold Tickets to Yangon - Passengers Landing in Burma Must Have Visas

Since the reopening of the Burma Road, the Shanghai customs brokerage and foreign shipping industries have urgently sought to establish shipping between Shanghai and Yangon. However, there have been no direct scheduled ships between Shanghai and Yangon, and even irregular ships are rare due to the long distance. In the past, most of the goods shipped to Burma were first transshipped to Singapore. Taigu Steamship Company has recently shipped two batches of goods to Singapore for transshipment to Yangon. Today, a third batch is being shipped to Hong Kong for transshipment to Burma. In addition, the Glacier Line is planning to sail directly to Yangon and is being represented by Tongyi and Hongyun Shipping Companies. It is currently being planned and is scheduled to sail on Thursday of this week.

Visa Procedures

Anyone wishing to go to Yangon and enter the southwest and northwest regions via the Burma Road must complete passport procedures to avoid conflicting with local regulations and being refused landing. The Passport Visa Office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong has issued a notice to prevent the above from happening: "Any Chinese citizen wishing to go to British territories can obtain a passport from the office and complete all procedures. The office can provide guidance on the details. Those in Shanghai who wish to go to Yangon to obtain a passport can inquire at the China Travel Service and then obtain it from the Passport Visa Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong."

Prohibition of Carrying British Banknotes

Since the British government ordered a ban on the import of British banknotes into the country, the Governor of Burma has ordered a ban on anyone from any other country except India from carrying Bank of England banknotes into Burma, except with the permission of the Reserve Bank of India. Ordinary travelers are limited to carrying £10 of Bank of England banknotes into the country. Passengers from Shanghai to Yangon, Burma, should be careful not to carry more than £10 of British banknotes to avoid being seized and confiscated by the Yangon authorities. These Bank of England banknotes are the British gold tickets in the Shanghai market.

### Japanese Naval Officer - Visits Chairman of Shanghai Municipal Council

Yesterday (21st), Vice Admiral Iwamura Seiichi, the Japanese naval attaché stationed in Shanghai, accompanied by his successor, Rear Admiral Kanazawa Masao, visited the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Volunteer Corps dispatched honor guards to pay their respects.

### Japanese Warships Obstruct Shipping - Investigation of the Bombing of Shipu - More Than 900 Houses Destroyed - More Than 10 People Killed or Injured

At 9:30 AM on the 16th of this month, three Japanese warships anchored outside Shipukou suddenly fired 18 shells at the coast. One shell landed on Shipu Jiao San Wine Shop, destroying one house. Seventeen shells landed in front of Yanchang, destroying four civilian houses. There were no other losses. At around 10:00 AM, four Japanese planes attacked from the southeast, invading the airspace over Shipu City, flying low and circling.

Rotating Bombing

They dropped two incendiary bombs and two explosive bombs at the Old Daotou, Jiangqin Temple, and Nan Guan Bridge areas outside the city. One incendiary bomb and one explosive bomb were dropped in the Dandang Lane area in the city center. One explosive bomb landed at the foot of Tiger Cave Mountain, injuring one civilian. One bomb was dropped in the Great Church Ground, but no one was injured and there was no damage. The planes indiscriminately strafed the ground with machine guns for fifteen minutes before fleeing to the northeast. At that time, black smoke gathered over Shipu,

Stretching Straight

Into the clouds, the situation was terrifying. Because the shops and residents there could not withstand the shelling, they moved to the countryside on their own, leaving only a few poor, old, weak, and infirm people. As a result, there were few people to put out the fire, and it was left to burn itself out. It was not extinguished until 4:00 PM, and a total of more than 930 houses were burned down, with losses reaching 300,000 yuan. Eleven women and children and six men were burned to death.

Scorched and Battered

Some only had half a body left, and their intestines were broken and bleeding. The scene was unbearable to witness. Five men and two women were injured, but their lives were not in danger. After Shipu was bombed this time, there was no one left in the urban area. Only thin stray dogs were wandering around among the rubble and in the streets and alleys, searching for food. The scene was extremely desolate. Also, at 9:10 AM on the 15th of this month, the Ningbo air defense watch post reported that four Japanese seaborne bombers were attempting to

Invade Shipu.

The air raid emergency alarm was sounded. Ten minutes later, two planes circled over Shipu for a long time, spying. Afterwards, they escaped towards Linhai. Two other planes circled for a week and dropped four bombs on Dongmen Island, destroying three houses and one thatched shed. After dropping the bombs, the planes escaped towards Longshan out to sea.

### Crimes Greatly Reduced After Strict Security Measures in French Concession - No Assassination Cases in September - Other Robberies and Thefts Similarly Reduced - A Rare Phenomenon in French Concession Police Records

Since the French Concession implemented strict security measures and constant searches on all roads at the boundary points from September 1, the criminal activities that were common in August were greatly reduced in September. According to the investigation, (1) there were 14 assassination cases in the quarter, including 4 in July, 10 in August, and none in September; (2) there were 5 attempted murder cases, including 2 in July, 3 in August, and none in September. There were no such cases in one month, which is unprecedented in the police records of the French Concession. According to the average calculation for the past ten years, there have been four murder cases in the Concession per month; (3) Regarding armed robbery cases, there were a total of 44 cases in the quarter, including 17 in July, 16 in August, and 11 in September; (4) There were 7 attempted robbery cases, including 1 in July, 3 in August, and 3 in September. A total of 34 robbers were captured, and 4 pistols were seized. In recent years, there has been an average of 18 robbery cases per month; (5) As for burglary cases, they have been reduced to 71, including 19 in July, 31 in August, and 21 in September. A total of 14 people were arrested; (6) There were 61 theft cases (152 in the first quarter, 105 in the second quarter), and 26 people were arrested.

### Watching "West Front Film" - Impression of History and Tribulations

Mr. Ke De, Information Specialist of the German Embassy in China, hosted the press at the German School on Daxilu at 3:30 PM yesterday and screened a film on the Western Front. Mr. Ke stood up and made a speech, saying that he had missed everyone very much since he last saw them. He was very happy to be reunited in one room. Today, he is screening a film showing the German army's operations in various countries on the Western Front for everyone to enjoy. As for the content, everyone will understand it after watching it, and he doesn't need to waste words. The films screened this time are also accompanied by simple Chinese explanations, and he asks for everyone's instructions to achieve perfection. After he finished speaking, the lights were turned off, and Germany's "blitzkrieg," which shocked the world, began to be shown on the screen.

This so-called "West Front Film" has richer materials than those previously screened by the German Embassy. Although it is also a newsreel, it has become a complete story on the whole after editing. The main material is the German army's invasion of Holland, Belgium, and France, interspersed with the Norwegian defense war, Italy's declaration of war against Britain, and naval battles in the North Sea. It can be shown for two hours from the German army's capture of the Dutch port of Rotterdam to the French army's surrender and signing of the armistice terms with the Germans in the Forest of Compiègne. The time included in the battles shown in the film was exactly one month and nine days from May 11, when the German army began to attack Rotterdam with paratroopers, to June 20, when the French and Germans signed the peace treaty.

The German army's invasion of Western Europe first used the Fifth Column to sway people's hearts and serve as a hidden line for internal support. Then, paratroopers were dropped from the air to break into the enemy's rear, followed by artillery bombardment, aerial bombing, and finally mechanized units to protect the infantry charge. Those who stood in their way were crushed, and the capture of cities was a matter of moments. Therefore, when it was shown on the screen, except for the activities of the Fifth Column, which were not shown, the other formulas of the "blitzkrieg" were generally the same. The first shot of the "West Front Film" was of a group of planes rising from the runway at an airfield, the sound of creaking reverberating from the screen. In an instant, paratroopers descended, their huge parachutes slowly descending from the sky. After landing, each soldier formed a small team and began to attack behind enemy lines. Then, giant cannons roared, planes bombed, and infantry followed the mechanized units, swarming in. The Rotterdam garrison appeared on the screen, waving a white flag to surrender.

The German army's invasion of Leuven, attack on Dunkirk, and entry into Paris are all highlights of the "West Front Film." The scene of their entry into Paris was magnificent. General von Brauchitsch, the German commander, reviewed the German troops coming from the Champs-Élysées on the Avenue Foch. The picture had the Arc de Triomphe as the background and was a proud work of the German photographer. Another shot was of the awarding of medals in front of the Arc de Triomphe and the "eternal flame" in front of the graves of the war dead in the European War. The flame was burning brightly, and the tongue of fire was leaping, with no change. The brave soldiers sleeping in this tomb did not know that the German army's iron hooves had already arrived in their homeland. It was also a tragedy.

After the lively scene of the meeting between the German and French heads of state in Munich, this film came to an end. The ending was a tragic scene in the Forest of Compiègne. (See the European War Talk in this newspaper, No. 10.) First, when Hitler heard the news in the army that Pétain had expressed his desire for an armistice and peace, his state of complacency was such that he could not help but dance with his hands and feet. The film showed Hitler suddenly stretching out both arms and then raising his right foot to make a very light and quick turn. Also, when he was walking with General Göring in the forest, the leisurely and intimate feelings were vividly displayed on the screen. In this film of killing and terrible war, it is rare to get these two relaxing scenes! In front of the Compiègne Forest Square, there was a dining car parked. Hitler and General Keitel and others got into the car for a long time, and the French representatives also came slowly. Then, Hitler got out of the car first, the music played loudly, and he drove back to Germany with the glory of his victory. On the other hand, the French representatives got out of the car and walked into a small tent next to the square, accompanied by a German officer. After the four French representatives entered the tent, the German officer pulled the curtain up, and the audience lost sight of the four representatives. In fact, they were consulting with the Vichy side by telephone about the armistice terms granted by the German side. Their pain can be imagined. The German officer's small action of pulling the "curtain" cannot but make people sigh!

At 6:15, the whole film was finished, and the whole room regained its light. The visitors were happy, because the tense atmosphere of two hours was finally relieved.

### Bloodshed Repeatedly Occurs in Controlled Areas, Japanese Side Implements Strict Searches, Severity and Tediousness Unprecedented, Yu Yuan Road Northern District Just Recently Opened, Southern District Searched Yesterday, Many Residents Alarmed

The "North-China Daily News" reports that a Japanese military policeman was stabbed to death on the side of Yu Yuan Road last Friday. The Japanese military authorities immediately imposed a blockade on the area, isolating the area north of Yu Yuan Road from the outside world for a full twenty-four hours. The blockade was lifted at 5:30 PM last night (the 20th), and the unrest and anxiety of the residents in the area also came to an end.

Food Supplies All Interrupted

During this 24-hour blockade, the food and other supplies for Chinese residents in Lane 668 and Lane 608 of Yu Yuan Road, which lead to the location where the Japanese military policeman was stabbed, were all interrupted. The delivery of milk, bread, and newspapers to a few foreigners was also prevented. Prior to this, the aforementioned two lanes had been guarded by "city police" since Friday.

Chinese Inside Lanes All Prohibited from Passing

On Saturday night, several teams of Japanese military police arrived. Without warning, they erected barbed wire barriers at the entrances, obstructing pedestrian traffic. This continued until last night. Japanese soldiers did not interfere with foreigners, except for one instance where a sentry seemed to misunderstand his orders and hindered a certain foreigner's movement. However, all Chinese were prohibited from passing.

Door-to-Door Flag Sales, Soaked Through

Initially, no search teams appeared in the area, so people did not understand the Japanese side's motives. It wasn't until nearly noon that a small team of Japanese soldiers and "city police" went door-to-door in the two lanes "selling" one Japanese flag and one Nanjing (puppet government) flag each, and forced residents to hang both flags prominently on their doors or roofs. Residents were already worried about not getting food until the assassin was captured. In the afternoon, they were forced to buy and hang flags. Coincidentally, it was drizzling, and the flags were soaked and drooping dejectedly. It is unknown whether the Japanese authorities lifted the blockade suddenly in the evening due to the rain or because they realized they could not capture the assassin. After dark, food and other supplies were brought in continuously.

Strict Searches, Unprecedented

Since the assassinations of Zhang Xiaolin and Japanese military police Sergeant Saito, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have been conducting systematic searches of pedestrians and vehicles in their controlled areas for the past week. The strictness is unprecedented in the past year. The measures recently adopted in the Hongkou area are particularly severe. Japanese naval landing force soldiers are stationed on the Feilun Road Bridge, searching pedestrians and vehicles to prevent the concealment of weapons, which has been going on for several days. Pedestrians arriving here line up in long queues, being searched one by one, and it takes a long time to get through.

Hongkou Traffic, Exceptionally Congested

Those traveling by car and rickshaw are also forced to get out and be searched. In the evening, Japanese civilians in plain clothes replace the Japanese naval landing force soldiers to continue the searches tirelessly. Public buses and passengers in the Hongkou area are also subjected to the same searches, resulting in exceptionally congested traffic. The searches began to ease only yesterday.

Believing the Assassin is Hiding in a Certain House

Also, the English "China Press" reports that according to the Japanese authorities, the Japanese side believes that three assassins who ambushed the Japanese military policeman escaped into Lane 608 of Yu Yuan Road and are hiding in a certain house. Therefore, they blockaded the lane from Friday night. It is estimated that there are 4,000 residents in the lane. After the assassination of the Japanese military policeman, the Japanese authorities conducted a large-scale search in the "badlands" area of Yu Yuan Road.

Southern District Search

Japanese soldiers and so-called "police officers" stationed at the iron gates in various places in the French Concession adjacent to the Southern District, such as Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao, Dongxinqiao, and Xinkaihe, have been conducting strict searches of pedestrians entering and leaving since 6:00 AM yesterday. Any citizen who did not carry a "citizen's certificate" was blocked outside the iron gate, not allowed to enter or exit. At one point, hundreds of people were blocked. Residents living in the Southern District who wanted to enter the concession through the iron gate were also blocked and turned back. Some who had recently moved into the Southern District did not have "citizen's certificates" and were panicked, unable to enter the concession. As for the reason for this sudden Japanese inspection, one theory is that it was to rigorously pursue the fugitive murderer after the assassination of Zhang Xiaolin, and another is that it was due to the assassination of a Japanese military officer in Western Shanghai.

### Bloodshed at the Da Zhonghua Hotel: Principal Culprit Shot Dead, Four Accomplices Detained Pending Investigation

In room 628 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, a shooting assassination occurred at 9:00 PM on July 16th of this year. Hou Nianyan and Xu Zhenhua in the room were both seriously injured and died. Fan Fayuan (manager of the Lihai Company at 107 Jiangxi Road) was wounded in the neck. The perpetrators all escaped. After investigation by Chinese detectives Zhou Kaiwen and Han Shoushan of the General Inspectorate, the suspects Feng Liheng, Cai Xiaozheng, Yu Yuechu, Dong Zhengnan, Wu Amo, Qiu Yongtang, Qiu Ahai, Sun Zilong, etc., were apprehended. According to

Cai's Confession

they indeed participated in the assassination of Hou Nianyan and others at that time. The three suspects Feng, Yu, and Dong also participated. As for the principal culprit, it was a person named Wei Yaosheng. As for why Wei wanted to assassinate Hou and others, he did not explicitly say beforehand, so it is unknown. However, according to the investigation by the Inspectorate, the occurrence of this assassination incident is closely related to the gambling dens in Western Shanghai. As for the principal culprit in this case, Wei Yaosheng, he was also shot and killed on Gordon Road 28 days after the murder (i.e., August 14th). Therefore,

the Cause of This Case

cannot be known in detail. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District.

A reporter visited Mr. Nie Bainian, director of the Qujiang District Office of the university, and received the following information: "The university has long intended to return to Guangdong. Since President Xu took office on July 1st, active preparations have been underway. The estimated cost of the relocation is about 600,000 yuan, which will be jointly borne by the Ministry of Education and the Guangdong Provincial Government. The location has also been repeatedly surveyed and selected. With both funding and location resolved, the deans of each college have also been determined, with only the Dean of the College of Law, Yang Kaijia, not yet arrived (currently replaced by Hu Tigan). Half of the route goes from Kunming to Vietnam, then to Hong Kong and Shaoguan, and the other half goes from Kunming, Guiyang, Liuzhou, Guilin, and Hengyang to here. Those traveling along the Liuzhou-Guilin line have received the greatest convenience from the commanders, provincial chairmen, and relevant military and political leaders along the way. Commander Zhang and Hua Yu gave great assistance to Commander Yu Qi in transportation. According to the university's statistics, there are a total of over 2,000 boxes of instruments, of which 500 boxes have arrived in Shaoguan, and hundreds of boxes are still en route. Half are still in Yunnan and have not been transported. We are currently stepping up transportation.

After the university moves back to Guangdong, it plans to add an attached high school department in the future to attract young students."

### Letter to the Editor

Mr. Editor, I am a basketball enthusiast and have never missed a game in this charity basketball challenge organized by the Orphanage. I have enjoyed watching the fierce competition between the players of each team and am very fortunate. Paramount has achieved a great record of six wins in six games, which is not unexpected. However, the strength of each team should not be underestimated. The game between Paramount and Guoguang Alumni was the most satisfying. Although Guoyou was a temporary organization formed in a hurry, with less than a week of training, their combat strategy was unique. This time, the old friends reunited and used their "five-man joint defense" skill, which was so strict that there was no gap to take advantage of. The score on the scoreboard was constantly changing, often within one or two points. The tension and excitement of the performance were even better than the past game between Hualian and Paramount. In the end, Guoyou lost by only one point, which was not their fault. It was a matter of luck. However, it rained heavily that night, and only a few hundred fans waded through the water to attend. There must be many people who did not get to enjoy it. I would like to suggest to you, Mr. Editor, that such a close game should be replayed on a regular basis. Even if the tickets are still sold for five or ten yuan, I believe there will be many enthusiastic people in Shanghai who will be happy to contribute. You, Mr. Editor, advocate sports and are kind and compassionate, which I admire very much. I hope you will make a call to action and promote its success, which will not only be a blessing for the fans, but also benefit thousands of orphans. With respect, Wang Wenchao, October 21st.

### Finance - Cash Not Used for Futures - "Haxia" Crushes Short Sellers - Half-Month Term Restores Futures - Trading Suspended Yesterday for This Reason

Since the margin market was suspended at 823, the Gold Exchange Employees organized a "Haxia" market to conduct trading in a certain bank. At that time, only 12 silver building groups, 5 gold shops, and more than 20 money exchange businesses participated in the transaction. Market price fluctuations often followed foreign exchange rate changes. However, recently, it has reversed the normal pattern, with foreign exchange rates trending loosely, while "Haxia" has diverged and frequently risen, forming a short squeeze trend in the past week. From the 14th to the 19th, short sellers were constantly squeezed and painfully closed their positions. There are three main reasons for this:

(1) Shanghai is full of idle funds that cannot be used. After the "May 2nd" turmoil, interest in hoarding goods and speculating in foreign stocks gradually waned, and hedging foreign exchange was also avoided due to the unpredictable situation in the Pacific. Therefore, most of them shifted their target and competed to purchase "Haxia", especially those in Hong Kong. At the same time, after the bank reduced interest rates, those who had wealth believed that it would be better to convert their legal currency into gold and store it in a safe deposit box rather than deposit it in the bank.

(2) Although the situation in the Pacific is unpredictable, the overall outlook is bearish, so there are many short sellers. In the past, if there were floating short or long positions that could not be closed, colleagues could negotiate a delay in delivery, but now, due to the large amounts involved, it is not possible to accommodate.

(3) Speculators have different opinions on the current situation, and each has their own view. Therefore, long positions with strength secretly colluded to raise prices and search for purchases in order to carry out the trick of manipulating the market. Therefore, they put great pressure on the short side, tightened the "Haxia" chips, and did not release them, so that after the market price rose sharply, they could come out at a high price. Therefore, when the market price reached 5,900 yuan on the 19th, the silver building group had real goods flowing out.

With Shanghai's limited "Haxia" chips, after endless purchases by various parties and the manipulation of long positions to squeeze shorts, the market price naturally soared and diverged from the foreign exchange rate. The market side decided on the 19th that all transactions up to the closing price on that day would be settled at the closing price of the U.S. dollar (5.84375), which was equal to 5,984 yuan (also written as 90 yuan or 89 yuan and 2 jiao), and all long and short positions would be closed together. This was a difference of 160 yuan higher than the closing price on the 19th, and the short side suffered a great loss at this price. Therefore, yesterday, a method was decided that whether real goods were received and delivered or settled at the closing price, all long and short positions would be closed at the closing price of 5,830 yuan on the afternoon of the 19th. Therefore, "Haxia" was not traded yesterday. At the same time, it was decided to open futures trading from today, with settlement every half month. If there is no delivery of goods upon expiration, the term can be extended by paying interest, which is to restore the previous margin market trading method. As for the margin, it is set at 401 yuan per bar, and it has been decided to open the market as usual today (12th). (Holy)

In the early morning, floating households inside and outside the industry blindly absorbed the market, seeing the squeeze in the gold market and the rise in cotton yarn. Some speculative customers engaged in "Haxia" and futures transactions turned to the rice market because of the settlement price suspension. As a result, the rice market suddenly showed a lively and prosperous atmosphere, and the price of each foreign rice was immediately raised by 0.5 yuan to 0.7 or 0.8 yuan with enthusiastic buying. However, the industry leaders and major households did not inquire, and those who asked were all speculative scalping transactions. Actual sales were still bleak. Those who profited took the opportunity to sell at a high price, so the market price rose, the selling atmosphere suddenly rose, and the market gradually fell back. By noon, it was close to the previous closing price. There were fewer ins and outs in the afternoon, and the market was unchanged. New transactions were not opened. The re-imported Yinghua Company original package No. 2 Saigon spot was opened at 74 yuan, and the road goods for delivery next month were 73.2 yuan. More than 100 tons were opened, and nearly 10,000 packages of spot rice were transacted.

Although the arrival of new japonica rice and Yaozhong wild rice was not prosperous, only a total of 1,000 packages arrived. However, due to the rain, the general guests were afraid of water stains. The new goods were not strong and rarely made progress. The owners had the same mentality and also sought to sell quickly, resulting in a difficult price. New japonica rice was down by 1 or 2 yuan. Kunshan goods opened at 73 yuan, and those around Minhang were only 70 yuan. The original package of high-quality goods was 76 or 77 yuan. As for guest species and wild rice, the owners still tried to hold the price because of the scarcity of goods, so they did not open the market. Du Yangjian was also down by a small amount. Qingjiao Du Jian original package opened at 69 yuan, and the price per load was 65 yuan. Taicang Yangjian original package was 69 yuan, and broken japonica rice was only 82 or 83 yuan for ordinary japonica rice. As for Nangang early broken rice, all were not opened.

(Zu)

Flour - Yesterday, No. 1 flour factory's list price was changed to 17 yuan, a sudden increase of 0.5 yuan. Since the price of re-imported goods has been expensive, each factory has been intending to raise the price due to the lack of raw materials and high costs. However, the authorities in the concession have restrained the price increase and maintained the nature of the street, so they have not immediately increased the price. Until yesterday, they started to increase the price by 0.5 yuan again. The re-imported goods market has gradually become peaceful last weekend. Now that the factory price has been increased, the situation will inevitably tighten again. It is heard that the old car brand price is 19.34 yuan, and the price of foreign flour is approaching the 20 yuan mark due to the lack of fixed orders. However, transactions have not yet started. The total market, in addition to the two factories selling more than 8,000 packages, other transactions are less than 5,000 packages.

However, colleagues and factories have been selling consistently, and the momentum is still outstanding. 20-count Double Horse has reached 1285 yuan.

Woolen Cloth - The trend is firm and stable, and sales are good in both retail and wholesale. Transactions for men's and women's colors and linings are quite prosperous. Due to traffic jams and the restriction of control, although the guests have tried to transport the goods, the number is small. Therefore, 70 to 80% are sold in this street. Looking at the current era of rising prices, woolen cloth is also following suit, but its purchasing power is gradually weakening. Therefore, the lower-grade goods are more popular. Woolen cloth with a price of more than 1 yuan per yard, regardless of thickness, is suitable for Chinese and Western clothing, and sales are booming.

Furthermore, foreign firms have already sold out their spot goods, so the market outlook is expected to rise steadily.

Factories producing galvanized iron, thermos bottles, toys, and biscuits are also being actively purchased yesterday, and there is limited circulating stock in the market, resulting in market inflation.

The grey market for securities saw further prosperity yesterday. Class C bonds traded above 60 yuan, and Class E bonds also reached a new high of 60 yuan. The market reached new highs across the board, marking the highest levels since August 13th. The momentum is unprecedented. This is because the gold market was unable to open yesterday due to issues, causing speculators to flock to the government bond market with substantial capital. Their efforts were further supported by a new loan of 50 million US dollars, creating a fleeting opportunity. Gatherings became crowded, buying interest surged, and the market was filled with bullish sentiment. In the afternoon, a certain bank sold 300,000 to 400,000 units, causing a slight setback at the peak. Some bulls took profits, but prices remained relatively high. The future may see a slight pullback before another push towards new highs. Yesterday morning, Zhenkang was the first to buy, followed by Renchang, Maotai, and Lemao. Hu Heji, Hengfu, and Lianyi also engaged in acquisition, but the large supply from Hongda and Yitai was ineffective. All bonds reached new highs. In the afternoon, Jiufeng, Lianyi, Tongkang, and Dasheng all vigorously bought, pushing Class C bonds above 60 yuan and Class E bonds to 60 yuan. Subsequently, Songmao, on behalf of a certain bank, sold 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of Class E bonds, increasing supply. Selling pressure from various parties gradually increased, and Hongda resumed selling. Datong, Tongshun, and Xinfu also sold, causing prices to fall by a small margin of 0.03 to 0.05 yuan, but closing prices mostly remained above the morning's closing prices. Ultimately, Class D bonds saw the largest increase, rising by 1.6 yuan, while the rest rose by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan each. The total transaction volume was approximately 2 million yuan.

Free Talk

### Editor's Note

— The Editor

Regarding the question of whether it is a sacrifice for women with higher education to return to their families, we have published several articles in the past. Recently, due to the publication of some timely articles, and because the submitted articles discussing women's issues were relatively crowded, and it took time to organize them, we have stopped publishing them several times. Now, the submitted articles have been organized, but because the "Free Talk" section is small, and it is not convenient to use the entire section to discuss women's paths, we can only select a portion of the articles more strictly to publish them successively. We will pay special attention to the opinions and personal experiences of women themselves.

Regarding the question of "Is it a sacrifice?", Mr. Chen Ming has submitted another article, "Revisiting Sacrifice," stating that his "original intention was not to advocate that all women should take the path of family." He "acknowledges that women should occupy the same position as men in society, but under the premise that the family system cannot be abolished or changed in the present (and near future), it should also be a career for a large part of women to voluntarily or passively return to their families to fulfill their responsibilities, and should not be regarded as a sacrifice." He also mentioned the unreliability of entrusting all housework to servants.

Regarding this point, Ms. Xu Jian feels that social service and managing a home can be balanced, and there are facts to prove it.

Ms. A Pin's "Living for Others" depicts the suffering of a woman in an old family, as well as her efforts after gaining freedom. Her valuable opinions are especially worth our attention.

Family

### Living for Others

— A Pin

I am not a graduate of a certain university or middle school, nor have I ever been active in society. I am just an unfortunate woman who was sent to a large family after only five years of primary school and was tightly bound by old etiquette for six years.

In a large family, especially one with some assets and feudal remnants, the oppression and suffering experienced by a daughter-in-law are indescribable. The stern faces of the parents-in-law, the infighting among sisters-in-law, the difficulties caused by the sisters-in-law, and the secret deception by servants, all caused immense suffering to a seventeen-year-old me. My body belonged to my parents-in-law, not to my husband. Other than secretly exchanging a few words at night, we were absolutely not allowed to talk at other times. Even if I encouraged my husband to seek knowledge or correct a mistake, labels like "afraid of his wife" and "henpecked" would be applied to both of us. Flattering the parents-in-law, sucking up to the sisters-in-law, and running errands for the sisters-in-law were my duties. I did not live for myself, not for my husband, and certainly not for my children. Day and night, I toiled for the parents-in-law, sisters-in-law, and sisters-in-law, always with a smiling face. A slight slip-up would result in the grave sin of "unfilial piety." Let alone social activities, even leaving the house was difficult. I simply lived mechanically and aimlessly for others!

With a loud bang, the artillery roared, the family property was destroyed, and the feudal large family could no longer bind me. My husband, children, and I quietly came to Shanghai amidst the raging fires and opened a small shop that barely provided a livelihood. Although we suffered from economic hardship, I was finally free.

The first priority after gaining freedom was to seek knowledge again. I knew that shallow knowledge could not adapt to future society. Although six years of confinement had turned me into a frail woman like Lin Daiyu, and the decline of the family fortune made financial resources tight, neither financial nor mental strength allowed me to seek more knowledge. However, I chose courses that suited my personality and studied diligently on my own, in preparation for future applications.

It is not just the aversion caused by six years of confinement in a large family that makes me disapprove of Hitler's style of confining women to their families. It is truly my heartfelt feeling that if we women adhere to old-fashioned ideals and bury ourselves in our families, we will never be able to adapt to modern trends. At the very least, after stability and the blood baptism, China needs a large number of citizens to take on the responsibility of nation-building. We are also part of the citizens, and we bear the same responsibility to our motherland. What should we, the female compatriots who make up half of the population, do to encourage ourselves during this time of national crisis? When society needs us, we can raise our arms and work hard to create a perfect country for our great China and open up a bright path for our women! To do work that is more important than comforting our husbands and raising our children!

Women

### Can Be Balanced

— Xu Jian

The organization of a family is not necessarily as simple as unmarried men and women imagine. Indeed, educating children and managing complex household affairs are burdens that women cannot put down in today's society, before nurseries and public canteens are established. As a wife and mother, it is certainly unacceptable to abandon the family and disregard the family in order to focus on work in society. However, to bury a woman's entire spirit solely for the sake of raising children and keeping the family tidy, believing that this is a woman's career, is also a bit too cruel! Under the cries of "gender equality" and "women's liberation," we fortunate few have been able to receive knowledge on the same footing as men and be nurtured and valued by society. Then, after "achieving academic success," we should contribute all our abilities in the same way as men, to repay the country and society. We can manage the household and educate our children on the one hand, but on the other hand, we must also go out into society to work.

Perhaps some people think I am dreaming, but hold on; the facts are the most reasonable witness. I myself grew up in such a family. My father held positions in education, journalism, and politics throughout his life and never retired, while my mother served in education for twenty years. Before marriage, she was a good teacher to her students, and she remained so after marriage. She did not abandon her responsibility to serve society because of her family. Although my father wanted her to resign because he was concerned about her overwork, she never neglected her duties. And our family did not become chaotic because of my mother's job. After setting certain rules for housework, it became a habit, and it was not difficult to manage. I also know many housewives who participate in social activities as much as possible while managing their households and raising their children. Their families are also well-organized. This makes me feel that managing a household and holding a job can be done simultaneously.

Therefore, I feel that a well-educated housewife, a modern woman, should have the ability to manage the household, educate children, serve society, and lead the masses, so that those who do not receive light can see the light again, and those who are ignorant can be educated. We must know how great and how needed is the power of the cooperative work of our female compatriots, who make up half of the country's population. May everyone work hard!

### "Easy on us, Sir!"

— Zhang Zhiqing

For hunger, for delaying for a moment our insignificant lives like ants, we thronged in front of the government rice store. The fire of hunger stirred us to jostle and struggle, and the strict order was disturbed. Sir! You are the maintainers of peace, and indeed, disturbance and commotion need your whips to correct them. But, Sir! Several days of hunger have already exhausted us. How can our emaciated muscles and withered bones endure the whip? Sir! Please accept our bold request: "Easy on us, Sir! When you wield your whips." (Unpaid)

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 9: Astonishing News

I originally intended to seize this opportunity to search a bit, in case Old Mao might have stolen jewelry. The stolen goods would certainly not have had time to leave, and might still be in this box. I squatted down and lifted the lid of the wicker trunk a little. The trunk was locked. I had a second thought. Opening this box would certainly not be difficult, but if I immediately broke into his box, it would be too unfounded. It would be better to discuss it with Hawthorne before acting. Therefore, I stood up straight and walked out of the gatehouse.

As I walked onto the cement path, I saw the sunlight shining fully on the flower bed on the left. The soil of the flower bed, after being washed by last night's rain, presented a smooth and even state, just like I had seen it in the morning. Several pale red and slender monthly roses, receiving the warmth of the sunlight, were more energetic than when I saw them in the morning, as if a melancholic and sickly beauty had received some comfort, forcing out a kind of reluctant bitter smile, but the end of its life was also right in front of it. I walked up the steps of the main house and saw that although the wooden board covering the footprints at the entrance had been moved away, the messy footprints had increased quite a bit, but the previous A-shaped footprint still refused to be completely blurred, showing that the floor had not yet been wiped. I walked to the door of the drawing room, turned the doorknob, and the door was locked. I had no choice but to stand and wait. Before long, Old Mao had led Jinmei downstairs. Jinmei nodded to me and used the key in her hand to open the door of the drawing room.

I said to Old Mao, "I need to talk to Jinmei for a few words. You go to the gatehouse."

I walked into the drawing room first, and after Jinmei followed in, I closed the door of the drawing room. The scene in the room was no different from when I came in this morning, except there was one less dead person. Although the light was not very dim, due to the closing of the windows and doors, the air was very dull, and there was still a feeling of sadness in my mind, so when I sat down on the leather cushion chair next to the round table, I felt very uncomfortable mentally. Jinmei also frowned tightly, and her expression was not as calm as when I first saw her.

I said, "Jinmei, you sit down too. The results of our investigation into this case from all aspects show that it is very tortuous. We already know that the person who caused this tortuous situation is you."

The maid looked at me and said in surprise, "Me? -- Me? What? I don't understand."

I replied, "In other words, what you told us this morning was completely insincere, and you hid important facts, which made this matter even more complicated." (43)

### God in the Whirlwind (1)

The ways and circumstances in which God speaks to people vary from time to time. Today's topic is to remind us of the past when God spoke to people in the whirlwind. (Job 38) The reason why the wind is called a whirlwind is because when this wind comes, it is in a spiral form, not only blowing fiercely, but also rotating in the air, small enough to make dust cover the sky, and large enough to have the power to uproot trees and shake mountains. In the history of nature, there are often records of whirlwinds causing harm. Wherever the whirlwind passes, all buildings and crops in the fields, as well as tall buildings and mansions, can be uprooted and destroyed without anything remaining.

The so-called God speaking to Job in the whirlwind is a metaphor, allowing us to infer Job's experience of the whirlwind. He indeed had this experience. He had seven sons, three daughters, seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred pairs of oxen, five hundred donkeys, and many male and female servants. He was an extremely wealthy man in the East. Who knew that in one day, while his children were at a banquet, a gale suddenly came from the wilderness, collapsing his house, and his children were all crushed to death. All his cattle, sheep, and camels were either robbed or suffered from plagues. He himself was covered in sores, unable to sit or lie down in peace, and in great pain. Wasn't this a sudden disaster, like a whirlwind? (Job 1:2)

The Book of Job also tells us that the reason why Job encountered this misfortune was because he was a completely upright man who feared God and shunned evil. (Job 1:1) The devil accused him before God, saying that his fear of God was completely hypocritical. Because his purpose was to obtain God's blessings of all his children and property. If everything he had was destroyed, he would surely change his mind and not fear God as he used to. In order to teach the people of the world and to prove Job's truthfulness, God allowed the devil to carry out the work of testing, causing his livestock to die, and his family property to be destroyed. Although Job suffered this great disaster, he still did not change his reverence for God. On the contrary, he said: "I came naked from my mother's womb, and I will also return naked. The one who gives is God, and the one who takes away is also God" (Job 1:21) (To be continued on the 27th)

Entertainment World

### First Look at "Confucius"

— Si Hua

The long-awaited Min Hua epic "Confucius" has been screened in Shanghai. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to appreciate it, and I am reporting on my impressions.

Confucius' lifelong achievements, such as his philosophical thoughts, political theories, and educational methods, are the main themes of this film: "Practicing benevolence and righteousness, correcting people's hearts." Selecting historical facts, the film begins with Qi attacking Lu. The depiction of the soldiers' brutal behavior accurately portrays the darkness of that time. After Confucius appears, he narrates the current environment and immediately asks his disciples Yan Hui, Zilu, etc., about their aspirations, which leads to his discourse on "practicing benevolence and righteousness, correcting people's hearts." Afterwards, the scenes of war and Confucius teaching his disciples are contrasted, leaving a deep impression.

Serving in Lu, the scene transitions from lecturing the disciples to speaking to the Duke of Lu in the court, but the speeches continue uninterrupted. Confucius' achievements in governing Lu are described from the perspective of the State of Qi, followed immediately by the meeting at Jiagu. The transition is consistent and without any sense of obstruction.

After the Duke of Lu accepts female musicians, Confucius decides to leave Lu. The disciples are willing to follow, and his daughter bids farewell, which are all very moving. Traveling around the states is represented by many long-distance shots and maps of various places. Situations such as being trapped in Wei and Chen Cai are depicted in several scenes, describing the difficult and precarious circumstances. And twice the scene of Confucius' daughter praying for her father's safety is inserted, further moving people with the emotion of filial piety. But Confucius disregards life and death and treats all of this with equanimity, which even transforms the strong and indignant Zilu, who begins to sing and dance along with Confucius' zither music. Confucius, at an old age, travels around for reasons not for profit, on the contrary, to save the common people from misery. This spirit of self-sacrifice is something everyone should learn.

Near the end of the film, the depiction of Confucius' later years is very poignant: his purpose of saving the world has not been achieved, and his favorite disciples Yan Hui and Zilu die one after another, leaving only one grandson by his side. The scene of Zilu's death in battle is handled very well, but the large number of soldiers attacking Zilu is not very realistic. After Confucius' death, the film ends with a song praising Confucius.

The overall layout and colors of the film are solemn, the dialogue is concise and insightful, the director's skills are superb, the shots are lively, and the visuals are beautiful. It is a pity that the photography in a few places is not very clear, but the sets are very satisfying. However, the sound effects in the large scenes are slightly inferior. In terms of actors, Tang Huaiqiu's Confucius expresses Confucius' noble and great personality very well. Zhang Yi's Zilu is heroic and strong, and can develop his personality quite well. Murong Wan'er is on the screen for the first time this time, playing Nanzi. There are not many scenes, and she has not been able to fully display her acting skills.

### Prelude to Li Wanchun's Arrival in Shanghai

— Xin Sheng

Among the martial actors, the one who enjoyed the earliest and greatest reputation, considering both the North and the South, is only Li Wanchun. Wanchun is the son of the martial actor Li Yongli. At the age of five or six, he was able to perform various long-costumed and short-fighting plays. Compared with the child actor Liu Tianhong, who was able to sing in color at the ancestral temple at the age of eight, it is truly miraculous. This is due to extraordinary intelligence, which cannot be forced by human power. I watched Wanchun's plays between 1923 and 1932, when Wanchun had already achieved considerable fame.

Famous Throughout the Nine Cities

Plays such as "Two Generals at Changbanpo" showed his skilled prowess, completely in the style of a master. His handsome appearance is just an aside. In the autumn of 1926, he went south with Mei Wanhua to perform at the Daxin Stage (now Tianchan). At that time, Wanchun was fifteen or sixteen years old, like a spring flower just blooming, outstanding and extraordinary, beautiful and elegant, beyond description. "Two Generals," "Lin Chong's Night Flight," "Evil Tiger Village," and "Linked Rings" were all praised by word of mouth. In the past, Xie Ju praised Liu Xia with the phrase "Heroes of the Jianghan, seen in this!" I say the same of Wanchun. In recent years, Wanchun has devoted himself to monkey plays. In addition to the existing "An Tian Hui" and "Water Curtain Cave," he has also newly arranged "The Complete Monkey King," "Skull Mountain Monkey King Strikes the Corpse Demon," and "Eighteen Arhats Capture the Great Peng" full-length plays, which are performed regularly in the ancient capital, and his popularity is unmatched. In addition, plays such as "Eight Copies of the Iron Rooster," "The First Two Copies of the Wine Beggar," "Cao Ying for Twelve Years," "The Complete Ma Chao," "Kang Xiao Ba," "Eight Great Captures," "The Complete Huang Tianba," and "True and False Ouyang De" are all Wanchun's proud and popular masterpieces. If he can perform as many of them as possible during this visit to Shanghai,

Unique Martial Plays

His resulting reputation will naturally be within our expectations. If he insists on showing off his breadth of repertoire, combining civil and martial plays, or presenting a mix of Yang and Ma styles, then I dare not hope for it. In short, Wanchun is a born martial artist of exceptional talent. Whether the martial plays he performs are long or short, he is more than capable of looking down on everything in the ranks of young martial actors. After Xiao Lou, the one who is full of vitality and has inexhaustible energy is only this one person. Actors have their own specialties in learning their craft. Performing civil plays requires civil actors with talent for civil plays. If one tries to learn both, the result will be like drawing a tiger. Even if one has a particularly high talent and seems to be able to do everything, the general rule of specializing rather than generalizing should be followed. At most, one will end up being a hodgepodge. Why bother? I have known Wanchun for a long time, and our friendship is also quite deep. When he comes, in addition to expressing a warm welcome, I dare to offer a word of foolishness. I hope Wanchun will accept it. If he can deeply understand this point and move forward, he will reap both fame and fortune, and enjoy it for a lifetime. Wanchun, strive for it!

### Stars Trapped in a Small Building

— Chou Cheng

Yuan Ludeng, nicknamed "Uncle Everybody," and Han Langen and Yin Xiucen, the Chinese Laurel and Hardy, sang Wang Laowu songs together in the radio station, and also took a photo together to commemorate the event. Yuan, wearing a long gown and jacket, stood in the middle with a serious expression. Han and Yin were bare-chested on the left and right, one as thin as a skeleton, the other as fat as a floating corpse; both had silly smiles, which were difficult to describe. Yesterday, the Guoguang Pharmacy opened, and they were invited to open the ceremony, and three movie stars, Li Lihua, Bai Hong, and Li Hong, were invited to cut the ribbon. Yuan, still wearing his gown and jacket, arrived the earliest and waited upstairs. After a while, he heard thunderous applause downstairs, knowing that the stars had arrived. Sure enough, Wang Dabang acted as a volunteer bodyguard, pushing his way through the crowd. Han shouted that he couldn't take it anymore, Yin was already panting like a cow, and the three female stars were even red-faced. At that time, Guizhou Road was crowded with people, making them afraid to go downstairs. So Yuan described in detail how Chen Yunshang had injured her foot while cutting the ribbon the other day, and Yin took the opportunity to ask Dr. Chen to examine his trachoma. Han said he was taking advantage, and the receptionist held four cigars and gave them to Yin. Yin didn't dare to keep them to himself, but handed them over to Han. Han put two cigars in Yin's suit pocket, and said he was decorating his appearance for him. As he was about to stuff the remaining two in his own pocket, Officer Hong suddenly came and said that his pocket was also empty and could hold cigarettes. Han then gave him one, and said that the street was crowded with people, did he pretend to be an ox when he came? These three people were used to performing together. More and more guests gathered, and Yin, being fat and afraid of heat, said that at this rate, he was afraid of suffering from heatstroke. Han said that all the medicines were ready, and if he suffered from heatstroke, he would not die, and everyone laughed. He then telegraphed to send police to disperse the idlers, and they went downstairs to cut the ribbon and then fled together.
