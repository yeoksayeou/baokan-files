US Newspapers Pay Attention to Both European and Asian Wars, Believing China Will Continue to Fight

Washington – The events in the Far East and the European war are both attracting attention in US newspapers today. Reports from Shanghai that the Axis powers are now putting pressure on Chongqing, hoping to persuade Chairman Chiang to make peace with Japan, have aroused considerable interest here. However, it is generally expected to be ineffective, as all indications here suggest that China will continue to fight to resist the Far Eastern representative of the Axis powers. Chinese Ambassador Hu Shih and renowned Chinese financial expert Soong Tzu-wen visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday, and although the content of their discussions has not been disclosed, there is reason to believe that the Chinese representatives have outlined China's needs to continue the war of resistance against Japan. Rumors that China has requested a loan totaling US$200 million have not been confirmed, but it is expected that China could obtain a loan of at least US$50 million. Some observers believe that Japan's recognition of the Wang regime will prompt the US to announce continued assistance to China. The statement made by Admiral Nomura in Tokyo regarding his appointment as Ambassador to the US has also aroused considerable interest here, but officials have not made any substantial criticism of the statement. Secretary of State Hull, when meeting with reporters yesterday, declined to directly criticize Nomura's remarks, only stating that everyone knows the US position, which is to advocate that international relations should be based on law. Some observers interpreted Hull's statement as implying that the US believes Japan's foreign policy often conflicts with this principle. The general feeling is that Nomura may be the most qualified ambassador Japan could send to Washington, but how Nomura can reconcile Japan's policy in China with his statement that all Eastern countries must have continued free and unrestricted relations with other countries is something that many want to see. People here generally feel that Japan's actions speak louder than its words. The Washington Post, in its commentary on the death of Saionji, said that Saionji spent his later years in Japan's tumultuous circumstances, seeing the new Japan he created revert to feudalism, and there was no other option but to die. The New York Times also wrote an editorial stating that Saionji's experience and wisdom had not been utilized by Japan recently, otherwise Saionji's death would have been a significant loss to Japan. Saionji had contributed to Japan's rise and originally wanted to dedicate his remaining years to contributing to the country he had created, but seeing the impetuous elements imitating Hitler and not allowing him to serve, he abandoned his desire to continue living.

### Citibank Hankou Branch Closes Yesterday; US Trade with China Sharply Declines

New York – Citibank's Hankou branch, which has been established for 38 years, closed today due to the sharp decline in US trade with China since the outbreak of the Far East war. According to bank personnel, there are no plans to close branches in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Tianjin, and Beiping. The Hankou branch previously played an active role in regulating finances for the export of Chinese goods such as tung oil, but recently Chinese goods have been stockpiled in the interior and are no longer being shipped out, for fear of falling into Japanese hands.

Tokyo – Since Japan accused Americans of aiding the Chongqing Nationalist government, the tense situation between the US and Japan has increased again. Today, Japanese newspapers issued a new warning to the US, stating that Japan has the "determination" to build a new order in the Far East. Tokyo newspapers predicted that Admiral Nomura's mission to the US would not be easy. The influential Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun stated, "If the US continues to refuse to recognize Japan's determination to establish a new order in East Asia, this difficult situation will not be resolved. The US may recall that Japan had strived to prevent the outbreak of both the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, but at the final moment, Japan bravely went ahead." (International Dispatch, 27th)

Hull Discusses US-Japan Relations, Saying Only Replacing Ambassadors Will Not Help

Washington – Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that if Japan wants to improve relations with the US, it must fundamentally change its policies. Simply replacing the Ambassador to the US will not help. Hull reiterated US policy, stating that the US only recognizes the peaceful resolution of international issues and opposes warlike actions, as belligerents are currently doing. The Secretary of State also stated that he and other Americans share the same opinion, having spent years promoting a process to improve international relations through law and order. Hull said that Mr. Nomura has a good reputation on the international stage. Many neutral observers believe that Hull's statement was a welcome to Nomura, but at the same time, it implied to Japan that US policy is firm and cannot be resolved simply by replacing the ambassador. According to officials, the main points of the US process mentioned by Hull are no more than the following eight: (1) Peace, (2) Legality, (3) Fairness, (4) Compliance with treaties, (5) Non-interference in others, (6) Peaceful resolution of international disputes, (7) Fair trade, (8) International cooperation. Hull had stated this doctrine before President Roosevelt was re-elected and called it the fundamental policy of US diplomacy. Hull stated, "Our doctrine has won the friendship of various countries, but not of certain countries because they, under the slogan of 'having nothing', claim to have the right to invade other countries with huge navies and armies." (Associated Press Dispatch, 27th)

The article concludes by stating that the US's basic policy in the Far East is to prevent Japan from becoming the dominant power in the Pacific. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)

Editorial

### The Internal Situation of Japan Amidst the Southern Advance

Although Japan's diplomacy has, in fact, reached a dead end recently, observing its general trends, it still attempts to maintain its offensive externally. Whether it is various military deployments or diplomatic attempts regardless of success or failure, it is actively engaged in them, especially emphasizing the path of southern advance. This newspaper has continuously reviewed it for several days. Before it embarks on such a new major adventure, whether its internal situation has improved and whether all configurations have been completed are major issues. Recently, Kinoshita once stated: "In the near future, a new crisis that will determine the fate of the country for a hundred years will arrive." It can be seen that he not only had a premonition about the current situation but was also quite vigilant. But the problem here is not whether there is awareness but whether there are countermeasures. Now that the elder statesman has newly passed away, there is no one behind the scenes to secretly direct and guide the fate of Japan, and everything depends on the abilities of Konoe and his subordinates. Looking at Japanese history, perhaps the current situation is the most difficult. Before the Meiji Restoration, there were external shackles of unequal treaties and internal overbearing and separatist Bakufu, which were roughly similar to the current situation, but they represented two different eras of new life and decline. In particular, most of the problems at that time came from the outside, while at this moment, all the difficulties are mostly due to itself. If it does not indulge in ambition, does not engage in reckless militarism, and does not regard neighboring countries as its territories and the great powers as deceivable, then the current international community should not hinder Japan's normal development. Among the Japanese, not everyone is unaware of this meaning, but on the one hand, they are intimidated by the power of the military, and on the other hand, they are obstructed by the adverse currents of the international situation, so they can only lurk weakly. Now that Saionji, who represents Japanese liberalism and constitutional government, has passed away, it is expected that this view, unless there are special changes in the internal and external situation, will hardly be able to raise its head for a while. The Japanese authorities headed by Konoe appear to be no different from radical right-wing elements in appearance, but in reality, they are middle-of-the-roaders between extremists and conservative camps. On the one hand, they call for a new political system, but they are still infatuated with the so-called established forces. In their hearts, they imagine that they can control the military, but in action, all their measures resonate with the military. Therefore, radicals criticize them for not being thorough, while conservative camps oppose their reforms. Some people even accuse Konoe's new government of communist suspicions, which requires repeated clarification. Looking at the recent statements of the Kokumin Shimbun, there is hardly anything that does not make things difficult for Konoe and Matsuoka. Right-wing soldiers and the so-called Japanese nationalist factions are particularly opposed to Konoe, and industries and capitalists have also adopted an uncooperative attitude towards Konoe's new government recently. In the early autumn when Konoe came to power, he originally called for the elimination of mutual erosion, but now the effect of unification has not been seen, and Konoe's own faction has become the target of public criticism. Then, even if he has wise understanding and great ambitions, at such a critical moment, it is difficult to imagine how he can make effective use of them, not to mention that fundamentally, he and the blindly radical elements in Japan are only different in degree.

Since Konoe's New Order Movement transformed into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, its importance and appeal have been greatly diluted. Konoe himself lacks the necessary ambition and does not have a mass base. As a result, the movement he calls for can only be built on the equilibrium of various established forces, forcibly making liberals, totalitarians, and even extreme right-wing Japanese nationalists jointly shoulder the guiding center. In the view of Konoe, Arima, and others, it is to "integrate and consolidate the established forces, subjecting them to an elimination process to suit the needs of national mobilization." However, this process is not something that can be achieved overnight. It must go through a long period of time and proper management to take effect, and it is possible that new disputes may arise due to "mutual erosion." But Konoe placed his ideals on such a complex collective and expected it to play the role of supporting the imminent external adventure, which is truly a mysterious ideal!

The goal of the southern advance is to seize new markets and resources, but the fact is that it is not readily available. Therefore, in the process of its implementation, it must pay a heavy price and find other ways to offset the economic pressure from Britain and the United States. For this need, the Japanese authorities have indeed put in great effort to plan in the economic field. As early as this spring, Japan adopted a policy of diversifying trade, seeking markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America to replace the previous "dependence on Britain and the United States." After the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, it advocated economic cooperation with Germany, Italy, and even the Soviet Union. On the second of this month, it passed the Sino-Japanese "Manchukuo" Ten-Year Economic Construction Plan to intensify the exploitation of resources on the Asian continent. In addition, the national economic reorganization movement included in Konoe's new political system is embarking on a comprehensive control of Japanese industry, starting in October with the most difficult reorganization of small and medium-sized enterprises. All of this is to break through the current economic difficulties to support its large-scale military needs, which is to achieve the establishment of a so-called highly national defense economy. However, these methods either yield weak results and do not contribute to the overall situation, or they are applied too slowly to be effective in the short term. If the southern advance results in actual action, the huge war expenses and consumption of materials will immediately form a serious problem. Konoe's economic path, like his political path, clearly lacks effective solutions.

A swift success in the southern advance would naturally be enough to significantly eliminate various internal difficulties in Japan. But the problem now is that, except for a part of Vietnam, Japan's attempts will inevitably encounter major obstacles, and the part of Vietnam is clearly not enough to satisfy Japan's desires. Leaving aside military conditions, judging solely from Japan's internal economy and politics, it can be asserted that Konoe's efforts have failed to make the entire machinery of the Japanese empire suitable for large-scale adventures.

(Editor's Note: Yesterday, a New York source intercepted a German radio broadcast stating that the partial demobilization of Bulgarian troops "proves that the tensions between Bulgaria and Turkey have eased, and the tensions between Germany and Turkey have also eased as a result."

### Bulgaria Refuses to Join, Causing Great Disappointment to the Axis Powers

London: The Axis powers' plan to enlist various small European countries into the Axis front has suddenly come to an unexpected halt. This is likely due to the setbacks suffered by Italy's attempt to invade Greece. The trend of various small countries leaning towards Berlin has suddenly ceased, and the German side also claims that its diplomatic activities have come to an end. It is expected that no other countries will join the Tripartite Pact in the short term. People in Berlin were extremely surprised by this news, as the German side had indicated that Bulgaria would sign the agreement by Wednesday of this week. It was not until yesterday that reports emerged that Bulgaria would postpone the signing, and now there are reports that Bulgaria may not sign and join the Axis after all. (27th Reuters Dispatch)

London: News from Berlin and Rome both indicate that the Axis powers are gradually losing faith that Bulgaria will welcome the "New Order" and are comforting themselves with the addition of Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia to the Tripartite Pact. Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov and Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer's joint visit to Berlin, in terms of actual and obvious results, was equivalent to not having taken place at all. The German propaganda machine is no longer mentioning this. Several commercial experts accompanied Molotov to Berlin, and at the time there was a sense that Soviet-German commercial relations were about to expand, but to this day, this sense has not materialized. Bulgaria's attitude seems to be swayed by the fate of Romania and the actions of Greece. Greece has inflicted the most severe blow on Italy that the Axis powers have ever encountered. This incident is a timely factor for Bulgaria to decline to lean towards the Axis. In addition, Turkey, a strong neighbor of Bulgaria, has adopted a stance that also prevents Bulgaria from easily taking risky gambles. (27th Reuters Dispatch)

### Britain Is Willing to Help Bulgaria Maintain Its Independence and Integrity, British Foreign Secretary Offers Promise in the House of Commons on the Condition That Bulgaria Does Not Assist the Axis

London: Yesterday, it was pointed out that if Bulgaria does not directly or indirectly provide assistance to the Axis powers, then Britain will do its best to help Bulgaria after the war. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler told the House of Commons that Foreign Secretary Halifax had provided assurance that if Bulgaria does not join the Axis or does not actively or passively assist the Axis, Britain "will do its utmost to ensure a final peace settlement for Bulgaria's independence and integrity." (27th Associated Press Dispatch)

Sofia: People here have recently acknowledged that Britain's statement that if Bulgaria does not join the Axis, Britain will guarantee Bulgaria's integrity after victory is a wise move by Britain. This declaration by Britain is purely a counter to the Axis powers' claim that Britain will divide Bulgaria after victory. Political figures also believe that this official statement by Britain will further encourage King Boris of Bulgaria to adhere to his refusal to participate in the war. Another part of the Bulgarian people say that Britain may not necessarily be able to maintain the status quo of this country, which is resisting the state of affairs after the last world war. (27th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Bulgaria Is Willing to Maintain Good Neighborly Relations with Neighboring Countries

Sofia: A disturbance occurred in the parliament today when a member, Mr. Tumanhov, launched a scathing attack on Yugoslavia. However, the matter was quelled after several prominent members (including former Prime Minister Giosievalov and Stankov) expressed their strong opposition. Mr. Giosievalov expressed regret for the attack at this time, saying that "we are currently working for peace in the Balkans. The Bulgarian people only seek to achieve their demands by peaceful means and to maintain good relations with neighboring countries. Moreover, the nature of our demands is extremely moderate. Every Bulgarian's heart dreams of an outlet to the Aegean Sea and the Thermaic Gulf, because they are important for our economic development and prosperity." Mr. Stankov said that Mr. Tumanhov's attack was merely an expression of his personal opinion and did not represent the government, parliament, or public opinion. (27th Reuters Dispatch)

Bulgarian Policy Leans Towards Socialism

Sofia: Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Shankoev said in a speech to parliament yesterday that in the current war between the Axis powers and Britain, Bulgaria is standing on the side of the Axis powers. Now there is a conflict between two major ideologies. Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union represent socialism, while Britain and the United States represent capitalism. Bulgaria belongs to socialism, and the purpose of its policy is to cooperate with a country that can guarantee its future independence. (27th Haitong Dispatch)

Bulgarian War Minister Asks Parliament for Increased National Defense Spending

Sofia: War Minister General Daskalov recently submitted a national defense bill to parliament, requiring approximately £4 million for supplementary expenses.

Steinhardt in Bulgaria: Soviet Statement Denies

Moscow: Soviet radio and newspapers have widely reported that the news spread by the Axis powers that Bulgarian politicians would not be invited to Berlin is false. Regarding the rumor (not reported by Reuters) that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt made comments after seeing King Boris of Bulgaria, it is considered absolutely untrue here, because Steinhardt has never been to Bulgaria in his life. Since returning here from the United States via the Siberian Railway on September 15th, he has not left Moscow. (27th Reuters Dispatch)

### Bulgarian Envoy to Germany Returns Home

Sofia: Bulgarian envoy to Germany, Mr. Bendrakianov, arrived here yesterday. The purpose of his return is still unknown. (27th Haitong Dispatch)

London: A spokesman for the Belgian embassy in London declared yesterday that the unoccupied areas of Belgium have now entered a state of "hostility" with Italy. The spokesman said that the declaration of this state of hostility was due to several hostile acts, including the establishment of air force bases within Belgium. The spokesman emphasized that there was no declaration of war, but relations with Italy would henceforth create a situation of "mutual retaliation and uncompromisingness." Italian "suspects" in the Belgian Congo have been arrested, but the spokesman did not elaborate. (27th Associated Press Dispatch)

Berlin: The official German News Agency (DNB) recently received news from Bucharest that sixty-four former Romanian political leaders, including one former Prime Minister and several cabinet members, military officers, and police chiefs, were taken from the Jilava military prison by the Iron Guard and executed by firing squad at 1:30 PM today.

### Greek Troops Advance in Rain and Snow, Fierce Battles Occur Along the Albanian Coast, Both Sides Vie for the Crucial Town of Telvino, Italian Land and Air Forces Reinforce to Reverse the Decline

Athens – On the line between Durrës and Vlorë, Greek troops have broken through and reached the Adriatic coast. Meanwhile, Italian forces, strengthened in the southwest, are under orders to defend their positions at any cost, but are isolated due to the Greek advance. Greek troops have made a large-scale breakthrough on the Albanian front today, with the potential to advance to the Adriatic coast. According to recent front-line reports, although Italian reinforcements have included over 30,000 soldiers and dozens of aircraft, Greek troops are progressing rapidly in the lowlands and highlands amidst rain and snow. Italian resistance is only very intense in the extreme southwest between Agioi Saranda and Himarë, as the strengthened Italian forces there have been ordered to defend at any cost. However, according to Greek reports, these Italian forces are also isolated because of the swift Greek advance westward from Moscopole. Recently, an elite Italian unit from Rome joined the battle but was quickly defeated by the Greek troops. The aim of the Greek troops is to isolate the Italian forces rather than to quickly invade Albanian territory. The report states that Greek troops have sent several columns deep into Albanian territory and then attacked the coastal areas or rugged mountain paths, thus encircling the Italian forces. It is said that the Greeks have conducted two encirclements, capturing thousands of Italian soldiers and countless supplies each time. (27th International News Agency)

Athens – According to reports, a most intense battle erupted yesterday around the town of Telvino, a crucial intersection on the Italian supply route from Sarandë to Gjirokastër in Albania. Sarandë is one of the main seaports for supplying Italian troops in Albania. The Italian forces seem prepared to make a final stand in Gjirokastër, but if the Greek troops manage to cut off the Italian supply line at Telvino, the main Italian force will be isolated. Military sources say the Greek authorities have conscripted 3,000 farmers to transport the military supplies abandoned by Italian troops in Moscopole, Greece. After a four-hour rest, Greek troops immediately pursued westward. In the battle for Telvino, Greek troops are using infantry as the vanguard, while the Italian forces are using light, fast tanks for defense. Both sides report that the fighting there is the fiercest yet. (27th Associated Press)

Struga, Yugoslavia – A telegram from the 27th reports that Italian forces trapped in a desperate situation are being fiercely attacked from all sides by Greek warriors and British-Greek aircraft. There will soon be a new commander-in-chief. The Governor of Albania has requested Mussolini to replace the newly appointed commander of the Italian invasion of Greece, General Soddu (who also serves as Undersecretary of the Army). His replacement will be General Guzzoni. The perilous situation of the Italian forces is worsening with each passing day, with major battles in three locations, the most intense being at Telvino. (27th Associated Press)

Badoglio Goes to the Front Lines, Giving Instructions to Italian Generals in Person

Elite Italian Troops Reinforce in Large Numbers, Air Force Venting Frustration with Indiscriminate Bombing

Athens – Well-informed military authorities have recently stated that General Soddu, commander of the Italian forces in Greece, seems to have halted the retreat of Italian troops in some areas, as a large number of elite Italian troops have been reinforced from the coastal area of Agioi Saranda to Lake Ohrid. Assisting these reinforcements are heavy Italian bombers, flying very high and blindly dropping bombs on areas where Greek troops are advancing. Italian military police are executing Italian soldiers who are deserting, hoping to deter others. However, even if the Greek troops are not effectively stopped, their advance into Albania will likely be prolonged. Large numbers of Italian aircraft are constantly flying over the 150-mile front, frequently bombing villages, bridges, and mountain paths in an attempt to cut off Greek communications and impede their advance. Yesterday, when Italian bombers, closely protected by large squadrons of fighters, flew to extreme altitudes over snow-capped mountains and indiscriminately dropped high-explosive bombs into the valleys, almost every town sounded an alarm and was bombed. Troops, farmers, Italian prisoners, and monks have all become victims of the air raids. In some areas, as many as 300 aircraft were hovering over the Greek lines, as British and Greek fighters also mingled with the Italian aircraft to destroy Italian bombers. (27th Associated Press)

Rome – This afternoon, the Italian military report stated that, in addition to reconnaissance along the Greek border, Italian aircraft continued to bomb enemy troops and their key positions, such as the military strongholds of Ersekë and Konitsa, as well as bridges over the Kalamas River and new artillery positions on the heights of Korytsiani. After completing their missions, the Italian aircraft safely returned to their bases. (27th Huitong News Agency)

Milan – The "Corriere della Sera" reports that Italian aircraft recently bombed the fortified Greek islands for five hours. The islands burned throughout the day, and the fires could be seen from afar. (27th Huitong News Agency)

A Unit of Greek Troops Lands Across the Sea, Disrupting Italian Transportation

Athens – Confirmed reports state that a unit of Greek volunteers crossed the sea yesterday and landed south of the port of Sarandë at Butrint (in Albanian territory), destroying bridges and highways there.

London – Yesterday, military sources here reported that Greek troops landed near the islands of Corfu and cut off the Italian forces' transportation route at Guallanada, at the foot of the mountains in the Agioi Saranda area of western Greece. (27th Associated Press)

Rome – An official Italian war communiqué stated that a unit of Greek marines, coming from the islands of Corfu, attempted to land near the port of Sarandë but was repulsed by Italian troops. Hand-to-hand combat occurred on the beach. This communiqué is the first Italian victory announcement since the Italian withdrawal from Korçë. (27th Associated Press)

One Month of Italian Operations Against Greece, The 18th Division Nearly Halved

Budapest – A Greek radio broadcast received here reports that in the one month of the Italian-Greek war, two Italian divisions have been completely annihilated, and five more have been routed. This great Greek endeavor has resulted in the Italian 18th Division, sent to Albania, being nearly halved. The efforts of the new Italian command to rebuild the Italian army have been thwarted by their rash retreat, and the bombing by British-Greek aircraft and the pursuit by Greek mechanized units, as well as the reckless attacks launched by the Greek forces using captured Italian tanks, have also contributed to the defeat of the Italian forces in this effort. The frequent bombing of Durrës and Elbasan by the British-Greek air forces has prevented the Italian forces from reinforcing their trapped troops via the main roads. At present, all Greek fronts are reporting success. (27th Associated Press)

### German Aircraft Swarms Cross the Channel at Night, Fiercely Attacking Western England, Southampton Bombed for the First Time, British Claim Several German Aircraft Shot Down

London – The German Air Force bombed western England throughout the night, until dawn today, when all of England was finally free from attack, as the adverse weather was not conducive to German bombers flying into British airspace. Last night, German bombers raided a certain city in western England for some time, with German aircraft entering every few minutes. London was also bombed last night, with some bombs falling within the city, causing damage to people and property. Before midnight, the air raid alert in London was finally lifted. At the same time, it was revealed this morning that Southampton was heavily bombed by German aircraft for the first time. The damage was so severe that residents in some parts of the city were forced to evacuate, unable to return. A British Air Ministry communiqué stated, "Thousands of incendiary bombs rained down on Southampton." Today, British officials also acknowledged that since Coventry was bombed, other cities such as Birmingham and Bristol have also been subjected to similar heavy bombing. (27th International News Agency)

London – On Tuesday, most of the few enemy aircraft that flew over southern and southeastern England during the day were shot down in a matter of moments. This is further evidence of the strength of British coastal defenses. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that two enemy bombers and fighter-bombers were destroyed. British aircraft suffered no losses in the fighting. Bombs fell on a certain town along the Sussex coast, damaging houses and causing minor injuries to several people. The enemy aircraft that attacked on Monday night appeared to concentrate their attacks on cities in the central part of England, with single aircraft flying in continuously for several hours, dropping flares, incendiary bombs, and high-explosive bombs. Two churches, one hospital, one theater, and one cinema, as well as several shops, were damaged. It is reported that three enemy aircraft were shot down southwest of London. (27th Reuters)

### British Ship Losses Since June Average 60,000 Tons Per Week

London – Shipping Minister Cross stated in a broadcast yesterday that British ship losses since June have averaged 60,000 tons per week, compared to 20,000 tons per week in the early stages of the war. This increase is due to the enemy's control of the Atlantic coast. Currently, most British shipyards are engaged in building naval vessels, so we rely heavily on the United States for the supply of merchant ships. Several cargo ships have already been ordered from the United States and can be delivered next year. (27th Reuters)

### Sino-Vietnamese Economic Negotiations to be Moved to Tokyo, France has Appointed a Representative to Negotiate in Japan, The Governor-General of Vietnam will Also Send Representatives to Participate

Hanoi – Special Envoy Matsumiya, leader of the Japanese economic delegation, has been here for over a month, holding multiple talks with representatives of the Governor-General of Vietnam. With a spirit of maximum understanding, they have reviewed the viewpoints of both France and Japan. The Japanese delegation has thus obtained sufficient information to serve as the basis for future formal economic negotiations between the two sides. It is learned that these negotiations will be moved to Tokyo, Japan, in a short period. The French government has recently appointed a delegation to negotiate in Japan to formulate new conditions for trade relations between Japan and France. This delegation will be led by the former Governor-General of Indochina, Robin, and will include Colonial Ministry Inspector Lyuffier, Production Department Technician Notin, and Pomar as Secretary-General.

In addition, regarding 1,400 tons of Chinese goods that were previously deemed by Vietnamese officials to be in violation of customs regulations, they will be auctioned off in Saigon. However, the proceeds will still belong to the original owners. Well-informed sources say that the Japanese request to manage customs and establish inspectors in Saigon is using these goods as a pretext. (27th Associated Press)

Vietnam Denies it Will Expel American Consul

Hanoi – The Vietnamese government has formally requested Associated Press reporters to deny rumors that the Vietnamese government is considering expelling US Consul General Light, US Vice Consul Linton, and Associated Press Hanoi correspondent Jacobi, which have been continuously propagated by Japanese radio and newspapers. Linton and Jacobi were the parties involved in the photography incident in Haiphong last week. It is said that Jacobi attempted to photograph a Japanese soldier standing on top of a high-standing American flag on American property. The Japanese soldier then arrested Jacobi and the accompanying US Vice Consul Linton on charges of espionage and sent them to French authorities for investigation. After the US Consulate protested, the Japanese side replied that the blame would be entirely on the Americans. The US Consulate now considers the Japanese reply unsatisfactory and will raise a stronger protest. (27th Associated Press)

### British Press Magnate Rothermere Dies in Bermuda

London – London received news last night of the death of Lord Rothermere, the well-known British newspaper publisher and financier, on the island of Bermuda. Rothermere had accepted a special mission to the United States in May at the request of Minister of Aircraft Production Sir Beaverbrook. He subsequently sought treatment in New York due to illness. Shortly thereafter, he went to Bermuda to recover, but ultimately succumbed to his illness at the age of seventy-two. (27th Reuters)

Lord Rothermere was the brother of the former British press magnate Lord Northcliffe. His London newspapers include the "Daily Mail," the "Daily Mirror," the "Evening News," the "Sunday Dispatch," and many provincial newspapers. Rothermere served as the Director of the Army Clothing Department from 1916 to 1917 and as the Minister of Air from 1917 to 1918. Rothermere was quite close to the leader of the British Fascist Party, Mosley. He was a strong advocate for the restoration of Hungary and advocated for the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. Rothermere had engaged in a debate with the newspapers owned by the current Minister of Aircraft Production, Beaverbrook. After reconciliation, Rothermere handed over management of the "Daily Mail" to his son Esmond. This May, on the recommendation of Beaverbrook, the government sent Rothermere to the United States.

### Further Discussions on the European War 24: The Underground Life of Londoners

The government originally did not allow residents to take refuge in subway stations during air raids, but the public air raid shelters were insufficient, and the people ultimately valued their lives above all else, so they could not care about anything else and could only temporarily "make do." The poor in London's East End regarded the subway stations as their only paradise. These stations were built 150 feet underground, making them extremely safe. Every evening, or when air raid sirens went off, men, women, old, and young all went there. There, they slept on the platforms, on the stairs, or on the escalators. Every night, there were a total of 120,000 people sleeping on the ground at the Piccadilly, Leicester Square, Holborn, Covent Garden, and Bank stations.

At night, the platforms of the subway stations were packed, and everyone went to sleep. Some brought blankets and pillows, while others leaned against the cold, damp walls in their clothes and fell asleep snoring. Some more sophisticated people even brought hot water bottles filled with snacks, warm water, black tea, or coffee, so they could rinse their mouths, freshen up, and go straight to work in the factory in the morning. There were not many "good seats" in the subway stations, so the early bird got the worm. Before it was even dark, many men and women ran into the station, spread out their blankets on the platform, and practiced their good habit of going to bed early. As for those who came later and could not find a space, they had to choose a step on the escalator to spend the night. The most annoying thing was that when the trains came, the sound of the wheels shattered the silence, making it difficult for everyone to sleep.

Those who took refuge in the subway stations during air raids, apart from those who did not have time to bring anything in a hurry, many people still carried boxes and baskets. Most of the things they could take away and their personal belongings were taken with them. Therefore, in the chaotic situation, it was like travelers rushing to catch a train. The difference was that you didn't need to bring bedding, pillows, chairs, or cloth beds on the train. But on the platforms of the subway stations, these things were everywhere. Some more leisurely people brought bananas, beer, and the like, preparing for a feast. Everyone was crowded in the subway station, which was of course far from being as good as the basements of large hotels. Fortunately, the ventilation equipment inside was not bad, and the air was not too foul. However, there was no hot or cold water at all, and the toilet facilities were very lacking. Each station only had two toilets, and they were not originally designed to serve overnight guests, so naturally there were many inconveniences. This situation was not unique to subway stations. Even the public air raid shelters built by the government were only intended to provide temporary refuge for residents when they were first planned and built, but they did not expect the German planes to bomb continuously, day and night, for two months without stopping.

Most of those who took refuge in the subway stations were from the middle and lower classes. Most of them worked in factories and usually lived in two- or three-story houses. They were not homeless people. Those whose houses were destroyed and who had no personal property were taken care of by the government in shelters, so they did not bother to take refuge in the stations. Even worse than the subway stations were the warehouses near the docks. These large warehouses were made of reinforced concrete and were very strong, much more so than the small houses where ordinary people lived. Whenever an air raid siren went off, they were always full of people. There was no ventilation equipment and no gaps. The windows and doors were closed tightly, and many people were crowded inside, hot and stuffy. The mix of people here was really complicated, even more so than in the subway stations. People of all kinds were lying all over the ground, including breastfeeding mothers, babies, black-skinned Indians, coffee-colored East Indians who had just landed from sailing, white dockworkers, prostitutes, burly dockworkers, and poor people from London's East End. They could always find a place to hide on the ground, but who would feel safe? Therefore, no matter who it was, they would desperately try to dig underground if possible.

The basements of London's major commercial banks and department stores were also excellent air raid shelters. Dickens & Jones on Regent Street was one of the best. Anyone who was relatively poor could take refuge here during air raids. There was good ventilation, and there were washing and toilet facilities. There was also a small bar where you could have a cup of tea for two pence and a piece of cake for four pence. The lights went out after 10:30, and everyone woke up and left early in the morning. Every day at 4:00 in the afternoon, many people were waiting outside the company's door to go in, but the door would not open until 7:00 unless there was an air raid siren. This kind of place was better than nothing and more than enough, and it was an invaluable public air raid shelter.

About one-third of London residents slept in the underground stations, warehouses, and basements of various institutions mentioned above. Another third lived in private air raid shelters, and the remaining third still slept in their own beds. About 40% of the total population of London slept less than four hours a night. Men slept more soundly than women, and children slept better than both men and women. Parents with young children slept the least. In large-scale air raid shelters, the most terrible thing was the outbreak of infectious diseases, because there were so many people and it was difficult to manage. The government was trying its best to install various sanitation facilities.

The so-called "Anderson" air raid shelter was designed by the Home Office specifically for private or family use. Those who could afford it and had space in their backyard or garden mostly built one. Many were also built by the government at its own expense for public use. It was supported by an iron frame inside. The entrance was above the ground and dug deep down, accommodating several people. The top was semi-circular and sloped down, with sandbags and soil piled on top. Some even planted melons, fruits, and vegetables. The internal equipment of this small-scale air raid shelter was simple or complex, depending on the owner's interest. Some people connected the electricity wires in the house to the air raid shelter, so they could study at their desks at night with bright light. In the morning, they could boil some tea and go to the office after eating. People with good taste also put a bookshelf in the corner and hung photos and pictures on all sides to adjust the monotonous air inside. There were also quite a few people who placed radios inside.

When the German air force began to attack England, families with children put their children to sleep in small beds. When they heard the air raid siren, they moved them to the air raid shelter. After the air raid siren was lifted, they moved them back to their original places. Later, because there were too many air raids and it was too troublesome to move them often, they simply put the small beds in the air raid shelter. They said their evening prayers in the air raid shelter at night. Whether there was an air raid or not, they had developed a habit of sleeping in the air raid shelter. (To be continued)

### The Authorities of the Two Concessions Approve the Telephone Surcharge. The Number of Calls is Reduced Simultaneously. The Increased Fees are Very High and Difficult for Citizens to Bear

The Shanghai Telephone Company, on the pretext of installing new machines, about 16,000 households, because the cost of the machine is high, submitted a request to the工部局 to increase the price. However, because its pricing method is implemented in layers, its degree far exceeds the records of various public utilities, which has caused strong opposition from residents throughout the city, and public opinion is in an uproar. They unanimously requested the Chang局 to re-review and reduce it. All sectors of the city are waiting for the authorities to condescend to public opinion. However, according to reliable information yesterday, the工部局 and the 法公董局 have approved the telephone price increase. The company also decided to start implementing it in the two concessions on December 7. According to the information released by the 工部局 Intelligence Office, the method is as follows:

Increased Fees and Reduced Number of Calls

The 工部局 has recently approved the Shanghai Telephone Company's revision of the telephone fee schedule and the method of collecting temporary surcharges, which will be implemented from November 7. The charging method is as follows: (1) For residential telephones, the number of free calls per month is reduced from 100 to 65, and for business telephones, it is reduced from 150 to 100. The fee for each call exceeding the above number of calls is increased from 3 cents to 7 cents. The current basic monthly telephone fee remains the same. (2) A surcharge of 30% will be levied on all local telephone fees (i.e., a surcharge of 30% will be levied on the basic monthly telephone fee and the increased extra call fee). (3) Installation fees and machine relocation fees will increase by 100% to 150%. (4) The deposit paid by new users should be equal to the basic monthly fee for two years, but the above deposit will be fully refunded if the phone is kept for two full years, and will be refunded pro rata if it is kept for less than two years.

The Demand is Extremely High

According to the company, the demand for telephones from citizens since 1938 can be said to be extremely high, and it is difficult to cope with. Last year, 15,407 new installations were requested. This year and next year, the average is estimated to be 20,600. Recalling that from 1932 to 1938, the average number of requests for new installations was less than 370. It is doubtful whether this development is temporary or permanent. The company currently charges according to the fee schedule approved during 1937. Considering the fee situation of other public utilities and the prices of various commodities, telephone fees are relatively low. In addition, the various industries in this city are developing very rapidly, and the population is overcrowded. Although it is not permanent, the demand for telephones has therefore turned into a sharp increase.

Increased Cost of Adding Machines

In a certain period, the company was able to use the phones dismantled in the second half of 1937 and meet the external needs with the remaining equipment. At that time, the foreign exchange situation was much better than it is now. Recently, due to the greater demand for telephones, various parts and components must be added, so the cost has also increased, especially those parts and components that must be purchased from abroad.

Reasons for the Company's Price Increase

The reason for reducing the number of basic calls and increasing the price of exceeding the number of calls is to reduce the number of calls on the one hand, and to increase the speed of calls on the other hand, and to enable the company to connect a large number of additional phones to the existing switchboard as soon as possible. The reason for increasing the installation fee and the machine relocation fee is partly to offset the increase in wages and material costs. As for the reason for increasing the deposit, it is to provide a considerable guarantee for the company and users to resist the general temporary new users.

Income Increased by 70%

The company's income according to the current charging method not only cannot generate a considerable profit for the investment, but also is not enough to offset the annual depreciation amount. For this reason, the company requested that in addition to the above-mentioned surcharge method, a surcharge item be added so that the company's total income can cope with various expenses (including machine depreciation), and at the same time, its investment can generate the profit allowed by the business charter. In addition, the deficit under its depreciation and other items will also be compensated to a considerable extent. According to the revised fee schedule, the company's income is estimated to increase by 70%. It is hoped that after the increase, there will be surplus funds to engage in the expansion of equipment. The company really cannot consider this under the current situation.

The Bureau Discusses and Approves It

This case has been carefully discussed by the 工部局 for a long time. As a result, it was approved as above, and the 法租界 Public Works Department replied that it agreed and will be implemented from December 7. However, the surcharge item will be reconsidered at any time after 12 months of implementation.

Announced in Advance Without Waiting for Discussion

According to a reporter from 平明社, although the above-mentioned four principles of price increase have been proposed and approved in previous board meetings, the 工部局 announced it in advance yesterday afternoon after receiving the reply from the 法公董局 without waiting for the notification of yesterday afternoon's 4:00 board meeting, which made those familiar with the situation of the 工部局 feel surprised. The Chinese and Japanese directors of the 工部局 are said to be preparing to propose a discussion on the excessive telephone price increase at yesterday afternoon's board meeting.

The Overall Calculation of the Fee Increase is Extremely High

Judging from the principle of price increase announced by the 工部局, the fee increase is very large. Now, leaving aside the installation, relocation, and deposit fees, and only calculating the call fee, the telephone call fee will be charged at the following price from the 7th of next month: (1) Residential telephone, the original monthly fee is 6 yuan and 50 cents, now plus 30%, it is 8 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen. The number of basic calls is reduced from 100 to 65, and each call is 1 jiao and 3 fen. (2) Business telephone, from the original monthly fee of 10 yuan, it is increased to 13 yuan. The number of basic calls is reduced from 150 to 100, and each call is also 1 jiao and 3 fen. (3) The call fee beyond the basic number of calls, in addition to increasing from 2 or 3 fen to 7 fen per call, must also be added with a surcharge of 30%, increasing to 9 fen and 1 li per call. The telephone price increase is so large, which really makes all general users unable to bear it.

### The United States and Japan Held Consultations on the "Da Sheng" Steamer

Regarding the issue of the American ship "Da Sheng" being detained by the Japanese Navy in the waters of Dinghai at the beginning of this month and not yet released, it is reported that officials from the US and Japanese consulates held consultations once yesterday afternoon in order to reach an agreement. According to US consulate officials, the second protest regarding the detention of the "Da Sheng" will not be filed at least before the two sides talk. The US has received a reply from the Japanese side to the first protest, but US officials believe that the content of this reply is too general and unsatisfactory. The "Da Sheng" is owned by the 華泰 Motor Steamer Company and was stopped by a Japanese Navy cruiser on November 1 on its voyage from Shanghai to Japan, half a day's journey away. Two days later, it was taken to Dinghai and is still there. Passengers on board were initially not allowed to disembark until November 11, when they were transported to Shanghai by a Japanese ship. It is reported that the 37 passengers and 20 crew members on board the "Da Sheng" were very panicked when they caught sight of the Japanese warship. At that time, all papers and documents were thrown into the sea, and money was hidden in secret places on the ship.

### Rumor that Chinese Goods Detained in Vietnam Will Be Confiscated and Nationalized. Vietnamese Governor Orders Customs to Prepare for Auction. Cargo Owners are Panicked and Telegraph the Ministry for Negotiations

Since the Vietnamese Governor ordered a ban on the export of goods transiting through Vietnam, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiations, also asked the Saigon Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to strive for the release of the goods from the Vietnamese Governor. A reporter from 新聲社 inquired at the 中法 Express Company yesterday and learned that the company had just received a telegram from Saigon, reporting that the Vietnamese Governor had ordered the customs to present the detained goods for auction, confiscation, and nationalization. Upon hearing this, the cargo owners were panicked, believing that the detained goods were all owned by legitimate Chinese merchants, and there was no reason to confiscate them in law or in sentiment. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to stop it, the Kunming General Office of the 中法 Express Company has also submitted a request to the Chinese government for negotiations.

The Transportation Company Relieves Itself of Responsibility

The Haiphong Company of 中國 通運 Company issued a notice stating that it had previously accepted the entrustment of merchants to transit and store goods in Vietnam that had not been transported, and had already obtained export permits, completed the formalities, and chartered ships, preparing to load and depart from Haiphong immediately. Now, the Vietnamese government suddenly prohibits the export of all goods transiting through Vietnam, resulting in the failure of previous efforts. The company's time and economic losses are huge, which is not to mention. The company is exhausted in terms of the goods stored by customers, and it will be difficult to continue to be responsible for any accidents in the future. Please ask the customers to find a way to pick up the goods quickly to avoid losses.

Cargo Owners Send Personnel to Vietnam One After Another

The goods jointly transported by Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou were previously transported from Shanghai to Haiphong and Saigon in Vietnam, and then transferred to Kunming via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Since the Yunnan-Vietnam transportation was interrupted due to the landing of Japanese troops in Vietnam, a large number of goods are detained in Haiphong and Saigon in Vietnam, especially from Sichuan and Yunnan. The goods are mainly cotton yarn and piece goods. Now, in addition to asking the government to negotiate with Vietnam, the cargo owners have recently sent personnel to Haiphong, Saigon, and other places to negotiate for the pickup of goods, sell them locally, or return them to Hong Kong. However, it is still difficult to predict whether the negotiations will be smooth.

### London Sends a Letter to Shanghai Reporting on Air Force Facilities

A certain American journalist in this city recently received a letter from a friend in London, describing the current status of British Air Force training. It is said that the British Air Force originally planned to train 50,000 pilots and aviators every year. At present, the plan has been implemented step by step. Of the 67 aviation schools planned to be established in Canada, 22 have already been opened, with about 2,300 students training in them. In addition, there are 16 replenishment schools and 88 airfields, 60 of which are newly built. Canada is the main site for implementing this plan. In the past three years, it has spent 120 million pounds and trained 25,000 pilots and aviators. In addition, Australia and New Zealand have also made great contributions. If Australia's plan is fully implemented, it is estimated that by March 1943, there will be 57,500 aviators and 36 aviation schools. New Zealand can also train 900 pilots and 1,000 people receiving preliminary training every year. In addition to the Canadian Air Force Regiment that has been assigned to protect Britain, Canada also has 116,000 air force personnel, and there are also 1,000 Canadian aviators in the Royal Air Force.

### American Rice and Wheat are Shipped to Shanghai for Relief Distribution. Poor People in Shanghai Will Benefit Greatly This Winter. A Batch of Supplies Will Be Received Every Month Thereafter. A Large Quantity of Medicines is Transported to the Interior via the Yunnan-Burma Road

The 150 tons of rice and 350 tons of wheat (worth approximately 450,000 yuan) that the American Red Cross arrived in Shanghai last Sunday (November 24) are sufficient to meet the needs of the local branch. It is said that this crushed wheat has only been ground once, and all the original quality of the wheat is completely preserved, so its nutritional value is even greater than that of fully ground wheat. The wheat and rice are stored in white cloth bags, and a paper strip of the American Red Cross is attached to one side. It is said that application letters have arrived in Shanghai from all over, from Peiping to Guangzhou, requesting to allocate a part. Therefore, the Shanghai branch also expects to continue to receive more and greater assistance from the United States in the future. It is expected that in the next few months, a batch of transportation will arrive in Shanghai every month.

The Distribution Method Has Been Agreed Upon

After the association agreed on the distribution method on the 26th, the distribution has started since the previous day. In the past two days, 6,400 bags of wheat and 4,115 bags of rice have been allocated. The distribution method is determined according to the situation in various places. Because wheat is more scarce in various areas of the occupied areas, wheat is allocated to all areas. Rice is the main allocation in this city. The number of bags allocated to Jiangsu Province are as follows: Wuxi 460 bags (same below), Songjiang 600 bags, Zhenjiang 1,000 bags, Suzhou 1,000 bags, Changzhou 400 bags. Zhejiang Province: Hangzhou 1,000 bags, Huzhou 1,000 bags, Jiaxing 500 bags, Dinghai 400 bags. In this city, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association gets 400 bags of rice, the Catholic Church's organizations get 2,200 bags of rice and 100 bags of wheat, the Puyi Society gets 300 bags of rice, the Tongren Second Refugee Hospital gets 400 bags of rice, and the Tongren and Guangren Hospitals get 600 bags of rice.

200 Tons of Medicines Transported to China

The American Red Cross has two branches in China, one serving in the Far East, with its president's office in Shanghai, and one serving in Western China, with its general office in Chongqing. In addition, there is also a transportation office in Lashio, Burma, managing the transportation of medicines into China via Burma. There will be 200 tons of medicines transported to the interior of China via the Burma Road, including preservatives, anesthetics, antimalarials, and antidiarrheals, totaling approximately US$300,000. Whether there will be more in the future depends on the situation of the Burma Road and the convenience of transportation. The chairman of the American Red Cross Eastern China Branch is Pei Sai, and his secretary is You Te. It is said that the American Red Cross plans to transport 500,000 quinine tablets from Java to China, which are currently in transit. It is generally expected that 6,000 boxes of toys will arrive in Eastern China before Christmas.

Baker Arrives in Shanghai to Preside Over Everything

The news that Thailand has recently made a request has been rampant, and the price of rice has been manipulated by speculators, and has risen again. The general poor people and refugees in this city are waiting for the enthusiastic relief from all parties at home and abroad. When the various charitable organizations in this city are carrying out winter relief plans, everyone is very pleased to hear the news of the arrival of American rice, wheat, and accounts. This not only shows that the friendship between China and the United States has become more and more cordial, but also the lives of the general civilians in this season may be improved as a result. According to Mr. You Te, he cannot specify what kind of relief supplies the United States is currently shipping to Shanghai. All distribution methods will be decided in Rangoon. The association's director-general, Baker, has been working hard to raise funds in the United States, so he has obtained enthusiastic support from the United States. Baker will devote himself to the work of the Red Cross in the future and will soon return to Shanghai from Chongqing. As for the rumors that American charitable organizations will cooperate with Chinese philanthropists to distribute relief, it has not been confirmed.

A Large Number of Winter Clothes Will Arrive Next Month

The Philadelphia Friends Association branch in this city has made many achievements in refugee relief work since its establishment in March last year. It has repeatedly received various relief clothes from Australia, New Zealand, and various sectors of this city, such as coats, shirts, T-shirts, shoes, socks, and other miscellaneous items. After cooperating with other charitable organizations in this city, they are distributed to refugees who have migrated to Shanghai from the German-occupied areas of Europe. It is learned that on December 8, the "President Cleveland" will transport two large packages of new and old winter clothes from the United States to the Friends Association of Feizhou for distribution to European refugees.

### The Citibank Hankou Branch Announces its Closure

Business Merged into the Shanghai Branch. The Citibank Hankou branch has recently announced its closure due to the unstable commercial environment there. According to Citibank in this city, all affairs of the Hankou branch will be merged into the Shanghai branch for handling from December 12.

### Punish Severely for Exploitation of Heavy Interest Rates and Unauthorized Price Increases

In the occupied areas, after the war, the National Government authorities publicized that the interest rate on ordinary loans should not exceed 20%, that is, the highest annual interest rate should not exceed 2%. Nowadays, the trend of exploiting heavy interest rates and merchants manipulating prices by taking advantage of the war has not been eradicated, which is enough to affect people's livelihood. It is reiterated that the above-mentioned prohibition should be strictly enforced. Those who exploit heavy interest rates and hoard goods and raise prices without authorization will be severely punished in accordance with the regulations promulgated in the past. This government order applies to the current occupied areas. Those who are not subject to temporary political forces are allowed to report after the war is over, and those who rely on power to form such acts will be punished one level higher.

### The French Concession Police Make a Solemn Statement

Strictly Prohibiting Flower Societies Has Never Changed. Recently, there have been rumors that someone has opened a flower society in the French Concession. In fact, the French Concession authorities have always strictly prohibited this kind of organization and still strictly implement it according to the regulations of the Public Works Department and the current laws and regulations, and have never changed their policies.

### Search and Seizure Again on Route de Say Zoong and Other Locations; Tense Situation Causes Panic Among Residents; Rumor of One Worker Arrested

Residents in the area of extra-settlement roads in Western Shanghai and within the concessions now regard it as a perilous place, due to the frequent unexpected disturbances. Yesterday morning around 10:30, suddenly a large group of over a hundred Japanese soldiers and several dozen so-called "municipal police," in four Japanese military trucks, arrived at the Yaojia Garden area of Yuyuan Road. They divided into groups to surround Bailinan Road, Route de Say Zoong, and Dunsing Road, thoroughly searching residents and pedestrians, creating a tense situation. Residents in the area, recalling the previous blockades of places like Lane 608 on Yuyuan Road, were filled with panic. Fortunately, they left around noon. It is rumored that a worker wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants was arrested and taken away. The reason for the Japanese military search is unknown. Does the government, while permitting price increases for all trades, also consider the livelihood of ordinary people?

Recommendation to Abolish

A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency has learned that the rice market situation has worsened recently due to renewed rumors. Although national and foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, the local reserves are steadily increasing. However, major hoarders control the spot goods and remain unmoved. Even small hoarders are playing the market, and the trading is like a former exchange, filled with speculative buying and selling, causing prices to rise. The Market Management Committee is unable to lower prices. The only solution is thorough management and the implementation of public sales. While the government cannot exercise its authority, the Municipal Council should take responsibility during this extraordinary period. The original measures for punishing rice merchants are too lenient. Currently, the most important point for stabilizing prices is to immediately lower the price of second-grade rice; otherwise, how will ordinary people survive?

### Noodles to Increase in Price Today; Arrangements for Procuring Foreign Rice Finalized; Ordering from Rangoon if Absolutely Necessary

A certain rice firm revealed that it had received a telegram from a Hong Kong counterpart stating that a Hong Kong shipping company had received an urgent telegram from its Vietnam branch. The Vietnamese government had ordered the prohibition of French ships sailing to Hong Kong at the beginning of this month. However, ways have been found to ship Saigon rice directly to Macau, and then it can be transshipped to Hong Kong and Shanghai. At the same time, the export of Siam rice has more than doubled, most of which is shipped to Hong Kong and Shanghai. According to a rice industry group, if absolutely necessary, large quantities of foreign rice can be procured from Rangoon (Burma) and shipped to Shanghai for adjustment. Therefore, there is no need to worry about a food shortage in the city.

Future of Rice Prices

The key issues leading to the soaring rice prices are as follows: (1) Although the national rice production is ample, the supply is still not double that of the past, making it easy for speculative rice merchants to use as an excuse. (2) The unstable international situation and the tense situation in rice-producing areas have caused people to hoard and refuse to sell easily, resulting in an imbalance between buying and selling, and making goods scarce and expensive, leading to frequent price increases. (3) The relevant authorities fail to keep their promises and miss opportunities, relying only on empty words, resulting in a loss of credibility. Therefore, to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai, the relevant authorities must supervise and direct policies, seize the opportunity to order large quantities of national and foreign rice, dispatch special ships to transport it to Shanghai for storage, increase food reserves, and supply the rice to the market at discounted prices to calm the people.

Noodle Price Increase

The Municipal Council has approved the price increase for the flat-priced flour sold by Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills, from 17.3 yuan to 18.3 yuan starting from the 25th of this month, increasing the cost of noodles. In order to find a relief measure, the Noodle Industry Association sent representatives to visit Vice Director-General Hoderkui of the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday. Mr. Ho personally received them and approved the increase of the market price of noodles from 3.6 cents per catty to 3.8 cents, to be implemented starting today. At the same time, it was instructed that all members of the industry should uniformly comply with the price list agreed upon by the association and not increase the price of noodles privately.

### Kidnapping Cases Become Increasingly Bizarre; Two Young Children Abducted Yesterday; Rumor That a Two-Year-Old Child of the Chuan Family Was Rescued Midway; Four-Year-Old Son of the Ho Family Abducted and Missing

Yesterday morning, two cases of kidnapping young children occurred successively on Race Course Road and Dunsing Road in Western Shanghai in the Public Concession. However, the former child was intercepted on the spot, while the latter's whereabouts are unknown. The details of the two cases are as follows:

Kidnappers Entered Building and Carried Away Child

The kidnapping case on Race Course Road occurred at 7:30 yesterday morning. Three kidnappers broke into the home of Chuan Lung-chien, a Ningbo native, at No. 18, Chengqi Lane, No. 69 on Race Course Road. They went straight upstairs to Chuan's bedroom. One kidnapper stood guard by the stairs, while the other two showed pistols, preventing Mr. and Mrs. Chuan from making any noise. They picked up Chuan's two-year-old son, Yi-ping, from the bed, went downstairs, and fled out the door. Chuan saw the kidnappers leave and immediately got up and chased after them, and reported to the police post. The police bravely went forward to pursue the kidnappers. Seeing that the plan had failed, and because the police sirens were blaring, they had no intention of staying, and hastily threw the hostage to the ground and fled wildly. The patrolling police in the area, hearing the alarm, came to encircle and capture them. As a result, one kidnapper was caught on the spot, while the other two escaped without a trace. Chuan runs the Lao Yongcheng Leather Goods Shop, and his family is only moderately well-off.

Ho Child Abducted on the Way to School

Only fifty minutes after the previous case occurred, another kidnapping case occurred on Dunsing Road in Western Shanghai. Ho Shih-chen, a native of Anhui, is the former president of Chi-Chih University and a practicing lawyer. He resides at No. 30, Lane 42 on Dunsing Road. His four-year-old son, Tso-kun, is currently studying at the Xizhen Girls' Elementary and Middle School in the Zhamiao Lane, Jing'an Temple. At 8:20 yesterday morning, Tso-kun, accompanied by a bodyguard from home, took a chartered car to school. Unexpectedly, as soon as the car left the lane, six kidnappers suddenly appeared. Three kidnappers produced pistols and abducted Tso-kun into a silver car No. 18253 parked on the corner of the road and sped away. Afterward, the Ho family reported to the Jing'an Temple police station and requested an investigation. The police found that the car used by the kidnappers was rented from the Silver Car Branch on Yuyuan Road at 8:00 am by the kidnappers. The driver, Yu Shao-yang, drove the car. Unexpectedly, when the car passed Yaojiajiao, Caojiadu, the kidnappers in the car pulled out a gun and forced the driver to get out of the car, detaining him in a small bungalow for a long time. Around 9:00 am, the guarding kidnapper released Yu. Yu also reported to the police station. Around 10:00 am, the car was found within the jurisdiction of the police station. The police station is now investigating the case. It is reported that when the kidnappers carried out the kidnapping, they confiscated the bodyguard's pistol. The whereabouts of the abducted Tso-kun are still unknown.

### Relocation of Western Boys' School Not Yet Decided

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post*, parents of students at the Western Boys' School continue to express strong dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council's decision to relocate the school to the barracks left by the British troops in Zhaofeng Park. Their reasons are that the British barracks are insufficient for classrooms, the location is inconvenient, and there are many dangers. The Municipal Council remains silent on the progress of this matter. According to Mr. Nash, Assistant Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, the situation has not changed since yesterday. Relevant personnel are holding meetings and may reconsider the matter. The Bureau does not need to inform the press of developments at any time. However, Nash refused to confirm that the Municipal Council had decided to move the Western Boys' School away from its current temporary location (No. 2811, Kaina Road), only stating that the Bureau is still considering the entire matter. After the British troops stationed in Shanghai withdrew, their barracks in Zhaofeng Park, consisting of fourteen wooden houses, were partially damaged. It is reported that the Municipal Council has been sending workers to actively repair them since the 10th of this month, and it is expected to be completed within a month.

### Governments in Various Parts of the Far East Inspect Mail to Shanghai

Since the situation in the Far East has become tense, governments in various places have been inspecting incoming and outgoing mail. According to the Datong News Agency's inquiries with the Shanghai Post Office, a large number of mails arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, and other places have been opened and inspected by local governments. After inspection, they are sealed and signed on the opening of the envelope and stamped with the inspector's seal. The procedure is very thorough, but due to the inspection, the round trip will inevitably be slightly delayed.

### Zhao Wuji's Art Exhibition

Starting today, the works of the young painter Zhao Wuji will be displayed at the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road from today until the 2nd of next month, holding a solo exhibition. Zhao's early works were deeply influenced by the famous modern French painter Matisse. Later, Zhao studied the works of modern Western painters such as Derain, Gauguin, and Cézanne, and his style changed, his thinking became serious, and he reached a stage of magnificence and maturity. In addition, after the war, he traveled to various places in the Southwest and experienced much of real life. Therefore, his later works are more strongly reflective of the spirit of the times.

### Municipal Council Considers Abolishing Petty Rents; French Concession Already Has Rectification Plan

Since the French Concession Municipal Council recently proposed abolishing the petty rent system, the Public Concession Municipal Council may also take similar action. According to a spokesman for the Municipal Council yesterday, the Municipal Council is currently considering the matter. Whether this matter was discussed at the special meeting of the Municipal Council yesterday, and whether it will be carried out jointly with the French Concession Municipal Council after a circular, will be announced to the public soon, but it cannot be revealed at this time. At the same time, French Consul General Magre is still considering the French Concession Municipal Council's proposed measures regarding various rent issues. The Shanghai Tenants' Association calls the abuses such as petty rent "fraud," and the French Concession Municipal Council's recently published long report also states the illegality of this practice. The French Concession Municipal Council believes that the fierce movement against landlord exploitation in the French Concession is related to the arrival of French Consul General Magre. It is said that Magre is very interested in rectifying the chaos of rental housing in the French Concession.

### Land Rent Calculated in Pounds; Lawsuit Over Different Exchange Rates

Hutong Foreign Firm Charges According to HSBC's Exchange Rate

Zhu Jieren Uses Central Bank's Exchange Rate as Standard

Special First Court Ruled Against Zhu Jieren Yesterday

Dozens of businesses and residences, such as Tongyuchun and Sanyou Industrial Society on Nanyang Road in the Public Concession, are owned by real estate developer Zhu Jieren, and the land belongs to Hutong Foreign Firm. The houses there are

Built on Leased Land

The original land lease contract between the two parties was for a period of fifteen years, from 1916 to 1941, expiring next year. The houses will also belong to Hutong Foreign Firm. In the land lease contract, it was originally stipulated that the land rent would be calculated in Shanghai taels converted from pounds. For more than twenty years, Zhu Jieren paid the rent in Chinese currency converted from pounds. In recent years, because the Central Bank's posted

Sino-British Exchange Rate

is one shilling and two and a half pence, which is very different from the rate posted by HSBC, Zhu Jieren argues that the rent should be paid based on the Central Bank's rate. Hutong Foreign Firm disagrees. Because Zhu Jieren had owed land rent for six installments up to July of this year, with each installment being three months and the rent being one hundred pounds, the total amount owed was six thousand six hundred pounds. The firm recently commissioned lawyers Ma Shouhua, Cao Shoulin, Xu Runquan, etc., to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court, requesting that the defendant Zhu Jieren

Pay the Owed Rent

of six hundred pounds, based on HSBC's exchange rate. After reviewing the case, Judge Li Hu of the Civil Division repeatedly examined the results. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, the court ruled that the defendant Zhu Jieren should pay the plaintiff Hutong Foreign Firm six thousand six hundred pounds for land rent, and the conversion should be based on HSBC's exchange rate. The plaintiff's request for provisional execution was rejected.

### Painter Disregards Human Relations and Adultery with His Nephew's Wife

Uncle and Nephew Clash; Both Seriously Injured

Wu Chunyuan, a Yangzhou native residing in the pavilion room at No. 59, Lane 590, Haining Road, is a painter. He is advanced in years and has always been fond of women. After his old wife passed away, he often enjoyed himself with female tea servers (i.e., waitresses) in various entertainment venues. Recently, his nephew Wu Hengmao and his wife, Dong, (24 years old and slightly attractive) moved in from somewhere to live in the attic on the second floor. Wu Chunyuan disregarded his status as an elder and teased Dong. Then, taking advantage of his nephew Hengmao's absence, he had sexual relations with Dong, secretly committing adultery several times. Later, his nephew Hengmao discovered this, but did not witness it. So he sent his wife Dong to work as a helper in a mansion at No. 29, Duofu Lane, Fuxu Road. At 5:20 on the 27th morning, the uncle and nephew suddenly had a big argument. Wu Chunyuan grabbed a sharp knife from the table, intending to kill his nephew. They grabbed each other and fought, resulting in both of them being seriously injured, bleeding profusely, and collapsing to the ground moaning. The second landlord, Wang Mingfang, urgently reported to the local Huizi police station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to the address. They sent the uncle and nephew to the Northern Tibet Road Refugee Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the case report was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case. Because both parties were seriously injured and unable to attend court, the judge was asked to postpone the hearing. Huang Risheng postponed the hearing until Wu Chunyuan and Wu Hengmao recover from their injuries and the facts are verified.

Bullets Fly on Baylor Road; One Thief Killed

Pig Vendor's Home Robbed, Suffers Heavy Losses; Three Thieves Flee; One Passerby Injured

Jie Meisheng, a Zhenjiang native, is a pig vendor and lives at No. 60, Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road in the French Concession. At about 4:30 yesterday afternoon, four robbers suddenly broke in. All four robbers produced guns, forbidding anyone from making a sound, and searched at will. They robbed gold and silver jewelry and cash, worth about 3,000 yuan in legal tender, and fled out the door. The victim followed and reported to nearby Chinese police. The police sounded the alarm. Knowing that things were not good, three robbers fled south on Ximen Road and Baylor Road, and one robber fled north on Baylor Road, firing shots to resist arrest along the way. The detectives also drew their guns and returned fire. The two sides exchanged more than twenty shots. As a result, one of the robbers fleeing north was hit by three shots, one in the head and two in the abdomen, and collapsed in a pool of blood at the entrance of Wangde Lane on Baylor Road, dying on the spot. A pistol and five bullets were found on him. The other three robbers escaped without a trace. At that time, Su Dinggan (43 years old, a native of Tongzhou), the old clerk of a coal shop at No. 562 Baylor Road, was carrying a load of coal balls on his shoulder when he passed near Wangde Lane and was hit in the right arm by a stray bullet. The police sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

### Securities Exchange Switchboard Operator Conspires With Gang for Fraud and Theft

Forgery of Warehouse Receipts to Defraud Yarn Payments; Six Criminals Arrested for More Than Ten Robbery Cases

Xu Zhongya, a native of Suzhou, works as a telephone operator for the Taifeng Yarn Shop in Room 213 of the Securities Building on Jiujiang Road. Therefore, he is very familiar with the transactions within the shop. Recently, Xu learned that Taifeng had purchased 20 bales of Huai yarn from Shengxing Yarn Shop at No. 1, Lane 24, Jiangxi Road, with the agreed market price being 25,225 yuan. Xu, before

the Transaction Was Completed

conspired with his friends Shen Yajie, Li Fanglun, Ji Huisheng, Li Zhenhua, and Lu Shiheng to forge a paper of Anyu Qianzhuang banknotes to Shengxing for delivery. Chengxing Shop believed that they were sent by Taifeng Shop, and handed over the warehouse receipt. After Shen and others obtained the warehouse receipt, they used the receipt to collect two banknotes of 25,225 yuan from Meifeng Xingye from Taifeng. However, these banknotes could not be directly cashed at the bank. Shen and others took the notes to Fei Wenwu Silver Shop on Nanjing Road and

Purchased Gold Bars

four gold bars, carried them to Gaoqiao in Pudong for temporary storage, and waited for the situation to calm down before selling and distributing the loot. However, the intricate fraud scheme created by Xu, Shen, and others was exposed due to the exposure of Anyu Zhuang's forged banknotes. After the two shops reported to the General Police Department, Chinese Inspector Jiang Shangpei and Detectives Ren Fengwu and Peng Bingsheng made every effort to investigate and completely exposed it. The detectives

Arrested

Xu Zhongya, Shen Yajie, Li Fanglun, Ji Huisheng, Li Zhenhua, Lu Shiheng, etc. at No. 520, Dongya Hotel, and No. 207, Sutai Hotel, etc.

The four gold bars were found in Gaoqiao. A pistol and five bullets were also found at the home of Li Fanglun at No. 210, Beihai Road. It was found that Xu and others, in addition to setting up fraud schemes, also specialized in robbing yarn shops, committing no less than ten cases. When they robbed, they always bound the plaintiffs, such as the case where Wuheng Qianzhuang's 4,000 yuan remittance to the Huafeng Exchange Shop in the Guohua Building was robbed,

Issue of Responsibility

A case that is now being litigated in court between Yuanheng and Huafeng, was also committed by Xu and others. Yesterday morning, the case was sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the defendants committed more than ten robbery cases in addition to fraud, and that the investigation was not yet complete. Therefore, it was requested that the hearing be adjourned. After reviewing the report and questioning the defendants, Chuan Lin ordered them to be detained for a later hearing.

### Financial Speculators Enter Foreign Exchange Futures

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's posted rates. The black market for British and American exchange remained tense. The American exchange rate once rose to 5.84375 yuan due to speculators' efforts to push up prices, while the supply from non-professionals was limited. Later, due to negative rumors, it rebounded, but ultimately softened due to hesitant sellers and extremely strong demand for futures. However, compared with the previous day, both the spot British and American exchange rates for this month were flat, while those for the next month were reduced by 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively.

Limited Supply from Foreign Banks

In the morning, the London big bar was flat for both near and far terms. The New York silver price remained flat. The London raw gold was fixed. The exchange rate between the British and American currencies was flat in Shanghai. The American currency was up slightly by two points against the British currency, but there was no market for the French currency. The central bank's posted rates for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with the British gold at 3.75 pence and the American exchange at 5.875 yuan, the same as the evening closing on the previous day. After opening, speculators aggressively pushed up the price of American exchange futures, and the market continued to tighten. It was estimated that non-professionals gave Chinese merchants 5.85 yuan for December, but because the supply from non-professionals was very thin and there were few positions, Chinese banks took the opportunity to sell American exchange for the next month at 5.84375 yuan. At 9:30, HSBC announced that the posted rates were uniformly unchanged, and the silver tax was also flat. Thereafter, rumors spread that a new Sino-American loan had been established. People reacted to the news by shorting the market, and speculators covered their positions. Foreign firms also closed their positions. The December price rose from 5.875 yuan to 5.90625 yuan. The market closed softly at noon, with the spot and current month's British currency at 3.75 pence and the American exchange at 5.875 yuan. The December British currency was at 3.734375 pence and the American exchange was at 5.84375 yuan, with the spot and current month's British and American exchange rates unchanged from the previous day, and the next month's rates tighter by 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively. There was no market in the afternoon.

Hong Kong's American Exchange Uniquely Tight

Gold Price Attempts to Rise but is Blocked; Swap Session Advanced by One Day

Yesterday's bare metal market rose and then suddenly fell back. The price broke into the 5,700 yuan mark several times. It was rumored that the bond market suddenly heard that the United States would continue to lend to China 50 million yuan, and people's minds changed from firm to uncertain. In the morning, it was heard that foreign exchange was tight, and silver shops covered their positions, and the price had risen to 5,725 yuan. Subsequently, the buying trend continued to fly up to 5,745 yuan. When the rumor of interest-bearing sales was heard, bill merchants and gold shops scrambled to sell short. As the multiple parties crushed each other, a falling wind arose, and it madly retreated to 5,688 yuan. Later, although a certain gold shop and silver shop were seen covering their positions, it sparked another sharp rise, but the foreign exchange had stopped tightening and returned to flat, causing another fallback, ultimately to 5,705 yuan, a small difference of ten yuan. The half-day transaction totaled more than 3,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon. Small money houses did dozens of taels of swaps, with buyers paying sellers four yuan. Cash transactions were not deserted. The price was initially six yuan lower than the term delivery, and was once as low as four yuan, later around five yuan. Ornament gold, customs gold, etc. were all flat. It is said that this 30-day swap session, coinciding with the holiday on Sunday, has been advanced to Saturday (29th) from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM. Thereafter, swaps will be reduced to once a month, taking place on the 15th of each month. If there is a holiday, it will be held one day in advance.

Bare Metal Falls by Ten Yuan

Early in the morning, the QianDui industry first entered the silver shop with 20 taels, at 5,725 yuan, which was ten yuan higher than the previous day. Because the silver shop was eager to cover its positions, it continued to rise by 20 yuan under the buying trend, and the gold shop traded 30 taels at 5,745 yuan. Later, it was heard that the outer cabinet was slightly longer, and the news of the success of the Sino-American loan was spread, and the interest-bearing empty sales wind was agitated, and the securities help out of the silver shop 20 taels, at 5,688 yuan. However, a certain silver shop saw the low price and continued to cover its positions, and the price improved to 5,725 yuan, and the gold entered the QianDui industry for 30 taels. The securities help and others suddenly came to vomit, and the small money house also sold, and retreated to the 700-yuan mark, and the securities help out of the gold shop 20 taels, 5,700 yuan, and the gold shop entered QianDui industry 20 taels at noon, rose back eight yuan, to 5,70 yuan. The silver shop entered the QianDui industry for ten taels at the closing, offsetting 5,705 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, with the bare metal having a ten-yuan difference and a fifty-seven-yuan change for half of the day. The brand gold sold by the current gold shop is more than ten yuan higher than the bare metal, and the closing is thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold is lower than the listed gold by fifty-sixty yuan, and it is rare to open.

〇〇〇〇〇Ornament Gold Has Not Changed〇〇〇〇〇The gold price per tael for ornaments in silver shops has not changed. The Da Tong Hang is listed at 590 yuan, and the New Tong Hang is similar to the above price, and the closing is about 30 yuan lower.

The Rise and Fall of Japanese and Korean Tickets Differ

Yesterday's foreign currency market, the price of bare metal, fell after rising. The British, American, and gold pounds also rose and then fell, and finally fell by five jiao. The British gold ticket tended to be steady, and the market price remained flat. The American gold ticket fluctuated. It once rose to 16.87 yuan, then retreated to 16.69 yuan, and finally ended at 16.78 yuan, a final rise of one point from the previous day. The supply and demand of Hong Kong tickets were uniform, and the market price remained flat. The Japanese gold ticket suddenly softened again, and the exchange rate retreated to 1.535 yuan. The demand for Korean tickets was more urgent, and the market price turned up, rising to 1.155 yuan in the evening.

### Grains: The Price of Foreign Rice Increased Again in the Afternoon, 60-70% Supported by Speculators

Spot foreign rice sales have slowed, and foreign demand has decreased. Yesterday's market saw stability, but rice shipments along various routes remain favored by hoarders and speculators. The market continues to rise, as the rice market has deviated from the norm. Sixty to seventy percent of market transactions are supported by speculators. Since futures foreign rice is being manipulated by speculative groups, the market fluctuates accordingly. Short-term speculators are also fueling the situation. As a result, the market was stable in the morning but surged again in the afternoon. Prices for both near-term and distant deliveries have increased by over a yuan. No. 1 Saigon spot rice, originally at $88.50 per bag in the morning, rose to $89.50 in the afternoon. December rice went from $84.50 to $85.00. No. 2 spot rice was at $85.00, with December at $83.30. November rice was only $82.50 in the morning, but it closed as high as $83.50 in the afternoon. Small grades have attracted the attention of local traders. December rice rose from $80.57 in the morning to $82.00 in the afternoon. Rice shipments along various routes were at $82.00 in the morning, with bids reaching over a yuan higher in the afternoon, but no deal was reached. Total rice transactions for the day were only 6,000 to 7,000 bags, and the Jardine Matheson & Co. still holds around 1,000 tons.

1,300-1,400 piculs of new japonica and tea rice arrived, mostly tea rice. Sales of tea rice are sluggish, causing the price of medicinal rice to decline by a yuan. It opened at $80.05. The supply of new japonica rice is stable, with no price changes. It opened at $93.00 per original bag, with select grades at $88.20 per picul and lower grades at $86.00. Du Jian rice also saw little change, selling for $78.30.

Glutinous rice sales have slowed, causing the price to soften by about half a yuan. Guanshi glutinous rice opened at $85.00 and $83.00. Hong Kong round-grain glutinous rice was $77.00, long-grain glutinous rice was $75.00 and $74.00, and yellow glutinous rice was $73.00.

Foreign flour is active, while factory flour is stable.

The spot flour market remains stable. Factory flour is still at $18.00 per bag. The two mountain factories have sold about 8,000 bags, designated for retail sale by various dealers, with no surplus available. Consequently, old-stock and Fuxin flour cannot be purchased for the time being. All dealers are paying attention to foreign flour. The recent arrival of Australian flour has taken advantage of this opportunity and is quite popular among local customers. It is reported that foreign hoarders have become active again and are accumulating shipments of foreign flour. The current price of Flower God brand flour is $19.50, with December futures opening at $18.50, up 20-30 cents from previous prices. Due to the high prices, demand for spot flour is increasing. Large shipments of foreign flour are expected to arrive in early December. The market will have to wait for the supply of foreign flour to lower prices.

The wheat market is also firm. Domestic supply has been scarce for a long time.

Chinese factories are unwilling to raise prices to buy wheat because they cannot find any available. However, it is rumored that Japanese factories have been actively buying available wheat. It is reported that a certain grain merchant has made a deal for 15,000 bags of Kuntan wheat for December delivery at $28.00. Domestic reserves are not yet depleted, but transport permits are difficult to obtain, so supplies cannot be transported for the time being.

### Securities: Long Positions Mostly Closed Out, Domestic Debt Market Remains Firm, London Foreign Debt Continues to Improve

The informal securities market was initially weak but later strengthened due to the surge in the prices of Chinese government bonds on foreign markets. However, excessive selling pressure prevented prices from rising. Class C bonds fell below $4.00 and then broke further, and are no longer as strong as before. Market sentiment has weakened slightly, and the future may see a period of consolidation before changing again based on domestic and international developments. Trading was light yesterday. Hongda and Xinfu were still buying, and Lianyi, Dunyu, and Hengfu also had demand in the morning. Changkang and Runli were bullish on small price increases. Zhenda, Jiufeng, and Changji were all selling, but prices continued to rise. Class C bonds broke through $64. In the afternoon, Hongda and Xinfu continued to buy, and Yitai, Shengda, and Lemao also bought. Prices opened firm, but Hengfu and Lianhe turned to selling. Dahua, Runde, and Tongshun sold heavily, and short positions also emerged. Prices broke below $4.00 again. In the end, prices recovered slightly by a few cents. 96 bonds saw little trading. Total trading volume was about 180-190,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Yesterday's stock trading saw 100 shares of China Trust stock change hands at $14. The Shanghai Stock Exchange saw slightly better sentiment, but it remained dim. Prices did not change much, and trading was very quiet.

A telegram from London, dated the 26th (Tuesday), reported that today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks showed improvements. Customs bonds "Yingfa" rose another one pound to $24. The long-dormant Sino-French-American 5% gold loan was listed at 35 to 40 pounds. The rest were stable, and British stocks also saw no changes.

### Silk and Tea: Very Few Silk Deliveries

Recently, deliveries of silk and tea have been very scarce, especially raw silk. As a result, trading in the local market has been quiet. Foreign firms found it difficult to raise prices. Yesterday, Da Chang, Yihe, and other foreign firms had some transactions. Jili silk, first and second grade, sold for $3,400. Top grade Da Shanghai and Guohua silk sold for $3,800. White factory silk, 0.22.78, sold for $4,650.

Due to a lack of outlets for white factory raw silk, prices are about $1,000 lower than those of foreign firms. In the Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuxi areas, prices are only around $2,700-$2,800. Due to the control system, they could not be shipped to Shanghai.

### Yarn and Cotton: Rumors of a Guangdong Syndicate Monopoly, Yarn Market Softens

The yarn market has returned to a volatile situation. This is because actual business has decreased, leading to weaker sentiment. Short sellers are active, and the market is soft, but the core of the long positions remains unchanged. Only a few followers have given up. Today, rumors spread that money was blocked at the Sha Yu Chung port, causing a temporary loss of confidence and a drop in prices. Reports that the Hong Kong syndicate is still handling nearly 100 bales of cotton yarn were vague. These rumors are difficult to confirm. Yesterday, five bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen and 255 bales to Hong Kong.

Shuang Ma opened bullish in the morning because the exchange rate had tightened in the afternoon of the previous day. Gold dealers and speculators were buying. The opening price was $1,222. After this opening, buying was strong, pushing the price up to $1,228. Suddenly, rumors arose in the market that the Guangdong syndicate had sold 400-500 bales of Shuang Ma futures, indicating a bearish outlook. As a result, short sellers became very active, and the market plummeted to $1,105. Following profit-taking, the price rose again to $1,216. The closing price was $1,210. It is estimated that 6,052 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma fell by $4. The amount of yarn purchased by each syndicate is listed below.

### Cotton Market: No Major Changes

Spot cotton trading was slightly active, but there were no major changes in prices. Industry sentiment was positive, but factories were not buying, so the trend remained hesitant. Fire-engine grass-cloth cotton was priced at $201, plain cotton at $168, and Brazilian cotton at $280. Yesterday, 220 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.

The international cotton market was firm and active in New York. Subsequently, due to heavy rainfall in cotton-growing areas and some short covering, the closing price rose by 2-3 points compared to the previous day. The price in India fell by more than one rupee.

Transactions of foreign cotton in Shanghai have been unusually quiet recently. All parties are taking a wait-and-see approach. The industry's willingness to purchase is very weak, so no transactions were heard of throughout the day.

### Piece Goods: Factory Orders Being Transferred to Warehouses

The factory cloth market was firm and steady yesterday, with frequent transactions. Cloth prices were stable. Dyeing factories and merchant groups were increasingly eager to buy. Factory and warehouse orders were being transferred to warehouses to avoid increased factory taxes. All warehouses reported being full. Sales prices were generally flat, but Luen Chang, Yihe, and other factories were short of valley cloth, and prices rose by 25-50 cents per piece. About 800 pieces of various cloths were traded in the local market. Guangdong and Hong Kong syndicates handled over 400 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, coarse cloth, and fine cloth. The Zhejiang and Fujian syndicates handled over 100 pieces of colored twill, bleached cloth, serge, and poplin. The Yantai syndicate in the north handled over 100 pieces of coarse cloth. Yesterday, 283 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 40 pieces to Xiamen, and 200 pieces are scheduled to be shipped to Yantai today.

Eastern cloth continued to soften. White cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill fell by 10-20 cents per piece. 12-pound fine cloth closed at $35.15, and Four Gentlemen Serge at $1.075.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Sales are So-So

Recently, the soybean market has been weak due to the rumored opening of Dalian and lackluster sales, leading to depressed sentiment and falling prices. The trend remained weak yesterday. However, in the after-market, as the Hong Kong syndicate continued to make purchases and oil prices remained relatively stable, prices temporarily tightened. Approximately 1,000 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan soybeans were initially offered at $35.50, and later at $35.70. Over 100 bags of Qingdao soybeans were offered at $34.00. 350 bags of Jiujiang late soybeans were offered at $35.50.

There was considerable activity in miscellaneous grains yesterday. 200 bags of soybeans were imported from Tianjin. 295 bags of soybeans, 4,740 pieces of soybean cake, and 1,422 cans of raw oil were exported to Xiamen. 575 bags of sesame seeds were exported to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate Slightly

The sugar market was relatively stable yesterday, with only minor fluctuations. The association's price quotations for spot sugar were: No. 24 coarse white sugar, in-warehouse, $72.60 per bag; out-of-warehouse, $72.00 to $71.90, up 10-20 cents. Dutch cotton white BW mark was still at $71.00. Spot Dutch red sugar was at $55.70, down 20 cents. Taikoo vehicle white B mark, December 5th delivery, was at $75.30; in-warehouse, $74.80, up 20 cents. DY mark, mid-warehouse, was at $68.30; HX mark, $68.10, both up 10 cents.

The following is a survey of Dutch sugar inventories as of the end of last week.

### Coal: Price of Hongji Coal Dust Rises After Large Shipments of Vietnamese Coal Arrive

Large shipments of Vietnamese coal have arrived in Shanghai. The French vessel Qujiang arrived on Sunday, transporting 8,500 tons of coal from Haiphong. The Siamese vessel, which arrived in Shanghai at around 3 PM yesterday, also carried 8,000 tons of coal from Haiphong. The vessels are currently docked at buoy No. 90 for unloading.

Hongji white coal dust has arrived with 7,000 tons of new stock, delivered by the French vessel Anadi. However, due to the high freight rates and increased insurance costs, the cost has naturally increased. Dealers of white coal dust are asking $155 per ton, more than $21 higher than previous prices. As a result, coal briquette factories have also raised their prices, temporarily adding $12 to the factory price, which is still insufficient to cover the cost of the new coal dust. Therefore, the industry hopes that freight rates will fall, and coal prices will naturally decrease.

### Metals: Huishi Iron Surges, Sales Suffer

Huishi iron transactions have been sluggish due to high prices. Demand from northern merchants in Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other areas has been intermittent and has not been shipped in large quantities. Demand is not what it used to be. Although canneries, thermos bottle factories, printing plants, cigarette companies, and biscuit factories in the local market occasionally make small purchases, the quantity is not large. Only 300-400 boxes were sold yesterday and the market is not very active. Standard market prices are rising due to high overseas prices. Yesterday, old steel factories sold at $180 and new steel factories at $170.

### Dried Goods: Miscellaneous Jujubes Continue to Weaken

The miscellaneous jujube market remains sluggish and continues to weaken. Yesterday, Fu jujubes opened at $34 and Chang jujubes at $25, both down 2 yuan. Over 100 bags were traded. Market prices for Fu jujubes were $36 and Chang jujubes $27. It is reported that even though production prices are low, it is difficult to break even when transporting.

### Tong'an Dried Longans: First Batch Suffers Losses

The first batch of Tong'an sun-dried longans, consisting of only eight boxes, has arrived. Due to reports of a large number of Hainan longans arriving, market prices have fallen by 30-40 yuan. As the desired price could not be obtained, each dan will suffer tens of yuan in losses.

### Medicinal Materials: Rhubarb Rises $20-$30

Rhubarb, produced in Sichuan, is a product for reducing fever and promoting bowel movements. Recent deliveries have been scarce, so market prices have been steadily rising. It is reported that the price rose by $20 earlier this month and has risen by another $20-$30 recently. The market price is now close to $900.

### Seafood: New Sea Shrimp Roe is Sold

New sea shrimp roe, harvested this autumn, has not been seen until recently. Over ten boxes of medium-grade shrimp roe were recently shipped from Weihai. The quality is excellent and they were immediately sold for $150.

### Paper Prices: Native Paper Expensive

Native paper from eastern Zhejiang transported to Shanghai consists mainly of grass paper and screen paper. Grass paper is produced in Fuyang, Tonglu, Quzhou, and the Ningbo-Shaoxing area, while screen paper is produced in Xiaoshan, Shangyu, Zhuji, and Xincang. Their uses are well known. Screen paper is used by people in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, and Shanxi to replace paper for burning, but it can also be used as practice calligraphy paper, so sales are also very strong. Before the Zhejiang coastal blockade on "January 5th," the amount of these two types of native paper transported from Ningbo to Shanghai was very large, so the price increase compared to the second half of last year was still slight. Grass paper sells for two yuan and eighty cents to three yuan and fifty cents per bundle in national currency. High-quality sanitary grass paper sells for six yuan and twenty cents to seven yuan and fifty cents per large bundle (note). Screen paper sells for twelve yuan and fifty cents to fourteen yuan and fifty cents per piece. However, after the Zhejiang coastal blockade, arrivals in Shanghai have almost disappeared, but because sales are still very strong, the stock in the market is gradually being exhausted. In addition, paper merchants hoard and speculate, making it impossible to purchase whole batches from the market for transportation to other areas. Therefore, paper prices are soaring. As of now, coarse grass paper sells for eight yuan and fifty cents to ten yuan and five cents per bundle. High-quality sanitary grass paper has risen even more, to twenty-four yuan to twenty-six yuan per bundle, an increase of one to two and a half times compared to before the blockade. Screen paper sells for twenty-eight yuan to thirty-two yuan per piece, but better quality "Xiaoshan Wang Xiaoji Screen Tip" and "Shangyu Screen," etc., are almost nowhere to be found in the market. Paper merchants mostly use inferior "local mountain eight 'tip'" paper to meet demand. (Note: One large bundle of sanitary grass paper is equivalent to three small bundles of coarse grass paper in terms of quantity). (Yan)

### Overview of Five Major Cultural Undertakings of the Catholic Church in China

(1) Xujiahui Library

Xujiahui in Shanghai is the site of the tomb of Xu Wending, a former Ming dynasty chancellor. Many of his descendants have also lived there for generations. It is also located at the confluence of the Zhaojiabang and Fahuajing rivers, hence the name Xujiahui. Tracing back to the beginning of the Jesuit mission in China, they immediately focused on cultural undertakings. Later, due to suppression, the Jesuit presence in China was interrupted. It was not until the 22nd year of Daoguang (1842) that they returned, preaching in Jiangnan, and cultural undertakings were revived. In the 27th year of Daoguang (1847), Jesuits moved from Hengtang in Qingpu to Xujiahui to establish a permanent residence. The prototype of the library was likely formed at this time, as the Jesuits, focused on culture, inevitably relied on books.

Initially, the library was housed in simple buildings, just three rooms. In the 10th year of Xianfeng (1860), the site was expanded, moving Zhaojiabang to the east and adding a four-story building to serve as a residence for the Jesuits. The library then had its own location. As the collection grew, the original library became insufficient. In the 23rd year of Guangxu (1897), another building was constructed in the eastern corner of the residence, with a total of twelve rooms over two floors. Western books were stored on the upper floor, and Chinese books on the lower floor. (Moved in the 32nd year of Guangxu [1906] and remains so today).

The founder of the library was Father Gotteland, a French priest who arrived in Shanghai in the 22nd year of Daoguang. However, the individuals who truly expanded this library and laid its foundation were Fathers P. Zottoli and P. Havret. Both Chao and Xia were famous sinologists and prolific writers who made significant contributions to bridging Chinese and Western cultures.

However, those who assisted the two fathers in developing this great undertaking were Ma Xiangbo and Li Jianyu, both outstanding students of Father Chao. Ma Xiangbo is well known and needs no further praise, but his library work is little known outside the Church. Li was a native of Nanhui, Jiangsu, born in the 20th year of Daoguang (1840). He founded the Yiwunlu, Huibao, and Shengxinbao, becoming a pioneer in the newspaper industry. He also authored many books on religion and philosophy. He passed away in the first year of the Republic (1912). Those who managed the library under Ma and Li included Shen Jinbiao (1845-1929), Xu Li (1851-1932), Mao Benquan (still living), Xu Yunxi (died in February of this year), Zhang Ruoyu (1869-1929), Zhang Yushan (1872-1929), and Yang Weishi, among others. Since the 12th year of the Republic, both Chinese and Western clergy have been in charge of the Chinese and Western collections. The current head is Father Cui Tingcai, a French priest who has been in China for 47 years and is also a renowned sinologist.

The purpose of the Xujiahui Library is to assist clergy in academic research, and the clergy's academic research aims to promote Chinese culture. Therefore, it does not emphasize empty theories. As a result, its collection prioritizes history and geography. The most valuable historical and geographical books are local gazetteers from various provinces. The Xujiahui Library has acquired 2,531 types of local gazetteers over the years. The provincial breakdown is as follows: Hebei, 264; Liaoning, 64; Jilin, 9; Heilongjiang, 16; Shandong, 253; Gansu, 71; Xinjiang, 13; Henan, 274; Shanxi, 181; Jiangsu, 235; Anhui, 105; Jiangxi, 118; Sichuan, 207; Guangdong, 116; Fujian, 80; Zhejiang, 181; Hubei, 115; Hunan, 89; Shaanxi, 140; Guangxi, 61; Yunnan, 96; Guizhou, 44. Several points should be noted regarding local gazetteers: (1) Over 400 types of general geography, local customs, towns, mountains, rivers, and temple gazetteers are not included in this count. (2) According to a survey of local gazetteers held in libraries nationwide by Mr. Zhu Shijia over a decade ago, the library has 98 unique copies and is particularly rich in late Ming and early Qing printings. However, many rare books have been collected in the last ten years. The most precious is the five-volume manuscript of the Zhishun Zhenjiang Gazetteer. The cover has the inscription "Jiaoshan Han Yin An Book Collection," and inside there are the words "Objects collected by Ruan's Langhuan Mountain Hall." The end of the fifth volume has the words "Dantu Wang Yuyi Ruan Heng Collated Characters," "Yuan Zhao Re-collated Xingfu Temple Attic," "He Yuanxi Corrected Several Places," etc. The cover of the first volume has the three words "Unfinished Draft." Inside, there are densely pasted corrections and typesetting formats, which are likely the draft of the Zhishun Zhenjiang Gazetteer. Ruan Heng, courtesy name Meishu, was the first on the secondary list in the 23rd year of Jiaqing. (3) Genealogies can supplement the inadequacies of local gazetteers. The library has also recently acquired about 200 genealogies. In addition to local gazetteers and genealogies, the library also houses Buddhist scriptures and Daoist canons, such as the major collections of scriptures from the Japanese Hongkyo Shoin, the Japanese Sutra Repository, and the Taisho Shinshu Daizokyo, as well as Buddhist texts printed in China. The library also values series. The "First Collection of Heavenly Learning," the only Catholic series in China, also contains all the writings of Western scholars from the late Ming and Qing dynasties, with over 100 types, including printed editions, manuscripts, and photocopies, making it one of the richest collections in the world. Newspapers and magazines are also related to history, so the library tries to preserve complete sets. For example, Shenbao's first issue to this day is a complete set. Even important historical materials of the Kuomintang are preserved in part. Other ordinary books and series are difficult to list. Catholic books are also the most collected in the country. In the future, with some reorganization, a Catholic scripture collection can be compiled and printed.

### International Cup Football Tournament, China Encounters England

Curtain to Rise on December 14

The International Cup football tournament will open on December 14. The order for the first week includes a total of three clashes. China meets England. Although China's lineup this year has lost Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting, it is still very strong. England, however, has weakened due to the withdrawal of Cambodia, so China is expected to steadily secure a spot in the semi-finals. The other two games are the World Team vs. Portugal and the Russian Team vs. the Jewish Team. The French team is idle. The World Team is organized by Saint Francis's famous striker Fuen and others. The Russian team has many famous players scattered among various A-League teams, such as Beixitong's Tievoni, Cairo, Nogulov, Saint Francis's Sicalo Lequ, the French firm's Robert Stov, Lax's Kapustin, and Xibu's Zhuolun Zefu, all of whom are the best of their time.

### Paramount vs. Xiqing Giant: Basketball Friendly Match Yesterday, 48-43, Giant Wins Narrowly

However, neither team fielded their true starting lineups, and the game was played very politely. Mr. Bratov, the Xiqing Sports Director, also provided instructions throughout. Li Zhenzhong, the main player for Paramount, did not play yesterday. The Giants had the advantage of playing on their home court. Therefore, the Giants led 26-20 in the first half by six points. In the second half, Paramount made a slight counterattack and led 23-22. The final result was a narrow victory for the Giants, 48-43.

Short Essay

### The Story of the Parrot

— Xu Yi

"Ah Wang is stealing flowers, Ah Wang is stealing flowers!" The crisp sound came from the courtyard into the room.

The owner of the room ran out of the doorway and looked into the courtyard. Ah Wang was indeed hiding in the flower bushes, making faces.

"What a clever bird," the owner praised, looking at the parrot hanging under the courtyard pillar.

××××

"Ah Wang is stealing flowers, Ah Wang is stealing flowers!" The crisp sound came from the courtyard into the room.

The owner of the room ran out of the door and looked into the courtyard. Ah Wang was not hiding in the flower bushes, but was cooking in the kitchen.

"What a cunning bird, falsely accusing people," the owner said with a faint smile, looking at the parrot hanging under the courtyard pillar.

××××

"Ah Wang is stealing flowers, Ah Wang is stealing flowers!" It was the same old tune.

The owner of the room ran out of the door and looked into the courtyard. There was no Ah Wang, nor were there any flowers. The flowers had already withered, and Ah Wang had long since stopped its business.

"..." The owner said nothing; he felt bored.

××××

"Ah Wang is stealing flowers, Ah Wang is stealing flowers!" Again the old tune.

The owner of the room became angry because it had awakened him from his afternoon nap.

"××," the owner called to his child, "Take the parrot out and feed it to the cat. It's such an annoying bird!"

### Frozen Corpses on the Road

— Zhang Hong

Friends! Don't cover your noses. I guarantee there won't be a single trace of odor.

Why don't you let go? Don't you believe me? Well, let me tell you.

Just last night, only nine hours ago, isn't that short? The time it takes you to play twenty rounds of mahjong. He, or rather it should be "she," still had blood, still had breath, the heart was still beating. If you still don't believe me, ask the shop assistants at the cigarette shop; they all saw it.

You should remember that the north wind was very strong last night. When you walked out of the heated dance hall and got into your car, you probably shivered.

Right at the entrance of this sauce shop, yes! It's right by that stone boundary marker, you guessed it perfectly. He was squatting there.

His eyes seemed to be covered with a film, looking like a layer of white membrane from a distance. Thick yellow mucus drooped down to his mouth, almost flowing over his lips; if he weren't still trembling, who would dare say this was a living person?

Of course! If it were you, you would have turned your head, closed your eyes, covered your nose with a fragrant handkerchief, and that would be it! But, you haven't forgotten my incorrigible habit of curiosity, have you? I completely forgot that I had something else to do and just...

I watched quietly, he trembled quietly, for almost ten minutes.

Probably, in addition to the cold, he suddenly thought of hunger! He stretched out such a frightening hand, a hand that even I found hard to believe: you? Don't even mention seeing it; you probably haven't even thought of it. Ah! You compare it to the slender waists of women, good! A wonderful comparison! But, friend, would you be willing to take your hand out of your coat pocket and embrace it?

Right; let's continue! Feeling around, he found a small tin can and then felt a pair of chopsticks inside the can. Of course, his expression wasn't as leisurely as you gentlemen eating fancy meals; however, at that moment, the joy he got from the food wasn't something you could enjoy.

This joy didn't last long. His eyes, devoid of awareness, and the hand, as slender as a woman's waist, found almost nothing in the can. One chopstick was inside the can, the other was outside, trying to scoop something up. The consequences need no explanation. With a more violent tremor, the tin can rolled to the edge of the sidewalk. Perhaps this was the only time in his life he was separated from the tin can, which was like his only life.

Even he could understand that he probably wouldn't make it through tonight. I thought I could wait and watch him roll over like the tin can, but I failed! I waited until 8:30, and he was still squatting there, trembling. Disappointed, I had to give up my curiosity.

When exactly did he give up on his life? That's hard to say. Oh yes! Who would calculate the time and write an obituary for him? In short, it was at most nine hours, and there definitely wouldn't be any odor, I guarantee it. Now, I think you can put down your handkerchief.

We guarded for more than five hours, and there was no activity in that number seventeen house, and no one went in or out. It wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that we saw the old man come out, and I followed him. Hesheng stayed there."

"The old man hired a rickshaw and went straight to the Yuanchang Jewelry Shop on Baoxing Road and went inside. I waited outside for a long time—almost half an hour. At this time, there were two people loitering in front of the jewelry shop, one wearing a gray thin flannel robe and the other wearing a gaudy Western suit. I didn't know what the purpose of these two people was. After a while, the old man came out of the jewelry store. The two people outside pretended to walk away. The old man didn't take the rickshaw anymore and walked east. He seemed to be looking for something, asking the passersby several times. I followed the old man and looked back, seeing that the two suspicious people were still following him from a distance. Although I suspected the actions of these two people, I couldn't interfere with them."

"The old man walked to a small alley near the intersection of Baoxing Road and suddenly flashed into it. I hurried forward and saw him taking out a small white package and throwing it into the trash can at the entrance of the alley. I hurriedly avoided it, letting the old man come out of the alley again. After he left the alley, I also quickly flashed into the alley, picked up the small package from the trash can, opened it, and saw that it was a knife wrapped in a white handkerchief."

Sang suddenly leaned up and raised his right hand. "Brother Jinshou, has the knife been handed over to you? Can you let me take a look?"

Ni Jinshou responded, "Yes, I was just about to tell you that the knife Song Quan brought back could match Li Zhifan's ideal for committing the crime. But I was a bit confused at the time." As he spoke, he opened the drawer in front of him and handed the white-wrapped package to Hawthorne.

Hawthorne unfolded the white handkerchief, revealing a cheap, pointed fruit knife inside. I saw that the blade of the knife was about four or five inches long, and the handle was made of wood and was somewhat oval in shape. This knife could be bought anywhere for only a few cents. I looked at the blade of the knife and didn't see any bloodstains, but there were many bloodstains on the white handkerchief that wrapped it, and there was also a lot of mud on the handkerchief.

### Tears

— Pinpin

I once read a story about a princess who was blind. A prince who was engaged to her since childhood discovered this defect and asked a sorcerer to cure her. The sorcerer told the prince to say the most loving words to her. The princess was heartbroken and shed tears, and her eyes regained their sight. Tears are precious; they can bring happiness after a long period of pain and heat.

Your family is ruined, your property is lost, you should shed tears; but remember: who gave you the misfortune and loss? You should grit your teeth, ignite a fire of anger, and demand compensation from him. Holding grudges alone and just waiting will not do! Not the crying of a daughter, but the tears of a hero, do you understand!

Our tears are not shed in vain. We must let our tears awaken our hatred and use iron-winged strength to regain our glory and happiness. If you have tears, shed them now, brave and combative people!

Tears also have a value: they are a symbol of awakening.

Dear friend, have you shed tears because of pain? If you have, heaven will bless you, and you will soon gain happiness.

Crying all day long is, of course, harmful and ridiculous. When shedding tears, don't sigh. Only cowards sigh. So what should you do? You should shed tears when you should, and clench your teeth and fists at the same time.

The French poet Lamartine said: "A person is like a tree, shaking it to make it drop its fruit. If it doesn't shed tears, that person will never be touched." We are here, how you are you know, you will feel hatred and shed a few tears involuntarily; like glittering tears indicate you have a clear heart. Under the lair of sin, those who are numb and are not a bit moved to the point of tearing, actually instead burst out of the dirty smile, this person must be comatose! There are so many comatose people that it is frightening! Friends, quickly hate these dreaming corpses with absurd smiles! We are living the life of slaves, only grief and anger, suddenly wake up!

Tears are the blood of the soul, as worthy of cherishing as the blood of the body.

### Fantasy

— Gongli

Fantasy is a stimulant. It can make people successful, it can make people happy, but it can also make people crazy. So you should remember: "We must be the masters of fantasy, never the slaves of fantasy!"

### Garbo's Romantic Interests

— Sha Wei

Five times unsuccessful in marriage, still considering her passionate relationship with Heshell.

Since Greta Garbo and Gayelord Hauser returned from their trip to Mount Mist, their romance has been the topic of conversation among every Hollywood gossip. The first phone call she received in the MGM dressing room was from Hauser; at the same time, Garbo, exceptionally, allowed Hauser to freely enter and exit the set while she was working, which shows how intense the relationship between the two has become. By the time this article is published, perhaps Garbo, known for her mystery, has become Mrs. Hauser, but this matter is always a bit doubtful; will Garbo really marry him?

Here, let's recall Garbo's history of romance. She has had five romances, but none of them have resulted in marriage. The first was the famous director Mauritz Stiller, who brought her into the film industry; the second was her on-screen lover John Gilbert; in 1934, George Brent became her third lover; in 1937, Garbo and the great musician Leopold Stokowski also developed a close friendship; so Hauser is her fifth romantic interest.

Now, a big question arises: will Hauser be victorious? The others have all had deep contact with Garbo, and there has been love between her and them, but the second step of marriage has never been carried out. Why is this? The main reason is clearly that Garbo has developed a fear of marriage. In the two steps of romance and union, she has only chosen the former and abandoned union. So, if we want to predict the outcome of this romance, if she still holds on to her fear, then she will not only not marry him, but she may never marry anyone.

Garbo's periods of romance with them can be said to be very short, and this is not because Garbo is fickle, but because she is too cautious: she is suspicious of every ordinary person, and she only trusts the few close friends she usually comes into contact with.

From this point of view, Garbo is really lacking in natural ability, that is, she is congenitally deficient. In her constitution, rest and quiet have become absolute necessities. When she is in love, her love is extremely single-minded. Like other women, she fulfills this obligation of love and naturally hopes for reward, which is not only simple love, but also a large amount of "strength" to help her own lack; she often hesitates about the amount of "strength" on the other side, and also clearly understands that this "hesitation" will hinder her own happiness, therefore she eliminates it.

Unfortunately, Garbo's congenital deficiency makes her fearful of everyone. Although she has love, she does not fully reveal it; Garbo believes that "marriage" is a sacred and unavoidable major event, and her character is always high and lonely, so the results of several romances have all become bubbles. She feels that it is more meaningful to dedicate her body and mind entirely to her career.

We can conclude that if Garbo marries, then her partner must meet her ideal standards, so whether she will be Mrs. Hauser in the future is still a question.

### Talking about Dialect Drama

— Fisherman

These days, dialect drama is being discussed very enthusiastically in the theater world. In fact, this is not a new invention today. Before August 13th, plays using Shanghai dialect were often performed in factories or schools. The application of dialect drama is often suitable for specific areas, such as performing worker plays in factories in Pudong. The audience is mostly from Pudong. Performing plays in Mandarin sometimes makes it difficult for them to understand; while performing in Pudong dialect can make them accept it. After the outbreak of the war, "going to the countryside to perform plays" attracted the attention of artists, and most of the rural plays were performed using local dialects. Those mobile performance troupes also trained villagers everywhere to perform dialect dramas themselves. These actions were nothing more than to achieve the goals of propaganda and education more urgently. However, dialect dramas are rarely performed in formal theaters. This time, the Huaguang Theater first performed "Twilight" (a persecuted adaptation) in Shanghai dialect at the Xuan Palace, and the Shanghai Drama Art Society's "Under the Shanghai Roof" was the earliest to perform multi-act dramas in Shanghai dialect. This is still an attempt. It is said that the Drama Art Society invited a dialect drama expert to rewrite all the lines of "Under the Shanghai Eaves" into Shanghai dialect in advance, and also invited many actors who were good at speaking Shanghai dialect to participate in the performance. The content of this play originally pierced through Shanghai life, and now performing it in Shanghai dialect will definitely make people feel more cordial.
