### Broadcast by Chairman Chiang to the United States

China and the United States jointly maintain justice, defend peace, and resist aggression to the end, as China's due responsibility. Increased US aid to China is now beyond further delay.

Chongqing - The National Broadcasting Company of the United States earnestly requested Chairman Chiang to broadcast to the United States on the third anniversary of China's War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Chairman Chiang acceded to this request, and at 6:15 AM on the 8th, delivered a speech to the United States via international radio. It was immediately translated into English by Madame Chiang and rebroadcast across the United States by the National Broadcasting Company of the United States. This was precisely at 6:45 PM on the 7th in the United States, coinciding with the end of the workday for most Americans, thus ensuring a large audience, estimated at over twenty million. Subsequently, a telegram from Manila reported that the broadcast was received with excellent clarity.

Chairman Chiang stated that to the esteemed people of the United States, your country's radio station has requested me to speak to your people via broadcast today. On this significant anniversary marking the beginning of the fourth year of China's War of Resistance, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak with American friends and feel it is particularly meaningful. Our two countries, China and the United States, are not only friendly nations separated by water with close ties, but also allies with the same aspirations and equal responsibilities in upholding justice, defending peace in the Far East, and protecting human civilization. The American people understand the significance of China's War of Resistance most clearly. The sympathy and assistance that the United States has shown to China's War of Resistance are not only appreciated by all Chinese military and civilians, but also inspire them. China's War of Resistance has been going on for three years. I do not need to elaborate on the situation of our war. Our war is arduous, but it is also steadfast and sustained. Due to our steadfast resistance, Japan's military strength has been greatly depleted, as you all know. Three years ago, when China rose up to resist aggression, we decided not only to use our full strength to defend our national survival, but also to defend international integrity, human justice, and peace in the Far East and the world. The goodwill of the American government and people in assisting us in various ways is seen by me and the Chinese military and civilians as best repaid by resolutely resisting aggression to the end. Our obligations and goals will not be achieved unless we resist to the end. We believe that China should resist aggression regardless of all sacrifices, which is China's national obligation to its ancestors, as well as an obligation to the overall situation in the Far East and world peace. We feel that the sympathy of the world's friendly nations for us is not out of favoritism towards China, but to jointly fulfill their responsibility to maintain humanity and justice and eliminate aggression. In today's world of drastic changes, we in China feel even more strongly the importance of the value of our past resistance and the enormity of our future responsibilities. I dare to assure you that China will definitely fulfill this responsibility, and at the same time, I hope that friendly nations will promptly fulfill their due responsibilities. I firmly believe that my request to the American people to jointly sanction Japan is not at all presumptuous and will definitely receive an effective response. I personally have two feelings regarding the attitude of the American government and public since the September 18th Incident. The first point is that America's attitude against Japanese aggression has remained consistent. The second point is that I feel that the United States is prudent and deliberate before taking action, but once it decides to act, it is very resolute and unambiguous. As President Roosevelt said, "Peace cannot be achieved by hope and empty words alone." From this sentence, I see that "America's prudence is America's resolution." But now is the time for the United States to take necessary steps. In order to implement America's consistent anti-aggression policy and to curb the source of fire in the Pacific as soon as possible, I believe that increasing aid to China is now beyond further delay. The American people should not only be the backing for American national policy but also actively promote the realization of American national policy. In 1937, I once said, "Once the power of justice and righteousness is unleashed, it will surely achieve its purpose." Today, in my position as the commander-in-chief of China's War of Resistance, I reiterate these words to American friends. (8th Dispatch)

US Presidential Secretary's Article on Chinese Affairs Causes Disappointment

Chongqing - A recent article by Roosevelt's private secretary, Mr. O'Leary, put forward suggestions regarding the Monroe Doctrine for the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Political circles here have not yet had time to study and comment on it. However, upon receiving this news, all sectors of the Chinese community unanimously expressed deep disappointment. Their first reaction was that the United States is now adopting a policy of "transformation" and abandoning its position as a leader and supporter of international justice and pacifism. The Chinese are particularly disappointed because Chairman Chiang had just appealed to the United States to adopt a more active policy and provide assistance to China. According to O'Leary's article, President Roosevelt believes that countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas should unite within their respective regions to resolve land ownership issues themselves, rather than being decided by an aggressive power. The US government hopes to see and believes that Europe and Asia should implement the Monroe Doctrine, consistent with the interpretation and implementation of this doctrine in the Western Hemisphere.

### Japanese Casualties in Three Years Reach 1.6 Million - Report by He Yingqin and Others - Over 800 Japanese Aircraft Shot Down - Chinese Military Equipment Greatly Strengthened

Chongqing - Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, in a detailed review of the major battles in the Sino-Japanese War over the past three years, stated that as of May of this year, the total number of Japanese casualties had reached 1.6 million. 83% of Japanese able-bodied men have already been conscripted into the army. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese mobilized 25 divisions, later increasing to 29, and now reaching 33. At the beginning of the war, China had 2 million soldiers, but this has now increased to 5 million, with millions more currently in training. As of May of this year, the Chinese army has captured a total of 760 field guns, 3,300 machine guns, and 69,000 rifles. As of February of this year, 12 provinces have seen fighting: Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangdong. In addition, parts of the three provinces of Hunan, Fujian, and Guangxi have also seen conflict. Among the aforementioned provinces, the Japanese army occupies 8 cities and 532 counties, with only 58 counties being fully occupied. In the remaining 474 counties, the Japanese army can only occupy the land within the city walls, while the area outside the city remains under the control of the Chinese army. Minister He believes that the Japanese battle lines are too long, stretching from the Mongolian desert in the north to the South China Sea in the south, which is far beyond the capacity of the Japanese military. The current favorable situation on various front lines is due to this reason. In addition, according to Bai Chongxi, Chief of Military Training of the Military Affairs Commission, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out three years ago, the total number of Chinese troops, including provincial armies, was less than 200 divisions. However, the number has greatly increased, and today, the number of mobile troops alone exceeds 1 million. China currently has 4 million reserve soldiers, with over 50 million men of military age, of whom 30 million have received preliminary training. In view of the need for officers, many new schools have been established, including one each for military transport, military supply, mechanized units, cavalry, and infantry schools, as well as eight branch schools of the Central Military Academy and two training organizations for guerrilla members. 10,000 graduates have been assigned to various war zones.

The anti-aircraft guns did not fire, allowing the Chinese fighter planes to intercept the Japanese aircraft each time they appeared over Chongqing. When the fourth group flew over the city, the air battle was particularly fierce. Several Japanese aircraft were seen to disperse from the main group and were still being fiercely attacked by Chinese fighter planes. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

### Britain Declines Japanese Request to Restrict Military Transport on the Burma Road, Arita Expresses Deep Regret, Asks Britain to Reconsider

Tokyo - British Ambassador Craig today informed Japanese Foreign Minister Arita of the British government's reply to Japan's request to stop military supplies from being transported to Chongqing via Burma and Hong Kong. According to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Arita expressed deep regret over this reply and asked the British government to reconsider the matter. In its reply, regarding the issue of transporting war materiel via Hong Kong, the British government stated that the Hong Kong government has already strictly prohibited this export, so the British government believes that this matter has complied with Japan's request. As for the issue of prohibiting the transport of military supplies via Burma, the British government has considered it. However, since these goods include Burmese and Indian goods, it is naturally very difficult to prohibit legitimate trade. In addition, a review of last year's records shows that the rainy season began at the end of June, so until September, the amount of goods transported via Burma was even less than one-tenth of the normal amount. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo - A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that the fact that Japan did not simultaneously request the Soviet Union to close its route to Chongqing when requesting Britain to close the Burma Road was not intended to deliberately embarrass Britain. However, when the Japanese government will protest to the Soviet Union about supplying military supplies to Chongqing and how to protest, cannot be said at this time. The spokesman also said that at a time when Japan has not yet negotiated this issue with the Soviet Union, the Japanese government hopes that all countries will cooperate with Japan to stop trade with China, so that the Sino-Japanese War can end as soon as possible and meet the hopes of Japan and other countries. (8th Associated Press Dispatch)

Tokyo - British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, presented to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita this afternoon a reply to Japan's protest regarding Hong Kong and Burma supplying China with military supplies. After reading the reply, Arita immediately requested the British government to reconsider the issue and expressed that the Japanese government was not satisfied with the British reply.

### Industrial Cooperative Exhibition Opens in Chongqing

Chongqing - Although Chongqing is under Japanese air raids, the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement Exhibition still opened as usual this year at the Jialing Apartments. The items on display at the exhibition site are sufficient to prove the excellent results of various industrial products made in China. It is found that the Chinese Industrial Cooperative has established thousands of small industrial units across the country in the recent two years, and their monthly output value reaches a huge amount of five million yuan. The items displayed in this exhibition include various cotton, silk, wool, and linen textiles and leather products. In addition, there are various machines and machine tools, which are even more significant because this kind of output is of great benefit to the widespread development of industry in the Chinese interior. Not only that, but the exhibition also displays alcohol, chemicals, canned medicines, and pottery, further proving the remarkable effectiveness of the industrial cooperative movement.

Editorial

### The Monroe Doctrine Expounded by the US President

The international situation is rapidly evolving in various directions, undergoing qualitative and structural transformations. Let alone how this evolution will end, which is something that the most powerful forces cannot grasp at present; even the current situation is beyond the expectations of the forces that created it.

If we allow the situation to transform as much as possible, allowing it to evolve naturally, then apart from lamenting and questioning where it will all end, there is no way to foresee its future or predict its ultimate outcome. What we can foresee is that each side will do its best to continue fighting; after the war, the victors will continue their posture as rulers, the vanquished will struggle furtively, and those fortunate enough to be outside the vortex will also be uneasy. Thus, the three will each do their best to compete in armaments and prepare for another war. Competing for strength and victory, seeking control and plotting revenge, it is clear that there will never be stability, let alone an ultimate outcome. Did not Emperor Napoleon have the wisdom to accept the historical lessons of more than 1,700 years, yet he was ultimately exiled? From the "Holy Alliance" of Russia, Prussia, and Austria to its transformation into the Quadruple Alliance of Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Britain, using absolute authority to dominate Europe, it eventually disintegrated. The Treaty of Versailles ended the last European war, but ignited this one, turning everything to ashes. Back then, who did not want to create an immutable situation? Those who hoped for it to remain unchanged still saw it changing endlessly, let alone now when it is rapidly advancing towards drastic changes!

The United States, being on the sidelines, probably does not want to sit idly by and watch the international situation evolve in a chaotic manner! Is this not the motive behind President Roosevelt's recent authorization to Secretary O'Leary to re-expound the Monroe Doctrine? This exposition involves both Europe and Asia and is aimed at the current evolution. Its main points are roughly as follows: "If Germany demands all the territories of France, Britain, and the Netherlands in the Western Hemisphere, the United States does not intend to make efforts to take over these territories, but will invite the American countries to decide whether to place these territories under a trusteeship system until they can be returned to their original owners." The original Monroe Doctrine of the United States was issued in 1823; at that time, the European "Holy Alliance" wanted to exert its monarchical and divine power to interfere in the many newly independent and free countries in the Americas; therefore, US President Monroe issued this declaration, opposing European countries controlling the fate of these new American countries with various pretexts or methods. Therefore, what Roosevelt ordered to be expounded this time is still the original intention of that time, but it is not only that; it involves Europe and Asia, and makes suggestions that are almost proactive and constructive for this extremely turbulent and changing situation. Therefore, it is also said: "The President stated that the United States has no intention of interfering with land issues related to adjustments in Europe or Asia. What the US government wants to see and believes should exist is the implementation of the Monroe Doctrine in Europe and Asia, consistent with the interpretation and implementation of this doctrine in the Western Hemisphere. For example, regarding the issue of French Indochina, the United States believes that all countries in Asia should consult and reach a decision. Disputes in Europe and Asia should be resolved by the countries in Europe and Asia themselves. The disposition and management of the islands and other territories conquered by Germany within the Western Hemisphere should be resolved by the American countries."

Regarding this declaration with profound significance, we deeply regret not knowing it in more detail and more concretely. Even based on the above quotation, we certainly do not want to intentionally misunderstand or maliciously distort it, and hope that the telegram transmission is accurate. Then, we cannot but interpret it as the following points:

(1) The issue of European countries' territories in the Americas must be discussed by the American countries, that is, it is not convenient to let the victor decide it;

(2) It recognizes that the territories of the warring countries in Europe and Asia have room for change;

(3) The territorial changes in Europe and Asia must be discussed by all the countries in each continent. It is not convenient to let the victor decide it;

(4) Matters involving more than one continent must be decided by all the countries in the relevant continents;

(5) The so-called Monroe Doctrine in Europe and the so-called Monroe Doctrine in Asia may not be recognized, but they must be like the original face of the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas; that is, respect the independence and freedom of each continent and each country, and not allow other countries to control their fate.

Regarding these, we do not want to elaborate, but hope that the interpretation is not erroneous.

### Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Issues Letter to the Youth of the Nation, Explaining the True Meaning of the Three Principles of the People, and Encouraging Youth Not to Despair

The current urgent tasks for youth: 1. Understand the era; 2. Uphold ideological beliefs; 3. Establish a revolutionary outlook on life.

Chongqing. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, Chief Chiang issued a letter to the youth of the nation, stating in brief:

Our nation's war of resistance has exceeded three years. In the past, I, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to gather the new forces of the Chinese national revolution and ensure the success of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, specially created the Three Principles of the People Youth League. Since its establishment to the present, it has been two years. Our national youth, in difficult and arduous environments, have done their best, worked hard, tried their best to provide relief to compatriots in distress, provided voluntary care for wounded officers and soldiers, been loyal to the Party and the country, served society, and studied to strengthen themselves. All have experienced extraordinary forging and tempering, and their development and growth, compared with the past, has achieved substantial progress. However,

reviewing the past and considering the current situation, the efforts that the country and the nation require of our youth are increasing day by day, and the daily diligence and efforts of our youth to improve themselves and serve the country are still insufficient. In the progress of the work of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, they have not been able to exert their full strength and fulfill their duties. There are even those who cannot overcome the difficulties of the environment, and thus hesitate and feel depressed, leading to pessimism and depression. The impact of this on the future of the nation and the success or failure of the revolution is immense. Today,

all the youth of the nation are the successors of our nation's great culture and the creators of our country's bright future. The heavy responsibility of revolutionary nation-building rests on the shoulders of our youth. Therefore, I, Chiang Kai-shek, truly believe that all careers and all responsibilities are entrusted to our youth to complete the new life of succession. My expectations for our youth are like those of family members for their children. Now, as the War of Resistance has exceeded three years and the second anniversary of the founding of our Youth League is approaching, and at this important juncture of the country's final victory, I must sincerely and earnestly inform all the youth of the nation about the

basic understanding and genuine efforts that youth should have at present. The reason why life is valuable lies in having foresight for the future, willpower for action, and ideals for life. This is the characteristic of mankind, and especially so in youth. What kind of era do we live in? In this era, what will we do, what will we show, what will we achieve in order to satisfy our own aspirations and achieve an ideal life? This is the common feeling and necessary understanding of any young person. The success or failure of a young person depends on how they perceive it, and then

correctly and firmly adhere to this understanding of an ideal life, then their heart will be at peace and their spirit will be strong, and they will surely move forward directly. If they are uncertain of this understanding or only have knowledge but it is not correct or firm, then hesitation and depression are inevitable results. Why do young people today have the phenomenon of hesitation and depression? It is because they have failed to truly understand their era and environment, and therefore have failed to properly consider their responsibilities and future. What I believe to be a proper consideration is, first of all, to recognize the country in which we are born and the relationship between the individual and the country. Living in China today, it is necessary to first seek

national independence and national liberation, and only then can there be talk of a truly ideal life for the individual. How to achieve national independence and national liberation? This is the question of how the national revolution can succeed. The success or failure of the national revolution depends on whether its revolutionary ideology is realized. If this ideology is great, correct, and complete, and suitable for the revolutionary environment, then the ideology will surely be realized and the revolution will surely succeed. If this ideology is not suitable for the era and environment of the Chinese revolution, then it will definitely not be realized. If the ideology fails, the revolution will inevitably fail. Therefore, if the youth of today truly wish to realize their ideal life, they only need to

understand the era and national environment, understand revolutionary ideology, determine revolutionary thought, recognize the path, and devote all their efforts. Then all depression can be broken, the meaning of life will be clear and unwavering, and there will be no pain of hesitation and confusion. From the above, it can be seen that if our youth want to break through psychological hesitation and depression, and earnestly shoulder the mission of history and the era, the most urgent tasks are no more than (1) understanding the era, (2) upholding ideological beliefs, and (3) establishing a revolutionary outlook on life. Speaking of the current era in China, since the outbreak of our sacred War of Resistance, we have reached the critical juncture of the survival and continuation of our Chinese nation's five thousand years of historical culture. It is also the pivot for our descendants of the Yellow Emperor to be reborn and

turn weakness into strength to open up an infinitely bright future. The Japanese, with their army, navy, and air force accumulated over forty years, are making a desperate gamble against China. And we, with inferior military equipment, have fought hard for three years and stood firm. Moreover, the foundation of our country's victory is becoming increasingly solid. This kind of arduous and extraordinary battle, and the resulting

major achievements, such as the reform of politics and economy, the promotion of social culture, and the transformation of the era and environment, are not only unprecedented in Chinese history, but also open a new era in world history. From the observation of people from third countries, or the descendants of future generations looking back at this earth-shattering history, they will truly not know how to admire the glory and greatness of our Chinese nation at this stage. How fortunate are our youth to be born in this greatest period in history? They must never fail to live up to this

once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity. If they can develop their revolutionary spirit and use it in the struggle for revolutionary national salvation, then their career achievements will be unprecedented. The independence of the country and the liberation of the nation must be obtained with our blood and sweat. From this, we can create our true life, and also open up infinite life for the youth who come after us. Born in this era and serving this national destiny, we must never despair and give up on ourselves, but should seize the era and shoulder the responsibility of carrying on the past and opening up the future for the nation. Everyone should contribute their intelligence, work hard at their duties, give full play to the glory of their lives, and fulfill their revolutionary responsibilities and obligations. This is why we

actively improve ourselves and eliminate hesitation and depression. The first key is to talk about steadfast ideological beliefs. The most important ideologies advocated by various countries in the world today are nothing more than Fascism, Communism, and Democracy. The so-called democracy is a product of capitalist countries. Over the years, the environment has changed, and it is definitely not as thorough as the Principle of Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People, and it cannot solve the issue of civil rights truly and completely. Communism focuses on the economy, and its theory is based on the interests of one class, and it cannot provide a perfect and rational solution to the entire issue of people's livelihood. As for Fascism, it only focuses on the interests of its own nation and ignores the interests of other nations, and it is even less comparable to our ideal and progressive nationalism. All of these are biased and incomplete, and each has its shortcomings. Only the

Three Principles of the People created by our Premier are different. It starts from the most sincere and acts with the utmost impartiality, with the philosophy of people's livelihood, universal love, and helping the masses as its principle, and world harmony, mutual assistance, and shared enjoyment as its goal. Its content is complete, concrete, and feasible, and it is sufficient to solve the three major problems of nation, civil rights, and people's livelihood in the world today, without any bias, incompleteness, or inversion of priorities. The Premier's key to practicing nationalism is: (Nationalism must be practiced first, and then one is qualified to talk about cosmopolitanism). His key to developing the Principle of Livelihood is: (Everyone should aim to serve, not to seize). It can be seen that my Three Principles of the People, compared with Western countries that use private capital (possessive desire) to stimulate production, or with the methods of (historical materialism) and (social revolution), truly have

a world of difference. Moreover, the Three Principles of the People is based on reason, emotion, and law, so it can make the most appropriate adjustments to human survival and evolution. Moreover, from the perspective of the foundation of the establishment of various ideologies, the philosophical foundation of Western countries inevitably focuses on nouns and things. Only the philosophy of people's livelihood in our Three Principles of the People can combine the spiritual and the material. As for revolutionary power, it emphasizes the development of spiritual power even more. The Premier once said: (Revolutionary power is 90% spirit and 10% material). Because we have this consistent

revolutionary philosophy as a foundation, although the materials on which the revolution depends are lacking, the more the revolutionary spirit is developed, the more it can last. Looking at the changes in the world situation during our three years of War of Resistance, it is truly amazing and unpredictable. A few countries in Europe are no longer able to exist as freely as in the past, or they are destroyed in just a few months, or even defeated in a few days. The reason for this is that there is no most appropriate ideology to be commonly believed and practiced as a foundation for establishing a career, thus causing spiritual turmoil and disappearance. And the reason why our country can fight more and more firmly and stand firm today, in addition to our vast land and people, is actually due to the greatness of the Three Principles of the People, so that every Chinese youth can

truly recognize that only the Three Principles of the People is most suitable for the revolutionary environment of China, everyone firmly believes in the Three Principles of the People, earnestly follows it as the guideline for revolutionary action, with one heart and one mind, seeking to implement it thoroughly, then the Chinese revolution will definitely not fail, even if there is a temporary advance or retreat or setback, and the ideological beliefs are universally and deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people, the national revolution will eventually have a day of success. Related to upholding ideological beliefs is the establishment of a revolutionary outlook on life. To put it plainly, it is to recognize the true meaning of life. Why are we born? Having been born in the current era and world, what kind of responsibilities do we have to the country, the nation, and the world and mankind? Why do we need to make a revolution? How should we work hard to succeed?

The revolutionary cause. In short, what kind of people should we aspire to be in order to be worthy of our ancestors and parents and of future generations? This is what I call a truly ideal life, which can guide us to the greatest success. The establishment of a revolutionary outlook on life is nothing more than recognizing the position of the individual in the universe and the distinction between the relationship between the group and the individual. In terms of the individual's view of the universe, Chiang Kai-shek once said that the universe is a structure of infinitely large space and infinitely long time, while our individual life is as small as a grain of millet in the vast sea and as short as the appearance of a night-blooming cereus. However, the infinitely large space is our stage, and the infinitely long time is our journey.

All things in the universe are born for us and wait for us to use them. "Therefore, we are the masters of the universe. We must conquer nature and use all things to increase human life. In terms of the relationship between the group and the individual, Chiang Kai-shek also said that the purpose of life is to improve the life of all mankind, and the meaning of life is to create a life that continues the universe. From the previous, our youth must exercise their physique and increase their intelligence to achieve our goal of conquering nature and using all things. From the latter meaning, our youth must also break through the individual

life and death barrier and eliminate the selfish mentality of self-interest. Knowing that the youth of China today are born for the independence and freedom of the country and the nation, and for the survival and happiness of all compatriots. Their death must also be for the independence and freedom of the country and the nation, and for the survival and happiness of all compatriots. If they can understand the true meaning of life, then strive towards this, fight forward, create and advance, and there is no reason to hesitate and be depressed. Our youth's clear understanding of the era, ideology, and life is still not enough. If we do not pay attention to the way of practicing and implementing them thoroughly in order to realize the ideals of life and our revolutionary ideology, then all problems will still not be solved. In this way, even if there is an understanding, it is not thorough, and there will still be no follow-up in practice. Today,

most young people have ultimately failed to fully develop their full and abundant life force to make the contributions they should make, and thus have failed to transcend the state of hesitation and depression. This is because they have a considerable understanding of the revolutionary ideological theories and the characteristics of the era, but lack the sincerity and courage to practice them diligently, do not know the path of practice, and lack the spirit of solid practice. They only know how to talk and cannot put it into action, which has led to the phenomenon of emptiness, superficiality, hesitation, and stagnation today, which is not only criticized by society, but also a loss to the revolution. In the future, what young people should unanimously awaken and seek to extricate themselves from is how to put their confirmed ideology into practice in order to complete their ideal life. This requires

the spirit of independence and self-reliance, and the ability to struggle and create. They must not be content with ease and comfort, and willingly become backward elements who sit idly by and rely on the efforts of others. They must not follow the world and float and sink with the vulgar, and have no truly established views on reality, but are merely incited by superficial and shallow propaganda, so as to trap themselves in confusion, disorder, and depression and hesitation. In this rare era and with the profound and broad Three Principles of the People, if our youth can firmly believe in it and practice it diligently, how can they not have the opportunity to practice their ideology, serve the country, and save the world? However, if our youth cannot maintain the spirit of self-respect and independence, or because they cannot endure the economic and living hardships, they will

blame heaven and earth, and harbor all kinds of resentment and prejudice towards the environment, or be tempted by superficial and erroneous propaganda, and waver in their will and change their original intentions. Once the spirit loses what it relies on, then action will inevitably fall into obsession. The ancient sages of China taught people with (extensive study), (careful questioning), (prudent thinking), (clear discrimination), and (diligent practice). The main idea is that everyone can work hard to reflect on themselves, expect a lot from themselves, blame themselves severely, and constantly work hard to complete their sound personality. The key to the success or failure of our youth's life and career lies in this. Whether we can become

great people who stand tall between heaven and earth also lies in this. What needs to be especially vigilant is that the result of the current youth's hesitation and depression is often to give up their basic work. They are often negligent of their due obligations and duties and do not know how to strengthen themselves. This is the biggest shortcoming of young people. We should know that our youth are determined to do great revolutionary things, which is to save people and save the world. To save people and save the world, we must place ourselves in the lowest level of society and approach the most suffering compatriots in order to improve the social environment and relieve the suffering of compatriots. Only then can the great revolutionary cause have a day of success. If we abandon this basic work and pursue fame and fortune and status, then not only will personal desires not be satisfied, but it will also be completely contrary to our revolutionary outlook on life. We must know that when we engage in revolution, we must first contribute, and then we can achieve something. We must first sacrifice, and then we can

get the price. The so-called sacrifice and contribution means that, as the Premier said, everyone must hope for the success of the revolution, so they must first sacrifice their personal freedom and personal equality, and contribute everyone's freedom and equality to the revolutionary party. Everyone must abide by the party's discipline, and everyone must obey the party's orders. The entire party must act in unison. Only when the entire party has freedom, and the individual cannot be free, can our revolution succeed. This is truly the precious teaching for our youth to engage in revolution, and it is also the only way to revolutionary success.

### Japanese Warships and Cruisers Concentrating in Waters off Hong Kong and Vietnam; Several Troop Transports also Sailing from Southern Japan; US-Japan Competition over the Dutch East Indies Intensifies

London. According to reliable foreign sources from the Far East received here, Japanese forces in the South China Sea near Hong Kong and Vietnam have greatly increased in the past few days. In the past three days, five battleships, eight cruisers, and several troop transports full of troops have been seen sailing south from Japan. Their destination is not certain, but it is believed that they are either going to Taiwan or Hainan. (Reuters, 8th)

Chongqing. The Ta Kung Pao reported recently that 60 to 70 Japanese warships are currently concentrating in Tokyo Bay, awaiting an opportunity to attack Haiphong. (Associated Press, 8th)

Singapore. The situation in Vietnam today is very unclear. This area has not received direct communication from Vietnam for five days, and the submarine telegraph office is refusing to send or receive Vietnamese telegrams. (Associated Press, 8th)

Singapore. Thai newspapers recently reported that Annam King Bảo Đại (transliteration) was assassinated in Hue last week. French sources here cannot confirm this news. (Associated Press, 8th)

Tokyo. The semi-official "Japan Times" recently published an article discussing the US government's recent commercial blockade measures, stating in brief that exports from the Dutch East Indies to Japan have greatly increased recently. The United States is closely watching this and has launched a strong economic counterattack. Its intention is to maximize the export of important raw materials such as oil, rubber, tin, iron, bauxite, chromium, and nickel from the Dutch East Indies to the United States. Regarding this matter, the Dutch East Indies authorities have provided Japan with a guarantee that they are willing to continuously export the above-mentioned important raw materials to Japan without any restrictions. Japan is discussing the implementation of this guarantee with the Dutch East Indies authorities. The United States hopes to obtain the necessary military raw materials from the southwestern Pacific, which is the same as Japan's hope. For example, 90% of the rubber and 70% of the tin needed by the United States come from the southwestern Pacific. Apart from this, there are no other sources at present. Recently, the US government decided to establish rubber and metal reserve companies, each with a capital of US$5 million, to purchase rubber, tin, manganese, etc. from the Dutch East Indies. However, the exact amount is still unknown. As the United States has actively moved, Japan will inevitably quickly catch up and compete with it. (Havas, 7th)

### Roosevelt Has Made a Decision on Whether to Run for President Again; Meeting with Farley Was Kept Secret; Democratic National Convention to be Held Mid-Month

Hyde Park. President Roosevelt yesterday told Postmaster General and Chairman of the Democratic National Committee James Farley of his historic decision to run for a third term. Farley met with the President for two hours. Although the President told Farley that he was willing to run for a third term, Farley kept it a secret and refused to disclose the contents of the conversation. At the end of the conversation, Farley told reporters, "The President was very frank with me, and I was very frank with him." Farley said, "The President's intentions are very clear to me, but I cannot tell anyone else. Only the President himself has the right to talk about this matter. I feel that the people of this country want the Democratic Party to continue to maintain its power. I already have this feeling. I spoke with the President in great detail about the Democratic Party's campaign rally and slogans. We will do our best to make the party's campaign rally even more magnificent." A reporter pointed out that the President should clarify his attitude as soon as possible, otherwise the Democratic Party representatives at the Democratic National Convention on July 15 will be in a dilemma. Farley replied, "Only the President himself can answer this question. I cannot answer it for him." (Associated Press, 8th)

### Garner Begins Campaigning in Chicago

Chicago. Vice President John Nance Garner, who opposes President Roosevelt's third term, led party members in various pre-campaign activities yesterday and established the headquarters of this movement here, because the Democratic Party's ten million dollar campaign performance will be held on July 15. The Vice President's vanguard established its headquarters in the Sherman Hotel here yesterday. The banners hanging in front of and behind the Garner headquarters read, "Follow Garner." Judging from the situation, this office will officially begin work today amid the clamor of shepherds. At the same time, a group of well-known Chicago businessmen are promoting Missouri Senator Bennett Champ Clark as the Democratic presidential candidate. As a result of President Roosevelt's refusal to declare his position, other candidates' attitudes are vague. Federal Security Administrator Paul V. McNutt is a supporter of Roosevelt's re-election. However, if Roosevelt withdraws from the election, he will participate as a presidential candidate. He reserved many large rooms in the Stevens Hotel yesterday, but it was not known as of last night whether he would station campaign personnel there. Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, who opposes President Roosevelt's re-election, also established a campaign office here and will begin work today. Democratic National Committee Chairman James Farley will arrive here on Tuesday. The work of the Democratic Party's campaign goals will begin after New York Senator Robert F. Wagner arrives here on Wednesday. (Associated Press, 8th)

### Konoe's New Political Party Temporarily Difficult to Realize

Tokyo. Local newspapers believe that Konoe's recent claim that the new political party he plans to organize cannot be realized in a month or two indicates that his hope of forming a cabinet himself is extremely small. In other words, the plan for a new political party has no connection with the reorganization of the cabinet. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

### Resumption of Navigation for Hong Kong-Vietnam British and French Vessels; Tranquility at the Hong Kong Border; Situation in Vietnam Still Unclear

Hong Kong: According to an official announcement, navigation between Hong Kong and Vietnam resumed today. Previously, authorities in both Hong Kong and Haiphong mutually detained vessels after France ordered its colonial troops to fire on any British ships sailing within twelve and a half miles of French territory. All British and French ships, except those of Japan and the United States, were prohibited from navigating. Now, with the British and French authorities reaching a mutually satisfactory agreement, British and French navigation has resumed today. (Reuters-Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

Hong Kong: The Hong Kong Telegraph reported today that authorities deny the Haiphong news reported by the Japanese news agency, which claimed that all British ships in French Vietnamese ports had been captured by the French authorities. This is completely unfounded. The newspaper also reported that Hong Kong authorities recently prohibited British and French ships from sailing to Vietnam, and Vietnamese authorities also prohibited British ships from leaving the area. However, the two sides soon reached a compromise, and passenger ships between Vietnam and Hong Kong are now operating as usual. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Hong Kong: The situation in Hong Kong is very peaceful today. British and Japanese authorities are currently working to clarify the situation in Vietnam. Navigation and aviation between Hong Kong and Vietnam, which were suspended last week due to a decision by the Vietnamese political authorities, resumed today. At least five French ships were blocked in Hong Kong and unable to sail, and the French gunboat Argus remains in the harbor today. These ships were released today after British and French authorities reached a satisfactory agreement. The British Royal Air Force's flight route has now been temporarily changed to pass through Chongqing to Rangoon (Yangon), which is a response to the Japanese demand to block the Yunnan-Burma Road. In addition, the Japanese airline between Guangzhou and Bangkok has now begun to be allowed to stop in Hanoi, which was previously rejected by the Vietnamese authorities. Well-informed sources believe that the evacuation of British women and children from Hong Kong has reduced the tension in Hong Kong, and attention has now shifted to Vietnam. The situation in Vietnam remains unclear to this day. Although Japan is still implementing a blockade on cargo transportation from Hong Kong to the mainland, there is no evidence of increased Japanese pressure on the Hong Kong border. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Hong Kong: Airmail sent from here to the United Kingdom and Australia was suspended last week due to the suspension of air service between here and Bangkok. It has now been handed over to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes for transport via Chongqing, connecting with British Imperial Airways planes in Rangoon. The first batch of mail was shipped on this route yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Hong Kong: Residents of Hong Kong are still taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the evacuation of women and children. However, today they believe that the situation here will be the same as in Tianjin, which recently ended. The general feeling is that Japan will continue to blockade Hong Kong by land, just as it did with Tianjin before. However, apart from a long exchange of diplomatic documents between the British and Japanese sides, it is believed that no serious incidents will occur. There is no special indication of involvement in the recent crisis. The British garrison has not canceled its routine leave, and the situation on the border of the leased territory remains peaceful. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

### Women and Children Evacuated from Hong Kong Arrive in Manila

Manila: A passenger ship arrived here today carrying 1,700 women and children who boarded in Hong Kong, most of whom are British. The U.S. military has reserved several large barracks for the majority of the refugees to stay in. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

Manila: The heavy rain here stopped slightly this morning, and the refugees from Hong Kong disembarked one after another. These 1,758 people were stranded on ships in Manila Bay yesterday due to the rain. U.S. military officers also came to the scene this morning to oversee the disembarkation of the refugees. Six sick people were moved from the ship last night, but none of them were in serious condition. Despite protests from the relatives and friends of the refugees, the military police at the pier strictly enforced the rules and did not allow anyone to board the ship. After the evacuees left the ship, the soldiers quickly ordered them to board vehicles and send them to the temporary inspection station at Fort McKinley for customs officials to inspect their luggage. All refugee families must strictly abide by the rules, gather in one place, and not allow children to leave their parents to avoid getting lost. Today, the Red Cross opened four dormitories in Manila and moved the refugees away from Fort McKinley after they were inspected. The society also sent some refugees waiting for treatment to the Emmanuel Hospital, and the medical expenses were also provided by the society. Saiyi, a senior U.S. official in the Philippines, personally inspected the situation on the ships, and the British Consul General in Manila, Smith, said that he was very pleased with the orderly disembarkation of the refugees and the efforts of the Red Cross and the U.S. military. HSBC also sent representatives to board the ship to allow the refugees to exchange bank drafts for Philippine pesos. The refugees were all exhausted and complained a lot. Most were dissatisfied with the forced evacuation, saying that it was neither necessary nor helpful. Many others complained about the Chinese people, saying that the evacuation was due to the fact that most Chinese refugees in Hong Kong were unwilling to leave. They also believed that the Hong Kong authorities' evacuation order was only to prevent food shortages. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

### Jiang Ting, et al., Arrive in Guilin for Inspection

More Than 200 Officers and Soldiers of French Battleship Dunkerque Die

Vichy: According to the official gazette published by the French government yesterday, the French battleship Dunkerque was attacked and injured by the British Navy on July 3.

London: French sources claimed that British troops strafed sailors on the deck of the French warship Dunkerque with machine guns, and that sailors were strafed with machine guns when they abandoned ship. The British Admiralty today officially denied this. The ship was forced aground during the British Navy's attack on the French fleet at Oran on July 3. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Diplomatic Relations Between Britain and France Have Not Been Formally Severed

London: Responsible sources here recently stated that diplomatic relations between Britain and France still exist. British interests in the non-occupied areas of France have not been entrusted to a third country for care. French diplomatic representatives in Britain can continue to act as liaisons between the two governments. As for the conflict between the British and French navies in the port of Oran, since the French Charge d'Affaires, Campbon, protested to the British government on the 5th of this month, the French government has not raised any further negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

London: A Reuters diplomatic reporter recently received news from French official sources in London that the French Embassy here has still not received any documents from its home government this morning regarding the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and France. This is very puzzling, as the delay of telegrams should not exceed 24 hours. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Alexandria Port: French Navy Holds Vote

Alexandria: The fate of the French fleet stationed in this port will be decided today by a vote of all its sailors. French sailors here will vote to decide whether to cooperate with Britain in fighting Germany or to return to France and fall into German hands. The full vote has not yet been completed, but a ship arrived here on Friday carrying sailors who wished to return to France. Yesterday, the French newspaper "Egyptian Daily" stated, "The free French on our warships have witnessed the French Navy flying the Nazi flag and the shame of being enslaved by Germany." (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

French Side Accuses Britain of Bad Faith; British Authorities Sternly Refute

London: British Prime Minister Churchill and Navy Minister Alexander have refuted the French Minister of Information, Prouvost, who claimed that Britain sent a "savage ultimatum" to the commander of the French fleet in Oran and that Britain had not contacted the Pétain government. Britain gave the French fleet in Oran the opportunity to sail to French West Indies, but the Pétain government ignored it. Churchill spoke about this in detail on July 4. As for the claim that the British government has not contacted the Pétain government, it is also untrue. According to British Navy Minister Alexander, he personally went to Bordeaux to meet with French President Lebrun, Prime Minister Pétain, Foreign Minister Baudouin, and Navy Commander-in-Chief Darlan. After the armistice conditions were announced, he and British fleet commander Pounde again called on Darlan, but ultimately felt that his request was futile. A senior staff officer of the British army in France yesterday refuted in detail in London the French accusation that the British army failed to follow General Weygand's plan at the end of May, saying that on May 22, British Commander Gort met with French First Army Commander Billotte at Ypres. Billotte explained in detail Weygand's plan for the French army to attack from the south of the Lys, while the British army and the French First Army would attack from the north of Douai and Valenciennes, so that the north and south would attack together. However, that night General Billotte died in a car accident, causing obstacles to the joint attack. On the night of May 19, the British army's right wing and rear were in a dangerous situation, and the British army had to deploy temporarily assigned troops to garrison in Lens, Douai, and Arras. They had rifles, some machine guns, and a few direct-firing guns, but no heavy artillery. However, they still fought fiercely with the enemy. At the same time, the French army on the British army's right wing had suffered extremely fierce attacks and lost a lot of military equipment, so in a state of chaos, it took several days to reorganize the army. There was a gap of about ten miles in the French army's southern front, leading to the Somme River, and the situation there was unclear. On May 20, it was decided to send two divisions of British reserve troops from Arras to attack, but a French division on the left was not prepared to attack. British Commander Gort believed that this attack had to be carried out, and ultimately achieved its first goal south of Estaires, inflicting heavy casualties on the German army and capturing many prisoners. However, German mechanized infantry had already infiltrated through this gap. In the following two days, the German army almost surrounded the British army. At that critical moment, Britain withdrew to Douai. Therefore, on the day Weygand drafted the plan, the British army had only one cavalry regiment in reserve, and the ammunition supply was not very optimistic. At that time, the ammunition available in France was 160 rounds per gun, and the British army also lacked small arms ammunition. Although it was planned to supply ammunition by parachute, it was not entirely successful. The food supply was also short, and the troops only received half rations. On May 24, due to the defeat of the Belgian army, two British divisions had to immediately move to the Belgian front to prevent the enemy from using a pincer strategy to advance on Dunkirk and cut off the British army's retreat. The next morning, he went to see French General Blanchard, and saw that he and his staff were planning to retreat as soon as possible. General Blanchard could only do this. Weygand's plan was commendable on paper, but it was too late. The first reason was that the number of German troops entering this area was large. The second reason was that the British army's left flank had been lost, and there was not enough strength to deal with both wings at the same time. At that time, the British army was defending a front line 75 miles long. The part of Weygand's plan that the French army should attack to the north was never realized. Even if the British army carried out the plan on May 26 and won a great victory in reaching the city of Cambrai, the area from Ypres to the northern position was empty, with no British army defending it, and the British army might not be able to meet the French army in the city of Cambrai, because the French army did not move out. At this point, the British side determined that it would lose the 5th and 50th divisions. During the retreat, the German army launched a frontal attack at Ypres, resulting in the slaughter of these German troops. The British army mostly did the defensive work on the sides of the British and French armies. The British army was waiting for news that the French army would attack from the front, but there was none. If the British army was surrounded, the defenders could only launch a breakout war, but if they wanted to break the siege, they would have to rely on external assistance. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Vichy: French Information Minister Prouvost broadcasted a response to British Prime Minister Churchill's remarks in the House of Commons regarding the British military action in the port of Oran, accusing Churchill of "maliciously assassinating the Dunkerque" and "sending a savage ultimatum" to the commander of the French fleet in Oran without contacting the Pétain government. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

French-Spanish Border Blocked by German Authorities

Madrid: German authorities at the French-Spanish border blocked the border last night, cutting off traffic between France and Spain. In addition, British authorities in the port of Gibraltar are reportedly stepping up the evacuation of British civilians from the port. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### German Submarine Patrols Long Distance, Sinking Several British Ships; German Side Claims Blockade of Britain is Effective

Berlin: German submarine commander Brünning spoke to reporters about the unprecedented victory of his submarine patrolling the sea. This time, a total of 66,587 tons of enemy ships were sunk. Commander Brünning said, "This was a grand patrol. It started extremely smoothly. The submarine first rescued three German Air Force personnel, who were very strong in body and spirit. I wanted them to stay on the submarine. On the third day of the patrol, we let them row a small boat in front of the submarine. They can be called the lucky stars of our submarine, because everything went very smoothly. We used all the torpedoes and shells in the submarine. After we bombed and sank nine giant ships, we encountered a 15,000-ton mutual ship on the return trip, which greatly increased the tonnage we sank to 66,587 tons. The torpedoes took a long time on the way, and then we heard a huge explosion. The torpedoes had hit the middle of the enemy ship. Flames erupted, and the great Britain lost another 15,000 tons. When we returned, we were in high spirits, and the ammunition in the submarine was exhausted." Then one of the Air Force personnel told me about his experience, saying, "My plane flew to Britain for reconnaissance, when suddenly a Blenheim enemy plane attacked my plane. The water tank in the plane was badly damaged, and one engine was also damaged. The captain was seriously injured, and I was also shot. My plane landed on the sea. The British plane kept shooting at us. When we rowed an inflatable boat about 50 yards away from the plane, the British plane left. My plane could no longer be used and immediately sank. We had no choice but to row the boat. It was very far from the coast. We had enough provisions, but very little water. The future was very bleak. The captain was dead, and my injuries were also getting worse. After we rowed the boat for 40 hours, we suddenly heard the sound of an engine. We were very afraid that it was a British ship. When we burned the remaining documents, a submarine appeared from the fog, and we saw people signaling to us. Later, one of us recognized Commander Brünning." (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

Berlin: A German military expert spoke to a Haitong News Agency reporter, supplementing yesterday's battle report, saying that the German blockade of Britain has been effective. Yesterday's battle report stated that German submarine Captain Brünning sank 66,000 tons of enemy ships during a long-distance cruise. A German speedboat sank a 6,000-ton enemy ship near the Isle of Wight, within the range of the British coastal defense battery. These are all significant results of Germany's blockade of Britain. The fact that German speedboats can threaten British shipping in the same way as submarines has now been proven by facts. The German Air Force also participated in commercial warfare. During a bombing raid on a certain part of southern England, bombs hit ships in the port, causing them to catch fire and burn on the spot. The German Air Force bombed the British Navy, and a cruiser (10,000 tons) was hit by our bombs and suffered heavy damage. Two auxiliary ships were also hit and sunk. Yesterday, an enemy submarine was also destroyed by our plane, and the crew members were rescued by our naval patrol boat. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that German submarines sank 21,500 tons of enemy cargo ships near the Spanish coast, including the armed British ship Saint Fulgardo (13,000 tons). (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 8th)

### British Submarines Disrupt German-Norwegian Traffic

London: A British Admiralty communique stated that British submarines continue to disrupt and damage German maritime traffic to Norway. The British submarine Snapper saw a German supply ship team escorted by armed fishing boats and aircraft, and fired torpedoes, hitting two ships. The remaining ships in the team scattered and fled into a bay. The Snapper later saw a large team of German ships escorted by armed fishing boats and aircraft, and attacked them, with three ships being hit by torpedoes. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### Fierce Dogfights Over the English Channel; Several German Planes Lost

London: The British Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security issued a communique last night stating that there was continued activity near the coast of the English Channel this afternoon. However, due to heavy anti-aircraft fire, no major air raids occurred. Several houses were bombed in the coastal areas, with slight casualties. This afternoon, a German fighter plane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire off the coast. A Spitfire British fighter plane shot down two Dornier German planes over the English Channel, and another German plane was seen to be injured or unable to return to its base. British and German planes fought fiercely in the air over the English Channel, and two German planes were likely destroyed, as one was seen with smoke coming from its engine, staggering erratically, and the other flew out of the firing line, descending rapidly and disappearing. The remaining German planes turned around and fled. It is now confirmed that German planes flew over the coast at several points around dawn and attacked again in the afternoon, but with no obvious results. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

London: Last night, thousands of people witnessed a British Spitfire fighter plane shoot down two German Messerschmitt 110 fighter planes over the English Channel. As a result of this battle, the German side lost four planes and the British side lost one. Today, the German military communique stated that the total number of British planes lost yesterday was 14, of which 10 were shot down during combat over the English Channel. Responsible sources here believe that this is a common tactic of the Nazis to underreport the number of losses. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### French-German Armistice Commission Adds Economic Special Delegation

Vichy: The French government announced yesterday that France has now appointed a special delegation to discuss economic issues to join the German-French Armistice Commission.

### End of German-Italian Talks: Agreement on European Situation; Discussions on Vietnam and Dutch East Indies Status; Ciano Visits German-Occupied Territories

Berlin: Official announcement, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in Berlin yesterday morning at 11:15 and immediately held talks with German leaders in Hitler's office, which lasted until 2:15 PM. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop hosted a banquet for Ciano at a hotel. Marshal Göring's newspaper stated yesterday that Ciano's purpose here was to clarify "various issues concerning Southeastern Europe" and to discuss organizing a "new European order." The visit of Italian officials to Germany is "another indication of the strong solidarity of the Rome-Berlin Axis." The Berlin meeting will enable countries occupied by Germany to "soon see the work of new national construction." The Soviet Union's activities in Southeastern Europe pose "various problems" for the Rome-Berlin Axis, and these problems must be resolved by Germany and Italy. "The two young nations (referring to Germany and Italy) must now rebuild the old continent in their hands." (United Press, 8th)

Berlin: Officials here announced that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano left here by special train last night to visit important German-occupied areas on the Western Front. The journey is expected to take about two days. (Haitong Telegraph, 8th)

Rome: Authoritative sources reported last night that Hitler and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano discussed various issues in Berlin this week, one of which concerned the future of the Dutch East Indies and French Vietnam. Authoritative sources stated that both here and in Berlin, significant attention is being paid to the relationship between French Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, and Japan. Authoritative sources pointed out that since the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, Japan's relationship with the Rome-Berlin Axis has been subtly damaged. (United Press, 8th)

London: According to a Berlin dispatch received in Rome, Hitler and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's talks reached complete agreement on the continuation and development of the war and the establishment of a new Europe. According to the Italian official news agency, Ciano left Berlin by train last night to tour German-occupied territories in the West.

Accompanying him are the Director of the Treaty Department of the German Foreign Ministry and senior officers and instructors from the German High Command. Furthermore, according to the Swiss Basler Zeitung, Hitler and Ciano discussed the invasion of England at a meeting in Berlin yesterday, with Ireland being the first place to be attacked. The two also discussed the joint adjustment of future continental relations and policies. However, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung's Berlin dispatch stated that the two leaders' meeting may be related to the development of Southeastern Europe, as Germany and Italy have the same concern for the peaceful resolution of all issues in Southeastern Europe. It is generally believed that Ciano's visit to Berlin is not necessarily related to the change in attitude of the Chiang Kai-shek government. (Reuters, 8th)

### French Parliamentarians Discuss Constitutional Issues; Divergent Opinions on the New Constitution; National Assembly Scheduled for Tomorrow

Geneva: The French Senate and Chamber of Deputies are scheduled to meet on the 9th of this month. It is generally expected that the National Assembly (i.e., the joint session of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies) will meet the following day to discuss constitutional amendments. About 450 members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies are expected to attend (out of a total of over 900 members of Parliament). (Havas, 7th)

Geneva: According to a special report received by this newspaper yesterday from the Haitong News Agency, French politics are currently undergoing transformation. It is still difficult to determine the future of the French people at this time. In the past five days, the French Parliament has met to discuss matters, and old and new ideas are still mixed together. This is because France and its people are not yet accustomed to the new elements. Under these circumstances, how to make French political parties abandon their past political theories and take on the new work of France is still a question. According to a Haitong News Agency reporter, ideological conflicts occurred on the first day of the Parliament's meeting. Some members of Parliament still insisted that the drafting of the new French Constitution should be debated and decided by the Parliament. Deputy Prime Minister Laval delivered a speech in the Chamber of Deputies, stating that the Pétain cabinet had no intention of opposing the Parliament, but would decide to oppose the Parliament when necessary. The Pétain cabinet has other tasks: to save the country and rid France of the habit of parliamentary empty talk. Laval's speech indicated that the Pétain cabinet was seeking the Parliament's consent but was also prepared to implement new political plans for France even without the Parliament's consent. In the future, the Chamber of Deputies' authority will be to pass bills proposed by Laval, not to pass bills authorizing the government by the Chamber of Deputies. This law must be passed without reservation, and the Parliament must not amend it. After the French government obtains this privilege, it will announce the new constitution that has already been drafted. This constitution stipulates that the Senate and Chamber of Deputies can only technically manage government policies. It is said that the constitution was drafted by Laval, based on the Italian government system, but still retains the characteristics of French politics, that is, the powers given to the French Chamber of Deputies are greater than those of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. The new constitution stipulates that the powers of the French provincial governments will be the same as those of the German governors, that is, the provincial governments are directly under the government's command and only have the necessary administrative powers at the local level. Since France has had a centralized political system since Napoleon I, the adoption of the new political system should achieve results early. To date, French governors have only been local police chiefs, directly under the Ministry of the Interior. In the future, the governors will be the leaders of a province, subject to the orders of all government ministries, especially the Ministry of Agriculture. (Haitong Telegraph, 8th)

### French Army Gradually Demobilizing

Geneva: The French radio station issued a message yesterday stating that the French army is currently implementing demobilization, allowing soldiers to return to their hometowns as soon as possible to engage in agricultural work. Therefore, France's demobilization work is not based on seniority but depends on the agricultural needs of various regions. Therefore, regardless of seniority or age, those who are urgently needed in various regions to engage in agriculture can be demobilized first. The radio station continued to say that France currently faces extreme difficulties in transporting food, and there is a lack of transportation. Therefore, it is impossible to demobilize the entire army at once. Moreover, local authorities in various provinces are already finding it difficult to supply local food. If the entire army is demobilized and returns to various regions, it will definitely increase the local difficulties. Therefore, the government hopes that officers and soldiers at all levels will remain calm and wait for gradual demobilization. (Haitong Telegraph, 8th)

### US Foreign Policy Association Advocates US-Soviet Cooperation to jointly guarantee China's independence and maintain the status quo in Southeast Asia

Washington: The Foreign Policy Association released a report yesterday stating that if the United States and the Soviet Union establish an agreement to jointly guarantee China's independence and maintain the status quo in Southeast Asia, the United States' Far East defense will be further strengthened. The report stated, "Unless the United States and the Soviet Union conclude such an agreement, the Soviet Union, which continues to aid China, will not be provoked to interfere with Japan's expansion of power in the South Seas." Germany's progress in Europe has caused the United States to encounter a dangerous problem in its Western Pacific policy. As for the new US-Japan commercial treaty, it is even said that ceding China as a gift to Japan to fill Japan's insatiable desires is indeed doubtful. As for whether a strong plan can limit Japan or provoke retaliatory actions, it is still difficult to determine for the time being. "Unless the United States and the Soviet Union cooperate closely, any US action to oppose Japanese aggression may only be effective when the US fleet can be stationed in the Pacific without taking into account the Atlantic." (United Press, 8th)

Yarnell Attacks Japan's Control of the Far East

Washington: Former US Asian Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell recently made a statement attacking Japan's control of the Far East. He said, "Recently, newspaper editorials have mostly advocated the establishment of a treaty and a new commercial treaty between the US and Japan to improve the US's position in the Pacific. This kind of argument is of course due to the influence of the European war. Whether these people who advocate the establishment of an agreement or a commercial treaty between the US and Japan have a thorough understanding of the nature of the war in the Far East and Japan's goals in the Far East, I really cannot help but doubt. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Japan's history has been a history of aggression against China. Taiwan, Korea, and Manchuria have been seized by the Japanese. The fate of the people under Japanese control has not only not improved but has worsened. Korea is one example. Japan's sole purpose is to enslave the local people and control prices through monopolistic methods, so that all profits go to its own benefit. All foreign commerce and power must be completely excluded. Japan has taken these steps in the occupied areas of China. The Japanese government in Tokyo is completely controlled by the military. The policy of the Japanese military is to occupy all of China and the British, French, and Dutch colonies in the Far East, and to exclude the Western people altogether. Japan is also a totalitarian state, and its war aims are completely the same as those of Germany and Italy, namely, to rule most of the world and hundreds of millions of foreign people by force. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's policy is actually to gain control of all regions in the Far East, and his so-called "Monroe Doctrine" is obviously a misunderstanding and is used to deceive the United States.

Peace Can Only Be Ensured if China is Stable

The greatest driving force for seeking peace in the Far East and the world is to make China a free and stable China. The United States has signed a treaty with Japan, asking it to help maintain China's independence and territorial integrity. To date, any treaty with Japan will inevitably contain the following conditions: (1) Abandon the Nine-Power Treaty and the Open Door Policy, and recognize these treaties as waste paper; (2) Recognize the "New Order in East Asia;" (3) Abandon and sell out China, which is fighting for freedom, and make its people disappear from hatred; (4) Abandon the position achieved by American businessmen, doctors, educators, and priests through many years of effort; (5) Expand absolutism throughout the world. This issue, the basis of our future policy, is extremely important. Will we base our policy on principles of morality, honor, justice, humanity, human rights, and respect for promises, or will we cross out these principles and compromise with totalitarians, hoping to establish a situation that allows both ideals to coexist in the post-World War organization? Under the current circumstances, if we negotiate with Japan, the only result we will obtain will be national shame." (United Press, 8th)

### William King Reiterates Nine-Power Treaty, Condemns Japanese Aggression

Washington: Utah Democratic Senator William King recently strongly advocated that the Democratic Party adopt a political platform that reiterates the US's responsibility for the Nine-Power Treaty and indirectly condemns Japanese aggression. King said, "We should of course make a declaration stating that we cannot tolerate destructive actions. We have repeatedly opposed supplying Japan with arms. If necessary, I would very much like the United States to sever diplomatic relations with Japan." (United Press, 8th)

### Roosevelt Prepares Message to Congress, Requests Huge Defense Budget

Washington: It is expected that President Roosevelt will send a message to Congress in the middle of this week regarding the nationwide preparedness action, requesting a defense budget of $5 billion for the armament of the second batch of one million soldiers. It is heard that this new procedure also plans to provide more convenience for arms manufacturing. (Reuters, 8th)

### Northern Ireland Prime Minister Visits Churchill, Discusses Neutrality Issue

London: Northern Ireland Prime Minister Craigavon came to London yesterday and had "most satisfactory" talks with British Prime Minister Churchill and others. Northern Ireland Finance Minister Andrews recently said in Belfast that if Northern Ireland abandons its boundaries and unites with Southern Ireland according to the Valera treaty, Northern Ireland will become neutral and will not actively fight on the side of Great Britain, as it is now. He believes that this kind of neutrality is unimaginable. (Reuters, 8th)

London: Northern Ireland Prime Minister Craigavon, after conferring with British cabinet members, including Prime Minister Churchill, on defense in London and achieving "most satisfactory results," returned to Belfast this morning. When asked whether the talks during this trip were related to the proposal for unification between Northern and Southern Ireland, Craigavon replied, "We will concentrate our efforts on our own defense, in order to achieve perfection." (Reuters, 8th)

### India Demands Complete Independence

New Delhi: The Indian National Congress Council passed a resolution demanding that Britain announce its approval of India's complete independence and first organize a provisional national government. If this request is met, the National Congress is willing to devote all its efforts to reorganizing India's defense. (Reuters, 8th)

### Bloody Tragedy Occurs During Mexican Election; Over a Hundred Killed and Wounded Nationwide; Chaotic Situation Remains Severe

Mexico City: As a result of the conflicts during yesterday's presidential election, a total of 47 people were killed nationwide, and at least 75 were injured, including two American expatriates who died. Mexican President General Cárdenas personally appeared to stop a fight on a street here after six people were killed by machine guns and seventeen were injured. He found the leaders of the two opposing factions among the fleeing crowds and finally reconciled them. Currently, military and police are stationed at every street corner here, and the situation remains very serious. According to the headquarters of the National Revolutionary Party, the party's presidential candidate, General Camacho, has won in 22 of the 29 states. (Reuters, 8th)

Mexico City: Two American tourists were injured in riots during the election here yesterday. The two have been identified as Delsol from New Jersey and Mullen from Ysleta, Texas. Delsol was shot in the waist, and Mullen was shot in the abdomen. (International News Service, 8th)

Mexico City: Thirty people died and fifty were injured in the riots during yesterday's election here, a bloody tragedy unprecedented in decades. Although the authorities here made every effort to prevent it beforehand, four people died and fifteen were injured in the capital. There have also been reports of casualties in other cities. According to the government's Revolutionary Party radio transmission, General Camacho received the most votes in this election. However, those who support General Almazán, the commander of the Madrano army, have said that these reports are altered by the enemy party. According to the US authorities' estimate a month ago, confusion will inevitably occur. The results of Sunday's vote will not be officially announced until August 25. Although the military and police throughout Mexico are armed, it is difficult to predict whether this riot will lead to a nationwide revolution. Former Army Chief General Hohmann, who is supported by the Mexican Nazi Party, and Tabia, who has the support of a small number of people, are also candidates in this election. Today, General Almazán re-warned that if there is fraud in this election, he will organize the Congress he leads as a "legitimate government." Observers believe that he may be able to carry out this statement. (International News Service, 8th)

Mexico City: Conflicts occurred in Puebla province during the Mexican presidential election. Because there are currently two major opposing factions in Mexico, the competition is fierce. The governor of the province is the younger brother of Camacho. The Camacho faction and the Almazán faction clashed, resulting in two deaths and two injuries in the Almazán faction. A conflict also occurred in Mexico City, but only one person died, namely General Francisco. The murderer has been arrested. It is heard that the Camacho faction has the upper hand in most polling stations. According to current estimates, 47 people have sacrificed their lives due to conflicts arising from the presidential election. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

### British Forces in North Africa Cut Off Italian Water Pipeline; Three Italian Submarines Sunk

Cairo: The British war report released here last night stated that British patrols in the Western Desert had again penetrated deep into the enemy's front line and cut off the water pipeline from Bardia to Capuzzo. According to further news, in the Battle of Gazala on July 4, the enemy lost eight light tanks, two aircraft, and 300 soldiers. A Reuters special correspondent recently traveled to a certain place in the Egyptian desert and saw a large amount of Italian war equipment recently captured by the British army, including over 6,000 brand-new anti-aircraft guns, flat-trajectory guns, 4 million rounds of ammunition, binoculars, and battlefield telephone equipment. A large number of tanks west of Marsa Matruh in Libya, about 200 miles away, are also in British hands. (Reuters, 8th)

Cairo: Details of the British Air Force's recent attacks on Italian submarines in the Mediterranean have been released as follows: a British seaplane, while patrolling, glimpsed a submarine periscope and quickly dropped a special bomb. Two bombs hit the submarine's conning tower. The submarine's head rose out of the water and then sank vertically, with oil spreading hundreds of yards away. The next day, the seaplane saw another Italian submarine on the sea surface and dropped bombs on it, hitting it several times. The submarine immediately overturned, and several crew members were blown into the sea. The British aircraft then landed on the water and rescued three lieutenants and one junior officer. When the aircraft was flying back, it saw another submarine on the sea surface, but because there were no bombs left in the aircraft, it flew low and fired guns at the submarine's conning tower and bridge twice. The submarine then sank vertically. (Reuters, 8th)

Rome: According to the Italian military headquarters' war report, the Italian Air Force bombed the British military ports of Malta and Alexandria yesterday, with great success. Two Italian aircraft did not return. Motorized units fought on the Cyrenaica front. The Italian army destroyed several enemy vehicles and captured one tank and one armored vehicle. Enemy aircraft attacked Tobruk on the 5th of this month and were shot down three, and another was probably destroyed. In East Africa, Italian aircraft bombed motorized units near Kassala and attacked the airfields of Malakal and Berim. (Haitong Telegraph, 8th)

### Fujian Education Director Publishes Opinions on Inspecting Southern Fujian Education; Generally Satisfied with the Schools' Operations

Yongan Correspondence: Zheng Zhenwen, Director of the Fujian Education Department, inspected schools at all levels and social education institutions in six counties, including Datian, Dehua, Yongchun, Anxi, Nan'an, and Xianyou, in March of this year. He returned to the provincial capital of Yongan in April and recently published the following impressions of his inspection:

Generally, I am satisfied with the operations of the schools in southern Fujian. Generally speaking, the students' physiques, spirits, and attitudes are extremely strong and lively, worthy of being the best in the province. The academic atmosphere is also quite good. Even the current situation of the few schools that had accidents in the past is not as serious as rumored. In terms of primary education, because most of the people in southern Fujian live overseas and have ample financial resources, enthusiasm for education has become a common practice. If one village sets up a primary school, another village will definitely set up another primary school to compete with it. As a result, there are many cases of schools being built with sole investments. After the school system was reformed this time, Nan'an County alone has established a school in almost two townships. In the Shishan area, a school has already been established in one township. The number of schools in other counties also exceeds the provincial standards. In short, in terms of the number of schools established, with the exception of Datian and Dehua, the general standard has been met. In terms of faculty, there is a temporary shortage before a large number of teachers are trained in this province, and many are not satisfactory. In terms of school buildings and equipment, the common characteristics of Nan'an, Yongchun, Anxi, and other counties are that they are mostly new stone and lime buildings built with private donations. Director Zheng also attaches great importance to overseas Chinese education. After returning to Yongan from the inspection, he instructed the relevant departments to allow overseas Chinese students from various schools in the past who participated in the graduation examination and failed one or two subjects but went abroad without taking the make-up examination to be allowed to take the make-up examination by the consulate of their place of residence entrusted by the department. He also instructed them to prepare investigation forms and distribute them to various schools to fill in the names of overseas Chinese students who should take the make-up examination, the subjects they failed, and their residential addresses. In addition, because the procedures for overseas Chinese students transferring to schools in the province are often not fully compliant, he also ordered the drafting of "Instructions for Overseas Chinese Students Transferring to Schools" to be sent to the consulates of various places to inform the schools in those places, so as to facilitate overseas Chinese students returning to the province to study.

### Jiangsu Education Department Holds Graduation Spot Checks for Middle Schools; Over Twenty Schools Spot Checked in Northern Jiangsu

Northern Jiangsu Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department has adopted the spirit of the middle school graduation examination and organized graduation spot checks to adapt to the current environment. It has been reported previously. It is now learned that Director Tian had previously issued various measures related to the graduation examination and graduation spot checks, stipulating that the graduation examination for all middle schools in northern Jiangsu this year should start on June 19 and end on June 22. All three-year graduation examinations should start on June 19 and end on June 22. All courses studied in the past three years, such as civics, Chinese, English, arithmetic, history, geography, chemistry, biology, and education courses for normal schools, and vocational courses for vocational schools, are included in the examination. The examination time is stipulated by the department, and all schools in the province hold the examination at the same time. All test papers are sealed. Each school organizes a graduation examination committee, with the principal as the chairman. The Jiangsu Education Department organizes a graduation spot check committee to be responsible for all graduation spot check matters in the province. On the one hand, it sends personnel to carry test questions to various schools for spot checks. Schools that are not spot checked will not be notified separately and will be handled by the graduation examination committee at that time. The principal is responsible for presiding over all aspects of the graduation examination. It is heard that this time, over twenty public and private high and junior middle schools in the northern Jiangsu province and counties were spot checked, which is helpful in urging students to work hard to improve their level.

### Fujian Vigorously Promotes Music Education, Establishes Musical Instrument Factory; First Manufactures Chinese Musical Instruments

Yongan Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Government, in view of the lack and simplicity of music equipment in schools at all levels in the province, which makes it difficult for good teachers to exert their teaching effectiveness and reduces students' interest in learning, greatly affecting the future of music education, but it is very difficult to purchase from abroad at this time. In order to solve this problem and encourage production, it has ordered the provincial music college to establish a musical instrument factory and has allocated funds for preparation. It is now learned that Principal Cai Jikun of the college, after receiving the order, has begun active preparations for selecting raw materials and hiring technicians. According to Cai, there are many high-quality timbers produced in the province, and some are suitable for making violins and other stringed instruments. It is planned to start with manufacturing Chinese musical instruments, percussion instruments, harmoniums, and harmonicas, and then gradually expand. The factory also plans to set up a repair department to repair various brass and woodwind instruments, as well as harmoniums and pianos.

### Change of Principal at Yu Ying Middle School

Since the private Yu Ying Middle School moved to Shanghai and resumed classes, it has been two years. Through diligent planning, the school has gradually taken shape. The school acquired its own campus at 4 Jueyuan Road, Edinburgh Road two years ago.

For outstanding and impoverished students, a scholarship program has been established.

### Jiang Zhuzhuang Raises Patriotic Fund

As reported yesterday, Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang, a respected figure in educational circles, has taken over as the principal of Patriotic Girls' Middle School after the passing of Principal Ji. It is now reported that the late Principal Ji had a life insurance policy of 12,000 yuan. Principal Jiang believes that Principal Ji had already contributed significantly to the school during his lifetime. Although he has no children, his wife remains in their hometown, facing impoverished circumstances, which is truly pitiful. Therefore, it is proposed that the entire sum be inherited by his family members, but the inheritance rights must be transferred through legal procedures. As for the school's fund, Principal Jiang will raise it separately, so that both public and private interests can be taken care of.

### New Initiatives at Zhaofeng Public School

Since the Yuyuan Road Zhaofeng Public School was reorganized and the middle school department was added by the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Taoist Association and filed with the Ministry of Education, the number of primary and secondary school students has greatly increased. Dr. Ai Xiangde, the school board member and honorary principal, was originally the Bishop of the Chinese Christian Taoist Association and is currently the President of the Hong Kong Theological Research Institute. He has been in China for decades, is enthusiastic about education, and has a long-standing reputation. It is recently reported that Dr. Ai, to cultivate religious talents, will recommend students who graduate from the school's junior high school and have a solid faith to study at the Hong Kong Research Institute. During their studies, in addition to the institute providing room and board, they will also receive a monthly allowance. After graduation, the institute will also assign them to various church jobs. Those with outstanding academic performance may be sponsored by the institute for further studies abroad. Furthermore, the school's summer tutoring program has already begun, with no tuition fees charged. All new and returning students can enjoy the tutoring.

### Seventh Act of Hezhong Cup Basketball: You Lian vs. Qun Yi Today; Xi Hua vs. Mu Er at 5:30; Women's Performance Added on Saturday

The schedule for this week's Hezhong Cup Charity Basketball League has been announced yesterday. Starting at 5:30 today, the first game will be between Xi Hua and Mu Er in the second division. The strength of the two teams is evenly matched. Starting at 6:30, the game will be between You Lian and Qun Yi. You Lian's recent two results were a victory over Qi Fan and a loss to Xi Qing in the Bai Le Dou Championship. The performance shows sharpness. The victory over Qi Fan was characterized by a strong and decisive fighting spirit. The loss to Bai Le Men was due to a slight miscalculation, leading to a constricted atmosphere. However, their threat to the Shanghai League champion was not diminished. Their loss was truly not their fault. Qun Yi is the incarnation of Xu Fang. Although they have suffered two losses in recent two games, one was to Liang Xi and the other was to Hu Qing. Hu Qing is one of the two giants in Shanghai. Qun Yi only lost by eight points, which shows their skill. Their loss to Liang Xi was because their main player, Tao Shaosheng, was closely guarded by the opponent, resulting in a loss of scoring opportunities. However, Qun Yi had good performances in both games, which shows their strength is not ordinary. Today's encounter with You Lian is bound to create a shocking situation, which can be predicted. Tickets are five corners, and the number of seats is still limited to four hundred. The games at the end of the week will have more exciting situations. In the first division, Qun Yi will meet Bai Le Men on Saturday. This is Qun Yi's true touchstone. The opening act before this game will be a women's performance. The opposing teams have not yet been determined. The organizers are now increasing the interest of the competition and promoting women's basketball, and will try their best to provide the local women's strong teams with opportunities to perform. All strong women's basketball teams that are confident enough to show their skills can register with Zhou Zhi at Bai Le Men starting today so that they can be inserted into performances in the future. The registration date is limited to Thursday (11th) of this week. The first division game on Sunday will be Hu Qing vs. You Lian. The tense atmosphere of this game is expected. At the same time, the prelude will be Bai Le Men vs. Nanyang. This week's order is as follows:

### Xu Chengji Plays Basketball in Java to Help Compatriots in Distress: Maiden Performance Raises 1,200 Guilders

(Special Dispatch from Singapore) Xu Chengji, a famous Chinese tennis player, has been silent since his return from a tour of Europe to Java. According to news from the Dutch East Indies, Mr. Xu recently made his maiden performance in Batavia after returning to Java, raising approximately 1,200 guilders, which were remitted to the motherland to aid wounded soldiers and refugees.

### Finance: American Banks Have Quite a Bit of Inflow; Foreign Exchange Slightly Reacts

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing showed no changes. In the dark market for British-American exchange, the trend entered a hovering state, tightening after loosening, and then loosening again after tightening. As a result, there was a slight contraction. Although there was no fresh stimulus, speculators had a strong appetite throughout the day, but the amount was not large. Throughout the day, American banks had the strongest intention to enter, and the transaction volume was particularly high. The market was slightly affected. At the beginning of the morning, Japanese and Chinese banks both sold, so the potential was long. Later, after American banks and others fiercely absorbed it, it returned to softness. The midday closing was mediocre, and the market situation in the afternoon was also very mediocre. Only because speculators entered the market to buy and absorb, the closing market showed a slight softening. As a result, British gold was at four points, and the American exchange rate was 6.21875 yuan, a decrease of 0.03125 and 0.0825 respectively compared to the closing on Saturday.

The current American exchange rate was sold to HSBC for a total of 6.375 yuan. Some Chinese speculators also entered the July American exchange rate for 6.21875 yuan, but soon American banks' buying intentions suddenly emerged, buying the Chinese mainland's current American exchange rate for 6.3125 yuan. The market gradually softened, once retreating to the current American exchange rate of 6.25. However, near noon, Chinese speculators re-emerged in the July American exchange rate, and the American banks' appetite was slightly stagnant, causing the potential to harden again. As a result, there was no difference in honor or disgrace compared to the morning opening price. British gold remained at four points, and the American exchange rate was 6.28125 yuan, and the futures were also the same.

Speculators Absorbing

The market was still flat in the afternoon. After opening, exporters sold to American banks for 4.015625 for current first order.

### New Purchases Cause Gold Price to Rise

Yesterday's cash bar (smelted gold) dark market situation entered a better state. Although the rise was not particularly fierce, the sentiment was quite upward. Because there were many who hoped for higher prices and made new purchases. The opening in the morning was 5,150 yuan, which was heard to be due to the gold shop gang absorbing it. Subsequently, silver shops sold aggressively, pushing it down to 5,060 yuan. Thanks to the Hong Kong gang and retail investors, it was raised again to 5,140 yuan. The midday closing was 5,115 yuan. The sentiment in the afternoon was quite energized. After opening at 5,120 yuan, it immediately rose to 5,140 yuan. However, a certain gold shop sold some, and it fell slightly again. As a result, it was heard that the exchange rate was tightening, which was good news. There were rumors that "a certain bank" was secretly absorbing it, and securities firms and others searched for and bought some, closing at 5,190 yuan, a rise of 145 yuan compared to the weekend. Furthermore, the off-market was even stronger, reaching 5,215 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was about 2,700-800 liang. Silver shop ornaments were raised by 20 yuan, and customs gold and others remained flat.

Smelted Gold Rises by More Than One Hundred Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, the foreign exchange rate was reported to be tight, and the sentiment was unusually firm. There was a crowd of buyers, and both money changers and gold shops had an appetite, leading to the opening under a buying wave, raised by 105 yuan. Silver shops sold 50 liang to gold shops, for 5,150 yuan. Then, because the price opened too high, it caused many parties to sell, and the number of entrants decreased. Before long, it fell back 60 yuan. Silver shops sold 10 liang to gold shops, falling back to 5,090 yuan. Then, securities firms suddenly showed buying intentions, and sellers decreased, and it was raised again by 40 yuan. Securities firms bought 10 liang from silver shops, for 5,130 yuan. However, a certain money changer suddenly dumped it, and the Tianjin gang also sold secretly, and it fell slightly by 70 yuan again. Silver shops did 10 liang, and the lowest price was 5,060 yuan. After that, silver shop gangs frequently picked up at low prices, and Hong Kong gangs were active in the middle, and it rose again by 80 yuan.

Money changers sold 10 liang to silver shops, falling back to 5,115 yuan as the midday closing price. The opening was slightly higher in the afternoon. First, gold shops sold 10 liang to silver shops, for 5,120 yuan. Then, securities firms and money changers absorbed it and it rose by 20 yuan. Silver shops and jewelers did 10 liang, for 5,140 yuan. Later, another securities firm came to sell, and soon a certain gold shop continued to sell, and a certain bank also sold on behalf of the Tianjin gang, and it fell back by 35 yuan. Silver shops sold 20 liang to gold shops, for 5,105 yuan. Unexpectedly, the market situation hardened again after that. Money changers, securities firms, and silver shops all came to compete for purchases. At the same time, a certain gold shop also reversed from selling to buying, and because the foreign exchange rate was tight, there were not many sellers, and the price jumped by 85 yuan. Money changers sold 20 liang to gold shops, for 5,190 yuan. Last night's closing price resulted in a rebound of 145 yuan compared to the previous Saturday, which was the rebound after four consecutive days of decline totaling nearly 385 yuan.

### Securities Short-Lived Rally in Domestic Debt

Yesterday's securities gray market continued to be weak, and trading also suddenly decreased. No Type Ding bonds were traded at all, and no one inquired about Type Wu bonds in the afternoon. The so-called new loans have no progress news, and the bulls were once excited, but failed to arouse general interest, so the rally was short-lived, rising and falling quickly. There was more trading yesterday morning, with Lianyi Jiufeng and No. 11 being bought quite a bit, and Lemao Datong and No. 16 being sold off. The market price was stable. In the afternoon, Lianhe sold about 100,000, but the buyers were very few, and the market became sluggish. Types Ding and Wu were not traded at all.

### Grain Glutinous Rice Rises Sharply by Three or Four Yuan, Foreign Rice Market Suddenly Weakens

Yesterday morning, the rice market initially opened with both buyers and sellers remaining cautious, especially since the price evaluation will be implemented today, causing guest traders to adopt a more conservative approach. Until midday, except for local stores which slightly increased purchases for emergency needs, the rest were rarely inquired about. Sellers, seeing the declining sales floor and the continuous influx of large quantities of foreign rice, and feeling that the general trend was precarious at a high level and about to fall, became increasingly uneasy. In an instant, the prices of various foreign rice types were like a dam bursting, plunging all the way down. As a result, at the close, except for mid- to high-end goods, which were fortunately selling somewhat steadily and depreciated by one to one and a half yuan compared to the previous week, Number One aged Saigon was 65 yuan, Number Two 63 yuan, 62.5 yuan, Number One Siam 65 yuan, Number Two 62.5 yuan, Fire-hulled 64 yuan, 63.5 yuan, Hong Kong Point 63 yuan, 62.5 yuan, Small-hulled 62 yuan, 61.8 yuan. Other lower-grade goods of various types, due to the stoppage of inland routes and the impending implementation of price-controlled rice sales in the local area, experienced even greater decline, plummeting by a huge two to three yuan. The lowest price of Tokyo Stone Point was only 58 to 59 yuan, Red Rice 57 to 58 yuan, Broken Point ranged from 51.2 yuan at the high end to 47 yuan, Second-grade 45 to 46 yuan, Rice Green around 53 yuan. Foreign rice, because the Siam rice ordered and loaded on the 18th of last month had already arrived, people's hearts were slightly discouraged, and the market changed from tight to weak. Yinghua Company opened trading of Siam Number Two rice at a price of 76 yuan in the morning, then dropped to 75.75 yuan to 7 yuan, and at the close it was 75 yuan. The price for cargo loaded on the 20th was 73.5 yuan to 3 yuan, and the price for cargo loaded on the 26th was 72.2 yuan to 72 yuan, all down by more than one yuan compared to the previous prices. The total transaction volume was 775 tons. In addition, over 6,000 bags of spot goods were traded, and the price also fell by about one yuan.

More foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou ship arrived from Hong Kong with 3,359 bags yesterday morning and berthed at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is reported that Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship also carried over 15,000 bags from Hong Kong, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, but due to the typhoon at sea, it was changed to enter the port this morning. (Zu)

Glutinous rice rose sharply by a large three to four yuan yesterday, because goods have been in short supply for a long time, warehouse stocks have been sharply reduced, and scarcity has made the sales floor expensive. Guest traders were afraid of missing out, creating an unexpected high price due to supply falling short of demand. Open-Jin Liyang Special was 70 yuan, Chang Dan White 69 yuan, Second-grade 68 yuan, Jiangbei Second-grade 66 to 67 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous rice 70 yuan.

Another 1,400 to 1,500 bags of thick and thin japonica rice arrived. It is rumored that outside speculators, influenced by foreign rice, were also showing signs of softening, but the selling price was still unchanged. Changbang Special Clear Japonica still needed 74.7 to 78 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun White Japonica 72 to 73 yuan, Second-grade down to 70 yuan, Qingsi Thin Rice 72 to 73 yuan, Nangang Early Rice Special from 71 yuan, Second-grade down to 69 yuan, inferior quality at 67 to 68 yuan, and so on.

### Flour Supply Falls Short of Demand Wheat Sources Remain Difficult to Unblock

The flour market was firm yesterday, because the supply from Chinese flour mills was still maintained by Fufeng Mill in this street, at only five or six thousand bags per day. The needs of local traders were naturally not met, so they could only rely on Japanese mills and miscellaneous brands of flour from the inland. Recently, the inland supply has been continuous and the distribution routes have been quite active. Yesterday, Jinshan brand opened at 16.5 yuan, Phoenix brand at 16.3 yuan, and Qiangsheng Flour at 16.45 yuan. The price of the July/August Green Phoenix opened at 16.42 yuan. Inland Jinyou brand flour rose by another dime compared to last week, while Phoenix brand showed signs of loosening. About 10,000 bags were traded. The factory price of Lao Che Brand still maintained its original price of 15.2 yuan. Lao Che recycled flour had no official market price.

Wheat: Yesterday's market still lacked official development. However, on the Japanese merchant side, it was heard that nearly 10,000 bags of wheat had been shipped in, priced at 23 to 24 yuan. On the Chinese mill side, there were occasional small shipments, but no large quantities could be collected. The news from grain merchants that transport permits would be issued this week still had no concrete measures. It was also heard that Japanese mills had also settled a shipment of American wheat, but this could not be confirmed. On the Chinese mill side, there were indeed contacts for Australian wheat, and continued orders were being placed.

### Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Sales Still Acceptable

The prices of miscellaneous grains are only traded for half a day in the morning during the summer season. An investigation of the market's buying and selling attitudes did not feel the constraints of time, and yesterday's trading also continued to decrease. The prices of various types were also lurking in a flat, weak, and humiliating state. However, the broad bean market was strongly supported by Japanese merchants and aided by the Xinghua gang, so the trend remained stable. It is estimated that over 1,800 bags of Jiading White Skin Broad Beans were traded at a price of 23.3 yuan to 23 yuan, 200 bags of Wuhu Small Grain White Skin Broad Beans at a price of 19.1 yuan, and over 300 bags of Beigang Green Skin Broad Beans at a price of 21.9 yuan.

Also, one hundred bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday, and another 480 bags and 300 bags of raw peanuts will be shipped to Hong Kong today. In addition, 1,000 bags of sesame and 1,095 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Singapore.

### Yarn & Cotton Yarn Market Quiet, Few New Purchases

The yarn market is calm and the trend is stable. As for actual transactions, transportation to South China has been reopened, so the Hong Kong gang is more active in purchasing coarse and fine yarns than in the past, and people's hearts have been revitalized. The Zhejiang East region is also constantly purchasing, so although the environment is harsh, the market feels more peaceful. However, there are very few new purchases. Therefore, the situation is still being maintained.

The current yarn market opened in the morning with a peaceful atmosphere. It also opened for small-scale trading. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 910 yuan. It was then heard that there was not much change in the exchange rate, and although there was no large demand for current sales in the Guangdong gang, small-scale transactions were still able to be maintained. The market gradually rose, reaching 923 yuan, and the close was slightly setback. An investigation of half-day transaction statistics showed 1,985 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse fell by two yuan. Shenxin No. 2 Factory opened 700 bales of 20-count Tiannv yesterday at a price of 930 yuan. Tongyi Factory opened 600 bales of 23-count Golden Rooster at a price of 1,000 yuan, all of which were internal purchases. There were fifty pieces of cotton yarn yesterday, and another ninety-five pieces today, all of which were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 670, Peers 1,110, Ningbo 55, Total 1,985, Inland 50

### Cotton Demand Slightly Active

Spot cotton trading is still in a quiet state. However, the Japanese mills have slightly active demand, but the market price is flat and the attitude of the Chinese mills remains scattered. Tongzhou cotton is priced at 154 yuan, 95 bales were purchased internally. Indian cotton is 180 yuan, 600 pieces were purchased internally, all spot warehouse deliveries. Business is slightly more active and not as sluggish as in the past.

Another report: The spot price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market initially fell slightly in the morning due to selling in the South, but later due to purchases by spot merchants and the offsetting of short positions, as well as spot merchants selling near-term and buying far-term futures, the closing price resulted in the near-term price falling by ten basis points, while the far-term price rose by eight or nine basis points. The Indian market situation is firm. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose sharply by ten rupees.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has gradually become more active in recent days. Japanese factories have slightly active demand, but the transaction amount is not large, all are silver futures transactions. In recent days, there has been a transaction volume of four to five thousand bales. However, Chinese mill trading remains extremely quiet. According to the current situation, foreign cotton has entered a turning point.

### Piece Goods Current Market Insufficient to Cover Costs, Most Cloth Factories Suspend Work

The cloth market is flat. Actual sales are still strong. Because the current market is insufficient to cover costs, most cloth factories have temporarily suspended work. The output in the future will naturally be sharply reduced, so people's hearts have stabilized slightly. Traders and dyeing factories are taking advantage of the low prices to search for purchases. The opening prices of various goods are not much different from the previous week. A small portion of cloth prices continued to fall by about 2.5 cents per piece. In this street, tens of thousands of pieces of grey cloth, plain cloth, and bleached and dyed cloth were traded. The Yong-Wen-Tai gang purchased nearly 200 pieces of Dapeng, Fugui, fine cloth, twill, colored cloth, and woolen cloth.

Dongbu White Goods, Longtou fine cloth, opened in the morning at 27.7 yuan, and then rose to 27.95 yuan at the close due to the firm confidence of traders in this street. Four Gentlemen Serge sold from 8.25 cents per yard to 8.3 cents. Over 500 pieces of various brands of fine cloth and about 200 boxes of serge were traded on the market. Among the miscellaneous brands of fine cloth, the Shuanglongzhu brand produced in Qingdao was the most popular, because the source was lacking. The Bengbu gang pointed out that spot goods were sold yesterday for 28.1 yuan per piece.

Exports: 4 pieces of piece goods were transported to Hong Kong on the 8th, 1,000 pieces were transported to Ningbo, 60 pieces were transported to Singapore on the 9th, and 18 pieces were transported to Hong Kong. On the 8th, 61 pieces of piece goods arrived from Hong Kong.

### Coal Tongdeli Coal Retreats

Although there have been rumors recently about British ships stopping navigation of Haiphong, and there are concerns about the interruption of foreign coal, the white coal business has not been able to increase because actual sales are not moving and local inventories are very sufficient. Yesterday, a certain number opened an old single Tongdeli block on behalf of customers, and the gray market only traded at 188 yuan, warehouse self-pickup, and handling fees were added separately, which was a four to five yuan retreat compared to last week.

### Sugar Market Dutch Red Continues to be Approved, Up One Yuan Compared to Previous Price

Yesterday's sugar market was initially flat and then tight. Because it was rumored in the afternoon that the Hong Kong situation was tight again, and the exchange rate was shrinking, people's hearts turned better. The Association allocated spot goods of 24 coarse white at the warehouse in the morning at 67 yuan to 67.5 yuan, and 78 yuan in the afternoon, up 6 cents. Outside the warehouse, it was only 66.5 yuan to 67 yuan in the beginning, 67.5 yuan in the afternoon, and 68 yuan later. Re-exports were 52.5 yuan to 53 yuan in the morning and 53.5 yuan in the afternoon. The 20th Warehouse Receipt was 54 yuan. The Taikoo Car White B Mark was initially 77.5 yuan and 78 yuan in the afternoon. The H Mark Car Red was 55.8 yuan. 1,852 bags of Dutch Red were opened by the Joint Venture at 57 yuan. The factory's Snow White was 68 yuan, Number One Ice 90.5 yuan, and Jingming Ice 92 yuan, with not much fluctuation. For domestic sugar, only the Xinghua gang opened dozens of bags of ordinary Xinghua Qing at 62.5 yuan. The Hong Kong gang arrived with a batch of Ice Flower Qing, and the asking price reached 75 yuan, but no deal was made.

### North-South Goods Yuanhong Lychee Poor Harvest

It is heard that the Yuanhong lychee dried fruit produced in Yihua has a poor harvest this year, so the handling price is very high. According to the news, the cost of Shen Bao is about 200 yuan, and it is expected to offer new products soon.

### New Lanzhou Bamboo Will Arrive Soon

According to a letter from a guest trader, the first batch of new Lanzhou bamboo branches is expected to arrive in Shen within ten days. According to the original intention of the cargo customer, it is also intended to sell cash, so the customer number and the association have public letters notifying the Shen market numbers and associations, but whether it can be implemented still depends on the overall situation.

### Yantai Dried Scallops Source Cut Off

Dried scallops such as Yantai goods were sold for 600 yuan last year, only because the output was small and the arrival of goods was cut off for a long time, so the bottom stock in the market has been like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. At present, general demanders all rely on Dong goods, and it is heard that the selling price is 535 yuan for large, unbroken ones, and 520 yuan for the second grade.

### Hardware Huis' Iron Sales Greatly Reduced

Hardware transactions have seemed to be trending towards calmness recently. Most of the gang's merchants have returned to their hometowns for summer vacation, and the factories in this street are also experiencing slow sales due to the hot summer, so the market and people's hearts are also declining. The sales of Huisi iron rely on can factories, printing factories, toy companies, cigarette companies, biscuit companies, etc. in this street. However, although there have been purchases recently, the transaction volume has been sharply reduced compared to the past. Outside ports, such as the Qing-Jin cigarette gang, etc., transportation difficulties and high water feet have greatly threatened the customers, so they also purchase less. It is heard that the asking price in yesterday's market has fallen slightly compared to before, such as old steel mill goods selling for 170 yuan per box, and new steel mill goods selling for 160 yuan per box. Because there are no large buyers, the trend seems to be continuing to decline.

### Situation in Haiphong Has Eased, Shanghai Defense Line Prepares to Resume Navigation, Awaiting Approval from the British Admiralty for Announcement, Coal Loading Ships to Hongji Have Also Arrived Directly, A Section of the Yunnan-Burma Road is Open to Traffic, Foreign Ships Decide to Bay and Carry Goods from Rangoon

The situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam is extremely tense, and Chinese and foreign residents in Hong Kong are evacuating one after another. The Shanghai defense line has been suspended for a time. The sailing ships in South China, Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and Vietnam, Saigon, Hongji, etc., have all been suspended. Recently, because the United States attaches great importance to the situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam, and has a tendency to oppose the actions of the Japanese army, the situation in the two places has eased slightly. It was said yesterday that the Shanghai defense line would resume navigation.

Various Ships Prepare

To resume navigation, Jardine Matheson's Yusheng is scheduled to go to Hong Kong and Haiphong from Shanghai on the 10th. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but did not see it enter the port due to the hurricane until late, and it is expected to arrive at the port this morning, so the sailing period to the defense may be extended to the 11th. Taikoo Company has also dispatched the Qiongzhou Wheel, which is scheduled to resume the Shanghai defense line on the 13th, going to Hong Kong from Shanghai, Bay Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and to Haiphong. Regarding the resumption of the Shanghai defense line, the two companies said yesterday that although

The ships have been dispatched, but they will not be officially announced until the British Admiralty approves them today. The ships going to Hongji from Shanghai to load coal also stopped for a time, but have now resumed. Jardine Matheson's Fusheng Guisheng have been cleared yesterday and are scheduled to export this morning and go straight to Hongji to load coal. M.U. Cingalese Prince of the company's foreign department manager Yitai Company came to Shanghai from Little Luzon yesterday and is scheduled to go to Saigon tomorrow, carrying cargo directly to San Francisco.

Women and Children Going to Hong Kong

The ships on the South China Line to Hong Kong had previously banned the sale of passenger tickets for women and children, because Hong Kong is evacuating women and children, and women and children passengers going to Hong Kong should stop taking the ships. However, starting yesterday, all sailing ships to Hong Kong of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have also resumed carrying women and children and selling passenger tickets for women and children as usual.

River Railway Bridge

The giant railway bridge from Laojie to Hekou was originally the only freight hub from Haiphong to Yunnan Province. Since the French-Japanese agreement was established, the French side has destroyed the bridge, causing all goods to be completely stagnant. The Shanghai transportation agency has stopped receiving freight because passenger cars from Saigon and Haiphong have been suspended, so freight has been completely stopped. Therefore, all goods transported from Shanghai to the southwest inland are changed to be transferred from Ningbo. However, according to passengers who have just arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong, the old street railway bridge connecting Hekou is being repaired.

Yunnan-Burma Opens to Traffic

After Burma became China's only international transportation line, the Yunnan-Burma Highway from Kunming via Dali Tengchong to Lashio has been transformed from the original post road and completed for traffic. The Yunnan-Burma Railway is about to be completed after construction. The highway and railway in Burma connect to a railway to Rangoon for export. From here to Europe, the journey is shortened by 2,500 nautical miles compared to exporting from Hong Kong. The transportation of the Yunnan-Burma Highway is becoming more frequent every day. In addition to the Southwest Highway Transportation Administration to handle highway engineering and transportation management matters,

Handle Porterage

A porterage management office is also set up to handle porterage. At the same time, foreign ships from European countries decided to dock in Rangoon. Various transportation companies plan to handle freight via the Yunnan-Burma Highway. After the Yunnan-Burma Railway is completed, all exports of local goods and imports of foreign goods in China will pass through the road. At present, some foreign ships specialize in shipping goods between Hong Kong and Rangoon. The Yunnan-Burma Road is to open up international thoroughfares, communicate the economy of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, and make the economy of the southwest and northwest a unified whole. Therefore, the blockade around Hong Kong and the suspension of freight transport on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Vietnam to Kunming have no great impact on China's entire international transport.

### US Military Detains Japanese Military Police Case, Japan Actually Protests

During the current third anniversary of Japan's anti-Japanese war, when the two concessions implemented special martial law, Japanese plainclothes military police actually sneaked into the US military defense zone with weapons and were arrested by the US defense forces, totaling sixteen people, and detained in the US military camp. After the Japanese side sent personnel to apologize and take back the arrested people, the matter was over. However, the Japanese military spokesman suddenly claimed at the press conference last night that Consul General Miura would apologize to the US Navy, and announced that the Japanese military authorities were making a strong protest to the US Navy authorities regarding the abuse suffered by the Japanese military police after their arrest.

The US Navy spokesman refused to comment on the matter last night, but hinted that a public statement might be released today.

### German and Italian Nationals Travelling To and From Shanghai and Chongqing Are Being Protected, Counselor Bide Arrives in Shanghai, Special Commissioners Have Been Dispatched to Escort

Since the outbreak of the European War and Italy's involvement in the vortex, it has become extremely difficult for officials and nationals of Germany and Italy to travel between Shanghai and Chongqing via Hong Kong and Haiphong, etc., due to the declaration of war between the two countries. They have all changed their routes to the mainland for round trips. Although the transportation is slightly inconvenient, the journey is still rapid. According to a reporter from Dagang News Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications have recently taken this into consideration and have taken measures to protect nationals of the two countries travelling to and from various provinces in the mainland, and have dispatched special commissioners to accompany and protect them. Recently, Counselor Bide of the German Embassy was escorted by two special commissioners on his way from Chongqing to Shanghai, which was very thoughtful.

### Accountant Dong Chunbiao Died Wrongfully This Morning, Shot by Thugs as He Left His Residence, Three Bullets All Hit Vital Points, He Fell to the Ground and Died Tragically, Chinese Police Bravely Captured the Murderer Wei Gaofa

In the French Concession, 318 Lane, Lafayette Road, that is, the downstairs of the overpass in Yongyu Lane, a shooting occurred suddenly at about 8:05 this morning. The victim was Dong Chunbiao, manager of Daxing Money Shop, who was also an accountant. He was shot three times in vital points and died on the spot. One of the two thugs escaped to the inner door of Ximen Road and was eventually captured by the Chinese police officer of No. 790, who together with another police officer, surrounded and bombarded him. He was shot in the lower abdomen, fell to the ground and was arrested. The details are summarized below:

Dong Tao Co-reside in a Separate House

Dong Chunbiao, a native of Fenghua, is 38 years old this year. He is renting the third floor of No. 6 Yongyu Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession. The second landlord of the house is Tao Leqin, a taxpayer of the Public Concession from Anhui (53 years old), who is the secretary of the Chinese Association. It is a single stone warehouse gate. Tao lives on the second floor and the lower reception room, and the third floor is rented to Dong for a monthly rent of 20 yuan. His wife, Jiang, is 37 years old and has one son and one daughter. Dong is an accountant. Before the war, he co-founded an accounting firm with accountant Jiang Wanping. After the war, he broke away from Jiang. He is now the manager of Daxing Money Shop at No. 264 Jiangxi Road and the accounting director of Datong Business Company at No. 353 on the same road.

Suddenly Hit by Three Shots, Died Instantly

He usually wears a suit, but because of the sweltering heat, he recently changed to Chinese clothes. At about 8:15 this morning, he was wearing a white Indian silk gown, spun silk trousers, white socks and satin shoes, a straw hat and glasses, and walked out of the back door. He had not walked a few steps, and had just arrived downstairs of the overpass, when two thugs were preying on the lane. When they saw him approaching, they drew their guns and shot at him. The sound of gunfire was like a continuous string of pearls. He was hit and fell to the ground, and blood splattered everywhere. One shot hit his nose and penetrated the back of his head, one hit his chest, and one hit his lower abdomen. All were vital points, and he died instantly. At that time, many people were cooling off in the lane, and they fled in panic upon hearing the gunshots, and the order was disrupted.

Chinese Police Bravely Captured One Bandit

After the thugs shot and killed, they quickly ran out of the side door of Yongyu Lane, Lafayette Road, towards Ximen Road. A Chinese police officer from No. 790 at the Malong Road intersection was passing by and followed them. One thug was just entering the back door of No. 17 Ximen Lane when a Chinese police officer (No. 737) standing guard at the intersection of Malong Road and Lafayette Road rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. He bravely rushed into Ximen Lane and surrounded and arrested them together. At that time, the thug saw that the situation was bad and could not advance or retreat, so he quickly drew his gun to resist arrest, trying to break through the encirclement. The two police officers drew their guns and returned fire for self-defense. Both sides fired more than a dozen shots. As a result, one thug was shot in the abdomen and fell to the ground. The two police officers quickly pounced forward, bravely seized the gun from his hand, and surrendered.

The Assassination Target is Someone Else

Later, an ambulance was urgently used to transport him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to the confession, his name is Wei Gaofa, 26 years old, living on Dalishi Bailinan Road, Shanghai West. He directly admitted that he was ordered to assassinate Tao Leqin, the secretary of the "Wanted List of 83 People." However, the injured thug's abdomen was shot, and the injury was not light. The police are now tracking down another thug who is at large. Dong's body was then transported by the police to the mortuary of Talas Tuolu Road for autopsy. The court will send personnel to investigate this morning.

The Deceased Had No Political Activities

According to accounting circles, Dong was extremely loyal, amiable, and approachable in his lifetime. He graduated from the Department of Commerce and Accounting of Fudan University in his youth and had excellent knowledge. This misfortune is a pity. According to another report, the deceased's wife stated to the police that her husband was the manager of Daxing Money Shop at No. 264 Jiangxi Road, and had no enemies in ordinary times, and had never engaged in political activities. According to the confession of the arrested thug, Dong was mistakenly killed, because the person they wanted to assassinate was Tao Leqin, the secretary of the Chinese Association of Taxpayers of the Public Concession, because Tao lived in the same residence as Dong. According to the thug's confession, he now lives in Shanghai West.

### Establishment of a Hygiene Research Institute Near the University of Hong Kong: Construction Cost of 500,000 Yuan, Sir Robert Ho Tung Generously Donates 150,000

The Hong Kong authorities are currently planning to establish a model hygiene research institute near the University of Hong Kong, which will also serve as a training center for public health. The establishment of this institute will bring immense benefits to society and promote the improvement of hygiene in China. It is reported that Sir Robert Ho Tung greatly supports this initiative and has pledged to donate 150,000 yuan towards the construction cost of approximately 500,000 yuan, to help make this great endeavor a reality. It is also said that Sir Robert Ho Tung's generous donation will further deepen the gratitude of the people of Hong Kong towards him, as this is the fourth time Mr. Ho has donated to the University of Hong Kong. In the past, he donated 100,000 yuan for the construction of the mechanical workshop of the engineering school, 50,000 yuan for the establishment of a surgical chair in the medical school, and an additional 110,000 yuan for a foundation. Therefore, including this latest donation of 150,000 yuan, the total amount donated by Mr. Ho Tung to the University of Hong Kong and other institutions has reached 410,000 yuan. As for Mr. Ho Tung's donations to other causes in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, they amount to millions.

### Aluminum Subsidiary Coins Are Minted According to Contract: Inconvenient Packaging and Distribution, Minimum Order of One Bag

The second batch of 50 million aluminum coins, half one-cent and half five-cent, will be minted after the contract is signed and then shipped to Shanghai in batches for distribution, according to the contract. Business guilds and large companies with legitimate needs to requisition the coins can submit written requests to the Joint Reserve Board of Banks. However, the minimum amount for each household is 100 yuan for one-cent coins and 500 yuan for five-cent coins, as each bag of aluminum coins contains 100 yuan of one-cent coins and 500 yuan of five-cent coins.

### Negotiations Regarding Special Police Have Stalled

A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency interviewed Mr. Bowen, the Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, yesterday afternoon to inquire about the truth regarding the special police negotiations. According to Mr. Bowen, as far as he knows, all issues between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side regarding special police and taxation on roads built beyond the settlement boundaries, as well as court matters, have currently stalled and there are no new developments.

### American Lawyer, Lee Chueh-sen, Acts as Executive Officer of the U.S. Court

After the resignation of Mr. Campbell, the executive officer of the U.S. Court for China, the vacant position has been temporarily filled by Mr. Lee Chueh-sen, a renowned local lawyer, appointed by the American Judge Hellmich. This temporary appointment is due to the request of the Department of Justice, so that if there is a vacancy before the U.S. President officially appoints a successor, a suitable person can be found locally to temporarily fill the position and then wait for the government's appointment. Currently, it is difficult to predict whether the President will officially appoint Mr. Lee to the position. However, it is heard that Mr. Lee Chueh-sen is quite unwilling to officially accept the position.

### A Large Number of British Women and Children Leave Hong Kong to Seek Refuge in Shanghai: Also a Significant Number of Chinese, Dutch, and Russians. The General Situation in Hong Kong Seems Peaceful.

The Continental News reports that over 150 foreigners seeking refuge from Hong Kong arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 7th) at 3:00 PM aboard the Japanese ship Kamakura Maru. According to them, Hong Kong has become an armed camp. On the surface, it is still peaceful, but there is an underlying tension, and it is unclear what the future holds. Because residents fear a Japanese blockade, most have left the country.

Those Remaining in Hong Kong Are All Volunteers

The Hong Kong government is only assisting in the evacuation of British dependents. However, Chinese, Dutch, and Russians in Hong Kong are also leaving in large numbers. Those who remain in Hong Kong are all volunteers or are hindered by business and cannot evacuate. It is expected that most of the Russians in Hong Kong will also evacuate soon, with Shanghai as their primary destination.

Some Italians Ordered to Leave the Country

Among the passengers on the Kamakura Maru, there were some Italians who were detained by the Hong Kong authorities when Italy declared war and were then ordered to leave the country. Most of those who arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday were British women and children, as well as some Chinese, Dutch, and Russians.

British Women and Children Mostly Go to Fiji

Also, according to the North-China Daily News, about one hundred British women and children who sought refuge in Shanghai aboard the Kamakura Maru yesterday. It was said that there were originally many more who were scheduled to evacuate to Shanghai, but most changed their plans and sought refuge in Manila. Among those who came to Shanghai were about fifty Italian women whose husbands were detained in Hong Kong.

Extremely Strict Control in Hong Kong

According to a British woman, the situation in Hong Kong seems quite peaceful, but the residents all know that evacuation is necessary, so there are no complaints. The Hong Kong control regulations have been greatly tightened. Even British citizens who relocate must notify the authorities, otherwise they will be severely fined. The Kamakura Maru left Hong Kong on Friday. All British women and children had to leave the country that day. They boarded the ship in a storm, but the journey to Shanghai was calm.

### The French Concession's Method of Increasing Taxes Is Difficult to Change: The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Directors and Committee Members Plan to Petition the French Consul-General.

After the French Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council decided to increase (1) the land tax by one per mille, (2) the house tax by five percent, and (3) the surtax on various license fees and miscellaneous taxes from ten percent to fifty percent, effective July, the residents of the district, unable to bear the burden, requested the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association to negotiate to maintain the status quo. According to a reporter from Dagong News Agency who inquired with the association, the association, at the request of the taxpayers, asked all the Chinese directors and committee members to discuss the matter with the Shanghai Municipal Council. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that the case had already been approved by the board of directors and approved by the consulate, and it was difficult to change it. Therefore, the Chinese directors and committee members plan to petition the French Consul-General again.

Chiang Li-chuan Talks

Chiang Li-chuan, a judge of the Second Special District Court, said that the Shanghai Municipal Council increased the municipal donation and land tax from July 1st to make up for the administrative expenses that were not balanced. The big landlords and the second landlords with abundant income also took the opportunity to increase rents. According to the Civil Law Article 427, the landlord shall bear all taxes and levies on the leased property in the lease contract, regardless of whether it is a fixed-term or indefinite contract. Therefore, the increased taxes and levies should be borne by the landlord. Moreover, the lease contract is a bilateral contract, and the amount of rent has been agreed upon when the contract is concluded. Once agreed, it shall not be changed without the consent of the other party.

Rent Increase Restriction

As for Article 442 of the Civil Law, which stipulates that the parties may petition the court to increase or decrease the rent of real estate due to the rise or fall in its value, it is limited to indefinite leases. For fixed-term leases, rent increases are absolutely not allowed. Even according to the aforementioned legal provision, the prerequisites for increasing the rent of an indefinite lease contract must be based on the increase in the price of the real estate itself, and the parties must petition the court for a ruling. If it meets the conditions for increasing rent, it must be requested from the court, and the court shall determine the increase in proportion to the increase. It is not possible for the landlord to unilaterally notify the rent increase.

Unilateral Rent Increase

In fact, it is common for landlords to notify that the rent will be increased from a certain month and then collect it according to this amount. If the tenant is unwilling to increase the rent and pays the original amount, the landlord will either refuse to accept the original rent or directly use the newly added amount as arrears month by month, as a basis for terminating the lease contract in the future. This is a mistake. It must be known that the reason for terminating the lease contract for arrears of rent must be that the rent is "agreed". The one unilaterally set by the landlord is not agreed. Moreover, the so-called arrears must be deliberately in arrears. If the tenant is unwilling to increase the rent and pays according to the original amount, and is rejected, it is the landlord who has delayed the receipt, and the tenant is not responsible for the arrears.

Legislative Original Purpose

In short, the current civil law of our country is based on the society, and all rights and obligations must be freely exercised under the common interests of the society. The ruling of the judge is also based on this as a reasonable scope. In the past, colleagues in the legal profession have made considerable efforts in this regard to prevent the increasingly dire life of the public. The citizens of Shanghai should also think about the people's livelihood, look forward to the difficulties of the times, share the responsibility of being in the same boat in the storm, and take the righteousness of human coexistence, and encourage themselves to be vigilant and restrain their selfish desires. This is the greatest hope.

### Two American Ships Regularly Sail to Shanghai: USS Chaumont Carrying Replacement Troops, Sailing from San Diego

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, the American transport ship USS Chaumont is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on July 28 from San Diego, carrying troops to replace the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai. The ship will only dock in Shanghai for one day and then go to Qinhuangdao, returning to Shanghai around August 15, stopping briefly before sailing back to the United States. Also, the U.S. Asiatic Fleet destroyer tender USS Black Hawk is expected to arrive in Shanghai on August 20 for a short stay. The rumor that the American ships USS Augusta or USS Marblehead will return to Shanghai at the end of this week has not been confirmed by the U.S. Navy in this city.

### Coal Briquettes Sold at Low Price Starting Tomorrow: Limited to 30 Cents Per Person, Paying for 5 Catties of Coal Briquettes

The Shanghai City Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association held a joint meeting of representatives yesterday and resolved the following important matters: (1) The previous meeting resolved to continue holding the 7th low-price coal briquette sale from the 11th to the 20th of this month. The number of low-price coal briquettes was previously determined by ten factories including Yitai Hing and Nanyang. Now, please have each participating factory list the low-price sale locations on the spot for implementation. It was resolved that forty locations are planned to be set up in the two concessions, and the detailed addresses will be announced after sorting. (2) Regarding the proposal to stipulate the number of coal briquettes to be purchased and the price, it was resolved that each person will still be limited to purchasing 30 cents per day, totaling 5 catties of coal briquettes.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession Shanghai Municipal Council Will Meet Today to Stabilize the People's Food Supply: It Is Expected That the Price Can Be Suppressed After the Production Industry Evaluation. A Large Amount of Imported Rice Arrives, and the Sales Market Relaxes

In order to discuss concrete measures and stabilize the overall people's food supply, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession specifically scheduled to convene a joint meeting with the French Concession Shanghai Municipal Council at 2:30 PM today to discuss concrete measures to stabilize the Shanghai people's food supply, and invited rice industry leaders such as Chen Ziyi to attend the meeting and discuss. It is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Council has discussed the measures to stabilize the Shanghai people's food supply, and after the formal revision and approval, all will be implemented. Therefore, the panic of the people's food supply in this city seems to have been curbed to some extent.

Today's Evaluation

The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee held its first evaluation committee meeting at its office at No. 15 Edward Road at 3:30 PM this afternoon. The committee decided to lower the price of rice and decided to send a letter to the Shanghai People's Food Supply Adjustment Association, requesting it to continue its efforts to handle group purchases of rice, and to promptly forward letters to various organs, groups, and schools to actively participate, and to carry out the rice industry's automatic group purchase of rice to be transported to Shanghai for storage, increasing the inventory.

Association Orders

Since the Shanghai People's Food Supply Adjustment Association convened a standing committee meeting on the 28th of last month to revise the method of ordering imported rice, all parties have been extremely enthusiastic in entrusting the association to order. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the groups that have entrusted the association to order rice in recent days include the rickshaw mutual aid association and the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital. It is expected that the first batch of about 2,000 bags of imported rice can be ordered from Saigon within the next week. However, because the purchasers only pay a deposit of 40 yuan per bag of imported rice, and there are still about 25 yuan of advances, it is bound to be raised by the association. It is estimated that the first batch of rice orders will be about 60,000 bags, so the association is preparing to raise the advance funds. It is heard that the fundraising method is still the same as before, all of which are borrowed by the standing committee members of the association, or borrowed from outside in a private way by the standing committee members. However, the amount of funds this time is not large, so there should be no problem. The imported rice is temporarily limited to secondary rice. Some groups only pay a deposit of 20 yuan, and the association has issued special letters urging them to pay double the deposit, which must be paid in full by the middle of this month at the latest.

Rice Arrives Next Week

In recent days, speculative merchants have used the excuse of tense situation and the difficulty of importing rice as a false statement in an attempt to raise the market price. In fact, the source of imported rice in Hong Kong and other places has been very smooth in recent days. The number of those who can arrive in port next week reaches 69,000 yuan, including 17,000 bags of the Chengdu Wheel, 19,000 bags of the Yingzhou Wheel, 19,000 bags of the Qiongzhou Wheel, and 14,000 bags of the Shandong Wheel.

The average for each province is about 70% of a full year; (2) The preliminary estimate for winter crops is that the area of winter crops has increased due to the government's promotion of winter cultivation, encouragement of increased production, and high prices of agricultural products.

### News Summary

The total number of wood industry raft pullers (those who pole wood rafts) in the city is no less than 2,000. Due to the increasing cost of living and the difficulty in maintaining a livelihood, they sent letters to the Timber Industry Association and various wood merchants yesterday, requesting a 50% salary increase, totaling 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen per day. If there is no result, they will go on strike starting on the 16th.

The Parcel Division of the Postal Administration notified that it has been found that all parcels and large and small packages mailed to Haikou Benkou can now be resumed for acceptance.

The Jianghai Customs announced that when a customs declaration firm changes its business address, it should report to the customs for record three days in advance. If it does not comply, it shall be subject to severe punishment, and its business license shall be temporarily revoked. In addition, customs declaration firms must pay more attention to the fact that all customs declaration forms and stamps printed by customs declaration firms registered with the customs shall not be transferred to any other firms that are not registered with the customs.

According to shipping industry news yesterday, the Japanese ship Daishan Maru was seized by maritime guerrillas in the Liangheng Sea.

### Most of the Resigned Personnel from the Police Department Are Going to Europe to Join the Army: Low-Paid Personnel Are Dissatisfied with the Pension: Long-Term Leave Has Been Cancelled

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, regarding the large number of resignations from the Public Concession Police Department, the Shanghai Municipal Council officials remain silent. However, it is heard that the number of resignations submitted by personnel in the Police Department this year has exceeded 80. According to a police officer, most of the resigned personnel want to

Go to Europe to Join the Army

However, low-ranking personnel in the Police Department said that they are quite dissatisfied with the Shanghai Municipal Council's treatment of pensions. A police officer said that the Shanghai Municipal Council did not explain the pension matters, which shows that the Shanghai Municipal Council

Lacks Trust in Officers

The French Concession Police Department allows police officers to withdraw their pensions, but the Shanghai Municipal Council has not made any statements to the officers. Moreover, the officers are also dissatisfied with long-term leave. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's current restrictions, long-term leave for officers has been cancelled. Those who have reached the vacation period can spend six weeks in the East. This method is indeed not bad, but the Shanghai Municipal Council does not subsidize travel expenses, so those who want to take a vacation must pay their own expenses.

### The Italian Authorities in Shanghai Issue a Racial Discrimination Order: Forbidding Naval and Army Personnel from Interacting with Jews: Not Allowed to Enter Jewish Cafes in Hongkou

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, the Italian racial discrimination order has been extended to Shanghai. The Italian authorities in this city have banned Italian naval and army personnel stationed in Shanghai from entering Jewish cafes in Hongkou, and "unless absolutely necessary and unavoidable," they must not have any commercial dealings with Jews in this city. Italian expatriates in Shanghai received this order at the end of last week. When Italian officials answered reporters' questions, they neither commented on this order nor stated its details. In the past few months, sailors from the Italian gunboats Liburn and Calrotto have been frequenting cafes set up by German Jews in Hongkou, and the business has been booming. However, after the Italian authorities implemented the "racial ban," on Saturday and Sunday last week, cafes set up by Jewish mixed people were

Devoid of Italian Soldiers

So the business was deserted. It is heard that the Italian soldiers stationed in Shanghai now only go to a few places in the southern part of the Public Concession at night. The Italian authorities have designated the Dahua Theater and the Dahua Cafe as places where Italian soldiers can go for entertainment.

### Annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra: Edited and Printed According to the Original Plan: Currently Working Hard on Proofreading

Nothing is more broad and perfect in the Buddha's teaching, reaching the most noble realm, than the Avatamsaka Sutra. This Sutra has greatly influenced the national character of our country, and the annotations written by National Master Qingliang of the Tang Dynasty are even more outstanding among the ancient and modern works on the Avatamsaka Sutra. Unfortunately, there have been no good editions for publication, and it is a matter of regret for those who recite, study, and research it. Layman Xu Weiru once made a great vow to edit and print a complete edition, but he passed away before he could begin. Now, the Venerable Master Yingci, along with Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Mr. Ye Yufu, Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang, and Mr. Fei Youxi, have specially joined forces to take on the task. For a time, domestic and foreign

Avatamsaka Sutra Scholars

Responded from all directions and strongly supported its success. It was originally estimated that 1,000 copies would be finely printed and circulated around the world. Now, the cost of paper and labor is increasing day by day, but they still do not flinch slightly. When the entire book is printed in the future, the actual labor cost will be calculated. The fifth board meeting was convened in this city the day before yesterday. Fei Huimao, Jiang Yizhen, Guan Jiongzhi, Qian Chongzhi, Li Yuanjin, Shi Shengzhi, Xu Chunrong, Meng Wangqu, Yue Jing, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Zhang Zhifang, Yingci, Wu, and Wang Qiumei attended the meeting and reported on the

Active Progress Situation, Very Satisfied All the resolved events, the following is a selection of several important points: (1) The donation received in Tianjin is temporarily stored in the Tianjin Mainland Bank due to the excessive exchange rate at the present time, and will be remitted to Shanghai when needed. (2) The old carved scripture place in Peiping, previously handled by Director Jiang Zhuzhuang, borrowed funds to Songzang Yizhen as a printing copy. It has now agreed to allocate it to this association as a printing copy, that is,

The price of Songzang Yizhen will be used for consignment sales and receipts. (3) There are more than ten kinds of publications for the collation of the Avatamsaka Sutra text and the annotation text of this association. Each layman is responsible for the fine proofreading. Each publication has been compared word by word from beginning to end. If there are differences, further verification and selection will be added, and the meeting will be reorganized. It is expected that the proofreading work can be completed by the end of the year. As for verification and organization, it will not be completed until the end of next year. It was originally intended to be released early, but in accordance with the proofreading example,

Seeking More Excellence

And there are many proofreading copies, due to the early publication, this association has accumulated donations. In addition to allocating typesetting fees, we can first inquire about the prices of handmade Maobian paper from various paper shops or entrust people to inquire in the paper-producing areas. If there is a suitable opportunity, and the original estimated cost is not very different, we will purchase and store it at any time.

### Remittances from Overseas Chinese Increase Significantly After the European War: Remittances for May and June Are About 50 Million Yuan Per Month

Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, remittances from overseas Chinese to the country have increased year by year. According to the authorities in charge of overseas Chinese affairs, the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese to the motherland last year reached 600 million yuan. In addition, from the outbreak of the war until the end of December last year, the relief donations and charitable donations donated by overseas Chinese had reached 124 million yuan, not including the purchase of various government bonds and other special donations. Since the spread of the European War, remittances from overseas Chinese to the country have become more enthusiastic. According to financial circles, remittances from overseas Chinese in May and June recently, which were remitted to the free zone of the motherland via Hong Kong, have been consistently around 50 million yuan per month. Most of them are remitted to major inland cities such as Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and Chengdu for the needs of developing industries and establishing factories. Overseas Chinese have seen that the currency system of foreign countries has changed drastically during the First World War, but investing in the motherland's production industry can not only guarantee safety, but also fulfill the responsibility of the citizens.

### Jianghai Customs Warns Ships: Typhoon Approaching Shanghai; Strong Winds; Fuzhou Already Hit; All Ships to South China Ports Prohibited from Sailing

A Pacific typhoon has begun to strike the Chinese coast. The winds are strong, and the observatory and customs are closely monitoring it. According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry at the Xujiahui Observatory, the Pacific typhoon, after crossing the Taiwan Strait, began to head towards Fuzhou. It reached 25 degrees north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude at six o'clock yesterday morning. The center of the wind force was within 60 nautical miles, and the wind was quite strong, moving rapidly in a west-northwest direction.

Four Wind Forces as Outpost Disturbance

According to the above-reported position, the typhoon is southeast of Fuzhou, about 60 nautical miles away. Therefore, the weather in Fuzhou has been affected by the "wind tongue," with cyclones and rainstorms. According to the observatory's report yesterday morning, there were already four wind forces in Fuzhou, obviously the disturbance of the typhoon's outpost.

Afternoon Report

The observatory issued a second report at 2 p.m., stating that the typhoon had reached 26 degrees north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude. The center of the wind force was within 120 nautical miles. According to the above-reported position, the typhoon has swept past the west of Fuzhou, about 100 nautical miles away, and continued to move in a north-northwest direction.

Shanghai Also Affected by Tentacles

As for this port, there were also strong winds and showers starting yesterday morning. Whether it will be attacked by the typhoon is being closely monitored by the observatory and Jianghai Customs. Ships sailing from Shanghai to various ports in South China have also received warnings from the Customs to suspend sailing. In the afternoon, scattered clouds swept by, and whirlwinds carried rain, stopping and starting intermittently, also affected by the typhoon's tentacles.

Another Typhoon Follows

Finally, according to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry at the Xujiahui Observatory, while a strong typhoon was approaching the Chinese coast, a new typhoon arose in the Pacific Ocean. At 6 a.m. yesterday morning, its position was 12 degrees north latitude and 141 degrees east longitude. The center of the wind force was within 120 nautical miles, heading west-northwest.

### Sailing Schedules Postponed

The new typhoon is approaching the waters off the Ryukyu Islands. According to a report from the observatory received by the Customs yesterday, the current position of the typhoon is 26 degrees north latitude and 118 degrees east longitude, with a wind force of 120. The wind direction is north-northwest. According to those familiar with navigation, the wind force of this new typhoon, 120, is not very strong. If the wind direction does not change and remains north-northwest, this city may not be hit head-on. However, if it deviates slightly to the west, it will be difficult to avoid. Due to the typhoon, the sailing schedules of import and export ships in this city have changed. The Ruitai, a Chinese ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, originally scheduled to depart for Ningbo at 4 p.m. yesterday, has been postponed. Whether it can leave today depends on the wind. The Shantai, of the Zhengde Company, was also scheduled to sail to Ningbo at 4 p.m. yesterday, but due to insufficient loading, it was scheduled to be delayed until about 8 p.m. It is feared that it will only anchor at the mouth of the Huangpu River to wait for the typhoon to pass before sailing to Ningbo. The Yusheng of Jardine Matheson, coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong, was expected to arrive at 4 p.m. yesterday but has now changed to enter the port this morning. The Shengjing of Taikoo & Co., returning to Shanghai from the Beiyang, may not be able to enter the port today. There was no definite news yesterday. All ship schedule changes are automatic, and the Customs has not issued any notifications.

### Robbery on Public Bus

At around 5 a.m. yesterday morning, public bus No. 15021, owned by a British company, had just departed from the company and was carrying passengers westward. Suddenly, two bandits disguised as passengers pulled out pistols, threatening all passengers on the bus and demanding that they hand over their wallets and other valuables, without exception. The bandits then fled the bus with their loot. Since there were not many passengers, the loss was minimal. The Jing'an Temple Police Station is currently dispatching detectives to investigate and arrest the perpetrators.

### Murder and Armed Robbery Gang Sentenced to Heavy Penalties; Prison Terms All Above Ten Years

The French Concession Police received a tip-off at 2 p.m. on March 15th of last year, stating that a large number of Anhui gang bandits were hiding at No. 22 Yuqing Lane, West Xinqiao.

They seized thousands of yuan in cash and a bank deposit book worth 1,000 yuan. However, the main criminals, Zhu Zhenglong and Li Jinzhang, had already escaped upon hearing the news, and the firearms and other weapons had also been moved away, so they were not seized. The French Concession Police conducted an

They were all sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, and public prosecutions were filed against the defendants on charges of murder and robbery. After trial by Judge Zhang Minsheng, Ge Ziyu, Ge Wangshi, Yuan Zhangshi, Li Wangshi, and four others were found to have no involvement and were ordered to be released without prosecution. When questioning the remaining defendants, their statements were evasive. However, the first to fifth defendants were notorious bandits in the Anhui gang, nicknamed "Five Rats." The case was

Visiting the Scenic Huahu Lake

Huahu Lake is a famous scenic spot in Hangzhou. In the past, it was listed as one of the Eighteen Views and was greatly appreciated by the literati and scholars of the time. Tourists were also very numerous for a while. Today, if you ask the people of Hangzhou, few can know its location. However, the villagers outside the city still know it, and they commonly call it "Huahu Li." If you only mention the name of the lake, they will be at a loss. According to its location near Liuxia, the lake is not very large or deep, but it has the beauty of nine bends and thirteen bays. There are many nunneries nearby, more than ten of which are famous, all with clear flowers and bamboos, and quiet waters and rocks. Entering them makes one feel leisurely and want to renounce the world, making it the best place for those who enjoy tranquility and practice Zen. Peng Xueqin, a Vice Minister, was convalescing at West Lake and often indulged in the beauty of the mountains and waters. He would take a bamboo cane and go wherever his fancy took him. On the twenty-third of last month, he invited Huang Wenzong and Yu Zhangjiao to visit Huahu Lake together. For a time, their attendants were unaware of what Huahu Lake was. When they asked the boatmen, they finally learned. The three gentlemen rode together in a small melon-peel boat, rowing towards it. Drifting in the middle of the stream, they felt like immortals. Because the harbor there is winding and winding, the painted boats and larger ships in West Lake cannot enter. The three gentlemen drank wine and composed poetry in the boat. Those who knew them envied them as celestial beings, enjoying clear blessings and leisure, lamenting that they could not reach them. The scenic spot of Huahu Lake has long been forgotten by tourists and has been desolate. Since the visit of the three dignitaries, the people of Hangzhou have talked about its name. This is indeed a great fortune for Huahu Lake!

### The Street Children I Know

— Zhao Zhen

"Save the street children" is not just a slogan, but a very important task that should be carried out in a down-to-earth manner.

Speaking of street children, some people's memories will be evoked with some disgusting faces, ragged clothes, and annoying impressions of crying with their bellies held. But who has ever noticed that many street children, although their faces are full of dirt, cannot hide the naturally adorable and upright contours of their faces; although their clothes are so broken, sometimes their little feet are casually crossed or tapping without any restraint, also reveal the beauty of their upright posture when standing. These are not worthy of our attention, and even more precious is their inner beauty - a beautiful soul. They are not inherently rude and ill-mannered, without a sense of shame, willing to beg for pity, or fond of scolding people. It's just that everything around them has long been destined. Their arrival in the world is not about living, without enjoyment, only suffering, being squeezed to death by the environment - because if there is no luck from heaven falling on their heads, 99 percent of these street children have no hope of "rebirth."

Here I want to introduce some so-called street children, but they no longer evoke your disgusting impression. Adorable, honest, selfless, intelligent, these pure descriptive words are only worthy of describing them. These street children are all those I met in the shelters after the Anti-Japanese War.

First of all, I want to mention Hao. He has a round face, not tall, about twelve years old, and is the most exquisite. He is the best at speaking, and his words are the most vivid. He is the most able to use exaggerated words to describe things, so his words are the most pleasant to listen to. He also has a high-pitched voice. When he sings the Great Sword March "Great sword to...", it is the most exciting, but when he sings "We are all homeless wanderers...", everyone will be deeply moved. He also loves to take a short stick, tilt his head, and act as the conductor of a large chorus. Many times he is adorable.

Gui is a thin, long child. When he smiles, he often reveals his yellow teeth, but this does not make him seem unadorable. He responds the most fluently. I often see him running barefoot in their simple classroom. I ask, "Gui! Why don't you wear shoes?" He answers directly and frankly: "Where are the shoes?" These vanities of pretending to make people happy have not yet entered his mind. He has no parents. In the shelter, he takes care of everything himself. Many times, he also helps others. It is said that he has learned Shenqu in order to make a living in the future.

A Si is an honest child. His honesty can be known just by looking at his face. He likes to talk about family matters, and he likes to say many words of advice to others. When I parted with them, he shed sincere tears several times.

Are these all manifestations of wildness? There are many, many more children who are so good that they just want people to know what the essence of street children is.

Now it is the summer vacation. Junior and senior high school students can make use of the empty school buildings to run summer schools. This is a practical test for those who love education and pedagogy. Not only do street children get the benefits, but also general students can get another kind of knowledge. There are also elementary school teachers who are idle during the summer vacation who can do this work.

If it is just running this kind of volunteer school every year during the summer or winter vacation, I don't think it is very appropriate. There should be some institutions or enthusiastic benefactors who organize it on a large scale. Because what street children lack is not only education, but also the food to maintain life. They cannot receive education without clothes or food on an empty stomach, because people are, after all, people. What street children need is teaching and nurturing! Therefore, only teaching and nurturing can be done simultaneously to save street children.

Short Essay

### Nostalgia for the Sea

— Dongfeng

Like often thinking about friends traveling far away, I often think about the sea of my hometown! The great and solemn soul of the motherland.

But now, my relationship with the sea seems to have exceeded the level of "thinking about it." I can't restrain my excessive concern and love for her, as well as the feelings of distress and worry because of her. It's a sublimation of "thinking about it," like the feeling of a young and passionate child tasting the sweet juice of love for the first time?

In the early red pomegranate flower season, I started dreaming, and it was about [the sea]:

"...Several young people we often run into, after eating the last piece of bread at a picnic, we saw the sea stretching out her hot hand to come over. Her posture was bold and unrestrained, but with some impatience. She kissed those shining and happy shells on the shallows. She also blew that familiar whistle. My friends ran over to welcome her. We received a kiss on her smooth hand, and we embraced her waist warmly. However, surprise occupied everyone's heart. We all felt that she had become thinner, but after a while, we all understood: for three years, her children, her home had been humiliated. She was depressed, anxious, and angry. So she became thinner!"

"Then, we sang a magnificent song in unison; just like we sang three years ago. The sea finally trembled and smiled. She sang with us. Our singing spread to the far, far sea. We heard echoes rushing from the islands..."

Now the pomegranate flowers are old, but my nostalgia will be even more intense! Today, I accidentally passed by the window of a certain company, and I saw a distant view of the seabed, and girls wearing beautiful swimsuits on the shallows. My heart was strongly shaken again. Is this sarcasm? For a child who is nostalgic for the sea but cannot see the sea?

I hope that under the bright moonlight tonight, I will relive a sweet dream of the seabed - reality is bitter, only dreams, you give me comfort.

Self-Cultivation

### Young People

— Liu Jiagan

In the darkness, young people bravely grope, their hands pierced, and their faces scraped. Fresh blood drips down in spots; but the young people do not shrink back. Pain is a precious companion of the young people, and the flower of hope blooms in the hearts of the young people....

The cunning of people once frustrated the hearts of young people. A world is full of hypocrisy and deceit! But young people are immediately encouraged by a new faith: a new world of light and justice is waiting for us young people to create!

Young people have no curses, let alone complaints. The physique of young people is as strong as their will. Young people create their valuable experiences everywhere. They know that experience should be a powerful tool on the journey of life, without which they will not reach the glorious throne of success.

Young people are the happiest people in the world, right? Licentious and dissolute young people should know that they have made a losing transaction, throwing a gem like gravel in a garbage heap!

Do not fail the mission of young people, for young people are the handymen of all work!

### Tempering

— Lei Xing

Night. The electric light suddenly broke. I lit a plain candle. The silent room matched a dim color, with a strange flavor.

The candlelight flickers. Why can't my heart be at peace? Falling into the atmosphere of tranquility, the tentacles of thinking disturb my mood, losing balance.

Life is tempering, but people are often too fragile to endure the torment of emotions. So I ask for an indifferent heart. Reality is cruel, it gives young people a period of suffering and troubled years. So I learn to be cold.

But tonight, I can't control my purple thoughts again.

A friend encountered some misfortune in the world. But he said lightly: "I don't cry or laugh, there is no shame or pride. I use my own shoulders to bear the heavy gate of "fate". In a series of days, people have to grasp the inevitability." I answered him with the greatest praise and admiration.

The electric light came on unexpectedly. The excessive light was a bit dazzling. But people's mood has also brightened a lot.

Life is tempering. The days of fire will eventually forge a strong and unparalleled new generation. I have conviction again.

Hawthorne's Investigation

### The Destiny After the Dance

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 3 Opposing Information

"The earrings?"

"She has several pairs of earrings, a pair of emeralds, a pair of diamonds, and a pair of annual pearl earrings. However, she does not necessarily wear earrings when she goes out."

Hawthorne said, "I believe she must have worn earrings last night."

Jinmei said, "I didn't pay attention to which pair she was wearing."

Ni Jinshou suddenly interjected and asked, "When you first discovered her last night, did she have any jewelry on her hands and ears?"

Jinmei hesitated and said, "I - I didn't think about this, I didn't look closely, probably not. Because since then, no one else has come except Miss Jiang. Later it was this -" Her eyes looked at Ni Jinshou.

Ni Jinshou replied, "Later, I came. Right?...Then, after she came back last night, would she have taken off her jewelry herself?" This last sentence seemed to be asking himself.

Hawthorne suddenly answered automatically: "I don't think so. After she came back, she didn't even change her muddy high heels, so she would never take off her jewelry first. Look, her pair of Huzhi-style slippers were originally under the bench."

Ni Jinshou glanced casually in the direction where I was sitting, and asked Jinmei, "Where is her jewelry kept? We can understand as long as we check it."

Jinmei pointed to the light blue painted iron box. "There is a small jewelry box in this iron box."

Ni Jinshou put in the pencil and leaned his body forward, looking as if he was about to stand up, but unexpectedly, there was a small interruption. (39)

### The Mission of Cinema

— Junmei

Cinema has the mission of exposing sin, praising loyalty and martyrdom, criticizing current affairs, and enlightening knowledge, because the deep emotion of cinema can make sad people happy, and also make happy people sad. It can make irritable people amiable, and also make decadent people invigorated. Directly and indirectly, it has the power to influence society, which cannot be underestimated.

The most reasonable treatment for the mentally ill, according to the statistics of the Hollywood Cinema Reformation Institute in 1936: of 1,987 mentally ill patients, more than 8.2% were completely reformed and cured by cinema. When the police find a mentally ill person or send them to the hospital voluntarily, the Reformation Institute immediately conducts a strict examination, distinguishing between various morbid states such as sexual, ideological, and behavioral, and reforming them according to their morbid state and degree. For example, for those suffering from sexual mental illness, in addition to equipping the ward with various books and models about sex to subtly influence them, they will be shown thirty minutes of films about sexual distress, sexual liberation, and then return to sexual shackles and sexual knowledge before getting up in the morning and before going to bed, so that they can be in contact with it day and night, and soon a kind of corrective force will naturally occur. The power of cinema can reform the mentally ill, and its great mission and its relationship to the interests of society can be imagined.

Therefore, cinema itself cannot lack literature and art. Literature is writing, which is synonymous with beauty. Art is work, which is exquisite technique. Cinema is a tool, and literature and art are the crystallization of intelligence. If there is only shadow without writing, and only skill without art, even if the whole film is made, its emptiness is really equal to blank paper! What's more, how can "folk films" that teach obscenity and evil, and pick up small books and ballads that are only harmful for entertainment be filmed?

Recently, Shanghai film companies have been competing to film so-called "folk films." We sincerely hope that they can truly take on the mission of cinema, and truly pay attention to the function of cinema itself.

### Chaplin's New Film "The Dictator"

— Haixing

— Shanghai Audiences Have No Luck to Appreciate

Charlie Chaplin's new political satire "The Dictator", with German leader Hitler as the subject of the depiction, the film after more than two years of production, has now been fully completed, Chaplin is a world-class artist, his works can grab the largest number of audiences wherever they are screened. But "The Dictator" may be an exception, not because Chaplin's art is insufficient to call, but because the world situation has changed drastically, and some markets cannot screen his works. According to a Mr. who manages Western films, the film will not be able to be screened in Shanghai. Recall that during the conflict between Germany and France in May, "Smashing the Nazi Spy Network" was able to pass in the French Concession. However, today Germany and France are on the same front, and there is no reason to screen "The Dictator". As for the Public Concession, the British and American positions would not prohibit the film, but the Public Concession never takes sides. "Smashing the Nazi Spy Network" is still on the prohibited list, let alone "The Dictator". It is also said that Hollywood has produced several anti-Nazi films, because some filmmakers are either Jewish or sympathetic to Jews, but none of them will be screened in Shanghai.

### Thoughts After Seeing "The Female Innkeeper"

— Qi

In a hotel, live Police Chief Ma Youfu, Tax Bureau Chief Kang Ti, and Regiment Commander Feng Shaohao. The hotel owner, Miss Du Jiu, is a beautiful and charming young woman, very likable. Therefore, those noble figures disregard their status and pursue her. Moreover, they do so fervently and unconsciously, one boasting of power, the other boasting of wealth, as if they have the ideal assurance of winning her favor. But what about her? She just humors them, disliking them all. Among them, Regiment Commander Feng Shaohao, because he never approaches women and even has an impolite attitude towards them, is the one that interests her. She wants to conquer this kind of man, so she uses her clever methods to finally make him waver, bewitched by her magic. As a result, just as conflicts arise among their selfish desires, she announces to them that she is marrying Fan Sheng, a servant in the hotel, because she understands that only she and Fan Sheng are a faithful couple. Finally, she demands that they immediately move out of the hotel.

This is the story of "The Female Innkeeper." Dramatically, the performance of "The Female Innkeeper" is full of humor and satire, like a mirror, reflecting the general truth and falsehood of the old social system.

Tang Ruoying's Du Jiu is fluent and natural in both speech and movement. In the second section of the second act, she uses a psychological sketch to portray the conquest of Feng Shaohao, combining seriousness with humor in a way that is very pleasing. Zhou Chu's Feng Shaohao delivers a foolish performance, which is quite successful. The sections of being bewitched by Du Jiu's false intentions and courtship are performed in a way that enhances the comedic atmosphere. Shao Hua's Ma Youfu seems to be performed as a clown. The various scenes of borrowing money and drinking, although lively, seem unreasonable considering the character's status in the play. Fan's Kang Ti has extremely lifelike facial makeup. The final duel scene is performed quite tightly. The rest, such as Ren Quan's Fan Sheng and Chen Yulin's Wang Er, are all competent.

In summary, we can accept this comedy; however, after it makes us laugh, we must use reason to analyze the intention behind it.

### Wedding News of a Movie Star

— Shawi

"I need to get married!" That's what Hollywood hotshot James Stewart said. Indeed, a young man of his age should get married, and his partners who lived with him have all left to get married, how can James not be envious!

Although his love life has been more extensive than others, with several famous actresses such as Virginia Bruce, Loretta Young, Ginger Rogers, Marlene Dietrich, Norma Shearer, Simone Simon, and Sonja Henie having once been involved with him, none of them can be considered as his life partner. According to James himself, "Although I hope to get married, if a woman doesn't meet my ideal, then I would rather not get married for the rest of my life. Among the many colleagues I know, only Margaret Sullavan is my ideal, but she is already a married woman."

Ah, "a woman like Margaret Sullavan"! James's friends are all paying attention for him. Finally, a friend named Leland Hayward found James's ideal woman, who is the beautiful Olivia de Havilland.

This rapid romance surprised every movie person in Hollywood. After Olivia returned from England, she became even more enthusiastic with James Stewart. James also proposed to her, and she did not refuse. So this wedding is likely to be certain.

"Marriage is the most important thing in life. If I had to choose between career and family, I would unhesitatingly say family." This is what Miss Olivia de Havilland said to one of her close friends. So if anyone objects to her marrying James Stewart, it certainly won't be effective.

### Huaguang Stages "The Beginning of Man"

— Chen Qiu

One often hears literary youths say: "Those who cannot read original works are like infants; when masterpieces are not translated, it's as painful as infants not being fed." Recently, one often hears friends who love drama say: "It would be great to see more foreign plays. Western masterpieces are indeed more perfect in all aspects." Yes, but in Shanghai, it's difficult to see Westerners perform plays. To be honest, there aren't even many translated scripts.

Only a few adapted masterpieces have been popular on stage for a while, such as "Resurrection," "The Investigating Magistrate," "The Beginning of Man," and so on.

"The Beginning of Man" is a masterpiece by Barclay, adapted by Gu Zhongyi. Because the standard is very high, it is not easy to grasp the performance, so it is rarely seen in amateur performances.

Recently, students from Huaguang Drama School have been using the summer vacation to prepare for a public performance of "The Beginning of Man," with the student union in charge of all the work. They are very enthusiastic about their work, which is common for students of the "Drama School." It is said that it has been decided to perform "The Beginning of Man" at the Russian Art Theatre on July 11, directed by Gege, with Chen Mingdong as the stage manager. Because they have a teacher-student relationship with the students of Huaguang, they are also working very hard. It is expected that this public performance will have a considerable degree of success.
