### Victory at Zao Yang, Chinese Army Pursues and Defeats Japanese Troops - Continuing to Recover Tai Ping Lake River Area - High-Ranking Japanese Commanders at Ji Tai Ping Annihilated - Counterattacking Japanese Regiment at Zao Yang Encircled at Hu Yang

Fan City: Japanese troops besieged on the eastern, southern, and northern sides of Zao Yang by Chinese forces, their retreat routes completely cut off, struggled desperately. They regrouped their defeated forces to counterattack the Chinese. Fierce back-and-forth fighting and hand-to-hand combat erupted, leading to unprecedentedly intense street battles in Zao Yang City. A Japanese regiment counterattacking north of Zao Yang was largely encircled by Chinese forces at Hu Yang. Despite putting up a desperate resistance, their high command headquarters at Tai Ping Town had been captured by the Chinese, and high-ranking commanders were annihilated. Japanese troops retreating to Cao Dian were also wiped out by the Chinese, and the Japanese forces trapped at Hu Yang were on the verge of collapse. Over 400 fleeing Japanese vehicles, including supply trucks and over 200 tanks, along the Xiang Hua Road, were unable to retreat as the area east of Tang County Town was entirely cut off by Chinese forces. They retreated into the Da Hong Mountains, where they were intercepted and attacked by the Chinese, suffering over half casualties. Four to five thousand Japanese troops retreating southwest towards Huang Long Dang and Yu Shan are being encircled for annihilation. (18th Dispatch)

Fan City: Over two thousand Japanese soldiers retreating from Zao Yang, finding their passage blocked by the tight Chinese lines at Ma Jia Ji and Yang Jia Peng, took advantage of the Chinese army's westward advance to retreat into the main peak of the Da Hong Mountains, Chang Gang Dian. Chinese forces immediately pursued them to Wang Hu Shan, intercepting and attacking them. From the morning of the 14th to noon on the 15th, the Japanese suffered over half casualties. Another group entered Zhang Jia Ji, gradually gathering over four thousand troops with ten artillery pieces, constructing fortifications for defense and burning civilian houses indiscriminately. However, the Chinese forces, with a resolute determination to die for the cause, launched fierce attacks, battling fiercely for two days and nights, killing five to six hundred Japanese soldiers. On the night of the 16th, the Chinese launched an even more ferocious attack, recapturing Zhong Mai Zhai near Zhang Jia Ji. Another Chinese unit flanked their rear from the side of Zhu Lin Gang. As wind and rain poured down and Japanese planes provided constant support, the Chinese army gradually approached, bravely besieging them. The Japanese forces, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated in disarray towards Yang Jia Dian, leaving behind over a thousand corpses. Sixteen Japanese soldiers were captured alive, along with hundreds of mules, horses, and abundant military supplies. (18th Dispatch)

Fan City: Chinese sweeping forces on the border of Yu and E provinces captured Qi Fang Gang on the afternoon of the 16th, killing many Japanese soldiers and seizing a large amount of supplies and ammunition. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated southeast. Another unit recovered Yang Jia Dang, killing over nine hundred Japanese soldiers. Another unit occupied Hu He, killing over two hundred Japanese soldiers, and capturing four heavy machine guns and over one hundred and fifty rifles. (18th Dispatch)

Fan City: Over a thousand Japanese soldiers retreating from Zao Yang gathered at Xin Ji. On the night of the 14th, the Chinese army took advantage of their disarray to launch a fierce attack, killing over two hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing abundant military supplies. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated towards Shuang He, and the Chinese are in pursuit. (18th Dispatch)

Fan City: Chinese forces reached Yan Dun Dian, west of An Lu, on the night of the 14th, crossing the Yun River and besieging the county seat of An Lu. (17th Dispatch)

Fan City: Since the Chinese forces in Hubei advanced eastward along the Han Yi Road, their progress has been rapid, and their victories have been numerous. On the 14th, they defeated the Japanese who were blocking their advance from Yan Men Kou and Zao Shi. On the afternoon of the 15th, they crossed the Jing Zao Road and engaged in a fierce eight-hour battle from dawn to dusk with Japanese forces coming to meet them at Tang Chi and Jiu Li Gang. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforced with six to seven hundred troops, eight tanks, four artillery pieces, and over ten planes from Ying Cheng and Jing Shan, all of which were repelled by the Chinese, killing over four hundred Japanese soldiers. Including Captain Yano from the Dike unit, who is still engaged in fierce fighting with over six hundred Japanese soldiers at Zhou Jia Wo and Dao Gu Dian. (18th Dispatch)

### He Yingqin Receives Reporters, Reviews the Northern Hubei Campaign - Sun Lianzhong's Troops Were the First to Enter Zao Yang - Japanese Losses Far Exceed Those in the Northern Hunan Campaign

Chongqing: General He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration and Chief of Staff, met with reporters this morning to review the Northern Hubei Campaign. He stated that in early April, the Japanese army began preparations to invade Xiangfan, transferring its 33rd Division from Northern Jiangxi to Eastern Hubei to replace the 39th Division gathered in Sui County. Its 40th Division was transferred to the northwest of Xinyang, and then the 33rd Division was transferred from Eastern Hubei to the Ping Han Road in Xinyang. The 3rd Division, previously stationed on the Ping Han Road, gathered at Changtai Pass (north of Xinyang). The 6th Heavy Artillery Brigade was transferred from Hankou to Xinyang. The 13th Division and the 20th Mixed Brigade gathered at Zhongxiang. In addition, the Japanese side also gathered two artillery brigades, two tank regiments, and two poison gas units to invade, aiming to take Xiangfan and Nanyang with their main force. The right flank or northern route would launch an offensive west of the Da Hong Mountains, attempting to break through the Chinese army's positions and attack Nanyang, then turn south to assist the Japanese forces attacking from Sui County and Zhongxiang, completing the encirclement of the Chinese forces in the Zao Yang area. However, the Chinese forces moved their positions north of the Tang River. Once the Japanese army reached the Tang River, the main force of the Chinese army immediately advanced south. The Chinese forces in the Da Hong Mountains firmly defended their positions, launching fierce attacks on the rear and flanks of the Japanese army as they advanced from Sui County and Zhongxiang to invade the Zao Yang area. The Chinese army was now in a position to encircle the Japanese army. After recapturing Zao Yang on the 16th of this month, they continued to attack the remaining Japanese soldiers in the suburbs of Xinglong Ji and Wu Jia Dian in the southeastern area of Zao Yang, cutting off their retreat routes. The fighting is still ongoing. Although the battle has not yet ended, the victory of the Chinese army is assured. The Japanese army's goal of seizing the three cities of Xiangyang, Fancheng, and Nanyang, and annihilating the defending forces of Zao Yang, has been thwarted by the Chinese army. The Japanese army, which originally planned to encircle the Chinese army, is now instead trapped in the Chinese army's encirclement. The number of Japanese casualties and the loss of war materiel in this battle must be extremely high. Because the fighting is still ongoing, it is impossible to obtain the details, but it can be inferred that it will far exceed the Japanese army's defeat near Changsha in the Northern Hunan Campaign. It is now known that the Chinese forces that first entered Zao Yang were the troops of General Sun Lianzhong, who defended Tai Er Zhuang in the past. Mr. He did not believe that the Japanese army could now gather a large number of reinforcements to Northern Hubei to launch another offensive, and said, "Perhaps they can still gather two brigades as reinforcements." Mr. He emphasized the importance of the Northern Hubei Campaign, saying that the victory of the Chinese army has dealt a serious blow to the Nanjing puppet regime, and made it clear that the combat power of the Chinese army is now growing stronger day by day. Mr. He then answered questions, saying that there are currently 35 Japanese divisions in China. Due to casualties and diseases, each division needs to be replenished with 1,500 soldiers per month. Based on this calculation, regardless of this major battle, Japan must send 40,000 to 50,000 soldiers to China every month to maintain its strength. In the summer months, the number of Japanese soldiers who die from illness will inevitably be more than usual, especially in the Guangxi region, where Japanese troops have been stationed for a long time and have often been attacked by diseases and withdrawn. This can be verified by historical records. Mr. He concluded by saying that the Chinese army's mobile artillery units along the south bank of the Yangtze River have been very active recently. To avoid being bombed, Japanese ships mostly sail at night. (Reuters, 18th)

Editorial

### On Japan's Future, from the Perspective of the Northern Hubei Battle

Beginning in early this month, the Japanese army's seven divisions in the Hubei-Henan border area launched a new offensive westward from Xinyang in Southern Henan and Suixian and Zhongxiang in Northern Hubei. Their goals were likely: (1) to seize the Tongbai Mountain area, a base of the Chinese army; (2) to occupy Xiangfan; (3) if both of the above were achieved, then the Japanese army's position in the Wuhan area could be consolidated, because Xiangfan and Tongbai are strategically located in a controlling position. However, after ten days of fierce fighting, due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army on the front lines and the multi-faceted attacks of the Chinese army on both flanks and rear, the Japanese army's westward offensive ended in complete failure and disorderly retreat. The Chinese army successively captured key locations such as Shuang Gou, Tang County Town, and Changtai Pass, and is now carrying out pursuit operations to encircle and annihilate the remaining Japanese troops. On the 16th, they recovered Zao Yang. Zao Yang is located between the Tongbai and Dahong Mountains and is the gateway to Xiangfan and a major town in Northern Hubei. The fact that the Chinese army was able to recapture it in one fell swoop demonstrates their bravery. Even the Chief of Staff of the Japanese army in China, Itagaki, personally flew to the front line to command, but was unable to reverse the decline. This disastrous defeat of the Japanese army can be considered a complete rout.

If we further observe, it is not difficult to understand that this Japanese army's disastrous defeat in the Hubei-Henan border area is of very significant importance: this is not only a failure of the Japanese army in a corner of Northern Hubei, but also a failure of Japan's basic strategy; it is not only a temporary failure, but also the prelude to an ultimate failure. Originally, Japan's basic strategic principle for the war against China was to swallow the entire China and dominate the Far East. The slogans that Japan loudly proclaimed, whether it was the political "construction of a new order in East Asia", the economic "Japan-Manchuria-China as one", or even the military "close cooperation and joint anti-communism", all served to support this strategic principle of "swallowing the entire China and dominating the Far East". However, because of China's heroic resistance and prolonged resistance, it became impossible for Japan to swallow China in one gulp. Therefore, after Nishio and Itagaki came to China last year, they slightly modified their strategic principle to conduct a "thorough mopping-up of surfaces" in North China, a "linear occupation" in Central China, and a "firm defense of points" in South China. They originally intended to wait until North China was thoroughly "mopped up" before destroying Central China, and after Central China was destroyed, to destroy South China. The above is the basic strategic principle of the Japanese army's invasion of China. As for its specific strategic means, after summarizing and observing, there are no more than four items, namely: (1) fully exploit the advantages of its mechanized equipment, move quickly, and strike first; (2) probe for the weaknesses of the Chinese army on the front lines and implement a central breakthrough; (3) seek shortcuts that can be used on the flanks and implement flanking attacks; (4) make efforts to lure the main force of the Chinese army in order to achieve the goal of a quick war and a quick decision. These four strategic means are almost always used by the Japanese side in every battle.

But time is Japan's great enemy. As the time of the war extends, the objective situation is also changing. Japan's strategic principles and strategic means have to be limited by the new operational environment and constrained by the new international situation, so that its future is becoming increasingly bleak and it is approaching decline. As far as the new operational environment is concerned, the object of the Japanese army's operation, that is, China, its political unity and consolidation, the leapfrog development of construction, the simultaneous improvement of the quality and quantity of the new army, and the calmness and strength of the popular sentiment, are becoming more and more successful after experiencing hardships. All of this was something that the Japanese warlords did not anticipate at the beginning, so that the Japanese warlords' conspiracy to defeat North China, Central China, and South China one by one became impossible, and they had to fight against the entire China, and had to fight against the entire China. In this way, the Japanese army's basic strategic principle of "thorough mopping-up of surfaces in North China, linear occupation in Central China, and firm defense of points in South China" had to be reduced to fantasy. Secondly, on the Japanese side itself, its available manpower, generously estimated, is more than four million people. In addition to the 1.5 million people who have been killed or wounded, there are currently 2 million people fighting and stationed in China. The state of strain of insufficient allocation has long been revealed. Even if the remaining hundreds of thousands or even more than one million people are transferred to China, it is unlikely to improve the current situation. What's more, since the July 7th Incident, Japan's military expenditure for the invasion of China has reached 23,270,000,000 yen, its public debt issuance has exceeded 20,000,000,000 yen, and last year Japan's foreign trade (excluding the so-called "yen bloc") also had an excess of imports of 405,426,000 yen. How can Japan bear these astronomical figures for a long time! In addition, the terrain of China is flat in the east and mountainous in the west. Since the main battlefield has moved westward into the hilly and mountainous areas, the Japanese army's mechanized equipment cannot fully exert its power, and transportation and replenishment are particularly difficult. Because the Japanese army's manpower is insufficient, its attacks often fall into the Chinese army's counter-encirclement and suffer the Chinese army's counter-annihilation. The battle in Northern Hubei in May last year, the battle in Northern Hunan in October, the battle in Guinan in February this year, and even the recent battle in the Hubei-Henan border area, are all the same. However, the Japanese army's losses are probably greater in this recent battle. This further proves that the Japanese army's strategic means are also weakening because they cannot adapt to the new operational environment. As far as the evolution of the international situation is concerned, Japan may celebrate the expansion of the European war, but it can be asserted that the more the European war expands and becomes tense, the more active and tougher the United States' anti-aggression policy towards the Far East will become. Therefore, the United States' expansion of its army and increase in defense is not mainly aimed at the Atlantic, but concentrates its efforts on the Pacific, which is another insurmountable difficulty caused by Japan's armed invasion of China.

In short, Japan's current situation can be said to be in a difficult state of cause and effect, that is, in a circular contradictory state. As far as China is concerned, it is hovering between military aggression and political aggression. After the military operations failed, it turned to reorganization in Nanjing. Obviously, the reorganization of Nanjing could not achieve success, and then it launched the battle in Northern Hubei, which also ended in a disastrous defeat. As far as foreign affairs are concerned, the time when the Japanese warlords failed in their invasion of China was also the day when Arita loudly advocated southward advance, which increasingly aroused the United States' resentment, that is, it increasingly increased the difficulty of Japan's invasion of China. This kind of cycle continues and contradictions increase day by day. Can Japan's future have a glimmer of hope? The defeat in Northern Hubei is only the prelude to its accelerated collapse.

### The Fall of Brussels to German Forces Yesterday; Western Front Battles Reach a Critical Stage; German Advance Less Than 100 Miles from Paris; Change of French Frontline Commander Favors Counteroffensive; Allied Forces in Belgium Retreat Westward from Brussels

Paris - According to reliable sources, the situation on the Western Front this morning can be summarized in three aspects: (1) In the central region, south of the Sambre River, the German army deployed most of its tanks, totaling 2,500 to 3,000, in a fierce assault on our forces. Judging by the enemy's strategy, they intended to break through the French lines with this tank force to achieve a quick victory. Therefore, yesterday, they repeatedly attacked the areas of Hirson, Avesnes, and Vervins, with vehicles clashing and surging like a tide. As a result, although they made some progress in the Avesnes area, our forces, after several counterattacks, have achieved local victories. In the Vervins area, fierce fighting between the two armies is ongoing. Although the enemy also made some progress, they were ultimately blocked by our tank forces. Considering the battles in these areas, our army has more artillery and can concentrate firepower to bombard the German tank forces. The air force is also assisting from the sky, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. In addition, a large number of British and French bombers and fighter planes are concentrated in the triangle formed by the cities of Le Cateau, Vervins, and Avesnes, bombing enemy communication lines day and night. Thousands of tons of bombs have been dropped, and millions of machine gun bullets have been fired. Therefore, the German tank force's advance has been very difficult. As of this morning, a major battle has erupted again. In addition to the frontal assault, the enemy is also pressing from the left and right flanks, but with less force than on the front. (2) In the southern region, on the line from Sedan to Montmédy, the enemy's offensive has stalled after being fiercely attacked head-on by our forces. (3) In the northern region, within Belgium, north of the Sambre River, the British and Belgian Allied forces had blocked the enemy on the line of the Dyle River, east of the Belgian capital, on the previous night and yesterday. Now, for strategic reasons, they have retreated west of Brussels, and consequently, the cities of Brussels and Leuven (Louvain) have successively fallen. Overall, although the enemy's offensive has made some progress, they have encountered extreme difficulties everywhere. (Havas, 18th)

Paris - The powerful German blitzkrieg is now in its ninth day and continues to advance. The German advance has now reached a point only ninety miles from Paris. The war has now reached a critical stage, but the Allied forces are still putting up a desperate resistance. (Associated Press, 18th)

London - The northeastern French army, which is responsible for containing the German offensive, is now under the command of General Giraud, who previously served as the garrison commander of Metz and is currently a member of the Supreme Military Council. He enjoys a distinguished reputation in both England and France, and British authorities have expressed great satisfaction upon hearing the news. (Havas, 18th)

Paris - Today, the German attempt to advance into France seems to have been thwarted, as French forces launched a mechanized counteroffensive in the area around Saint-Quentin and Le Cateau, engaging in fierce combat with a large part of the German mechanized units, causing the German offensive to falter. Intense fighting is still ongoing, but French military circles claim that the Germans have indeed gradually retreated. According to military observers, although the German land and air forces launched relentless attacks last night and yesterday, the French positions have actually advanced this morning. (Associated Press, 18th)

London - According to the General Headquarters' communique and frontline reports, we are now in a major melee. The fighting is extremely fierce, and the overall situation is very serious, but it is by no means collapsing. A French government spokesman stated today that the General Headquarters remains calm in its decisions. We can only have full confidence in the commanders and the entire army and await the outcome. The retreat of the British and Belgian armies to positions west of Brussels was deliberate and purely for strategic reasons, completed without being seriously hampered by the enemy. In yesterday's major armored vehicle attack between the Sambre and Lys rivers, the Germans used at least half, or perhaps more, of their armored vehicle forces. Two to three thousand German tanks attacked in two directions: northward towards Avesnes and southward towards Vervins and the vicinity of Hirson. The fighting was extremely fierce. Although we lost some ground, our army has become accustomed to tank attacks and is not afraid. It counterattacks whenever possible and achieves considerable results. Therefore, this battle cannot be considered a failure. Further south, near Vervins, the enemy made an even more forceful advance. This battle ended at a position that had been selected by the Allied General Headquarters early on. There, French armored vehicles encountered German armored vehicles, and the French troops retreated in good order. (Reuters, 18th)

Berlin - The German High Command declared, "German forces besieging Leuven have occupied the city today. The British and French positions south of Leuven have also been broken through. German forces entered the Belgian capital, Brussels, tonight." (Haitong, 17th)

Bern, Switzerland - The German semi-official agency, the German News Agency, recently issued a communique from the German High Command stating, "German forces broke through the British and French positions south of Leuven late tonight and attacked the Belgian capital, Brussels. The Belgian government moved elsewhere yesterday." The communique also stated, "German forces broke through the Dyle River line north of Leuven and occupied the city of Mechelen." It also reported that "The city of Leuven has fallen to German forces after a period of intense fighting." (Havas, 17th)

Paris - The General Headquarters issued a battle report this morning stating that, within our country, our and the enemy are continuing to fight fiercely in the positions mentioned in yesterday's battle report (i.e., the northern city of Avesnes, the city of Vervins, and the northwest of the city of Le Cateau). In Belgium, the Allied forces, in light of the overall situation, have implemented a retreat and are defending positions west of Brussels. Our aircraft attacked enemy positions and communications at night. (Havas, 18th)

London - Reliable sources stated last night that the German motorized units launched a fierce attack northwest of Mechelen yesterday, apparently attempting to threaten the Allied forces' communications in Belgium. According to authoritative observations, the military situation in France has become very serious. However, the Allied forces still have complete confidence in overcoming the difficulties. One military observer believes that, given the intensity of the war, the German claim that they have captured more than 12,000 people is not entirely unreasonable. According to authoritative sources, the German forces attacking in Mechelen have caused some Allied units, which were previously defending east of Brussels, to withdraw from the Belgian front line. It is reported that the German forces are attacking in the Paris area with tank units, each with 400 tanks, totaling two or three units. In Belgium, there are one or two tank units in operation. In total, the German tank force in the west has eight units. (Associated Press, 18th)

German Forces Advance from Breakthrough Point, Spreading Out in a Fan Shape to the North and South. Berlin - German Supreme Headquarters information states that German forces have broken through data points on the Maginot Line, along one hundred kilometers from Maubeuge to Carignan. The information states, "France's impregnable defense line, which guards its eastern front, has now been breached." Well-informed neutral military circles here call the breakthrough of the Allied lines an "unstable achievement of German force" and do not believe this is the beginning of a decisive battle on the Western Front. They suggest that Germany may attempt a large arc-shaped encirclement towards the English Channel in the north. German newspapers report that German troops are surging across the breached 100-mile defensive line in all directions, fanning out to the northwest and southeast in an attempt to widen their breakthrough point. The German press reports that German bombers are dropping large quantities of highly incendiary bombs on British and French rear units and Allied railways and highways. If the French counterattacks on the flanks of the German forces are unsuccessful, the Allied forces in northern Belgium and northeastern France will be in a desperate situation. German forces can counterattack from the rear and press towards the Dyle River line. German forces, attacking from Liege and Maastricht towards that line, have breached a stronghold south of Wavre. (Associated Press, 18th)

Paris - According to reports from frontline military observers, a large-scale "war of movement" has begun in central Belgium and northern France, gradually expanding its scope. The German motorized units, assisted by the air force, are making fan-shaped advances in all directions and have indeed made progress. Small tank units have penetrated deep into enemy territory, too far from their bases, and have been quickly annihilated by the Allied forces. The Allied forces are now paying attention to the German motorized units that have lost contact with their bases and are launching counterattacks on their flanks. The French army is now holding positions between the Scheldt River (i.e., the Escaut River) and the Sambre River, and British aircraft have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy's motorized units. (Havas, 17th)

General Gamelin Urges Soldiers: "Rather Die in Battle Than Abandon an Inch of Territory"

Paris - General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, issued an order to encourage all soldiers, with poignant words, saying, "The war has already begun. This war is truly related to the fate of our country, our allies, and the entire world. The armies of England, Belgium, and Poland, as well as foreign volunteers, are fighting alongside us. The British Air Force is also engaging the enemy planes with all its might, just like our air force. All our soldiers bear the heavy responsibility of defending the country's territory. If you cannot advance, rather die in battle. You must never abandon an inch of territory. According to our country's history, whenever we face a major crisis, we can only abide by one maxim: 'Either victory or death.' I believe we will surely achieve final victory." (Havas, 17th)

German Offensive Avoids Key Points, Resulting in the Loss of France's Northeastern Barrier

Paris - According to various military experts, the Maginot Line originally ended at the city of Montmédy, which is thirty kilometers east of the city of Sedan. The German army never attempted to attack it, wanting to avoid key points, so it did not hesitate to go this way to find weaker points in the French border defense. This kind of thinking has become clear. Furthermore, the German strategy is to seek a quick victory at any cost, while the French army maintains good discipline on one hand and responds with calm and composure on the other. (Havas, 18th)

Berlin - According to an official German report released last night, the last line of defense of the British and French armies in Belgium, the Dyle Line, has been broken through by German forces. The speed of the German advance has greatly exceeded British and French expectations. The British and French positions in Antwerp have also been greatly shaken as a result. In the Netherlands, German forces are continuing to clear out the remaining enemy forces on the islands, but this is no longer as important compared to the battles in Belgium. On the French side, German forces have broken through the Maginot Line, crossing the Meuse River and breaking through the 100-kilometer line from south of Maubeuge to southeast of Montmédy. The eastern barrier of France is now no longer impenetrable. German forces are pursuing and capturing fleeing French prisoners in that area, totaling 12,000 people, including two generals. Yesterday, the German air force bombed enemy transport vehicles, railway stations, and ammunition depots, all with remarkable effect. Fifty-eight enemy planes were shot down in aerial combat.

Zeeland Islands Garrison Withdraws, All of the Netherlands Falls Under German Control

London - After the islands of Walcheren and Beveland in the Dutch province of Zeeland were repeatedly bombed by German planes, the French Marines originally stationed on the islands were withdrawn with the agreement of the French commander and the Dutch military authorities. Fierce fighting took place at the mouth of the Scheldt River (i.e., the Escaut River) in Zeeland Province. Military facilities of value there, such as the docks, gasoline pools, and shipyards in the port of Vlissingen on Walcheren Island, have been completely destroyed by Dutch troops to prevent them from being used by the enemy. Furthermore, all faculty and students of the Dansa Aviation School on the island have flown to British and French air bases in training aircraft. (Havas, 17th)

Paris - The State Council recently issued a bulletin stating that General Pétain, the French ambassador to Spain, returned to this city from Madrid today. He was received by Premier and Foreign Minister Reynaud, who immediately invited him to join the cabinet as an associate minister without portfolio. He has already indicated his acceptance. In addition, it is necessary to concentrate power in politics and military affairs during the current war. This has been proven by the recent battles. Therefore, Premier Reynaud has, with the consent of Minister of National Defense and Minister of War Daladier, concurrently assumed the positions of Minister of National Defense and Minister of War, while Daladier has taken over the position of Foreign Minister. Furthermore, Minister of the Interior Roy has resigned, and his vacancy has been filled by Minister of Colonies Mandel.

### Fierce Aerial Battles in French Airspace

London - British Hurricane fighter squadrons engaged German Junkers bomber squadrons in French airspace yesterday and shot down seven German planes. The details are as follows: At the time, the British squadrons spotted 20 enemy bombers circling over a forest in France. They immediately divided into three teams. One attacked from high altitude, while the other two patrolled in the upper air, preparing to intercept. The German fighter squadron then saw that the enemy bomber squadrons did not have fighter escorts and immediately joined the aerial battle, ultimately shooting down nine enemy planes. Later, on the return journey, they encountered a German plane and shot it down as well, and then safely flew back to their base. (Havas, 18th)

### British Planes Bomb Germany, Disrupting Military Communications and Inflicting Heavy Damage on Advancing German Troops; German Planes Fail to Attack British Airfields

London - According to an official announcement, on Thursday night, British Air Force bomber units again attacked military targets in western Germany, scoring several direct hits. The aircraft participating in this air raid were all medium bombers. Enemy transport vehicles and gasoline depots around Sedan were bombed, and several fires broke out. On Thursday, the enemy's repeated fierce attacks in the Meuse River valley were met with attacks by the British Air Force, which destroyed pontoon bridges, blocked roads, and dropped bombs and opened machine gun fire on advancing enemy troops. Enemy troops in important locations were hampered, and their mechanized units suffered heavy damage. Yesterday, the Air Force was quite active in the British sector, and bombers repeatedly and fiercely attacked enemy mechanized columns. Although the enemy had strong fighter squadrons assisting their advance, our bombers still flew low to attack and inflicted heavy damage on them. Lysander fighter planes, which were assisting the French army in combat, encountered a large number of enemy planes and anti-aircraft fire when attacking important positions in Gembloux. At dawn, British fighter planes intercepted nine German Stuka bombers heading to attack British airfields, shooting down two and forcing the rest to flee. When German planes bombed another city defended by the British Air Force, three more were shot down. In the past two days, light anti-aircraft batteries defending British airfields have shot down at least ten enemy planes. The German High Command announced yesterday that the Allied forces had lost 1,462 aircraft. However, this was a mistake in publishing their own losses. In reality, the Allied losses are only a small portion of what the Germans have claimed. However, although the German Air Force has suffered such heavy losses, their reserves are still sufficient and will be able to maintain their efforts for some time to come. (Reuters, 18th)

He added that many families had been destroyed, dispersed, or broken, and many people had to endure future hardships due to the destruction of their homes.

Our duty lies in defending Western civilization until true peace is restored. Our attitude is to maintain neutrality and live peacefully with other countries while also resolutely defending our new world and all cultural systems. This attitude should be known to the world. In terms of international relations, it is not enough for the interests of governments to align; the peoples of all countries must recognize the value of working together towards common goals to be effective." He concluded by saying, "The United States has received great gifts from the Old World, which is a real situation. However, if the current war continues, it will cause various changes in Europe.

Responsible sources here stated directly that one thing is quite gratifying: there are signs of a more peaceful tendency on the Italian side.

### Italy's Attitude Still Hesitant: No Change in Mediterranean Situation, U.S. President's Telegram Being Studied Carefully, Britain Plans to Revise Naval Inspection Methods

Rome – Diplomatic circles here recently stated that there has been no change in the Mediterranean situation, but there is a slight tendency for it to escalate. The recent alarms were all due to fantasy, and nothing unexpected is likely to happen, at least in the next week. Although the Italian Navy can be mobilized immediately in a few hours, the Army still needs some time for deployment in order to maximize its power. The pressure that Germany is currently putting on Belgium and France is not pleasing to Italian public opinion, contrary to the views of certain newspapers. Some Italian observers have begun to feel that their country will also be threatened by Germany one day. (Havas, 17th)

London – Political circles here recently stated that the Italian issue is currently only of secondary importance. Although the country's attitude has not softened by last night, it has at least become hesitant. In addition, the British government is currently drafting a plan to revise the current naval inspection methods to make their implementation more flexible, or even to avoid implementing them in the Mediterranean, to avoid causing displeasure to neutral countries, especially Italy. Italian newspapers have recently used this blockade method as an excuse to criticize Britain and France for hindering their freedom of trade. If these statements are only aimed at opposing the inspection and are not an excuse for the country to prepare for war, then once the British government adopts a sincere attitude, the relations between Britain and Italy will immediately improve, without a doubt. However, on the other hand, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's recent speech was not encouraging. In general, the ultimate key to Italy's attitude towards the current European war depends on how Italian Prime Minister Mussolini judges the state of Germany's victory and the "degree of readiness" of domestic public opinion. In short, Prime Minister Mussolini does not seem likely to make any decision until he is absolutely sure. However, although the country has not made this final decision at this moment, Britain and France must still take maximum precautionary measures in the Mediterranean and must not be negligent. In short, Britain's current attitude has not changed and will not do anything to worsen relations between Britain and Italy, but at the same time, it is also prepared to deal with any unexpected events. That is all. (Havas, 17th)

Rome – The Giornale d'Italia recently used the alleged arrest of Maltese as an excuse to criticize "Britain's tyranny," saying that Britain rules Malta under martial law and that the situation there is "very serious." (Reuters, 18th)

Rome – Official sources claim that President Roosevelt's telegram to Mussolini is currently being "carefully studied." However, because the telegram is of a private nature, no information can be provided about its contents, and it is too early to predict what the Prime Minister's response will be. At the same time, the number of political observers who firmly believe that Italy will remain non-combatant is decreasing day by day. Train tickets to the border are fully booked for British and French nationals. The national demonstration scheduled for next Sunday is currently being prepared. The Fascist weekly review, edited by Italian Education Minister Bottai, said, "Britain's hegemony in the Mediterranean is intolerable. We must solve this problem, or we will miss the opportunity." (Reuters, 18th)

### Roosevelt Proposes Building 50,000 Airplanes: Requests Emergency Defense Funds, Both Houses Prepare to Enact Legislation

Washington – The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives began yesterday to prepare to quickly enact legislation for President Roosevelt's request for $1,800,000,000 in emergency defense funds. Some Congressional leaders claimed that the bill would be ready next week for the President to sign. The President's request will increase defense spending for the next fiscal year, starting July 1, to $3,000,000,000. This funding will cost each American $25. This increase in funding is only the beginning, as President Roosevelt proposed building 50,000 airplanes. Yesterday, the President told reporters that the government would build aircraft factories to help private aircraft factories quickly build 50,000 airplanes annually because of the urgency of the European war. The President canceled his plans to return to Hyde Park this weekend and travel to the western United States. The White House received hundreds of telegrams yesterday supporting the plan to build 50,000 airplanes. Military experts estimate that it will take two and a half years to build 50,000 airplanes. Army and Navy officials are currently planning to build 20,000 Army airplanes and 1,000 Navy airplanes first. Military officials admitted that training pilots is a major problem. Military experts refused to estimate the cost of 50,000 airplanes. The new airplanes will be known for their speed, maneuverability, and range, and will include various advantages of German airplanes. (Associated Press, 18th)

Washington – It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's defense proposal is only the beginning. According to some political observers, Treasury officials are now discussing privately increasing defense spending by $10 billion before 1942. As newspapers began criticizing the passage of the new defense program in Congress, they were busy warning the national public that this new armament spending must be paid for. The most common fundraising suggestion is to greatly increase income taxes. (Reuters, 17th)

Washington – The House Army Committee is currently studying how to submit legislation to Congress in a short period of time to implement the expansion plan based on President Roosevelt's defense message yesterday. Army Department representative General Cassel recently submitted a bill to the committee, advocating the repeal of the current law restricting the Army to no more than 6,000 airplanes. (Havas, 17th)

Washington – President Roosevelt recently gave a speech to the press, stating, "I originally intended to tour the western regions after Congress adjourned, but I have now abandoned that plan. I have discussed the development of airplane manufacturing with experts, and I especially focus on the government assisting the various aircraft factories. In the Navy, the 35 destroyers that participated in the last war have been disarmed, and we plan to re-equip them with weapons and incorporate them into the fleet. In short, the number of factories producing airplanes and anti-aircraft guns should be increased, and these factories should be distributed in various places. In addition, the production of various components should be increased, and the training of skilled workers should be facilitated. Oil refineries should also be added. The government should establish a special agency to guarantee and support the major rearmament program of President Roosevelt. Many believe that their support for President Roosevelt's program has formed an unparalleled defense alliance." (Reuters, 18th)

### By the Xue Tao Well of the Tang Dynasty - Gold Digging Continues at Jin River (Continued) - Zhang Xianzhong Buried Tens of Thousands in Gold Under the Jin River - Scientific Methods are Now Being Used to Excavate Near Wangjiang Tower

On May 2nd, behind Stone Ox Ridge, more than seventy stone bars were excavated, many still bearing inscriptions and the symbol "(一)." Beneath the stone bars were countless layers of horizontally laid, decayed wood. Further below, several Da Shun coins, cast by Zhang Xianzhong, were unearthed. This is the seventh minor sign.

Two months after starting work last year on this very day, so many indications have been discovered that it is not without reason that the company's records are credible, and the public, upon hearing of it, cannot but be excited.

Scientific Proof

Though the results of last spring's work yielded many signs, whether or not treasure lies beneath the sandbar remains a mystery. What scientific method could be used to prove it? During the ten months of suspension, the company concentrated all its efforts on resolving this question. Should they try a drilling rig? The work site is conveniently located in the river's center, where the geological stratum is all sand and gravel, making the use of a drilling rig quite difficult. Finally, it was decided to use a wireless gold detector to prospect for metal deposits. Last autumn, they hired three mining experts, Xu Weili, Zhang Zhonghua, and Liu Fubo, to oversee production in Chengdu. After several months of work, the gold detector was finally made.

With the gold detector made, the question of the instrument's accuracy is worthy of note. To test the effectiveness of the gold detector, the company's representatives and the three experts contacted Chengdu Qiming Electric Company to test the underground cables of the electric company. The results were very satisfactory. The course of the underground cables was completely mapped out by this gold detector.

The gold detector is made according to the principle of wireless radio balance. It utilizes a directional antenna transmitter and a directional antenna receiver. It is adjusted in a non-metallic area until no sound is heard (i.e., the balanced position). The relative positions of the transmitter and receiver are fixed. In a metallic area, the balance is lost due to the metal reflecting radio waves, and the receiver emits a bell-like ringing sound.

Starting in January this spring, exploration of the sandbar began. There were indeed metal reactions, all of which were man-made geometric shapes, covering an area of one hundred square zhang. There are also many scattered, small pieces of metal. The depth of burial and what kind of metal remains to be judged.

One day, they were playing around with the gold detector at the work site and suddenly discovered a circular metal response. Inside and outside the circle, however, there was no reaction. The circle's diameter was one and a half city feet. Driven by curiosity, they began to dig. At a depth of four feet, they suddenly discovered a headless, bottomless tin basin. After removing the tin basin, they used the detector again and found no response. To this day, the company's employees consider this a charming tale.

Continuing the Excavation

By Xue Tao's well near Wangjiang Tower, the project, imbued with the rich flavor of ancient charm and surrounded by the scientific atmosphere of the sound of motors, continues under the rippling spring breeze. It is believed that the stone oxen and stone drums unearthed last year on the sandbar, which is thought to hold boundless treasures, are still silently facing each other from afar. The right ear of the stone ox has been broken off, it is unknown by whom. Half of the broken ear is abandoned on the ox's back. The withered bones, stone bars, and the remains of the tin basin detected by the gold detector are piled up in a sandy corner for people to visit. Legend has it that when Zhang Xianzhong buried the gold, he cut off the river's flow. Although gold digging has not cut off the river now, it is being diverted. The river originally flowed along the right bank of the sandbar, but it has now been cut off, forcing it to flow down the left bank. The soil dug up for gold digging is used to build high dikes along the bank, so that work can continue as usual even during periods of high water.

In the center of the sandbar, a large wooden barrel towers, connected below to a reinforced concrete barrel. The concrete barrel is deeply embedded in the ground. The wooden barrel has a diameter of more than one zhang. Climbing up the ladder and looking down into the barrel, several workers are digging sand and mud at the bottom. The water that seeps in is drained into the river by motor pumps. By the end of April, the depth of the shaft-like excavation had reached over one zhang. The results of the gold detector's exploration show that the response here is the greatest, so it has been decided to continue digging down to five or six zhang, and then decide what to do based on the situation. Last spring's construction site is no more than three zhang away from the sinking barrel. Digging has now started there as well. The old method is still being used to drain water with dragon bone water lifters. The workers happily tread the wheels, diverting the seeping water, their songs floating on the river, leisurely and serene, simple and happy.

From time to time, people come here to visit. Chairman Lin and Minister Chen Cheng have both visited. The overseas Chinese repatriation delegation also came to visit on the evening of May 3rd. MGM Studios of America specially sent photographer Wang Xiaoting to Chengdu to film the gold digging. The Jin River gold digging project has indeed become famous at home and abroad, but whether or not gold can be dug up here remains to be proven by facts. However, the company's spirit of "seeking what can be sought, and not ceasing to know what cannot be done" is truly admirable. (May 3rd) (End)

### Xiucai Discovers Ancient Tomb Outside Wujin East Gate - Zhao Zhuangyuan's Corpse in Disarray - Precious Funeral Objects All Stolen

Changzhou Communication, due to the hardships of the people in the countryside of Wujin, unemployed vagrants often engage in tomb robbing. Turning over corpses and smashing bones, even the spirits of the deceased in the underworld cannot rest in peace. On the 7th of this month, there was an ancient tomb in Hejia Village, Huangtang Township, outside the East Gate, which was buried in the sixtieth year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, 220 years ago. The coffin buried was that of Zhao Xiongzhao, a native of the county, a jinshi who ranked fifty-seventh in the Shuntian provincial examination in the year of Ji Mao during the Kangxi reign, and ranked first in the palace examination, personally appointed as Zhuangyuan and conferred the title of compiler in the Hanlin Academy. His morals and articles were unmatched for a time, but unexpectedly he was also exhumed by villains. The precious funeral objects in the coffin were all stolen, boots and hats were in disarray, and the corpse lay naked on the grass. The skin was wrinkled and withered. It had not decayed in hundreds of years, with white whiskers a foot long and deeply sunken eyes. Due to exposure to sunlight, the corpse had turned black. After the tomb-keeping villagers reported to his descendants, Zhao Minxuan, he went to the village to re-coffin and bury it.

### Defense Forces of Warring Nations Stationed in China Decide to Maintain the Status Quo in Central China; Inspector General of Customs Robert Hart Reaches Decision Through Consultations with Commanders of Various Nations; Italy's Participation in the War Is Unrelated to the Situation in Shanghai

The situation in Europe is currently becoming increasingly severe. At the same time, Italy in the Mediterranean is poised for action, with tensions running high. According to various signs, it seems Italy is leaning towards the Nazi side, and declaring war is imminent. Italy has a marine corps stationed in Shanghai, with its defense area in the western district of the International Settlement along Robison Road, adjacent to the British defense forces along Great Western Road. To the south are the French defense forces of the French Concession. If Italy joins Germany in fighting against Britain and France, the situation for the European defense forces in this port will inevitably become very serious. Regarding this, it is learned that the leaders of the various national defense forces here have made proper arrangements. It was only yesterday that it was announced by foreign sources.

Defense Forces of Various Nations Hold Important Consultations

On the 7th of this month, Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, invited the commanders of the defense forces of various European nations stationed in Central China for exploratory talks. A unanimous agreement was reached that even if the European war situation were to further expand and affect the home countries of these troops, the status quo here should be maintained. This agreement also applies to the defense forces of various nations stationed in North China. Therefore, even if the European situation deteriorates further, there is no need to worry about the situation in this port, especially with the United States acting as an intermediary to arbitrate everything, the future can naturally be smooth and worry-free.

According to the English-language *China Press*, it was announced today (the 18th) that Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, held an inquiry-based meeting with the commanders of the European forces stationed in Central China on the 7th of this month. All the commanders quickly agreed that when the European war continued to expand and affect their home countries, they would, to the best of their ability, maintain the peaceful status quo of the troops stationed in Central and North China.

Newspaper Records Engage in Extensive Provocation

However, the Japanese side in this port is adopting a wait-and-see attitude, believing that the development of the situation is extremely serious. The Japanese-language *Continental Daily News*, which is usually regarded as the mouthpiece of the Japanese military in Central China, published an article yesterday morning regarding this matter. One point stated that even if the leaders of the defense forces of various nations in Shanghai had reached an agreement, there was still the possibility of "unexpected incidents" occurring involving the defense forces of the warring nations here. The second point stated that the foreign defense authorities, diplomatic circles, and foreign trading companies here were paying close attention to Italy's movements, and they strongly believed in Germany's powerful offensive on the European front. The wording was intimidating throughout. Examining its intention, it seems to be the same as last September, when the European war broke out, and the Japanese government immediately requested that the European belligerent nations withdraw their troops stationed in China (the Japanese-occupied areas) to avoid conflict. At that time, the British and French sides refused, pointing out that Germany had no troops stationed in China, so there would be no conflict. As for future developments, thanks to the foresight of U.S. Admiral Hepburn, who took precautions and solemnly obtained a unanimous guarantee from the leaders of the defense forces of various European nations to maintain the status quo, even if the situation in the Mediterranean deteriorated, the Japanese side would have no excuse to change the status quo of the defense forces in the Shanghai concessions.

French Municipal Council Remits Funds to Motherland

The French Municipal Council of the French Concession has recently decided to purchase French government military bonds with all the funds available to the Council, totaling five million francs (market price of 2.90 francs per yuan). It is also heard that these funds have now been remitted to the Paris Treasury for verification. This action by the French Municipal Council is in imitation of what some cities in France have done.

Foreign Nationals Donate to Aid the Netherlands

According to Mr. Baesvens, the Dutch Consul-General, Sassoon and other foreign nationals in this port, sympathetic to the Netherlands' resistance, donated 15,000 yuan in legal tender to the Dutch Red Cross yesterday. The Dutch Consulate has accepted the donation and will remit it to the motherland.

Trade with China Greatly Affected

According to the *China Press*, the most recent *Millard's Review* stated that the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium is detrimental to European trade with China. If Germany occupies the Netherlands and Belgium, the commercial activity of these two countries with the Far East will automatically cease, because the Allied nations still control the seas. On the other hand, if the German offensive fails and the Dutch and Belgian defense lines are not broken, the two countries will shift from economic activities to focusing on maintaining their defenses. Even if their exports do not completely stop, they will be greatly reduced. Belgian trade with China is very important. Among China's imports of steel plates, electrical materials, etc., Belgian goods have always been the most significant. In recent months, Dutch ships have ranked eighth in foreign shipping in Shanghai and sixth in all ports in China. The withdrawal of Dutch ships from the Far East will greatly weaken the position of Western shipping in the Far East.

Javanese Currency Linked to U.S. Dollar

According to sources in foreign banking circles in this port, the matter of separating the currencies of the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies (i.e., the Javanese guilder) and linking the latter to the U.S. dollar was implemented yesterday morning. Therefore, foreign banks in this port reopened exchange rates for the Javanese guilder yesterday, with 100 yuan in legal tender converting to 10.125 Javanese guilders. This means that the exchange rate between the Javanese guilder and the U.S. dollar is two to one. As for the currency of the Netherlands itself, quotations have not yet been opened.

French and Italian Mail Ships Attempt to Maintain Calm

The French mail ship company at No. 9 The Bund in this city, due to the precarious situation in the Mediterranean, has been strictly keeping the dates and itineraries of its mail ships entering and leaving secret since the day before yesterday to prevent danger from occurring, and will no longer announce them in advance. However, according to well-informed sources, the company had not yet received orders from Paris to detour as of yesterday. Therefore, the mail ships may still travel via the Mediterranean. As for the attitude of the Italian mail ship company, it is quite silent, as if quietly observing the changes in the situation. However, according to a person from the company speaking to reporters, there will be no changes to the company's itineraries and schedules in the very short term.

Commander of the French Forces Hosts a Tea Party with Great Success

According to the French-language *Shanghai Daily News*, Colonel Aissouty, the commander of the French garrison, and his wife held a tea party at their private residence on Qiqi Road the night before last (the 17th). Those in attendance included Mr. Bigot, representing French Ambassador Cosme; Mr. Gioia Mussi, representing the Italian Ambassador; Mrs. Masu, wife of the Italian Ambassador; Polish Chargé d'Affaires Rosset; British Consul-General George; Belgian Consul-General Goutson; Dutch Consul-General Baesvens; Spanish Consul-General Ical; U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Hepburn; British Yangtze River Fleet Commander Glasford; U.S. Cruiser *Augusta* Commander Magruder; Japanese Garrison Commander Hasegawa; British Garrison Commander Simons; U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment Commander Wedemeyer; Italian *San Marco* Marine Corps Commander Morandi; French Consul-General Oki; French Navy *Garnier* Warship Captain Rubin; French Garrison Commander of Shanghai District Attikos; Military Attaché and Air Force Counselor Jiffordan. In addition, there were also officials from the French and other countries' consulates and garrisons in Shanghai, and senior officials from the British and French concessions, totaling more than 350 guests, making it a grand event.

### U.S. Foreign Trade Week Begins; Celebrations by Chinese and Foreigners Alike; Today Is International Friendship Sunday; May 22 Is U.S. Maritime Day

U.S. Foreign Trade Week begins today. According to reports yesterday, the American Chamber of Commerce in this port will hold two major celebrations. A luncheon will be held next Friday (the 25th) at the American Club, jointly with the Associated American Universities, to host Chinese students who are going to study in the United States this year. More than a dozen students from the seven American schools in this port and their families will accompany them. A grand banquet will be held in the evening to host American expatriates in this port, with film screenings and speeches by famous people.

International Friendship

According to the English-language *China Press*, American expatriates in Shanghai, under the leadership of the American Chamber of Commerce, have scheduled a week from the 19th to the 25th of this month to commemorate "U.S. Foreign Trade Week." The 19th is called "International Friendship Sunday." American churches and religious organizations will have special commemorative programs. At 10:00 AM, Captain Margan, the chaplain of the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment, will preside over a special service at the Grand Theater. Lieutenant Colonel Dunshire, the chaplain of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, will be invited to speak on the topic of "International Friendship." At 11:00 AM, a commemorative service will be held at the American Community Church. At 7:00 PM, the Navy YMCA will also hold a service, with Smith speaking on "Sino-American Relations," and the public is welcome to attend.

Maritime Day

May 22 is U.S. Maritime Day. On this day, American expatriates in Shanghai will fly American flags at their homes, businesses, and cars to commemorate the occasion. May 20 is the date when the American merchant ship *Savannah*, the world's first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean, departed from the United States. Therefore, it has been designated as Maritime Day.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Concerned About People's Hardships; Orders Shops to Quickly Reduce Prices; As the Value of Legal Tender Rises, Commodity Prices Should Naturally Be Reduced; Strict Sanctions Will Be Imposed If Manipulation Continues

The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the dramatic changes in Shanghai exchange rates and the arbitrary increases in the prices of various commodities, has noted that although the exchange market has improved recently, commodity prices have not automatically decreased, which has greatly affected the livelihood of citizens. Therefore, on this (18th) day, the Council sent letters to various related commercial organizations, urging them to instruct their member stores to reduce sales prices by a certain date, and to strictly comply with the methods stipulated in the Council's Proclamation No. 5233. Any violations will be severely punished. The original letter is transcribed below:

Prices of Main Items Should Be Immediately Marked

In order to maintain security within the Settlement, the Council has recently established methods to improve social living conditions. However, some members of your association have not yet complied with the Council's Proclamation No. 5233, which requires them to display and mark the prices of the main items they sell. We are now writing to urge your association to promptly pay attention and immediately comply with the methods established by the Council. Do not delay any further.

As Currency Value Rises, Commodity Prices Should Decrease

In recent days, the value of Chinese legal tender has increased. However, retail stores have reduced commodity prices very little, or not at all. This situation must also be evident to your association. Commodity prices that were increased due to the decline in exchange rates should naturally be reduced when the price of Chinese legal tender rises (unless reasons satisfactory to the Council can be provided). Please inform your members that once the exchange rate improves, they must immediately reduce retail commodity prices so that the general public can benefit together.

Strict Enforcement Against Violations of Laws and Regulations

If you continue to disregard the Council's proclamations regarding necessities, and if there is any monopolistic speculation or hoarding of various main items, the Council will take appropriate steps to impose sanctions. Finally, the Council must state that it has no intention of interfering with or restricting legitimate business operations or their just and lawful profits. However, if excessive prices continue to be charged and attempts are made to undermine the Council's established methods for improving social living conditions, it will have no choice but to strictly enforce the regulations in order to protect the interests of the general public. In order to avoid misunderstandings, this circular and the Council's Proclamation No. 5233 have been translated into Chinese and are enclosed with this letter for your reference.

Market Price of Coal Briquettes Set to Plummet

After the market price of coal dust in this city plunged due to the sharp loosening of foreign exchange rates, prices are still expected to fall because of the continued surge in arrivals. Yesterday, the Hainan Loule vessel arrived in Shanghai, carrying more than 3,000 tons of Hongji white coal dust from French Indochina. At a time when hoarders are rushing to sell off their stocks, the further arrival of foreign coal will inevitably lead to a sharp drop in market prices. The market price of coal briquettes has already fallen four times, namely, 12 yuan the first time, 2 yuan the second time, 6 yuan the third time, and 4 yuan the fourth time. However, the total decrease is only 24 yuan per ton. The current wholesale price is 152 yuan per ton. Yesterday, the prices of various types of coal showed a trend of sharp decline, but in the end, they managed to maintain their original state. However, the sudden increase in available stock has attracted few buyers.

Gasoline and Soda Prices Reduced Simultaneously

The three major gasoline companies in this port, namely, Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum Company (Shell), and Texaco, reduced the price of gasoline by 20 cents per gallon yesterday in consideration of the interests of citizens, due to the recent improvement in foreign exchange rates. The price of gasoline was increased from 2.90 yuan to 3.50 yuan per gallon from the 4th of this month, but since yesterday it has been reduced to 3.30 yuan. Zheng Guanghe Soda Company, which had announced a 30% price increase on the 9th of this month, also announced its cancellation. It is hoped that other businesses will quickly follow suit for the sake of public welfare.

### All Sectors Sympathetic to Belgium's Resistance; Expressing Their Earnest Support; Fundraising to Donate Medicine for Wounded Soldiers and Refugees; Cai Shoukang and Others Plan to Visit the Belgian Ambassador

Sino-Belgian relations have always been friendly. Since the mutual exchange of ambassadors, national relations have become even closer. Belgian culture developed very early and can be compared with that of China, and the progress of modern art is particularly admired by countries around the world. Therefore, the number of young Chinese students who go to Belgium to study art is no less than that of the United States, France, and other countries. Belgium has also made the greatest effort to provide aid funds and donate medicines, etc.

Long-Standing Friendly Relations

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Belgium has begun this type of work. Two years ago, a certain director of overseas students once appealed to all sectors of Belgium for aid funds for Chinese medicine. Among them was a famous phrase: "If you plan to donate one franc to Spain, it is better to donate it to China, because donating one franc to Spain cannot save one person, but in China, it can treat five to ten people." As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately raised more than a million yuan, which shows that Belgium's substantive assistance to China is above general sympathy. After the appeal declaration issued by Ambassador Ghiolmu, all sectors in this port and the Belgian students, as well as the ambassador's friends and relatives, because of the spirit of Belgian friendship with China for decades as one day, and the current situation of China and Belgium is also the same.

Discussing Assistance

In a state of extreme difficulty, they endure fundraising to serve as medical expenses for wounded soldiers and refugees, in order to express the utmost concern of all sectors in China. It is heard that Cai Shoukang, the president of Cihui Hospital (慈惠醫院), which is organized by the Belgian Relief Association in China, and the famous sculptor Zhang Chongren (張充仁), etc., met the day before yesterday to discuss fundraising plans and agreed to visit the ambassador tomorrow to suggest a plan. If approved, they will begin to implement it. (Note: Cihui and Cih'an Hospitals were independently organized by the Belgian Relief Association in China, founded in February 1938. They are large in scale and have cost nearly one million yuan in the past three years. They accommodate Chinese civilians and are completely charitable in nature. They also have a convalescent hospital, where all seriously ill patients are treated.)

### Norwegian National Day Celebration; Broadcasts by Four Consuls; Consuls of France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Norway Express Confidence Together; Fighting Side-by-Side to Win the Final Victory

According to the English-language *China Press*, May 17th was the 126th anniversary of the promulgation of the Norwegian constitution. Mr. Kneuchtl, the Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires in China, and his wife specially hosted Norwegian expatriates on this day at the French Ball Club, with more than 200 people in attendance, including many Norwegian ship crew members. Mr. Kneuchtl gave a speech on the spot, reviewing the recent developments in the Norwegian situation, and said that the actions of King Haakon of Norway were precedents that all patriotic Norwegians should emulate. Mr. Kneuchtl concluded by resolutely expressing the confidence of the Norwegian people in the final victory, and raised a glass to the King and the Motherland. The Norwegians present responded enthusiastically in unison.

Fighting Side-by-Side; Difficult Task

According to the *North China Daily News*, the consuls-general of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway in Shanghai gave radio broadcasts to their respective expatriate communities in Shanghai and throughout China on the evening of May 17, the Norwegian National Day. First, French Consul-General Eugene gave a speech, briefly stating that he was very pleased to welcome the representatives of Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium to speak to their expatriate communities residing in Shanghai and throughout China. At this greatest of times, the most tragic battles in history are taking place on the land, sea, and air battlefields from Norway to the Swiss border. The armies of France, Britain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium are fighting side-by-side along this vast front, bearing the difficult task of repelling the most ferocious attack the civilized world has ever seen.

Struggling Hard in Icy and Snowy Conditions

Eugene turned to Norwegian Consul Gitel and said, "In the name of the French people and myself, I express my deepest sympathy to your country. King Haakon, who is loved by the people of your country, is travelling and working hard despite his age of sixty, not losing his calmness and determination, and is setting a precedent for courage and perseverance. The great war in the territories of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France has not made us neglect the struggle of the Norwegian army in the icy and snowy conditions to cut off the enemy's route to obtaining Swedish resources."

Dutch Queen Is Well-Loved

Eugene continued by addressing Dutch Consul-General Boissevain, saying, "The succinct and resolute speech delivered yesterday by Your Majesty Queen Wilhelmina of your country deeply moved the entire world, especially the United States. We will never be conquered, and our desire to resist will never change. Your Majesty's speech and King Leopold of Belgium's words to the defending troops of Liege, 'Resist to the end to save the motherland,' will be immortalized."

France and Belgium Will Fight Together to the End

Eugene then addressed Belgian Consul-General Ksen, saying, "Our two countries' armies have fought side-by-side twice, and the cities of Liege, Namur, and Sedan have been twice ravaged. History has been repeated. Today, one week after the start of this war, the German offensive has been blocked by the steel walls of our Allied forces. Hitler will meet the same fate as Wilhelm II. We will fight to the end so that we can restore joy to the world, that is, obtain lasting peace based on freedom and civilization. Long live France, long live the Allies!"

Norwegian Consul Delivers a Sorrowful Speech

After Eugene's speech, the French national anthem was played, followed by Gitel addressing the Norwegian expatriates on land and at sea in Norwegian. After briefly describing the significance of Norwegian National Day, he said, "Today, German troops have taken control of southern and central Norway, and their actions are just as we expected. Our King recently said that what the Germans are doing in Norway is not war but massacre. The enemy's actions are inhumane. To name just a few cities that have been completely destroyed, there are Clestinsen, Molde, Elfreland, and Lillehammer, all of which have no military objectives. The Germans committed this act in Belgium during the First World War, and they have been wreaking havoc in the Netherlands and Belgium for the past few days."

Dutch Expatriates Firmly Believe in Final Victory

Next, Boissevain gave a speech, briefly describing the events after the German army began its offensive against the Netherlands on the 10th of this month, saying that the Netherlands has always aimed at peaceful development, human prosperity, and joy. Now we must not be discouraged but must strive for the future, firmly believing that the principles of justice and freedom that we cherish will ultimately prevail. We have neither lost our glory nor diminished our confidence in the slightest.

Appealing for Aid for the Belgian Red Cross

Finally, Ksen addressed the Belgian expatriates in China, saying, "Belgium is now suffering its second invasion in twenty-five years. We are reminded again of the dark times of the World War and its misery. We must now ask ourselves, are we here too far away from this terrible struggle? How should we help our compatriots who are suffering now?" Ksen concluded by appealing to Belgian friends to generously donate to the Belgian Red Cross in order to take care of the Belgian people who have been driven from their homes and displaced by the Germans' barbaric acts.

### Dr. Petersen Awarded by the National Government

According to the English-language *China Press*, Dr. Petersen, a Danish surgeon in the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, has received an award from Chongqing. The certificate was signed by Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Executive Yuan, and stated that Dr. Petersen is commended for his enthusiasm for public welfare and meritorious service in relieving suffering and providing disaster relief.

Made No Announcement

It was heard that the Commission has taken into consideration the recent increase in the level of living and has decided to submit its recommendations to the Finance Committee.

### Speculators' Unprecedented Misfortune; U.S. Goods Plummet in Price; Stocks Plunge Sharply; Speculative Losses Exceed 20 Million

The major speculators in this port who hoard goods have now encountered a bitter and serious blow. The magnitude of their losses is truly only seen in every financial upheaval in Shanghai. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency who inquired with authorities in import and export trade in this port, since the Shanghai War, general and larger speculators have hoarded European and American goods. Soon after, with the outbreak of the European war, they again regarded hoarding American goods as the only reliable way

To Get Rich Quickly

But unexpectedly, in the United States, the prices of various goods, whether they are piece goods, rubber, cotton yarn, or other raw materials or finished products, have all plummeted to unprecedented levels. In addition, American stocks have also plunged sharply. Therefore, the market prices of all American goods have fallen across the board. According to estimates from foreign businesses in this port, as of the day before yesterday (the 17th), the losses incurred by powerful speculators in Shanghai will amount to between 20 million and 30 million yuan, at the very least exceeding 20 million yuan. Furthermore, due to the depreciation of U.S. goods, all other goods in this port, whether they are European goods or other foreign goods, or even Chinese native goods, have been affected by this and all without exception

Followed Suit in Declining

Therefore, all those in Shanghai who speculate by hoarding goods, whether large or small, have suffered heavy losses. This is truly another unexpected and serious blow to speculators in this port during this sharp rebound of the black market exchange rate. Those engaged in hoarding should be aware that the amount of goods hoarded in the two concessions of Shanghai is truly unprecedented. Not only are the customs warehouses piled up and empty, but even after the Jianghai Customs repeatedly urged them to clear the goods, they were ultimately unable to leave the warehouses due to sluggish sales. In addition, all other bank warehouses are also full to the brim. Therefore, although most speculators are still reluctant to sell off their stocks at a loss, it is ultimately difficult to maintain the situation and they will inevitably suffer even greater losses. This is the inevitable result.

### Strictly Prevent Speculation and Eliminate Arbitrage; Adopt an Appropriate Level; Maintain the Commercial Interests of Friendly Nations; Maintain Sufficient Funds and Consolidate the Strength of the Legal Tender

After the Shanghai black market exchange rate sharply contracted from the 1st, the shrinking trend was very strong in a few days. Speculators took the opportunity to stir up trouble, and the ignorant masses were worried. However, the tendency of the exchange rate to increase in the past week proves that this contraction was a planned operation and not an indication of insufficient legal tender strength. As for the Chinese government, in order to safeguard the commercial interests of all friendly nations, it continues to maintain the rate at the expense of huge losses. However, from an operational standpoint, the previous level was too high, so the exchange rate had to be gradually reduced to find an appropriate level.

Friendly Nations' Understanding

The government has long been determined to stabilize foreign exchange, maintain currency credibility, and stabilize finance. However, in order to prevent the activities of speculators in Shanghai, financial institutions have adopted a cautious approach to lending, raising all interest rates to make speculation unprofitable. Moreover, certain parties are constantly exchanging legal tender to arbitrage foreign exchange. Maintaining high exchange rates would fall into their trap. Therefore, the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has adopted an appropriate level, which has been understood by people from various friendly nations. The so-called depletion of the exchange fund is completely unfounded. In fact, the fund balance is still abundant, amounting to three to four million pounds.

Foreign Exchange Abundance

Since the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, the financial institutions of the Netherlands and Belgium in China have been affected, and their credit has shown signs of wavering. In order to cope with the withdrawal of deposits by depositors, the banks had to dispose of all their foreign exchange. Therefore, the changes in the Shanghai foreign exchange market on the 11th were completely unexpected. At the same time, the Dutch East Indies was uneasy due to the invasion of the Netherlands. Overseas Chinese residing there remitted more money back to China to ensure safety in preparation for possible dangers and strict exchange control. Among them, the most flowed into Shanghai. The amount of this remittance was quite large, so the exchange rate's rise was natural.

Gradually Stabilizing

China's foreign trade has improved after adjustment. According to the customs report, in the first quarter of this year, foreign trade had a surplus of 21.39 million yuan. Moreover, the European war is brewing major changes, and there may be unexpected developments in foreign trade in the future. Therefore, the exchange market can be stabilized without external force. The Shanghai exchange market will inevitably find a phenomenon of oversupply, which will cause the legal tender exchange rate to rise. It is also heard that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee will, in order to maintain the current level for a long time, buy foreign exchange from the market when necessary to replenish the fund, so that the fund is sufficient and the currency is credible.

### Zhou Junchang and Gu Pengcheng Were Suddenly Kidnapped Yesterday Morning; They Encountered Bandits in the Suburbs of Shanghai; The Police are Investigating and Rescuing Them

At about 8:30 yesterday morning, at the north end of the railway on Route Ghisi, west of Shanghai, a well-known German doctor, Zhou Junchang, a construction engineer, Gu Pengcheng, and a groom were riding horses in the suburbs. When they passed by that place, six bandits suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, threatening and intimidating them with guns, and immediately kidnapped them. They took Zhou and the others into a car parked on Route Ghisi and sped away towards the Chinese area.

Kidnapped by Bandits

At this time of early summer, Chinese and Western ladies in Shanghai like to ride horses in the suburbs every morning. Zhou Junchang, a German doctor, and Gu Pengcheng, a construction engineer, met because of seeing a doctor, and their friendship became very deep. They often rode horses together on various roads in western Shanghai. At 5:45 yesterday morning, Zhou hired a car to Gu's residence (address below) and took Gu's own light green car, number 7302, driven by Gu himself, to a stable on Yuyuan Road, where they boarded their horses and galloped west. A groom followed. When they arrived at Route Ghisi, the north end of the railway on Route Ghisi, six bandits suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, all holding pistols, prohibiting any noise. They forcibly dragged the three of them into a car of a certain number on the side of the road and fled towards the Chinese area. Afterwards, another Westerner riding a horse witnessed everything. He knew both Zhou and Gu, so Gu Pengcheng used English to notify the Westerner and asked him to drive his car, number 7302, home and notify his family. Later, Gu's wife relayed the above to Zhou's house and reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The police are now investigating and rescuing them, and they must solve the case and bring the perpetrators to justice.

### Night Soil Workers Resumed Work Yesterday; The Strike Wave Has Completely Subsided; Accumulated Dirt and Filth are Actively Removed

The road workers, sewer workers, transportation workers, garbage workers, and street cleaners of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council requested an increase in wages, resulting in a strike wave. After mediation and resolution, the workers first resumed work the day before yesterday, and the night soil workers also accepted the persuasion of the Political Department and announced their resumption of work yesterday morning. As a result, the strike wave, which had been deadlocked for a week, completely subsided. The garbage and feces accumulated during the strike period have been actively removed by the Public Works Department, which has urged garbage workers, sewer workers, and street cleaners to actively remove them separately. The Public Works Department stipulates that all garbage accumulated in the alleys shall be the responsibility of the garbage workers to sweep away, and the garbage on the roads and in the vegetable markets shall be cleared by the Public Works Department sending vehicles separately, in order to speed up the process. It is expected that the city will be clean again within a few days. The Municipal Council, in order to understand the suffering of the workers, will issue wages for the strike period next week.

### Chartering Case Loss - Tongsheng Company Lost the Case; The Defendant Was Ordered to Compensate the Full Amount

Zeng Bingsen, a Fujianese who once served as a naval captain, opened the Tongsheng Shipping Company in partnership in March of last year. He chartered the Norwegian merchant ship Landi through Taichangxiang Shipping Company, No. 6 Jiqingli, Sanyangjingqiao, at a monthly rent of 887 pounds and 10 shillings. At that time, the charter was signed for a period of one year. However, it was not long before the Tongsheng Company said it had:

Lost all its capital

and requested to return the ship. However, Taichangxiang believed that the company had violated the charter agreement, so the legal representative of the company, Han Jinhua, hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a lawsuit against the shareholders of Tongsheng Company - Zeng Bingsen, Zeng Yiping, Huang Siku, Dai Wenlin, Chen Shaoji, Yao Yongwen, Zeng Nianci, Liu Nianhua, Zeng Jizhi, Chen Xiaozeng, Liu Ganrong, and Yao Shoumin - in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court for violating the chartering agreement. Judge Chen Can:

Held several hearings

to hear the case. Among the defendants, Chen Shaoji hired lawyer Zhang Danping, and Zeng Jizhi and Huang Ruku hired lawyer Ma Shouhua as agents to appear in court and submit counter-evidence, claiming that they had withdrawn from the partnership. The remaining defendants failed to appear in court throughout the proceedings. In the end, due to the complexity of the situation, after more than half a year: Yesterday, the judgment was announced. In Chinese, it stated that Zeng Bingsen, Zeng Yiping, Liu Zhenhui, Liu Mengxian, and Wang Wei should:

Jointly and severally compensate

the plaintiff 943 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence, as well as 73,365 yuan and 0.01 yuan in national currency, plus statutory interest calculated at a weekly rate of 5% from the date of filing the lawsuit to the date of execution. The litigation costs, excluding the defendants Zeng Jizhi, Chen Shaoji, Huang Ruku, Yao Rongwen, and Dai Wenlin, shall be borne by the defendant; the remaining expenses shall be borne jointly and severally by the defendants Zeng Bingsen, et al.

### Three Sisters Were Injured in a Car Accident; They Sued for Damages; Driving Without a License Caused a Public Prosecution

Bai Lancun (26 years old), Bai Meicun (24 years old), and Bai Xiecun (18 years old), three sisters from Hubei who live at No. 12 Zhilanfang, Route Ghisi, west of the Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession, all work as dancers at the Paramount Ballroom on Route Bingyuan in western Shanghai. On March 11, at 8:00 p.m., the three sisters hired rickshaws pulled by Shen Linhua, Ji Aixian, and Liu Guojun, all from Jiangbei:

to go to the Paramount

Ballroom for dancing. When they passed the intersection of Route Fuxi and Route Shengmuyuan, Xin Hongbin (23 years old, from Shandong), a copper worker from the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, drove a bus that had just been repaired from the bus factory at No. 1171 Kangnaodao:

out for a test drive.

When he drove to the intersection of Route Fuxi and Route Shengmuyuan, he was speeding west and in the same direction as the three rickshaws, from east to west, behind the rickshaws,

unable to brake

to avoid them, causing the three rickshaws carrying the Bai sisters to be hit. All three Bai sisters fell out of the rickshaws and were injured. Patrolman No. 542 investigated and found that he sent the injured women to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, and at the same time took Xin Hongbin to the French Concession Police Station to await investigation and handling. Now that the three Bai sisters have been treated in the hospital and have been healed for two months, the police sent the defendant Xin Hongbin to the Eighth Division of the Second Special Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated the case, saying that the defendant:

drove without a license

and caused the accident. He is now prosecuting him for negligent injury and violating traffic regulations in accordance with Article 284 of the Criminal Code, and requesting that he be investigated and punished according to law. The victims, i.e., the plaintiffs, the Bai sisters, were accompanied by their father, Bai Huasan (60 years old), and hired lawyers Playfair and Ai Zhenlin as agents to request incidental civil proceedings, seeking to recover damages, medical expenses, and lost business due to injury, and requesting that the defendant be ordered to compensate Bai Lancun for 1,500 yuan, Bai Meicun for 5,000 yuan (due to:

scars on the face

that cannot be treated and restored), and Bai Xuecun for 2,000 yuan. The defendant Xin Hongbin hired lawyers Fan and Yu Enliang to defend him, admitting that he did not have a driver's license and was driving the car out for a test drive when he accidentally caused the accident. After Judge Ai Xiaogen verified the confession, he ordered the defendant to post bail and adjourned the hearing to a later date after the victim's injury.

### A Young Crazy Woman Acts Up in the Downtown Area and Obstructs the Trolleybus with a Prank

At around 6:00 last night, in front of the Dashin Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, there was a young and beautiful crazy woman acting up. She was holding a two-month-old girl in her arms and wandering in the middle of the road. At first, she murmured softly, and then she put the child on the main road. When a trolleybus of a certain number arrived, she deliberately pulled down the trolley pole (commonly known as "tou er ling") from behind, making the bus unable to move. She did this two or three times, laughing wildly. Later, passers-by gathered and saw that she had a beautiful face and clean clothes, and was not a beggar. However, when asked repeatedly, she spoke incoherently and did not know what she was talking about. Later, as more and more people gathered to watch, the patrolmen arrived and drove her away. She then walked north alone. (Huaguang News Agency)

### Residents of the Gu Ba Xin Cun Oppose the Order to Vacate

The Gu Ba Xin Cun on Gu Ba Road is owned by Guangxin Company. There are more than 40 houses, including shops and apartments, totaling no less than 90 units. Before the war, less than one-third of them were rented out. After August 13, the Real Estate Department of the Four Banks Trust, which managed the village, repeatedly increased rents. Last November, the tenants negotiated with Zhu Zhichao, the representative of the Real Estate Department of the bank, and agreed on three conditions: (1) Each tenant would be given an additional rent of 15 yuan per house; (2) A painting fee of 60 yuan will be given with each contract; (3) After the expiration of the contract, each tenant can continue to enjoy this right. In order to protect the interests of the tenants, contracts can be prepaid in accordance with the above conditions. Unexpectedly, the above regulations were agreed upon at the end of last year. In May of this year, the owner suddenly entrusted the management of the village to the business firm Rouyi Shi. According to the announcement of the firm, it has been entrusted by the owner to sell the houses in the village in separate units, and ordered the tenants to vacate the houses within a time limit. More than 90 tenants unanimously and firmly opposed this announcement, argued reasonably, and absolutely refused to move out, and would not stop until the owner withdrew the original proposal.

### Unemployed Messengers Punished for Impersonating and Deceiving

Xu Wenming, Yao Xueqing, Xu Yeming, and other messengers from the former Nanshi China Telegraph Bureau, became unemployed after the war. Recently, due to extreme poverty, they each wore messenger uniforms and carried donation books to solicit donations from all walks of life. At noon the day before yesterday, Xu and others again solicited 2 yuan from a Western employee of the Public Works Bureau Health Department at No. 1221 Lane 1, Route Avenue Edward VII, but the employee, Truellet, found out after returning home that these people were soliciting donations under false names, which was close to fraud. He reported it to the police, who sent detectives to arrest Xu and the other three, and confiscated two donation books and 17.5 yuan in banknotes, and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police handed them over to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Fang Fushu, filed a lawsuit according to law. Judge Zhong interrogated them and sentenced Xu and the other three to a fine of 30 yuan each, and the donation books were confiscated. Tong Jiajun, the eldest son of Tong Zhongyi, a well-known martial arts master and trauma expert, held a wedding ceremony with Ms. Yuan Xiuying, the daughter of Yuan Ruiting, a prominent family from Cangxian, Hebei, yesterday at the Huibinlou Restaurant. The wedding officiant was the famous lawyer Tang Hao, and more than 500 people from the Shanghai gentry and business circles attended to congratulate them. The guests gathered together, which was a grand occasion for a time.

### A Public Bus Kills a Six-Year-Old Girl

Hu Fanglin, the six-year-old daughter of Hu Zuchang (38 years old, from Wuxi), who lives at No. 28 Tongdeli, No. 223 Route Fuxi, was crossing the road from south to north at the gate of No. 213 Route Fuxi at nearly 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. A French-owned bus F824 of Route 22, driven by bus driver Li Jingui, was speeding from east to west. The girl could not avoid it and was hit and injured in the head, and died instantly. The patrolman inspected and copied the number, and sent the child's body to the Tongren Fuyuantang Examination Office. He reported it to the patrolman. Yesterday, the police reported to Zhao Changmin, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, to inspect the body and confirm that she died from being hit. After questioning the defendant about what happened, he ordered the father of the corpse to sign a bond to claim the corpse, and the defendant was handed over to the court by the police department for prosecution.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Buying Momentum Weakened

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listing showed no ups and downs. The dark market for British and American exchange was quieter than before. However, due to unfavorable news for buyers, such as Italy's participation in the war, speculators disappeared. External investors were less active, and the momentum waned. There was no rebound. As for the trading process, the morning started with a sharp contraction in the exchange rate, and the US exchange rate was tight at the opening. However, Chinese speculators soon began to sell, followed by Japanese banks appearing with spot goods, dropping into forward contracts. American banks also showed a willingness to sell and sold up to 20,000 pounds of spot shillings, with loose prices emerging one after another. Therefore, by noon, spot British gold at 4 1/125 pence was relatively easy to close. As a result, British gold was quoted at 4.109375 pence and the US exchange rate was 5.53125 yuan, with the former rising by 0.078125 and the latter slightly hardening by 0.0625 compared to the previous close. The forward contract weakened more than the spot market, so the price difference between the current month's forward contract and the spot price was close.

Japanese Banks Still Appeared with Spot Goods

In the morning, London's large transactions nearly fell by 3.125, New York's silver price remained flat, and London's raw gold was stable. The exchange rate between British and American dollars remained unchanged, with an increase of 0.0625 against Shanghai, and the same against France. The US dollar rose by 10 cents against Shanghai and slightly less than 3.25 cents against France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 4.03125 pence for British gold and 5.375 yuan for the US exchange rate, which was flat for British gold and tight for US exchange rate by 0.09375 compared to the previous day's closing, due to the sharp decline in the exchange rate. After the opening, the market was quite hardened due to the jamming of Chinese speculators. It is estimated that Chinese speculators sold US exchange rates to foreign banks for May at 5.375 yuan. HSBC's listing was announced without any changes. The balance tax on silver was announced without any increase or decrease. The trend remained loose afterwards, because Japanese and American banks were willing to sell, while foreign banks' appetite remained weak. The Japanese bank appeared with US exchange rates for foreign banks at 5.5625 yuan. However, after accepting the orders, a certain American bank transferred 20,000 pounds of spot British gold to HSBC and Macalli at a price of 4.125 pence, as it did not have a large amount of legal tender. By the time the noon market closed, there were few changes. As a result, British gold was 4.109375 pence and US exchange rate was 5.53125 yuan. May's British gold was 4.0625 pence and the US exchange rate was 5.4375 yuan. June's British gold was 3.90625 pence and the US exchange rate was 5.1875 yuan, with spot goods rising by 0.078125 for British gold and hardening by 0.0625 for the US exchange rate compared to the closing price yesterday. The May and June futures each weakened by 0.15625 and the US also weakened by 0.125. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

Hong Kong's US Exchange Rate Fluctuated

Hong Kong, 18th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened with turbulence this morning. British exchange spot and futures both stood at the original level. US exchange spot was tight at 5.625, at 19.875 yuan (yesterday's closing was 20.4375 yuan). Shanghai exchange spot fell by 3 yuan, to 362 yuan (yesterday's closing was 365 yuan). Japanese exchange spot was tight by 1.5 yuan, at 85 yuan. At 10:00 a.m., the market was flat. US exchange spot weakened by 0.0625, to 19.9375 yuan. At 10:15 a.m., the market stabilized. US exchange spot continued to weaken by 0.0625, to 20 yuan. Shanghai exchange spot continued to fall by 2 yuan, to 260 yuan. At 10:50 a.m., the market stabilized. US exchange spot continued to weaken by 0.0625, to 20.0625 yuan. At 11:30 a.m., the market was flat and there were no changes in the exchange rates. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

Tianjin British Flat, US Tight

Tianjin, 18th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened weakly this morning. British exchange spot was unchanged, still standing at 3.6875 pence. US exchange spot was tighter by 0.125 compared to yesterday's opening, at 4.875 yuan. Shanghai exchange rose by half a yuan, to 110 yuan and 50 cents. The "United Note" dark market rose by 1.5 yuan, to 100 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Continue to Decline

Yesterday's foreign currency market was boosted by the sharp fall of the US stock index in New York by six yuan, the breakthrough of the Maginot Line by the German army, and the fact that the atmosphere of Italy's participation in the war has not disappeared. All of these were sufficient to boost selling sentiment. US dollar bills initially fell by 5.5 points against the pound price. In the morning, it briefly rose to 18 yuan and 40 cents, but then immediately fell, and after the morning close, it retreated to 17 yuan and 60 cents, eventually reaching 17 yuan and 75 cents, which was still a drop of 40 cents compared to the previous day. The supply of British gold bills was also smooth, and the market price was very soft. British and American gold pounds followed the price of gold and fell. Hong Kong bills followed the trend of lower exchange rates between Hong Kong and Shanghai. French franc bills and Singapore Philippine bills also became weak. There was a sudden supply of Japanese gold bills, with an evening wave of 2.14 yuan. The supply and demand of Korean bills were still uniform, with the evening price still at 92 cents.

### Discount Rate Squeezed by Three Yuan

Yesterday's exchange bill discount rate was stable with a slight decline, ranging from 115 yuan to 120 yuan per 1,000 yuan, with a final rate of 112 yuan, squeezed by 3 yuan. The Money Dealers Association's lending rate was quoted at 21 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets, a drop of one cent.

### Although Fluctuations Narrow, Gold Market Still Unable to Escape Downtrend

Yesterday, the spot gold bullion (shā chì) grey market saw calmer conditions, with the range of fluctuations gradually narrowing. However, conflicting rumors regarding positive and negative news persisted, and the weakening of foreign exchange rates further suppressed any upward movement. Consequently, prices fell by over one hundred yuan. The market opened at 5,900 yuan amidst selling pressure, exacerbated by active selling from banks, driving the price down to 5,850 yuan. However, after a short period, securities firms, money exchange businesses, and gold shops collectively engaged in purchasing, briefly pushing the price up to 5,950 yuan. Ultimately, due to retail investors taking the opportunity to sell off their holdings and banks selling short at the higher price, the market was quickly pushed down to a low of 5,810 yuan for the day. Before the market closed, short positions were covered, leading to a rebound to 5,900 yuan. However, the prevailing pessimistic sentiment led to a final close at 5,865 yuan, a decrease of 105 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Trading volume fluctuated between periods of quiet and activity, totaling approximately two thousand taels. Gold jewelry prices at jewelry stores decreased by ten yuan. Prices for customs gold remained stable.

Bullion Further Declines by One Hundred Yuan

From early morning, even though exchange rates initially showed a sharp decline, the U.S. dollar quickly rebounded, and the British pound weakened against the U.S. dollar, leading to pessimistic sentiment. Initially, gold shops offered ten taels of gold at 5,900 yuan, a decrease of seventy yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, due to one bank's inclination to sell off holdings and a lack of buyers, prices were further suppressed by fifty yuan. One bank, along with jewelry shops and other businesses, offered a total of thirty taels at 5,850 yuan. Then, a money exchange business suddenly made a large purchase, and a securities firm also showed strong buying appetite, while sellers gradually decreased. Prices soon rebounded by one hundred yuan, with the money exchange business trading fifty taels at 5,950 yuan. However, with the exchange rate still weakening, it was inevitable that those who had accumulated at high prices would sell off. Shortly after, the market briefly reached the 5,900 yuan mark. At that time, one bank resumed selling, and another bank followed suit, pushing the price down again by ninety yuan. Money exchange businesses traded ten taels at 5,810 yuan. Later, as selling pressure subsided, prices rebounded again, with banks and retail investors covering short positions. With fewer sellers, prices were pushed up by several tens of yuan, with banks and gold shops trading sixty taels at 5,900 yuan. As the market approached closing, buyers decreased, and prices declined again. Banks sold sixty taels to securities firms and money exchange businesses at 5,865 yuan as the afternoon closing price, resulting in a decrease of 105 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by one hundred and forty yuan throughout the half-day. The selling price of gold by cash shops, based on the bullion price, was ten yuan higher. The purchasing price was thirty yuan lower. The actual price of standard gold was over fifty yuan lower than the listed price, and transactions were infrequent.

Jewelry Prices Decrease by Ten Yuan

The initial asking price for gold jewelry at jewelry stores was 610 yuan per tael at major stores. However, at 10:35 AM, prices decreased by ten yuan, and remained unchanged afterwards. As a result, major stores revised their prices to 600 yuan, while new stores maintained the same price. Purchasing prices were reduced by approximately thirty yuan.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Decline

London, 17th: The large bar silver market is nearly flat, with a slight decrease of 3125. After widespread purchasing, there is satisfaction. Speculators are selling forward contracts, and the market is flat. After the market closes, there are buyers at the listed price, while sellers are taking a wait-and-see approach. New York: Both spot and forward prices for American silver are flat. Bombay: Spot and forward prices for Indian silver have both decreased by a small amount, 7 annas. The market is flat, with a total of 100 contracts traded.

### Yarn and Cotton Fluctuate Significantly, Not Yet Fully Stabilized

The yarn market, which has seen wild up-and-down swings in recent days, has now become more stable. The overall trend, however, remains weak. This is because previous prices were pushed too high, and the subsequent correction has been a sharp decline. Many speculative positions remain unresolved, so the speculative mood has not subsided. The market continues to move towards weakness. Therefore, it is difficult to expect an upturn in the near term.

The spot yarn market opened this morning with neutral sentiment, and the market was calm. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,335 yuan, rising slightly to 1,345 yuan. Then, news of liquidation of long positions and weakening exchange rates led to a decline to 1,310 yuan. Shortly after, reports of slight demand from Guangdong merchants pushed the price up again to 1,327 yuan. However, after the market closed, the continued weakening of exchange rates led to another decline. The total transaction volume for the half-day was 1,602 bales. 1,690 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 19th. The quantity purchased by each group is listed below:

Hong Kong 500, Other Merchants 990

Yunnan 12, Total 1,601

### Spot Cotton Trading Stagnates

Spot cotton trading has completely come to a standstill. This is because the European war is becoming increasingly chaotic, leading to uncertain sentiment. As a result, there is no trading activity.

Another report: The price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market was initially strong, but later the market became panicked. The sharp decline in stock prices on Wall Street had a significant impact on commodity prices, and the closing price of cotton fell by more than 20 points yesterday. The Indian cotton market is remarkably stable, rising 8 or 9 rupees compared to the previous day, but the projected sharp decline is 14 rupees, so the net drop is 6 rupees compared to the previous day.

The increasing volatility of the Shanghai foreign cotton market has led to a sharp decline in trading by foreign firms. The inventory in the market is scarce, so the selling price of raw cotton in Shanghai is not affected by overseas cotton markets. The general consensus is that transportation difficulties will cause cotton prices to rise in the future. This may be true. The delivered factory price of U.S. cotton futures yesterday, based on an exchange rate of 5.375 U.S. dollars, is as follows:

20-count U.S. Middling 341.80

20-count, Lower Grade 232.10

22-count, 365.50

30-count, Lower Grade 357.20

42-count, 369.90

42-count, Lower Grade 358.50

### Grain: Rice Market Slightly Declines, Flour Market Flat

The rice market ended with a decline of between half a yuan and a yuan. Sellers initially wanted to raise prices, but buyers were hesitant, leading to a weakening trend. Prices for all grades of rice fell by half a yuan. For example, No. 1 old Saigon rice opened at 50.05 yuan, No. 2 at 48.5 yuan, and Small Jia at 47 yuan. As prices fell, speculators suddenly absorbed supply. The price of Small Jia was like a ball, and the Small Jia price quickly returned to 47.8 yuan. However, other Saigon grades, because of lack of trading interest and sluggish actual sales, did not move and remained flat. No. 2 Siam was unpopular, feeling even more sluggish. Small Jia was also difficult to hold for long, and prices quickly declined for all grades. At the close, the prices for all grades were: Small Jia at 47 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 48 yuan, 47.5 yuan, Fire Pattern 49 yuan, 48.5 yuan, a decline of half a yuan from before. No. 1 old Saigon, because it was affected by the sluggishness of domestic rice, decreased by about one yuan, to 50 yuan, 49.5 yuan. No. 2 Siam was only 46.7 yuan, 46.5 yuan.

Speculative trading in foreign rice has not disappeared completely. Market prices fluctuate, with swings of more than half a yuan. The market was flat in the morning, rebounded at noon, and then fell again in the afternoon. Small Jia opened at 47 yuan in the morning, rising to 47.78 yuan, but then fell from 47.5 yuan to 47 yuan in the afternoon. The final closing price was 47.2 yuan. Saigon and Siam had less fluctuation, and both ended weaker by 45 points and 67 points from the previous day. There was no trading of British and Chinese companies, and Ningbo and other buyer groups did not inquire today due to the weekend.

Domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica varieties, has continued to arrive in large quantities, 2,000 to 3,000 bags each day. With the arrival of the mildew season, the quality of the rice is easily degraded, so rumors are circulating in the off-market grey market. Sentiment is weak, holders are eager to sell, and buyers are reluctant to buy, resulting in limited trading activity. Selling prices have fallen by more than one yuan. Wuxi Special Clean japonica is 51 yuan to 50 yuan, Powder japonica is 48.9 yuan, Chang Kun japonica is around 50 yuan, but those with heat damage are only 46.7 yuan, Qing Si Thin Rice is 48.9 yuan, or 47 yuan, and Nan Gang early rice is 46.7 yuan. The supply of glutinous rice is limited, but sales are strong due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival, both retail and wholesale. Therefore, the market is not affected by japonica and indica rice, and is uniquely tight, with prices increasing by half a yuan. Jin Li Special Yuan sells for 44 yuan retail, and Chang Dan goods also require 42.3 yuan.

Trading of spot flour is even quieter. Actual sales in the local market have gradually decreased since the dumping of domestic flour. Customer sales were active once before, but now have become quiet again, so the market is unusually quiet. Although the prices of No. 2 flour mills have not changed, the return cargo of the Old Car brand at 13.9 yuan still lacks buyers. Domestic flour such as Shun Feng and Shan Lu brands is only 13.5 yuan and also has no formal sales. Apart from the thousands of bags sold by factories, the rest is being withheld. Also, 9,300 bags of flour (19th) were shipped to Hong Kong.

Wheat trading has been quiet for a long time. New wheat in various regions is already being harvested, and new wheat should be on the market in early June.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Slightly Rebound, Far East Stocks All Decline

The securities grey market yesterday shifted from sluggish to slightly firmer. Rumors about peace and treasury bonds were proven false. Yesterday, Jiufeng consistently covered short positions, and Defu was actively taking long positions. Lianhe also bought a lot. Tongkang, Hongda, Hongkang, and No. 64 all had buying interest in varying degrees. Yongkang and Yitai sold in the morning and afternoon. Xieda and Lianyi were also inclined to sell. With buyers being more aggressive, the situation was relatively better. Market prices ended with gains of 1.5 to 3 points for most, except for those that failed to open in the afternoon, which were slightly down by 5 points. The total value of transactions was over 700,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 59.90 59.50 59.90 Up 0.30

Unified B 51.60 51.25 51.60 Down 0.20

Unified C 49.60 49.25 49.60 Up 0.15

Unified D 48.2 - 48.25 Up 0.05

Unified E 50.05 49.80 50.05 Up 0.15

In stock trading, 40 shares of Zhendai Yarn Mill were traded at a price of 88 yuan.

HSBC Bank's London-registered shares fell £6 to £80, and Hong Kong-registered shares fell £4.5 to £82. Chartered Bank shares fell 5 shillings to £12 5 shillings. However, Colacre Rubber shares continued to rebound, rising 1.5 pence to 18 shillings 1.5 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

London, 17th (Friday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable. There were no changes in any bonds up or down.

### Shanghai Textile Declares Dividend of 7.5 Yuan

The net profit of Nisshin Shanghai Textile Co., Ltd. for the 34th term (i.e., the half-year ending April 1940) was 6.84 million Japanese yen. Together with the retained earnings from the previous term, the total was over 8.75 million Japanese yen. It is proposed to pay a dividend of 5 Japanese yen per share and a bonus of 2.5 Japanese yen per share, for a total of 7.5 Japanese yen.

Anglo-Japanese Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. will hold its annual shareholders' meeting on May 31st. It is proposed to pay a dividend of 3 National Currency yuan per share for 1939.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Extremely Limited Soybean Arrivals

Yesterday's soybean market was weak due to a sharp drop of 2 to 3 yuan in soybean oil, resulting in a lack of buying interest. Only scattered sales in the local market were recorded, totaling 300 bags of Wuhu beans at a price of 23 yuan to 12 yuan, 700 bags of Anqing beans at a price of 13.7 yuan to 23.3 yuan, 100 bags of Sangyuan beans at a price of 21.7 yuan, and 30 bags of Pudong green soybeans at a price of 24 yuan.

### Coal: Coal Briquettes at 8.2 Yuan

Coal briquette prices, since the shilling rebounded, have fallen from a high of 9.4 yuan per dan at retail shops to 8.4 yuan. Factory prices have also quickly decreased twice, reducing the price by 18 yuan. Yesterday, due to the continued weakening of the shilling, the company decided to further reduce factory prices by 4 yuan. The prices for deliveries by fellow traders from their own vehicles are 252 yuan, with an additional charge for delivery. The prices at local retail shops are 20.05 yuan per basket, or 8.2 yuan per dan.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Sales Uniquely Strong

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's market decline gradually eased, as both actual sales and new hoarders stepped in to purchase. However, due to nervous sentiment, most selling offers were tight on the surface but loose in reality, and actual transaction prices were lower than market offers, creating much confusion. However, actual sales of coarse cloth were uniquely strong, and prices were also the most firm. The price of each type of goods from the British Lun Chang factory has remained firm this week, but hand goods have fallen across the board. Yesterday, the factory price of Entertainment Floral Cloth alone fell by 3 yuan. Local sales included over 300 bags of Yihe coarse cloth, over 100 bags of fine cloth and fine twill. Ningbo and Taizhou buyers purchased two to three hundred pieces of coarse cloth, twill, colored cloth, and colored twill. Guangdong buyers purchased over one hundred pieces of colored cloth and colored twill.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday's market rose and fell abruptly, slightly shifting from weak to firm. The opening price of Dragon Head fine cloth fell from 44 yuan to 43 yuan, then rebounded to 44.5 yuan in the afternoon. Market sentiment was quite good, with asking prices reaching 45 yuan. However, with actual sales remaining sluggish and fellow traders selling off, the price fell to 43.75 yuan at closing, an increase of 7.5 points from the previous day. Mid-range miscellaneous brand fine cloth remained between 45 and 46 yuan. It is said that fellow traders still have many hand goods in stock this month, so optimism is unwarranted. The closing price of Four Gentlemen Thousand Serge was 1.255 yuan per yard, increasing to 1.28 yuan this month, also rebounding by 3 points.

Exports: 10 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Turkey today (19th), and another 80 pieces will be shipped to Siam.

### Baleni Cloth Sells Well

Yesterday, Saturday, the woolen cloth market remained extremely tight. Baleni cloth was in high demand among native buyers, with both striped and solid colors selling well. Due to the lack of new arrivals, the market is increasingly bullish. Yesterday, the wholesale selling price of British-made No. 1 Baleni cloth in various colors was 32 to 33 yuan per yard, No. 2 was 27 to 28 yuan, and No. 3 was 21 to 22 yuan. Eastern goods No. 1 sold for 23 to 24 yuan, No. 2 for 18 to 19 yuan, and No. 3 for 15 to 16 yuan. Shanghai Textile's own goods had no production. Fellow traders generally lacked whole-sale spot goods, so hand goods are in high demand and unrivaled.

### Silk and Tea: Zhejiang Cocoons Open, Limited Arrivals

Yesterday's silk market saw further declines in both Japan and the U.S. Yokohama spot prices were down slightly 40 yuan, and forward prices were down slightly 34 yuan. New York recent deliveries down 8.5 points, forward down one dime. Current exchange rates are also unfavorable for the export industry, so foreign sales are even more sluggish. British and American merchants have recently been uneasy about the industry and rarely inquire.

Regarding cocoon news, cocoons have opened in the Xiaxie area of Zhejiang province yesterday. However, due to poor harvests, cocoon arrivals are very limited. Old cocoons from eastern Zhejiang arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, reaching about 2,000 dan. Although the number of silk factories operating in Shanghai is very limited, there seems to be no shortage of new and old cocoons.

### Wuxi Silkworm News Amidst the Announcement of New Cocoons

In recent years, the silkworm silk industry has been thriving due to the sharp depreciation of foreign exchange rates and brisk sales in the United States, with unprecedented profits. This year's situation is no less than in previous years, so people in the industry are even more enthusiastic about management. The launch of new cocoons this year is imminent. Here are some brief notes on the silkworm affairs in Wuxi, the most famous cocoon-producing area in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, for reference.

(1) Silkworm Seed Selection

Silkworm seed selection is most important for breeding farmers. Last year, many breeding farmers purchased mixed brands, resulting in reduced harvests or premature death. Therefore, during the spring period this year, everyone is competing to purchase old-brand silkworm seeds. Among them, the Tiger brand from the Hushu Pass Dayou Seed Farm is the most welcomed by breeding farmers. This brand of seed farm opened at only 3.5 yuan per sheet, but through the manipulation of traffickers, it once rose to over 5 yuan. Mixed-brand seeds are also priced at around 2 yuan. Because of the farmers' distrust, many places lack inquiries, resulting in losses.

(2) Mulberry Leaf Price Increase

As cocoon and silk prices rise, farmers' interest in raising silkworms is more intense than in previous years. Because there was often a shortage in previous years, there are many people planting mulberry seedlings this year. The fertilization work of farmers is also more abundant than in previous years. However, because the amount of silkworms has increased sharply in recent years, the supply of leaves is ultimately insufficient. Therefore, supply and demand are diverging, and leaf prices are also exceeding normal levels. The upward trend is intensifying. The price has reached around 13 yuan in the northern region, and has even reached over 15 yuan per dan in the southern region. Currently, most silkworms are in their third molt, and their bodies are larger and their appetites have increased greatly. The price of mulberry leaves is still rising sharply in the recent days.

(3) Silkworm News from Various Villages

The southwest region, such as Fangju, Banqiao, Zhouxin Town, Fangquan, and Nanqiao, are the origin of silkworm farmers. The breeding aspects and the necessary equipment are superior to other places. Currently, most silkworms are in their third molt, and their bodies are developing well without any signs of disease. If the weather is humid and balanced, the results are expected to be good.

As for the northern region, such as Qianzhou, Beiqifang, Yanqiao, Chenshe, and Zhang Miaoshe, the news is that hatching is slightly later than other places, so most silkworms are in their second molt, and a few have reached their third molt. The situation is very good. It is generally believed that the current price of silk translated into cocoon prices is in the range of 250 yuan to 300 yuan.

(4) Cocoon Firm Registration

Currently, new cocoons are about to enter the market. The Wuxi Bureau convened fellow traders and held a meeting on the 8th to resolve various ongoing matters. It is heard that the registration of cocoon firms will be handled from May 12th to the 20th of this month. If those who open a cocoon business without registering by the deadline are investigated, they will be dealt with severely according to the law. In fact, the so-called registration procedures are actually the manipulative means of the "China Central Company". (Xiang)

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Improves

Yesterday the sugar market was flat, with coarse white sugar slightly improving. Refined white sugar only fluctuated by two to three dimes. The Association's settlement price for spot goods was: local goods of 24 coarse white sugar at 72 yuan to 72.5 yuan, up one yuan; new goods from foreign firms initially at 71.5 yuan to 7.7 yuan, later rising to 72 yuan to 72.12 yuan, and 72.67 yuan; transit goods at 58 yuan to 58.5 yuan, up half a yuan; Taiche White new goods B mark 85 yuan, up three dimes; Eastern firm's old goods traded at 83 yuan for 300 bags; XH mark new goods 83.2 yuan, H mark Red Suger 63 yuan, Dutch Red Suger 66 yuan. The factory's snow white sugar returned to 72.5 yuan. The crystal sugar price remained unchanged. Because domestic sugar production costs are high, and foreign sugar prices are weakening, listing prices are unwilling to weaken, holding firm with no continued sales. The foundation is very solid.

### Dried Goods: Red and Black Dates Continue to Rise

Red and black dates have been tightening recently, continuing to increase. Tianjin red dates opened at more than eighty bags, king dates at 65 yuan, head dates at 55 yuan, first grade at 45 yuan. High-quality dried black dates were scarce, with over a hundred bags being offered, priced at 44 yuan. High-quality Fujian red dates at 28 yuan, ordinary at 26 yuan to 24 yuan.

### Metals Price Decline

Recently, as foreign exchange rates have visibly increased, the selling prices of various goods have generally decreased. The same is true for the prices of metal products. However, sales channels in various regions remain inactive. Yesterday's market transactions were only two to three hundred piculs. Local can factories, printing factories, and toy factories; construction gangs' purchases of steel bars; and local factories' nails, new round bars, binding wire, and cement were all slightly increased. However, the quantities were very small, leading to a lack of market activity and a generally relaxed sentiment. For example, structural steel is selling for 230 yuan per case, new round bars are selling for 68 yuan per picul, nails are selling for 77-78 yuan, black steel billets are at 1,200 yuan, and tinplate is at 260 yuan, all slightly lower than before.

Revisiting Old Newspapers: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (387)

(From this newspaper, published in the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)

### Tiger Escapes Its Cage (Part 2)

The strategist then said, "A dead cow may not be enough to lure the tiger. Why not sacrifice another live cow, and have a group lie in wait by the enclosure? We might then be able to control the tiger's fate." Everyone agreed. The arrangements were made. The day was fading into dusk. Four men, strong and brave, prepared a simple meal, prayed to the heavens, and with weapons at the ready, entered the park. They hid by the enclosure. Twenty quarter-hours passed. The moonlight shimmered on the water. Dry leaves rustled, and withered grass whispered. They looked at each other, their faces pale. Suddenly, the tiger roared again, an even more terrifying sound than the previous day! They listened fearfully. The tiger roamed the park, finding nothing to eat. It circled around to the cow enclosure, saw the live cow, and pounced upon it, fearing it would not die. The cow butted the tiger with its horns. The tiger roared in fury! It bit the cow's head, and the head fell to the ground. The men lying in wait fired their guns, hitting the tiger in the belly. The tiger roared and stumbled. The men fired again, hitting the tiger in the neck. The tiger roared loudly, leapt into the trees, and the forest shook, branches snapping and breaking. Everyone was terrified, and none dared to go and look. They held their breath all night, feeling as though the night was longer than any they had known before. Fortunately, they heard the first cock crow four times, and the light of dawn broke through. They cautiously emerged, spoke to their companions, and finally, clad in armor and with weapons in hand, went to where the tiger had been. The tiger was lying dead in a pool of blood, its claws and teeth bared, a sight that made the onlookers tremble. Nearby, a hundred-year-old tree had its branches and leaves broken and scattered, some of its roots pulled up. Everyone said that the mountain spirit's power had shaken the human world. If not for the cow, how could it have lost its body? Those who are greedy should take this as a warning. However, the fault of the king who raised the tiger cannot be excused either.

To be continued tomorrow.

### The US Attitude After the German Invasion of Holland and Belgium

— Xin Qiong

US Attention Remains Focused on the Pacific

Moral Efforts

The international diplomatic battle has been waged for quite some time, under the assumption that Holland would be invaded by Germany. Now that the fall of Holland has become a reality, the extent to which the menacing prophecies predicted in the diplomatic battle can be implemented naturally has a great bearing on future developments. Previously, the US very much wanted to use pressure to stop Germany from invading Holland, so a part of the population even speculated that this would provoke them to join the war. However, this form of situation arriving is obviously still early. Roosevelt's speech after the German invasion of Holland still only used the language that "foreign aggression has posed a tangible challenge to US civilization," so the US's temporary attitude will likely still be limited to using morality as a weapon.

Pressure on Italy

Naturally, the US's efforts to contain Germany's expansion have not been completely unsuccessful. Hitler clearly expected Italy to launch an offensive in the Mediterranean in response to his offensive in the North Sea. However, after repeated warnings from the US, Italy was forced to delay. It is difficult to say that Italy will remain calm, but Britain and France rely on this a great deal. The US pressure in this regard seems to have some power. This has no relation to whether the US will use force. Italy is one of the most economically deprived countries, and their willingness to be restrained by the US is due to economic reasons.

Attitude towards Britain and France

The US's temporary decision not to use force can also be seen in the measures taken for the territories of Denmark and Holland within the American sphere of influence. When Denmark fell, the US stated that it would protect Iceland, but in the end it was the British and French forces who landed in Iceland. When Holland fell, the US was about to consult with South American countries on how to handle Dutch possessions in the Americas. There are also rumors that British and French forces will land in the Dutch West Indies. It is difficult to say that this is what the US wants, but since the US has not yet made a definitive decision, it will temporarily rely on Britain and France to do as they see fit.

Attitude towards the Far East

The US has made a more decisive attitude towards its concern for the Dutch East Indies. The concentration of a large fleet in the Pacific and the proposal of a large-scale military expansion clearly show that the US prioritizes defense in the Pacific. The obvious goal is to use threats to prevent Japan from advancing south. It is difficult to say whether Britain and France fully understand this. Britain and France are temporarily not implementing protection of the Dutch East Indies. On the one hand, they are wary of Japan. On the other hand, they are waiting for the US to make a decision. For the time being, they are relying on the Dutch East Indies' own claim of strong defense capabilities, coupled with the eastern deployment of the Dutch Navy to strengthen the Dutch East Indies' naval defenses, as a buffer. However, these measures are under the command of Britain and France. The US will eventually need to come up with plans that are more beneficial to the US.

### Perilously Endangered: Europe's Only Neutral Country - Switzerland

— Zhuo

After the German invasion of the neutral countries of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg, Switzerland, the world's only neutral country, remains in its original state. However, it is currently in a precarious situation, and in the near future, it may be drawn into the war and subjected to devastation. The current situation of this endangered small country is described below:

Governance

Switzerland is a federal republic composed of twenty-two cantons. The national governing power is mostly in the hands of the village or district communities, which then generate county councils to handle county affairs (a total of twenty-five counties nationwide). The Upper House members dispatched by the county administrative councils and the Lower House members elected by the people jointly elect the members of the Federal Administrative Council. Finally, the chairman is selected from within this administrative council as the President of the Swiss Republic. The highest federal government only manages foreign affairs, national railways, postal services, customs, currency, and a portion of military and educational affairs.

Cities

The capital is Bern, located on both banks of the Aare River, with extremely beautiful scenery and a prosperous urban condition. Handicrafts such as silk weaving and gemstone carving are famous. The city contains the Universal Postal Union and the Upper and Lower Houses. Other museums, art galleries, universities, and other buildings are all extremely grand and magnificent, with a population of 110,000. Other important cities include the transportation hub of Livorno, the trading center of Basel, the summer resort of Lausanne, the international political cooperation field of Geneva, the world-leading paradise king of Lucerne, and Locarno, where the famous Locarno Security Pact was signed.

Transportation

Mountains overlap and rivers are torrential. Modern transportation is also quite developed in Switzerland. The national railway is 3,500 miles long. Mountain railways and cable cars are set up between the valleys. The mountain railways are for tourists. Cable cars are scattered throughout the mountains, crisscrossing each other, looking like spider webs from afar. People in mountain villages often use these cable cars to transport hay, cheese, and white tower oil. In addition, there is a strange item on Swiss transportation, namely snow sleds, called "Toboggans" in English, which are used exclusively on snowy ground. In many places, mailmen deliver mail, students go to school, and women go to market, all riding on these sleds.

Industry and Commerce

More than 48 percent of the Swiss people are engaged in industry and commerce, so in Europe, Switzerland can also be called the most industrially developed country, except for Britain and Belgium. The most famous are metallurgy and weaving, followed by the world-famous watch industry. Many farmers often find handicrafts to do during their agricultural leisure time. Therefore, wood carving, ivory carving, grass weaving, lace making, hemp spinning, and weaving are also very developed in Switzerland.

### Gains and Losses of the German Invasion of Holland and Belgium

— Fang Qi

The Old Battlefield of Waterloo Again Becomes a Place of Bloodshed

The rapid changes of the past week have almost made people forget that the German invasion of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg only occurred eight days ago. The exaggeration and fragmentary nature of war news have made even American news agencies, for whom news is the third-largest industry, only say that "due to the breadth of the war zone and the rapid German penetration into various locations, it is impossible to immediately accurately estimate the scope of the war zone and the actual numbers of troops on both sides." Even so, the combined area of the three countries - Holland, with over 12,000 square miles; Belgium, with over 11,000 square miles; and Luxembourg, with 1,000 square miles - is less than 25,500 square miles. The length from Groningen in the northernmost part of Holland to Dudelange in the southernmost part of Luxembourg is 300 miles. The distance from Aachen, on the border between Holland, Belgium, and Germany, northwest to The Hague is less than 150 miles, and southwest to Sedan is only a little over 100 miles. This war zone is not larger than the triangular area of Tanghe, Xinyang, and Zhongxiang on the border between Henan and Hubei provinces in China. The forces used by Germany in this area are probably only 300,000 to 500,000.

The center of gravity of the war is in the area west of Aachen. The first important city captured by Germany was Maastricht, directly west of Aachen, in the bastion area where the southern part of Holland protrudes between Germany and Belgium. After that, Germany developed with this as the center. The northeasternmost part of Holland was quickly occupied by Germany without fierce fighting. There was no retreat in this area, and therefore no method of defense. Luxembourg was also easily occupied by Germany. Although French news said that the Allies would advance to Luxembourg, it was just empty talk. The direction of the Moselle River shows that this is an unfavorable area for a counteroffensive. However, because Nancy is an important French military town, Germany did not continue south from Luxembourg. If Germany's advance in the center was not very smooth, then it would have been necessary to invade westward with heavy troops from Luxembourg. But since Germany broke through the Albert Canal and surrounded Liège, France and Belgium had no room to counterattack from this route. Therefore, Germany surrounded the Ardennes Mountains to the southwest along the Meuse River, and the troops in the Belgian province of Luxembourg had no choice but to retreat west of the Meuse River. Germany was then able to obtain the Ardennes Mountains with little effort, and then directly approached Sedan to attack France. The extension of the Maginot Line had been broken through, making the whole world focus on this historically famous battlefield. But as it stands now, Germany may not want to break through immediately. The most urgent problem to be solved is another famous historical battlefield: Waterloo, or rather, the area around Brussels (the Belgian capital). The Allied reinforcements are concentrated in that area, and Germany must either prevail or fail in that area. It is natural for the Allied side to prevent repeating the mistakes of the last European war, and it seems that Germany has not been able to adopt another strategy.

In the last European war, Germany considered France to be more important than Britain. This time, it considers Britain to be more important than France. The occupation of Holland was clearly for the sake of Britain, which is naturally different from the situation in the last European war. However, it is difficult to estimate how much damage having Holland as a base will cause to Britain. The use of air force to subdue a country is still largely a fantasy. Germany's claim that the invasion of Holland was to prevent Britain and France from passing through Holland is not just an excuse. This is what Germany really feared, but Britain seems to not intend to implement this plan, even if it had it. It provoked Germany to break the neutrality of other countries, so it had a good excuse to defend against Germany and to retain the right to inspect Chinese ships in order to increase the effectiveness of its blockade. Of the world's 68 million tons of ships, most belong to the nine major shipping countries. Now that Britain and France have re-manipulated the ships of Holland, Denmark, and Belgium, they have exceeded half of the tonnage. Adding the supporting United States and subtracting the Germany, whose ships cannot move freely, Britain and France have more than one-third of the tonnage that they are manipulating. If a blockade can truly lead to victory, then Germany will inevitably cut off its own path. Holland's fall, while Britain remains calm, may be because Britain believes that it has benefited. But once Britain understands that the effectiveness of a blockade is limited, then Britain will have suffered a heavy blow.

### Mussolini

### Hitler

### Grand Duchy of Luxembourg

— Mitten

The very name "Grand Duchy" indicates that Luxembourg is a feudal remnant. During Napoleon's reign, it belonged to France, and later joined the German Confederation. However, it did not side with Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War, and thus, after the war (1867), it became an appendage of the Netherlands and subsequently an independent country. At that time, Germany not only did not foresee the later industrialization of the Rhineland but also did not anticipate the creation of the German Empire. Therefore, it did not pay much attention to this small land. After the Franco-Prussian War (1870), when Prussia acquired Alsace-Lorraine, Luxembourg was surrounded on three sides by Germany but still managed to maintain its independence, merely by luck. During the European War from 1914 to 1918, if the German side had not failed, Luxembourg's independence would have inevitably ended. This time, being occupied by Germany again, it seems that it cannot be restored unless Germany is defeated, so the Grand Duchess can only flee to France.

Shen Bao Sunday Supplement Special Issue on National Goods - Fang Yexian

### Memorial Issue for Mr. Chen Xuyuan - Mourning Mr. Chen Xuyuan

— Shen Yu

Before the establishment of the Home Industries Society in the country, Mr. Xuyuan was one of the few prominent men of letters in the Southeast. After the establishment of the Home Industries Society, Mr. Xuyuan became a nationally known industrialist. These are two distinct periods in the life history of Mr. Chen. The story of Mr. Chen's founding of the Home Industries Society and the hardships of its operation is well known to those who know a little about Mr. Chen's life. Zhou Zishou Juan and Xie Zitihong recorded it in great detail, so I need not add anything more. I only think that Mr. Chen started with a small industry and achieved such great success that he is now listed among the major industrialists in Shanghai. This was by no means accidental. The world only knows that Mr. Chen laid the foundation for his career with Invincible Brand Facial Cleansing Tooth Powder, but they do not know that Mr. Chen's intention in making tooth powder the first product at that time was profound and not merely for the sake of profit. Subsequently, the products launched after Invincible Brand Tooth Powder were almost all aimed at imported goods, which shows his painstaking efforts even more. With this painstaking effort and a spirit of perseverance, coupled with his keen acumen and strategy, he accumulated strength and eventually achieved greatness, making the national goods industry a strong bulwark. The people of the country were gradually influenced by Mr. Chen's transformation and also rose up to devote themselves to the production of national goods. As the saying goes, "The enlightened awaken those who are not yet enlightened," Mr. Chen is perhaps one of them. Since the decline of the world, people often criticize scholars as useless. Today, Mr. Chen is also a scholar, but his achievements are so outstanding that he can somewhat dispel the shame of scholars. I knew Mr. Chen more than twenty years ago, introduced by Mr. Liu Liren, an old friend of Mr. Chen. We often traveled and banqueted together. At that time, the Home Industries Society was just starting, and Mr. Chen often happily talked about his insights into chemistry, speaking tirelessly and with profound insights that often surpassed expectations. Later, as the business of the Home Industries Society expanded and many things fell on him, and I also became ill and lazy, we stopped associating with each other. Last year, Mr. Chen returned from Yunnan, and I repeatedly thought about visiting him but did not succeed. By the time Mr. Chen fell ill and passed away, I had not heard of it beforehand. On the day of the funeral, I heard the news too late and did not have time to attend the mourning, which can be said to have failed Mr. Chen greatly. Now, I include a poem in the style of seven-character ancient verse to mourn Mr. Chen. Although it is not enough to fully express Mr. Chen's life, it is at least a way to show the traces of our past interactions.

Mr. Chen's poetry and prose flowed like Xiang Ru, his talent and fame shook the nine continents in his early years. Like Yuan Mei from his hometown, his quick talent produced writings like a whistling wind. He would try writing thousands of words every day, entrusting them to the pencil and paper, and at that time, countless letters were sent racing through the stars. A true man praises books for their usefulness, holding onto dead phrases is not my kind. Only you, sir, were well-versed and thorough in both ancient and modern times, and in your later years, you pursued in-depth research into the physical world. With deep resentment towards our enemies, you were able to open up new paths in the use of things. Jade-like and snow-white, spreading to ten thousand mouths, the merits of sages of old who used stones to brush their teeth should be praised. As the world declines and households become isolated, the sound of weaving machines is no longer heard, and who in the neighborhoods and lanes is able to repair them? Mr. Chen, you devised plans to advise against the trend of laziness, creating a model workshop to leave behind good strategies. Shi Yi and Tao Zhu were not the only ones who excelled, a wise man opens up all things for the benefit of the multitudes. The world has long suffered from the uselessness of scholars, reciting benevolence and righteousness cannot satisfy hunger. Although Han Gao is dead, the criticism has not ceased, you rose up to wash away the shame of the scholars. Alas, how can scholars be useless? All things in ancient and modern times follow Ke Qiu, from writing to graduation, everything is consistent, and your achievements are indeed due to this. Long ago, I became acquainted with you through Mr. Liu (Liren), our relationship transcended age and was exceptionally kind. Tall and majestic like a pine tree standing tall, clear words were often exchanged as we raised our clear cups in toast. Since our separation, the years have been filled with wandering, and for twenty years, I have dreamed of the Yuan Long Tower. Since experiencing turmoil and scattering, you also traveled far to Sichuan and Yunnan, last year you returned from the south of the sky, the mountains and rivers were collected in your satchel. The vicissitudes of life lingered in my mind, and as I looked up, the river clouds floated dimly. Alas, I am clumsy and lazy, and neglected to inquire, sitting in shame as a former seagull on the riverbank. Mr. Chen did not wait for the Yellow River to become clear, and upon suddenly hearing the news, tears welled up in my eyes. Moreover, I still owe you a farewell at the coffin, and I am truly to blame for this. I believe that your spirit is immortal, and it is not only your poetry that remains in this world. The two Nan brothers rose up one after another, both exceptionally talented, and Yuan Fang's discussions on art were especially comprehensive. Your lofty morality illuminates the customs of the time, and your heroic spirit will remain for a thousand autumns. I heard that you have a living tomb by the West Lake, where plum blossoms are reflected by the pines and autumn leaves. Now the flames of war prevent your bones from returning, and the green mountains hold resentment, when will they be cleansed?

### Autobiography of Tianxu Wosheng

I am the third son of the Yuehu Gong family, a tribute student attached to Qiantang County. I was recommended twice but failed the examinations, and after the abolition of the imperial examination system, I ended my life as a laborer. I have always been skilled in poetry, prose, lyrics, and songs, but I do not boast about it. Throughout my life, I have regarded rectifying my heart and making my intentions sincere, being always loyal and trustworthy, as my heavenly duty. In all things and matters, I want to exhaust their principles to the fullest extent of my knowledge. Therefore, I am skilled in many arts, but they are not useful to the world, so I call myself Tianxu Wosheng (Heavenly Void I Am Born). My medical writings are named Xu, my literary name is Diexian, and my surname is Chen. It is said that I am a descendant of Emperor Shun, so I can discard fame and fortune and make the whole family live with tolerance. Is this also a hereditary trait? I married a woman from the Zhu family and have two sons. The elder is named Qu, literary name Xiaodie, and the younger is named Cidié. My daughter's literary name is Jun. People who praise her often compare her to the Su family of Meishan.

### Chronology of Entrepreneurship

The wise son of Mr. Xu, the tenth gentleman, recently wrote a chronology of his late father, which describes his life in great detail. Now, for the sake of this publication, we will extract the process of his dedication to hard work and record it below, calling it the Chronology of Entrepreneurship.

Year 2 of the Republic of China (Gui Chou), Mr. Chen was thirty-five years old. He traveled as a staff member in Yue, and in the autumn, he went to Zhenhai, where he assisted Mr. Qian Shou Xuan as a staff member, and served for a year as the acting magistrate. Once, while walking along the seashore, he saw vast amounts of cuttlefish bones. At that time, Diamond Tooth Powder was selling well, and the annual income of the customs exceeded one million yuan. Mr. Chen said: "This can be taken and replaced." So he presented a request to the government, asking to retain the surplus salt to establish a vocational training center for criminals, using cuttlefish bone powder as tooth powder, calling it Invincible Brand. People laughed at him, saying: "Why spend tens of thousands of yuan annually on such a trivial matter?" The Standing Bureau heard about this and obstructed it, so he resigned. He went to Shanghai to assist Mr. Shi Liangcai in editing the Shen Bao.

Year 7 (Wu Wu), Mr. Chen was forty years old. He compiled the "Home Knowledge" and published 100,000 copies, which sold out in half a month. The world began to recognize that Mr. Chen was proficient in physics and chemistry and not just known for his writing. In this year, he founded the Home Industries Society, aiming to replace machines with handicrafts so that everyone in the common people's lives could have food to eat. He invented Invincible Brand Facial Cleansing Tooth Powder. Mrs. Lan Yun was in charge of inspection, Xiaodie sieved the powder, and the children of the family were all workers. Within half a year, it spread throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River, and his poetry and writing became scarce.

Year 8 (Yi Wei), Mr. Chen was forty-one years old. He founded the Home Box-Making Factory.

Year 9 (Geng Shen), Mr. Chen was forty-two years old. He founded the First Magnesium Factory in Wuxi.

Year 10 (Xin You), Mr. Chen was forty-three years old. He used inexpensive methods to achieve great results, and Mr. Chen's energy began to be spent here. In this year, he built the Half Mu Garden on the lake, and there is a collection of poems called "Half Mu Garden Collection."

Year 18 (Ji Si), Mr. Chen was fifty-one years old. He and Mr. Xiang Songmao, Shen Jiucheng, and others founded the Joint Factory of Machine-Made National Goods in Shanghai, and there was a meeting of the Machine Joint Association. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce hired him as a member of the Chamber of Commerce.

Year 19 (Geng Wu), Mr. Chen was fifty-two years old. He founded the Huiquan Soda Factory.

Year 13 (Jia Zi), Mr. Chen was forty-six years old. He founded the Invincible Glass Factory.

Year 15 (Bing Yin), Mr. Chen was forty-eight years old. He founded the Liyong Paper Mill.

Year 16 (Ding Mao), the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and Mr. Chen was forty-nine years old. He founded the Invincible Brand Mosquito Coil Factory in Zhenjiang.

Year 17 (Wu Chen), Mr. Chen was fifty years old. He welcomed Mr. Li Xinpu to join as an unlimited liability shareholder of the Home Industries Society and devoted himself exclusively to the paper-making business until his death, for twelve years without interruption. His goal was to use manual labor to utilize rice straw and bamboo in various villages and towns, adapting to local conditions to create pulp and replace foreign paper, assisting the development of culture. The machines used were all designed with ingenuity. From Ding Mao to Geng Wu, he mostly lived in Ronghu Village in Liangxi, and he and his fourth uncle Rongxuan successfully operated the paper-making business. Small crafts and small series of books were published.

Year 25 (Bing Zi), Mr. Chen was fifty-eight years old. While living in Hangzhou, his old friend Mr. Xu Qingfu was the head of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Director of Construction, Wang Chunbo, and the Mayor, Zhou Qiyu, were all close friends with Qu. They invited Mr. Chen to serve as a design committee member, improving manual paper-making throughout Zhejiang Province. He and his second son, Zu, surveyed the land at Fancun at the foot of Mount Wuyun and established the Provincial Model Paper Mill, which was successful the following year. The Jiangxi Provincial Government also hired Mr. Chen to design and establish a model manual paper mill in Nanchang, and there were lectures on model paper-making.

Year 26 (Ding Chou), Mr. Chen was fifty-nine years old. He collected his poems, prose, and miscellaneous writings since Jia Xu and published the "59th Anniversary Collection." He was hired by the Central Government as a design committee member of the Ministry of Industry. In the spring, he went to Nanjing as a member of the handicraft review committee, and in the summer, he went to the lake. In the autumn of that year, the August 13th Incident occurred, and his eldest son, Qu, accompanied Mr. Chen from Hangzhou to Hankou. He then went upstream along the Yangtze River to Junqing and ordered his disciple Li Shaoguang to establish a model paper mill in Hejiang, and his nephew Zu'en to improve manual paper-making in Jiading. Wherever Mr. Chen passed, the gray and yellow paper was all turned white. In the winter, he went to Chengdu, staying at the Fengwu Thatched Cottage of the Jiang family.

### Crying for Uncle Chen Xuyuan

— Zhou Shoujuan

Leading the literary world for forty autumns, the lyrics and prose of Jiangguan are naturally clear and graceful. Since you left, sir, the sound of chanting has become silent, and the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village. (Uncle's Shanghai residence was in Golden Valley Village on Jin Shenfu Road.)

The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village. You let go of everything and rested in peace, and your poetic soul has transformed into a Zhuang Zhou butterfly, freely roaming the two prefectures of Bai.

A family of elegance and happiness, composing poems and competing in rhymes with leisurely intentions, but now where is the person who strikes the bowl, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village.

The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, but you have already relieved yourself of all worries. Your coffin is closed, and there is no shame or regret, and your strong integrity and yellow chrysanthemums adorn the late autumn.

Poetry boxes and zither bags leave behind your handwriting, and the death of a person and the existence of things breed deep sorrow. The literary fish sobs, and the literary birds weep, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village. (Uncle also loved fish and birds, placing birdcages next to his seat, feeding them himself, and also placing a crystal tank, raising many small goldfish, enjoying their sight.)

The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, what more can you ask for after achieving success and fame? Your skill in public transportation is truly invincible, leaving behind the fragrance of teeth in ten continents.

Traveling thousands of miles in exile with a healthy waist and feet, you took Qingyou as your leisure in Sichuan and Yunnan. Where is Yuan Long's heroic spirit now, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village.

The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, and the spring is lonely like deep autumn, only because heaven took away Chen Jingzuo, and there is no more heroic talk that pierces the Bullfight.

Diligently and diligently until your white head, copying scriptures and writing poems from morning till night without rest, and now the pen and inkstone are all idle, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village.

The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, and the tears of the spoiled girl of the Zuo family are difficult to collect, the fallen flowers and drizzle make people live long, can there be new lyrics to send to the Cuilou. (When Uncle discussed lyrics with me, he said that in the collection of Yan Jidao, only the two lines "Fallen flowers and people standing alone, light rain and swallows flying in pairs" are the best. The day Uncle died was also when there was light rain and swallows flying in pairs. Usually, Uncle would always show his works to his daughter, Ms. Cuina, who is also skilled in rhyme, and has works such as "Cuilou Yin Cao.")

Only when you die do you know that happiness comes from Sichuan, and life is originally like a floating bubble, but sadly, the family and country have many regrets, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village.

The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, how can one bear to trace the dust dream from the beginning, last night I endured listening to the flute of Shanyang, and my heart broke over the old tavern by the West Lake. (I used to travel with Uncle to the West Lake and often drank in Louwailou.)

Everything is like yesterday's death, and the wise words are clearly remembered in my heart, and now who can comfort me in my suffering, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village. (Whenever I encountered unsatisfactory things, I would tell Uncle about them, and Uncle would always comfort me with the phrase "Like yesterday's death.")

The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, when will your bones return to your old homeland Qiu, the poet should accompany Bu Xian to leave, and sing and play in the autumn grave under the moonlight. (Uncle has a living tomb built on Taoyuan Ridge on the lake, called Diechao, but the flames of war have not yet subsided, and I don't know when it will be possible to be buried there.)

Year 27 (Wu Yin), Mr. Chen was sixty years old, from Sichuan and Yunnan, living in Jiang Xiaojian's Lingjian New Pavilion, accompanied by his eldest son Qu. Yunnan salt contains a lot of Glauber's salt, and those who eat it have heavy throats, so Mr. Chen set up an improved salt refinery in Anning Prefecture, and also wanted to use trifoliate orange and sugar cane to make paper, but it failed before it was completed, and Mr. Chen sighed. In the autumn, he went to Hong Kong, and in the winter, he returned to Shanghai, publishing the "Ershun Collection." Wherever he passed through Hanyu and Yunnan, he established branch factories of the Home Industries Society, ordering his eldest son Qu to manage them. By the time he returned to Shanghai, the transportation between Chongqing and Yunnan was greatly obstructed, and the Invincible Brand Southwest goods relied on the branch factories to be self-sufficient.

Year 28 (Ji Mao), Mr. Chen was sixty-one years old, lamenting that his hometown could not be returned to, so he lived in Shanghai, often saying: "Business is a public instrument of society. I entrust the Home Industries Society to Xinpu, which is also the meaning of our former sages Yu Shan Yu, and I can have no regrets." Only the improved paper-making industry, which is the essence of my life's work, has no one to inherit my will. His eldest son Lian and Xing gathered funds with his friend Ding Huikang Xu Bangda to set up a factory, and all the plans were drawn up by Mr. Chen, based on his original intention, to popularize small-capital factories in the interior, so that everyone can easily obtain food and clothing. Therefore, it was named Dasheng Company; Mr. Chen was also seriously ill.

### Where are You Going? (1)

"For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few." Every year, countless students graduate from universities and middle schools during the summer vacation. When they receive their diplomas from the principal and return to their seats, their friends will ask them a question that concerns their future, which is, "Where are you going?" Since their numbers are so large, the paths they take are naturally different. Some are advancing on the road to success, some are traveling on the road to failure, some are walking the road to life, and some are going to the road to death. Someone said, "There is a way that seems not bad, but in the end, it is a dead end." He also said, "The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, gradually becoming brighter and brighter, until it is completely bright." The path of sinners is gradually difficult, while the path of good people is developing day by day. Jesus once proclaimed to the world with his wise eyes that there are two paths in the world: one is wide and easy to walk, leading to destruction, and many people walk it; the other is narrow and difficult to walk, leading to eternal life, but few people find it. Education may enable us to be suitable for a certain kind of work, but when we go to find work with our diplomas, we may not be able to find any. This is because finding suitable work has a lot to do with whether there is an opportunity. However, young people want to be determined to be people, and this authority is in their own hands, and they don't need to rely on opportunity. Therefore, we should not only look at this chaotic world where the door of opportunity is closed, we should look inward and upward, and bravely be the kind of person we want to be. If we have such determination, our inner world will sooner or later affect this outer world. Because a person's success or failure depends more on his inner spiritual power than on the work he is engaged in. (To be continued)

### What Should We Do in the Midst of Soaring Prices?

— Wen

Children, in this time of soaring prices of rice, pearls, firewood, and cinnamon, when parents are worried about firewood and rice all day long, should we still be ignorant children, reaching out our hands for money, randomly buying snacks to eat, or wanting to buy pencils and notebooks at any moment, increasing the burden on our parents? No, we must be children who know the times. Although we cannot share our parents' economic burden, we should try our best to save and reduce our parents' burden. The following are a few things that we should do at this time, and they are the most common and achievable.

1. Strive for Learning: Children! Let us calculate how much the tuition fee is for each semester. I think the cost of schooling for an average elementary school student is probably around fifty or sixty yuan per year. For families with many sisters and brothers, the cost of education is very considerable. Parents cultivate us through extreme hardship and by saving every penny. If we are not willing to work hard and discipline ourselves, and when the end of school comes, our grades are not up to par and we cannot advance to the next grade, or we have to drop out of school because of this, it will be too late to regret it.

2. Take Care of Clothing and Supplies: Children's clothing and supplies are the most expensive. A piece of clothing gets torn in a few days, a new pair of shoes gets torn in less than a week, and a new book gets torn into pieces in less than a month. Other wastes, such as pencils, erasers, and notebooks, cannot be listed one by one. In short, all the supplies for children are more expensive than those for adults. What is the reason? First, children do not know the difficulty of where they come from. Second, they do not know how to use them properly. For example, a new brush pen should be washed clean with water before and after use. When it is glued by ink, it is put in the mouth and bitten, and the brush hairs are bitten off and fall out, so it cannot be written again. Now the price of a brush pen and a pencil has also increased several times. If you are not willing to use them carefully and carefully, using a pencil as several, and wearing a piece of clothing as two, you may not be able to afford to buy them in the future.

3. Forge and Protect Your Body: The surge in medical expenses is not something that ordinary families can afford. Therefore, we must forge and protect our bodies. (1) Regarding forging: Because of environmental reasons, there is no large venue for us to exercise. We can take advantage of the time when there are few people in the early morning and the air is fresh to hold morning exercises in the patio or on the balcony. And develop the habit of walking, because walking can help digestion and promote blood circulation, it is a good full-body exercise. (2) Regarding protection: Eat on time, choose nutritious foods, such as green vegetables and tofu, and do not eat leadership affairs. In summer, get various vaccinations to prevent the spread of diseases. 3. Make full use of waste: We often see children picking up garbage on the road, finding broken cloths and broken glass in the trash cans. These dirty and broken things are taken to be sorted and transformed into practical and beautiful supplies to sell to us. Therefore, if we need any utensils or toys, we should try our best to collect useless waste in our homes, create or copy them, and do our best. Sometimes we can get what we hope for without spending a penny.

### A Chemical Story

— Zhu Kaiqing

Children: Now I will report to you an interesting thing, which was told to me in a letter from my friend in Shaanxi.

My friend lives in Xi'an, Shaanxi. He wrote in a letter: "... Once, I went to visit the famous historical site of the Tang Dynasty—Huaqing Pool—with my sisters. There are hot springs gushing out there (locals sometimes take them to bathe because the hot springs contain sulfur, which can treat skin diseases; such as: scabies, psoriasis, etc., this is the so-called mineral bath). When we walked there and were enjoying the scenery, suddenly I looked up and saw that the white powder on my sisters' faces had turned into a layer of black ash. I felt very strange at the time..." I got this news myself, and I was also very curious and couldn't think of a reason for a while. I ran to ask the chemistry teacher, and he replied: "Because ordinary inferior powder contains alkaline lead carbonate (commonly known as lead white), and the hot springs contain sulfur. When the weather is clear, it is evaporated by the sun's rays and becomes hydrogen sulfide gas, which spreads into the air. When hydrogen sulfide encounters lead white, it undergoes a chemical change and turns black. They must have applied inferior powder, so this happened. And because inferior powder contains lead, it is toxic and should not be used." I suddenly understood this question. Children, you must love beauty and like to apply powder! However, according to my teacher, ordinary inferior powder contains lead and is toxic and should not be used; then buying more expensive powder is too expensive; especially at a time when prices are soaring. So I advise you, you might as well save and save the money used to apply powder.

### Don't Ever Use the Road as a Playground!

— Xin Liang

Children, after you finish reading in school, do you go home immediately? Or, do you like to gather three or four classmates to play on the side of the road or at the end of the alley? I think, in reality, there must be many, many young classmates who specialize in happily playing "rolling water chestnuts" and "building houses" on the road.

Here, let me report a fact to you all. Wang Er, who lives next door to my house, was playing "rolling water chestnuts" on the road with two classmates. A car drove from a distance, and he didn't notice it at all. By the time his attention shifted from the water chestnuts to the "doo...doo..." car horn, he originally wanted to avoid it immediately, but it was too late. Suddenly, the heavily loaded car rushed straight at him. He could only fall to the ground, letting the car roll over his arm. This poor Wang Er is still being treated in the hospital. His parents have already spent hundreds of dollars on him, and he himself has lost a precious arm. Moreover, he has also wasted a lot of schoolwork! In addition, he has to suffer in the hospital.

"The road is like the mouth of a tiger!" This sentence is not wrong at all! The road is very dangerous, and none of us children should use it as a playground. Even if you want to do some recreation in your spare time, you should jump and play in the campus or in the table tennis room, playing table tennis. You can't play on the road under any circumstances!

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (3)

— Min

But even when I had free time, I didn't want to go play on that frequently visited beach. There were just too many people surrounding me, making it unbearable. I remember one summer when we went to Balboa—a beach not far from Los Angeles. Dad's bank happened to have a holiday, so we stayed there for two weeks. I played on the sand with the other children, and we had a lot of fun. I told them my name was Shirley, and they each told me their names too. One morning, a lady stood in front of me and exclaimed, "Oh my! You look just like Shirley Temple!"

I thought it was funny, so I smiled at the lady and said, "Yes, that's me—Shirley Temple." The lady was dubious and stunned for a minute or two, then she came over and looked at me carefully from head to toe. Then she saw my mom and dad standing nearby and became so excited she couldn't speak. Finally, she took a small booklet out of her purse and asked if they would allow me to sign it for her. Mom agreed and called me over. I was happily digging a sand tunnel with the children when I heard Mom's call. I immediately stopped and hurried over to sign my name in the lady's booklet. At that time, I couldn't write very well yet, so signing my name was difficult. It took me a while just to sign "Love—Shirley Temple." After the lady saw me finish writing, she was very grateful and thanked me again and again, saying that she had a niece in the East who was about my age and would be so happy to know that she had spoken to the real Shirley Temple.

After she left, I went back to digging the tunnel. Before long, many people came over. Some just walked by and glanced at me, while others shouted, "Hello, Shirley!" I replied with a "Hello," but I really wanted to say to them, "Please don't bother me, can't you see I'm busy digging a tunnel?" But they had already taken out pencils and booklets, bending down to beg me to sign their names. Just as I was at a loss, Mom came over and softly told them that I couldn't sign any more autographs today because it was time for my afternoon nap and we had to go back. So we went back to the hotel together. Actually, it wasn't time for my afternoon nap yet, but Mom was using that as an excuse to get me away. Dad held me on his lap and said, "Sweetheart, this is because you are already famous." Then he read a story from a book to me. I kept looking out the window, thinking how fun it would be to play on the beach a little longer and finish digging the tunnel.

When I was very young, we lived in Santa Monica. Mom and Dad often took my little table and chair to the beach. Can you guess why? Let me tell you, it was because I always had lunch in the sunlight, sitting at my own little table. Mom brought a big thermos filled with soup, porridge, or vegetables for me to eat, all hot. She said she always wanted me to eat at a certain time, so I wouldn't miss a meal even when we were away from home. Did you know that when I first started making movies (when I was only three and a half years old), Mom always brought this thermos to the set? Other women sometimes laughed at my mom for being too careful about my food, but she didn't care. She always carried the thermos with her and said, "Regardless of whether we are at a movie set or not, my darling must eat well."

### My Humble Opinion for the Yifeng Society

— Only Me

The Yifeng Society of Carlton recently had six members leave: Liang Ciyou, Li Wenjun, Ma Jinfeng, Wang Zhongping, Wang Zhongying, and Cao Mukun. The departure of these six has greatly affected the Yifeng Society's performances. Qilin Tong sings male roles with beards, and the most important thing for these roles is the small painted face (just like the most important thing for female roles is the young male actor). Especially for Carlton, who specializes in new plays, the clown role is even more important. Among the six who left the Yifeng Society this time, three are small painted-face actors.

In the past, Qilin Tong had two inseparable small painted-face actors: one was Zhou Wubao and the other was Liu Binkun. Both of these men were top-notch clown talents in the Jiangnan area. Qilin Tong's past achievements were greatly due to these two small painted-face actors. Since the Yifeng Society performed at Carlton, Zhou Wubao left due to illness. The small painted-face lineup was Liu Binkun, Li Hansan, Liang Cishan, Wang Zhongying, and Cao Mukun. Among them, Li Hansan's salary was higher than Liang, Wang, and Cao. But his skills were worthless. Liang Cishan and Wang Zhongying are two rising stars who are not bad. So losing Zhou Wubao did not cause too much of a problem for Qilin Tong's performances. Later, unfortunately, Liu Binkun also left, giving the Yifeng Society a major blow. At the same time, the Yifeng Society also knew that Li Hansan could not hold up the overall situation, so they invited Zhu Baisui to join as a temporary replacement. However, Zhu Baisui was then invited to perform in other places and left. This created Liang Cishan's position. Although Li Hansan's salary was higher than Liang Cishan's, the audience welcomed Cishan more than Hansan. As a result, the Yifeng Society relied heavily on Cishan. Now that Cishan has left, along with Wang Zhongying and Cao Mukun, the Yifeng Society is left with only Li Hansan out of the four basic clowns. One can imagine how this will affect the Yifeng Society.

Now, it is said that the Yifeng Society has invited replacements. One is called Cao Huilin, the son of the old actor Cao Fuchen, who originally studied clean roles and also works as a clown. His skills seem to be inferior to Liang Cishan's. Shen Zhixian has the same position and artistic style as Wang Zhongying, so the replacement is quite appropriate. Out of my deep love for Qilin Tong's art, I would like to offer some advice. Liang Cishan's vacancy has not yet been filled, and a suitable person should be invited as soon as possible. It would be best to borrow Jiao Baokui from the Great Stage, or borrow Qin Suogui from the Gong Stage. He is also an old partner of Qilin Tong and his skills are quite good. Moreover, the Gong Stage has many small painted-face actors, so it would be fine to borrow him from there. If the Yifeng Society does not want to borrow people from other troupes, then it would be better to invite Zhu Baisui to join again. He is familiar with the role and is better than nothing.

### Silver Train

— Xinggu

Ma Xiewei Bang told reporters that the sequel to "Midnight Song" is 30% complete. After this film is finished, he may change his style and switch to ancient historical films. Because some people say that he can only direct horror films and cannot direct other films, this has aroused his ambition to direct ancient films and he is preparing to adopt more progressive historical themes.

Chen Yunshang returned to Shanghai and is resting at home every day due to travel fatigue. Li Minghui accompanies her to chat every afternoon, but in a week, "Su Wu Shepherding Sheep" may start filming. The male lead is still Mei Xi, playing Su Wu, and Chen plays the princess. After this film is completed, the next films scheduled are "The Creation of the World" and "Lady Huarui." After filming, Yunshang still wants to return to Hong Kong, because she has already agreed to a company's invitation. Before coming to Shanghai, she only filmed one film, "The Romantic Empress," in Hong Kong.

Yang Xiaozhong is actively rushing to film "Sui Palace Spring Colors," which is not yet finished. He has already been attacked because the words "Spring Colors" are somewhat indecent. However, according to the screenwriter Chen Dabei, the plot of "Sui Palace Spring Colors" does not have any bad taste.

Last night, Sheng Pihua and Zhang Shankun hosted a banquet for Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Weiru, and others, as well as Chen Yunshang, Chen Yanyan, Tong Yuejuan, Li Hong, Lu Luming, Li Minghui, etc. Lin Kanghou was invited to give a speech, and Chen Yunshang thanked everyone. The banquet ended happily after ten o'clock.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 24: The Lakes and Mountains are Swept Clean, Each with its Own Charm; The Scholars and Ladies Cheer Together, Calling "Long Live"

Their group came to the house of the triplets again. These three little brothers had also learned the etiquette of bowing and shaking hands. Zhu Airen then gave them a set of clay figurines that Mrs. Xue of Wuxi had given her. They each held one, with one saying: "It looks like you," and another saying: "It looks like him," but they didn't know that they all looked like themselves. Ms. Kang Ning, who was raising the three children, said: "If I give them to you to play with, they will all be broken in less than three days. Give them all to me, and I will put them in a glass case to display tomorrow." The three children obediently handed them over to Ms. Kang Ning. At that time, Shao Huihua was even more excited, hugging one and then another, and took several photos of them. Later, she also took a photo of Ms. Kang Ning, who was raising the three little treasures. She also asked Ms. Tong Haiying, the director of the kindergarten, to take a photo. Although Shao Huihua had followed Jin Dan'e's honeymoon trip to Anle Town, she was also collecting materials for the newspaper. When she went back, she was planning to write an article, and these photos were her illustrations. It was already 3:30 PM. They left Anle Town and were going to Freedom Village. When Zhu Airen was making a long-distance call to Old Jing Shengshi in Huzhou, she also casually mentioned that she was going to Baiyoutong and asked Old Zhang Physician to tell her grandfather. Therefore, Zhu Village Chief already knew. At this time, the two He sisters were a little anxious, thinking that they were only concerned with delaying, and by the time they got to Freedom Village, it would be night. How could they see the factory site then? But Zhu Airen was paying attention, and urged them. Moreover, although Zhu Airen had returned to the hospital, she still accompanied them to Freedom Village. Fortunately, it only took about ten minutes to get from Anle Town to Freedom Village. The family travel car passed along the way, seeing the neat roads and lush forests, they knew that this village was well-managed. Today, Zhu Village Chief was hosting them at the Freedom Village Elementary School, intending to let them see the intentions of this elementary school, and also wanted to keep them for dinner. Although he hadn't told them in advance, he knew that they would be returning to Shanghai from Freedom Village. When they returned to Shanghai, they would also be having dinner, so why not have a meal here? By the time they arrived at Freedom Village, Old Mr. Zhu had told his granddaughter Zhu Airen about keeping them for dinner. Zhu Airen thought: Anyway, they are not going anywhere else, so it doesn't matter. However, the taste of the countryside may not be enough to entertain the guests.
