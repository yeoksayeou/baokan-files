Editorial

### Vietnam, Hong Kong, and the International Situation

"International attention has shifted from Romania to the Far East," is a signal recently issued by London. The Far Eastern situation has suddenly made the international community feel tense. In fact, the tension in the Far East began with the September 18th Incident nine years ago, or at least with the July 7th Incident three years ago. How could it have started now? The tension that the international community feels now is only because French Indochina and British Hong Kong are under threat. In fact, British and French territories have long been threatened. Even in terms of direct threats, it began with the Japanese army's attack on Guangdong in October of the year before last. In the past, the international community ignored the essence of aggression and anti-aggression, and did not know that if the essence of aggression changes even for a day, and if those who resist aggression do not curb it but tolerate its spread, then space will have no boundaries, and time will have no distinction between past and present, and eventually disaster will befall them. The safety and danger of the international community depend on the ebb and flow of aggression and anti-aggression, and there are absolutely no exceptions. The safety of Vietnam and Hong Kong has always depended on China. During the period when China was fighting alone in the international community, engaging in anti-aggression, Vietnam and Hong Kong were already in a precarious situation.

Regarding Vietnam, how France and Japan will negotiate, how they will decide, or even whether they have already reached some kind of agreement? The news is confusing and vague, and cannot be proven until future facts are revealed. Recently, there have also been reports that France's attitude has become tougher, which is actually because Britain has indicated to Japan that it will no longer compromise. Originally, Britain and France, and not just Britain and France, no matter how they get along in other aspects of the international community, have the same attitude in the Far East because of their shared interests. Therefore, France's attitude is influenced by Britain's attitude, which is natural. France's failure in the European war and Britain's compromising attitude on the Tianjin concession problem have both made France soften in the Far East due to its difficult situation. When Britain decided not to give up Hong Kong and Burma, France turned to a more active stance. As far as our perception is concerned, there are likely to be other factors that have made France's attitude tougher. For example, the German-French armistice agreement clearly stipulates that France may retain a part of its navy to defend its colonies. This also reveals Germany's understanding of the Far East, which supports France's position in the Far East. However, confirming that France's attitude is indeed becoming tougher still requires observing what kind of practical measures France has taken in Vietnam. Dealing with aggression requires practicality, which China deeply understands and France must thoroughly understand.

Regarding Hong Kong, according to news from London and Tokyo, Britain has not yet clearly responded to the demands made by Japan on June 26th. In addition, it is reported that Japan has already announced the abandonment of the Anglo-Japanese intelligence agreement signed in November of the year before last, and will implement a complete blockade of China's coastline tomorrow. As a result, Hong Kong will practically become an isolated island and be in imminent danger. The reason for the international community's feeling of tension is also related to this. How Britain will respond to Japan through diplomatic channels is unknown, but its agility and decisiveness have already been seen in its actions. First, it blew up the international bridge at the junction between Kowloon New Territories and Shenzhen, showing its isolation and determination. Second, it formulated a plan to evacuate all its women and children, and the first batch has already set off. Third, it indicated to the Chinese people, who are the most numerous residents, to seek evacuation as soon as possible. Fourth, it notified the United States, which is most concerned, that Hong Kong is in danger and prepared to evacuate American citizens. Fifth, it implemented martial law. It is believed that there must be even more practical measures in addition to these. How it will evolve in the future depends on how Japan acts, but Britain has at least shown Japan in its actions that it will never give up Hong Kong, let alone Burma.

If China had not resisted the war from the beginning, or if it had been completely defeated in the war, or if it had compromised halfway, then Japan would have directly oppressed British and French territories in the Far East, and would have declared the so-called Monroe Doctrine in East Asia without hesitation. Now, in its frustration, Japan has taken this reckless action. Although the almost crazy action cannot be predicted with reason, its momentum is like the end of a strong arrow. It should not be something that Britain and France cannot deal with. It only depends on whether Britain and France have the determination not to withdraw from the Far East and not to hand over their rights and interests. Looking at the overall situation, Germany and Italy also have their economic interests and prospects in the Far East, and they are still unwilling to expand the European war in their dealings with Southeastern Europe. Therefore, they will certainly not allow the anti-communist pact to be revived and used by others in response to the new provocations that have occurred in the Far East. The most comforting and exciting phenomenon, in addition to the above, is that the US fleet secretly left Honolulu a few days ago, causing the world to suspect that it was returning to defend Panama, as if the United States did not have time to take care of the Far East. However, yesterday's telegrams said that the US fleet suddenly returned to Honolulu and that several destroyers had sailed to Manila. This is another powerful response that replaces words!

### Hong Kong Government Prepares for Emergency, British Women and Children Begin Evacuation, American Fleet Sails Back to Hawaii

Hong Kong: A Hong Kong government spokesperson stated that the Hong Kong government is considering a swift evacuation of women and children and is preparing to deal with all emergencies and the possibility of future colonial border wars. There is no danger at present, and we do not anticipate anything happening. However, we have seen how friendly Italy was at first, and then, when the situation became unfavorable for Britain, it brazenly entered the war. Therefore, we must now be fully prepared. We have also seen examples of military personnel in other countries, who, once they gain power, begin to oppose the wishes of their government. Preventing such possible events is also the responsibility of the Hong Kong government. The decision to evacuate women and children is not due to any recent developments. The Hong Kong government has not received any news indicating that the situation is about to become serious. However, the coming months are likely to be a dangerous period for the entire empire, so we should consider every possible development and plan to deal with it responsibly. Regarding preparedness, we must consider future changes and whether this colony is likely to face war or blockade. If Hong Kong is to face war (which no one dares to predict), then women and children should be far away. If the Hong Kong government believes there is reason for alarm, it can issue a notice in a very short time and implement the evacuation of people. We can give people a week to settle their affairs. Although the first batch of evacuees will be sent to Manila, they will only stay there for a short period. Once other locations are arranged, they will be moved elsewhere. The authorities here have found that Chinese residents of Hong Kong do not want to retreat to the mainland. However, the authorities anticipate that if news comes from the mainland reporting that those who have moved there are not suffering any hardship, then the Chinese here may quickly move away, which is not yet known. Of the 1,700 Chinese refugees currently here, only 22 have taken the opportunity to return to the mainland. The authorities estimate that 300 people will move to the mainland tomorrow. (One-Day Associated Press Dispatch)

Manila: Today, the Philippines is awaiting 4,000 refugees fleeing from Hong Kong. The extraordinary movements of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet have sparked speculation among unofficial circles here about the role the United States would play if Japan were to attack Vietnam and Hong Kong. Military circles here believe that Japan is currently massing troops on the border of Hong Kong, but it is said that the heavy floods there have hindered their troops' movements. Some well-informed sources believe that Japan has the greatest possibility of attacking Hong Kong and Vietnam recently. It is rumored that some American warships will be dispatched to Hong Kong to evacuate American refugees. Yesterday, a squadron of American destroyers sailed back to the Philippines from the China Sea. Some of this fleet may be sent to Hong Kong. Yesterday, two squadrons of destroyers returned here from the China Sea, and six large submarines sailed away from the Philippines. According to U.S. naval officials here, this is a "routine transfer," but unofficial sources point out that the Asiatic Fleet usually stays in North China ports during the summer. The U.S. Army is busy preparing refugee camps for refugees coming here from Hong Kong. The Red Cross is also making rapid preparations today. A volunteer committee has been formed in Baguio to prepare to accommodate 500 refugees. The British Consul here stated that he will be responsible for accommodating British refugees from Hong Kong. He is working with the Philippine Red Cross and the U.S. Army. (One-Day Associated Press Dispatch)

Hong Kong: The Hong Kong Electric News reported that the government's decision to evacuate women and children is based on various reasons, one of which is the desire to prepare for all emergencies, and the remote possibility of war is one of them. A spokesperson said, "There is no danger today, and we do not anticipate any danger. We are only taking various precautions to secure our position." The decision to evacuate women and children is not due to any recent developments. The information received by the government does not indicate that the overall situation will deteriorate. However, the coming months will be a dangerous period for the entire empire. We are responsible for considering all possible developments and arranging to deal with them to prepare for a rainy day. (One-Day Reuters Dispatch)

Hong Kong: As many American refugees followed the notice of the U.S. Consul General and rushed to board the American mail ship President Coolidge, 1,900 family members of British Army, Air Force, and Navy personnel also boarded the Japanese Empress ship at 4:30 this afternoon to go to Manila. The President Coolidge is scheduled to set sail at midnight tonight. Both the Japanese Empress and the President Coolidge have added beds in their cabins, making them very crowded. Each cabin has four times as many passengers as usual. British soldiers saw their families off to the ship and did not leave until an hour later. These people who boarded the ship were experiencing the taste of war for the first time. Their food was also soldier-style, with only potato soup, bread, butter, and water. Although crowded together, everyone had a smile on their face and showed no worry. According to a senior British military officer, this group of people leaving is lucky. The second group to leave will be larger, with 4,000 people, and will be even more crowded. The Hong Kong Telegraph reported that to strengthen air defense, another 100 people engaged in air defense will be recalled tomorrow. At the same time, the U.S. Consul General also announced that the U.S. ships Asheville and Tulsa will remain here, but if the situation becomes urgent, these two ships will be used to carry American people. Also, the U.S. ship Norfolk City will arrive here on July 4, and the President Taft will arrive on July 8. These two ships will also be used to carry American refugees. (One-Day Associated Press Special Correspondent Carter Dispatch)

Hong Kong: Today, the first batch of 600 women and children began to evacuate. It is expected that a large number of women and children will leave here on British and other ships on Friday. A Chang Hing Company mail ship carried military dependents away from here at 4:30 this afternoon. This evacuation is compulsory. (The government has solemnly stated that, except for those serving in various important agencies, there will be no exceptions. If any women and children do not register now, they will be evacuated in uncomfortable conditions after Friday.) The Dutch and Norwegian consulates have notified their nationals to prepare for evacuation. The French consulate said it would follow the Hong Kong government's advice. The American mail ship President Coolidge is currently staying here until midnight today to evacuate American nationals who voluntarily leave. Although the U.S. is not forcing the evacuation of its nationals, its consular authorities have advised those who do not need to stay in Hong Kong to leave. Other American ships are expected to arrive here around July 4 and 8. If necessary, they will be used for evacuation. (One-Day Reuters Dispatch)

Hong Kong: The President Coolidge returned to Hong Kong on June 30. It is reported that the U.S. Consulate General received instructions from Washington to advise American nationals to evacuate voluntarily, but not to order them to leave Hong Kong under duress. Unless there are special circumstances, the President Coolidge is allowed to depart for the Philippines at midnight on the 1st. American ships will still arrive in Hong Kong on the 4th and 8th. If necessary, they can be kept ready to evacuate American nationals. Two American ships are also staying in Hong Kong on standby. British nationals are all prepared to leave. The border is quiet, and the market is stable. (One-Day Telegraph)

Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government today notified the U.S. Consul General, stating that although there have been no changes in the situation here, there is a possibility of it "becoming more tense." After receiving the Hong Kong government's warning, the U.S. Consul General has notified the American ship President Coolidge to stay here at least until midnight to facilitate the transfer of American nationals who wish to leave Hong Kong. As of now, American nationals have not received a notice urging them to leave Hong Kong, but the U.S. Consulate has notified its nationals of the serious situation. (One-Day Associated Press Urgent Dispatch)

Honolulu: The American fleet that "disappeared" earlier last week suddenly sailed back to the Hawaiian Islands this morning. The sudden deterioration of the Far East situation is a possible factor in the American fleet's return to Hawaii. However, naval officials claim that the American fleet is only conducting "routine training." At 8:00 this morning, the advance team of the fleet, consisting of 40 warships, was seen sailing into the harbor. Unofficial sources believe that the American fleet's sudden return to Hawaii was due to a temporary change in the Navy Department's plans. It is generally recalled that senior naval officials stated last week that the American fleet was sailing to the Panama Canal. Admiral Lee Richardson, Commander-in-Chief of the American Fleet, issued a statement yesterday saying, "Most of the American Fleet left Hawaii last Monday for a routine exercise simulating war. It was not notified in advance. This exercise has been held before and is a major part of training and can be held at any time. Radio silence is maintained during the exercise." (One-Day Associated Press Dispatch)

Washington: The sudden reappearance of the American fleet in Hawaii yesterday has sparked speculation here last night. However, there has been no official criticism yet. The mystery of the American fleet's whereabouts was cleared up as President Roosevelt and State Department officials studied Japan's announced "Monroe Doctrine" for East Asia. (One-Day Associated Press Dispatch)

Newspaper Advocates Taking Strong Action Against Britain

Tokyo: This morning, the Asahi Shimbun advocated taking strong action against Britain. It is said that Britain has adopted an opposing attitude towards Japan. The Japanese government has requested the British government not to transport military supplies to General Chiang Kai-shek and not to allow such military supplies to pass through Burma. It has not yet received a response from Britain. Britain seems to be waiting and watching and will follow the decisions of the United States. (One-Day Associated Press Dispatch)

London: According to unconfirmed reports, the United States has received a secret warning that Germany is planning to immediately conclude an alliance with Japan to allow Japan to act freely in the Far East. It is also said that Japan may prevent the transport of military supplies to Britain in the Far East. This alliance, it is said, guarantees Japan complete control of the Pacific Ocean, including the annexation of the Dutch East Indies, French Vietnam, Australia, the Canadian province of Vancouver, Burma, the Malay Federation, and Singapore. (One-Day Associated Press Dispatch)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro recently told the press that the Japanese government cannot understand the evacuation of foreigners from Hong Kong. The Japanese government, while protesting the transport of military supplies through Burma to Chongqing, has not demanded the evacuation of the people of Hong Kong. "We have indeed adopted a certain plan for the Burma Road issue, but we must wait for Britain's response before implementing these plans." The spokesman did not indicate the nature of the plan that Japan has adopted for the Burma Road. Suma also said that the Japanese side has not yet received a response to its request that Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in Shanghai. (One-Day Associated Press Dispatch)

Tokyo: Today, when the Foreign Ministry spokesman received reporters, someone asked whether some army officers were dissatisfied with Foreign Minister Arita's speech on Saturday. The answer was that although there are various rumors circulating outside, Foreign Minister Arita's speech was reviewed by the ministers of relevant provinces before it was delivered. Someone also asked whether Japan's "New Order" policy includes Vietnam. The spokesman replied that the Nanyang region is also included. The Dutch East Indies and Vietnam are both parts of East Asia, but he refused to list the countries that Japan's "New Order" policy will implement. The spokesman admitted that this policy will extend south, beyond Tian Dao. The spokesman also denied that there was a contradiction between the Foreign Minister's statement on April 15 to maintain the status quo of the Dutch East Indies and his speech on Saturday. It is said that the statement on April 15 was "specific and realistic," while the speech on Saturday was "psychological and philosophical." (One-Day Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" here, representatives of the Japanese Army and Navy now deny that the Japanese military is taking a reserved attitude towards the current urgent diplomatic issues. It is said that after the Army and Navy authorities met at the Ministry of the Army the day before yesterday, they continued to hold meetings yesterday, unanimously resolving that the Japanese military opposes any attitude that prevents Japan from establishing a new order in the Far East. "It is as firm as iron." Attendees at the meeting included some veterans, such as former Army Minister Araki and General Hayashi. Japanese Navy representatives solemnly denied rumors about the Japanese Navy's decision to avoid conflict with Britain and the United States under any circumstances, stating that if Britain and the United States continue to interfere in Japan's Far East policy, such conflict will be unavoidable. (One-Day Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

London: The Times published an article today entitled "Japan and the Pacific," commenting on Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's speech on Saturday, stating that the main feature of this speech is the announcement of a Monroe Doctrine that includes most of the Far East and the South Pacific. Tokyo is clearly taking full advantage of the British government's busy schedule and lack of time to attend to other matters. This is an inevitable development after France's failure and should not be surprising. Arita included the South Seas in East Asia and did not attempt to limit this vast region, but it may include everything from Java to Tahiti. Its significance is very important, and Arita did not explain the developments that seem to have been anticipated. Until this matter becomes clearer, it is difficult to estimate the importance of this declaration. If its meaning is to regard the vast regions of the Pacific and the Far East as Japan's sphere of influence and other powers must maintain their legitimate positions within it, then countries that hold definite rights in those two parts of the world may not accept this demand. If not, if the meaning of this declaration is only to hope that future consultations with Japan will be held on any territorial or political changes in the Pacific, then at a time when the foundations and boundaries of most of this world are being shaken or destroyed by lawless violence, this request is reasonable.

### A Large Number of Students Arrested in Beiping

Beiping: More than 70 Chinese professors and students here have been arrested and interrogated by Japanese and Italian soldiers in the past 10 days. The reason is that the school authorities are trying to send newly graduated young people to free China. This time is the end of the spring semester of Yenching University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Peking University. Yenching University and Fu Jen Catholic University are both run by Americans. Two Chinese teachers from these two schools have been arrested by the Japanese army. One was released after a few days, and the other was severely beaten during interrogation. According to foreign sources, the Japanese army's arrest of students is part of a Japanese army authorities' attempt to intimidate some Chinese whom the Japanese side considers to be intending to persuade a majority of students to meet the educational level of Chongqing. However, none of the special commissioners of the Chongqing government have been arrested by the Japanese army. It is reported that two middle school teachers are the special commissioners of Beiping who are engaged in organizing groups to support the National Government. (One-Day Reuters Dispatch)

Romanians of Jewish ethnicity fleeing into Bessarabia have been stopped near the border. German minorities in the provinces occupied by the Red Army are continuously fleeing, coinciding with the Jews. It is reported that communists released from prison by the Red Army are now seeking revenge on those who persecuted them in the past. Vehicles loaded with wheat and sugar have been seized by communist committees. Although the Soviet Union denies that its demands involve Black Sea ports, residents of Constanța are fleeing en masse to the hinterland. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

Haitong News Agency has received detailed information directly from the town, as follows: "Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a large-scale communist demonstration was held on Strada Traian in Galați, Romania. The ten leaders were executed by firing squad. In the afternoon, 2,000 people arrived at the train station, 90% of whom were Jews, wanting to go to Bessarabia to obtain Soviet citizenship. Romanian troops surrounded them, whereupon one Jew pulled out a pistol and killed a Romanian soldier. The Romanian army then sounded the horn and summoned a large contingent of ground troops, who opened fire with machine guns, resulting in 500 to 600 people killed on the spot. Last night, cavalry patrolled the streets, searching for scattered Jews. Anyone suspected was arrested. Galați is an important port on the Danube River with a population of 100,000, of which a large number are Jews." (Haitong dispatch, 1st)

German Foreign Ministry Statement

Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry stated that the news that Germany will assist Romania after the end of the war in Western Europe is not true.

German-Italian Balkan Policy

Rome: Last night, authoritative sources here stated that the crisis in the Balkans, which became tense last week due to the Soviet Union's demands on Romania, may now remain calm, allowing the Axis powers to proceed with their military plans to invade Britain. However, the authoritative sources also stated that the Axis governments have not given any formal guarantees to Romania to avoid other countries making territorial demands on Romania. The claim that the German and Italian governments have already given guarantees to Romania is an exaggeration. It is reported that Italy most wants to maintain peace among the Balkan countries. It is believed that if Germany and Italy are determined to maintain peace in the Balkans, they will use their influence to suppress the countries concerned in the Balkans. However, since no country seeking anything in the Balkans is being sanctioned at this time, maintaining peace in the Balkans is particularly important now. This is because Germany and Italy need to devote all their efforts to attacking Britain. Since Germany and Italy are focusing their efforts on Britain, they cannot also take care of Southeastern Europe, thereby dispersing their forces. Furthermore, informed sources in Rome believe that if Germany and Italy launched a war in the Balkans at the same time as invading Britain, they might not fail immediately, but it would reduce their strength and speed in dealing with Britain. As for the Soviet Union's move to deliver an ultimatum to Romania at this time, not sooner or later, most observers in Romania believe that this action by the Soviet Union was expected by Germany and Italy and is not surprising. Informed sources stated that Mussolini and Hitler may have deliberately allowed the Soviet Union to satisfy its territorial demands in the Balkans in order to prepare for events in Western Europe, so that a larger crisis would not occur in the Balkans when attacking Britain, which would impede Romania's supply of gasoline and other raw materials to Germany. If the Soviet Union's demands are not resolved, the crisis in Rome will certainly arise, and Romanian-German transport will certainly be paralyzed. (United Press dispatch, 1st)

### Chamberlain's Radio Address: Expressing Determination to Resist, Britain's Naval and Air Power Strong, German Troops Face Difficulty Crossing the Sea

London – Privy Councilor Chamberlain stated in a broadcast last night that all members of the British War Cabinet are working together harmoniously on all matters. Anyone who credulously believes the German propaganda that our opinions differ, or who imagines that we are willing to negotiate peace with the enemy, is playing into the hands of the Nazi's cunning schemes. In reality, we remain a united nation with a strong will, preferring destruction to being dominated by the Nazis. Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, we wish to attack the enemy and resist their attacks on us with the fighting spirit and determination worthy of a great nation. Although we are now fighting alone for freedom and civilization, the brave men and women of our country all know that we must rely on ourselves, under God's protection, to achieve victory, as we have done before. I do not underestimate the enemy's forces that defeated the French army and destroyed France. We all know that the enemy is now unconstrained and can concentrate on attacking our country. The air raids we have recently experienced are undoubtedly just a prelude to more severe events, as the enemy is now putting all its efforts into a swift and decisive victory. The enemy is now making preparations for their attack on our country and will attempt to invade by sea and air at any moment. However, there is a formidable obstacle between the enemy and us, which the enemy has not yet encountered, namely, the sea. Our navy is unmatched by the enemy. The enemy must first drive away our warships before their invading troops can land on our coast. Even if the enemy troops do manage to land, the various supplies needed by a modern army to cope with a strong enemy still need to be transported mostly by sea. Our air force today is larger in number than at the beginning of the war, and its equipment, training, and morale are stronger than the enemy's air force. The enemy must first destroy or drive away our air force before it can safely land from the sea and air. Currently, our troops stationed in the country are more numerous than at any time. Most of our army is made up of well-trained men who have not only fought the enemy on the battlefield but also believe themselves to be superior to the enemy. Their numbers, preparations, and deployment are also increasing daily. Finally, I must mention that countless men and women elsewhere are now doing their best to supply us with weapons and food, or are contributing to civil defense. They are all motivated by an unwavering fighting spirit. If the enemy does invade our country, we will fight them in the air, at sea, or on the beaches with all the weapons we have. Even if the enemy breaks through on any front, we will fight to the death in every street, every village, and every house, until either the enemy or we are completely destroyed. If the enemy troops are driven back and retreat, as our troops did from France, there will be no friendly fleet at sea to await them. On the beaches of Britain, the retreating German troops will be greeted by nothing but death. I have now explained in detail the reasons why we can repel the enemy's attack, but we have an even stronger point, namely, we are fighting for our homes and families, and we know that what we are fighting for is humanity, peace, and justice, and we will certainly receive God's protection. Anyone who has the slightest doubt about our victory is truly weak-willed. (Reuter's dispatch from the 1st)

### Mystery of the Death of Italian Air Force General Balbo, Rumors of Disagreement with the Italian Prime Minister, Göring Sends Telegram of Condolences to the Italian Prime Minister

London – The British Foreign Intelligence Office stated that after careful investigation of the crash of General Balbo's plane, it was confirmed that it was not related to the British Air Force. The rumor that General Erbo had died in battle was not true. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini previously appointed Balbo as the Governor of Libya because Balbo's presence in Italy was inconvenient for him. Since then, Erbo has often opposed Italy's pro-war policy and obedience to Hitler. His death in a plane crash remains a mystery. Similar incidents have happened before, such as the death of General Fritz, who opposed Hitler's domestic and foreign policies, in Warsaw. German wireless also linked these two events, saying that Balbo's death was in the same spirit as Fritz's death. The truth of Balbo's death may never be known to the world. What is certain is that Erbo did not die in the war against the British Air Force. (Reuter's dispatch from the 1st)

Rome – According to reports today regarding the details of the death of Air Force General Balbo, he was flying back to the Tobruk airport with several officials when a group of British bombers appeared just as they were about to land. Balbo immediately joined the battle, but unfortunately, his plane was hit and caught fire, leading to his death in service to the country. (Haitong dispatch from the 1st)

Berlin – German Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Göring sent a telegram to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday to express his condolences on the death of Italian Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Balbo. The original telegram reads: "I was shocked to hear the news of General Balbo's death and am deeply saddened. Heaven is unkind, a good general has fallen, and I am filled with regret. However, Balbo's heroic spirit is sufficient to guarantee Italy's victory. On behalf of the German Air Force, I extend my condolences to Your Excellency the Prime Minister. I hope you will accept my heartfelt feelings. Göring." (Haitong dispatch from the 1st)

American citizens in this city with families in Hong Kong feel uneasy and have been asking the American Consulate for information. The consulate staff replied that although the situation in Hong Kong is tense, there is currently no major problem. The American citizens have not yet evacuated, but they are planning to do so in case of emergency. American citizens residing in the French Concession in this city have also inquired about the safety of the area. The response was that the situation in the area is difficult to say for sure. According to reporters, the managers of American trading firms in this city who have families in Hong Kong have all telegraphed them to evacuate, either to Manila or to Shanghai, to avoid future difficulties. This shows how serious the situation in Hong Kong is.

Britain and the United States Stand on the Same Front

According to foreign sources, Dr. Bedou, a member of the Hong Kong Rotary Club who recently returned from the United States, declared at the Hong Kong Rotary Club on the 26th of last month that Americans are now 100% willing to help the British fight for freedom. During his twelve months in the United States, he had two hundred and fifty conversations with Americans about the Far East issue. He said, "You may be very interested in the opinions of Americans, and I would like to tell you that Americans are 100% willing to help the British in distress. After traveling across the country and talking with many Americans, I can say with certainty that as the world situation continues to develop, Americans will stand on the same front as the British."

Japanese Spokesman Claims Ignorance

At a press conference last night, a Japanese military spokesman claimed that the Japanese military authorities were completely unaware of the concentration of troops around Hong Kong. He said that the Japanese residents in Hong Kong were not evacuating, and the Japanese authorities did not believe it was necessary to order them to evacuate. Japanese ships continue to operate on the Hong Kong route as usual. The spokesman said that he did not attach importance to the British order for women and children in Hong Kong to evacuate to Manila.

Japan's Final Test of Hong Kong

The world is watching Japan's carefully planned invasion of Hong Kong and Vietnam. Yesterday's Continental Daily News called it a new crisis in the Far East and commented that everyone concerned about the recent situation in China attaches great importance to the status of Hong Kong. Since the British authorities issued the order to evacuate women and children, there must be a state of panic in Hong Kong. The only explanation for the purpose of this order is that Britain is determined to defend Hong Kong and fight the Japanese. However, judging from the usual British stance, this may not be entirely the case. Although the tension in Hong Kong is due to Japanese provocation, the British consider it more important to defend their homeland than their possessions along the coast of China and are unwilling to fight Japan. Japan's intention is to take advantage of this weakness of the British, use empty threats, and try to extricate itself from the quagmire of its disastrous three-year invasion of China. We already know that Japan's war in China has reached

a dead end. Its diplomatic position is also isolated. Japan is unable to end the war or to cope with its depleted domestic funds. The people are weary of the invasion of China. The Japanese military authorities have no choice but to engage in a final test, challenging third countries to divert the attention of their people and to cover up their defeats in China. Japan has the victory in the Russo-Japanese War in its history, so this time, the Japanese want to use their wits to attack Britain's

Far Eastern possessions. The Japanese anticipate that the United States may not intervene in the current presidential election. The Japanese have recently claimed that all actions of the Japanese military are intended to block China's foreign communication lines. But in fact, Japan has repeatedly assured third countries of their rights in China, and this blockade cannot be justified. China currently has only two "open" ports, Ningbo and Wenzhou, and the Japanese

know everything about the people entering and leaving these two places. Therefore, it is credible that the Hong Kong authorities claim that the route from Hong Kong to Free China is not important and has no military connection with China. The above is not intended to be alarmist. Judging from the facts, it is indeed a reasonable conclusion. When the Japanese military started operations from Guangzhou, the British were in a very serious position. At that time, although temporary measures were prepared in Manila to accommodate refugees from Hong Kong if necessary, the Hong Kong authorities did not show any anxiety. Although internal

preparations had been completed, there were no preparations for the evacuation of women and children. It was not until the declaration of a special emergency order that we knew that the Hong Kong military authorities had already made up their minds and understood where their responsibilities lay. How will the British, American, and French policies be implemented in Shanghai? The residents of this city should pay close attention to whether the countries will agree to the Japanese occupation without opposition, as Japan has proposed the withdrawal of troops from Shanghai by all countries (except Japan). This must be the focus of concern for thousands of people. If the British, American, and French people are so concerned about the happiness of their families and move them from South China and Vietnam to safer areas, then we in Shanghai should also enjoy the same treatment."

### 7/7 Anniversary

Promote the Winter Clothing Movement

The third anniversary of the 7/7 Incident is approaching in an instant. Although all sectors of Shanghai do not intend to hold a commemorative ceremony due to the special environment, the people of Shanghai are determined to save the country. At that time, they will unanimously promote the movement of recruiting winter clothing to provide soldiers and refugees with winter clothing. The winter clothing funds for this year will still be promoted separately by various industries according to the past methods, and will be handed over to the National Bank for transfer to the Recruiting Association for distribution. It is expected that the promotion situation will be very enthusiastic.

### The Opening of Wusong is Not True

The Japanese military authorities in this city said yesterday morning that the news of the opening of Wusong, allowing people to enter and exit, was not true. According to the news obtained last Saturday, the ban on vehicles and pedestrians in Wusong had been lifted, but those who went to Wusong were blocked by Japanese guards at the old site of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. The Japanese military authorities said again yesterday that if you want to go to Wusongdong, you must be accompanied by a Japanese military officer or obtain a "pass" from the Japanese military.

### The Situation in the Shanghai Concessions Can Definitely Maintain the Status Quo, British Ambassador Jiang Remains in Shanghai to Pay Attention to Everything, The French Concession is in Talks with the Japanese Side

According to reliable sources in diplomatic circles, since the British and French ambassadors arrived in Shanghai, they originally planned to go to Beidaihe in North China for their annual summer vacation. Due to the increasingly tense situation in the Far East, the British and French ambassadors, although the weather has been hot, have no intention of leaving Shanghai to go north in the near future, and the work of the two ambassadors has suddenly become busy. If the tense situation in the Far East does not ease, it is unknown whether the summer vacation plan for this year will be cancelled. When the reporter of Pingming News Agency visited a foreign diplomatic official yesterday to inquire about the recent situation in the Far East, they did not want to express their opinions, but they also admitted that the severity of the situation in the Far East is increasing day by day. When asked about the Shanghai concession issue, they said that the status of the Public Concession can still maintain the status quo at present, and there will be no major changes.

Agreement Principles are the Same for Both Concessions

The English-language Da Mei Evening News said that it has been learned that the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai and the French Concession authorities are continuing to hold "cooperative talks" on issues related to the French Concession. Reliable sources said that these talks are a supplement to the agreement reached by the French and Japanese authorities last week. According to the details of the agreement announced today (1st), the details of the agreement reached last week are the same as the understanding reached by the Public Concession authorities and the Japanese military last year on the matter of detaining political prisoners.

Japanese Military Vehicles Drive Directly into the Chinese Territory

In the future, people arrested in the French Concession for political reasons or suspected of being connected with political groups will be handed over to the Japanese military authorities for detention. Another point that has been clearly agreed upon is that Japanese military vehicles can enter the Chinese territory of Nanshi and Pillion through the Public Concession and the French Concession. It has been learned that the French and Japanese authorities had previously reached an understanding that only Japanese military vehicles on the Bund of the French Concession were allowed to enter the Chinese territory from the French Concession, and the military vehicles had to wait at the junction of the Bund of the French Concession for French police escort to pass through. It is heard that according to the new agreement, this restriction will be cancelled, but Japanese military vehicles are still subject to the restriction that they cannot travel on the central roads of the French Concession.

French and Japanese Sides Meet from Time to Time

As for other details, it is not yet known for sure, because both the French and Japanese authorities refuse to disclose them. However, it is heard that the talks between the two sides are still in progress, "to improve the relationship between the French and Japanese authorities in this city." According to Japanese sources, the French and Japanese authorities meet from time to time to cope with the new situation, and aim to exchange views on the situation in this city. Most of the details have been stipulated in the agreement reached last week. The cooperative talks currently underway are aimed at promoting relations in this city.

The French Consulate Official's Expression

An official of the French Consulate did not want to make any comments on last week's agreement, but said that the understanding between the French and Japanese authorities has made smooth progress, which can be seen from the attitude of returning the Xujiahui Military Zone, and the transfer of the area is being carried out very peacefully, without any disturbances.

### Taikoo and Jardine's Ships Sail to Haiphong on Schedule, Routes to Hong Kong and the Gulf Remain Unchanged, Chinne Canada Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong

The situation in Hong Kong is tense, and there are also news that American citizens have been ordered to leave Hong Kong. As for the Shanghai-Hong Kong route, it remains open as usual. The Taikoo Company's Sichuan ship can arrive in Shanghai today, and Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng ship will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Taikoo's Taiyuan and Suiyang ships departed from Hong Kong for Shanghai yesterday.

The scheduled voyages from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Fang are: Taiyuan ship will go to Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and Haiphong this week. The Sichuan ship will go directly to Hong Kong, and it is not yet certain whether Xiamen will stop by the Gulf. The Suiyang ship is also scheduled to leave this week, going to Hong Kong and Singapore. Jardine Matheson's Taisheng ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Haiphong on the 4th, also stopping at Hong Kong. The non-scheduled freighter Wah Lun Company's Grant is scheduled to go directly to Hong Kong on the 4th, loading passengers and cargo as usual. Although transportation between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Fang is uninterrupted, passengers have been waiting and watching, so cargo transportation has plummeted.

Asia Queen, Changxing Company's Asia Queen mail ship, arrived in Shanghai from Canada via Honolulu, Yokohama, Kobe, and Nagasaki at 11:30 last night, and docked at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Pier. The passengers were unable to disembark last night because the ship docked late at night. They will disembark at the Xin'guan Pier at 8:45 this morning on a small boat prepared by the company. The ship will not stay in Shanghai for long and is scheduled to leave anchorage this evening for Hong Kong and Little Luzon. The small boats for sending passengers have not been decided and will depart from the Xin'guan Pier at 4:30 in the afternoon.

Little Luzon, Java Shipping Company's Chinne Canada, arrived in Shanghai at around 10:00 yesterday morning and docked at the Puxi Lan Yanchou Pier. The ship had as many as 798 passengers this time. It is said that most of them came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. They took a small boat prepared by the company to the Xin'guan Pier at noon yesterday to disembark. The ship will stay in Shanghai for three days and is scheduled to return to Surabaya via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Little Luzon on the 4th.

American Ships Delayed, The American President Line's President Coolidge mail ship, which came to Shanghai from the United States to Hong Kong Little Luzon on the 27th of last month, was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Little Luzon on Tuesday (9th) next week to return to the United States. According to the company's news yesterday, due to the tense situation in Hong Kong, the ship was ordered to transport American citizens from Hong Kong to Little Luzon, so the return from Little Luzon will be delayed by three to five days. The definite date cannot be scheduled yet.

Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation, According to news from the transportation industry, since the situation in Yunnan and Vietnam is tense, there is a risk that the route from Shanghai through South China may be blocked at any time. The China Travel Service in this city has realized this and is planning to handle the transportation of Ningbo money. It is currently in the planning stage. According to recent reports, staff have been sent to Ningbo to inspect the transportation routes, such as from Ningbo to Jinhua, Yingtan, Jian, and Jiehualong and other places, directly to Liuzhou. After the inspection is completed and a detailed report is submitted, the plan will be implemented.

### Curb Rent Increases

Donations Have Been Implemented, But They Should Not Be Used As An Excuse

The authorities of both concessions have implemented donations. Now all parties are concerned about the possible consequences that may arise after the donations are implemented. The first is the rent issue. Concession rents can be said to have reached their peak today. Not only are there no empty houses for landlords, but rents have also increased in recent years. The excessive profits of second landlords are also undeniable. The two concessions have implemented donations this time. The first landlords pay land taxes, and the second landlords also pay house donations. If the first landlords can pass on the donations to the second landlords, then the second landlords, in addition to bearing the increased house donations, will also bear the landlords' land taxes, and will inevitably ask the third tenants for more. Moreover, if the landlord increases the rent, the house donation will also increase, which is bound to happen. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired from various public groups yesterday, and all public groups hoped that the landlords would have a broad vision and not use the slight increase in land tax this time as an excuse to propose a rent increase. The second landlords should be content with the gift of wartime and stop making unreasonable demands on the third tenants, so that we can get through the difficulties together. It is also learned that in order to prevent rent increase disputes, the authorities of both concessions will strictly curb unreasonable rent increase actions. The British China Motor Bus Company has specially issued a new red two-cent value coupon to facilitate passengers to find another starting point. It will be circulated on all buses from today until December 31 of this year.

### Pacific Affairs Magazine Publishes Shanghai Special Issue

Frank Hyland, the managing editor of the Pacific Affairs magazine hosted by the Pacific Affairs Alliance, is currently in Shanghai collecting materials to publish a "Shanghai Special Issue" of the magazine in the near future. He recently sent a letter to the American Chamber of Commerce, soliciting artwork from American residents in Shanghai who are interested in art, for the covers of the July to September issues of the magazine.

The deadline for submitting designs to the American Chamber of Commerce was yesterday at noon, and it is said that there were many applicants. The selection process is currently underway.

### President of Da Guang News Agency, Shao Xubai, Assassinated; Fatally Shot in Ambush Returning Home Last Night

An assassination occurred at approximately 7 PM yesterday in the Mingde Lane on Foch Road. Three thugs ambushed a person riding in a chartered car. The victim was Shao Xubai, the assistant manager of the Ning Shao Fire and Water Insurance Company at 86 Ningbo Road and the president of the Da Guang News Agency. He was shot four times and died shortly thereafter. Details are as follows:

Engaged in Business After the War

Shao Xubai was 32 years old, from Ningbo, and resided at 10 Mingde Lane on Foch Road. Before the war, he was involved in labor union affairs. After the "August 13th Incident," he devoted himself to business and journalism, serving as the assistant manager of the Ning Shao Fire and Water Insurance Company, the deputy manager of the Victory Soda Factory, and the president of the Da Guang News Agency. He used chartered car number 1004 for transportation, driven by Ah Er (age 32) from Haimen. At approximately 7 PM last night, Shao was returning home from the Ning Shao Fire and Water Insurance Company.

Ambushed on Return

As the car approached the back entrance of 7 Mingde Lane, three thugs suddenly appeared. Two were wearing black shirts, and one was wearing a grey tweed suit. They were waiting at the lane entrance. The person in the suit held a gun, watching the gatekeeper Zhou Ziqing (age 35, from Funing) at number 993, preventing him from making noise. Shortly after, they saw Shao's car approaching. The two thugs in long shirts immediately drew their guns and opened fire without hesitation, firing four shots, all of which hit their target. Three shots hit his abdomen, and one hit his right leg. He immediately bled profusely and collapsed to the ground. At this moment, the gatekeeper who was being watched heard the gunfire and tried to resist.

Fatally Wounded

The thug in the suit, in order to preemptively strike, quickly fired a shot, hitting the gatekeeper's right hand. Afterwards, Shao was taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The thugs, seeing that their objective had been achieved, scattered and fled west on motorcycles. Shao's wife and others, hearing the commotion, rushed out and saw Shao rolling on the ground, bleeding profusely. However, he was still conscious, so they quickly called an ambulance to rush him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Doctors managed to extract the bullets, and his condition seemed to improve. However, after a while, his condition suddenly deteriorated, his consciousness became blurred, and he died at approximately 9 PM. His body was moved to the autopsy room at the Delastre Road small hospital to await an examination by the Special Number Two Court this morning, after which funeral arrangements will be made.

Widespread Condolences

Shao was wearing a grey silk shirt, white silk trousers, and white leather shoes. He is survived by his wife, Zheng, age 33, and four children. His son, Fengshan, is just one year old, and the rest are daughters. Shao was a young talent, and his unfortunate death has been met with widespread condolences.

### Continued Implementation of Rice Price Stabilization; Yu Qiaqing Comments on Rice Prices

The Rice Price Stabilization Committee has made several resolutions. In addition to the 15,000+ bags of broken rice from the previous sale, the 20,000 bags of foreign rice ordered recently will arrive in Shanghai soon. Once they arrive, sales can begin immediately within the month. Furthermore, the committee has resolved to order an additional 40,000 bags, which is also in progress. However, the economy is the mother of all things, and the losses from rice price stabilization depend on donations. The more donations, the greater the effect. Therefore, we hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to contribute generously so that we can accomplish this great feat together and fulfill our humanitarian duty. Also, the black market exchange rate is currently rising, and foreign rice ordered from overseas, based on the current exchange rate, costs 64-65 yuan per bag of No. 2 Siamese rice, or 52-53 yuan per picul. If the foreign exchange rate continues to rise, it will be even cheaper. Therefore, we hope that major factories and businesses in the city will continue to purchase rice in groups, as it is cheaper than the current prices in the city, and at the same time, it can replenish the city's reserves, saving oneself is also saving others. I hope everyone will understand this. The future of the city's food supply is deeply dependent on this. Finally, I hope that members of the press will widely publicize this matter so that it can be widely known. The Rice Price Stabilization Committee has also decided to hold a meeting at its office at 4 PM today (Daylight Saving Time) to discuss progress.

Promoting Evaluation

On the 29th of this month, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association, together with the Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association, held a temporary joint meeting. Following the instructions of the Public Works Department, they decided to organize an evaluation committee consisting of various rice industry groups involved in buying, selling, and brokerage, and to invite responsible personnel appointed by the authorities of the two concessions. Once approval is obtained from the concession authorities, the organization and implementation will proceed. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, the association sent committee members Zhu Youzhang, Yan Xiaoquan, and Cao Xengeng to visit the authorities again to report on the progress of the industry's consultations. Deputy Director He personally received them. It is reported that he expressed strong support for the organization of the Shanghai Grain Evaluation Committee and instructed them to expedite the process for its early establishment, while also offering assistance.

Yu's Remarks

Yu Qiaqing made the following remarks: "Recently, rice prices in Shanghai, whether domestic or foreign, have been soaring. Domestic rice has reached 73-74 yuan per picul, and foreign rice has reached 65-66 yuan per picul, setting a new record for the highest rice prices in Shanghai. Looking at the recent price index in Shanghai, due to the rise in the black market exchange rate, actual sales have decreased, and prices have generally fallen compared to before. However, the rice market has risen instead.

The reasons for this are likely to be: (1) the current drought, which raises concerns about the impact on the harvest, (2) rice shortages in the interior, (3) Hong Kong's ban on rice exports, (4) the cessation of exports from Saigon, and (5) the changes in the European war, which may affect rice-producing areas in Southeast Asia. As a result, people are unusually panicked, and speculators are taking the opportunity to hoard and profiteer, disregarding the public's livelihood and social stability. Their intentions are truly questionable. Regarding the five concerns mentioned above, the recent continuous rains should be beneficial to the crops. Panic in the interior is due to Shanghai's transshipment obstruction, which is not fundamentally affected. Shipments from Siam and other places are proceeding as usual. Hong Kong is not a rice-producing area and only stores goods for transshipment. The rice that has been bought and stored can still be shipped, so there is no

Serious state of affairs affecting the overall situation of transportation. The cost of previously stored rice is only about 40+ yuan per picul, and the cost of Siamese rice in transit is only about 57-58 yuan per bag, or about 46-47 yuan per picul. The profits are too high, and the poor suffer even more. It is heartbreaking to see that salaried workers with a family of five need one picul of rice per month, meaning that even officials with an income of 1-200 yuan are finding it difficult to make ends meet, let alone those with salaries of 40-50 yuan, who are unable to survive. Therefore, I hope that members of the rice industry will do their best to stabilize the market situation and prevent speculation. People from outside the industry should prioritize the fact that rice is essential to people's livelihoods and should not seek excessive profits."

### Rotary Club Regular Meeting Tomorrow Noon

The Shanghai Rotary Club's regular meeting this week is scheduled for 12:15 PM on Wednesday, July 3rd, at the first floor of the Capital Hotel on Jiangxi Road. Mr. Milton J. Helmick, the American Judge of the United States Court for China, will speak on "The Difficulties of a Judge." Members from other cities are welcome to attend.

### Water and Electricity Supply to Xujiahui Refugee Area Suspended

The water and electricity supply to the Xujiahui refugee area, which had been provided by the French Concession's French-owned water and electricity company after the Shanghai War, has reportedly been discontinued since the French defense forces and police personnel withdrew from the area. The French-owned water and electricity company is also unwilling to continue supplying water and electricity. Therefore, starting this month, the supply is entrusted to the "Huazhong Water and Electricity Company" by the Japanese side. Several workers from the "Company" were sent to the area a few days ago to install and manage the supply.

### Deputy Manager of Shanghai Central Bank Kidnapped; Another Mr. Cao Also Missing

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that Peter Yu (transliteration), deputy manager of the Shanghai Central Bank, and a Mr. Cao (transliteration), who is widely believed to be a relative of Finance Minister Kong, were reportedly kidnapped last week. Mr. Yu was kidnapped on Yu Garden Road on Saturday morning, while Mr. Cao disappeared after leaving his residence in the French Concession on Saturday afternoon. Their current whereabouts are unknown. The police departments of both concessions have not provided information on these crimes. It is rumored that Mr. Yu holds the keys to important vaults at the Shanghai Central Bank. Until recently, Mr. Yu still resided in the French Concession and only recently moved to a new residence on Yu Garden Road. The number of kidnappers and other details are unknown because Mr. Yu's family does not wish to publicize the matter.

### French Police Crack Kidnapping Case; Hostage Rescued in Hongkou

A businessman surnamed Jia who operates a coal business at No. 4, Lane 156, Jiezier Road, French Concession, was kidnapped by force three days ago. Yesterday, a letter was sent to his family demanding a ransom. The family secretly reported this to the French police, who dispatched detectives to a certain hotel and cracked the kidnapping ring on the spot, arresting several criminals. It is reported that the hostage was hidden in Hongkou and was also rescued.

### Electric Fan Falls, Killing Newspaper Vendor; Catholic Church Provides Compensation

Zhou Longsheng, a native of Pudong residing at No. 5844, Tengfeng Lane, Sichuan Road, was 43 years old. He was a Catholic and worked as a newspaper vendor for the "Dalu Newspaper" and sold sundries on British and American warships docked in the Huangpu River. On Sunday, June 30th, Zhou went to Mass at the Catholic Church outside Xinbei Gate at 10:00 AM. While kneeling and praying, an oscillating electric fan mounted on the wall unexpectedly fell due to loose screws, hitting Zhou's head. His skull was shattered, and his brain and blood splattered. The church sent him to Guangci Hospital, but the injury was fatal, and he died. The hospital reported this to the police, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Autopsy Room. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhao from the Special Number Two Court arrived to conduct an investigation. His brother, Zhou Ningsheng, claimed the body. The deceased is survived by his wife and four children, and his wife is pregnant and about to give birth. The Catholic Church will provide compensation to support the family until the children reach adulthood and can support themselves.

### Husband Acquainted with Waitress, Assaults Wife; Sentenced to Five Months in Prison

Yao Wenjun, a native of Zhenjiang who runs a hardware store at No. 814, Binlang Road, was recently reported to the Zhabei Police Department by his wife, He, who stated that Yao was having an affair with a waitress at the Great World Company and often stayed out late. At 11:30 PM on June 17th, she tried to persuade him to stop, but they argued, and he beat her with a wooden stick, causing injuries all over her body. She was treated at Sacred Heart Hospital. The police arrested Yao and sent him to the Special Number One Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng conducted a trial. Ms. He stated that she was currently recovering in the hospital and that the doctor said she would need another month. She also hired a lawyer to file a civil suit, demanding separation, alimony, medical expenses, and convalescence expenses totaling 5,000 yuan. The defendant claimed that Ms. He was not his legal wife but a mistress whom he met before the August 13th Incident. Recently, she had been extravagant and sold household items cheaply, spending the money recklessly. She started arguing with him for no reason, and in a moment of anger, he hit her a few times with a broom handle. He hired lawyer Yin Shouguang to defend him. Judge Huang sentenced Yao Wenjun to five months in prison. If he chooses to pay a fine, it will be calculated at two yuan per day. He was released on bail of 300 yuan pending appeal; otherwise, he will be detained. The civil suit was transferred to the Civil Division of the same court for trial.

### Gambling Den Protector, Female Pimp Sells Young Girls; Verdict Scheduled for the 8th

Chen Rongsheng, a local from Shanghai who worked as a protector at the Zhaofeng Club, was 27 years old. On May 30th of this year, he instigated his wife, Chen Linmei, to go to the Huayang Lacquer Factory in Sanxingfang, Beile Road, with the lure of introducing them to better jobs. He tricked female workers Xia Juxiang, Chen Amao, Chen Yuemei, Zhang Shanlan, and Ni Xiaoling to the Dahua Hotel, No. 414, Simalu, and the Qinghe Hostel, Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road, where they were raped by Chen and his friend Li Zhiming (age 39, from Wuxi). They then contacted brothels run by Fan Wengshi (age 56, from Suzhou), Zhang Hanshi (age 43, from Suzhou), Huang Zhengshi (age 29, from Suzhou), and Wu Chenshi (age 53, from Wuxi) to sell the girls into prostitution. Fortunately, their parents discovered this the next day and reported it to the French police. The French Concession Police and the Public Concession Police jointly dispatched detectives to arrest Chen Rongsheng and others and sent them to the Criminal Division of the Special Number Two Court, where Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the trial. Because the investigation by the French Concession authorities was not yet complete, the trial was postponed. The defendants were returned to custody. Yesterday morning, the trial resumed. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen charged Chen Rongsheng with the crime of raping a girl under the age of sixteen and luring her away from her family under Article 227 of the Criminal Law. Li Zhiming and Chen's wife, Linmei, were charged with the crime of enticement under Article 298, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The remaining defendants, Fan Wengshi, Zhang Hanshi, Huang Zhengshi, and Wu Chenshi, were found to be unrelated and were not charged. Chen Rongsheng and others admitted to raping and luring the girls and hired lawyer Gu Peilun for their defense. After a detailed hearing, the court ordered closing arguments and scheduled the verdict for the 8th. The four defendants who were not charged were released in court.

### Lu Xihou Recovering and Discharged from Hospital

According to Huaguang News Agency, it was reported yesterday that Lu Xihou, former chairman of the China Industrial Bank, was attacked by enemies on a certain day last month and suffered arm and leg injuries. He was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Due to inflammation of his injuries, he was transferred to Fumin Hospital for treatment. According to reporters, Lu's condition has improved greatly after treatment at Baolong Hospital, so he was discharged from the hospital yesterday and returned to his residence in the French Concession to recuperate. He has also hired another doctor for treatment. The rumor that he was transferred to Fumin Hospital is incorrect.

### Poor Woman Steals Rice, Receives Suspended Sentence

Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have been rising, and the poor are unable to make a living, leading them to take risks and steal rice, which is often reported in the newspapers. On the previous day, at 3:30 PM, at the Jiumao Rice Shop at No. 92, Lane 1090, Binlang Road, about 50 or 60 elderly and young poor people with pale faces and thin bodies gathered, each carrying cloth bags and small knives. Without asking questions, they used knives to cut open the rice bags and took more than 50 yuan worth of rice, scattering and fleeing. Two Chinese constables from the Putuo Road Police Station, numbers 2405 and 2903, arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested three Jiangbei women, Wang Chenshi, Yu Pengshi, and Tong Sunshi. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Special Number One Court yesterday. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested leniency. Judge Jiang sentenced each of them to six months in prison, suspended for three years.

### Feng Bingnan Commemorates His Mother's Birthday with Lyrics (5) Actively Promotes the Jianming Dao Standard Commemorates His Mother's Birthday by Holding Three Major Events

The third event is to launch a social welfare business community. Every group of people in a society must have a spirit of mutual assistance, and only then will that group of people evolve. The spirit of mutual assistance and the power of mutual assistance must be developed to the extreme and organized to the utmost perfection, so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of this society. Where does mutual assistance start? It must start with self-help first. One can help others after helping oneself. The so-called "establish yourself before you establish others, and achieve yourself before you achieve others" is what it means. One can get help from others after helping oneself. The so-called "Heaven helps those who help themselves" is what it means. For example, a baby cannot manage his own diet and must rely on his mother's breastfeeding. However, sucking and digestion still require the baby's own efforts. Otherwise, even if there is a breastfeeding mother, he still cannot digest it and will instead stagnate into illness or even perish. Therefore, the spirit of self-help can be fully developed, and naturally, it can achieve social mutual assistance. The purpose of launching a social welfare business community is to promote self-help in society and achieve mutual assistance. The so-called social welfare business has many beginnings, but the most important is the adjustment of having and not having. The so-called having and not having not only refers to wealth but also includes physical strength and intelligence. If having and not having tend to be extreme and cannot be balanced, then the things of usurpation and strife will never end, and society will never have a day of peace. Therefore, adjusting having and not having is the first thing that the social welfare business community should do. Under this principle of adjusting having and not having, we will first carry out five enjoyments, which are the educational personnel subsidy fund, the news workers subsidy fund, the religious subsidy fund, the health mutual insurance association, and the unemployed self-help subsidy fund. The education business is to educate and nurture the next generation of society and train future members of society. If today's society is not good, it is because of the failure of past education. If we want to improve the future of society, we must work hard in the current education. Therefore, education has a very important responsibility to society, and its importance is equivalent to that of a mother to a baby. Therefore, society should bear an inescapable responsibility for those engaged in education and should pay great attention to them. We must respect their work and status, sympathize with their material difficulties, and provide material assistance. Regarding the effectiveness of their work, we should help them improve the old and support the education personnel. If the news force of the world is properly used, it can improve social morality, turn swords into plowshares, and eliminate great disasters invisibly. Because the role of news can penetrate people's hearts, we must respect the mission and dignity of news workers. We must sympathize with the clean and hard life of news workers and provide spiritual and material assistance. As for the relationship between religious undertakings and human society, I have already said it. These three undertakings are the foundation of society, and although their forms are different, their ultimate goals are the same. These three undertakings should seek close cooperation, so that not only can matter be improved, but morality can also be improved. As for a well-organized society, there should not be people who are sick and cannot get medical treatment or medicine, and there should not be diseases that can be prevented but ultimately cannot be prevented. Even food, clothing, and shelter should be available to everyone at a minimum level.

### Guangdong Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Support Various Schools Preparing to Move Back to Guangdong; Sun Yat-sen University to Move Back Completely After the Summer Vacation

(Shaoguan Air News) After the withdrawal from Guangzhou, there is not a single complete university within Guangdong Province, which has a huge impact on the studies of young people. Although the Guangdong Provincial authorities have repeatedly urged universities that have moved out of the province to return to Guangdong in recent years, the school authorities have all said that they cannot do so due to a lack of funds. It has recently been discovered that the central government also believes that the lack of universities within Guangdong Province is a great loss to culture. Sun Yat-sen University has been urged to move back to Guangdong. The new president, Xu Chongqing, has accepted this proposal. The estimated total relocation cost is 500,000 yuan, which was jointly requested from Chairman Li by Minister Chen Lifu, Minister Wang Chonghui, and President Sun Ke in a letter asking the Guangdong Provincial treasury to allocate the full amount. After discussion by the provincial government, it was decided that due to the province's financial constraints, only 300,000 yuan could be allocated. The remaining 200,000 yuan will be requested from the central government. The decision on subsidizing the relocation of Lingnan, National, Guangdong, Zhongkai, and other universities and middle schools back to Guangdong was also discussed. It was decided to consider the circumstances and provide appropriate subsidies according to their needs. It has now been decided that the colleges of agriculture, engineering, and law of Sun Yat-sen University, the College of Agriculture of Lingnan University, the Zhongkai Agricultural School, and the Guangdong National University will expand their Kaiping campus, and the Guangdong College of Arts and Sciences will also increase its enrollment. All relocations are scheduled to occur after the summer vacation.

### Guizhou Province Student Loan Temporary Remedial Measures

(Guilin Air News) The Guizhou Provincial Government, in order to assist students of Guizhou origin studying in domestic colleges and universities, teacher training departments, those receiving partial public funding, and self-funded students of Guizhou origin from war zones in colleges and universities, to continue their studies, has specially formulated three temporary remedial measures for small student loans in Guangxi, which have been announced and implemented. According to the regulations of these temporary remedial measures for student loans: (1) All students of the province studying in domestic colleges and universities, teacher training or education departments, who receive partial public funding (such as miscellaneous fees, tuition, and board), and whose families are truly impoverished, with annual expenses insufficient to maintain their studies, and who still require loan assistance, are specially allowed to apply for loans according to regulations, without being subject to the restrictions of Article 9 of the Guizhou Provincial Student Loan Regulations. However, the amount of the loan requested should be reduced by 20 yuan per year compared to the amount stipulated for self-funded students. (2) Self-funded students of Guizhou origin from war zones studying in domestic colleges and universities, who have already received partial loan assistance, and whose annual study expenses are indeed insufficient and who need to apply for loan assistance again, are still allowed to apply for loans according to regulations. (3) These measures will be announced and implemented from May 29th. If there is a need for modification or repeal, it may be determined by order.

### Sino-British Cultural Association Hong Kong Branch Holds Annual Meeting

Amending Constitution and Electing Officers, Donating a Scholarship and Allocating 400 Yuan Annually

Honorary Secretary Chen Junbao proposed amending the association's constitution, adding the following article under Article 8 of the original constitution: "The Hong Kong Branch of the Sino-British Cultural Association should have two to four honorary presidents. Each honorary president should be nominated by the current committee. The term of office for honorary presidents is one year, but they may be re-elected." After discussion, it was passed, but the phrase "two to four" was deleted, and the number of honorary presidents would be determined by the committee. The proposal to nominate Ye Gongchao and Lin Yutang as honorary presidents, nominated by the current committee, was passed. Mrs. Situ Yongjue proposed inviting Madam Sun Yat-sen to serve as honorary president, which was referred to the committee for a decision. The list of new committee members elected that day is as follows: Honorary Presidents: Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote, Schlosser, Ye Gongchao, Lin Yutang; Committee Members: Professor Xu Dishan (Chairman), Sir Lo Yuk-ho (Vice-Chairman), Chen Junbao (Honorary Secretary), Jia Xidi, Chao Kunlin, He Hua, Bishop Ming, Xu Naibo, Lo Man-kam, Mrs. Situ Yongjue, Professor Simpson, Wen Yuanning, Cao Shanyou, Lin Wojiang.

The scholarship would be 400 yuan per year, allocated from the branch's membership fees. Any shortfall would be raised through donations from members. After discussion, it was passed.

### International Table Tennis Tournament Ends, Awards Ceremony Tonight

8:00 PM at the West YMCA Hall, Chinese Team Wins Five Group Championships and Runners-Up

The International Table Tennis Association-sponsored International Cup All-Shanghai Team Table Tennis Championship, with 57 Chinese and Western male and female teams participating, divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and Women's), has concluded after more than four months of competition. All the champions and runners-up of each group were won by Chinese teams, winning unprecedented glory in the international table tennis world. In the Sino-Western Charity Match previously held at the Lido Ballroom, A Qingyun won the main battle of that group against their foreign counterpart by a score of 13 to 5. It was undoubtedly the group's championship. However, in last week's match against Peide, they were temporarily absent, resulting in forfeiture. Thus, like their foreign counterpart, they had a record of ten wins and one loss, forming a tie. However, based on the record of wins and losses between the two teams, the foreign team had more. Therefore, that group will no longer be re-decided. The championship goes to the foreign team, and A Qingyun is relegated to runner-up. The association's authorities have scheduled a grand awards ceremony for tonight (2nd) at 8:00 PM in the table tennis room on the third floor of the West YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. Members of the association, including Yu Binqi, Chen Linsheng, Xu Duo, Di Fei, Bao Aisheng, Sha Sijin, and Fu Liutuo, will be present to preside over the event. The list of champions from the five groups is recorded below: (Group A) Champion: Foreign Team, Runner-up: A Qingyun; (Group B) Champion: Jiufeng, Runner-up: A Nanyang; (Group C) Champion: A Jianwu, Runner-up: A Jiafa; (Group D) Champion: B Jianwu, Runner-up: B Nanyang; (Women's Group) Champion: Hualian Women, Runner-up: Qing Women.

Commercial News

### Yarn and Cotton, Half a Month, Yarn Price Plummets, Down by Over 1,000 Yuan

Today's yarn and cotton market was closed due to the semi-annual settlement of silver and money businesses, and commerce followed suit. After the cotton yarn's wild rise and sharp fall, the trend has gradually entered a state of calm. However, the situation in Vietnam is tight, and the transportation of Shanghai's defenses cannot be difficult, affecting the cotton yarn market. Since May 4th, the current price of 20-count Shuangma was raised to 1,765 yuan, and the futures price reached 1,825 yuan. Until June 28th, it plummeted to 800 yuan, a difference of 1,025 yuan in just half a month. From this point of view, the downturn may temporarily be over. However, the unrest in the South China Sea has greatly affected South China's commerce, and the Guangdong merchants are therefore hesitant and hesitant to move forward. Some have changed their route and are shipping from the Zhejiang province. Recently, the Ningbo merchants have been more active in purchasing coarse and fine yarns, but the amount of packages is not huge. The future of the yarn market depends on the actual situation, and progress depends on whether it can be flexible.

Indian cotton continues to arrive in Shanghai. Last Wednesday, the Yaji Lun loaded 6,000 pieces, which was previously reported. It is now known that the Great Britain Company's Pongelo ship arrived in Shanghai last Saturday (29th) from London, and loaded 1,803 pieces of cotton in Mumbai. It is currently docked at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading.

However, although foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, the manipulation of rice merchants remains the same, and there is no sign of restraint. (Zu)

### Financial Commentary

— Sheng Kaiqiong

——Up to June 28th——

(1) Planning the Foundation of the Four Banks' Financial Network

Since the center of military operations shifted to the interior, the center of finance closely followed, moving inland to coordinate with and adapt to the progress of the military campaign. However, the relocation of the financial center is by no means simply moving the core leadership of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China (the "Four Banks") to the interior, which would then make the interior the financial center of China. It is essential to weave a financial network in the interior to unleash the power of the center, so that it can meet the needs of military, political, transportation, and communication requirements, and invigorate or adjust finance to develop production.

Since the Four Banks began planning the financial network in the interior, they have proceeded in three phases. The first phase has already been completed amidst difficult conditions, with a total of 189 new branches established in the vast Southwest and Northwest regions. However, due to the urgent needs of military, political, economic, transportation, and industrial sectors, various parties are still requesting the Four Banks' Joint Office to establish branches. Furthermore, the Four Banks' Joint Office, in order to promote agricultural loans, also deems it necessary to further add branches in the interior. Therefore, taking into account the actual conditions in various regions, the second and third phase financial network plans have been formulated, intending to add a total of eighty more branches in the western, northern, and southern provinces of China's war of resistance and national reconstruction base areas, such as Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guangdong, Hubei, Guangxi, and Guizhou, which will be set up by the four government banks separately.

However, the government banks have already established a considerable number of branches in the interior. In important places, there are often branches of more than two government banks. Under the unified planning of the Four Banks' Joint Office, it is indeed unnecessary for two government banks to exist in places where no branches have yet been established. At the same time, under the government's financial policies, commercial banks and provincial local banks maintain close ties and full cooperation with the government banks. Therefore, the first principle of planning the financial network is "to take overall planning and cooperation as the principle, avoid duplication, and in areas where a designated branch has already been established, or where there is a commercial bank or provincial bank with outstanding performance, the Four Banks will not establish another branch." Secondly, the current Four Banks are important economic combat organizations in the war of resistance and national reconstruction. The expansion of this organization must overcome any potential dangers and resolve practical difficulties. At the same time, the expansion of this organization must be beneficial to the invigoration of finance and the development of industry, in order to adapt to or coordinate with the needs of military, political, transportation, and communication. Therefore, the second principle of planning the financial network is "to establish branches throughout the interior, but due to inconvenient transportation, lack of personnel, difficulty in finding housing, security issues, and other practical difficulties, once recognized by the Four Banks, they must proceed to set up branches on schedule, and must not shirk responsibility on any pretext." The third principle is "newly established branches should focus on handling the following businesses: (1) strive to collect gold and silver, (2) actively handle savings, (3) fully utilize deposited banknotes, promote small-denomination currency, exchange damaged banknotes, (4) adhere to the principle of secured lending when granting loans, (5) facilitate remittances to the interior, (6) strive to handle agricultural, forestry, industrial, and mining loans, (7) pay attention to local economic conditions and materials, (8) branches near war zones should closely monitor the economic and financial situation of the Japanese puppet regime."

The achievements in planning the financial network in the interior are already quite good. To a certain extent, the interior has already become a Chinese financial center with considerable strength. However, the Four Banks have not yet succeeded in becoming a link in a fully-fledged economic combat organization. It still depends on the planning of the financial network, until its completion. Only then can the interior become a powerful financial center of "Free China"!

(2) General Rules for Small Industrial and Commercial Loans

The Executive Yuan promulgated and implemented the nineteen articles of the "General Rules for Local Financial Institutions Handling Small Industrial and Commercial Loans" on May 25th of this year, which stipulated detailed regulations for loan methods, amounts, and repayment methods. The implementation of this measure is undoubtedly a step forward in China's wartime financial policy, not only providing a great impetus to the social economy of "Free China," but also enabling the financial industry of "Free China"—especially the business of provincial and municipal banks—to expand in many aspects.

According to the provisions of the general rules, the qualifications for small industries are that the products can be used for military purposes or sold abroad, or belong to the industries of daily necessities designated by Article 2 of the "Measures for the Price-Controlled Purchase and Sale of Daily Necessities" by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The qualifications for small businesses are that they engage in the sale of daily necessities designated by Article 2 of the "Measures for the Price-Controlled Purchase and Sale of Daily Necessities" by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Both of these must also have the common qualification of joining their respective trade associations. Under the conditions of credit guarantee or property guarantee, the amount of loans that can be enjoyed is limited to three thousand yuan for small businesses and twenty thousand yuan for small industries. The obligation borne is an interest rate that cannot exceed nine per mille per month. If the loan is less than five hundred yuan, an application can be made to reduce the interest rate appropriately.

In the past, the financial policies adopted in China, such as the rediscounting method, the outline for improving local financial institutions, and the measures for expanding agricultural loans, did not offer any preferences for small industries and businesses. At the same time, the guarantees for loans in these measures were mostly biased towards property guarantees. Therefore, the financial industry's irrigation of small industries and businesses was also fruitless. Now, the "General Rules for Small Industrial and Commercial Loans" have four types of guarantee methods: guarantee by one reputable business or factory, joint and several guarantee by two people with good reputation in society, and the other two are mortgage loans. The guarantee methods emphasize both people and property, breaking the past system of the financial industry exclusively granting loans based on property guarantees, and adopting the conservative lending methods of Chinese money shops that value credit. The vast majority of "Free China" is still stuck on the lifeline of agricultural economy. Assisting the development of small industries and businesses to increase the supply of daily necessities is actually what is needed in this great era of resistance and reconstruction, and adopting this method is a prerequisite. It is repeated here that the implementation of this measure is undoubtedly a step forward in China's wartime financial policy.

As an aside, the content of these general rules was only recently disseminated to Shanghai. However, some local newspapers claimed that the local money industry was going to handle small industrial and commercial loans. I think the news agency that sent the news did not read the words "by local financial institutions (provincial and municipal bank branches)" in the first article of the general rules!

(3) Further Strengthening the Compilation of the Official Price of the Pound Sterling

According to a telegram from New York on June 27th, a new regulation completely prohibiting the use of free pounds will be announced soon. At the same time, it is widely believed that all goods exported from the United Kingdom and British territories will be calculated at the official pound exchange rate. Therefore, under the influence of importers scrambling to purchase pounds, the pound rose sharply in the New York market that day, with a peak of 4.01 and a closing price of 4.0025.

Since the outbreak of the war, the United Kingdom has taken two sets of measures for foreign exchange control. The first set of controls was implemented on September 3, 1939. For goods exported to countries with clearing agreements, the official exchange rate could be used to settle in pounds sterling through official channels. The only use for free pounds was to pay for the freight of British ships and travel expenses in the UK. The current news from New York that all goods exported from the UK and the British Empire will soon be calculated at the official pound exchange rate is probably the implementation of this regulation.

In theory, this regulation is sufficient to prevent the continued increase in the balance of free pounds. However, no one knows how much the current balance of pounds is. Assuming that the balance is still large and cannot be used to pay for British goods, then there will be ample pounds sold at prices lower than the official exchange rate. Therefore, the pound still has two prices, official and free, and the free pound exchange rate will still fluctuate due to the shifting European situation.

(4) Foreign Exchange and Foreign Stocks

The fluctuations in foreign exchange this week were smaller than in the previous week. Gold was no more than 15,625, and the US dollar was no more than 375. At the same time, because of the rumors of the devaluation of the US dollar and the strengthening of pound control, the Shanghai exchange rate for the British pound tended to tighten, while the exchange rate for the US dollar tended to lengthen. The strengthening of pound control has already been mentioned above, and here we will briefly discuss the devaluation of the US dollar. Since the pound fell in price, it did cause panic among American exporters and manufacturers competing with British goods, but only a portion of British exports are subject to free pound control, which does not have a significant impact on the United States. Now that all British exports must be paid for in the official price of the pound, the panic mentioned above can be eliminated. Moreover, the current situation is far from comparable to the situation in 1931 and 1932, when the fall of the pound resulted in a corresponding decrease in American prices. The current situation is the opposite, so there is no need for the US dollar to devalue at this time.

Foreign stocks showed a significant and extreme downturn in the week of the half-year settlement. The transaction value for the week ending June 14 was 11.5 million yuan, which the Public Association said was the lowest record since December last year. However, for the week ending June 28, it was only 11 million yuan. The weakness of the market and the helplessness of speculators can be imagined. The average market price was highest on the 3rd of June and lowest on the 28th of June, a straight downward slope.

### Fluctuations in Silver Dollars (2)

Recently, due to the release of new silk on the market, the villagers selling silk must obtain silver dollars in cash, so both the exchange rate and the commission on silver dollars rose simultaneously. Later, as the price of new silk fell slightly, buyers were not very enthusiastic, and the price of silver dollars also returned slightly. It can be seen that the rise and fall of the current price of silver dollars depends entirely on the success or failure of the silk and tea markets. The tea market is not very promising this year, while the new silk has been priced up since it was released, which is very different from last year. Money industry insiders specialize in taking advantage of this kind of situation to profit. Villagers carrying silk to the market will not sell unless they get silver dollars in cash, so the commission on silver dollars is immediately increased. However, silk dealers also suffer no small losses. Why? Because none of the silk dealers do not have connections with money shops. The price of silver dollars is expensive, and the commission is heavy, and the villagers are unwilling to sell silk cheaply. If the silk is collected and the price of silver dollars falls, the depreciation loss can be imagined. Extending this, the rise and fall of the price of silver dollars is uncertain, and it is difficult for all industries to be independent. In addition, the ban on empty speculation has not been completely eliminated, and it is feared that many people will lose their capital and go bankrupt as a result. Recently, the money shops in Shanghai mostly make transactions with immediate cash entry and exit, and do not engage in empty speculation. However, the settlement is also scheduled for two or three days. The advantages and disadvantages of this are even more difficult to fully understand. This is a unique concern for the market. The current amount of silver dollars in this port is probably not very large. It was previously heard that someone contacted a certain shop to exchange fifty silver dollars, and even though it was a shop that they had been dealing with for a long time, and not an unfamiliar person, they could not get the exchange immediately.

### Raincoat

— Wu Wangchuan

It hasn't rained for more than a month. Disaster news from various places is being published in the newspapers one after another. "It will be terrible if it doesn't rain again." This sentence is often on people's lips. Even the young masters and misses who are usually indifferent feel that not raining again will have a considerable impact on them. Although they have not reached the point of praying to gods and worshiping Buddhas, they will say that it should rain today when they see the sky is overcast!

Heaven has eyes and lives up to expectations. It has been raining for the past two days.

It rained, but my body never dried with it. Yesterday morning, I walked from home to school through a not-so-short road. I didn't wear a raincoat or hold an umbrella. I just walked quickly along the wall. Needless to say, my body was soaked.

When I arrived in the classroom, I saw many classmates admiring the good rain through the glass windows. When they turned around and saw that I was drenched in the rain, several of them called me to take off my wet clothes and dry them, and several others were admiring my wet body, meaning that the rain was lovely.

"Why are you so dumb? You didn't take a car or bring a raincoat!" one classmate said to me with concern.

"Raincoat, oh! My raincoat was lost long ago," I said sadly.

Indeed, every time I think of a raincoat now, I remember something. "Raincoat" can give me a warm shadow, a memory that can never be erased.

A week after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, I really couldn't stand the threat of airplanes, so I walked from Datian to the Shanghai Concession with my family. It was a rare rainy early morning. Along the way, apart from the sound of artillery fire in the distance, there was the sound of raindrops hitting the cobblestone road. There was no one nearby, and no cars. After walking for a while, we heard the sound of a car behind us. Looking back, we saw a truck carrying wounded soldiers speeding by. Just as it passed us, the body of the truck shook because it was driving through a pond, and a wounded soldier rolled down from the back of the truck. I quickly yelled at the truck that continued to drive forward, but the driver didn't hear it because of the sound of the rain, or he was afraid that we wanted to ride in his car, so he kept accelerating forward. When I turned back and walked to the wounded soldier, I saw him lying face down, with his legs bent. I quickly laid him flat. Looking at him, I saw that his skull was broken, and the red and white pulp was mixed with mud. He was also bleeding from his mouth. I don't know if he had any other injuries on his body. After my mother's examination, she said that he had already died? My younger brother—who was only ten years old at the time—heard that he was dead, and he quickly took off his raincoat and fearlessly covered the corpse. He didn't want a soldier that he usually respected to be drenched in the rain after he died, but his raincoat was too small to cover only the head and chest of the corpse. At this time, my younger brother looked up at me, and I was ashamed to take off my raincoat and put it on top of my younger brother's raincoat. We stood silently for a while, facing each other.

Since this decision, I have not worn a raincoat. Several times my mother wanted me to accompany my younger brother to buy a raincoat, but my younger brother always replied, "The soldiers on the front lines can still fight hard while bathing in blood, so can't we bear a little rain?"

### The Key to Wisdom

— Yang Tongfang

Three years ago, a professor once said to me, "If you want to gain a rich life experience, you should read more 'big books.' From there, you can understand the value of life." He also tirelessly explained the meaning of "big books," saying that "big books" do not only refer to huge works with large volumes, but books that can reflect the thinking of an era and point out the correct attitude towards life. They enable people to grasp the core of an idea, and especially to stir the heartstrings of readers, and even change people's ideals of life as a result.

Since being inspired by this professor, I have deeply felt that the purpose of reading is not to accumulate fragmented knowledge or memorize rigid rules, but to absorb life experiences, pick out the great truths that have been polished over a long period of time in history, or select the objective ideas that best represent the era from books, so as to make improvements. The information of life allows all our activities to have a most reasonable and sublime goal to follow.

Therefore, the books read in ordinary schools cannot necessarily satisfy us. Their shortcomings are that they are too far removed from real life and practice, and because they are all written with serious faces, they are often full of a strong Confucian spirit and lack intimate and touching elements. Of course, textbooks and general introductory guides still have their uses for those who are new to the door of knowledge and cannot be completely denied; but we must seek the great thoughts and the halls of knowledge from "big books."

The attitude we should have when reading is to move from absorbing other people's thoughts to using our own thoughts. The knowledge in books must be able to help people make effective adaptations in life and have the function of guiding life and improving life. Only "big books" can express the greatness of the power of books.

Tolstoy once said, "The ideal book is the key to wisdom." After listening to the professor's words, I realized the use of this key to wisdom even more. Unfortunately, only a few people know how to use it to open the treasure trove of human thought.

Hawthorne Detective Story

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Two "A Page of the Past!"

Hawthorne brought the paper close to the mouth of the silver-plated ashtray and flicked off some ashes. His attitude was still very calm. However, Ni Jinshou's expression was noticeably different. His face fell, his eyes flashed with anger, and he was clearly disgusted by the maid's cunning.

He said loudly, "Mr. Hawthorne, we don't need to waste any more words. Since she refuses to tell the truth, let's take her away." He immediately stood up, his hands back on his waist.

This demonstrative posture did have some small gains, because Jinmei glanced at Detective Ni, and her previous seemingly unshakable composure had obviously been discounted by three points.

Hawthorne waved his hand and said gently, "Detective Ni, please sit down. I don't think Jinmei is a fool and would never be foolish enough to 'refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit.'... Jinmei, don't panic. Now, just tell me what you know truthfully, and it will have nothing to do with you. I ask you, is this Yu Gantang a friend of your master? Is that right?"

Jinmei initially only nodded, paused, and then automatically added, "I think Miss Jiang's words are just guesses."

Hawthorne replied, "That's right. Her words certainly can't be counted. Now, answer me first. I think the friendship between the two of them must be good. He must often spend the night here. Right?"

"Not often. Miss Wang only let him stay here when Manager Lu was not here."

"Then Manager Lu always lives here often. I saw the pair of men's slippers under the long chair and the gold-headed cane in the corner. They are probably Manager Lu's things."

I was sitting on one end of the long chair, and I couldn't see the slippers under the chair. I looked down and saw a pair of brown velvet soft-soled men's slippers and a pair of pink velvet striped women's slippers. The cane was planted in the corner next to the bookshelf.

Jinmei nodded and said, "Yes. But Manager Lu doesn't live here often either, at most once or twice a week."

Hawthorne blew a puff of smoke and nodded, "Well, I understand. I guess this Yu has recently had some disagreements with your master. Right?"

The woman seemed to have considered it again. "They had an argument." (32)

### Hong Jingling Talks About the Early Chinese Film Industry The First Film Was "Living Monk"

— Taigong

In the Chinese film circle today, the most popular star seems to be Chen Yunshang. But perhaps some people don't know who is the oldest and has the longest history among the stars. Here, let me tell you, it is Hong Jingling, who is good at playing comedy and villainous roles.

Yesterday, the reporter met Hong Jingling at Dingxiang Garden and talked to him about the development history of the Chinese film industry. He told the reporter about the early budding of Chinese films, saying:

It was about thirty years ago, wasn't it? A Westerner with yellow hair came to Shanghai and started a film business at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. He founded the Asia Film Company and brought together general drama actors such as Zheng Zhengqiu, Zhang Shichuan, and Qian Huarui to make movies. He made a "Living Monk," which can be said to be the first Chinese film.

Soon after, Hollywood's Universal Company came to Shanghai to make a movie. After the film was made, it was borrowed from the Photography Department of the Commercial Press for washing and printing. The film was called "Golden Lotus." Later, the Commercial Press also established a film department and began making movies, making more than a dozen films such as "Death to Gambling" and "Firewood Room Girl."

Later, the New Asia Company was established. Until 1919, Bu Wancang, Yu Huidong, and others jointly established the China Film Company. From that time on, the film industry gradually developed. The film department of the Commercial Press was renamed Guoguang Company. At the same time, Great Wall Company, Changming Company, and Star Company also appeared one after another. Up to now, although the Chinese film industry has made a lot of progress, it still needs to be created.

### Reflections on "The Ship of Lost Souls"

(1)

I remember a certain scholar once said in an article that doctors can be divided into five classes: those who dedicate themselves to research, make discoveries, benefit humanity, and leave a lasting legacy are of the first class. Looking at Ehrlich, who went through hardships, never giving up, disregarding his own interests, even forgetting sleep and food, and becoming ill as a result, yet still researching during his illness, truly a great courage. His motivation was to save people, and his passion for saving people was unrestrained, overcoming obstacles, truly a great benevolence. The three medical saints Ehrlich, Koch, and Behring, active on the screen, truly express the spirit of the German nation, which cannot be compared to those who claim kingship and hegemony. Whether in the medical field or not, young and old alike should watch this film. The wonder of the makeup and expressions, the vividness of several microbe shots, are breathtaking. Looking at the entire film, there is absolutely nothing improper. Its greatness can be compared to "The Story of Louis Pasteur," and its brilliance may even surpass it. Why the advertisement prohibits children under the age of sixteen is truly puzzling to me. I petition to abolish this ban and, after it is shown at the Grand Theater, have it repeatedly screened in second-run theaters, so that schoolchildren and young people can watch this great and wholesome film during their vacations. That would be fortunate indeed.

"The Ship of Lost Souls" is being shown at the Grand Theater. This is a biographical educational film about Dr. Paul Ehrlich's invention of the "606" syphilis drug. Ehrlich's lifelong struggle for medicine is very inspiring. He said: Science requires rationality. Therefore, the first stage was the invention of dyes for observing lung bacteria, the second stage was the invention of diphtheria serum, and the final stage was the invention of syphilis drugs in the sixth attempt. The story gives viewers a significant lesson, illustrating that the study of things should have a spirit of great fearlessness. At the same time, on his deathbed, he left a last will, saying: Incurable diseases, I have finally researched a drug to save people, but we should heal the souls of people even more, until mankind can be free and equal, strive, strive, strive!

After watching it with Dr. Zhang Kelun, he said: I am precisely accepting Ehrlich's legacy, spreading seeds of happiness to countless patients, so I am particularly moved, and I hope that thousands of colleagues at sea can go and see this film, so that they can work hard in their own positions.

### About Chen Lifang

— Kuizhang

Geng Xin and Liang Xiaoluan returned to Ping today. The rear team includes Tan Fuying, Chen Lifang, etc. The Shanghai opera circles are of course very familiar with Tan Fuying, my mother said, because he has been singing in Shanghai for many years.

Here, I would like to briefly describe Chen Lifang's artistic history, because this is only his second time coming to Shanghai. Some people think he is a female role performer, but in reality he is a young man. He started learning opera at the age of nine, his first teacher was Zhu Youfen, and he started performing on stage at the age of fifteen, often performing with Ma Lianliang, Yang Xiaolou, etc. At the age of twenty-six, through the introduction of Jin Zhongsun, he became a student of Cheng Yanqiu, one of the four famous dan performers, and studied in depth for a year. Then he came to Shanghai with Gai Jiaotian, Yang Baosen, etc., performing at the Great Stage.

This year he is thirty years old. In the meantime, he has been to Nanjing, Harbin, Liaoning and other places to sing, and he has also been to Hankou with Li Wanchun, singing for twenty days. His father, Chen Fusheng, was also in the opera world, but he has now passed away. He has two brothers, who also sing opera. His proudest works are "Yu Tang Chun," "Wu Jia Po," and "June Snow."

### Hong Kong Film News

— Haixing

(1)

A certain person in the film industry came to Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday. According to him, the situation in Hong Kong is becoming tense, and film companies are planning to relocate. Nan Yue has decided to relocate to Shanghai, Nan Yang Company will relocate to Singapore, and Da Guan Company has not yet decided. Hong Kong film companies are more numerous than those in Shanghai, but most of them do not have their own studios. They only gather considerable capital, temporarily invite personnel, and rent other people's places to make a film. If Nan Yue, Nan Yang, Da Guan, etc. relocate, then these companies will have to declare a shutdown.

(2)

Chinese people living in Hong Kong are all planning to evacuate. "What about Hu Die, who is now living in Hong Kong?" The reporter asked the relevant parties about this. According to reports, Hu Die herself wants to return to Shanghai, but Pan Yousheng does not want to come north, or may go to Manila with Hu Die, which is also unknown.)

According to news from Yi Hua Company, Li Qinian can come to Shanghai to work at any time. He is currently preparing to write a script that can match the personality of this "patriotic artist."

### Odds and Ends from the Art World

The Xin Yi Opera Troupe organized by Yu Sulian, after performing in Ningbo, a letter with a group photo from the troupe members Liang Jueshan, a famous female impersonator, and Gu Yulan, stated that the performance was not satisfactory and they will return to Shanghai at the end of this month.

The actor troupe hosted by the villain Wang Xianzai on the screen caused quite a stir during the Long March inland. Recently, someone plans to revive the actor troupe and is preparing for a public performance, because more than half of the members of the actor troupe have remained in Shanghai.

Longevity Kettle’s Opera Talk

### A Joint Discussion of Tan Fuying and Ma Lianliang (Part 1)

— Su Shaoqing

Ma Lianliang's performance at the Golden Theater has just come to a successful conclusion, and Tan Fuying has emerged as a dark horse and will be performing on the Geng Xin stage. These two outstanding Lao Sheng performers are showcasing their skills one after the other. Is the fortune of Shanghai people's eyes and ears not better than elsewhere? Friends often ask me about the strengths and weaknesses of Ma and Tan because I know a little about opera. I originally didn't want to say much, but since so many people have asked me, I will write this answer.

The two are both Beijing opera performers, both from the same class, both sing Lao Sheng roles, both enjoy great fame, and are about the same age. In terms of seniority, Tan is more qualified. In terms of age, Lianliang became famous earlier. They are almost evenly matched. However, the two have different strengths and different paths. Now I can discuss them. Lao Sheng can be divided into three categories: An Gong, which is singing skills; Shuai Pai, which is acting skills; and Kao Ba, which is martial skills. I have seen Tan and Ma both perform "Dingjun Mountain," and they are comparable. Although Tan is slightly better, neither is their main skill, so it can be ignored. Examining their specialties, Tan is good at An Gong, while Ma is good at Shuai Pai. They have different talents and different skills. They have gone their separate ways and both have become famous. Each is able to use their strengths. An Gong emphasizes singing, with acting as a supplement. Shuai Pai emphasizes acting, with singing as a supplement. It's not that Tan can't act, or that Ma can't sing, but the classification is based on which type of play has more of which element and which achieves better results. Looking at Ma's plays at the Golden Mountain, from the beginning to the end, he mostly performed "Ganlu Temple," "Borrowing the East Wind," "Four Jinshi," and "Qingfeng Pavilion," as well as "Three Mothers Teach Son," "Killing the Family by Fishing," and "Zhuangyuan Pu," which are also Shuai Pai plays. For singing plays like "Empty City Stratagem" and "Bumping the Tablet," he hardly moves. Lianliang has witty acting, stylish makeup, and improved costumes. He performs more Shuai Pai plays, which allows him to use his strengths, save effort, and attract audiences. Why not do it? Looking at the three days of plays advertised by Shi Xinzhang and Fuying, "Empty City Stratagem" opened the first shot. This play is originally a Paoxi for An Gong Lao Sheng, and is also the Sazhou Gang of Tan school plays. In the past, his grandfather Yingxiu performed this, entering the spirit and transforming. Opera fans still remember it today. The second day's "Qi Yuan Bao" is also an An Gong play. "Dingjun Mountain" is placed on the third day, showing that it can be relied on, but decided by An Gong. Paoxi are like samples of goods. Looking at the arrangement and decision, you can know its fineness. Therefore, I say that Fuying is good at An Gong. (I listened to Fuying perform this play the year before last, and I remember that he sang "Yan Qian Zhe" best. For example, the Shan character in "Kao Shan Jin Shui" is wide and bright, extremely clear and full, and no one can match it nowadays).
