### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Urges the National People to Vigorously Implement the General Mobilization of the Spirit Program, Striving for Practicality and Diligence, Advocating Work Competition to Increase Production and Complete Construction, Enriching National Monthly Meetings to Promote Wartime Life, and Victory and Light are Already in Sight

Chongqing. The 12th was the first anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement. Chairman Chiang gave a radio address at 7 p.m., roughly stating: "Today is the 15th anniversary of the death of the Prime Minister. On this day last year, I announced the General Mobilization of the National Spirit Program to all compatriots, and told the military and civilians of the country to (implement spiritual mobilization in a concrete way to commemorate our Prime Minister). I further encourage my compatriots to be consistent inside and out, and not to regard this move as commonplace. We must use spiritual improvement, manifested in practical behavior, to complete our great cause of resistance and national construction. It has been a full year since this program was promulgated. During this year, although the progress of the war of resistance has been very arduous, and the changes in the international situation have been very slow, our military and civilians across the country have been able to remain as firm as mountains and as swift as thunder, united and persevering in their struggle. Finally, the Japanese have been dealt a head-on blow militarily, and all their cunning and insidious political strategies have failed to succeed. This past year has indeed laid the foundation for our final victory, and it is also that they have suffered a fatal blow from us, creating their decisive defeat. Our soldiers on the entire front line have sacrificed their lives, and compatriots at home and abroad have donated money and effort, enthusiastically serving the public. The compatriots in the occupied areas have not only worked hard to resist the enemy, but have also been able to contribute financially to the country. As for the wounded soldiers, they have returned to the battlefield, and the able-bodied young men have been competing to join the army. In addition, the enthusiasm of the people in the war zone to assist the army, and the efforts of the production elements to build, both in terms of regional distribution and quantitative planning, have doubled compared to before. Foreign observers, all those who have come to China to inspect, have all admitted that China has an inviolable power and the certainty of victory. And the basis of their comprehensive argument is that the Chinese people have realized that the Chinese national spirit has made more determined progress in the two and a half years of the war of resistance. When holding the Spiritual Mobilization Commemoration today, I cannot deny that my Spiritual Mobilization has had considerable gains. I cannot but express my gratitude to the compatriots in various places who are enthusiastic about promoting Spiritual Mobilization and implementing Spiritual Mobilization. However, I know that Spiritual Mobilization is not only a work of education and enlightenment, but also a work to be universally implemented. The function of Spiritual Mobilization is not only to invigorate our spirit in order to achieve victory in the war of resistance, but also to encourage each other and intensify our struggle during this wartime to create a new atmosphere of striving for progress and upward mobility, so that all the construction necessary for our national construction can be completed very quickly. Therefore, we cannot be complacent with the current small number of achievements. On the contrary, we must strictly examine ourselves and constantly encourage ourselves to expand our achievements and correct our current shortcomings. Everyone must still remember the three points specifically mentioned in the conclusion of the General Mobilization of the Spirit Program: (1) it must be thorough, (2) it must be lasting, and (3) it must be persevering. Now, if we honestly examine it, we will know that the implementation of Spiritual Mobilization has not yet achieved these three key points. What is called thorough? Thorough means to do it thoroughly inside and out. Everything instructed by the program and stipulated by the National Covenant must be fully accepted and fully implemented. We cannot take one part and ignore the other, nor can we only achieve passive conditions without implementing active conditions. What is called lasting? It means to continue to work hard without interruption. We cannot be enthusiastic for a short time and then give up, nor can we start something and not finish it. For example, our National Monthly Meeting is held once a month. If only the day of the monthly meeting is tense, then we will never receive any benefits. What is perseverance? It means to be firm and unyielding. Today, we are fully engaged in the war of resistance. The difficulties of wartime are increasing day by day, and the closer we get to victory and success, the more profound our hardships and difficulties will be. If we can only withstand ordinary difficulties, but cannot endure extraordinary hardships, cannot withstand oppression, and cannot withstand torment, then no matter how慷慨激昂we are, it cannot be considered as implementing Spiritual Mobilization. Now our national patriotic heart is very strong, our understanding of national righteousness is very widespread, and our belief in the war of resistance is very firm. However, there are really not many people who can fully achieve these three general points. I have carefully observed the reason, and it is really because our people still cannot reform our biggest shortcoming for many years, which is the so-called lack of practicality. I believe that one of the virtues most worthy of our emulation in modern countries is "practicality." Their research is really serious research, their learning is also really serious learning, their work is serious work, and their service is serious service. They are always full of a meticulous spirit at any time and any place, so their attitude is always positive and their work is always practical. Our ancestors were also like this. The so-called seeking truth from facts and striving for excellence are explanations of this spirit. But what is our general situation now? We accept an ideal very casually, and promise something very easily, but when it comes to implementation, we always muddle through. The atmosphere of (念念茲在茲) mentioned by our predecessors is rarely seen among our people now. May I ask, in the process of our war of resistance and national construction, the people have the responsibility of public service, the responsibility of education and propaganda, the responsibility of grassroots work, and even the general public originally has their own solemn tasks, but how many people can "心在事上"? How many people can be conscientious, not whitewash, not intermittent, and really and practically do it to the end? If this atmosphere is allowed to spread, even if we have very good methods, and even if there are some very loyal and striving soldiers and people, the mission we want to achieve will never be fully completed. This kind of atmosphere should have been corrected in peacetime, and it should be reformed in wartime, especially. If we still cannot develop a (practical) atmosphere in this wartime of life and death, and all our work is still irresponsible, then it is no different from everyone treating their personal life and death and the survival of the race as a child's play. In this way, is the future of the country and the nation not extremely dangerous? Therefore, on today's anniversary of Spiritual Mobilization, I ask our compatriots to be sure to put in a lot of effort to temper and cleanse themselves in the word (practical). We should start from here in promoting Spiritual Mobilization in the future. I believe that it is not difficult to (worship reality and eliminate falsehood) and cultivate a universal serious atmosphere. We only need to thoroughly reform the habit of aiming high and being fond of empty talk that has been accumulated over the years, to make propaganda not empty, plans not broad, and all work not divorced from reality. In this way, we will surely be able to persevere, be thorough, be persevering, be able to do it practically, be able to do it hard, and be able to do it tough, so that all our efforts will generate the greatest strength. From now on, if we want to invigorate the spirit of the people, we must first rectify the spirit of the people. If we want to popularize the general mobilization of the national spirit, we must first make the compatriots who have sworn the National Covenant really and practically do the very simple twelve clauses listed in the oath. At the same time, if we want to create a new atmosphere, we must first encourage new driving forces. If we want to complete a great cause, we must first call on our compatriots to start from concrete things that are close to ease. Based on these key points, I have specifically explained the above-mentioned matters to our compatriots as a guideline for our current promotion of Spiritual Mobilization and as a reference for our efforts to popularize Spiritual Mobilization. First, we must implement the program. There are five major points in the General Mobilization of the Spirit Program that we announced last year. There were originally provisions for implementation. Now we must further make them simple and concrete matters, so that the meaning of Spiritual Mobilization can be expressed in practical work. For example, if we want to correct the life of drunkenness and death, we must first ban opium and gambling, ban extravagance, advocate simplicity, practice thrift and savings. If we want to cultivate a vigorous and vigorous spirit, we must first pay attention to neatness and cleanliness, promote physical education and hygiene, and promote the healthy physique of the people. If we want to break the habit of苟且偷生, we must first vigorously implement work inspections, pay attention to being accurate and fast, advocate being active and striving, regard not being loyal to our duties as the greatest shame, and regard actively serving in the army as the greatest honor. If we want to break the attempt to be selfish and self-interested, then we must eliminate the evil atmosphere of貪汙欺僞, get rid of the crime of囤積居奇, and realize the creed of concentrating will and concentrating strength to cultivate the personality of modern citizens. If we want to correct the divergent and complicated thoughts, then we must first practice the oath of the supremacy of the country and the supremacy of the nation, advocate the habit of abiding by laws and strictly observing discipline, supervise each other, encourage each other, and make the general public respect the wartime national responsibilities and regard the dignity of wartime government orders as the same as the military orders in the army, and jointly achieve the goal of military first and victory first. If our compatriots can first achieve these few points, they will have achieved most of the requirements of our Spiritual Mobilization. Second, we must strengthen the economic struggle to break the Japanese's greatest conspiracy. The Japanese's military aggression is weakening day by day, and its political conspiracy has long failed. What it is still vigorously carrying out is economic exploitation, which is the plunder and destruction of our country's various economies, and even more so the oppression and deception of our compatriots in the occupied areas. Regarding this point, our compatriots across the country must be particularly vigilant, and must be united as one, regardless of men, women, old or young, must strive to destroy the transportation of inferior goods, report smuggling, and resist sales. I hope even more that the compatriots in the war zone will especially practice the National Covenant. If you can implement one point of the National Covenant thoroughly, then the date of your liberation can be brought forward by one day. Everyone must encourage each other and never compromise under any circumstances. Four articles in the National Covenant are especially important. These four articles are the greatest weapon to control people's lives. We must know that if we buy one more inch of a Japanese match, and use one more Japanese counterfeit bill, it is to help the Japanese kill one more of our compatriots and occupy one more piece of our land. To achieve benevolence and take righteousness, and to be威武不屈, we must express the spirit of our nation on this point. Second, we must advocate work competitions to increase production and complete construction. The war of resistance has reached today, and it is no longer entirely a military issue, and the real work of national construction must start from now. Therefore, we must encourage the courage to move forward, and raise the energy of our compatriots across the country to the highest limit to improve our work efficiency. Whether we are fighting, administering, engaging in education and training, or striving for production and construction, whether in the war zone or in the rear, all central, local, county, district, township, village organs, schools, factories, and farms must vigorously implement work competitions, stipulate competition standards, agree on competition units, and see who does more, who does better, who does faster, who does more accurately, whose goods are better, whose prices are cheaper, who wastes the least, who produces the most refined products, and even who saves, who is thrifty, who is clean, who is neat, who is most disciplined, and who is most able to help each other. In this way, through continuous competition and continuous research, if there are shortcomings, we will help each other to correct them. If there are strengths, we will learn from each other and promote them. On the one hand, we will improve our personal work interests as much as possible, and at the same time, we will improve the common achievements of our collective work day by day. In this way, not only will the wartime strength be enriched, but also the habits of因循愆慢will be eliminated. Fourth, we must enrich the National Monthly Meeting so that everyone can participate enthusiastically and be more meaningful. The holding of the National Monthly Meeting must be widely promoted, but the content of the National Monthly Meeting must be enriched. We must use the National Monthly Meeting to promote wartime life, and at the same time, we must use the National Monthly Meeting to actively train the people and organize the people. We must make the National Monthly Meeting a kind of gathering that awakens the people to struggle, promotes mutual assistance among the people, eliminates bad habits, trains the spirit of autonomy, and promotes production undertakings. The government is now vigorously carrying out construction on the one hand, and is about to implement the new county system and establish local autonomy on the other hand. Therefore, we must integrate the work of the National Monthly Meeting with the work of local autonomy, and try our best to encourage the participating compatriots to report on the local events and discuss practical improvement issues, so as to become an effective organization to promote various constructions, rather than a ritual that follows the story. This is what the compatriots who lead the monthly meeting in various places should pay more attention to and make good use of. The above-mentioned items are all based on the experiences and observations of the past year, in order to encourage our national aspirations, invigorate our national spirit, and point out our compatriots with essential and easy-to-implement methods. Finally, I want to tell my compatriots across the country that the entire situation of the war of resistance and the entire world situation are all about to enter a period of transformation from adversity to prosperity. Victory and light are already in front of us, but we should be more persevering and more striving, and we must not have the slightest gap or the slightest懈怠, so that the Japanese have a懈可擊and a隙可乘. We must establish a strict spiritual barrier, hone our sharp spiritual weapons,扎硬寨, 打死仗, shed blood and sweat, rush to the front, and never do anything that is beneficial to the Japanese and harmful to the country. We must work hard to do everything that is beneficial to the country and helps the war of resistance. Everyone should painfully remember that it has been fifteen years since the Prime Minister died. Our revolution has not yet succeeded, and the Japanese are still stealing our territory. How sad and ashamed should we be? But thinking of the Prime Minister's Three Principles of the People, we have been led to the path of light and victory. How excited are we? Today, on the first anniversary of Spiritual Mobilization, is the time for us to examine ourselves and encourage ourselves. How much responsibility have I fulfilled to the country? Are my spirit and life suitable for the spirit and life of the people in wartime? I hope everyone will reflect on themselves, correct themselves in time, invigorate themselves in time, understand etiquette, know shame, take responsibility, abide by discipline,竭忠盡智, and strive forward to shoulder the solemn mission left to us by the Prime Minister to carry out the revolution, build the country, and seek freedom and equality for China.

### 15th Anniversary of the Death of the Prime Minister, 1st Anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization, Central Government Holds Joint Commemoration, Chairman Lin Reports on the Spot: Commemorating the Prime Minister by Implementing the General Mobilization of the Spirit Program

Chongqing. The 12th was the 15th anniversary of the death of the Prime Minister and the 1st anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization. The central government agencies jointly held a commemoration meeting. More than 600 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, heads of various departments and committees, and senior officials from party, government, and military agencies. It was led by Chairman Lin, and the ceremony was performed according to etiquette. He gave a report on the spot, titled (Commemorating the Prime Minister by Implementing the General Mobilization of the Spirit Program), roughly stating that today is the 15th anniversary of the death of the Prime Minister, and also the first anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization. When our war of resistance and national construction enters the third year, there are really many things to say to commemorate this day. We know that our Prime Minister, on the one hand, strived for the independence and freedom of the country throughout his life and laid the foundation for the country's复興. At the same time, he also created the profound Three Principles of the People as the supreme principle guiding the revolution. Looking at the Prime Minister's life, he is not only our country's revolutionary guide, but also the savior of all mankind. Therefore, the death of the Prime Minister cannot but be regarded as a major loss to our country and even the world. Fortunately, for more than ten years, comrades of our party and compatriots across the country have been united in sincerity and一致, under the leadership of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, the President of our party, in order to implement the Prime Minister's志, we have continued to struggle and finally overcome all obstacles, completed the unification of the country, achieved the work of安內, and embarked on the road of national rejuvenation. This is also our greatest achievement since the death of the Prime Minister, which is worthy of special commemoration. However, this achievement is envied by others, and they do not hesitate to create incidents and launch a major

### The Key to Negotiations Between Finland and the Soviet Union

Yesterday morning, it was widely rumored that the peace negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union would be revealed yesterday. I sincerely wish for a complete and satisfactory resolution. However, as of midnight when this reporter was writing, there was still no good news. What is somewhat comforting is that the negotiations between the two sides are still ongoing, with the chances of success and failure being about equal.

Whether Finland and the Soviet Union make peace or continue the war is a matter between the two countries, but its impact on the international situation and future is far-reaching and subtle. Broadly speaking, any other country views the Finnish-Soviet peace or war as closely related to their own well-being. Analytically speaking, Britain and France hope that Finland will resolutely resist, or at least not sacrifice or concede, and achieve a glorious peace; Germany hopes that the Soviet Union will quickly win the war, or at least achieve some minor gains and end the war with negotiations as soon as possible; Italy's wishes are similar to those of Britain and France; Japan hopes that the Soviet Union will continue the war and deplete itself limitlessly; the United States and China hope that a glorious and just peace will be established between Finland and the Soviet Union. Such analysis may not be readily endorsed by Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, but our pure objective observation and analysis lead to this impression. Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan have no ill will towards Finland, but each is acting in the best interests of their own country, and they wish that the Finnish-Soviet issue will trend in this direction.

The fact that Finland and the Soviet Union are currently negotiating and that the outcome is said to be half success and half failure is somewhat ambiguous. However, the content of the negotiations is not clear. Until the outcome of the negotiations is determined, who can predict it? Where does the key to peace or war lie? Some observers believe that Finland's peace or war depends on the extent of actual assistance from Britain and France, while others believe that British and French assistance depends on the convenience provided by Sweden and Norway, or on the Finnish Army Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim's grasp and attitude towards the future of the war. Each argument has its basis. Based on my experience with the Sino-Japanese issue, I understand the Finnish-Soviet issue. I feel that the world's opinions are somewhat uneasy. The world's view of China's resistance: those who are hostile to China say that China's resistance is due to the assistance of Britain and the United States; those who slander China say that China's resistance is due to the coercion of the Communist Party; those who are well-intentioned but alienated say that China's resistance is due to the advocacy of General Chiang Kai-shek; all of these are wrong. It is due to the Japanese invasion, the entire Chinese nation's pursuit of survival, China's potential to sustain long-term resistance, and the confidence to strive for final victory. Applying this to the Finnish-Soviet peace talks: the Finnish government and people, and the Finnish military and civilians, are as loyal and brave as the Chinese; unfortunately, they are not blessed with favorable natural conditions, so objectively, they cannot sustain long-term resistance; subjectively, they openly express their need for assistance and lack the confidence to strive for final victory on their own; even with General Mannerheim's loyalty, integrity, wisdom, and courage, he can only say that if they cannot maintain the independence and freedom of the nation, they would rather fight to the last old man, woman, and child; this is limited and helpless, and not due to poor human planning. Where does the key to peace or war lie? It lies in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet nation has its unique and unyielding qualities. It can do whatever it wants, but there are things it will not do. It has its beliefs, but it can also assess the situation, give up unnecessary persistence. There are many examples, so I will not explain them in detail. Just taking Finland as an example: in military terms, it braved the difficulties of weather and terrain and made an attempt to penetrate and destroy. It encountered resistance, and its sharp edge was repeatedly blunted. Superficial people ridiculed it for being weak, but its absolute advantage is recognized by all knowledgeable people; if it were to unleash its majestic power, it would eventually control the entire territory of Finland; even if it were inevitably unsuccessful; it is now initiating peace talks without insisting on its military victory. This shows that it is not weak, so it does not lose its glory. In political terms, it initially fell into vain propaganda due to confusion, and was deceived by fellow travelers, thinking that one person could start a rebellion, widely call for support, and easily change the flag; later, knowing that this was not the case, it could not use military force as a backing to support it and complete it, using it as a tool, which it could value or despise today, and give or take as it pleased in the future; but now it is initiating peace talks and still treating the current Finnish government as its counterpart, without letting this transformation harm its so-called image. This is because it can release and收, without being bogged down or stagnant. The Soviet Union has the confidence to establish a nation, control policies autonomously, and knows that the root of its so-called image lies not in this, so it can abandon a puppet without harming its image. Only because the Soviet Union is like this, the question is whether the Soviet Union will disregard time and sacrifice, and eventually destroy Finland with military force? Or will it present Finland with acceptable conditions, so that Finland can still be an independent and free country, and from then on turn swords into plowshares. Will peace be realized then? On the issue of territory, Finland must be prepared to adapt to the wishes of the Soviet Union, without hindering its own survival, and make appropriate concessions; on the issue of sovereignty, it must maintain the integrity of its independence and freedom within its borders and never compromise. The establishment of a nation depends on the integrity of sovereignty as an absolute condition, while the size of territory is a relative phenomenon; loyal strategists seek complete security, and secondly, they would rather cede local territory than give up even a little bit of sovereignty. Giving up sovereignty means losing the nation; those who intend to destroy another nation must use violence to control the overall situation, and if they cannot avoid it, they will seek to control sovereignty without seeking territory. In short: the content of the Finnish-Soviet negotiations is unknown, and the success or failure of the future is unknown; what can be inferred is that the standard for whether Finland accepts the Soviet conditions is very simple, depending on whether the cession of land hinders its survival? Whether independence and freedom are preserved. What is unknown is: what are the Soviet conditions? Therefore, it is said that the key lies in the Soviet Union. The success or failure of the Finnish-Soviet negotiations is the key to peace or war between the two countries; peace or war between the two countries is the key to whether the European chaos expands or not, and whether the world situation gradually becomes stable or increasingly dangerous. The military aggression on a large scale. In order to survive, we are forced to resist. Therefore, as long as the aggression does not stop for a day, our resistance will not stop for a day. There is no room for hesitation in this. In short, the life of our Premier is to strive for the freedom and equality of the country. Therefore, we must continue to strive for the independence and freedom of our country until we can get it for a day. And our current resistance is to inherit the legacy of the Premier and complete the great cause of national independence and freedom. Therefore, only by resisting to the end can we be considered as believers of the Premier, and only then can we fulfill the significance of commemorating the Premier in the future. Our resistance is almost full two years, others are getting weaker and weaker as they fight, but we are getting stronger and stronger as we fight. Judging from the combat situation in the most recent year, their military offensive is hopeless. Now they can only intensify their political offensive and engage in the manufacture of puppet organizations to deceive their people. But in fact, apart from a few who are willing to be driven by them, I believe that all our loyal soldiers and civilians across the country will be able to see through their cunning schemes, strengthen unity, and jointly smash their ambitions and strive for final victory. Therefore, their attempt only reflects their hopelessness and will never damage us. Today, when we commemorate the Premier here, it is also the anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization. All of the Premier's instructions are the highest guiding principles for our resistance and nation-building, and what is stipulated in the National Spiritual Mobilization outline is based on the Premier's instructions to complete the important events of resistance and nation-building. In order to strive for final victory, in addition to恪遵the Premier's instructions, we must also practice the spiritual mobilization outline, especially the three goals in the outline, which must be achieved, because these three goals can be said to be the highest principles of all our future efforts. If we can貫澈 these three quantities of high principles, not only can the final victory be mastered, but also the great cause of nation-building and rejuvenation can be accelerated. (12th telegram)

(12th telegram)

### Sun Ke Advocates Close Cooperation with the Soviet Union

Chongqing, today is the memorial day of the Premier's death. Sun Ke, the son of Sun Yat-sen and the current President of the Legislative Yuan, delivered a speech, stating that it is absolutely necessary for the Chinese government to maintain close cooperation with the Soviet Union. According to Sun, the success of the Soviet Union's construction today can represent the realization of the Premier's Three Principles of the People, because the Soviet Union's construction expresses the ideals of nationalism, democracy, and socialism. Therefore, the more we admire the Soviet Union, the more we should believe in the Three Principles of the People, and the more we believe in the Three Principles of the People, the more we should study the Soviet Union and cooperate with the Soviet Union. He also said that there are more than 100 ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union, but their rights are all equal. Each ethnic group can preserve its inherent language and culture. The Premier's demand for nationalism lies in this. He also said that since the promulgation of the Stalin Constitution, the Soviet Union has become the most democratic country in the world. The Soviet Union's two and a half five-year plans have industrialized the entire country, and at the same time have made a reasonable solution to the distribution problem. Finally, Sun said that the Premier's theory is to liberate Taiwan, Korea, and all nations that are currently oppressed by Japan. (Associated Press, 12th telegram)

### Publication of the Premier's Pro-Soviet Testament

Chongqing, Sun Ke, President of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, released a letter from his father to the Soviet Communist Party on the 15th anniversary of the death of the Premier. The letter said, "I am now leaving the Kuomintang to my successors. I hope that the Kuomintang can cooperate with you to complete the historical task of liberating China from the shackles of imperialism. I have ordered the Kuomintang to join hands with you forever. I firmly believe that you will be able to help us in the future as you have done in the past. I deeply believe that if China and the Soviet Union can unite as one, they will surely be able to achieve the mission of liberating the oppressed nations of the world." At the same time, the All-Russian Communist Party and the Presidium of the Soviet Union also sent a telegram to China today, expressing their condolences for the death of Sun Yat-sen, and said, "The Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Communist Party firmly believes that the Kuomintang, under the glorious banner of Sun Yat-senism, will be able to completely defeat the imperialists and their agents in this struggle." (Associated Press, 12th telegram)

### Chinese Army Recaptures Several Strongholds Near Datang, Heavy Casualties for the Japanese Army in Night Attacks, Remnants of the Japanese Army Being Besieged in Jieyang East

Meixian, the Japanese army, which has been restless in the Chaoshan area recently, has been intercepted by the Chinese army on one side, and flanked by mobile units on both sides. In the past three days, Japanese corpses have been found all over the valleys. The Japanese army, which invaded from Chaozhou, was blocked by the Chinese army in the Dalingtou area of Longxiangzhai. Although the Japanese launched repeated attacks, they were all repelled. The Japanese army, which invaded north from Fuyang, attempted to meet with the Japanese who invaded Chaozhou in Guxiang. They were flanked by the Chinese army in Fu'gang, Fengtang, and other places, and suffered heavy losses. They are still confronting each other in the area. The Japanese army, which invaded west towards Sangpu Mountain, attacked the Baotai City area. The Chinese mobile unit launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army on the 10th, killing many Japanese soldiers. They have now surrounded the area and are痛殱ing them. (12th telegram)

### Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee: Diet Members Question Various Diplomatic Cases

Tokyo, 12th - The House of Representatives Budget Committee convened at 10:30 AM today, with diet members posing questions and answers regarding the following issues:

North China Development Problem

Mr. Kunio Morishita (Minseito) inquired about the progress since the establishment of the North China Development Company. Mr. Takao, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Asian Development Board, replied that the North China Development Company was capitalized by Japan in cash or in kind. The company acts as a central entity comprehensively controlling national policy business companies. The telecommunications company, North China Transportation Company, and mining company, among others, under its control, are each responsible for developing resources. This year, subsidiary companies will begin developing the Datong coal mine, and recently the North China Electric Power Company was established to operate the electricity business. While the coal mines in North China are currently under the control of the Japanese army, consideration is being given to incorporating them into the Development Company for operation in the future.

Japan-Soviet Fisheries Problem

Mr. Ichiro Kono (Seiyukai Kuhara faction) inquired about the truth of reports that Japan's fishing grounds had been seized by the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Arita replied that the stable and special fishing areas are still operated by Japan. As for other fishing areas, those that have reached their expiration dates are subject to annual bidding between Japan and the Soviet Union. Three of these fishing areas have been won by the Soviet side. However, if these areas were obtained through Soviet pressure or unfair bidding, Japan will lodge a protest.

Tianjin Problem

Mr. Kunio Morishita inquired about the content of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations regarding the Tianjin problem. The Foreign Minister replied that an agreement had been reached on the issue of public security, but that opinions on economic issues remain divided and are still under negotiation. However, he stated that he could not disclose the details. He added that the situation has changed considerably since the meetings last year, and this point is also being taken into consideration in the negotiations.

Bangkok Maru Incident

Mr. Oda asked what measures the government is taking in response to the Annam authorities' inspection of the Osaka Shosen Bangkok Maru in Haiphong and the confiscation of mail. The Foreign Minister replied that international law recognizes the right of belligerent nations to seize enemy documents unfavorable to them on neutral ships docked in their ports. However, while it is necessary to seize mail harmful to the country, harmless mail should not be confiscated. The government has instructed the authorities stationed in Annam to ensure that the country adheres to this principle.

Shanghai Postal Problem

Mr. Seizo Mogami (Minseito) inquired about the actual situation regarding postal supervision in Shanghai and North China. The Foreign Minister replied that postal supervision in the Shanghai and North China areas is being carried out by the military authorities and others, with the expectation that the postal service will not be used for espionage. Economic Minister Takao stated that the restoration of postal services is extremely necessary, and that recovery is gradually taking place in various locations in North and Central China since the outbreak of the incident. Furthermore, military postal services, the use of Japanese military scrip, and the preservation of the secrecy of correspondence are also proceeding smoothly.

U.S. Loan to China

Mr. Oda inquired about rumors that the U.S. government was considering approving a $20 million loan to the Chiang Kai-shek government, and asked the Foreign Minister for his opinion on this. Foreign Minister Arita replied that the U.S. had already approved a $20 million loan to Finland to promote exports. The proposed $20 million loan to China is primarily intended to stimulate U.S. exports and is not to be used for the export of military supplies, etc. However, the U.S. government's actions to assist Chiang Kai-shek are viewed with displeasure by Japan.

Japan-U.S. Trade Treaty

Mr. Oda inquired about the policy towards the United States after the abrogation of the Japan-U.S. trade treaty. Foreign Minister Arita replied that Japan hopes the United States will allow unobstructed trade and commerce, and hopes that the United States will adopt the same attitude. Mr. Oda inquired whether the United States, based on the Nine-Power Treaty, would convene a Nine-Power Conference to pressure Japan. He further added that Undersecretary Welles' mediation of peace in the European war fully demonstrates the U.S.'s policy of encirclement toward Japan. Foreign Minister Arita replied that he had not yet received information about the rumored Nine-Power Conference. He pointed out that a Nine-Power Conference had already been held before the incident, and Mr. Oda should be aware of the Japanese government's attitude toward it. Furthermore, he stated that he did not believe the United States intended to adopt a policy of encirclement against Japan. (12th, Domei News Agency)

Extraterritoriality Problem

Tokyo - Foreign Minister Arita stated in the House of Representatives today in response to questioning that Japan is prepared to relinquish extraterritorial rights in China but cannot do so "immediately upon or after the establishment of a new Chinese regime" because considerable preparation is necessary. The Japanese government hopes to relinquish extraterritorial rights as quickly as possible when the current situation permits. (12th, Reuters)

Anglo-Japanese Negotiations

Tokyo - During the House of Representatives meeting this afternoon, considerable attention was paid to reports that Britain had intercepted contraband in the Japanese Sea. One diet member questioned whether a Japanese ferry traveling between Busan, Korea, and Shimonoseki had been stopped by a British warship and boarded for inspection. Foreign Minister Arita replied that he had not received any such information. Another diet member inquired about the twelve German nationals being held in Hong Kong after the Asama Maru incident. The Foreign Minister replied that the government is continuing negotiations with the British government for their extradition, but that it is not yet the appropriate time to release any information about the progress of the negotiations. (12th, Reuters)

### Yonai to Reiterate Attitude Toward Wang; Abe May Visit China

### Second Supplementary Budget to be Submitted to Cabinet on the 14th

Tokyo - The Japanese government has scheduled a cabinet meeting on the 14th of this month to decide on the second supplementary budget for the Showa 15 fiscal year. This budget is expected to cover emergency measures for last year's drought, increased coal production, and merit-based rewards, totaling approximately 500 million yen. Until now, the budgets submitted to the Diet have all followed cabinet policy, but this supplementary budget is based on the current cabinet's independent policies and is therefore noteworthy. (12th, Domei News Agency)

### Japanese Suspicions About U.S. Attitude

Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun published an article this morning stating that the United States' policy toward Japan remains deeply unpleasant, citing the U.S. government's approval of a $20 million loan to China and Secretary of State Hull's consultation with 55 countries about the postwar world order, excluding Japan, as evidence. The Asahi Shimbun further stated that a related important issue is the U.S. government's denial of the establishment of a new central government in China. A faction in the United States believes that if such a new regime is established, the United States should convene a Nine-Power Conference to take active measures to deny this new situation. Should the United States take this action, Britain and France would support the United States. Therefore, Japan is maintaining calm while closely monitoring the future attitude and actions of the United States. (12th, Reuters)

### British Straits Settlements Iron Ore Exports to Japan Questioned in British House of Commons

London - During today's session of the House of Commons, opposition Labour MP Edward inquired of the Colonial Office authorities how much iron ore from the British Straits Settlements had been sold to Japan in the twelve months before the outbreak of the war and since the outbreak of the war. The reply stated that between October 1938 and October 1939, a total of 1,862,612 tons of iron ore had been shipped from the Straits Settlements to Japan, but that the government has received no reports since October 1939. Edward further asked whether this large amount of iron ore being shipped to Japan was in the interests of the country. The Colonial Office authorities did not respond. (11th, Havas)

### Japanese Labor Shortage

Tokyo (Air Mail) - At yesterday's session of the House of Representatives, Planning Board President Takeuchi replied to an inquiry from a diet member that, according to assessments for the current fiscal year, there is a 20% shortage of labor nationwide.

The government is considering recruiting Koreans and increasing the number of female workers domestically to fill the shortfall. (Havas)

### No Real Possibility of Closer Ties Between Soviet Union and Japan; Japanese Propaganda Aimed at Promoting Cooperation with Britain and the United States

Washington - Despite the Japanese Foreign Ministry's statement yesterday regarding the resolution of disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan, government officials in contact with the [Washington] sources all believed last night that no large-scale rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan is possible. Observers here claim that the intention of the Japanese statement is to promote cooperation between Britain and the United States, threatening both countries with Japanese-Soviet cooperation. It is widely believed that Japan is attempting to use this threat to get the United States to recognize Japan's conquest of China, relax its embargo on Japan, and begin negotiations on a new Japanese-U.S. trade treaty. It is said that Tokyo hopes to use the threat of a Japanese-Soviet rapprochement to make Britain more willing to make concessions to Japan. Officials here also claim that private sources from within China have reported that Chiang Kai-shek will continue to receive significant assistance from the Soviet Union. They believe that the only possible way for Japan to end such assistance from the Soviet Union would be to offer the Soviet Union significant concessions. It is generally pointed out that Soviet-Japanese rivalry is not only ideological, but also historical and geographical. The conclusion of a trade treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan is not impossible, but that treaty is unlikely to include any conditions under which the Soviet Union would cease its aid to the Nationalist government, or any major concessions by the Soviet Union to Japan. Officials here indicated that the evidence cited in the Japanese Foreign Ministry statement for improvements in Japanese-Soviet relations are minor. The only noteworthy issue is the possibility of the Soviet Union concluding some kind of alliance with Japan, as the Soviet Union, when the Allies are at war, is deeply concerned about Japan attacking its rear. Therefore, the Soviet Union may want to keep Japan neutral. According to a statement released yesterday by a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the resolution of Japanese-Soviet problems is "making great strides," and discussions on issues such as the border of "Manchukuo," fishing rights, gasoline, and coal are improving. These negotiations are ongoing. The spokesperson stated, "General relations are improving. What must currently be emphasized is that definite and concrete results have not yet been obtained." (12th, United Press)

### U.S. Boxer Commits Murder

### Results of Soviet Far East Fisheries Auctions: Most Areas Awarded to the Soviet Union

### Finnish Delegation in Moscow Continues Peace Negotiations; Reportedly, Soviet Conditions Slightly Eased; Finnish Acceptance Subject to Parliamentary Vote

Helsinki - After Finnish state representatives spoke again in Moscow at 2:00PM today with Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Molotov, it was said by informed sources that current Finnish-Soviet negotiations had not established any agreements or reached any decisions. The momentum for peace or war remains unresolved. Cabinet members and parliamentarians from both houses have maintained close contact with their representatives since the start of negotiations. According to political circles here, the three most delicate issues in the current negotiations are: (1) the building of a railway from the port of Viipuri northeastward directly to the Soviet border; (2) the political and military system of Finland after the war; (3) the Hanko Peninsula issue.

In addition, Prime Minister Ryti's presence in Moscow since the 7th of this month has only just been known to the Finnish people this morning, which has been perceived as strange. It is commonly said that although negotiations are in progress, frontline battles and the arbitrary bombing by Soviet aircraft continue as before, which is especially baffling. (11th, Havas)

Stockholm - Regarding the peace talks between Finland and the Soviet Union, various newspapers here recently reported that the Soviet Union originally demanded that Finland cede the port of Petsamo, the Hanko Peninsula, and the port of Viipuri. It is now rumored that they are prepared to abandon this demand, and only require Finland to cede to the Soviet Union the areas occupied by the Red Army in the Karelian Isthmus and the Audru Island. (12th, Havas)

London - Regarding the peace talks between the Soviet Union and Finland, financial circles here generally believe that Finland may not make any decisions for several hours. This is because the conditions proposed by the Soviet Union must first be accepted by the Finnish cabinet, and then approved by parliament, before they can be considered accepted by the entire Finnish nation. Furthermore, General Mannerheim, commander-in-chief of the country's army, knows best whether the country can continue to resist. His opinion is also a force to be reckoned with. (12th, Havas)

Paris - Diplomatic circles here recently stated that the peace terms proposed by the Soviet government to Finland seem to have been substantially reduced. The intention behind this is to conclude an agreement with the country as soon as possible. The reasons for this are as follows: (1) Leningrad is very close to the war zone, and residents in the area are very aware of the war situation. It is feared that they may not be able to maintain their high morale for long; (2) Britain and France have a real possibility of actively intervening in the Finnish-Soviet war. This is clearly demonstrated by British Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons today that if Finland applies for aid, Britain and France will continue to provide assistance regardless of the attitudes of other countries. Not only that, but the Soviet Union has failed to achieve a swift victory since using troops against Finland, and its position vis-à-vis Germany has been greatly weakened. In order to salvage its technical and industrial resources, it had to sign a cooperation agreement with Germany, authorizing the country to organize, control, and oversee Soviet production. In reality, the Soviet authorities may not welcome this agreement, which will soon become apparent. In addition, although Germany voluntarily abandoned its position in the Baltic coastal states last September and October, it has recently sought to restore it, given the Red Army's long and unsuccessful campaign. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky recently contacted the British Foreign Office authorities, hoping that Britain would mediate the war between Finland and the Soviet Union. This move is of great significance, as it shows that the Soviet Union is unwilling to ask Germany to mediate due to fears of paying too high a price. Political circles also say that, given the news today that the Soviet conditions for Finland are far more lenient than those proposed before the outbreak of the war, the country's desire to quickly conclude a peace is already obvious.

According to news from the Scandinavian peninsula, the Soviet Union no longer insists on Finland ceding the port of Viipuri, but only requests that the two sides demarcate a new border. In other words, the border will be extended from Lake Ladoga, through the Mannerheim Line, to the city of Vuoksi, and then follow the line currently occupied by the Red Army to a point between the Finnish city of Summa and the port of Viipuri. As such, a portion of the Mannerheim Line may still belong to Finland. Furthermore, it is reported that the Soviet Union's demands for the ports of Petsamo in northern Finland and the Hanko Peninsula in the south have also been eased compared to before. (11th, Havas)

### Finnish Parliament Meets Through the Night

Helsinki - After meeting for several hours last night, the Finnish Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee immediately convened a plenary session of Parliament, which had not adjourned by midnight. Members of all political parties and representatives of the General Staff participated in the meeting, which was held not in Helsinki but in "a secret location" under strict protection. (12th, Huitong Telegraph)

### Britain Sent Note to Finland Offering All Possible Assistance; Prime Minister Chamberlain Responded to Diet Member Questions, Stating Assistance to Finland Will Not Violate Treaties

London - Reuters has learned that the British Prime Minister Chamberlain has, on multiple occasions, sent Finland notes stating all possible assistance. This note arrived in Helsinki before the Finnish delegation departed for Moscow to discuss peace terms. This morning, responsible officials stated that no reply has been received from the Finnish government regarding this matter. According to London, the Finnish delegation is still in Moscow. (12th, Reuters)

London - During this afternoon's meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chamberlain commented on the Finnish issue, stating that "Any assistance that we provide to Finland must be consistent with the obligations we have accepted under the Covenant of the League of Nations. This is certain." Opposition Labour MP Kirkwood interjected, "Isn't what we're doing no different from fighting the Soviet Union?" The Prime Minister replied, "As of now, it has not reached that point." Opposition Labour MP Sloan asked, "Is the British government prepared to send troops to Finland and violate Norwegian neutrality?" The Prime Minister replied, "Regarding this, I have already made a statement, and there is nothing more to add." He then replied to an inquiry from Opposition Labour leader Major Attlee, saying, "Regarding the current situation between the Soviet Union and Finland, I have no reliable information to share with you at this time. The rumor that the Soviet Union has requested Britain to mediate is not entirely accurate, but Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has presented several conditions to Foreign Secretary Halifax, requesting that the British government convey them to Finland. The government believed it was inappropriate to do so, and that is the real situation." (11th, Havas)

### U.S. Not Involved in Soviet-Finnish Negotiations; Hull Issues Statement, Only Observes

Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt has been in contact with Soviet officials and the Finnish delegation in Moscow, but has not been mediating the Soviet-Finnish conflict. The purpose of the Ambassador's actions is to ensure that the United States fully understands the progress of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. Steinhardt and the U.S. government have not engaged in or interfered in the negotiations between the two countries. He has not received any news that representatives from the two countries are holding negotiations at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Officials here believe that the above news may be due to Steinhardt's important role in the Moscow mediation movement. (12th, United Press)

Washington - The White House press briefing yesterday was not attended by President Roosevelt due to a slight cold. The President's Secretary, O'Leary, took an evasive stance when answering questions about the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. He stated that he had announced last week that the United States was in a position of observer regarding the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, and that there were no new developments. O'Leary went on to say that the State Department is the agency responsible for answering this question. The State Department also remained silent yesterday, but U.S. newspapers reported that the location of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations was the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union. Political figures here also believe that Britain's activities are actually more active than officially acknowledged, but the State Department only stated that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt was not involved in the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. The press here anticipates that the U.S. government will issue a statement soon. (12th, Huitong Telegraph)

### Sweden Reiterates Policy to Ensure Neutrality; Seeks Only Swedish-Finnish Common Interests; Has Had No Contact with Germany

Stockholm - Swedish Foreign Minister Gunther met with a Reuters reporter last night and denied that Sweden had issued any advice to Finland. He stated that Sweden had had no contact with Germany during these negotiations and had not advised the Finnish government in any way. When asked if there was a possibility of Sweden providing guarantees for Finland if peace could be achieved, Gunther replied that this issue had not yet arisen. Gunther continued to describe Anglo-Swedish relations, saying that they have always been extremely cordial and remain so to this day. He hopes that they will remain unchanged in the future. Sweden is very surprised by the misunderstandings and distortions of Swedish policy overseas. Sweden's goal is to do its utmost to serve the interests of both Finland and Sweden. The situation has shown us that the best way to help Finland is to maintain our neutrality and do our best to supply necessary materials and volunteers. When asked if Sweden had considered preventing its iron ore from being transported to belligerent countries in order to ensure its neutrality, Gunther replied that such a move would likely have the opposite effect. Sweden's best guarantee is to continue normal trade with all parties. (12th, Reuters)

Stockholm - Today's conservative "Dagens Nyheter" reported that if Finland rejects the Soviet conditions, Sweden will begin a Spanish-style "non-intervention" and send complete units, to which Germany will likely not object. We must make it clear to the Western European powers that their intervention will not be tolerated by Sweden or Norway. We do not want Scandinavia and Finland to become a battlefield for Allied conflict in the north. If Finland rejects the Soviet demands, the Swedish government will immediately change, allowing more military personnel to participate, as only the leaders of national defense can make the necessary decisions. (12th, Reuters)

Bombay: The Indian National Congress plans to convene an important meeting, hoping to decide whether the party should allow cooperation with Britain in the current war against Germany, or insist on first granting India independence before allowing cooperation. Final preparations for the meeting are now nearing completion. The meeting is nominally only "an ordinary routine annual meeting" and will be held in Lanjiahe, in the province of Rajputana in northwestern India, and will open on Friday, March 15. The most important event of the discussion is that the British government must only allow India dominion status after the end of the war. The outcome of the meeting is absolutely unpredictable. The leaders of the party are now maintaining strict silence, but it is an open secret that Gandhi is at least willing to avoid any irreparable split with the British authorities. According to all sources, the meeting will form a struggle between conservatives and the extreme left-wing leaders in the party, and Gandhi will try to balance the two factions and prevent either from being overthrown. The conservatives believe that if the Congress Party makes excessive demands, it will only harm itself and gain nothing. If they are open and honest, they may gain something. Rather than risk losing everything by being too greedy, it is better to ensure that they can gain a little. They regard themselves as realists. A newspaper in this area, which has long been regarded as the mouthpiece of this faction, recently published an article that did not focus on independence, but stated that the Congress Party is eager to achieve political progress. Many believe that Gandhi is in favor of this reasonable approach. The left wing, led by Nehru, strongly opposes this view. It is said that the party believes that now is not the time for the Congress Party to completely submit. Nehru once declared that what the Congress Party demands is a clearly defined status, which is independence. It is wrong to believe that Gandhi or anyone else would advocate anything less than this. Nehru also made intimidating remarks, saying that the young people of Western countries are now dying in droves to deal with their problems, and that India is now prepared to face that hell in order to solve its own problems. Between the two factions, there is a relatively powerful central group that advocates demanding only nominal independence for India now. The leader of this faction told a Reuters reporter that this is close to idealizing India, which will not break away from Britain, but should be allowed the right to break away in order to appease our extremists. Whatever changes may occur in the future, we should avoid doing anything at this stage that is considered to compromise with British imperialism. Muslim leaders, who are responsible for their 90 million co-religionists, are becoming increasingly uneasy. Their most urgent concern is that whatever final decision is made regarding India's status now, it must have adequate provisions so as to not place Muslims under the control of the Congress Party, as the Congress Party is nothing more than an Indian-Hindu group. Jinnah, Chairman of the All-India Muslim League, recently told visitors in a near-grieving tone that we Muslims are prepared to put forward concrete proposals for the future constitution of India to replace abstraction, but the Governor-General or the British government has not expressed this desire. The two are now clearly busy persuading Gandhi to descend from idealism to realism, so they have no time to care about Muslims. However, I must emphatically declare that Muslim India can never agree to its future being decided by the Gandhi faction, nor can it accept the final decision of Great Britain. We must eventually appeal to the one and only judge that we consider to be the best. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)

### Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Schools Increase Tuition Fees under the Pretext of Complying with New Regulations. The Most Common Increase is 20 Percent. Poor Students Find it Difficult to Cope and are Forced to Drop Out

(Hong Kong Correspondence) Many Overseas Chinese schools here find it difficult to comply with the new education regulations promulgated by the Hong Kong government. They recently jointly requested the education authorities to make improvements. They are now preparing to petition Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote. The petition is still being drafted. However, while this move is actively underway, most Overseas Chinese schools have increased their tuition fees.

Poor Students Forced to Drop Out

According to investigations, the most schools increasing tuition fees are in Hong Kong. Apart from some larger schools, such as Fang Lin, Hong Kong Overseas Chinese, Southwest, Guanghua, Lingdao, Zhixing, South China, and Meifang, the smaller ones have all increased their tuition fees. For example, at a large girls' secondary school kindergarten on Caine Road, tuition fees for one semester have increased from $18 to $22. Primary schools charge fees according to grades 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6, with increases of $2 in each case. For junior high and senior high, the former increases from $32 to $36, and the latter from $36 to $40. Smaller schools mostly increase tuition fees by $10 per year, that is, $5 per semester. In general, the most common increase is 20 percent. Some schools, which in the past widely recruited students or gave preferential treatment to the poor, often set up half-fee student places. Now, it has been found that these schools have cancelled the preferential treatment originally enjoyed by half-fee students and require full fees to be paid. Otherwise, they must drop out. Since these students are poor, they find it difficult to cope for a while, and many are forced to drop out. In addition, some schools did not state that they would increase tuition fees when students registered. It was only when paying the fees that they learned that the school had raised tuition fees. Parents are mostly dissatisfied with this.

Tuition Fees Increased Despite Simple Equipment

Overseas Chinese school tuition fees are mostly not uniform, but the amount of fees charged depends on the size of the school. Schools with simple equipment naturally charge less than those with more substantial facilities. However, at present, the fees charged by these schools with simple equipment are equal to those of better schools, and those who want to transfer are unable to do so because all schools are full. They are forced to continue studying at their old schools.

Other Reasons for Increasing Tuition Fees

According to reporter investigations, the reason for increasing tuition fees at Overseas Chinese schools is the excuse of the new education regulations promulgated in Hong Kong, which require schools to make many reforms and increase their burden. Therefore, tuition fees are increased to make up for it. Another reason is the increase in rent. However, according to the reporter's inquiry with several leaders in the education sector in Hong Kong, it was learned that the new education regulations recently promulgated by the Hong Kong government have not yet caused schools to suddenly increase their burden. In fact, the education authorities have not strictly implemented the new regulations. If schools use this as an excuse to increase tuition fees, it seems inappropriate to increase the burden of education fees on Overseas Chinese. Moreover, the outcome of the request to the Hong Kong government to improve the new regulations is still unknown. It would be premature to suddenly increase tuition fees at this time.

### Middle School Student Life Guidance (Part 1)

— Wang Maozu

(Kunming Correspondence) Mr. Dian Cuncun, who studied abroad and returned to China, has served as a professor at famous universities in China and the principal of provincial middle schools for many years, and is currently the director of a branch of the Central Political School, recently wrote an article on "Middle School Student Life Guidance," in which he made earnest instructions on the selection of middle school student life guidance personnel, psychological characteristics, and guidance methods, etc., which are of great value. Therefore, I have specially recorded the original text as follows: The middle school students of today will be the backbone of rebuilding the country and the nation in the near future. According to education statistics from five years ago, middle school students in our country account for 12 out of every 10,000 people in the country. After deducting those who drop out midway, I am afraid that it is less than one in a thousand. In other words, each middle school student has to shoulder the responsibility of leading 1,000 people. Of course, there are also university students above them, but university and college students must also come from middle schools. Therefore, the guidance of middle school students is related to the lifeline of the country, and it is extremely important. Since the War of Resistance, organizations such as the Three People's Principles Youth League have taken middle school students as their main target. Spiritual mobilization also relies on the service of the Youth League as the backbone of promotion. It is hoped that on this arduous journey of resisting the war and building the country, a large number of healthy, brave, and enterprising new youth will be produced to create a new life for the nation. What is described in this article is limited to life guidance within middle schools.

First, the selection of instructors

Life guidance in middle schools should of course be undertaken by teachers, with the tutor as the central person in charge. The selection of tutors should first be those who firmly believe in the Three People's Principles and have correct political views, second, those who are willing to be considerate of young people and study the emotions of young people, and third, those who teach homework and can gain the belief of students, often able to enlighten students with good suggestions and correct understanding, and fourth, in short, those who can lead by example, are not afraid of being tedious, and have a sincere, enthusiastic, and contagious attitude. If all four of the above items can be fully prepared, it can be said that they are the best teachers in the country.

Second, the characteristics of psychological development of middle school students

Since the object of guidance specified in this topic is middle school students, then we must first have a review and research on the physical and mental development of middle school students as the basis for guidance methods. Middle school students range in age from twelve or thirteen to twenty years old, with a large difference among them. High school and junior high school student activities must be guided separately due to differences in experience level and stage of physiological development. However, the concentrated trend of its development is the period of adolescence, and drastic changes have taken place in the body and spirit. What kind of personality to develop is at this juncture. Generally speaking, their psychological characteristics are: (1) A flourishing of emotions. The life of the adolescent period can be said to be the life of emotion. Although the intellectual aspect is also very advanced, it is often obscured by emotional impulses. Their sympathy is extremely developed, loyal to the group, loving to the weak, worshiping heroes, loving to fight injustice, and loving to be praised. Because emotions are too strong, they are very enthusiastic when they encounter things of interest, and after hitting a wall, they will be depressed and frustrated. If they get inappropriate comfort or relief, the strong tend to go astray, and the weak become numb and decadent, which must be carefully considered. (2) "Active ideals." Their understanding of the objective world is certainly insufficient, but their impulse to seek knowledge is extremely strong, and they imagine and test everything at the same time, forming various ideals in their minds. Behind this, emotions are active. In the real world, life is full of contradictions and is restricted. The nature of ideals in adolescence is extremely fluid and active. Coupled with the strength of curiosity, they can follow the wind after hearing an inspiring speech. As for sacrificing their lives, or getting suggestions from novels, they can indulge in confusion and live that wandering life. In the past, there were young people who wrote after reading "Dream of the Red Chamber." A few years ago, newspapers reported the fact that three or several middle school students went to Kunlun Mountain to practice Taoism together. It can be said that the life of adolescence is rich in literary and religious qualities. (3) "Group formation and hostility." Young people like small groups, such as "Brotherhood," "Ten Sisters," etc., and are hostile and competitive with other groups. Based on this point, the training of British middle school ball fields can cultivate fair competition and political morality. If it is used for other purposes, it will become a tool of political struggle. We should expand this concept of small unity into a large unity and guide the competitive behavior of hostility to cooperative competition. Also, young people like to show off and love to wear tall hats, which can prove the development of self-awareness. Because they are inexperienced, they do not consider the advantages and disadvantages of doing things, and often go beyond the norms, so they should be given appropriate restrictions from time to time during agitation. (4) "Tendency to commit crimes." Since young people's emotional impulses and their remaining energy are very strong, if there is no appropriate opportunity to vent and release them, they will feel depressed and seek ways to satisfy themselves, and they will rush out. In some incidents, the motive is not bad, but because they do not know how to deal with it, they have committed illegal acts. In the United Kingdom and the United States, there are juvenile courts to carry out rehabilitation.

### The Cultural World Yesterday Mourned Zhuang Baiyu, Who Compiled China's First Elementary School Textbook

Mr. Zhuang Baiyu of Wujin was an advanced figure in China's education world. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of Emperor Dezong (1905), he established Guanying Elementary School and Youyou Girls' School in Wujin. The following year, he operated Shanggong Elementary School in this city. At that time, people were unenlightened. Mr. Zhuang, together with wise men, founded speech clubs, book reading clubs, anti-foot-binding societies, and private school reform societies, calling out and running around to enlighten the people. Later, he served as an editor at the Commercial Press and held important positions in the China Vocational Education Society and the Jiangsu Education Association. China's first elementary school Chinese textbook was also compiled by Mr. Zhuang in cooperation with Jiang Zhuzhuang, Zhang Jusheng, and Gao Mengqie (i.e., the Latest Chinese Textbook). He also compiled Simplified Textbooks and Republican Textbooks. Recently, Mr. Zhuang died of a chronic illness in Shanghai at the age of 62. People from the cultural and educational circles of this city held a memorial service at Lake Society at 2:30 pm yesterday. More than 300 people from all walks of life, the Commercial Press, including Jiang Zhuzhuang, Lu Gaoyi, Xu Jiqi, and others attended. The layout of the auditorium was very solemn and solemn. A portrait of Mr. Zhuang was hung in the center, and there were many elegiac couplets and white banners presented by relatives and friends. Mr. Li, the deputy manager of the Commercial Press, presided over the sacrifice. Jiang Zhuzhuang reported on his life deeds, and Pan Wen'an, Huang Jingwan, and others gave speeches one after another.

### Second Middle Vocational Supplementary Free Class

The Second China Vocational Supplementary School, located at 330 Beijing Road, recently, in view of the fact that young people are ambitious to study but feel that it is economically and time-wise impossible, has specially added morning and evening classes. The morning class is from 6:00 am to 7:00 am, and the evening class is from 5:30 pm to 6:20 pm. Only a miscellaneous fee of two yuan is charged. The level and subjects are optional.

### Finance: Chinese Merchants Aggressively Buying Forward Foreign Exchange

The foreign exchange market saw no change in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) official rates. The unofficial market for British and American currencies was calm in the morning but changed suddenly in the evening. The opening saw further narrowing of overseas US and British exchange rates by one cent, continuing the trend of British currency being flat and US currency being tight. The rates were initially quoted at 4 pence 140625 and 6 yuan 65625. After the opening, the situation was stagnant. Although foreign firms, speculators, and Japanese firms successively bought in, the supply was still sufficient, so there was no movement for half a day. The situation only began to stabilize in the afternoon. At 2:15 PM, a Chinese bank first aggressively bought US dollars for April delivery. At the same time, speculators also became active, and Japanese firms continued to purchase, causing the market to suddenly soften. Fortunately, the British pound was supported by HSBC, so the tightening trend was slight. By the close, the British pound was at 4 pence 125, and the US dollar was at 6 yuan 59375, the tightest price of the day. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British pound softened by 0.015625 and the US dollar narrowed by 0.09375. The futures market showed a slight convergence with the spot market.

Morning Initially Calm

The morning began calmly, with London's long-term rates each narrowing by 25, the New York silver price remaining flat, and the London gold price remaining stable. Exchange rates for British currency against US, French, and other currencies were all flat. The US dollar continued to fall by one cent against the British pound, with no change against Shanghai, and a slight drop against the French franc. The Central Bank's official rates were unavailable due to the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, and the bank was closed as usual. The opening selling prices for spot rates were 4 pence 40625 for the British pound and 6 yuan 65625 for the US dollar, which were flat and 0.03125 tighter respectively compared to the previous close, due to the narrowed exchange rates. After the opening, foreign firms bought in, with outside firms buying a small amount of spot British pounds at 4 pence 140625, a very flat situation. HSBC announced that the official rates would not change. Later, a Chinese bank sold British pounds for April delivery at 4 pence 125 on behalf of a Hong Kong firm, while a Shanghai Chinese bank sold US dollars for April delivery to a peer bank at 6 yuan 59375, and a money exchange business sold Dehua US dollar bills at 6 yuan 75. Supply and demand were balanced, with little change. Soon, speculators also bought US dollars for the current month at 6 yuan 625 from outside firms, followed by a Japanese firm purchasing US dollars for April delivery at 6 yuan 5625 from a certain bank. The situation continued to be stagnant and flat. However, later in the session, a speculator wanted to buy US dollars for the current month, but outside firms were unwilling to sell at higher prices, so they were unsuccessful. Until the close, spot prices for both the British and US currencies were the same as the opening prices. Futures, however, saw the British pound flat and the US dollar slightly softer, with 6 yuan 625 difficult to close for the current month and only 6 yuan 53125 for the following month.

Afternoon Suddenly Tightens

The market initially opened steadily in the afternoon. Later, because a Chinese bank took the lead in aggressively buying US dollars for April delivery, followed by Japanese firms and speculators also actively trading in futures, the market suddenly tightened. It is estimated that a Chinese bank bought US dollars for April delivery from Chase and other foreign firms at 6 yuan 53125 and half a yuan. At the same time, speculators also bought US dollars for April delivery at 6 yuan 50 from Youli Bank, and a Japanese firm bought British pounds for the same month at 4 pence 078125 from a foreign firm. At the same time, foreign firms also bought spot British pounds at 4 pence 125 from HSBC, so the tightening trend for the British pound was slight. By the close, the British pound was at 4 pence 125, and the US dollar was at 6 yuan 59375. British pounds for the current month were at 4 pence 125, and US dollars were difficult to close at 6 yuan 59375. British pounds for the following month were at 4 pence 078125, and US dollars were at 6 yuan 50. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British pounds tightened by 0.015625, and US dollars softened by 0.09375. Futures saw the British pound flat and the US dollar narrow by 0.0625.

Hong Kong US Dollar Also Narrows

Hong Kong, 12th (Tuesday) - The exchange market opened flat today. Spot British pounds were unchanged, and forward rates eased by 0.03125 to 1 shilling 2 pence 84375. Spot US dollars tightened by 0.0625 to 23 yuan 875. Spot Shanghai currency fell slightly by 2.5 cents to 357 yuan 2.5 cents. Spot Japanese currency also narrowed by 2.5 cents to 101 yuan 2.5 cents. At 11:30 AM, the market was stable, with British and Japanese currencies unchanged. Spot US dollars continued to tighten by 0.0625 to 23 yuan 8125, and spot Shanghai currency continued to fall by 2.5 cents to 357 yuan. The market softened slightly at noon, with spot US dollars narrowing further by 0.0625 to 23 yuan 75. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the market opened softly, with no change in any currency.

Tianjin Currencies All Rise

Tianjin, 12th (Tuesday) - The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot British pounds eased by 0.03125 to 3 pence 75, spot US dollars rose by 0.0625 to 6 yuan 0625, and Shanghai currency fell by 1 yuan to 109 yuan 50 cents. "United Notes" in the gray market were valued at 1 yuan 50 cents, at 101 yuan 50 cents.

### A Certain Bank Aggressively Enters: Gold Market Rises Again; Approaching the 4,900 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's unofficial market for spot gold continued to rise, as speculators became more eager to buy, and Hong Kong buyers remained strong. It was also rumored that a certain Chinese bank was also buying in the market. The tightening foreign exchange rate in the afternoon further encouraged buyers to move forward, and the rising momentum was strong, continuing until the close, rising by 92 yuan. For the day's trading, the morning opened with a rise of 7 yuan, to 4,800 yuan, due to the slightly tighter US dollar. Subsequently, silver shop buyers came in to sell, briefly returning to 4,797 yuan, but Hong Kong buyers suddenly became active. Certain gold shops and retail investors also rushed to buy in, and soon a certain money exchange business also bought on behalf of a local buyer, reaching as high as 4,830 yuan. Before long, as retail investors were willing to sell to realize profits, and gold shops sold again, the price briefly fell by more than ten yuan. Certain money exchange businesses took the opportunity to buy again, so the noon close was still at 4,815 yuan. In the afternoon, because a certain money exchange business continued to aggressively buy, and securities buyers were also eager to enter, coupled with the sudden tightening of the foreign exchange rate, and retail shorts were forced to cover their positions, although a certain gold shop had initially sold off, it unexpectedly switched to buying near the close. Therefore, by the evening close, the high point of 4,885 yuan was reached. The day's trading was active with 2,500-2,600 taels changing hands. Gold jewelry rose by 10 yuan, while customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Spot Rose by 92 Yuan

From the morning, because of the rumor of a slightly weaker US dollar, sentiment remained strong. Certain gold shops and securities buyers bid up prices and bought in. The opening price was 7 yuan higher, with a gold shop buying 50 taels from a silver shop at 4,800 yuan. Shortly after, silver shop buyers and cash shops sold, causing the price to fall by 3 yuan. A cash shop sold 20 taels to a securities buyer at 4,797 yuan. Subsequently, Hong Kong buyers suddenly became active, entrusting certain gold shops and silver shops to buy in on their behalf. At the same time, money exchange businesses also followed suit on behalf of retail investors, causing the price to immediately jump up, soon reaching beyond the 4,810 yuan mark. At that time, certain money exchange businesses also aggressively bought, and the rising momentum was strong, jumping another ten yuan. A gold shop bought 30 taels from silver shop buyers at 4,830 yuan. Because certain gold shops realized profits and sold off again, and retail longs also slightly liquidated, and at that time buyers' appetite turned stagnant, the price fell by 14 yuan. A cash shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange business at 4,816 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange business bought again, and certain securities buyers also bought in, so the price slowly rose again, reaching as high as 4,825 yuan by the close. The afternoon was even more robust, with the opening price 5 yuan higher. A silver shop bought 30 taels from a securities buyer at 4,830 yuan. Before long, a certain money exchange business and Hong Kong buyers aggressively bought in, and securities buyers also bought in, and at that time the foreign exchange rate was promising, rising another 50 yuan. Securities buyers bought a total of 100 taels from silver shops and silver shop buyers at 4,880 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly aggressively sold off, pulling back 24 yuan. Securities buyers traded 30 taels among themselves at 4,856 yuan. Later, because the US dollar continued to tighten, buying momentum rose again. A certain gold shop suddenly stopped selling and aggressively bought in. At the same time, certain money exchange businesses and securities buyers aggressively bought again, raising the price by another 29 yuan. A silver shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange business at 4,885 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, the price rose sharply by 92 yuan. The price fluctuated by 88 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was several yuan higher based on the spot price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the official price, with little trading.

Gold Jewelry Raised by 10 Yuan

The initial exchange price of gold jewelry from major silver shops was still 485 yuan per tael. By 10:30 AM, it was raised by 5 yuan. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, it was raised by another 5 yuan. As a result, the major silver shops changed the exchange price to 495 yuan. New silver shops had the same price as the previous price, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Bank Clearing House Continues to Increase Exchange Rate Interest

"Note": Compared to March 2, the national currency interest rate has not changed, and the exchange rate interest rate has increased by 2 cents.

### US Dollar Bills Once Reached 15 Yuan

Yesterday, foreign currencies were heavily absorbed due to the weak pound price, and the market price was very firm. There was a scarce supply of British and American gold pounds, and there was strong demand for British and American gold notes. The morning price of US dollar notes rose to 14 yuan 81 cents, and the afternoon price rose further to 15 yuan. The evening market fell slightly to 14 yuan 98 cents. The supply of Hong Kong notes and French francs was not smooth. Singapore notes and Dutch notes rose sharply. Canadian notes and Philippine notes tracked expensively.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Both Fall; US Silver Remains Flat

London, 11th - The silver market saw a small number of public sales, lacking support, and remained flat after the close. Large silver bars, both near and far terms, narrowed by 25. New York silver report: US spot remained flat. Also, Mumbai silver report: The Indian silver market was weak, with both current and forward rates falling by 12 annas.

The discount interest rate of the Money Industry Association rose by one cent in both the morning and afternoon markets, reaching 1 jiao 7 fen, it is said.

### Yarn & Cotton: Guangdong Buyers Slightly Active in Spring Sales; Cotton Yarn Rising More Sharply; Double Horse Futures Raised to 948 Yuan

The yarn market continued to rise, and the rising momentum became even more intense. This was due to the unanimous bullish sentiment and extreme enthusiasm. At the same time, Guangdong buyers' spring sales of 32-count and 20-count fine yarn improved, triggering buying momentum, and speculators took the opportunity to fuel the trend. However, it has recently been heard that the rising momentum of a certain yarn is more moderate and not as rapid as that of the local yarn. If the price ratio differs too much, Chinese yarn will also be constrained.

The morning opening of the current yarn market saw continued strong sentiment, with a continuous stream of buyers. The opening price for March delivery of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 939 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had narrowed by 0.03125, and multiple parties were even more active. The market rose step by step, reaching 947-8 yuan. The closing price was 947 and a half yuan. It is estimated that the total trading volume for half a day was 1,970 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 16 yuan. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:

Hong Kong 735 Inland 55

Peers 1,180 Total 1,970

### Pricing of Indian Cotton Gradually Approaching; Cotton Not as Expensive as Yarn

The trading of local cotton was still fairly good, but rarer than the previous day. The market saw no significant fluctuations. Although the yarn market was rising step by step, the cotton market was mild and flat, which was due to the lack of development in factory demand. At the same time, the pricing of Indian cotton was gradually approaching, and various cotton shops began to order Indian cotton. Therefore, sentiment in the cotton market was not as high as in the yarn market. There was no sign of cotton from northern Jiangsu. The current cotton transaction situation is listed below:

In addition, the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, initially saw a rising market with a lack of important buyers, and a telegram from Liverpool reported a fall, causing the market to appear quite sluggish. In addition, overseas cotton merchants were selling in the market. As a result, the closing price for the near term fell by 45 pounds. However, the far term rose by 3 pounds. The Indian cotton market fell by another 4 rupees yesterday, including predictions, due to the talk of a European peace atmosphere. Egyptian rose by 35 pounds.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Due to the tightening of the exchange rate in recent days, trading between peers has been quite quiet. Manufacturers are purchasing with limited interest due to the large number of arrivals. The same is true for Japanese factories. The shipping price to the factory calculated based on the US dollar exchange rate of 6 yuan 625 is as follows:

20-count American Middling 269.20

20-count American Low Middling 258.50

32-count American Middling 282.00

32-count American Low Middling 271.00

42-count American Middling 285.20

42-count American Low Middling 273.20

### Securities: Domestic Bond Market Flat; Foreign Stocks Flat and Weak

Securities

Yesterday, the unofficial securities market spent the day in a state of churning and brewing. There has been no upward or downward movement for many days. If it is said that the money supply is too tight and there are insufficient investment funds, then gold rose sharply again yesterday, and foreign stock trading is still developed. If it is said that there is no change in the environment, then the gradual tightening of the foreign exchange rate is enough to reflect the changes in the situation. These are not the key points. Since the rise in goods prices, speculators inevitably have their own intentions and manipulate the market. In this harsh flood, the market relies entirely on the fact that major financial institutions retain large amounts of capital and do not release it. The liquid chips in the market are limited. Without drastic changes, it is not easy to cause fluctuations. Therefore, the market has been able to maintain its intermediate market price over the years. The endless churning seen now is nothing new, so it is temporarily not expected to change. Yesterday, buyers and sellers were particularly indifferent, and the market gathering dispersed in less than ten minutes. As a result, there were only 5-cent fluctuations. The total daily trading volume was around 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 20 shares of Continental Bank stock were traded, with a price of 600 yuan per share. This is a deciduous stock, with a face value of 1,000 yuan per share, equivalent to a 60% market price.

Yesterday, the stock markets of various public firms were closed in commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death anniversary, and the stock market was very gloomy as a result. Trading was scarce in the morning, and prices were stable. The market was more lively in the afternoon, because there were slightly more sellers, so prices fell slightly. Near the close, the selling lines showed signs of wavering, and most prices returned to their original levels. The closing trend was stable, and rubber bonds were uneventful.

London

London, 10th (Monday) - It is reported that the official rates for Chinese foreign debt and British Far East company stocks were stable today. There were no upward or downward movements for any bonds or stocks.

### Seafood: First Batch of New Fragrant Mushrooms Arrived

Yesterday, a certain company received 10 pieces of new fragrant mushrooms from Chuzhou, with a price of 675 yuan 6 jiao. It is said that a large batch is expected to arrive on the next ship, and the market trend is bearish. It is reported that the production price of Jian mushrooms has risen by another 30 yuan.

### Food: Wuxi Rice Falls Sharply; Foreign Rice Also Arrives in Shanghai

In the Wuxi rice and paddy market, hoarders and cargo ships have been actively selling in recent days. The number of rice and paddy samples appearing in the market has increased daily. Although rice mills have contracted to sell 60,000 piculs of white japonica rice, rice millers are limited by their existing stock and cannot enter the market to make up for their contracted sales. As a result, the active market atmosphere has reversed from its previous outlook, leading to an oversupply situation. The market price of rice and paddy has gradually eased. In the past three days, the price of unpolished white japonica rice has fallen by about 2 yuan per picul, and the price of japonica and indica paddy has also fallen by 1 yuan per dan. Currently, high-quality white japonica rice is priced at 27 yuan 5 jiao to 27 yuan per picul, unpolished japonica rice is at 24 yuan 5 jiao, and japonica paddy is at 12 yuan 7-8 jiao per dan. The market has entered a normal state. Since the beginning of the red disk for miscellaneous grains, the prices of yellow tea beans, wheat, and sesame have risen sharply, with each picul soaring by more than 10 yuan. Recently, prices in Shanghai have also gradually fallen, causing sentiment in Wuxi to be uniformly bearish. As a result, those with stock are eager to sell, as profits have already been huge. Within the week, the price of yellow mung beans and sesame has fallen drastically by 10 yuan per picul, and the price of wheat has also fallen by several yuan. The price of flour this year has risen gradually from 11-12 yuan per bag to 14-15 yuan, purely due to speculative trading and monopoly. The total amount of flour stored in the city is over 200,000 bags, most of which are in the hands of hoarders. The daily flour consumption of the entire town is less than 100 bags. If the export of this stored flour is prohibited, it can be sold until the end of the year. Seeing the downward trend in Shanghai recently, they are eager to sell, with the price of current flour as low as 12 yuan 3-4 jiao and the price of futures flour as low as 11 yuan, but there are few interested buyers. The price has fallen by 2 yuan per bag within the last ten days. (Knowing)

Foreign rice also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taigu company's Taiyuan ship brought 4,347 bags from Haiphong and 5,310 bags from Hong Kong, totaling 9,657 bags. It was imported at noon yesterday and unloaded at the company's wharf in the French Concession. (Zu)

### Sugar Market: Upper Grade Cart White Recovers Well

Yesterday's sugar market saw little significant fluctuation. The association's official price for current goods was 62 yuan for unbleached white sugar at the company's warehouse and 61 yuan 6 jiao for newly arrived sugar at the outer warehouse and 61 yuan 3 jiao for old goods, a rise of only 1 jiao. Cart white from Taigu recovered by 3-5 jiao. West Warehouse B mark also arrived at 66 yuan, CX mark at 65 yuan and a half, CX mark unchanged, DY mark at 64 yuan, a rise of 2 jiao. There were few changes in the rest. There were minor transactions in domestic sugar, and the price also stabilized. In addition, 2,200 bags of sugar arrived from Haikou on the 12th.

### Metals: Bamboo Steel Bars Slightly Stabilize

The trading of bamboo steel bars remained frequent yesterday. Most of the transactions were handled by construction groups on this street. However, out-of-town business was also active. Due to the high spirits of peers, the market price remained strong. However, it has fallen by a large amount of 50-60 yuan compared to the past. At the moment, 3-4 points sell for 1,050 yuan per ton and 5 points to one inch for 1,000 yuan per ton, it is said.

### Cloth: Sales of Woolen Fabrics are Not Weak

Yesterday, the sales of woolen fabrics were not sluggish, with wholesale merchants sending many packages by post. Inland merchants mostly ordered khaki and grass-green serge, Walter cloth, riding breeches cloth, and uniform cloth. For commercial woolen fabrics, only domestic products are accepted, and a sales license issued by the manufacturer is required. These are piled up in the occupied areas because there are no restrictions on the country of origin, resulting in higher sales than in the interior, especially in the Tianjin and Beijing areas.

### Silk and Tea: Dried Cocoons Originate in Shanghai; Silk Factories' Raw Material Panic Can Be Resolved

Although Shanghai silk factories generally made profits last year, their development was limited because their raw materials were controlled by others. By the end of the year and the beginning of this year, almost all silk factories had shut down. Now, it is learned that Zhejiang East cocoons have been arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream. The first batch, transported by the Haida Wheel, totaled 1,012 pieces. The second and third batches will also be transported in succession. Therefore, before the new cocoons come onto the market, the raw material panic of silk factories may be partially resolved.

It is also reported that 25 cases of rayon arrived from Hong Kong yesterday, and 1,660 pieces of tea arrived from Ningbo.

### New Situation and the Raw Silk Industry

— Yi Zhi

In the third year of the war, drastic changes are taking place both domestically and abroad. These changes have formed the current new situation, namely, the outbreak of the European war, the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the establishment of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and the disintegration of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis. In the Sino-Japanese War, the opponent's international environment has become even more isolated. In addition, China's subjective strength has increased over the past three years. As a result, this new situation has also affected the raw silk industry. Because these circumstances are beneficial to China, they are also beneficial to the Chinese silk industry. However, to make good use of a favorable situation, it is necessary to explore the possible reactions of the new situation to the production and sales of raw silk.

(1) Some people say that the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation will greatly improve the sales of Chinese silk in the United States. Because the United States is the world's largest consumer of raw silk, the termination of the treaty will inevitably put Chinese silk's competitors at a disadvantage. This view is partially accurate. However, the reality is not so simple. Because the abrogation of the treaty does not mean an economic break between the United States and Japan, it is just a step taken by the U.S. rulers to force Japan to submit. At the same time, the word "submit" does not really mean "deal a fatal blow," but rather requires Japan to continue to exist aggressively in the Far East as an imperialist policeman within the U.S. limit (the limit of U.S.-Japan equilibrium). This is also a fierce constraint on China's liberation and the development of China's national capital. For this reason, although the United States' purchase of Japanese silk is not bound by any treaty, it will not decrease as much as we would like. On the contrary, it will continue to transport large quantities of military supplies and gasoline to Japan (see the Reuters dispatch from Havana on February 29 regarding the contradictions of the United States). And Japanese silk will continue to be shipped to the U.S. market in a steady stream. However, there may be some progress in the sale of Chinese silk in the United States. This is due to the sense of justice of the American people. This is a prediction for the sale of Chinese silk in the United States this year.

(2) On the European front, not to mention the spread of the European war, which may expand and destroy the markets of Britain and France and disrupt the entire European economic organization (however, in fact, this trend will be unavoidable), but just the impact of the termination of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation on the European silk market, the position of Chinese silk in Europe may be considerably squeezed. Because when Britain saw that the renewal of the U.S.-Japan Treaty was hopeless, it was eager to take this opportunity to increase the figures of trade with Japan (see the Reuters dispatch from London on February [day omitted]). At the same time, Japanese silk, subjectively, will of course have to find another way to make up for the losses caused by the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. In that case, the sale of Chinese silk to the United States will not have as much progress as ideal, but on the European side, it may suffer unexpected blows. The large amount of Japanese silk shipped to Britain and France is a prediction for the sale of Chinese silk in Europe this year.

Regarding this prediction, we must also consider the future progress of the European war. That is to say, even if the quantity of Japanese silk shipped to Europe is not too large, the European silk market will greatly add many difficulties due to the development of the war, in terms of transportation between Europe and Asia, and in the economic life of the entire European people, causing the market to shrink or stagnate.

### Commemoration of the Premier's Death: Shanghai Citizens Solemn and Determined; Yesterday, the Entire City Flew Flags at Half-Mast to Express Grief; Support National Policy and Strive for Final Victory

Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the death of the Premier. All sectors of the city lowered their flags to half-mast and ceased entertainment and banquets in deep mourning to commemorate the Premier's great revolutionary achievements and noble revolutionary character. Jianghai Customs, post offices, courts, and various public organizations and schools followed suit and took a holiday. The schools also held memorial services to expound on the Premier's revolutionary history as a model. All sectors believe that the Premier devoted his life to the revolution, aiming to seek freedom and equality for China. In the revolutionary process, his spirit of perseverance, courage, and indomitable spirit is forever a model for us. The Premier said on his deathbed, "Peaceful struggle to save China." The Chinese people deeply realize that peace was declared hopeless before the July 7th Incident. Only by resolutely struggling can we save China. Therefore, we are more determined to uphold the belief in the national policy, follow the revolutionary path indicated by the Premier, and strive for the realization of China's freedom and equality. The police departments of the two concessions dispatched additional detectives yesterday to inspect pedestrians on various roads, and patrol cars were also dispatched to patrol to prevent troublemakers. The whole day passed peacefully.

Expanded Promotion of the Honesty and Shame Movement

Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the Premier's death. The Honesty and Shame Movement Committee of all sectors of the city held a day of expanded promotion.

The original text has been seen in previous newspapers. At noon yesterday, the committee held a memorial service in the Siwei Hall, attended by more than 30 representatives from various district branches, various sector committees, and the general assembly. After performing the rituals and reciting the Honesty and Shame Movement creed, they specially observed three minutes of silence to commemorate the Premier's death and silently prayed for his spirit to protect the victory. Afterwards, Mr. Luo Ziqiang, the general secretary of the committee, gave a solemn speech with tears in his eyes, which moved the audience. After that, they held a vegetarian lunch. In the afternoon, they went to designated locations in various districts to inspect the work of the practice groups, and the results were quite satisfactory.

### The Banking Industry is Ordered to Promote Agricultural Loans; The Loan Amount Depends on the Needs of Various Regions, According to the Outline of Agricultural Loan Measures

Since the four banks, China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Bank, formulated the outline of agricultural loan measures for the 29th year, the banking industry in Shanghai has been ordered to promote it. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the banking sector yesterday that the loan amount will be determined by the Joint Office of the Four Banks at any time according to the actual needs of various regions. The Bank of China accounts for 25%, the Bank of Communications accounts for 15%, the Agricultural Bank of China accounts for 35%, the Central Trust Bureau accounts for 15%, and the Agricultural and Industrial Bank accounts for 10%. The loans are divided into (1) agricultural production loans, (2) agricultural supply and marketing loans, (3) agricultural product storage and mortgage loans, (4) agricultural water conservancy loans, (5) rural transportation tool loans, (6) tenant farmer land purchase loans, (7) rural sideline business loans, and (8) agricultural extension loans. It is reported that all commercial banks are jointly handling agricultural loans in various regions in accordance with the outline of agricultural loan measures, and all money houses have decided to participate in agricultural loans. The loan area is determined to be as widespread as possible, and the direct enjoyment of loan benefits by farmers is maximized. The procedures are simplified as much as possible to adapt to the farming season. The loan targets are agricultural groups, individual farmers, and agricultural improvement agencies. It is also reported that each bank has signed agricultural loan contracts with the governments of various provinces and is actively promoting agricultural loans.

### Judge Yu Ting's Posthumous Honor; Yu Gongzi is Studying in the United States; Chairman Chiang Ordered a Subsidy

After Yu Hua, the criminal court judge of the Second Branch of the Shanghai High Court, was assassinated and martyred, it was reported to the National Government. Now, his family received a condolence telegram from Chairman Chiang, which read, "To Madam Yu Chenyin, The sacrifice of Judge Yu is deeply mourned. Regarding the award and compensation, I have transferred the matter to President Ju of the Judicial Yuan to handle. As for your son Xingmin studying automotive engineering in the United States, I have telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to verify and subsidize his tuition fees in the United States. Zhongzheng, Special Secret Yu, February 19th, 29th year, Telex from the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government." This can be called posthumous honor.

### The Xin'an'na Steamer Will Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning; Passengers are Safe

The Xin'an'na steamer of Maersk Line ran aground in Wenzhou on the 10th, as reported yesterday. According to information, after the Xin'an'na steamer telegraphed that it had run aground, Maersk Line immediately sent a ship to rescue it.

### Oil Merchants from Zhejiang Province in Shanghai Organize an Oil Company

Since the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang, various types of oil from various parts of Zhejiang Province in this city have not been as strong as before due to transportation difficulties. It is now learned that various oil merchants in the production area, in order to seek smooth sales of local products, have jointly organized an Oil Co., Ltd. by Huilong Commercial Bank in this city, intending to specialize in various vegetable oils, such as lard, green oil, pine oil, vegetable oil, tea oil, etc., and transport them to Shanghai for sale. Preparations are actively underway.

### Domestic Rice Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities; Further Price Drops are Expected; Yesterday, People Crowded to Buy Rice at Fair Prices; There is No Fear of Rice Shortage in This City in the Future

The rice industry and tea market in this city were closed yesterday because it was the anniversary of the Premier's death. The market will be open as usual today. In recent days, not only have more than 100,000 bags of foreign rice flooded in, but also domestic rice from the surrounding countryside and inland ports, such as Kunshan and Luodian, has been transported in, resulting in sufficient rice supply in this city and the possibility of further price drops. Also, yesterday, due to the anniversary of the Premier's death, factories were closed, and the number of workers buying rice at fair prices suddenly increased, resulting in overcrowding in front of various rice shops selling rice at fair prices. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter passed by the Xinda Rice Shop on Lihmei Road in the French Concession and saw about 700 or 800 people buying rice at fair prices. Chinese and Western patrolmen were doing their best to maintain order on the spot, so no accidents occurred.

Large Quantities of Du Rice are Transported from the Surrounding Countryside

The Mainland Daily reports that according to well-informed sources in the business community, several rice merchants in this city have now pooled hundreds of trucks to buy Du rice in the surrounding countryside and transport it to the concession. The number of workers hired is at least three to four thousand, and the profits are very high. The only difficulty is that the rice must pass through the lines of Japanese sentries. According to a certain rice merchant, buying rice in Baoshan and Songjiang costs only 30 yuan per picul, and paying the Japanese soldiers 5 yuan per picul, and still can obtain high profits after transporting it to Shanghai. It is said that about 3,000 dan of rice have been transported into the concession through this route. In addition, about 3,000 bags have been transported into the concession by water in the past two weeks. Therefore, there is no fear of food shortage in this city, but the reason why rice prices are still surprisingly high is entirely due to speculation and profiteering.

### Five Chinese Directors Will Be Reelected in the Upcoming Municipal Council Election; All Parties Hope that the Five Directors Will Continue to Serve; British and American Directors Held Primaries

They still hope that the five Chinese directors of the previous term, Yu Qiaqing, Xi Yushu, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, and Jiang Yiping, will be re-elected. However, whether there will be any changes to one or two people has not yet been decided.

British and American Directors Hold Primaries

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that various British expatriate groups in this city have held primaries for the upcoming election of directors of the Municipal Council in order to vote for five Chinese directors and seven candidates. Taxpaying members of the American Union of Shanghai with the qualifications to elect directors of the Municipal Council will also participate in the association's primary to select two candidates from the three candidates, Karna, MacDonald, and Arlman. The number of people among the more than 1,000 members of the American Union of Shanghai who are eligible to vote has not yet been investigated. However, it is estimated that about 500 American expatriates in Shanghai are eligible to vote, and most of them are members of the American Union of Shanghai.

### Deliberations on the Resumption of Tram Transportation in the Northern District; Public Buses Have Not Been Negotiated; The Japanese Side's Attitude is Still Very Ambiguous

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that according to Mr. Owen, general manager of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company, he has been continuously consulting directly with the Japanese Consulate authorities regarding the resumption of tram transportation in the northern district of the Public Concession, and the British Consulate has also been mediating, but rumors that traffic will resume from Friday are untrue because the matter is still at a loss. Owen also denied that he had consulted with the Huazhong Metropolitan Bus Company, which is currently operating in the northern district. As for the resumption of bus services in the northern district by the British-owned Shanghai General Omnibus Company, Mr. Migg, chairman of the company, stated that the matter is still uncertain and negotiations have not yet begun. According to a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, the tram and bus companies must recognize the "de facto existence of public bus routes" in the northern district of the Public Concession, and all matters must be negotiated by the three companies themselves.

### Indian Coal Water Freight Increases Sharply; It Has Increased Fivefold Since the European War; Ships Are Scarce and Difficult to Obtain

The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association recently stated that the freight cost of coal is closely related to the cost of coal briquettes and has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting measures to reduce it. It is now heard that the import freight cost of Indian coal from Calcutta to Shanghai used to be 5 shillings per ton based on the ship's own weight. Since the current European war, it has increased to more than 25 shillings, and ships are not easy to obtain. Moreover, due to the war, it is impossible to sign long-term contracts for Indian coal. Even the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which needs the most coal every year, cannot sign a contract.

### The Shelter for the Poor Postpones Dissolution; Currently Sheltering More Than 1,000 Poor People

The Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation previously established a shelter for the poor in North Fujian Road and Difeng Road to provide relief to poor people, sheltering more than 1,100 people. Now that the earth has returned to spring and the climate has gradually become warmer, it was originally planned to dissolve it immediately. However, due to the current high prices, the poor people who were sheltered from the cold would inevitably become starved to death if they were left without support once they left the shelter. Therefore, the dissolution date has been specially postponed to promote good deeds. Since the association began providing steamed buns and ginger soup at Dahua Road and Mabai Road, donations from all parties have been very enthusiastic. It has now been decided to continue the activity, but every Sunday will be changed to a holiday and stopped. The poor people waiting for relief have been notified.

### Reduction of Coal Slurry Freight is Difficult to Postpone; Yu Qiaqing Asks the Municipal Council to Invite Various Shipping Companies to Discuss

After the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Association requesting Yu Qiaqing to contact the reduction of coal dust freight, it has now received a reply from Yu stating, "Regarding the matter of various machine-made coal briquette factories selling raw materials for coal briquettes at a fair price and reducing freight costs, I have asked the Municipal Council authorities to invite various shipping companies to discuss the reduction. As it concerns social stability, it should be realized as soon as possible. This is to reply. I hope you will cooperate." In order to discuss proper measures, the Shanghai Fair Price Coal Briquette Committee specially convened a meeting of the entire committee at 4:00 p.m. yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Hong Kong Road. More than ten people attended, including Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiyin, Yan Esheng, Wei Zhida, Bao Zhexiong, Lu Qisheng, Yun Chunxin, and Chen Cuifang. Chairman Xu Jiyin first reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by representatives of various fuel industries reporting on the situation of selling coal briquettes at fair prices and the serious impact on various coal briquette factories due to the high freight costs of coal dust. Yu Qiaqing approved on the spot to find a way. Then, discussions began. Various proposals must be formally decided before they can be announced. The meeting adjourned at 6:15.

### Small Packets of Mail Must Be Firmly Packaged to Avoid Dampness and Breakage; Otherwise, the Post Office Will Not Accept Them

Since the military rise, traffic has been blocked in various places, transportation has been stagnant, and postal transportation has been difficult. The Transportation Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration is doing its best to unblock postal deliveries in various places to comfort people from all over the country who are in Shanghai. However, all packages, large and small, inevitably suffer damage due to the time-consuming transportation. Therefore, all senders must properly package them in advance. The following is an excerpt from the announcement of the small package mail group of the bureau: "For announcement, the packaging method for small packages of mail is subject to the regulations for parcel packaging, which have been clearly stated in Article 209 of the Postal Regulations. It has now been found that the small packages of mail sent by various merchants recently often break in the middle due to improper packaging, and the contents are damaged, especially small packages of medicines. They are not packed in sturdy wooden boxes and sufficiently filled with wood chips, cotton, and other items. Therefore, a special announcement is made, and all merchants should pay attention. In the future, small packages with improper packaging will not be accepted. This is the announcement." A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the parcel business group of the bureau yesterday that for all packages, large and small, sent from Shanghai to various places, the packages are transported with many turns, and the equipment of various post offices is not yet perfect. If it rains, they will inevitably be exposed to moisture. Therefore, it is best for the senders of various packages to use wooden boxes to avoid any hidden dangers.

### When Applying for Certificates for Woven Fabrics, Sales Vouchers Should Be Attached

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various yarn companies yesterday regarding the matter of issuing certificates for domestic cotton yarn and woven fabrics, stating, "It has been found that the yarn sold by various yarn factories from March 1st onwards is accompanied by sales vouchers, which are given to customers for safekeeping. When applying for a certificate, this sales voucher should be sent to the association for verification and cancellation in order to prevent the abuse of one certificate for two uses. Please follow this procedure."

### Post Office Develops Japanese Military Drafts Without Reporting to the Head Office; Purely a One-Sided Agreement to Accommodate the Bad Environment; Post Offices Within the Concessions Refuse to Develop Them

The Shanghai Postal Administration surprisingly complied with the Japanese request and developed drafts for Japanese military scrip in [ports] such as Hankou and Jiujiang. The details are as follows:

Violating Regulations

The Shanghai Postal Administration, complying with the Japanese request, surprisingly began on the 10th of this month to allow the public to develop drafts in Japanese military scrip for [ports] such as Hankou and Jiujiang through post offices. This measure completely contradicts the postal remittance regulations, and is thus attracting considerable attention.

Not Reported

This matter was purely a one-sided agreement between the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, Zha Peilin, and the Japanese Deputy Postmaster, Kanezashi Kinjiro, with the Japanese side, and was not reported to the head office for approval. It is believed that after learning of this matter, the head office will certainly send a telegram of inquiry.

Bureau Refuses to Issue

The handling of military scrip exchange is still limited to implementation in occupied areas. Therefore, all postal branches within the two concessions of Shanghai are not following suit. Only the Heng Road branch in Hongkou can handle remittances, and the paying offices are limited to Hankou and Jiujiang.

Bureau's Justification

According to a person close to postal circles who spoke to the Datong News Agency reporter, the post office's move is purely to cope with the environment and avoid friction between Japanese military personnel and post offices in the occupied areas. Therefore, it is hoped that the outside world can understand their predicament.

### Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign to Open Soon; Scheduled to Be Held at Hongqiao Sanatorium; Free X-ray Photography and Examination

The large-scale Shanghai anti-tuberculosis campaign, jointly initiated by leaders from all sectors of the city, has been gradually prepared and is ready. Yesterday, a reception was held at the Bankers' Club for all sectors and the press. Attendees included Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Jiqing, Pei Yunqing, Ding Fubao, Zhao Jinqing, Jiang Yiping, Ge Futian, Pan Yangyao, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Huang Yuzhai, Wang Jian'e, He Wuliang, Zhu Gengtao, Luo Zhican, Zhu Yutao, Wang Wanbai, Zhu Yanggao, Dong Xingsheng, Wang Jingdong, Huang Jiayin, Sun Choucheng, Ding Huikang, Lin Zhifu, Jiang Yiqiu, and others, totaling over one hundred people.

General Success of Tuberculosis Prevention in Various Countries

Mr. Lin Kanghou was publicly elected as chairman. The chairman then elaborated on the importance of this campaign, stating that people all over the world are suffering from tuberculosis. In the United States at the beginning of this century, the tuberculosis mortality rate was the highest of all mortality rates, but now it has dropped to sixth place. In Germany, it has also decreased from twelve deaths per ten thousand people to seven. This achievement is due to the progress of hygiene and medical care in various countries, but in reality, it is also thanks to efforts in tuberculosis prevention.

Status Quo of the Isolated Island: Rampant Tuberculosis

However, our country is the country with the most tuberculosis cases. Due to the lack of public health facilities and the lack of attention to tuberculosis prevention methods, the mortality rate from tuberculosis is increasing rather than decreasing. In the current special circumstances of the isolated island, the population has increased sharply, the environment is deteriorating, and the spread of tuberculosis is becoming more rampant. The general patient families cling to old habits, rely entirely on ineffective drugs, and delay treatment, which is the biggest reason for the high tuberculosis rate. Not only do patients suffer incalculable losses in life, time, and economy, but society and the country also lose talent and reduce production, and the indirect losses are incalculable. This is truly heartbreaking.

The Way to Save Lives Lies in Diagnosis

The way to save lives is to awaken society, impart knowledge of tuberculosis prevention, break bad habits, and trust in correct diagnosis. X-ray examination is the only condition for reducing lung disease and its spread. Anyone who wants to know if they have lung disease, or to what extent, must rely on X-ray diagnosis as the most accurate judge. This X-ray diagnosis is even more beneficial if performed early.

Emphasizing Inspection to Prevent Spread

The number of latent tuberculosis patients is extremely large, and sometimes they are also open, meaning that their sputum contains tubercle bacilli, but the patients are unaware. These tubercle bacilli are the source of tuberculosis transmission, and their harm is more dangerous than a city tiger. However, once X-ray diagnosis is performed, latent tuberculosis can be detected. On the one hand, early treatment can save time and money and achieve twice the result with half the effort. On the other hand, it can reduce the risk of transmission, which is of great importance to family happiness, public health, and social health. Deputy chairmen Yuan Ludeng, Pei Yunqing, Xu Guanqun, Huang Yuzhai, and Tao Leqin also spoke in succession, each with extremely thorough remarks, and the audience applauded.

Young Men and Women Should Pay Special Attention

Yuan Ludeng said in his speech that in the past, our country's people were stubborn, and those who suffered from tuberculosis would never reveal it to others. The most patients are between the ages of 20 and 30, which is also the most dangerous. He hoped that everyone would vigorously publicize it so that everyone would have the opportunity to take precautions in advance. Xu Guanqun said in his speech that the seriousness of the tuberculosis prevention problem is no less than the people's food problem. In ancient times, there were those who used secret prescriptions and elixirs to treat diseases. Everyone knows how effective they are. It is enough to prove that drugs can only play an auxiliary role. The key to disease is prevention. Dr. Wang Wanbai talked about the mortality rate in China, which is generally (including women, children, and the elderly) one in seven, meaning that one in seven deaths is due to tuberculosis. Between the ages of 20 and 30, it is one in three, meaning that one in three deaths is due to tuberculosis. To eliminate this great enemy of mankind, we must mobilize all sectors of the city to publicize it widely.

Ding Huikang Talks About the Motivation for Tuberculosis Prevention

Finally, Dr. Ding Huikang spoke about the motivation for this campaign, stating that in the physical examinations of students in Chongqing two years ago, only 65 out of 10,000 people were healthy. This shows the unsoundness of the Chinese physique. There are two differences between Chinese and foreign medicine. Foreigners value examination and treatment only after diagnosis, while Chinese people do the opposite, valuing medication and neglecting examination. Patients hope to recover immediately, but this procedure is detrimental to both their mental and economic well-being. Individual health is of great importance to the country's future. He hopes that people from all walks of life will work together to promote it.

Various Parties Support Scheduled Implementation

All parties unanimously support this large-scale tuberculosis prevention campaign. In its implementation plan, in addition to popularizing early X-ray diagnosis, it will also carry out basic work such as free X-ray photography, free sputum examination, and free tuberculosis diagnosis. It has now been decided to start on the 15th of this month at the Hongqiao Sanatorium at 990 Avenue Joffre. Its contribution to improving the health of citizens and benefiting the general poor and sick is truly significant.

### New Subsidiary Coins in Circulation; Old Coins Cease Exchange and Issuance

Since the outbreak of the European War, the source of nickel has been cut off and prices have soared. In order to prevent manipulation and melting by unscrupulous merchants, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Central Bank Issuance Bureau to order all branches to stop exchanging and issuing nickel coins, and to revise the Subsidiary Coin Regulations to issue new subsidiary coins. The fineness and weight of these coins have been reduced. It is reported that the new subsidiary coins have been minted by the Central Mint, divided into 1-fen, 2-fen, 5-fen, and 10-fen denominations, and issued by the Central Bank. They are already in circulation in Chongqing and other places.

### Plank Box Industry Workers Resume Work This Morning

The plank box industry workers in this city recently made a request to the capitalists to improve their treatment on the grounds that prices are soaring and their livelihoods are difficult. They went on strike the day before yesterday. The Plank Box Industry Association has now resolved to first persuade the workers to work as usual today. If they have legitimate demands, they can send responsible representatives to formally submit them to the association's office at No. 10, Lane 70, Jing'an Temple Road at any time. It is reported that after persuasion, the workers have agreed to resume work today.

### Most of the Bodies in the Jingsheng Ferry Boat Retrieved

After the divers hired by Tianhu began to salvage the bodies in the Jingsheng barge that capsized in Ningbo on the 8th, they worked day and night and were very active. Initially, the accumulation of bodies in the boat made salvage time-consuming. After they were taken out one by one, the cabin became loose, so a large number of bodies were recovered in the past two days.

The salvage was still continuing yesterday.

### Robbers Refused Arrest at Avenue Dubail the Night Before Last; Tear Gas Grenade Thrown; Four Robbers Arrested

At about 6:30 the night before last, Russian police officer Xue Laofu of the French Police Department, after finishing his duties at the police station, returned to his apartment at No. 275 Avenue Dubail. He was about to have dinner when a friend of Xue, A, told him that there was a suspicious Chinese man outside Room 1 on the ground floor, who was peeping suspiciously. After Xue heard this, he went out to investigate and noticed that there were several men searching drawers in the room where Chen, the manager of the former Jiangnan Bank, lived. Xue knew that they were thieves, so he remained calm and notified the police station by telephone, and immediately went downstairs to question the thief who was on guard at the door. The thief knew that things were not good and turned to escape. Xue was about to chase him when he noticed that another thief had also jumped out of the window. He immediately chased after him. Another thief, seeing this, fired two shots at Xue from the bathroom, but missed. Xue chased him to Avenue des Acres and finally caught the thief. At this time, a large team of Chinese and Western detectives from the police station had arrived at the scene. They learned that there were still remaining thieves hiding in the room, unable to escape. The police officers ordered the thieves in the room to drop their weapons and surrender, but the thieves remained silent. The detectives threw several tear gas grenades into the room from the window, and as a result, three thieves were captured in the room, and a pistol, a Mauser pistol, and all the stolen goods were confiscated.

### Rampant Gambling in Nanshi; Intense Jealousy and Competition Among Peers; Pseudo-Municipal Government Attempts to Seize Gambling Tax

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reports that it is heard there is a new gambling den on MingGuo Road in Nanshi which has obtained a license from the Japanese authorities. It is scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. By the end of this month, the number of gambling parlors in Nanshi will increase to twenty, which will continue to pay taxes to the Japanese authorities. However, both the "Municipal Government" and other parties are trying to compete for this tax revenue. Recently, a Mr. Yu is said to be willing to pay 3 million per quarter to obtain a complete monopoly on gambling parlors in Nanshi.

Pseudo-bureau gambling dens in various places in Nanshi are springing up like mushrooms after rain, everywhere. Opposite and next door, they compete with each other, resulting in jealousy and open and secret struggles among peers. Cases of murder and theft occur from time to time. The Japanese and puppets turn a blind eye and take the opportunity to squeeze and reap the benefits. Nanshi, which is truly the second most evil land, will have even more unimaginable disasters in the future. The pseudo-bureau gambling dens that have already opened in various places in Nanshi are

Investigated as Follows: Heng'an Company, No. 24 Heng'anfang, Nanyang Bridge; Huasheng Company, No. 44; Xieli Company, No. 24 Wengjia Lane, Old West Gate; Liyuan Club, No. 1, Jiheli Lane, No. 27; Xinsheng Company, No. 79; Dazhong Company, No. 263 Fuyou Road; Baoxing Company, No. 479; Huasen Company, No. 89, Anren Street, Baoren Street; Jinerlai Company, No. 196 Luxiangyuan Road, Jiumudi; Ren'an Entertainment Club, No. 20, Ren'anli Lane, No. 85; Xiejie Company, No. 1, Anrenli, Qinglian Street, Dajing Road; Dali Company, No. 31, Xima Street, Fangbang Road; Nanyuan Company, No. 12, Yiqing Street; Lisheng Entertainment Venue, No. 1, Zhenyeli Lane, No. 1037 MingGuo Road, Xiaobeimen; Leili Company, No. 40 Lusi Street, Dongjiadu, Xiaonanmen, Zhonghua Road. In addition, a certain large gambling den at No. 501 MingGuo Road

Is Nearing Completion; The organizers come to supervise the work every day, hoping to open soon. At the same time, there are countless others preparing to open. However, the Japanese and puppets in Nanshi are currently busy investigating the population, and the so-called citizen certificates or passes for entering and leaving the iron gates will not be abolished in the near future. Although the pseudo-bureau gambling dens have become an open secret, they have not been officially recognized and issued licenses to operate, or they cannot last long. Moreover, the French authorities, in view of the past

Disturbances and Disasters on the Border; The Nanshi gambling dens are adjacent to the concession, so they are deeply concerned and paying attention to their evolution. It is necessary to reconsider the open iron gates, or even close them, to maintain security.

### Social News

After the firm's manager Zheng Hegeng discovered it and reported it to the police, the three defendants were arrested one after another, and two accomplices, Yu Chuangen and Shen Baokang, were also detained. They were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. After Judge Sun interrogated them many times, the details were repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. The trial continued yesterday morning. The waiter of No. 12 Shenzhou Hotel was summoned to the court to testify. Since the case was clear, he ordered the debate to be opened and scheduled the sentencing. The defendants were remanded in custody.

At about 11:00 yesterday morning, about 60 or 70 Japanese and puppet military and police suddenly went to Qibao Town in western Shanghai to search residents' shops house by house. All account books were confiscated and pedestrians were inspected. Dozens of people were arrested at the time. The situation was tense for a while, and the villagers fled one after another. The market is now extremely depressed, but gambling dens are open all night long. Opium and morphine are sold everywhere, and daytime robberies are common. It has become a world of all evils.

Shao Sihai, a native of Yangzhou who lives at No. 25 Peifuli, Avenue Lagrene, French Concession, is 60 years old this year. He used to work in the entertainment industry, but retired due to old age and weakness. Recently, he has been troubled by economics and unable to maintain his livelihood, which led to a short-sighted view. On the night of the 11th at 11:00, he secretly swallowed raw opium at home and committed suicide. After his son Shao Yanting discovered it, he was sent to Renji Hospital. Due to his old age and deep poisoning, he died without being rescued.

### Correspondence

To whom it may concern:

We are writing on behalf of our client, Madam Shi Wu, who states that: "I read a news item in the *Shen Bao* of the 8th of this month entitled 'Shi Lianfu, Owner of a Gunny Sack Shop, Shot.' The article vaguely stated that the shooting was due to his immense profits from managing a gunny sack shop, as well as hoarding rice. This has led the general public and relatives alike to mistakenly believe that patriotic individuals were punishing a treacherous merchant. Such rumors, spreading misinformation, are a great insult. My husband's name is Shi Lifu; various newspapers mistakenly reported it as Shi Lianfu. He was indeed shot near Wuding Road and Macgregor Road around 1 p.m. on the 7th of this month, but unfortunately succumbed to his injuries around 7 a.m. the following morning. The police have thoroughly investigated the matter and have been authorized to strictly pursue the perpetrators. I can confidently assert that it was definitely a vendetta. The rumors about him being a treacherous merchant hoarding rice are completely false. This matter concerns the deceased's reputation, and criminal law has special provisions for protection. Anyone who publicly insults the deceased should bear criminal responsibility. I request your law firm to send a letter to the *Shen Bao* on my behalf to publish a clarification."

Our firm is writing on her behalf as stated above. We request that your esteemed newspaper investigate and grant a clarification. Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,

Lawyer Zhang Danping

To whom it may concern:

Our client, Mr. Chen Zongdao, states that: "Yesterday, I read a news report that a university student was fraudulently issuing checks, which is inconsistent with the facts. Xi Shaofen's younger brother, Shaolian, Feng Ruizhang, and I are all classmates at Shanghai Law College. Since May 30th of last year, Feng Ruizhang has repeatedly borrowed more than a dozen checks from me, and Feng returned these by cash before their due date. However, two checks totaling 18,000 yuan due on December 28th were not returned. Upon inquiry, he said he needed to borrow two more to cover them. I then signed a check for 18,000 yuan dated January 5th of this year. Unexpectedly, after Feng took the check, all four checks were not returned around the due date. After repeated demands to return the checks were ineffective, Feng Ruizhang personally wrote a statement declaring that he would be fully responsible for any disputes arising from the borrowed checks. He also found a guarantor, responsible for returning the borrowed checks and compensating for all losses. Your esteemed lawyer has already submitted the evidence for review. Therefore, although I am the issuer of the checks, I am also one of the victims in fact. The French Concession authorities are only prosecuting under Article 226 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. However, your newspaper stated that I committed fraud, and that I frequented dance halls, wasted money, and could not make ends meet, which led to the issuance of the checks. This is not the true story, and it is related to my reputation. I request your lawyer to send a letter to clarify these statements." We are urgently sending a letter on behalf of Mr. Chen. It is hoped that a clarification is granted.

Respectfully submitted to the esteemed editor of the *Shen Bao*,

### Silk Prices Rise Slightly

The silkworm season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year is not as good as before. It is now time to decide on purchases, and it is estimated that the harvest will be no more than 40 to 50 percent of the usual amount. Therefore, new silk has not yet entered the market, and the price of old silk is already 22 to 23 yuan per hundred taels, which is higher than last year.

### A Few Words Avert Theft

In Jinling, at the home of Dr. Yang Li'an in Nima Lane, someone knocked on the door around 10 PM on the tenth day of last month. The maid went to ask who it was, and the person said they needed the doctor. When the door was opened, a masked man holding a knife strode in. The maid tried to scream, but the man tapped her head with the back of the knife and said that if she screamed, he would cut her in two. He then closed the main door and proceeded into the inner room. Yang had two daughters who were chatting in the hall. Suddenly, they saw a masked man holding a knife enter, and they cried out that there was a thief. The elder daughter ran into her room, while the younger daughter ran out the back door, shouting for help. At that time, Yang was washing his feet in his room. Hearing the cries of "thief," he immediately stood up. He saw a man holding a knife enter the room. Yang said to him, "Why did you have to mask your face to come here?" Yang meant that he was not a wealthy household, so why did the thief have to mask his face to rob him? These were words of entreaty. Unexpectedly, the thief mistakenly thought that Yang had recognized his appearance, so he turned around and left. However, he repeatedly slashed the doorframe with his knife, as if to indicate that he would cut anyone who came after him. When the neighbors heard the cries, they came to help, but the thief was nowhere to be found. All they saw was Yang's family, men and women, sitting or standing, all silent and motionless, their eyes unblinking, looking like clay sculptures or wooden carvings, as they had all been scared out of their wits. Alas! How dangerous!

Spring and Autumn

### A Glorious Memorial for Mr. Zhang Yunhe

— Wang Yizhi, sent from the Netherlands

Entrusted with history like the paulownia leaf, adorned with plum blossoms in the scholarly world, he followed in the footsteps of the Premier, plotting for the country. Colleagues all admire Mr. Zhang's generosity.

Old dreams of autumn water shields, lingering sorrow like melting snow, he dedicated himself to the revitalization of the *Shen Bao*, after which, the kindness of the elder is still passed down through generations.

The mission of a newspaper is comparable to that of a good historian. In the *Shen Bao* Yearbook of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Shi Gongliang's words on talent were published, which are still valid today. *Shen Bao* is the oldest Chinese-language daily newspaper. It has been published for sixty-seven years, and the late Mr. Zhang Yunhe has dedicated himself to the newspaper for nearly forty years, occupying a large part of the past history of *Shen Bao*. He was meticulous and unwavering, and not only the entire staff of the newspaper admired him. I remember that twenty-nine years ago, the famous Shanghai publishing expert Mr. Xia Cuifang once said to me, "The newspaper business is very hard work. Fortunately, you are young, but I am afraid that after a few years, your strength will not be enough." However, Mr. Zhang Yunhe and the editors and compilers of the editorial department generally lived in the newspaper office and regarded the newspaper's affairs as their own. They not only enjoyed it but also felt at home. For decades, their life of "lighting lamps at the third watch and hearing the rooster at the fifth" continued day after day. This shows that Shi Gongliang's consideration of talent, generous treatment, and the perfect facilities of the new building have contributed to it. I have visited many large newspaper offices in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe, and I have seen that the reporters on the night shift are at most only two or three people. After 1 a.m., they generally swept the floor and closed the door. I sighed at the time-saving and labor-saving methods of running newspapers in the Western mechanical world, which is far beyond what ordinary people expect, and I deeply admire the self-esteem and perseverance of Chinese intellectuals. I believe that they are enough to represent the ancient civilization of the East and surpass all others in the world. On January 16th, President Chiang sent a telegram from Chongqing to encourage elementary school teachers across the country, saying: "I deeply appreciate that you are serving the country in school classrooms, and the greatness of your work is no less than that of officers and soldiers fighting on the battlefield." I respectfully offer my humble opinions and condolences to the late Mr. Zhang Yunhe, saying: "Scholars working in newspaper offices serve the society, and the grandeur of their careers is greater than that of ambassadors enjoying wealth and honor, and the burden they bear is no less than that of elementary school teachers and officers and soldiers who are steadfast and unyielding." Today, as the melting snow is on the southern branches and sad news spreads, remembering the past rules, I wrote a twenty-five-character couplet to express my love and respect.

### Stealing Books and Visiting Dance Halls

— Peng

Since tuition and book prices have increased, many appeals and reviews have been published in this journal. In fact, in this environment where everything is controlled and difficulties arise step by step, price increases are naturally unavoidable, but the speculators pushing the tide is also an undeniable fact. This applies to rice and coal; and it also applies to schools and booksellers.

Thus, two types of famine have been created on "isolated islands": hunger for food and hunger for knowledge.

The *Shen Bao*'s social news page on the 11th carried the following news: Sun Yukun, who claimed to be a student at Kaiming Middle School, stole four large volumes of economics and political science books from the Commercial Press on the 8th of this month, worth more than thirty yuan. He was caught by the library's inspectors and handed over to the police. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special Court. The defendant admitted that he could not afford to buy the books, but he loved the stolen books, so he stole them.

From this news, we can see that the extent of the hunger for knowledge among diligent students is as serious as the hunger of the general poor for food. However, there is still cheap flour and rice for sale, but it is too difficult to find a school and bookstore with affordable tuition and book fees!

Therefore, after we accidentally discovered this news about stealing books, we can imagine how many studious young people have been forced to "drop out of school"! "Stealing books" is as much a crime as "snatching rice." We do feel sorry for Sun Yukun, but his method was wrong. After he completes his detention, he may wish to go to libraries and other places to fill the knowledge he needs, or borrow books from teachers and classmates. An aspiring young man can overcome his difficulties through hard work. Just remember the shame that forced him to drop out of school and steal books; this shame will one day be washed away!

A studious young man steals because he cannot afford books, which can arouse people's sympathy, but stealing is always a kind of shame. However, many students are able to study comfortably in universities, but they would rather go to dance halls, spend money like water, and are unwilling to buy books to increase their knowledge. They waste money earned by their parents' sweat and blood, and waste time that is more valuable than gold. They only bear the title of university students in vain. In this great era, the youth are so depraved, is this not also a kind of shame?

### Improving the Old Apprentice System

— Zhu Kaiqing

I am a former apprentice. Although I have now escaped that life of suffering, I feel that I should seek some liberation for the apprentices who come after me so that their future can be brightened. Therefore, I sincerely appeal to the masters of the apprentices.

Apprentices must write a contract to the boss for three to five years, like a deed of sale, and within the prescribed learning period, they must obediently endure hardships and learn diligently under the boss's authority. Diligent learning is indeed the foundation of all careers, but after the apprentices enter the shop, there is no real opportunity to fully learn skills. Usually, they are doing things like washing rice, washing vegetables, and even doing lower-level work. Occasionally, in their spare time, the master reluctantly teaches them a little skill, but honestly, how much skill can they learn? I am afraid that in the master's loud scolding, even their souls will be scared away. This is how they live for three to five years, and then they are considered to have completed their apprenticeship. After the boss sets a monthly salary of two or three yuan, they must continue to work in his shop for another year or two to repay the master's kindness. They even have to host a few tables of banquets before they can tear up the contract and freely leave his shop. This system of binding apprentices is too cruel! The bosses certainly benefit a lot, but the apprentices' good youthful time is wasted and meaninglessly taken away by the shopkeepers. We can imagine that these ordinary skills do not require so many years. They can be quickly completed in a short period of one and a half years. This is not only beneficial to the bosses, but also makes a great contribution to society. Therefore, I advise the bosses not to be selfish. They must train apprentices according to the needs of society. This will definitely have good results for both parties. As for improving the old system, there are already examples of modern factories and large shops treating trainees that can be imitated.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 21: Managing Economic Principles, Mixing Fibrous Substances, Using Machinery to Aid the Achievement of Literary Merit

Shao Huai called Qu Wushuang, and Qu Wushuang said, "Okay! Sister Huihua! I'll come right away." In less than three minutes, she came. The sisters all wanted to see our newspaper office. Because they see the newspaper every day, black words on white paper, flying around in the market, but they don't know how you guys make it. Let's guide them to see a rough outline. We don't need to alarm the people in each department, just the two of us can guide them. The sisters can just take a quick look. Shall we start from the bottom floor?" Qu Wushuang said, "Very good!" Then they took the elevator to the machine room on the lowest floor. This was a large, spacious room, which could be considered a semi-basement. Inside, there were fourteen rotary printing presses. Among these fourteen rotary printing presses, four were American-made, and the remaining ten were produced by Chinese machine factories. In the early years of China's post-war reconstruction, other products were still good, but in terms of machinery, China had to rely on imported goods. Therefore, China often exchanged silk, tea, tung oil, and various agricultural products with various countries for machinery. Later, China's iron mines gradually opened up, and more machine factories were established. Many people who studied mechanical engineering abroad also returned to China. Not only could many machines be imitated from Europe and America, but they could also be designed and create more convenient new models. Therefore, the rotary printing presses used to print newspapers are now made in China. However, the ten rotary printing presses are of different models, because the newspaper office did not purchase them all at once, but gradually added them over time. Each time they purchased a new one, they changed the model, which also gradually improved. These twenty-four rotary printing presses are connected into four major camps. All the printed newspapers have a whole roll of paper placed on the machine, and in just a moment, they are folded neatly. Copies of newspapers are pushed out like waves. This group of sisters arrived at the machine room at 5:45 PM, but they saw that many machines were silent and motionless. Only a very small number of machines were printing the last edition of the evening paper. It turned out that this newspaper office also published evening papers. The evening paper is published three times a day, once at 4 PM, once at 5 PM, and once at 6 PM. Although it is called three times, it does not really change its appearance much, only slightly revised. Because after the evening paper is published at 4 PM, there are still various telegrams arriving from various places after 4 PM, so the important news is added to the following two editions. (249)

### Lament for High Prices in New Shanghai (Part 1)

— Tu Shouzhuo

In this era of chaos and confusion, where right and wrong are reversed, prices soar, and a great wind sweeps through, striking the dying common people. Remember these folk rhymes, and feel the endless emotions.

The elite protect and receive honor, monopolizing and hoarding, unwilling to release their goods. Rice is over fifty yuan per stone. How can ordinary people fill their stomachs?

Coal briquette prices are unprecedentedly high. It is difficult to prepare cooked food in this country. Five cents for five, how can one slowly start a fire? Southern people's love for sweets has not changed, and they still value sweetness and flavor. The price of a jade basin is no longer comparable to before. A catty of sugar costs six jiao.

Cotton yarn merchants are good at speculation, following others' footsteps swiftly. A chi of Ge linen sells for seven jiao, making common clothes more expensive than silk.

Cooking oil is the third most important thing when opening the door. It is difficult to save on cooking oil. Different foods, raw vegetables, and beans, each cost over a hundred yuan per hundred catties.

Every night, I go to the market to buy cheap wine. A small amount in a half-catty pot costs two cents. Compared to the price of the past, it is more than doubled!

The merchants still say the price is low. Five yuan buys a chicken. This scares poor people. Forget about killing a chicken to entertain guests!

Wearing cloth shoes all year round, worth ten yuan, a foreign brand. The price changes three times each, and the quality is still worse than before.

Every household keeps vigil with double red candles, burning inch by inch into ashes. This year, the price of candles is three times higher than before, ten jiao per ten taels.

For ancestral offerings during the New Year, burning silver foil is a traditional custom. Each stack of a thousand sheets, arranged in a "nine-nine" string, costs three yuan and three jiao, a new price.

The price of meat at the end of the year is shocking. One and a half yuan per market catty. Four cents buys sliced ham, thin as autumn clouds.

It is difficult to find delicious food. Green tea is better than chicken and pork. Who would believe it if they hadn't seen it with their own eyes? Each four market catties sell for one yuan.

Every day, I sigh at the poverty of my spotted bamboo pen. The price of pens is high, making it difficult to buy them. What is the price of a sheep's hair brush? Three jiao per piece, and the quality is still simple.

Children have other snacks to eat for leisure. Fragrant beans and peanuts cannot be omitted. At least two cents in a paper bag, not enough to chew heartily and not smile.

### Condolences for Cai Yuanpei

— Hu Shanyuan

The world praises the wise man Wang Anshi, everyone weeps for the scholar Su Shi.

### Citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven (Part 2)

Like this person, with learning, cultivation, everyone believed in his morality. Everyone envied his respectability, everyone acknowledged his broad knowledge of the Bible, and he himself believed that he was a first-class citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus acknowledged his achievements, but solemnly told him that he was not yet close to the Kingdom of Heaven, and that he must continue to work hard. Again, a wealthy young man walked to Jesus and asked Jesus a big question, "What should I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus replied, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength. Second, love your neighbor as yourself. This is the greatest commandment in the law." The young man said calmly and humbly, "I have kept these commandments from my youth." This is the truth, not bragging. He had walked a long way to the Kingdom of Heaven, but Jesus told him that he still had to work hard. Jesus said, "There is still one thing you have not done. You must go and sell all your possessions and give to the poor." When the young man heard this, he felt very sad and left, because he had many possessions. And the path to true joy and happiness was blocked by his possessions. The two people mentioned above were not far from the Kingdom of Heaven, but they stopped and did not go any further. Therefore, today we must recognize the true qualifications for being citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven. We cannot be "almost" Christians, nor can we be "almost" good people. Today is a scientific world, and everything emphasizes precision. Six sixes are thirty-six, which is mathematical precision, and will never vary due to friendship. No matter what psychology, it cannot change it. The same is true for other music, chemistry, and physics. Jesus believes that religion is also the same, with great laws governing it. Musicians do not think that the harmony of music limits their freedom, but it guides them to the ultimate peak of beauty. Engineers abide by the rules of their profession, and then the machines will operate in a certain pattern. Similarly, we may not easily follow the laws that govern the conduct of people in the world, but they can make our lives reliable. All moral and spiritual limitations are to make our morals progress and protect us from falling. These laws are the boundaries of the Kingdom of Heaven, and they are also the qualifications for being citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven. (To be continued)

### The Singing Postures of Chinese Movie Stars

— Ji Yan

Since the advent of sound films, almost all female movie stars can sing. Now I will write about the singing postures of several well-known female movie stars:

Hu Die and Chen Yanyan stand steadily and quietly. After singing, they show no particular expression and are extremely humble, with a style that is very much that of well-bred ladies. The tone of the two is particularly broad and high, so any tone, whether high or low, is never a problem for them.

Li Lili sings and plays casually, as if nothing is happening. After singing, if she feels satisfied, she jumps with both feet. Otherwise, she shouts, "That doesn't count! That definitely doesn't count!"

Chen Yunshang and Li Minghui are like monkeys in the mountains and orioles in the sky when they sing, full of vigor, just like children. But when they are quiet, they are as silent as researchers. Sometimes they have to attend to other people's conversations while singing. Their five senses and four limbs work at the same time, but they never sing the wrong notes.

Li Lilian said, "Recording a record is as painful as giving birth, but after recording it, it is as refreshing as if I had given birth." Indeed, because the songs she sings are all very fast and difficult tunes, and the music is particularly complex. Only she can handle it.

Hu Shan is so cheerful and straightforward. As soon as she arrives, without even opening her mouth to sing, she sends a symbol of "universal joy" and "peace in the world."

Gong Qiuxia still retains the demeanor of a child. She likes to sing children's marches the most. Before singing, she must give a child-like smile to the friends around her. When she sings happily, she sticks out her tongue. When she is unhappy, she frowns.

Tan Ying's singing is as expressive as her acting, with her eyebrows, eyes, mouth, hands, waist, legs, and feet all helping out.

All of the above-mentioned stars always use their fingers to mark the beats when they sing. The weight of the beats and the intonation of the tune are expressed on their fingers.

### After Watching "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom"

— Hua

The rise of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" was the prelude to the Chinese national revolution. Due to the corruption of the Qing government at the time and the suffering of the people, this explosive revolutionary spark started from the Jintian Village uprising and went all the way down. It can be said that it was unstoppable. However, after establishing Nanjing as the capital, they were content with the current situation and fell into the contradictions of "divine power." The suspicion and jealousy among the four kings deepened the difficulties of the battle. After Li Xiucheng's proposal to move the capital was rejected by shortsighted people, he could only lead his brothers and sisters, who "could take them to a way of life," to be trapped in a "dead city." Although Li Xiucheng failed, it is not an excuse for defeatists. His failure was determined by historical conditions. In the first act, the playwright fully explained the pros and cons of moving the capital, but Li Xiucheng, in order to be loyal to the imperial court and deeply love the children in the city, could only fight more bravely and arduously, hoping that the reinforcements from Huzhou would be able to relieve the difficulties of Nanjing. His death will inspire countless Li Xiucheng's to rise up one after another.

Therefore, "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom" is the same as "Regret Over the Ming Dynasty." What the playwright tells us is a lesson: a comparison between betrayal and loyalty. Ge Nenliang's death after scolding the rebels and Li Xiucheng's righteous spirit are exactly the examples we need now.

"Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom" is divided into four acts: In the first act, Li Xiucheng insists on moving the capital; in the second act, the people in the city cooperate to defend it to the death; in the third act, the people continue to make persistent efforts; and in the fourth act, Li Xiucheng generously gives his life. Although the writing is quite rough, the rendering of Li Xiucheng's wisdom and courage and the reasons why the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" failed are still meticulous. What is even more lovable is the three cups of wine that Li Xiucheng raises in the fourth act, which is touching and makes people cry.

Yan Jun's Li Xiucheng is calm and firm, and his enunciation is clear. Compared with Wu Sangui, he has made more progress.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Remembering Liu Hongsheng's Sudden Death (Part 1)

Back then, besides Wang, Tan, and Sun, there were also the Wang Xiaonong and Liu Hongsheng schools of old male role (xusheng) performance. They were once very popular in major cities across the country. While they generally followed Gui Fen's singing style, they were known for writing their own new plays and incorporating fast tempos and flowing melodies. Therefore, his performances in Shanghai caused quite a sensation. The performers in Shanghai have always been happy to support famous performers from the south; when Xiaonong was with the Dan Gui First Stage, he once sang "Zhang Song Presents the Map," and even had Luo Xiaobao, San Mazi, and Feng Zhikui play the insignificant roles of Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei in the play. This, of course, attracted more audiences and increased Xiaonong's value. In addition, there was Liu Hongsheng's performance of the "Complete Empty City Stratagem" at the Great Stage. Apart from Mei Rongzhai, who he brought as a supporting actor, being unremarkable, the strangest things were Zhao Ruquan's cross-dressing as the old soldier and Yao Junqing's portrayal of the messenger. Because the audience was so large that time, I arrived late and bought two stage-side seats to hear more clearly. Fortunately, Liu the Lame's acting had nothing to offer, and most listeners focused on his good voice. Dozens of stage seats were directly facing the city tower, so it was truly clear.

Hong Sheng originally sang Black Face roles, and it was Mu Fengshan's guidance, obtained from selling small knives, that made him abandon business for performance. Later, he got the nickname "Little Knife Liu," and this was the reason. When he came to Shanghai to perform, Li Chunlai greatly despised him as a person, and his share of the roles was particularly small. At that time, he was really down and out. Not long after, the troupe suddenly lacked an old male role, and no one could replace him. A friend among his colleagues who was close to Hong Sheng knew that he had privately studied old Tan's style in Beijing. "Empty City Stratagem" and "Hongyang Cave" were indeed full of flavor, and at the same time, he could also handle several Wang Mao plays such as "Beating the Golden Branch" and "Jinshui Bridge" in one go. So, he suggested it to Chunlai, and he was replaced, and surprisingly, the show was a sell-out and very popular. From then on, his value rose, and his roles became longer. However, Chunlai could no longer keep him. After returning north, he almost competed against old Tan. Those who wanted to hear the flavor went to old Tan, and those who wanted to hear the voice all went to Liu the Lame. From then on, he never touched his Black Face roles.

### Zhou Jianyun Talks About Recent Film Industry

— Haixing

Mr. Zhou Jianyun was the former manager of the Star Film Company. He determined the production direction of the Xiansi Temple, and opened up overseas distribution channels. Mr. Zhou was truly a distinguished contributor in the process of the Chinese film industry's development from its infancy to its current scale. After the war, he retired to his hometown and has had no activities. Recently, the reporter met Mr. Zhou and asked about the current state of the Chinese film industry. His reply was as follows: (1) The box office revenue of domestic films after the war is truly unprecedented. It is now commonplace for a new film to earn 40,000 to 50,000 yuan during its first-run release. Even second and third-run theaters often exceed the first-run theaters' revenue before the war. Before the war, except for films like "Sister Flowers" which had particularly good box office revenue, the average income of a film in Shanghai was about 20,000 yuan. Compared to now, the difference is very, very large. As for other cities, because the currency prices in the Philippines and Hong Kong have risen, the income of producers has also greatly increased. Although raw materials have also risen at the same time, the production time has been shortened and efforts are made to save money everywhere, so there is a surplus compared to before the war. (2) The popularity of costume dramas is due to the fact that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia welcome these works. At present, some costume dramas seem to be a bit too sloppy. If this continues, putting aside everything else, even in terms of business, I am afraid it will be difficult to sustain. When he said this, Mr. Zhou looked extremely regretful.

### Theater News

— Xiang

Since the Shanghai Art and Drama Society announced its establishment, actors such as Qin Lian, Tao You, Chen Zhong, Xue Rong, and Huang Fang from Guohua Film have joined, making the cast quite impressive. On the 17th of this month, they will be invited by the Lone Army Drama Troupe to perform for the second time. They may officially perform in mid-next month.

### Leisurely Sketches Inviting the Arts (27) String Music

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Youyan

String music has two types: "Danxian" (single string) and "Sanxian" (three strings). It is certainly very difficult to play operas encompassing sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted-face male), and chou (clown) roles on a few unchanging strings! Because it sounds a little monotonous, in recent years, "string music" performances are often accompanied by a young girl's clear singing.

Most string music performers are blind. Being careless and impetuous will definitely not work for this skill.
