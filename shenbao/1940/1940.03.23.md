### Victory Reported by Donghua Army in Lingshan; Recapture of Nanxiang, Lemingwei, and Other Places; Japanese Army Suffers a Crushing Defeat in One Day and Night, Retreating in Two Directions; Severely Cut Off the Eastward Supply Line from Yongqin Road, Suffering Heavy Losses

Binyang: Japanese troops invading the northeast, Nanxiang, and Pingnan areas of Lingshan were encircled and suppressed by the Chinese army on all sides. After a fierce battle for one day and night, countless Japanese corpses were left behind. By noon on the 21st, the Japanese forces broke through in two directions and fled in defeat. One force attempted to attack west of Lingshan but was intercepted by the Chinese. The Japanese troops lacked the will to fight and fled toward the Yongqin line, retreating southward. The Chinese army is in pursuit. Nanxiang, Jiangkou, Pingnan, Pingshan Lemingwei, and other places have been recaptured. No trace of the Japanese can be found near these locations. (22nd dispatch)

Details of Japanese Army Annihilation on the South Bank of the Yu River

Chongqing: Since mid-month, the Japanese army on the south bank of the Yu River and east of the Yongqin Road began to stir. Chinese troops from all directions responded with their strongest posture, launching extremely fierce division and combined attacks, fully unveiling a fierce battle. After a week of bloody fighting, the Japanese forces were greatly weakened, and the Chinese army gained an absolutely superior position. Authoritative sources revealed that within the next few days, the Chinese army will annihilate all Japanese troops, and the situation will be clearly established. Regarding the Japanese army's agitation, the process of annihilation, and the current situation, a military spokesperson told a Central News Agency reporter the following: On the 15th, the Japanese on the south bank of the Yu River and east of the Yongqin Road divided into two routes, followed by three routes, and advanced eastward. The first route, starting on the 13th, crossed the south bank of the Yu River and advanced to Liuwei via Pujin. The next morning, Chinese and Japanese forces engaged in an encounter battle, and the main Japanese force was defeated. They then divided into two routes and advanced eastward, one continuing along the river, one rushing towards Yongchun, and the main force advancing rapidly towards Jiangkou. The Chinese army, from both banks of the Yu River, ambushed the Japanese forces near Yongchun, clearing out the remaining Japanese forces in the vicinity. Upon reaching Jiangkou, the Japanese forces were also under Chinese siege. One route invaded Taiping from Liuwei, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese army. The Chinese, with their strong forces, defeated the Japanese in one fell swoop. The Japanese rear was cut off, preventing their westward escape. They then continued to advance east toward Shaping. The Chinese army continued to pursue, forcing the remaining Japanese forces to Nanxiang. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. At this point, the Japanese were like turtles in a jar, trapped in a tight Chinese encirclement. The second route of the Japanese, along the southern end of the Yongqin Road, advanced from Niugang to Luwu on the 14th. On the 17th, they advanced to Niulushan near Lingshan and were heavily surrounded by the Chinese army and severely attacked. The Japanese then reinforced heavily. A portion detoured to Fozixu and entered Lingshan city on the evening of the 17th, immediately engaging in street fighting with the Chinese army. Since that day, the situation in Lingshan County has been unclear. It is judged that the fighting in the four suburbs of the city is most intense. It seems that neither the Japanese nor the Chinese have any troops inside the city. By noon yesterday, the Chinese came from behind to attack and drove most of the Japanese to the mountainous area northeast of Lingshan, where they are being annihilated. The Chinese army has gained control of the main battlefield. The lives of the Japanese troops in all directions are in Chinese hands. Since the beginning of the battle east of Yongqin Road, the Chinese army west of Yongqin Road has launched attacks on the Japanese forces near Nanning day and night on two fronts. At the same time, the Chinese forces on both sides of the highway concentrated their attacks on the Japanese forces on the Yongqin Highway. They have recently recaptured key points such as Shibaizhai and are continuing to attack other strongholds to cut off the only transportation line for the Japanese army in Guinan. In summary, from the surface observation of the battle situation, it seems that the Japanese have gained an advantage. However, upon reviewing the overall situation, the Japanese have indeed shown an irreversible decline. The Japanese initially attempted to carry out a so-called "sweeping operation," but unexpectedly encountered Chinese suppression and annihilation everywhere, losing all their support, sinking deeper and deeper, making it increasingly difficult to extricate themselves, and suffering severe blows from both the front and rear.

Editorial

### How to Strengthen the Control of Special Products

"Those who gain the Way receive much help, while those who lose the Way receive little help." The vastly different international situations of China and Japan are by no means accidental. Recently, China has obtained a loan of 20 million US dollars from the United States. This is naturally due to China's resistance, which is a just act of self-defense and also contributes to the protection of international common justice, thus gaining the sympathy of the United States. It is also due to the fact that China, in the midst of great difficulties, is still able to faithfully and diligently fulfill its obligations regarding the previous loan of 25 million US dollars, cherishing credit and demonstrating China's commitment to international justice, which makes the United States happy to provide assistance. However, the future is long, and China must strengthen its strength in wartime and complete its nation-building after the war. It must not only cultivate and develop its inherent abilities but also rely on the assistance of friendly European and American countries. Therefore, it is imperative to recognize this basic policy and effectively promote it in economic policy. Among them, measures related to international trade are likely to yield direct, significant, and rapid results. For example, the National Government has entrusted specially established agencies to handle the export of tung oil, tea, mineral sand, and pig bristles, respectively, to emphasize accountability. The significance of this is to adapt the country's main export products to the international market and to maintain the credit of international debt without regret. Economic activity must be sound and efficient. Strengthening the effectiveness of product control in this way is the necessary management of a wartime economy.

The purpose of control is to concentrate products and distribute them in an orderly and organized manner, to consolidate foreign exchange resources to prevent them from being scattered, to manage the resources of the war zone to prevent them from being leaked, and to strive to guide farmers and workers to improve their production methods and promote their production efficiency to seek a bumper harvest of products. The complexity and detail of this type of administrative work cannot be overcome by general administrative agencies. At the same time, observing Japan's recent actions in China, it seems that they are also focused on economic destruction and the plunder of resources. Therefore, all kinds of products in the occupied areas, such as silk, tea, hemp, cotton, coal, iron, mineral sand, eggs, pig bristles, and leather, are all taken by cunning and force under the name of control. They are either used for their own purposes, hoping to realize their desire to support the war with war, or exported overseas to obtain foreign exchange, hoping to obtain the materials they need to save their domestic depletion. They are pervasive, taking every detail, and vying for every profit. If they cannot win in the competition, they resort to destruction. Since the strict prohibition of private goods entering the mainland, there have been countless petty and cruel acts of searching and extortion everywhere. Even in terms of their military actions, such as the blockade of the Zhejiang coast, the forced crossing of the Qiantang River, the spying and threatening outside Tokyo Bay in Guangdong, the invasion of Nanning, the struggle for the Qin Yong Highway, the bombing of the Dian Yue Railway, and even the attempt to enter Shaanxi via the Yellow River to plot the Northwest; the attempt to open up Xiang E to compete for tungsten production in southern Jiangxi; although very few of these military actions have succeeded, and instead resulted in the loss of generals and soldiers, their significance lies not in military but in economic competition and destruction, which is clearly visible. In response to Japan's strategy, what China should strive to compete with is not only to protect domestic products but also to find ways to seize the resources of the occupied areas for its own use, or at least to prevent them from being used by the Japanese. There is no other way than to intensify control efforts.

Seizing resources is a war above modern military warfare, which is extremely difficult. If handled improperly, it will be ineffective. Moreover, the resources to be seized are located near the war zone or in the occupied areas. If one is not careful, it will be like birds flocking to a bird of prey or fish flocking to an abyss, which will harm the country and the people, and will only give others opportunities. Weighing the pros and cons, seeking practical results and preventing abuses, it is necessary to take into account both the great righteousness of the national crisis and the constant feelings of the common people. If one goes against the constant feelings and only talks about righteousness, many abuses will arise and it will be difficult to achieve significant results. Take the price as an example; at present, general prices are rising, and the cost of living is increasing accordingly. Therefore, the purchase price in the production area should not be suppressed too low, so that producers can benefit. In addition, if there is a surplus of goods used to repay foreign debt, the remaining amount should also be allowed for merchants to operate to some extent. Merchants who collect products from the occupied areas and transfer them to the mainland should be provided with convenience if they are for the convenience of the people in the mainland, and should be encouraged if they are sufficient for military use or can be prepared for export. However, those who manipulate and hoard should be cracked down on, but they should still be allowed to obtain the profits they deserve, so that both sellers and consumers can obtain practical benefits. For example, silk and tea are the main agricultural products of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Soon, new tea will be on the market, followed by silkworm cocoons, which are coveted by Japan and want to monopolize them. The Chinese authorities will not sit idly by and watch their prosperity and decline, but will urgently seek effective and beneficial control!

### Pittman Suggests US Senate Allocate Funds to Aid Chinese Refugees, Says China Has More Starving Refugees Than Poland

Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman said in the committee today that after approving the 10 million US dollar relief fund for Poland, we must then consider similar appropriations for China, Finland, or even Spain. "The government must not favor one over the other and be biased. Our current problem is whether we will choose one item to help or treat everyone equally without any distinctions, because in terms of needing relief, the number of refugees on the starvation line in China is actually more than in Poland and any other country, but no one even mentions it." It is reported that in Poland, American relief efforts have made considerable progress. American food, clothing, and medicine have all been granted permission by Germany to be supplied to the Polish people. (Reuters, 21st dispatch)

### Japanese House of Representatives Discusses Relations with the United States, Believes Situation is Serious

Hong Kong: Tokyo news, at a meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives yesterday afternoon, a certain member raised a question, saying that the United States recently loaned 20 million yuan to China and implemented a plan to expand the navy. In July of last year, it unilaterally declared the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. All these actions are undoubtedly expressions of the US government's hostility towards Japan. What countermeasures does the government plan to take in response to this international situation? At that time, Foreign Minister Arita was absent, and Koyama, a resolution official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, replied on his behalf, saying that the situation was indeed very serious, and it was extremely difficult to explain the specific methods. Regarding this major issue, although I do not want to make any specific statements, I believe that the United States' attitude of assisting the Chongqing National Government will make the "China Incident" difficult to resolve at an early date. Since the United States' attitude is like this, the government should naturally take a firm attitude, which goes without saying. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be decided solely by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc. (22nd dispatch)

### American Reporter Young Sentenced to Imprisonment, Suspended for Three Years

Hong Kong-Tokyo: The Young case was heard at 10:15 a.m. on the 22nd. Judge Horita announced that Young fabricated and spread rumors and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for three years. Before sentencing, the judge explained the details of the case, saying that Young's dispatches in Hong Kong and Tokyo were extremely unfavorable to Japan, violating Article 99 of the Army Criminal Law. The statements he made in court and to the prosecutor, as well as various evidence, further confirmed his criminal behavior. Based on Young's past experience and background, he knew that his behavior violated the criminal law, so he should be sentenced to six months of imprisonment. However, because Young is an American citizen and, according to his country's laws, the people enjoy absolute freedom of speech, and because he is serving in the press, the defense lawyer's opinion was to suspend the sentence for three years. Yokohama University of Commerce Professor Ogata served as the translator during the sentencing. Young's wife, Tokyo Youth Association Secretary-General Delkin, and a secretary from the US Embassy were all present to listen. (22nd dispatch)

### Constitutional Government Discussion Conference Discusses Gender Equality Issue, Liu Qingyang Says Final Victory Belongs to Women

Chongqing: At yesterday's constitutional government discussion conference of various parties and factions, Ms. Liu Qingyang, the representative of the guerrilla defeat area in North China stationed in Chongqing, declared that the final victory between men and women will surely belong to women. According to yesterday's conference, the issue of gender equality was discussed. During the debate, Luo Wengan advocated that men and women should not be equal, while Liu Qingyang advocated equality. Her reason is that most men in the world tend to oppress women, and women with strong personalities have no choice but to resist. The long-term resistance of Chinese women to male oppression is exactly the same as China's current long-term resistance to Japanese aggression. Since China will surely win the final victory in the war against Japan, the final victory in the war between men and women will surely belong to women as well. (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)

### Military Authorities of Britain, France, and Turkey Discuss Military Cooperation in the Near East, Important Meeting Held in Syria, Hopes for Peace in Europe Are Slim

Istanbul: According to a dispatch from Ankara, Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff General Montzi will hold talks with Allied commanders in Alippo today to discuss cooperation between the Turkish, British, and French armies and cooperation within the framework of the Tripartite Pact. It is generally believed that this meeting is a continuation of the meeting previously held by the three-nation commanders in Ankara. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)

Amsterdam: British troops in the Near East are missing General Wavell, who flew to Cairo from South Africa yesterday. (Haineng dispatch on the 22nd)

Angora: Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the former British Ambassador to China and current British Ambassador to Turkey, plays a key role in the current concentration of military cooperation among Britain, France, and Turkey in the Near East. Hughe has now gone to Syria at a time when Allied military authorities in the Near East and a Turkish military mission are holding a meeting there. Although Hughe's trip is said to be a "travel" nature, well-informed sources believe it is related to the military meeting. This is the first time since the outbreak of the European war that Turkish military leaders have left the country to go to the Near East to meet with British and French military authorities. Therefore, it is generally believed that it is noteworthy. Turkish officials here believe that the total resignation of the French cabinet, the brewing of a reorganization of the British cabinet, and the recent meeting of the heads of the Axis powers all make European peace hopeless. Local newspapers also said that all of this is the "prelude to the formal start of the war." Turkish officials pointed out that the resignation of the French cabinet will intensify military activities on the Western Front, while the Near East will see a relaxation in contrast. The Austrian opinion here said that the rumors of peace are very strong, but according to reports from London and Paris, Britain and France will never make peace until their goals are achieved.

### Germany and Italy are brewing a Three-Party Alliance with the Soviet Union, Seeking Closer Diplomatic and Economic Cooperation

London: Speculation in Europe is now focused on the rumor from the Swedish capital that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit Berlin during Easter. According to Beijing Radio, political circles in Berlin believe that after Hitler and Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass, there will soon be "another important diplomatic manifestation." However, senior Nazi officials today dismissed rumors that some kind of tripartite alliance between Berlin, Rome, and Moscow will soon be concluded. According to a "Gibellga News" reporter, "Such speculation is still premature." (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)

London: Observers here have recently stated that the idea of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union approaching each other was generally considered unlikely to materialize some time ago, but it has now become an assumption that should be taken into account and may be realized, forming the center of the crisis, which should be prepared for in advance. When the leaders of Germany and Italy met at the Brenner Pass a few days ago, Hitler persuaded Italy to approach the Soviet Union and clearly provided assurances that the Soviet Union would never provide guarantees to the Balkan Peninsula and threaten Italy. Although Mussolini did not give a definite answer or show delight at the time, he treated the matter with a tolerant attitude. He is seriously considering this matter and consulting his subordinates to gather ideas for a collective wisdom plan. From Italy's point of view, if Italy cooperates with Germany and the Soviet Union, it will also reserve a step for mediating the current war in the future. In this way, Italy will not engage in any military action with Germany and the Soviet Union in the Balkan Peninsula, but will only take joint action in diplomacy and economy to prevent this corner of Europe from being invaded by the forces of Britain and France. Regarding this matter, Italian observers generally said that Mussolini's actions will be based purely on realistic viewpoints in the future, and ideological viewpoints will be secondary.

### British Parliament Recesses for the Holiday, Reopens on April 2nd, Many Loopholes in the Blockade Line, Members of Parliament Urge the Government to Pay Attention

London: The British Parliament adjourned yesterday and will reopen on April 2nd. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)

London: Liberal Party MP Mandell and Conservative Party MP Bootsby mentioned the serious loopholes in the Allied blockade line when they proposed a motion for adjournment in the House of Commons last night. According to Mandell, the amount of cotton imported by various neutral countries in Europe has increased greatly since the war. In January of this year, the Soviet Union imported 200 tons of tin from Vladivostok, while there were no imports at all during the same period last year.

He heard that the German side now has hundreds of freight cars on this route for the transportation of raw materials. Mandell also suggested that action should be taken regarding the matter of Swedish pig iron being transported to Germany via Norwegian territorial waters, and said that Norway and Sweden's refusal to allow British troops to pass through to Finland violated the League of Nations treaty. Bootsby said that the amount of raw materials transported to Germany via Trieste and Genoa was too much. In response to the debate, Undersecretary Butler stated that the government is currently paying serious attention to the points raised by the two gentlemen, especially the cotton issue and trade via Vladivostok, which are being actively monitored. Regarding the obligations of Norway and Sweden under the League of Nations treaty, we must recall that the Scandinavian countries made various reservations at the time of the League of Nations' resolutions on sanctions. Butler also answered Bootsby's question, saying that if the public asks the neutral countries about the cooperation in Geneva in the past few years, he dares to assert that it will have the greatest effect. If we carry out this matter jointly with France, its effect will be even greater. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)

### Soviet Union Purchases Large Quantities of War Materiel from the United States, British Government Pays Close Attention

London: Economic Minister Kraus stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the Soviet Union is purchasing large quantities of war materiel from the United States. He heard that the Soviet Union's purchases of kerosene from the United States in the year ending March 31st were far more than the figures for 1938, but did not exceed the export volume of previous years. However, it can now be proven that the Soviet Union has purchased quite a lot of other war materiel from the United States, especially copper. The British government is constantly paying attention to this issue. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)

### German Aircraft Conduct Reconnaissance Activities off the Southeast Coast of Britain, Berlin Describes the Attack on a Convoy, British Say None of the Escort Vessels Were Damaged

London: It is heard that aerial activity off the southeast coast of Britain was very intense last night. German aircraft approached the coast, and British fighter planes and reconnaissance planes were seen flying in and out of the sea. Patrols of British fighter planes were quite active in a large area along the southern coast. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)

London: On Wednesday night, a British ship was bombed off the south coast. One bomb hit, killing five crew members. Four of them died on board, and the other died shortly after being sent to the hospital. According to an announcement from the Ministry of Aviation, an enemy aircraft appeared over Shetland yesterday afternoon. The air raid alarm was lifted fifteen minutes later. The aircraft sped away when it approached. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)

Berlin: According to German military reporter Taitman yesterday, when German aircraft attacked a British convoy on the 20th, reconnaissance aircraft first detected a British convoy passing near the British east coast. German fighter planes arrived a few hours later. The convoy included about 40 merchant ships, escorted by two or three cruisers, several destroyers, and many torpedo boats. After the convoy was bombed by German aircraft, it split into two teams, and many merchant ships lost contact with the convoy. German aircraft used the cover of the jet stream to fly low and drop bombs amidst heavy anti-aircraft fire, destroying many merchant ships, some of which were on fire. German aircraft continued the attack for more than an hour, stopping only when the weather deteriorated and it was almost dusk. During the bombing, British destroyers flew in to meet the attack. One German aircraft radio operator died. (Haitong dispatch on the 22nd)

London: The British Admiralty issued a statement at 9:20 last night, denying the German High Command's claim of a surprise attack on a British convoy and sinking "warships and nine merchant ships." According to the statement, the convoy was in fact almost entirely composed of neutral ships, was not dispersed, and is now sailing safely ahead. None of the escort vessels were hit or damaged, and no ships sank as the Admiralty has already announced. The attacking German aircraft were driven away by British naval aircraft, several of which were hit by bullets, and one was damaged. Three neutral ships were damaged. In addition, the British ship "North Coast" (1,211 tons) and the Norwegian ship "Eirlingdu" (1,281 tons) reported upon arriving in port today that the two ships were also damaged. The "armed merchant ship" attacked in the English Channel mentioned in the German communiqué was the British ship "Barnhill" (5,439 tons), which was not armed or escorted, and was hit by an incendiary bomb dropped by a German aircraft and caught fire, but it was extinguished. The ship is now in a safe place. Therefore, the German claim that 41,000 tons of ships were sunk yesterday is completely unfounded. The reason for this error may be due to the mental disturbance caused by the British aircraft's attack on the island of Sylt. The German claim that ships were damaged, totaling 11,000 tons, is not an overstatement, as the actual figure is 11,518 tons. Two small neutral ships, the Danish ship "Viking" (1,153 tons) and the "Bolier" (2,109 tons), were sunk by German submarines off the coast of Scotland yesterday. Of the 40 crew members, seven survivors were rescued. It can be seen that the Nazis vented their anger entirely on neutral ships yesterday, because neutral ships are unarmed and become the target of German bravery when they leave the convoy. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)

### Inspection After the Bombing of Sylt Island

Sylt Island: German and foreign reporters inspected Sylt Island, and were received with nostalgia by the German Air Force base in Hole Holm. Haitong News Agency reporter Rogerski described the inspection process as follows:

Sylt Island is connected to the mainland by the 11-kilometer-long Hindenburg Dyke. When the train passes through the dyke, it travels very slowly. The reporters got off the train several times, but did not find any traces of bombs. When the machine driver heard that British newspapers published the news that the Hindenburg Dyke had been bombed and caught fire, he was surprised, because the dyke is made of sand, stone, and cement, and cannot catch fire. The residents of Westerland, the capital of Sylt, are living and working in peace. Long trains are still parked at the station, ready to transport passengers to various parts of the mainland to spend the Easter holiday. The air force base in Holm only destroyed the roof of the army hospital, and there were no deaths or injuries, because the personnel in the hospital had taken refuge in the bomb shelter. Several other houses were also destroyed by British aircraft, but the people had taken refuge in air-raid shelters, and fortunately there were no deaths or injuries. However, the British aircraft did not achieve their goal of bombing the aircraft elevator of the German air force base. A crane nearby, although hit by an incendiary bomb, was not damaged. Currently, the aircraft at the air force base are all ready to take off and participate in future air battles. In total, about fifty or sixty bombs were dropped near the Holm air force base, and twenty bombs were also dropped farther away from the airfield. Thirty or forty bombs also fell into the sea. German destroyers did not engage in combat, and only used anti-aircraft artillery to shoot at them. A few. The central part of Sylt Island was also bombed by British aircraft, and a British aircraft was shot down in the northern part. The remains of the British pilot are scheduled to be buried today.

Therefore, with funding from the Norwegian embassy, the company sent the group of Chinese sailors back to China via the United States. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### French Reynaud Cabinet Announces Policy Platform Aims to Concentrate Power to Achieve Victory and Vow to Severely Crack Down on Communist Propaganda

Paris - Premier Reynaud addressed the Chamber of Deputies today after ten o'clock and read out the cabinet's policy platform, which broadly stated: France is currently engaged in a total war to confront a strong and determined enemy. This enemy has gained support due to the Soviet Union's betrayal and is currently fighting on all fronts in the hope of achieving victory. Its destructive power is immense, but it is also utterly detestable. Therefore, the current war is an all-encompassing gamble. If we fight and win, everything can be preserved. If we unfortunately lose, everything will be lost. This appalling reality should be understood by the Parliament representing the will of the people. The meaning of the current government's formation lies in creating strength, concentrating and leading it, so that it can be used to fight and achieve victory. It can also crush all acts of betrayal, no matter where they come from. Although the government's responsibilities are heavy, with the Parliament's trust and support, it will certainly be able to complete them. This confidence strengthens our spirit. If that is not enough, we only need to remember that our country possesses abundant resources, vast territory, respectable allies, courageous people, hardworking farmers and workers, a powerful army, brave soldiers, tactically skilled generals, and the immortal genius of the French people, and we can be reassured. (Havas, 22nd)

Paris - Premier Reynaud's policy declaration included the phrases "Soviet Union's act of betrayal" and "crush all acts of betrayal," which reportedly received warm applause from the Chamber of Deputies. When he finished speaking and stepped down from the podium, deputies from the left-wing and center parties all applauded in approval. Speaker Herriot then announced that Radical Socialist Party deputies Jallimont and Batier wished to raise questions regarding the cabinet reshuffle process, the government's general policies, and the war situation. Premier Reynaud also requested the Chamber of Deputies to immediately bring the matter to discussion. Jallimont was the first to speak, expressing surprise at the excessive number of positions and undersecretaries in the new cabinet. Socialist deputy Gache spoke to the point where the cabinet's policy platform addressed the Soviet Union, which he fully endorsed. He hoped that Premier Reynaud could explain the policy towards the Soviet Union in detail during a closed session of the Chamber of Deputies. Batier spoke next, largely agreeing with Jallimont's remarks regarding the potential hindrance to the crackdown on communist propaganda. Republican Democratic Union Party leader Marin then stated that France needs a war cabinet to cope with the current events abroad. Since the current cabinet is neither a wartime cabinet nor a cabinet of national unity, all deputies belonging to his party will unanimously vote against it. (Havas, 23rd)

### Reynaud Cabinet's First Meeting Establishes Wartime Affairs and Economic Committees with a Stronger Left-leaning Color

Paris - The Reynaud cabinet held a cabinet meeting at ten o'clock this morning, followed by a State Council meeting chaired by President Lebrun, which concluded at 10:45 a.m. The wording of the cabinet's policy declaration was then approved. (Havas, 22nd)

Paris - The number of members in the Reynaud cabinet is the same as in the wartime cabinet led by "Tiger Premier" Clemenceau during the previous Great War, but there are two novel features: First, there is a cabinet wartime affairs meeting, composed of Premier and Foreign Minister Reynaud, Associate Chautemps, Minister of National Defense and Minister of the Army Daladier, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac, Minister of Colonies Mandel, Minister of Finance Lamoureux, Minister of Blockade Monnet, and Minister of Armaments Dautry, for a total of nine members. It will meet three times a week. Second, there is a joint cabinet economic meeting, composed of the Minister of Finance and relevant economic ministers, which will meet at least once a week under the chairmanship of Premier Reynaud. (Havas, 21st)

Paris - Former Minister of Finance Reynaud belongs to the Independent Republican Party and is forming a cabinet for the first time. He has widely recruited talents from various parties. Among the new cabinet members, except for Minister of Armaments Dautry, who is a non-parliamentarian expert, there are six senators and six deputies from various parties (excluding undersecretaries). The Radical Party occupies six seats, the Left-wing Democratic Party occupies four seats, the Socialist Party occupies three seats, the Social Republican Union occupies three seats, the Republican Union occupies two seats, and the Independent Republican Party occupies three seats. (Havas, 23rd)

Paris - This time, only right-wing elements were not invited to participate in the new cabinet, which is quite important, because the government currently enjoys stronger support in Parliament than previous cabinets. Observers are now watching to see what actions the new cabinet will take to implement a strong war policy, as the new cabinet is scheduled to hold its first meeting. Reynaud has two aspirations in forming this new cabinet: one is a small-scale war cabinet, and the other is an all-powerful united cabinet including all parties. Although the Socialists have agreed to join the new cabinet, Blum has indicated that he does not wish to hold office. French newspapers have expressed regret over this, but said that it can demonstrate France's determination to pursue a vigorous war policy. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Parliamentary Groups Hold Separate Meetings to Decide Attitude Towards New Cabinet

Paris - The parliamentary groups of various parties in the Chamber of Deputies held separate meetings this morning to discuss the attitude they should take towards the new cabinet, so that they could follow it when the Chamber of Deputies votes on the motion of confidence in the government this afternoon. The Socialist Party has already decided to unanimously vote in favor of the government. The Republican Union Party seems to be giving up the right to vote, and three deputies of the party will explain this attitude. The Left-wing Republican Party and the Independent Radical Party decided to allow their deputies to vote as they please. The Left-wing Democratic Party adopted a reserved attitude. The decisions made by some party groups are still provisional and may change at the time of voting. In addition, most deputies of the Radical Socialist Party advocate abstention, but it is possible that they will hold another meeting after listening to Premier Reynaud's reading of the cabinet's policy platform. In short, Premier Reynaud does not belong to the Radical Socialist Party, so there is no unified action characteristic of the party when deputies vote. (Havas, 22nd)

Paris - After the establishment of the Reynaud cabinet, political figures have commented that the cabinet reshuffle was resolved very quickly, which is a good sign for the future political situation in France. The fact that Minister of National Defense and Minister of the Army Daladier remains in office will be effective due to his familiarity with the job, and the great responsibility borne by the previous cabinet in the military field, namely the responsibility of winning the war, can also be continued without interruption. In short, the general policy of the new cabinet should remain the same, and the establishment of a cabinet war affairs meeting is particularly sufficient to satisfy the parliament's desire to step up the war effort. Some observers said that the new cabinet's leaning color is stronger than the previous cabinet. How many votes it can get in the Chamber of Deputies will be determined after Premier Reynaud attends the Chamber of Deputies to read the policy platform and the Chamber of Deputies votes. It is estimated that, excluding most deputies of the Radical Socialist Party and most deputies of the central faction, the new cabinet can receive at least 215 votes in support in the Chamber of Deputies. (Havas, 21st)

### Two British Giant Passenger Ships Depart the United States for Australia to Undertake Troop Transport Duties

London - In the House of Commons yesterday, Conservative MP Lewis asked whether the government was considering selling the "Queen Mary" and "Queen Elizabeth" passenger ships to the United States, as the two ships seemed unsuitable for wartime use and the sale could obtain foreign exchange for wartime purposes. Shipping Minister Gilmour replied that he did not think it was appropriate to sell the two ships. It is reported that after the British Cunard Company's "Mauretania" sailed out of New York, the giant passenger ship "Queen Mary" also sailed away from New York. It is believed that the two ships are going to Halifax to be armed and then sail to Australia, presumably to undertake troop transport duties. (Reuters, 22nd)

New York - The French ship "Ile de France," which has been berthed in New York Harbor since September 9 last year, will also leave New York for other destinations, reportedly in connection with secret military affairs. The "Ile de France" is a famous giant ship with a displacement of 43,450 tons. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

### Swatow Japanese Army Attacks Jieyang in Two Routes then Retreats Fierce Battle Between Two Armies Before Huangqi Mountain Jieyang and Fengshun Turn from Danger to Safety

Swatow Correspondent - Outside the north gate of Jieyang, a river surrounds it, and a small stream passes through the city. One can take a boat across the Mayadu in the city. That place is the terminus of the Jiean Highway. At Mayadu there is a Fengjie Road, which enters Tangkeng via Xichang, entering the myriad mountains of Fengshun County. In previous civil wars, the ownership of the Chao-Mei region was entirely determined by the battle of Tangkeng in Fengshun. Tangkeng is the entrance to Meixian. The Fengshun mountains are strategically located, and from Tangkeng to Wuhua, Yuning, Meixian, Dabu, Chaoan, Jieyang, and Puning, the distances are equal, 120 Chinese miles. Rapid march by foot can reach it in a day. The Chinese army, aware of the importance of this place, had long ago deployed troops. The town gods in the upper reaches of the Han River also have strong positions, so that the Swatow Japanese army cannot attack upwards. Between the Jiean and Jiefeng roads is Huangqi Mountain. From outside the north gate of Jieyang, one can see the blue mountain color. On the mountain is the tomb of the female poet Chaoyun. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, she wrote a page of heroic history in Jieyang. Every spring and autumn, the women of Jieyang City must cross the river to Huangqi Mountain to pay homage to Chaoyun. The mountain is 12 Chinese miles away from Jieyang. In previous civil wars, those defending Jieyang had to defend this mountain. Wu Deze, commander of the 6th Reserve Division of the Chinese army, once stationed on Huangqi Mountain to ambush the invading Japanese army.

South Route - Starting from March 8, the Japanese army along the Chaoshan Railway divided into two routes, north and south, to attack Yangyang. The south route took Anbu as its base, commanded by Horiye, Kijima, and Hasegawa, and attacked in three routes. Shallow water ships, speedboats, cavalry, and battles were all complete. Each route had about 2,000 men, and there were also six aircraft, divided into two teams (three aircraft per team) taking turns to assist in the battle. Kijima's cavalry attacked Hailian Mountain and Shaxitou in front of Sangpu Mountain. The defender there was Wu Lixun's regiment of Hua Zhenzhong Brigade, engaging the Japanese elite between Xiaohangkeng and Shaxitoukeng, on the side of Hongan Township. Hasegawa's light infantry and the ambush of the Shantou Bridge and Yuepu of Anbu bypassed Pengzhou and Dayi, crossed Xiapu Mountain, and advanced on Chengwang in the Jieyang area. Horiye's unit took speedboats into Nanxi, occupied Nanpao City, forcibly captured laborers, and seized 50 sailboats to build a pontoon bridge in Nanxi, attacking Fengkou and Quxi. That place is 30 Chinese miles away from Jieyang City. The defender was Huang Guoxuan's unit of the 5th Security Regiment. Horiye also dispatched ten armored vehicles, attacking Chaoyang Guanbu, Guiyu, Fengshan, and Sangyuan. The Chaoyang Garrison Brigade of the Chinese side ambushed on the shore. Both sides fought fiercely for three hours. The Chinese army did not retreat. Moreover, on the evening of the 9th, the Chinese army dismantled the Tangpu pontoon bridge. Although 600 Japanese cavalrymen had scurried to outside the east gate of Jieyang, their rear route had been cut off. Japanese aircraft then dropped food packages to provide supplies. On the 10th, the Japanese troops in Pubei, Meilin Lake, Wujia, Nanpao and other places were gradually cut off by the Chinese troops and civilians from Sangpu Mountain, who went down the mountain to cut off their connection. The artillery, chariots, and cavalry under Hasegawa could not be used freely. Moreover, in the empty mountains and wilderness, the Chinese army could clearly see the Japanese soldiers wearing wool uniforms and the huge vehicles and cannons. The Chinese army could attack the Japanese army, but the Japanese army could not attack the Chinese army. The Japanese army made two resolutions to reinforce, but could not break through. Casualties reached 2,300. At this point, the Japanese army on the southern route could only retreat, instead charging northwest to the northwest of Fengkou and onto Denggang and Meigang, attempting to attack the Chinese army position on Huangqi Mountain and join forces with the Japanese army on the northern route, to spy on the Fengjie Road. This was on the 11th.

North Route - The Japanese army invading the north route consisted of three units: Goto, Tokuka, and Taura, who also attacked west in three routes. Wu Dawei's puppet army of more than 500 men cooperated with Goto's unit, attacking Denrong District and Guihu from the north of Yixi, superficially wanting to slant into Fengshun Tianzhuoyu. That place is a dangerous mountainous area. The Japanese army's nature was feigned attack to contain the Chinese army from going south. Another route started from the west gate of Chaoan, attacking Fengkou and Xitang via Aoding Mountain, Guxiang, and Datouling. This was the most elite of the Tokuka's troops, more than 2,000 men, with more machine guns than rifles. Another route set out from Fuyang and Wuyang, attacking Qingma Mountain, Fugang, Denggang, Dengtang, Dazhai, Wutou, and Yucong, flanking the Chinese army on the Anjie Road. This was the Taura unit, about 4,000 men. On the 10th, the Chinese army was forced to retreat to the Huangqi Mountain position, but fierce battles still occurred in the rear of the Japanese army, such as Denggang, Weishan, Lingtang City, Xitang, Aoding Mountain, and Qingma Mountain. More than 600 Japanese cavalrymen in Denggang were killed by the Chinese soldiers and civilians, with no one escaping. Also on this day, when the Chinese army recovered Guxiang Aoding Mountain Erfengxi, the Japanese army released poison gas in a big way, and only then was able to break out of Chaoan. On the 11th, during the fierce battle under Huangqi Mountain, tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians killed their way back to Jieyang from Chaoan and the Anjie Road, not only confronting Jieyang head-on, but also surrounding four or five thousand Japanese soldiers. In the northwest of Fengkou and on the west side of Sangpu Mountain, five Japanese troops were all surrounded by the Chinese calculations. The fierce battle lasted until noon on the 12th. The Japanese army was defeated, abandoning all vehicles, cannons, supplies, and corpses, and fleeing back along the Chaoshan Railway. More than 300 seriously wounded Japanese soldiers under Huangqi Mountain were unable to escape and were all captured alive. When the Japanese army retreated on the Anjie Road, they vented their anger on the people, firing at people and setting houses on fire. Forty or fifty large villages were turned into rubble. Since the battle under Huangqi Mountain, Jieyang has turned from danger to safety. About 200 puppet soldiers in Aoding Mountain and Denggang surrendered their guns. Fengshun and Mei Prefecture are both safe and sound. The rumors have subsided.

### International Relief for Zhe­dong Refugees: Establishment of Reception Centers and Congee Kitchens

Ningbo Correspondence: Since the outbreak of war in Xiaoshan, war refugees have been displaced and scattered throughout eastern Zhejiang. Most are suffering from hunger and cold, and are sleeping in the streets. Foreign residents in the Ningbo-Shaoxing area, such as Di­an­de, Zhou Da­lie, and Pei Ya­min, witnessing this tragic situation, joined local gentry and merchants in establishing the International Refugee Relief Committee in Ningbo this month. They obtained funding from the Shanghai American Relief Committee to handle various relief matters. In addition to setting up refugee reception centers and schools for orphaned children in Zhengxian, Zhenhai, Feng­bi, Xiangshan, Ci­xi, and Yuyao counties, they also, considering that Baiguan is located at a crucial transportation hub between Ningbo and Shaoxing and that starving people were gathering there, jointly negotiated with the Si­ming Red Swastika Society and the Shangyu County government to establish a congee kitchen in the town. Wang Qingsheng was appointed to take charge. Since its establishment more than a month ago, the county government has been responsible for purchasing and supplying rice each day. Refugees passing through have benefited greatly. However, rice prices are rising daily, and the necessary funds are affected by the European war and the possible suspension of American donations. The International Relief Committee can only provide a portion, and the local fundraising is also very limited. Mr. Wang, the person in charge of the congee kitchen, has been ordered by the sponsoring organizations to go to Shanghai to appeal to fellow villagers from Shaoxing for donations so that the congee distribution can continue.

### Ministry of Education Promotes Productive Education to Massively Train Technical and Health Personnel

(Chongqing Airmail) In view of the needs of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, the Ministry of Education has been diligently supervising and promoting productive education for the past three years, with the aim of training a large number of cadre technicians and health personnel. In higher education, 30 specialized training classes have been specially established. In the industrial field, there are nine classes in telecommunications, automobiles, mining, mechanized experimentation, papermaking, leather, dyeing and weaving, and agricultural product manufacturing. In the agricultural field, there are five classes in aquaculture, sericulture, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and agricultural economics. In the medical field, there are two classes in health engineering and health administration. In addition to establishing the National Central Vocational and Technical School, which has opened six classes, the remaining classes are distributed among public and private colleges and universities to utilize existing facilities. At the same time, it is stipulated that each specialized training class should establish close contact with production enterprises of the same nature and fully utilize their equipment for practical guidance. Teachers are also instructed to consider hiring specialists from relevant agencies to serve as part-time instructors. Furthermore, in order to meet wartime needs, in addition to approving the establishment of specialized departments and faculties in public and private colleges and universities, and planning to establish the National Northwest Vocational and Technical School, the National Xikang Vocational and Technical School, and the National Chongqing Merchant Marine School, the Ministry has also instructed Central University and other schools to establish ten additional classes in engineering and Sichuan University to establish one class in economics, with additional subsidies allocated separately. In addition, the Ministry has paid attention to the encouragement and improvement of provincial and private colleges and universities, allocating funds for subsidies on a regular basis. The distribution of these subsidies particularly emphasizes agriculture, industry, and medicine, stipulating that they should account for at least 70% of the total each year. In secondary education, the Ministry has formulated an outline for promoting agricultural and industrial vocational education in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, ordering the provinces to formulate implementation plans, adjust school settings, and stipulate methods for the provinces and cities to implement regional guidance for vocational schools, delineate vocational school areas, and designate colleges and universities to undertake guidance work to enhance the effectiveness of education. Recently, in addition to planning to allocate 400,000 yuan in funding to designated schools to run 32 vocational training classes in machinery, civil engineering, electrical engineering, telecommunications, surveying and mapping, printing, wool weaving, dyeing and weaving, sericulture, agricultural product manufacturing, accounting, midwifery, nursing, pharmacy, automobile repair, and oil manufacturing, it has also allocated funds under the central productive education fund to subsidize provinces and cities to enrich the equipment of vocational schools and to establish practical vocational schools at all levels. At the same time, the Ministry has also issued a circular to all provinces and cities stating that schools that do not receive central subsidies should have their funding increased by the provinces and cities, and the amount should not be less than the amount of the central subsidy. A summary of the intended use and expansion plan should be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval before it can be used, and the Ministry and provinces will send personnel to strictly supervise and inspect at any time, and it must not be diverted to other uses.

Gold, the chief writer for the English-language "Great American Evening News," recently published an article in the newspaper, continuing his impressions of visiting Chongqing. According to him, when he paid his respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the Chongqing headquarters, he saw that his physique and spirit were even more healthy and radiant than before. Those working day and night with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also have this impression. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek not only handles the busy official duties that ordinary people cannot handle, but also has a radiant spirit and is more optimistic than before. Chairman Chiang is afraid of those who visit him, but he seems happy to take the time to meet them. When meeting reporters, he always inquired in detail about the situation of the Shanghai press and the circulation of the "Great American Evening News." After a long time, the reporter bid farewell.

The More Difficult the Times, the Stronger the Confidence

The reporter had previously seen Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Wuchang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Henan. He felt that the more difficult the times, the more determined and calm his confidence became. He did not seem like a dictator. However, whenever he encountered work, he always had a plan in mind and dealt with it calmly. Chairman Chiang is afraid of those who visit him, but he seems happy to take the time to meet them. When meeting reporters, he always inquired in detail about the situation of the Shanghai press and the circulation of the "Great American Evening News." After a long time, the reporter bid farewell.

The Madam is Treating Her Nasal Disease in Hong Kong

Two days ago, when the reporter was in Hong Kong, he had tea with Madam Chiang Kai-shek, and he also found her to be as kind and amiable as before. Madam Chiang Kai-shek said that she had not been meeting guests recently because her nasal disease had not yet healed, so she came to Hong Kong for treatment. She is now eager to return to Chongqing because, although her work is being handled properly by someone else, she has received a letter urging her to return to Chongqing as soon as possible so that she can personally take care of everything.

All Members of the National Government Feel More Accomplished

Madam Chiang Kai-shek travels back and forth by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's private plane has been handed over to CNAC. During the war, he only travels back and forth on ordinary passenger planes. Madam Chiang Kai-shek's duties are as heavy as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's. The couple respect and help each other, and are in perfect harmony. In addition, all the key members of the National Government have been working hard for the past two and a half years, and they feel more accomplished than before.

Hongji and Haifeng Coal Prices Rise Again, Thorough Investigation, Manufacturers Plan to Make Special Coal Briquettes, Claiming They Are Different from Ordinary Coal Briquettes

The sources of various types of smoke-free white coal in Shanghai have been continuous recently, mostly from India and Annam. However, coal merchants are becoming active again, absorbing large quantities, causing white coal such as Hongji and Haifeng to rise again, about ten yuan per ton higher than at the beginning of this month. There are people hoarding coal, and a thorough investigation is needed to uncover the truth.

Briquette Factory Resolution

The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the factories under its jurisdiction have decided on the following: 1. Regarding the increase in the sales price of coal briquettes, from the 22nd of this month, the price of each ton delivered by sea will be 120 yuan in legal tender, and the retail price at the user's door will be 6 yuan and 4 jiao per dan, plus 2 jiao for delivery. 2. Regarding the provision of low-priced coal powder to help small coal briquette factories, in addition to the previous assistance, from April 1st to 10th, Yi Taixing Coal Shop will supply 500 tons, Da Longxing Coal Shop will supply 300 tons, and Tongcheng Company and Hancheng Foreign Firm will each supply 100 tons, for a total of 1,000 tons. 3. Regarding the sale of low-priced coal briquettes, which requires a change of location, it will be suspended for five days, and will continue for ten days from the 27th of this month. We hope you will take note of this.

Special Coal Briquettes

In addition, there is one more matter that must be reported to your association for the record, that is, the Oriental Coal Briquette Factory under our association stated in a letter that it is now planning to produce special coal briquettes, using only special-grade and grade one coal powder as raw materials. However, the cost is higher, and the selling price is slightly more expensive. The matter was then submitted to a joint meeting of the factories, and it was unanimously approved and forwarded to your association for the record. Therefore, we are submitting this information together, and we ask your association to handle it accordingly.

### Zhang Jinglu Regrets Her Actions and Attempts Suicide, Suffering a Serious Chest Wound from a Shot, Sent to Fumin Hospital in Critical Condition

Since a certain party advocated peace, because all parties were unmoved, they organized the so-called "Material Engineering Department" and forced all parties to participate. However, since the publication of the Wang-Japan secret agreement, a major shock occurred within the organization. Those with a conscience have fled. According to reliable sources, Zhang Jinglu (female), the director of the puppet "Special Engineering Headquarters," originally worked in Hankou. After the national army withdrew last year, Zhang came to Shanghai to take up her post. She was unexpectedly forced to join. Recently, she deeply realized that she had been deceived and felt very regretful. Therefore, on the 16th of this month, she shot herself in the chest, suffering a serious wound. It is reported that she was sent to Fumin Hospital in Hongkou for treatment by a certain party and is in critical condition. However, according to another source, Zhang's suicide was due to a romantic dispute.

### Shanghai Merchants Procure Goods to Wenzhou, Approval for Import of North-South Goods

Shanghai and Wenzhou merchants believe that navigation to Wenzhou has gradually recovered, but the authorities have very strict restrictions on imported freight. Recently, they separately petitioned the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Yongjia County Chamber of Commerce to allow merchants to purchase and import north-south goods. According to the shipping industry, the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Yongjia Chamber of Commerce have now separately approved, stating that as long as the north-south goods are not foreign goods, they will be allowed to be imported in moderation. After receiving the order, the merchants have resumed purchases separately, and it is learned that some of the ships operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line are now planning to stop at Xinghua, Fujian, on the way from Shanghai to Wenzhou to load local products from Fujian Province, such as dried longan, lychees, red and black dates, and other south goods, and transport them to Wenzhou.

### Chen Keguang Shot Dead in Front of Jue Lin Temple, Father Claims He Was Ambushed While Seeing Off Guests, Three Shots All in Vital Areas

Chen Keguang, 35 years old, from Hangzhou, lived at No. 5, Jiande Village, Yuyuan Road. He was currently a recruitment committee member of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Ballroom Group. Yesterday was his father, Bao Kun's, 70th birthday, and Chen specially hosted a celebration banquet at Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant (i.e., the intersection of Wanluo Road) at No. 254 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. Many relatives and friends went to offer their congratulations. At around 7:40 p.m., some of the relatives and friends finished the banquet and dispersed. Chen was politely seeing them off. However, as soon as Chen left the gate of Jue Lin Temple, three to five thugs lying in ambush at the intersection of Gello Road fired six shots at Chen. Chen fell to the ground in response, bleeding profusely. At that time, the Songshan Road Police Station was nearby and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to surround and arrest the suspects. As a result, one suspect was captured. After examining Chen's body, a total of three shots were found, two in the chest and one in the head. He was already dead. The body was then taken to the Taitas Trolley Morgue to await examination. The police are investigating the reasons for Chen's shooting.

### Suppressing Prices Requires Implementation of Fair Price Laws, If Not Followed, Forced Public Sales at Fixed Prices, Shanghai Goods Shipped to Northern Jiangsu Subject to Taxation Based on Value

The soaring prices of goods during wartime have complex reasons, but the abnormal prices in Shanghai are due to the influx of hot money and the hoarding and manipulation by speculators, which is the main reason. All parties earnestly hope that the concession authorities can refer to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' fair price laws, thoroughly investigate the goods stored in warehouses, and order them to be sold at fair prices to benefit the people and maintain the market. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' explanation of the fair price laws, before the establishment of a fair price mechanism, inducing hoarding to be released onto the market and cracking down on hoarding for speculation is an emergency measure. The relevant authorities should investigate the quantity of daily necessities in stock and sales, and, based on information from various sources, set fair prices and encourage merchants to sell at those prices.

Hoarding is a Great Disloyalty to the People

After persuasion and failure to sell, a warning will be issued. If the warning is still not followed, the authorities will forcibly purchase the goods at fair prices. In short, the authorities should fully consider the legitimate profits of ordinary merchants and not let them suffer losses. However, if hoarding prevents goods from circulating and affects the people's livelihood, the authorities cannot sit idly by and will definitely find ways to suppress it, set prices for public sale, and provide remedies.

Notice from the Wartime Special Tax Bureau

After the war, the prices of goods in Shanghai have skyrocketed, resulting in a lack of standards for commodity prices. The selling prices of the same item often vary due to competition among factories and businesses, creating a state of anarchy. The various industry associations in Shanghai received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Wartime Special Business Tax Collection Bureau yesterday, along with a form, stating that all goods shipped from Shanghai to counties in northern Jiangsu will be subject to a special business tax. However, the collection of this special business tax must be based on the value of the goods. In order to protect the interests of all factories and businesses, it is necessary to conduct an accurate investigation of the pricing of goods. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished without the assistance of all industries in the investigation. The various industry associations, considering that this matter concerns their own interests, have notified all their members to fill out the form and submit it to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for reporting to the bureau.

### French Municipal Council Stipulates Methods for Taxing Real Estate

As for the house tax, it shall be handled in accordance with the regulations on collecting house tax promulgated in the revised version of last year. The house tax rate is set at 15% of the total rental value. The method of estimating the rental value is as follows: Section 1: The rental value east of the Bund to Avenue Lieutenant Petin and Avenue Dubail is estimated as follows: For houses and vacant land, it should be calculated at 5% of the total estimated value of the real estate in the area. Section 2: The rental value west of Avenue Lieutenant Petin and Avenue Dubail, and east of Route Lugol and Route Boileau, is estimated as follows: Real estate should be calculated at 6% of the total estimated value of the property. Land of three mu or less should be calculated at 6% of the total estimated value of the land. The portion from three mu to six mu should be calculated at 4% of the total estimated value of the land. The portion from six mu to nine mu should be calculated at 2% of the total estimated value of the land. The portion above nine mu should be calculated at 1% of the total estimated value of the land. Section 3: The rental value west of Route Lugol and Route Boileau, and east of Avenue du Roi Albert, is calculated as follows: Real estate should be calculated at 7% of the total estimated value of the property. Land of three mu or less should be calculated at 7% of the total estimated value of the land. The portion from three mu to six mu should be calculated at 4% of the total estimated value of the land. The portion from six mu to nine mu should be calculated at 2% of the total estimated value of the land. The portion above nine mu should be calculated at 1% of the total estimated value of the land. Section 4: The rental value west of Avenue du Roi Albert, within the expanded concession of 1914, is estimated as follows: Real estate should be calculated at 8% of the total estimated value of the property. Land of three mu or less should be calculated at 8% of the total estimated value of the land. The portion from three mu to six mu should be calculated at 4% of the total estimated value of the land. The portion from six mu to nine mu should be calculated at 2% of the total estimated value of the land. The portion above nine mu should be calculated at 1% of the total estimated value of the land. All plots used for commercial or industrial purposes cannot apply the above-mentioned method of progressively reducing the rental value. However, all should be estimated according to the most recent rate of three mu.

### Tang Leang-li Attempts to Exclude Foreign News Agencies, Similar to Japanese Actions in the Puppet State; Foreign News Agencies Refuse En Masse

According to today's edition of the *China Weekly Review*, Tang Leang-li claimed that after the establishment of the "new government" in Nanjing, the Wang Jingwei faction would implement censorship of all Chinese and Western newspapers and news agencies in the Japanese-occupied areas, and would establish a puppet "Central News Agency" to broadcast news. All foreign news agencies such as Reuters, Havas, Domei, and United Press (except for the Trans-Ocean News Service) would be excluded and replaced by this agency. The headquarters would be in Nanjing, with branches in various locations. The puppet agency would pay foreign news agencies a considerable price to buy all their domestic and foreign news, which would then be distributed to various locations by the Nanjing headquarters. Tang claimed that all news agencies in Shanghai, whether located in the concession areas or not, would have to accept this proposal uniformly. According to various foreign news agencies in Shanghai, they have unanimously rejected this proposal from the Japanese puppet side. However, according to sources in Nanjing, the plan is already in progress and must be achieved. The steps taken are the same as those implemented by the Japanese in "Manchukuo."

### Zhejiang East Draft Development

Since Xiaoshan in Zhejiang East was lost as a war zone, shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been obstructed, and postal services have been difficult. The Shanghai Postal Administration will temporarily suspend the acceptance and development of postal package remittances in Shaoxing, Zhuji, Fengqiao, Paitou, Linpu, Xiaoshan, and other places in Zhejiang East, for two months. However, Zhejiang natives in Shanghai have repeatedly requested the Shanghai Postal Administration to resume the development of drafts. The Shanghai Postal Administration believes that this request is factual and has telegraphed the Zhejiang Postal Administration (Lishui) to resume at a fixed time. Now, the Shanghai Postal Administration will issue a notice of resumption as soon as it receives a reply telegram. It is reported that remittances from the above-mentioned places to Shanghai are still processed in the usual way through Bo's drafts. As for ordinary letters, express letters, registered letters, postcards, and printed matter sent from Shanghai to various places in Zhejiang East, they are sealed and sent once a day, waiting for loading on ships.

### Food Regulation Committee Withdraws Rice Orders, Raises One Million Yuan; Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Gradually Arrive in Shanghai; Hoarders' Actions Are Insufficient to Cause Concern

The Shanghai Citizens' Food Regulation Association, which has been established for less than three months, has already purchased more than 50,000 bags of foreign rice. A total of three batches of foreign rice purchased by the association, totaling 18,000 bags, have been released. All of these were paid for by the entrusted purchasers who obtained the goods from the trust department of Jin City Bank. Recently, foreign firms have continued to deliver ten batches of foreign rice, totaling more than 22,000 bags. However, each subscriber must pay and pick up the goods properly before they can be released, so it cannot be done without the association first raising a large amount of cash. It is said that the amount of money involved is as much as one million yuan. The authorities of the association specially convened the fifth meeting of the Standing Committee on the day before yesterday for this matter. Those present included Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiyin, Wu Yunzhai, Pei Yunqing, etc., and those attending as observers were Gui Yanfang, Xu Baohua, Li Wenjie, Zhu Peien, etc. It was resolved at that meeting to raise 180,000 yuan by the 21st to withdraw three batches of goods, totaling 4,500 bags. After the bank opens on the 26th, Yu Qiaqing and others will raise the huge sum of money separately to prepare for the successive release of goods.

More than 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai

The Taikoo Company's Jiangsu ship arrived in port yesterday afternoon, transporting 1,063 bags from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the company's dock in the French Concession. The Saagen, managed by the Java Mail Ship Company, loaded more than 35,000 bags of foreign rice from Rangoon and was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, but it is now known that it will arrive on the 27th.

Rice Hoarders Are Acting Up Again

Yesterday, another batch of 5,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai by foreign ships, and more than 800 bags of local rice were also transported from the inner harbor. However, after the rice market opened yesterday, the price of rice rose abnormally again due to the actions of hoarders. However, this is a temporary phenomenon. After the price of rice has fallen for several days, the general hoarders are thinking about reversing the downward trend. However, with the rice warehouses full and the supply abundant, these people will eventually run out of tricks, and the price of rice will return to a decline. Also, the rice market announced that today and tomorrow (the 23rd and 24th) are the Tomb Sweeping Festival and will be closed for two days, and will resume business on the 25th.

Subsidized Rice Sales Continue During the Tomb Sweeping Festival Holiday

In addition, the third phase of subsidized rice sales entrusted by the Subsidized Rice Committee to rice merchants began on the 19th of this month, and buyers have been enthusiastic for several days. Although today and tomorrow are the Tomb Sweeping Festival, the subsidized rice is stored in Chinese warehouses and can still be delivered as usual, so subsidized sales will continue.

### Overseas Mail: Via Suez or Pacific; Those Who Wish to Go via Siberia May

The *North-China Daily News* reports that the Shanghai Post Office has accepted the request of the British authorities in Shanghai to send British people's mail to Europe, except for those who specify that they want to take the Siberian route, via other routes to Europe. All post offices in Shanghai have received the above notice. According to a postal official, unless the mail is marked "Via Siberia," it will be transported to Europe via the Suez Canal or the Pacific Ocean.

### Ningbo Authorities Stipulate That Five Small Steamers Will Shuttle Passengers in Order

Shipping industry news: The Ningbo Steamship Industry Association and the Ship Inspection Team discussed safety measures for passenger shuttles on the 18th and 19th. It was decided to try charging a shuttle boat fee with the purchase of the ship ticket, and stipulate that five small steamers, namely Xin Da Li, Xin Ning Yu, Tian Ma, Tian Bao, and Zhen Hai, will shuttle passengers in order, to ensure safety.

### Shanghai Customs Surplus Exports Increase; Black Market Foreign Exchange Declines; Maintained by the Exchange Equalization Fund; Improving Exchange Rate Is Only a Matter of Time

After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee made every effort to stabilize foreign exchange, the Chinese legal foreign exchange has remained consistent. As for the Shanghai black market foreign exchange, due to the manipulation of speculators, there have been extremely large fluctuations. Now, market rumors have gradually disappeared, and the trend is relatively stable, which is actually due to the assistance of the Equalization Fund. The committee's maintenance of Shanghai's black market foreign exchange has become an open secret. As for the amount of the fund's supply, estimates vary. However, the foreign exchange black market has a deep relationship with foreign trade. Now Shanghai trade has become a surplus. Taking January as an example, imports and exports have actually reached a balance. Their value is converted into foreign currency according to the open market price, and an export surplus of about 20,000 pounds can be obtained. This is completely different from the situation in the autumn of last year, when monthly import surpluses of 3 million pounds were common. After the export industry has developed, the profound and significant impact on the exchange market has not yet reached the expectations of some people. However, if the export situation can be maintained for a long time, the exchange market will eventually change accordingly. This is only a matter of time.

### Drivers of Yunfei and Other Car Companies Request Increased Tip Money, Presenting Four Conditions for Acceptance; Labor and Management Held Negotiations Yesterday

The drivers of the four major taxi companies in Shanghai, Xiang Sheng, Yunfei, Yinse, and Tailai, have made a formal request to the authorities of these companies for an increase of 20% in tips. Representatives of the drivers of these companies also held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to conduct negotiations. According to what the *Ping Ming She* reporter learned from both labor and management, the details are as follows:

Four Requests

The drivers of the four companies believe that the cost of living is increasing day by day, and their limited salaries are not enough to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, on the 16th of this month, they made a request to the companies for an increase in tips: (1) An increase of 20% in tips is the minimum. The method is based on the foreign code as the unit, two dimes per foreign (that is, four dimes should be charged for each trip, and so on for overtime. If there is a subsequent increase, the fare should be the standard). (2) Tips should be collected at the same time as the fare. This is the method for customers who pay in cash. In the case of signature customers, it must be settled according to the face value of the ticket and paid by the company. (3) If tips are collected in the fare, it must be stated in the newspaper, but tips cannot be the target, which can easily cause misunderstandings among people in society. It is more appropriate for the company to increase the fare. (4) Please reply to the above request on the 19th. However, the company authorities did not reply at that time, so the two parties agreed to hold a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday to seek a solution.

Company's View

However, according to the company's opinion, it is believed that: (1) The driver's request is somewhat beyond the scope. The direct relationship of this request is with the customers, not the company authorities. It is even more unreasonable to ask the company to publish a statement in the newspaper to increase tips. (2) The company authorities do not have the right to collect tips at the same time as the fare. In fact, customers have no reason to pay tips. (3) The regulation of tips will make it difficult to distinguish the merits of the driver's performance. (4) There is no precedent for the regulation of tips in various industries. As for the waiters in wine shops and pubs, they have a 10% commission because they have no formal salary income. (5) An increase of 20% in tips is somewhat extravagant. According to the custom, the tips paid by passengers are around two dimes. If an extra request is made to the customer, there is no sufficient or reasonable reason. Moreover, the income of drivers is already more generous than that of other industries.

Both Sides Negotiate

As for the negotiations between the two sides, the results were not obtained until late last night. However, both sides can understand each other with a sincere attitude and strive to solve this problem, on the one hand to maintain the lives of drivers, and at the same time to take into account the interests of the company, and work together to overcome difficulties. Therefore, it is not difficult to obtain a satisfactory solution to this decision.

### Yangtze River Shipping Increases Rental Fees; Shipping Fees for Thousand-Ton Ships: 100,000

Since the British government launched the war against Germany, many British ships in the Far East have been requisitioned to Hong Kong and Nanyang for combat purposes. British firms such as Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson & Co., and Shanghai Tug & Lighter Co. have all dispatched small-tonnage barges one after another. The ships of Butterfield & Swire are all rented to shipping companies to operate. It is reported that since the outbreak of the European War, due to the requisition orders, the number of ships remaining in various places on the Huangpu River has gradually decreased. Therefore, in recent months, it has been quite difficult for shipping companies to rent ships, and the rental prices are extremely expensive. Shipping fees for shipping vessels of around a thousand tons require at least 100,000, which is more than double that before the war. In addition, the price of coal has soared, and the business of the shipping companies is particularly affected.

### The Broadcasting Station Established by the *North-China Daily News* Will Begin Broadcasting Within Two or Three Weeks

The special broadcasting radio station built by the *North-China Daily News* in Shanghai has been largely completed. The *Ping Ming She* reporter recently learned that the station has a power of 1 kilowatt and was designed and built by Mr. Louis, a well-known radio engineer in Shanghai. It is expected to begin broadcasting within two or three weeks. Shortwave broadcasting equipment will also be installed soon. It is generally believed that this is an important step for the United Kingdom to strengthen its propaganda organization in the Far East, and recalls that on the 20th of this month, the British Minister of Information, Mr. Lee, replied in the House of Commons to a question from a Conservative Party member, Mr. Knox, saying that British news agencies in Hong Kong and Shanghai broadcast news in Chinese every day and correct incorrect rumors. Therefore, it is believed that the British news broadcasting station established here will not only provide rapid reports on European current events, but will also enhance friendship and understanding between China and the United Kingdom. According to reports, the *North-China Daily News* currently broadcasts news twice a day in Chinese and English using the Shanghai-language XMHD broadcasting station, at 12:45 PM and 9:00 PM.

### Japanese Military Vehicle Falls Into a Hole on the Qingpu-Shanghai Road

At around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, a Japanese military truck loaded with military supplies and medicines, etc., with two Japanese soldiers sitting on the truck, was driving from Shanghai to Qingpu. When it reached the vicinity of the Xujing Cemetery on the Qingpu-Shanghai Road, it mistakenly fell into a hole in the ground, and the entire vehicle was trapped and could not move. Later, the soldiers of the Fusheng Fuyu ambush team of the Third War Zone in Qingpu arrived and escorted a truck and two Japanese soldiers to the headquarters for disposition.

### The "White Rice Donation Campaign" Held Its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

Students of Soochow University in Shanghai, in view of the high cost of living and the increasing number of poor people, launched the "White Rice Donation Campaign" and organized a preparatory committee. They held an inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at Murr Hall, chaired by Zhang Shuliang, to discuss how to widely launch the donation work. It was decided that the donation amounts would be divided into six types: one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, and five hundred yuan. The main body of the campaign would be the teachers and students of the entire school, and they would actively promote the donation to the society. In order to expand the effect, in addition to dispatching representatives to jointly promote the campaign with Christian universities in the city and sending packages to various trade associations to appeal for sponsorship, they have also negotiated with major theaters to agree to show promotional slides every day from yesterday to April 19 to urge people to donate more. The collection points will be set up in the accounting office of the Law School of Murr Hall Soochow University. The donations from this movement will be used as the expenses for the subsidized sale of white rice in Murr Hall and other places.

### Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association Holds a Hygiene Movement

The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, in view of the large number of rickshaw pullers suffering from diseases recently, decided to hold a rickshaw pullers hygiene movement on April 25, 26, and 27. The program includes visiting anti-epidemic injections and hygiene performances every morning (organized by students from the Rickshaw Pullers Children's School), watching hygiene movies in the afternoon, and vaccinating against smallpox and holding baby competitions. The location is on Macgregor Road (near MacHarg Road) in the Public Concession.

### Population Concentrates in Shanghai, the Construction Industry is Active, According to the Municipal Council's Annual Report

After the Sino-Japanese War, the population who came to Shanghai to seek refuge from various places concentrated in the city. As a result, all the houses in the concession were almost unable to accommodate this continuously incoming population. Landlords, in view of this, built houses one after another to meet the needs. Therefore, the activity of the construction industry in the concession last year broke all previous records. According to the Municipal Council's 1939 annual report, there were 4,554 requests for construction in the concession, and 2,470 were approved. The price of all approved buildings was 1,183,790 yuan. In addition, 6,615 permits for minor works were issued, with construction costs totaling 1,646,360 yuan.

### Fire on Guangxi Road, Six Injured

At 9:30 last night, a residence surnamed in No. 19, Cide Lane, Guangxi Road, suddenly lost caution, and thick smoke spread everywhere. The fire was extremely fierce. The fire brigade rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and made every effort to rescue. The fire was extinguished after two hours. A total of six buildings were burned down. When the fire was raging, four tenants living upstairs in the house, Zhou Xingxiu (31 years old), Yu Dingsheng (43 years old), Yu Zhou (73 years old), and Tong Yao (30 years old), were unable to escape due to the staircase being burned down. They jumped down from the window, and all four were seriously injured. Zhou Xingru (15 years old) and Yao Juwen (29 years old) escaped from the fire pit, and both were severely burned. All were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment in ambulances by the fire brigade.

### The Puppet "Central Market" Opens; Japanese Puppets Control Vegetables, Compel Merchants to Participate and Be Subject to Their Control; Concession Residents Will Bear a Heavier Burden Again

The sentry box in front of the gate of the puppet "Shanghai Central Vegetable Market" guarded by British troops was moved yesterday to the south side of the "market" gate. Scottish soldiers are still stationed in the kiosk. The "market" is newly decorated, and a few barehanded marines swagger among them. The opening is set for 10 am this morning, and business will begin on the 25th. It is rumored that vegetable merchants in Caojiadu have been forced to participate. Here are the details:

Sentry Box Moved South

The British garrison authorities in Shanghai and the Municipal Council, in response to the request of the Japanese Navy Landing Forces, opened a gap in the "Si" district of North Xizang Road at 9:30 AM on the 21st of this month, allowing people and goods to enter and exit without permits after the opening of the puppet "Central Market." A new sentry box was set up in the center in front of the "market" gate, manned by a Scottish soldier, and Western and Chinese detectives from the Huizi Police Department patrolled the vicinity. When the *Daguang She* reporter visited again yesterday, he saw that the sentry box facing south and sitting north in front of the "market" gate on the 20th had been moved to the south side of the gate, facing north and sitting south, and soldiers and detectives from the police station were still performing their patrol duties as usual. From the looks of it, the traffic line at the "market" gate has been widened to facilitate the entry and exit of people, vehicles, and goods.

Market Opening

The puppet "Central Market" was completely opened yesterday. In addition to the two or three Indian guards who are often waiting and seem to be checking the entry permits, there are also a few armed marines and plainclothesmen swaggering among them. A tent is set up on the north side inside the gate, which is the place where the Japanese army is stationed. The houses, the observation pavilion in the courtyard, and the short walls outside the gate in the "market" are all surrounded by red and white foreign cloths in the style of the Japanese army. The Japanese puppet flags and the flags of all nations are hung on the top of the lookout, and a new colored archway is built at the gate, with the three yellow characters "Celebration Venue" attached to it. It is said that the puppet "market" has been officially scheduled to open at 10:00 AM today. The puppet "mayor" and "social bureau representatives" will all go there to preside over the opening ceremony, and the Japanese puppet will often send people to supervise and control vegetables and harsh chores. The official business date has started on the 25th.

Compelled to Participate

The *Daguang She* reporter also learned from relevant parties that the "Central Market," jointly funded by the Japanese puppet, has been planned for more than ten months, trying to monopolize the benefits of vegetable sales, but has been repeatedly opposed by vegetable merchants, who refuse to compromise. Therefore, this has been delayed until now. Now the Japanese puppets are determined to do it, regardless of everything, and decided to force Caojiadu merchants to participate first. For vegetable merchants in the 16th Pier, Laozha Bridge, and Xinzha Bridge, they will also deal with them with the same means, otherwise, they will threaten to cut off their vegetable supply. It is expected that vegetable prices will inevitably soar in the near future, and the Chinese and foreign residents of the two concessions will bear a heavier burden again.

### Man and Woman Sue Each Other Over Marriage; The Wedding Date Has Arrived, But the Man Does Not Show Up; The Two Cases Sued by Both Parties Are Combined for Trial

Li Shoujun, a native of Shanghai Tangwan Township, 30 years old this year, formerly living at No. 8, Huangjiaku Lane, Carter Road, and now living at No. 2, Xingshun North Lane, Leimilu, French Concession, through the introduction of Wu Jiange and Shen Jinsheng, made an engagement with Qian Kaoyi (28 years old this year), a woman from Minhang, currently living at No. 28, Dalu Lane, Route Lugol, on June 15 last year. They chose January 19 of this year to hold the wedding at the Tang Shoumo Hotel. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly

Changed His Mind on the Eve of the Wedding

Resulting in the wedding not being held as scheduled, the dispute between the two parties arose. First, the man filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court against the woman to dissolve the engagement and claim damages, the details of which have been published in this newspaper. The woman, Qian Kaoyi, also filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against the man, Li Shoujun, to dissolve the engagement and claim damages. According to the complaint, the defendant deliberately violated the wedding date and requested that the engagement be dissolved and compensation for damages be ordered. The plaintiff, on June 15, 28th year [of the Republic of China], through the introduction of Wu Jiange, made an engagement with the defendant at Honglai Restaurant. On November 5 of the same year, the defendant notified the introducer, Wu Jiange, that January 19, 29th year [of the Republic of China]

Will Hold the Wedding

And the defendant designated Tang Shoumo Hotel on Jiangxi Road as the wedding hall, and the plaintiff prepared all the dowry and other matters. As a result, the plaintiff and relatives went there on the day, but the defendant did not show up. It is as if treating marriage as a child's play, which is intentionally insulting the plaintiff's personality. The plaintiff's material losses are great, and the spiritual losses are unspeakable. In addition to grief and indignation, the plaintiff immediately entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to the defendant on January 20 of the following day to inquire, but the defendant ignored it, which clearly showed that after violating the wedding date, he had no intention of fulfilling the engagement again. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 976, Paragraph 1, Section 2 of the Civil Code, the plaintiff

Is Entitled to Apply for Termination

And in accordance with the provisions of Articles 977 and 979 of the same law, the defendant shall be liable for damages caused by violating the wedding date, and requested the court to try the case and order the defendant to dissolve the engagement and compensate the plaintiff for material losses of 1,145 yuan, 8 jiao, and 4 fen, and spiritual losses of 6,000 yuan, and order him to bear the litigation costs. The First Special Court, according to the complaint, opened a court session to summon [the defendant]. Because the defendant Li Shoujun had moved to the French Concession, it was ruled that the case be transferred to the Second Special Court for trial. The case file from the First Special Court was received by the Second Special Court, and Wen Zheng

Opened a Court Session to Summons [the Parties] Yesterday Afternoon

The plaintiff, Qian Kaoyi, and her agent, lawyer Li Mo, were brought to court to state the previous situation. The defendant, Li Shoujun, was absent and entrusted lawyer Ni Wang to state on his behalf that Li Shoujun's lawsuit against Qian Kaoyi had been tried once by judge Li Liang. At that time, the other party had stated that they had filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court and were waiting for the transfer to your court for judgment. They were instructed to reschedule the case. Now they request that the two cases be combined for trial. The plaintiff's lawyer also made the same statement. The court verified the situation and ordered that the case be rescheduled to wait for the case to be combined for trial.

### The Chinese Union Amusement Club Celebrates its Second Anniversary and Congratulates Wen Lanting on His Seventy-First Birthday

The Chinese Union Amusement Club of this city, with the aim of promoting healthy entertainment and improving leisure life, has been established for more than a year. Currently, the club has 6,000 members and its affairs are quite developed. The tenth day of this month marks the second anniversary of the club's establishment. A celebration and memorial meeting was held in the club's auditorium, as well as to celebrate Mr. Wen Lanting's seventy-first birthday. Honorary directors Fei Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Chen Yisheng, Li Wenjie, and other gentlemen, as well as more than 300 members of the permanent membership recruitment team were present. There were wonderful performances in the afternoon, and a dinner party in the evening, with the event dispersing at midnight. The atmosphere was extremely lively.

### The Pseudo-Market in West Shanghai is Likely to be Shelved

The so-called "West Shanghai Vegetable Market" at the corner of Brennan Road and Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai was originally scheduled to officially open on the 25th of this month. It was previously reported that the "chairman" was Zhang Longhai and Zhang Zhao Kui of Tongxing Company. After investigation, it has been learned that the chairman of the "market" is actually He Baokang of Gonghe Company. However, due to the Japanese side's order that the organizers must recruit a certain number of "members" and prepay a deposit of 50,000 yuan, so far, almost no local merchants have voluntarily joined the "market." The organizers, seeing this difficult situation and lacking the ability to raise the 50,000 yuan deposit, most members have adopted a passive attitude, while He Baokang is still working hard to rally support. However, his personal strength is limited, so the opening on the 25th is fundamentally difficult to achieve and may be shelved.

### Kidnapping Case in West Shanghai: The Kidnapped Person is the Accountant of a Stone Powder Factory; All Five Thugs Carried Guns for Intimidation

Shunchang Stone Powder Factory at No. 14, Lane 1034, Gordon Road, Public Concession, hired a truck from Sanyou Automobile Transportation Company (license plate number 23823) to transport a large quantity of materials to Father Labour Road in the French Concession at around 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. The factory sent its accountant, Xu Jicheng, to escort the truck. Unexpectedly, when the truck drove to Kaixuan Road in West Shanghai, five thugs suddenly appeared, one of whom was carrying a handgun. Seeing the truck approaching, four of them drew their guns to intimidate, ordering the truck to stop. The driver, seeing that they were armed, dared not disobey, so he stopped by the roadside. Two thugs immediately boarded the truck, dragged Xu Jicheng down, handcuffed his hands, and dragged him onto a rickshaw that was waiting there, speeding away into a small alley. At that time, there were still people watching the truck, and they also fled after the others had gone far away. At the time, the thugs were waiting by the roadside, looking like people from an agency, standing guard and searching, so passersby did not suspect anything. It is said that Xu Jicheng's kidnapping may be for ransom, or it may involve other relationships, which has not yet been determined. Afterwards, Wang Fusheng from the factory reported the case to the responsible police station, requesting investigation and arrest. The police are now dispatching officers to strictly apprehend the perpetrators.

### Eleventh Joint Marriage Ceremony of the Lake Society to be Held on April 21st

The Lake Society in this city has been organizing joint marriages for fellow villagers for ten sessions, and participation has been very enthusiastic. It is now known that the eleventh joint marriage ceremony for fellow villagers will be held on April 21st. The participation fee is still reduced to 12 yuan per couple, in order to promote frugality. In recent days, applications for participation have been endless. It is said that there is a limited quota, and once the quota is full, registration will be closed immediately. Those who wish to participate can quickly contact the staff at the society's office on Guizhou Road.

### Miscellaneous Social News

The Changyu Company gambling den at the intersection of Jiucang Street and Dongqingyun Street in Nanshi, like other gambling dens, met the same fate and was closed down a few days ago. However, the den owner suddenly had a whimsical idea and changed the guise to a Tanhuang (local opera) venue, still luring people to gamble. At 1:30 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 21st), it was discovered by Japanese military police, who dispatched many soldiers to go there, removing all the decorative arches and two white porcelain door lamps installed at the entrance, and driving out the gamblers. Before leaving, they also nailed the back door with wooden boards.

Yesterday, there were two fires in the French Concession. One was at 11:20 a.m. in the servant's room at No. 35, Lane 163, Zanchong Road, which was quickly extinguished. The other was at the home of Zhang Liming at No. 365, Kangti Road, where a fire broke out in the attic at 2:30 p.m., resulting in the destruction of the attic, with no other losses.

At 6:30 a.m. yesterday, the gas pipe suddenly leaked at the Dazhong Silk Weaving Factory at No. 51, Binlang Road in West Shanghai. At that time, ten workers, including Zhu Wenlong, Li Bingnan, Chen Zhengwu, Wu Cailin, Yang Baochun, Zhao Dagen, Zhu Lifu, Wu Acai, Zhang Bingnian, and Pan Chengzhu, were poisoned. Afterwards, they were sent to the hospital for treatment.

Around 10 a.m. the other day, a pedestrian was passing by the Hong Bank riverside behind the Xinchang Workshop in Caojiadu, West Shanghai, when a gunshot suddenly rang out. It was not known where the shot came from, but it hit the pedestrian in the waist, causing him to fall to the ground in extreme pain, moaning non-stop. He was then sent to a hospital in West Shanghai for treatment. It is now known that the pedestrian's name is Ma Pengfei, from Chongming, 39 years old.

Zhang Zaiyuan, 27 years old, is from Yi County. His wife, Zhang Lin, is about the same age as Zhang. Recently, because Zhang lost his job, Lin suddenly announced her departure. In recent days, Zhang has been searching everywhere without success, and suffering from the pressure of life, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. Yesterday morning, he bought two yuan worth of opium at a certain "swallow's nest" in Xinkang Lane, Gsavier Road, and swallowed it. After a while, the poison took effect and he died.

### Attention Lost Boy

Dear Editor, This morning at ten o'clock, I was walking past the entrance of the Continental Hotel on Yuqiaxiang Road when I saw a boy about six or seven years old, holding a beautiful cigarette paper box, walking from north to south, crying for his mother. He was lost near the Nanjing Grand Theater and did not know the direction. I asked him where he lived, but he said he was from the countryside and could not answer in detail, so I handed him over to the patrolman on that road, who took him to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Please publish this letter in your newspaper so that the child's parents can be informed and come to take him home. This is a great act of public virtue. Sincerely, Wang Jing, March 23rd.

### The Advent of Incidents is Always Preceded by Alarms - Coughing (is) the Alarm (for) Lung Disease

The organization of the human body is extremely marvelous. If there are pathological changes, they can always be naturally manifested externally, such as pain, itching, soreness, or numbness, just like alarms, so that prevention and treatment can be carried out as early as possible. The marvel of the Creator is truly extreme.

The lungs are unusually delicate. They breathe day and night, every second without stopping, and the contact with the atmosphere is most frequent. In this spring season, the weather is abnormal, with sudden cold and warm spells, making it most prone to illness. The lungs are the first to bear the brunt. The advent of lung disease is always preceded by the "cough" alarm, whether it is a dry cough, a severe cough, excessive phlegm, or thick phlegm. If it is not treated in time, the lungs will be severely damaged. Do not take it lightly, otherwise it often leads to the suffering of pulmonary tuberculosis. Among the people of the country, those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis are at the top of the world. This is all caused by the usual disregard for colds and coughs, leading to lung weakness and atrophy.

Liangyuan White Sand Loquat Paste is a national product and a sacred product for nourishing the lungs and strengthening the body. It stops coughs and resolves phlegm, and its efficacy is unparalleled. It kills bacteria and prevents tuberculosis, and its effect is especially fast. As for new coughs from colds, take a cup before going to bed, and the next morning it will be as if nothing had happened. The reputation is well-known, no need to repeat.

This paste is produced by Shanghai Liangyuan Pharmaceutical Factory under strict supervision and is sold in various companies, southern goods, tea and food stores, and medicine shops. When purchasing, please firmly specify the "Liangyuan" brand name, so as not to mistakenly purchase counterfeit goods and delay the opportunity for treatment. (Anbang)

### Grains: The Source of Japonica Rice is Slightly Smoother; 3,000 Bags Transferred from Hongkou; News that Wuhu and Other Places Will be Lifted

After the rice market's freedom and fatigue, yesterday, whether it was domestic rice or foreign rice, both continued to rise again. Moreover, with the upcoming Spring Festival and the market closing for two days, local shops were all thinking of purchasing reserves, so sales suddenly boomed. In addition, the previous repeated sharp declines in rice prices have allowed domestic dealers to agree, and they are also handling transactions smoothly. Moreover, ordinary floating speculators, seeing the market pick up, mutually reversed from selling to buying, while the original long-term merchants all held their goods, waiting for opportunities. The market's chips suddenly felt insufficient, and for a time, the sound of asking prices filled the market. Each store then raised prices by half a yuan in the morning. For example, No. 1 Saigon opened at 40 yuan, the fire-milled at 38.5 yuan, No. 2 Saigon at 37 yuan, and the small-milled at 36.5 yuan. Afterwards, the competition for purchases became more and more vigorous, and the market's goods became more and more scarce, and the market price rose immediately. Until the close of the market, there was no slight setback, and the situation felt even tighter than before. It is estimated that the closing price of No. 1 Saigon again broke through the 40 yuan mark, reaching 40.08 yuan and 40.05 yuan, No. 2 special old 38 yuan, market 37.5 yuan, special fire-milled 30 yuan, small-milled 37.3 yuan, Siam special 29 yuan, No. 2 37.5 yuan, Tokyo special-sharp 37.3 yuan to 36.5 yuan, mixed broken 33.5 yuan to 31 yuan, which was more than 1 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous market.

The situation of glutinous rice and thick and thin japonica early and late rice and other domestic rice was similar, all increasing by about one yuan. However, japonica rice still has more secret transactions. Only Nangang Hu early at 40 yuan was opened on the market. As for the rest, such as Xikun japonica, it was said that the secret price outside the market was 46 yuan for special, and 45 yuan for market, Li Sheng 42 yuan or so, Qingsi special thin 43.8 yuan and 43 yuan, early and late rice original bags 43 yuan. As for domestic sources, they have been slightly smoother recently. Yesterday, more than 3,000 bags of japonica and glutinous rice were transferred from the Hongkou district, and it is widely rumored that various goods from Wuhu, Jiangbei, and other places will also be lifted and transported to Shanghai again.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese Monopoly on Central China Silk

With the Qingming Festival approaching and the Grain Rain harvest of silkworms, the "China Central Silk Company" established by the Japanese has already launched a vigorous offensive in the major silkworm areas of the Taihu Lake basin. From Suzhou and Wuxi to Hangzhou and Jiaxing, anyone who contacts them to open a cocoon factory can borrow at least 6,000 yuan in legal tender, or even more than double that amount. As a result, unscrupulous merchants and local ruffians flock to them in droves. Before the silkworms are harvested and the seeds are planted, the cocoon market is already being arranged, and the number of households is exceeding previous years. Farmers in Hangzhou and Jiaxing often lack money at the end of the lunar year and pre-sell mulberry leaves for the coming spring, called dry leaves. The usual price is cheaper, but last year the Japanese also came out to buy them, in order to manipulate the leaf market and win over the people. As long as the Baojia chief certifies, each dan can be sold for 5 yuan in legal tender. This year, the price of fresh cocoons is pre-set at 160 yuan per 100 market catties, but the price of local silk is still over 200 yuan per 100 taels. Therefore, although China Central Silk is enticing with profits, and with guerrillas scattered throughout the areas, whether they will tolerate the large amount of silk being bundled up and taken away to absorb foreign exchange will depend on future evidence.

### Tea Prices Plummet

The transaction of foreign green tea in this city, recently because the listing of Hong Kong black and green tea is booming, the inventory of crude tea in the Shanghai market is abundant, and the experts are not worried about the lack, taking the opportunity to suppress the price. The other day, a total of more than 160 boxes of Zhenmei pearl tea were purchased by Baochang, Xiehe, and other companies. The selling price of drawn Zhen was 306 yuan, the unified Zhen was 195 yuan to 220 yuan, and the selling price of pearl tea was 325 yuan. The market price plummeted by 60 to 70 yuan to 100 yuan or more. There are also six pieces of tea today, which will be transported to Xiamen.

### Piece Goods: Harveytine Sells Particularly Well

Yesterday, Friday, the sale of wool fabrics in the market was lively, because the spring sales are timely, and local customers' purchases have also increased. Western suits and overcoats are becoming increasingly popular. Harveytine sold very well yesterday, and local customers continued to have a great demand for it, because new Western and Chinese clothing fabrics are now popular. Yesterday, the wholesale price of Western first-class plain gray striped Harveytine was 26 yuan per yard, the American-made Mason with Western characters on the selvage was 20 yuan, and the domestic Renli, Xiexin, Yinfeng, and British-owned Yihua Shen woven first-class were all sold at 19 yuan, second-class at 17.5 yuan, and third-class at 16 yuan.

Also, 80 pieces of piece goods will be exported today to Xiamen, and another 110 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Yarn and Linen Fabrics Rise

The prices of various wool fabrics have mostly remained firm. Yarn and linen fabrics, such as oilcloth, canvas, twill, sheeting, bag cloth, and interlining, have also repeatedly risen, because the import of foreign goods is even more scarce than that of wool fabrics, and the domestic factory goods woven in this port are also decreasing due to the lack of raw materials. Currently, the price of Western oilcloth is 9.5 yuan for the first-class and 9 yuan for the second-class. Genuine yellow and white all-linen cloth is sold for 17 yuan. Domestic first-class oilcloth single width is sold for 2.25 yuan, second-class for 1.89 yuan, and third-class for 1.56 yuan. White canvas with a width of 36 inches is sold for 1.75 yuan, and 29 inches for 1.34 yuan. Yellow twill Western goods are all sold for 2.34 yuan, and Dong goods Elephant Deer brand are sold for 1.25 yuan. Printed sheeting Western goods are sold for 2.8 yuan, Dong goods for 2.5 yuan, domestic first-class for 2 yuan, second-class for 1.75 yuan, Yongcheng soft interlining is sold for 1.2 yuan, and Yinfeng French Western interlining is 7.5 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Sells Well, Double Rise of 50 Cents

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be tight. The guild's marked price for 24 coarse sand spot goods rose another 50 cents, and transactions increased. New goods from foreign warehouses were 62 yuan, old goods were still 61.2 yuan, with over a thousand bags traded. Taikoo granular white B mark rose 50 cents, new goods from Western warehouses were 67.5 yuan, lower grades were discounted accordingly. For domestic sugar, Jianbang opened over a hundred bags of new diaoqing, at 49.2 yuan, and several hundred bags of old goods at 48.7 to 5 yuan. Xinghua gang opened special high-screened qing at 54 yuan to 53.5 yuan, followed by 51 yuan, a total of hundreds of bags, Xinghua qing hundred bags, 49.2 yuan. Arrivals included 948 bags of Diaoqing from Xiamen, 1,694 bags of red sand from Haikou, 400 bags of white sugar, 400 pieces of sliced qing, 69 bags of red sugar from Hong Kong, 374 pieces of sugar oil, and 14 pieces of Taiche sugar.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Ordinary Dried Branches See Loosening

Dried lichee due to sales have been stagnant and arrival stock is minimal. The lack of quoted prices has been prolonged. Despite limited stock on hand from trading firms some are eager to offload, resulting in loosening of selling prices. Remaining goods like yuanzhi and bianzhi stocks are not high and prices remain stable. High-grade glutinous rice branches 410 yuan, followed by 200 yuan to 190 yuan.

### Seafood: Shiitake Mushrooms Suddenly Plunge by Hundreds of Yuan

The sales of Shiitake mushrooms have been very dull recently and new stock arrivals has continued, hence market conditions are tired, resulting in an abrupt drop of several hundred yuan. Market firms opened at only 570 yuan. However, following this large drop, the price may stabilize temporarily.

### Coal: Coal Briquettes Increase in Price

Since coal briquettes have been sold at a flat rate and despite efforts of various government groups attempting to reduce material costs on coal dust and water cost nothing has been confirmed, causing deep affect to all coal briquette factories. A joint meeting was held yesterday (22nd) with the municipal commerce association and the coal and charcoal trade association, resulting in having to slightly increase prices in order to compensate. Therefore, starting yesterday (22nd) business discounts have been increased by 10 yuan, with price of Yitai, Junanyang, Pianhua coal briquettes starting at 120 yuan per ton, with a delivered price of 2 yuan per cart, retail price is 6.6 yuan per load, 16.5 yuan per 煤, totaling 132 yuan per ton.

### Finance: Silver Continues to Decline

A London telegram dated the 21st stated that the silver market was generally selling, lacking support, with little trading, and the market was flat. After closing, it was still stable. Silver bars for both near and far terms fell by 3.125. A New York silver telegram stated that US spot prices were still flat. Also, the Mumbai silver market was closed and there was no telegram.

### Imports and Exports: 3,000 Boxes of Xiamen Oranges Arrive

Although yesterday was a tomb-sweeping holiday and most industries were closed, the import and export of goods was still strong. Yesterday, 2,100 cans of raw oil arrived from Tianjin, 1,148 cans from Yantai, 200 pieces of soybean oil from Yantai, 295 barrels of rayon and 11 boxes of wool fabrics arrived from Hong Kong, and 3,795 boxes of oranges arrived from Xiamen.

### Statistics: Price Fluctuations - February

February was the time around the Spring Festival, the time when industry and commerce were generally closing and then reopening. Under these conditions, prices were initially stable, but then rose sharply, and the extent of this sharp rise was seemingly endless. The prices of rice and coal were especially frightening, and as a result, the prices of all other goods also tended to rise. Today's prices in Shanghai have already exceeded the cost price by a large margin. This phenomenon is really a serious blow to the normal industrial and commercial operations under Shanghai's wartime prosperity, and of course, it is even more difficult for ordinary people to maintain their livelihoods.

According to statistics of price increases published in newspapers in February, there were a total of 102 cases, that is, 102 industrial and commercial factories increased prices. Analyzing the goods that increased in price, there were 13 categories, including food and beverages, clothing, medicines, electrical and metal products, daily necessities, cosmetics, cultural and printing products, packaging products, cleaning products, sanitary products, transportation products, civil engineering products, and decorative products. Among them, food and beverages accounted for the first place with 19 kinds, clothing accounted for the second place with 12 kinds, medicines and daily necessities each accounted for the third place with 8 kinds, electrical and metal products, cultural and printing products, and transportation products each accounted for the fourth place with 6 kinds, cosmetics, packaging products, and decorative products each accounted for the fifth place with 2 kinds, and cleaning products, sanitary products, and civil engineering products each accounted for the last place with 1 kind. Here, the names of the goods that increased in price and the industrial and commercial factories that increased in price are described separately below.

(1) Beer: Shanghai Beer and Jardine Beer, increased by 11 yuan per box, draft beer, increased by 15 cents per liter (Shanghai and Jardine companies) bottled 48 or 72, increased by 35 yuan per box, draft beer increased by 85 cents per liter (Chinese factory)

(2) Local Wine: Prices increased twice, first, large bottles were changed to 1.2 yuan, medium bottles 64 cents, large bottles of Yujinshu, increased to 5.5 yuan per dozen, medium bottles 3.2 yuan, second, local wine large bottles increased again to 1.5 yuan, medium bottles 80 cents, large bottles of Yujinshu 7 yuan per dozen, medium bottles 4.5 yuan, wine 7.2 yuan per dozen (Chinese company) (To be continued)

### Re-transcribing Old News, Sixty-Seven Years Ago () (See This Newspaper of the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi in the Late Qing Dynasty)

Strange Argument (2)

If all the prostitutes in Shanghai are sold off, it will undoubtedly affect the market. Here is a good method, that is, to distribute donation books to brothels, so that each prostitute persuades her guests to donate according to the book, and a dime or two can also make up the number. Every week, a new book is used to replace the old one, and the money collected and the donated books are taken away. The amount should not be small. It is now estimated that there are 20,000 people in the four classes of brothels, so if this method is implemented, each prostitute can persuade her guests to donate 5 silver dollars per week, and with four periods per month, there will be 40,000 yuan, which is not better than pawning and selling to replenish the treasury. Let's take pawning and selling as an example, as discussed, 30 taels, 20 taels to 5 yuan. If the 书寓 are calculated at 30 taels, there are only a hundred people out of 20,000, which is only 3,000 taels. There are three to five hundred 长三, calculated at 20 taels, which is only 10,000 taels. There are two to three thousand 私, calculated at 10 taels, which is only 30,000 taels. The rest are all 花烟间 and the like, generally calculated at 5 taels, which is only 82,000 taels. The total is 125,000 taels of silver. If they are ordered to solicit donations, 400,000 yuan can be obtained every month. Moreover, the money comes from the guests, and it is entered in small amounts every day. Even if you know ten prostitutes and go to each place once a day, it will only cost one or two yuan per day, which is not harmful to the guests. Moreover, the pawn price is at most 30 taels, and even small brokers can barely manage to get the best. If after buying them, they are not settled at home, what will happen to the cases of escape and abduction? If treacherous people tamper with the matter, and those who open halls and secret dens and private bureaus collude with ruffians to buy them back, and after a month or so, change their names and sell themselves into prostitution, and the names of 书寓, 长三, 么二, 花烟 are still listed in houses, then what should the officials do? The difficulty of this proposal is obvious to all; as for the argument of ordering prostitutes to solicit donations, it is not impossible to implement.

### Career Circle

— Ying Jin

Changing careers is like changing lives. Under the watchful eyes of unfamiliar faces, I cast all my thoughts into a secluded corner. I stir like a grub.

"Seeing people's faces but not their hearts." For the past half-month, I have been carrying this suspicion as I scrutinized every unfamiliar colleague, silently observing their complexions. Yet, I still cannot fathom the different hearts hidden beneath these different masks.

However, summing it up, there is one common focal point here: "Selfishness" has become a prevalent phenomenon in modern society.

They use all sorts of insidious tricks, plotting and scheming against each other, attacking and squeezing out competition. To superiors, they offer flowery words to consolidate their own position. To those not affiliated with them, they are sarcastic and evasive, fearing their own advantages will be seized by others. Yet, their faces always wear that fixed smile.

I suddenly remember a common saying: "A dagger hidden in a smile." Suddenly, it seems that every smiling face is spitting out a knife, and I have become the target of all.

At the end of the month, the salary is announced, still so meager. Is changing careers ultimately better? I myself cannot answer.

"Making money without effort, expending effort without making money!" Another proverb keeps swirling in my ears...

From one professional department to another, you still can't jump out of the career circle, and the entire career circle is always like a dark abyss.

When will the labor people put in equal the rewards they receive? When will a glimmer of dawn break through the pitch-black career circle? I curse this incurable modern society!

### A Record of Old Man Feces

— Ji Ang

Old Man Feces' family name is Deng, his given name is Dun Tie. After middle age, he abandoned his family name and adopted the alias Old Man Feces. Many people feel surprised about his choice of name. Regarding this, Old Man Feces' explanation is: "The character 'Feces' contains the meaning of sweeping away, and does not only refer to animal excrement. Furthermore, feces itself is not inherently disgusting. Moreover, I also use the character 'feces' to test people's psychology. A certain wealthy man once asked me to write a large hanging scroll, saying he was willing to pay double the fee, with the only request being that I not use the alias Old Man Feces, because he felt that a 'feces' character in a magnificent and splendid living room was somewhat unseemly. But I ultimately politely declined his good intentions, because I felt that he was not a true lover of my calligraphy. If he truly loved my work, he would not be so concerned about whether or not my alias employed the character 'feces.'"

Old Man Feces has been renowned throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River for his exceptional calligraphy and engraving skills for nearly thirty years. He is very strict with himself, getting up every day at dawn to engage in writing and seal carving, which he has never interrupted for decades. Moreover, because he usually pays attention to exercise, his wrist strength is particularly strong. The seals he produces are full of genuine energy and deeply possess masculine beauty. Similarly, his calligraphy is bold and unrestrained, impossible to look at directly. Feng Yuxiang greatly admired his artistic endeavors and once asked him to write the entire fourth lecture of the Three Principles of the People, to be engraved in stone at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum. In addition to seal carving, Old Man Feces also excels at painting bamboo. Recently, I visited him, and he was painting a bamboo painting, on which he inscribed his own seven-character quatrain: "North of the river, the spring flowers are extraordinarily charming; south of the river, the wild bamboo soars into the azure sky. Don't laugh at the broken branches; they don't need a long wind to cross the bridge." The wording is alert and insightful, deeply possessing the meaning of poems of admonishment, proving that Old Man Feces is an artist with a very rich patriotic heart, and not just a poet who only knows how to sing of the wind and moon.

From March 22nd, he will hold a joint exhibition of his and his students' seal carvings, calligraphy, and paintings on the fourth floor of the Da Xin Company on Nanjing Road, lasting for five days. For those who do not yet have a deep understanding of his artistic achievements, don't miss this good opportunity to appreciate them.

### Suffering from the Pain of Morbid Psychology

Mr. Jia Yin:

Since you took over as editor of "Free Talk," the articles in "Free Talk" have caught my attention. Every article you have written and selected is "substantive," able to grasp the core of the facts, find the root of the truth, and give people good inspiration. In particular, articles discussing psychology, like the previous article by Mr. Mo Ming, "The Morbid Psychology of Competitive Sports," resonated deeply with my heart. Because I am someone who has indirectly and directly suffered the pain of morbid psychology!

I am a victim of family oppression. The person oppressing me is someone who is psychologically abnormal and mentally unsound. The reason she is like this is also because she suffered in the old family in her early years, and it has harmed my whole life! Since childhood, I have lived an inhuman life like a prisoner—but she thinks it's a very good life, she considers herself to be a very kind person—she doesn't allow me to go out, nor does she want me to do anything. Her thoughts and measures are so strange that it's hard to believe; but the fact is indeed so. She looks at everything from the dark side and seeks out troubles all day long. A low-pressure atmosphere enshrouds the family year after year, making people afraid and suffocated! In such an adverse living situation, I had no choice but to find spiritual comfort through self-study, and I wanted to use knowledge as a tool to strive for the future. Unexpectedly, my body, due to the influence of an unreasonable life, is very weak. Coupled with excessive hard work, it eventually resulted in the dreaded tuberculosis of the lower limb joints (the destructive power of tuberculosis bacteria is really terrible. The anti-tuberculosis movement, as you said, should be actively promoted. I believe that the anti-tuberculosis movement should not be limited to pulmonary tuberculosis; other tuberculosis—joint tuberculosis, spinal tuberculosis, intestinal tuberculosis, etc.—should all be included in the scope of anti-tuberculosis). Having become ill, it was her morbid psychology at work again, making one mistake after another, until the end, my lower limbs completely lost the ability to move. Ten years have passed since then, and the depth of the suffering I have endured goes without saying. In addition to the physical pain, there is also the pain caused by my own morbid psychology. Originally, I had lived in a gloomy and cold atmosphere since childhood. As a result of high mental pressure, I became abnormally timid and suffered from a deep-seated phobia. At the slightest provocation, I would experience palpitations and anxiety. Knowing that this was not something to worry about, I still worried unnecessarily; knowing that I should not live such an adverse life, I dared not resist, dared not demand improvement. The feeling of terror made me discouraged before the battle. My reason often fought with my phobia. The contradictory pain often made me think of suicide, feeling that there was no way to relieve my pain except to destroy my nerves. But suicide was not something someone as cowardly as me could do. So I had no choice but to suffer in this contradictory pain! I also knew that the only way to cure this morbid psychology was to change the living environment and stay away from the object of fear. But who will change the environment for you? Changing the environment requires your own strong will and fearless spirit.

Under the double torment of mental and physical pain, my life is only a matter of time! The severity of the harm of morbid psychology cannot be known in detail by those who have not experienced it themselves. Most people only pay attention to the madmen whose psychological abnormalities are fully exposed, and ignore those whose morbidities are hidden and not very obvious. They don't know that the obviously morbid madmen will be locked up, and although they suffer personally, they will not harm others; the most dangerous are those whose morbidities are not very obvious. Saying they are foolish is not quite right, saying they are mad is not quite right. They can still hold the power to rule others, and they can do whatever they want, and no one will correct them, and no one can control them. There are countless such people in this world, and the severity of the harm is truly unimaginable! I deeply hope that those engaged in mental health movements will pay more attention to these semi-psychotic patients.

I have never wanted to complain to others, for fear that people will not understand my morbid psychology, and fear that people will scold me for being weak and useless. This letter was written after much hesitation! I wish you

Health A cowardly female杞人

29, 3, 18.

Ms. Qi Ren:

After reading your well-written letter, we feel very moved and sympathetic. Like the spiritual pain you have suffered, we believe it cannot be fully understood by those who have not experienced it themselves. As you said, the danger of people with psychological abnormalities that are not very obvious is often great. People engaged in mental health movement work should make more efforts in this area.

In any environment, pessimism is of no help. Although you have suffered a ten-year prison-like life, we believe that you are not without hope, please don't think that you are finished.

In the United States, there was once a twelve-year-old girl named Jia Xidi who suffered from a very serious spinal disease. Not only could she not go out, but even getting out of bed would cause her great physical pain. For people like her, some people may think that she is finished. But no, she asked her mother to read the newspaper to her every day. One day, she heard about the difficult living conditions of female workers in the city and suggested to her mother that she find a way to give the female workers a few weeks of vacation each year to rest in a summer camp, and at the same time they could also get wages. Her mother listened to her and finally made the female workers' summer camp a success. Because of her lack of discouragement, hundreds of female workers are living a better life every year. Although she is no longer alive, her "Jia Xidi Female Workers' Summer Camp" still exists. Therefore, it is up to people to make things happen. Difficult environments and spiritual pain are meant for people to overcome, and we also believe that they can be overcome to some extent.

In the past, you may have been living in loneliness and pain. But, from today onwards, when you read this newspaper, tens of thousands of compatriots in Shanghai are being moved by your letter, and they are all expressing their sympathy to you. In spirit, they have all become your friends, and they are also expecting something from you.

The Shanghai Mental Hygiene Promotion Association is organized by Chinese and foreign people who hope to make this world a better world. They are not only interested in the mental hygiene movement, but also enthusiastic about social work. If you are willing, we can introduce you to a few friends from the association, I think they will be very happy to visit you. They may be able to give you some help with your family environment, illness, and fear psychology. If you are willing, please give us your mailing address, we will be responsible for keeping your mailing address secret. Jia Yin

Due to her superb acting skills in "Of Human Bondage" and "Longing," Betty Davis, who had been suppressed and unsuccessful for several years, jumped to the throne of the 1940 movie queen. Her success is by no means accidental. It is worth taking out what she once said to prove it:

She once said to people in person: "I am an extremely selfish person, I have no so-called feminine virtues at all. However, I believe that a woman who wants to become famous must do this: she should laugh when she is happy, and cry when she is sad. In short, everything must be done as she pleases, without being interfered with or prevented by anyone.

"I will never be as easily bound by customs as ordinary women. I don't want to raise children, let alone start a family. I don't want to be entangled in any events. Therefore, I don't sign long-term contracts, in order to avoid film companies assigning me to shoot those films that 'I think are unconscious' or 'I don't think I can handle'. But, this is not disrespecting the audience who love and care for me, I am very grateful for their enthusiasm. However, I believe that no matter what—especially career—should be based on one's own will and interests first!"

After reading the above remarks, you can know the origin of Betty's success. This is not only applicable to her alone, not only limited to Hollywood, but is actually the "road to success" shared by all female film practitioners in the world!

### Recent News from the Tianjin Pear Garden

— Xi Sen

The play "Spinning Cotton" is originally a small joke play, which was not enough to attract the audience at first. Last year, Wu Suqiu came south at the invitation of Xin Geng and became popular with this play. This time, Suqiu is still well received in Tianjin for this play. Therefore, Tianjin Pear Garden also regards this play as a first-class popular play. In fact, Suqiu's play is colorful, with a mixture of male and female roles, and she is full of elegance and grace. She performs on stage in casual clothes, which should be able to overturn the masses. Recently, there is a female amateur, the owner of Bi Jun Hall, who also performed this play once at the New Central Theater. Although her singing and acting are skilled, compared with Suqiu's complexity, her one role, one song, and one ditty are far simpler. There are two famous female amateurs in Tianjin, both named Hall Owner, one is Jin Yun, and the other is Bi Jun. Jin Yun is the niece of the late President Xu Juren and the wife of Yao Sejun, who has been fond of Peking Opera since childhood. She has written and directed new plays such as "Seven Days of Fate," which are sad and charming, and is regarded by enthusiasts as "the female patriarch of the amateur world." Bi Jun is the niece of a certain Yang who served as the head of the finance department and is also known as the "female amateur saint." The two female amateurs are both from famous families, and their acting skills are equally excellent. When they perform occasionally, they always cause a sensation in Tianjin. It is really a rare thing!

After Suqiu stopped performing at the China Grand Theater, the next to follow will be Jin Shaoshan, Jiang Miaoxiang, and others. Shaoshan had many scandals in Beijing. This time, he was invited to Tianjin, and it is said that he played a role in regulating the atmosphere. As for Miaoxiang, he was invited by Shaoshan to help. He will come to Shanghai with Yanqiu in the near future. After Dr. Mei Xiaoshi retired to Hong Kong, Miaoxiang has performed with Cheng, Shang, and Xun, and he is not lonely. Therefore, Miaoxiang recently wrote a poem saying, "I support three famous female dan, and I will never worry about eating, drinking, and wearing from now on." The implied meaning may also be a sense of leisurely self-satisfaction. Tianjin's box office was at its peak between the years of the Republic of China 15, producing famous amateurs such as Liu Shudu, Wang Yusheng, Zhu Zuozhou, Ye Weiyou, Yao Xiyun, etc., no less than thirty or forty people. They each have their own strengths in civil and military Kunqu operas. Every time they perform, they cause a sensation in the city. Even after more than ten years, those who talk about amateur opera can still talk about it with relish. Now, only Kai Luan and Yong Yu are still standing strong, and their talents and organization are enough to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors. Otherwise, they all have a sense of silent obscurity. This is also a glorious history of Tianjin's amateur world.

### Smoke and Flame of Scarlet Blood

— Qi Hua

"Smoke and Flame of Scarlet Blood" is a western movie similar to "Outlaws of the Marsh." In the "bad land" of Petru Nai Gai City, hooligans are rampant, but under the sheriff's loyalty to his duty and the people's hatred of evil, the great harm in the area is finally eradicated. Although Western movies all emphasize the deeds of heroes and beauties, they also tell us that those who use deceit and violence to dominate everything will inevitably be destroyed by the torch of justice.

"Smoke and Flame of Scarlet Blood," co-operated by Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart, two actors with absolutely different personalities, is naturally full of humorous scenes. For example, when James first arrived in Petru Nai Gai City, Marlene Dietrich and Ina Merkel's fierce fight, and the silent scenes between the two male and female protagonists, are all incredibly humorous.

Director George Marshall's grasp of the atmosphere of the whole film is exceptionally strong. The introduction of the bar scene at the beginning, the appearance of gamblers Gan and Franzi, and Dai Shichui Lai's dealing with this group of villains, are all developing in a lively and humorous melody, and the depiction of characters such as "drunkard" Hua Shu is also vivid enough.

### Movie People · Movie Affairs

Following "Qi Jiguang," Guo Moruo recently co-authored a new script "Mask Emperor" aimed at a certain puppet. The play has been uniformly performed by large and small theater troupes in Chongqing, Kunming, and other places. The whole play depicts the ugly state of the puppet, penetrating to the bone, and it is also rumored that the script will be filmed by the Central Film Studio.

Director Ma Xuweibang's long-planned "Sequel to Midnight Song" has been decided to be filmed after Wang Yin's "Yang Guifei" is completed. According to reports, the play has been decided to be starred by Wang Yin, Tan Ying, and Wang Naidong.

It is said that Wang Renmei, Jin Yan, and others have arrived safely in Hong Kong from Kunming a few days ago and will jointly join a certain company in Hong Kong to star in a new film.

The three anti-Japanese war news films No. 34, 35, and 36 recently completed by the Central Photography Studio will be transported to foreign countries for public screening in the shortest possible time.

The famous movie star Li Qinian, who was once rumored to join Yi Hua Company, is still in Hong Kong and has two Cantonese films that need to be filmed urgently, so it is difficult to come to Shanghai in the short term.

Bored literati, supporting roles in newspapers; rich masters, ordering plays on stage; but since the occupation, I don't know what the situation is like.

### Mulan Joins the Army

— Lyric Dispute

In the theme song of the film "Mulan Joins the Army," there is a line called "The sun rises and fills the world," and it is said that this is also one of the reasons why the film was burned in Chongqing. Indeed, singing "The sun rises" at this time and place can easily be misunderstood. A reporter from the Hai Xing News Agency asked the producer about this issue. The reply was as follows: "This song is Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's original lyrics. When we got the lyrics, we expected that it would cause misunderstandings. We sent a letter to Mr. Ouyang to change it. The reply was that it could not be changed at all. It is said that this is a folk song that has been popular in the countryside of southern Hunan since Emperor Chongzhen's death. It has something to entrust, so it has not been changed." Xia Yan, the editor of the Guilin Salvation Daily, once wrote an article on this matter, saying that Xia Wancang changed the original work, and Xia Jun shouted grievances and decided to send Ouyang's original manuscript in his own handwriting to Xia Yan in the form of photos to explain his responsibility.
