Editorial

### Progress in American and Soviet Harmony

Last night's news indicated that French Indochina suddenly became tense again the day before yesterday. There are four main reasons for this confluence of events: First, the war between England and Germany in Europe, which will decide who is superior, is imminent. Its impact will naturally extend to all places. Everyone and every country is using this as an important opportunity to seize benefits for themselves, and it is also a crucial juncture before the decisive battle to determine everything. Indochina is no exception, and naturally has a painful reaction. Second, Japan's Konoe returned to power as Prime Minister for the second time, revealing his diplomatic policy. It is said that the key points of the policy lie in strengthening its Axis relationship with Germany and Italy, and adjusting its relations with the United States and the Soviet Union. However, he did not mention how to deal with England and France. Everyone can understand that there is an unstated meaning, which is a strong hint of threat to England and France. England and France are already frightened birds. Unable to see through Japan's empty threats, and unable to do anything, they cannot help but change color at the mere mention of a tiger. Indochina, helpless and dependent on others, should naturally be tense. Third, since Indochina yielded to Japan and blocked transportation to China, Nishihara, a major general dispatched to Indochina by Japan in the name of the "Supervisory Chairman," recently negotiated with the French authorities in Indochina to a near-decisive stage, and returned to Japan the day before yesterday to report on his duties. Any negotiation will naturally have disagreements. It is reported that Konoe's specific strategies for France and Indochina will be based on Nishihara's report. Indochina is uneasy, considering its future destiny. Fourth, it is reported that Japan is extorting aviation bases from the Indochina authorities, demanding to borrow a route to attack Yunnan in China from Indochina. Attacking Yunnan and taking Indochina with one stone would kill two birds, and Indochina would naturally understand.

We do not believe that the reasons for the recent tension in Indochina mentioned above are unexpected storms. On the contrary, it can indeed be said that since the invasion crime in the Far East, up to the outbreak of the European War last year, China took the brunt, and has laid a bright and great foundation for itself through resolute resistance. Other countries, to this day, have mostly tasted the bitter fruit of failing to remedy the situation. Tracing back to the cause, none of them were not due to focusing on empty words in the past, neglecting practical matters, and tolerating the growth of evil causes for a long time. It is too late to regret the extreme pain. The matter is extremely sympathetic, but it is not an unexpected storm.

Regret is always too late. What is the use of simply being heartbroken? The reason why it is still worth pointing this out today is that the past is gone, but the future can be pursued! If France is like this, other countries should take this as a warning and not continue to delay and tolerate. Even in the case of France, it was hoped that the surrender and embargo would allow for an attempt at compromise and delay the disaster. Who knew that insatiable demands would follow closely, becoming more and more intense. Taking this as a warning, be clear about the futility of past surrenders, and resolutely stop continuous compromises. French people must not be discouraged, thinking that they are forced into this situation and blaming it on a lack of strength. Know that lowering your ambitions and surrendering, hoping for a compromise, will still result in destruction and ultimately fail to preserve anything! Do not say temporary, do not say transitional. A temporary grievance is a permanently broken transition. Know that the only way to preserve Indochina is to be unyielding, sincere, maintain Sino-French friendship, and look forward to China's victory. As for the attitude of the United Kingdom, although it is not higher in nature than France, it certainly retains a difference of fifty steps from a hundred steps. The mistakes of the past are before us, and the warnings are not far away! If the United Kingdom continues to attempt compromise, it may as well wait in Burma for the current tense situation in Indochina to occur.

The only ones with the power to reverse the situation and yet have not used it, leading to regret, are the United States and the Soviet Union. Today, the United States and the Soviet Union are in an advantageous position, which France cannot even hope to reach. However, not long ago, England and France were not far behind the United States and the Soviet Union, and they never imagined today's situation. Lessons do not necessarily have to be learned through personal pain, and wisdom often comes from observing others. Shouldn't the people of the United States and the Soviet Union take England and France as a warning today and imagine the future? The United States and the Soviet Union are superior to England and France today, and superior to any other country. However, if it is said that England and France were ill due to past delays and toleration, and that the United States and the Soviet Union can continue to nurture problems and tigers and will eventually have no worries, this certain optimism must be boldness outside the realm of wisdom. When a neighbor's house catches fire and the flames are raging, how can one be indifferent to the safety of one's own home and coldly sit idly by? To contain the flames, cooperation is needed, but before today, the United States and the Soviet Union have been watching each other.

Why watch? Some say that their ambitions are different and they cannot work together. Some say that they have their own hidden worries and cannot attend to others. Some say that they have their own confidence and are fearless. Some say that past rifts are difficult to eliminate. Some say that future interests are actually contradictory. Some say no, all are wrong. Seeing other countries fighting each other, scheming, vying for dominance, their deeds are not worth emulating, their people cannot be taught. They cannot help but have a thought of gloating over their misfortune. Because they are evenly matched, they cannot help but deceive each other. Who will be the last to enter the arena, who will be the last to control. Therefore, they watch and do not move forward. All these miscellaneous theories have their own viewpoints, but they can only explain the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union towards the European situation, not towards the Far East. Regarding the Far East, not only the United States or the Soviet Union, but also England, France, Germany, and Italy, no country's interests are actually consistent with those of the invaders in the Far East. On the contrary, anti-aggression in the Far East is in everyone's best interests. England, France, Germany, and Italy each have their own urgent matters and can be set aside for the time being. However, the actions of the United States and the Soviet Union towards the Far East, which have been close to observation before today, mean that other than the opportunities for cooperation not yet being ripe, there is no other reason, no other explanation. Today, with the United States' sole permission for gasoline to be transported to the Soviet Union, and with the close contact of the US-Soviet trade agreement, comparing this to the attitude of the United States towards other parties, one cannot but think that under the emotion of understanding, the United States and the Soviet Union are promoting the opportunities for cooperation. And the deepening crisis in Indochina reflects the spread of flames and explains the necessity of cooperation. Early maturation is certainly what the world eagerly hopes for!

### Klare's Visit to Matsuoka - Anglo-Japanese Relations Tense Again - Arrest of British Nationals the Result of a Sudden Change in Japanese Policy - British Government Has Twice Protested to Japan

Tokyo - The Japanese Foreign Ministry recently announced that negotiations between British Ambassador to Japan Klare and Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka regarding Anglo-Japanese relations are still continuing. Their discussions began on Saturday and may continue thereafter. On Saturday, Klare told Matsuoka that although Britain is striving to improve friendship, Anglo-Japanese relations have not improved. (Associated Press dispatch of the 29th)

Tokyo - The British government has protested to Japan twice for the arrest of British personnel in Japan. British Ambassador Klare, after sending a written protest to the Japanese Foreign Minister, also made an oral protest, demanding that the Japanese side explain the reasons for the arrest of the British nationals. (Associated Press dispatch of the 29th)

London - Authoritative sources reported last night that Britain will formally protest to Japan over the arrest of ten British nationals in Japan at the end of last week. Following reports that Reuters reporter Cox was arrested last Saturday, there were reports that nine more British nationals were arrested. Official confirmation of this was received here last night from Tokyo. Well-informed sources believe that these arrests will cause a new tension in Anglo-Japanese relations after the resolution of the Tianjin British Concession issue and the Yunnan-Burma Road Agreement. According to reports received here indirectly, the ten British nationals were arrested simultaneously in five locations in Japan, for reasons unknown. It is believed here that these arrests are the result of a sudden change in the diplomatic policy of the new Japanese cabinet. British newspapers have prominently reported on this matter, and pointed out that the arrest occurred while British Ambassador to Tokyo Sir Klare was meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka. British reports state that the British ambassador complained to Matsuoka that although he was striving to adjust Anglo-Japanese relations, relations between the two countries seemed to be deteriorating. It is said that the British ambassador once pointed out that Britain's agreement to close the Yunnan-Burma Road clearly demonstrated Britain's intention to improve relations with Japan. Sir Klare also raised external rumors that the new Japanese cabinet had a tendency to cooperate with the Rome-Berlin Axis. He further asked whether the current situation, due to these external rumors, would allow Britain and Japan to continue negotiations along the previous path. It is reported that Matsuoka replied that Japan's current foreign policy is under consideration, and therefore he could not give an answer. (Associated Press dispatch of the 29th)

Tokyo - Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma said this evening that in view of the increasing activities of foreign spies and conspiracy organizations recently, the military police arrested various components of British spies throughout Japan on Saturday, July 27. (Reuter's dispatch of the 29th)

Local News - There is still no news about the other British nationals arrested in various parts of Japan on Saturday besides Cox. However, according to what was heard in Shanghai today, another British national, Mr. Wu Lai of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, was arrested in Kobe. Thus, the total number of British nationals arrested has reached eleven. It is reported that British Ambassador Klare visited Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Matsumiya for this matter today. It is said that Matsumiya has agreed to try to expedite the police's interrogation of all the arrested British nationals. Today, rumors circulated that the ten British businessmen arrested were related to espionage cases, but whether Cox's arrest was due to the same suspicion or whether there was a special incident is still unclear.

### Cox Died Suddenly After Falling from a Building During Interrogation - Japanese Army and Justice Ministries Issue Communiqué - Saying He Was Suspected of Espionage

Tokyo - According to Domei News Agency, Cox, the chief correspondent for Reuters in Tokyo, was detained by the military police in Tokyo for unknown reasons on Saturday. While being interrogated on the second floor of the military police headquarters, he jumped from the second floor this afternoon and was injured, and died of his injuries one hour and forty-five minutes later. (Reuter's dispatch of the 29th)

Tokyo - This evening, the Japanese Army and Justice Ministries issued a joint communiqué stating that Cox broke away from his guards in the Gendarmerie Department and rushed to the window. Before he could be stopped, he had already fallen. However, the exact nature of the fatal injuries was not announced. The joint communiqué also stated that Cox was detained on suspicion of espionage. It is said that Cox publicly released information important to the Japanese Navy and Army. This was the first time the Japanese authorities broke their silence after banning the release of information about the arrest of British nationals on Saturday. According to the Japanese authorities, a short note addressed to his wife was found in Cox's room, with touching words written in pencil on an envelope. The content conveyed by the Japanese side is as follows: "Regarding the rent, ask Reuters; the funds can be inquired from the [Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation] Bank. I know what is best. [Wife's name] is always my only love. I am being treated well, but there is no doubt as to how things will turn out." There has been no announcement regarding the news of the arrest of other British nationals, nor is it allowed to be transmitted from Japan. (Reuter's dispatch of the 29th)

Consequences of British Appeasement Policy

Chinese sources in Chongqing explained that the recent large-scale arrests of British nationals in Japan and Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka's brief reply to the British ambassador's inquiry about Japanese foreign policy were all inevitable consequences of Britain's appeasement policy towards Japan. Following Britain's agreement to close the Burma Road, its appeasement policy not only failed to prevent Japan from continuing to encroach on British interests in the Far East, but also isolated Japan and encouraged it to adopt a stronger policy towards third countries in the Far East. Britain's concessions have revealed Britain's weakness. Only by adopting a more resolute attitude and continuing to provide assistance to China can Japan's aggression in the Far East be curbed. (Reuter's dispatch of the 29th)

### Pan Gongzhan - Speech in Chongqing - China and Czechoslovakia

Chongqing - Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, said in a speech here recently that there will not and cannot be a Munich-like deal in the Far East. He meant that Britain, without the assistance of the United States and the Soviet Union, cannot conclude a Munich Agreement in the Far East. However, when Anglo-Japanese talks began in Tokyo a year ago, the United States terminated its trade agreement with Japan. After the closure of the Burma Road, the United States immediately included the oil and iron being transported to Japan under a licensing system. As for the Soviet Union, it has consistently provided China with material assistance for the past three years. It is important to know that China's position is very different from that of Czechoslovakia, because Czechoslovakia has no set policy and relies solely on foreign aid, while China relies on its rapidly strengthened strength over the past three years of war and is determined to resist. (Reuter's dispatch of the 29th)

### China Does Not Feel a Shortage of Gasoline

Chongqing - Transportation circles recently stated that the transfer of all American transport vehicles from the southwest route to the northwest route is underway. Although the government has decided to restrict the use of gasoline from August 1, because more than 10,000 camels and trucks from the United States and the Soviet Union are transporting goods at full speed from the Soviet border, there is actually no shortage of gasoline. President Chiang has ordered a strict ban on the use of unnecessary gasoline. Currently, each government agency is only allowed to have one vehicle, and officials' families are not allowed to use government vehicles. Violators will be punished. The use of private cars is completely prohibited. (Associated Press dispatch of the 29th)

### Central Daily News Review – British-German War Situation – German Forces Still Have Difficulty Winning

Chongqing – The Central Daily News published an article this morning discussing the possibility of German forces invading Britain, stating, “Based on careful research, Germany faces insurmountable difficulties in this endeavor. Britain remains a strong naval power in the Atlantic. Although the French fleet cannot assist Britain, the British fleet alone can control the main sea lanes. On the other hand, Germany must defend its coastline from the Spanish border to northern Norway, and its navy is weak in protecting this coastline. In the current situation, the Italian fleet cannot leave the Mediterranean to participate in the attack on Britain, and the Italian coast is also vulnerable to attack. In summary, Britain, with its strong fleet and effective cooperation with its air force, can defeat a continental power.” (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)

### Pan-American Nations Unanimously – Pass the "Havana Declaration" – Avoid Transfer of Territories in the Western Hemisphere – Assembly Approves and Will Sign Today

Havana – The Pan-American Conference, when the representatives of the 21 nations unanimously passed the Havana Resolution against the transfer of European territories in the Western Hemisphere today, actually completed its work. Only two formal actions have not yet been implemented, namely the approval and signing of the "Havana Declaration." The declaration is expected to be approved today and signed tomorrow. US Secretary of State Hull, a leader in supporting the resolution on the territorial issue, stated today, "We have completely cleared our agenda." In today's full secret meeting, representatives are expected to express their formal support for the resolution. In tomorrow's public plenary meeting, representatives will reiterate their support and sign the declaration. Representatives have repeatedly stated that such friendly and cooperative discussions among many countries would be impossible in other parts of the world, and that the American continent, as a result of the various resolutions of this conference, has merged into a single continent, combining its military and economic elements. These resolutions are based on the principle of "all for one, one for all." Once the resolutions of the assembly are signed, especially the approval of the Western Hemisphere Security Treaty, these resolutions will become part of the basic laws of each of the 21 nations, and the US Navy will legally become the first line of defense for the American continent. The main points of the provisions regarding European territories in the Western Hemisphere are as follows: (1) The American nations recognize the need for European territories in the Western Hemisphere to seek their own security, do not recognize the situation of forcibly seizing the territories, and do not recognize their transfer to foreign countries. Any actions regarding these lands cannot be considered as territorial expansion in the Americas and should be returned to their original owners at an appropriate time. If this is not possible, their independence should be recognized when they are capable of self-government. (2) If it is necessary to take over these lands, a committee of three members of different nationalities should be appointed to manage their economic, educational, and social needs. These three members should be dispatched by each republic, one from each country. The management committee has the right to request assistance from the army and navy when necessary. (3) The tax revenue of the managed area should be used entirely in that area. If there is a shortfall, it will be provided by the government led by the management committee and reimbursed by the American republics after approval in the future.

Havana – The Pan-American Assembly's Committee on Maintaining Peace unanimously passed the "Havana Declaration" yesterday.

New York – According to the New York Bulletin, the agreement established by the Pan-American Assembly will likely deal a direct and practical blow to international affairs. This Havana Conference can be considered an important victory for Western Hemisphere policy, which has become the cornerstone of President Roosevelt's diplomacy. The agreed-upon method was firmly adopted by the Latin American representatives, and the totalitarian countries, which deeply believed that the conference would fail, will now be disappointed. The New York Times expressed satisfaction with the results of the conference, saying that the agreement cannot solve the urgent problems currently facing the Americas. If we can now contain Hitler's victory in Europe, the problem of economic defense in the Western Hemisphere will be greatly reduced, and the problem of military significance will be difficult to sustain. Therefore, if we ignore the main problem, our policy will be like people being busy scooping water out of a boat while forgetting the important work of plugging the leaks.

Cooperation Committee Passes – Chilean Economic Proposal

Cuban Capital – The Pan-American Conference Economic Cooperation Committee recently passed a proposal put forward by Chile, advocating that Latin American countries take over public utilities companies under the jurisdiction of merchants outside the Americas, which are at risk of being seized by merchants from other countries. This proposal contains a general economic defense plan and will be submitted to the Permanent Economic Committee to determine how to take over these companies. When the head of the Chilean delegation, Hinake, put forward the proposal, he stated that the acquisition of these companies should be stipulated by the constitutions of the countries concerned and can be acquired through confiscation or other means. This is a necessary step to prevent overseas forces from continuing to invade. Most of the public utilities companies in Latin America are owned by British, French, and Dutch merchants.

The court will pay special attention to the fact that the French General Staff adopted a defensive posture for nine months, waiting for the German attack, and Gut's charges are the most numerous, including embezzling public funds and supplying military supplies to Spain. The French authorities are keeping the actions of the above people strictly secret. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 29th)

Vichy – French Minister of Industry and Labor Belin told reporters yesterday that if France cannot restore all its work within the shortest possible time, France will encounter the most difficult period. Industries in the unoccupied areas of France have not been able to resume operations, resulting in a sharp increase in unemployment. The number of unemployed has increased even more since the demobilization of the army. At the same time, the food problem is extremely difficult to solve because a large number of refugees have not been able to return to northern France. This is due to the lack of gasoline fuel, which makes it impossible to transport supplies. Belin continued, "I will suggest to the cabinet to prohibit the waste of gasoline, and violators will be severely punished." (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 29th)

Although it was previously rumored that the French government would meet with the German side on the condition that Marshal Pétain and his aide, Laval, return to Paris, this matter depends on political considerations. This is something that Pétain must consider. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)

Vichy – Action Française published an article by Puaseau, which was skeptical about the establishment of the French Unified Party, saying that the party would not achieve much and could not be compared with the large parties of totalitarian countries.

### Large-Scale German Offensive in Preparation on Many Fronts, Circle Around England Shrinking Daily, Soviet Newspaper Says German-Italian Cooperation Successful

Rome: Ansa Gui, editor of the "Electric News," gave a speech to the Italian military yesterday, stating that anyone who asks when the large-scale invasion of England will begin proves that they have failed to understand the facts of recent weeks. The invasion of England is not a simple matter of landing hundreds of thousands of troops in England and succeeding. It must be based on the military plans of the general staff and be prepared on many fronts. Every observer feels that the large-scale offensive began some time ago. As reported in the German war bulletin, the German encirclement of the British Isles is shrinking daily, which will have a final impact on Britain. In short, the German air force's offensive today, when Britain finally fails, will be admired by the general public. (Haitong, 29th)

Moscow: The Red Army's organ newspaper, "Zvezda," yesterday published an article on the success of the German and Italian naval and air forces in attacking England. The article stated that the current German attack aims to scout the weak points of England's coastal defenses, in order to gain air superiority in the English Channel and along the coast. Italy's attacks in the Mediterranean, Africa, and especially East Africa, have now been successful. Since the occupation of Kassala and Gallabat, the Italian military has secured its access to Sudan. Germany is now using its air force to blockade the British Isles. At the same time, Italy has cut off Britain's lines of communication in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean. Although Germany and Italy have not yet launched a major offensive against England, the two countries have already reaped the rewards of their cooperation. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Ankara: Turkish military expert General Ekilit wrote an article in the "Sembodas" newspaper yesterday, discussing Germany's chances of victory in invading England. General Ekilit believes that Germany is currently preparing a plan for military action. During this long period of waiting, it is also stimulating the people's nerves for the offensive. The military strength of Germany and Britain has had many opportunities for mutual probing. Judging from the two major battles in the Norway and Flanders regions, German military strength does have an advantage. The superiority of the German air force has now become an indisputable fact. Britain's maritime superiority has been balanced by the air force bases that Germany has established along the British coast. In fact, Britain's maritime superiority has long been unable to prevent German troops from being transported to Norway. The possibility of German troops landing on the British coast is now being admitted by British military experts as well. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

American Newspaper Observes Future of European Situation

New York: The European war is now approaching its final stage. Germany's intense air raids on England are sufficient to indicate that Germany has decided to implement its blitzkrieg tactics, so as to achieve a successful conclusion by the end of the summer. If Germany wins, Hitler will place all of Europe under his control. As for Italy, apart from being a vassal of Germany, it is difficult for us to believe that it will be able to increase its status and become equal to Germany. Because past history has shown us that two powers cannot coexist. No conqueror wants to have another force competing with them. At that time, Italy will undoubtedly be the temporary custodian of the Adriatic Sea, the western Balkans, the Mediterranean Sea, North Africa, and Northeast Africa, but its status will only be that of a custodian. At that time, the Soviet Union will also only control the Black Sea and the straits, making helpless Turkey a subordinate state. France has been conquered, Spain will certainly be in Germany's palm, and Portugal is also easy to take. Therefore, at that time, Hitler will politically and economically dominate the entire Old World. As for the United States, if Britain fails, it will become the last democratic country resisting totalitarian control of the world. At that time, Hitler may ally with Japan to contain the United States and seize America's Latin American markets. This action is much easier than launching an attack with actual force. The Havana Conference is the United States' effort to prevent this possible situation, but the result is still doubtful. (United Press, 29th)

### Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands Broadcasts Speech: Fighting for Freedom

London: The British Broadcasting Corporation will broadcast a Dutch program once a day from now on. Today, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands began with her first broadcast. The lady addressed the audience in Dutch, saying, "It has become increasingly clear that this war has become a struggle between good and evil. One side is fighting for God and our conscience, and the other side is the rising force of darkness. All who wish to operate everything in the world for the happiness of mankind and wish that their work is not destroyed by evildoers, their freedom is now in danger, just as it was in the early days of the war. Military flames, poverty, and pain cannot eliminate our true love of freedom, nor can they eliminate freedom of conscience and religion. Therefore, I firmly believe that we, and all those who think alike, will eventually transcend this holy suffering and ordeal. Our beloved flag is still proudly flying on the eastern and western seas of Greater Holland. Our warriors are still fighting alongside the Allies. The overseas empire deeply sympathizes with the disasters suffered by the motherland. In their thoughts and emotions, they are still closely united with us, and even more so than before. We intend to uphold the independence of all our regions with unwavering unity, and will not cease fighting until the bright prospects of freedom and happiness have dawned." (Reuters, 29th)

Seven amendments were proposed during the debate, all by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Most of them pointed out that the proposal represented a policy of surrendering to British imperialism. Four of these amendments were withdrawn without being put to a vote, and the remaining three were rejected by a majority vote. (Reuters, 29th)

Some expect that Konoe's all-embracing power will cause discontent among young military officers, but it is widely believed that Japan will eventually accept this new administrative structure, because in the eyes of the public, this is the only main way to promote Japan's domestic and foreign policies. It is believed that the government's new policies will be announced tomorrow. The cabinet secretary general announced last week that the Navy and Army General Staff had put forward a plan to "resolve the situation arising from the rapid changes in the world." It is said that the new cabinet and the Navy and Army have reached "absolute agreement." (United Press, 29th)

Tokyo: According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Konoe cabinet will abandon the British and American routes in diplomacy. After the supply of oil and iron from the United States is cut off, resolving this issue is of decisive importance to Japan. It is hoped that various measures will be agreed upon around August 1.

### American Republican Party Studies Far East Situation, Criticizes Roosevelt's Policies

Washington: Leaders of the American Republican Party have recently conducted a careful study of the situation in the Far East, in order to set a clear foreign policy as a tool for future presidential campaigns. Crawford, a Republican Congressman from Michigan and a frequent commentator on Far East issues, recently accused President Roosevelt of intending to have the United States join the Far East war only when circumstances require it. Crawford said that although President Roosevelt reluctantly guaranteed that he would not send troops to Europe, he has never definitively decided not to have his naval and air forces participate in the Far East war. Roosevelt had stated that there was nothing to make us feel that we were unnecessarily interfering in the Far East to protect the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and that the Republicans' enemies have said that there is no sufficient reason to oppose America's active Far East policy. As for him (Crawford), he will oppose any Far East policy that would lead the United States into war. However, general observers say that the Republican leaders will decide whether to make Far East diplomacy a major national policy with extreme caution, because a part of American opinion, in view of Japan's leaning towards the German-Italian axis, mostly advocates taking direct action to deal with Japan.

### Hong Kong Refugee Women and Children Leave Philippines for Australia

Manila: A Dutch ship weighing 16,000 tons, loaded with 484 Hong Kong refugee women and children, left here last night for Australia.

### Spain's American Oil Imports Issue

Stockholm: The Spanish Ambassador to Britain, the Duke of Alba, published an open letter in the Times, opposing the suggestion made by the British newspapers that the United States should stop transporting oil to Spain. The letter stated, "Your newspaper published a report from the New York Times on July 22 concerning Spain's gasoline imports." This is based on the propaganda of a certain British magazine. The amount of oil currently imported by Spain is only half of its normal needs, so the Spanish government has had to restrict the use of oil. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### Japanese Inspection of Mail in the French Concession - Chinese and Foreign Parties Closely Watching - Resolution Only Possible Upon Chapellier's Return to Shanghai - Independence and Integrity of Postal Administration Maintained

The Japanese side's attempt to inspect mail at the Route Massenet post office in the French Concession, with personnel sent daily to inspect the office premises and copy the names of mailbox renters, and to create maps of the branch postal district, seems to be becoming increasingly concrete. There are even widespread rumors that it will be implemented from August 1st. Details are recorded as follows:

Chinese and Foreign Residents Express Concerns

Within the French Concession, the Chinese population is extremely opposed to the issue of the Japanese side sending "mail inspectors" to examine mail. They all believe that residents of the French Concession have fulfilled their tax obligations to the French Municipal Council. The Japanese side's implementation of mail inspection within the French Concession is tantamount to hindering the freedom of correspondence for residents. Therefore, everyone sincerely hopes that the French authorities will immediately reject it and protect the rights and interests that residents should enjoy. Furthermore, foreign residents within the French Concession, such as residents of Britain, the United States, and other countries, have also unanimously expressed their opposition, because the inspection of mail certainly not only harms the rights and interests of the Chinese. Currently, diplomatic authorities of various countries, such as Britain and the United States, are also paying close attention to the development of this event.

French Consul-General Declines to Comment

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported, "It is learned that the Japanese authorities in this city are expected to begin inspecting mail in the French Concession this week. This morning (29th), a reporter asked the French Consul-General in Shanghai, Oltramare, about this matter, but he refused to say a word. However, it is widely believed that Postmaster Chapellier will approve Japanese inspectors to enter the French Concession after he returns to Shanghai from Kunming on Wednesday."

Postal Independence Not Undermined

A reporter from the "Ta Chung News Agency" visited Mr. Wang Weisheng, Deputy Director and Acting Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, yesterday afternoon to inquire about the process and truth of the French Concession mail inspection incident. Mr. Wang avoided all political viewpoints regarding this matter and gave a detailed interview to the reporter. According to him, the Japanese inspection of mail began at the General Post Office a year ago. This is a politically unavoidable move. However, although mail is being inspected, the independence and integrity of postal administration have not been subject to any restrictions or damage. The postal service is an international institution, and the strictness of the postal system is sufficient to guarantee that postal administration avoids being drawn into the whirlpool of politics. This should be understood by members of society. Since the General Post Office began mail inspection, if inspectors believe that a certain item of mail needs to be detained, if the detained item is an express letter or registered letter, the inspector must issue a receipt to the post office, and the post office must also notify the recipient in writing that the mailed item has been detained to fulfill its duty. If ordinary mail is detained, the post office must also register it, but as a rule, the recipient is not notified.

Chapellier Expected to Return to Shanghai

Mr. Wang also stated that the Japanese side did indeed have several contacts with the post office regarding the inspection of mail in the French Concession beforehand. However, he had not heard of the saying that it would be implemented on August 1st. There are a total of five branch offices in the French Concession: Route Massenet, Xujiahui, Route Conty, and Rue du Sacré-Cœur, four of which are "delivery branch offices." Route Massenet has a wider scope because it previously made a "combined delivery" with Route Cardinal Foch. There are about a hundred letter carriers. All local mail delivered within the area of "delivery branch offices" does not need to be transferred through the General Post Office and can be delivered directly. As for the installation of mailboxes, in addition to the General Post Office, the two branch offices on Route Massenet and Heng Road are specially permitted to install them. Recently, the Yuyuan Road branch office will also install mailboxes. Director Chapellier was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but due to encountering a typhoon in Hong Kong, the "Yusheng" ship he was on only left Hong Kong yesterday. Therefore, he is scheduled to arrive on August 1st. After Chapellier arrives in Shanghai, there will be a decision on the Liu mail inspection matter.

Hope to Avoid Political Narratives

Mr. Wang finally told the reporter with a sincere attitude that if the French Concession inspection is implemented, he sincerely hopes that members of society will avoid all political narratives or discussions when writing letters, so that all unnecessary losses can be avoided. Because Shanghai is a complex international city, it should adopt all prudent attitudes to remove all unnecessary troubles for itself. According to another source, the French Concession authorities are also closely monitoring this matter and discussing countermeasures.

Japanese Personnel Again Went for Preparations Yesterday

Since four Japanese personnel went to the Route Massenet post office for inspection last Saturday, at about 1:00 p.m. yesterday, the four Japanese personnel went to the branch again to copy all the charts and documents of the office, and inspected the procedures for mail management. Although they temporarily worked at a long table outdoors yesterday, the formal office location seems to be under preparation. The four Japanese personnel did not leave until 5:00 p.m. According to the person in charge of the branch, the matter of inspecting mail has now reached the point where it is only waiting for instructions from the General Post Office. The arrangement of the office and the various procedural issues of inspecting mail will be handled quickly once instructions from the General Post Office arrive. According to reliable sources, although the four Japanese personnel did not state their purpose when inspecting the branch, it is believed that they are carrying out preparatory work so that they can be proficient in all procedures when officially inspecting mail in the future. Although the date for starting mail inspection has not been determined, judging from the fact that the Japanese personnel have already gone to the branch to work, the date of implementation seems to be near.

### Criminal Court President Qian Hongye of the Special No. 1 Court Assassinated Yesterday - Assailants Followed Him from the Court to His Residence at Noon - Three Shots, All in Vital Spots, Result in Death

At around 12:00 noon yesterday, an assassination suddenly occurred at the back gate of the Yin Du Ice Skating Rink on Route Ghisi and Route Cardinal Foch. The victim was Qian Hongye, Criminal Court President of the Special No. 1 Court of the Public Concession. He was shot three times in the chest and abdomen on the spot, all in vital spots. He died at 4:15 p.m. The two assailants who opened fire escaped without a trace on bicycles. Details are learned as follows:

Taking a Chartered Car to Court Every Day

Qian Hongye, a native of Hangzhou, is currently 50 years old and resides at No. 43, Model Village on Route Cardinal Foch. He is well-known in the judicial circles. He is the current Criminal Court President of the Special No. 1 Court of the Public Concession, a position he has held for many years. He is known for his wisdom, integrity, and good reputation. He usually travels in a chartered car with license plate number 11, and employs Liu Ada, a native of Nantong, as his chauffeur. This has been the case for six years. Every morning around 8:00 a.m., Qian takes the chartered car to the temporary office of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court in the Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School on Weihaiwei Road to work. If there is a criminal trial, he then switches to a car to the Criminal Court of the First Court on Zhejiang Road to hear the case. Yesterday morning, Qian followed the usual routine to work at the temporary office on Weihaiwei Road. He finished his official duties at around 12:00 noon.

Assailants Intercepted and Shot

He planned to return to his residence for lunch and took the chartered car again. When the chauffeur Liu Ada pulled the car westward to the back gate of the Yin Du Ice Skating Rink at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Route Cardinal Foch, suddenly two assailants, both wearing Western-style suits on their upper bodies and shorts on their lower bodies, each riding a bicycle, chased from behind. The two cars overtook the chartered car, recognized Qian Hongye, and without asking any questions, pulled out handguns and fired four or five shots in a row. Qian was sitting upright in the car and could not avoid the attack. He was shot once in the chest and twice in the abdomen, and blood gushed out like a spring. He was barely breathing. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the assailants sped away westward on bicycles. When the patrolmen from the two concessions nearby heard the alarm and rushed over, the assailants were already long gone.

Severely Wounded and Died Tragically

They quickly summoned an ambulance to the scene and sent Qian to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. After the doctors performed surgery and carefully treated him, the wounds were in vital spots, and medicine was ineffective. He died in the hospital at around 4:15 p.m. The police authorities of the two concessions attached great importance to Qian's tragic shooting and death. They strictly ordered the detectives to investigate and arrest the perpetrators within a limited time. At the same time, the chauffeur and the chartered car were taken to the French Concession police station. The chauffeur was strictly interrogated about the circumstances of his master's death. A large number of detectives were then sent to the scene of the incident to investigate and collected empty bullet casings, which were taken back to the police station for research.

Sons and Daughters Rushed to See Him, Overwhelmed with Grief

Qian was wearing a white Indian silk long gown, with silk shirt and pants inside, a straw hat, and black straight-gong cloth shoes. It is reported that his wife, Xu, passed away three years ago. He only has one son named Silang, 33 years old, who is a professor at the Southwest Associated University in Kunming. He is married to Zhang and has two sons. Due to the summer vacation, Silang brought his family back to Shanghai to visit his relatives. Unexpectedly, less than ten days after arriving in Shanghai, a major accident occurred. After the case occurred yesterday afternoon, Silang and his wife rushed to the hospital to visit him, shedding tears and extremely grief-stricken. It is also learned that Qian had received threatening letters, and the concession police authorities had sent two plainclothes detectives to protect him, but he declined. The French Concession police station also sent several armed police officers to stand guard around his residence in Model Village, but Qian also politely declined.

News Spread, All Circles Mourned

Qian Hongye graduated from the Beijing National Law School in the first year of the Republic of China. He was deeply knowledgeable in law. He served as a judge in the Dali Yuan of the Ministry of Justice in Beijing for many years and achieved remarkable political achievements. In April of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, he was transferred to Shanghai Public Concession (when the court was reorganized) as the Prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court. In May of one year, he became the Criminal Court President of the court and has held this position for more than ten years. After the news of Qian's death spread, all circles in the city were shocked and mourned, and his colleagues in the judicial circles were particularly saddened.

### Users of Shanghai Electric Construction Company Eagerly Hope for Swift Resolution of Labor Dispute - All Employees State Reasons for Strike

The Shanghai Chinese directors of the Shanghai Electric Construction Company's worker slowdown, including Yu Qiaqing, are very concerned but have not yet formally mediated. According to a New Voice News Agency reporter, Mr. Yu has not yet met with the company's chairman, Kadoorie, but may visit him in the coming days to mediate. Workers issued a statement yesterday outlining the reasons for the slowdown and criticizing the failure to treat Chinese employees the same as foreign employees. All parties hope that the labor dispute can be resolved quickly, especially the company's users.

Workers Appeal

The statement issued by all Chinese employees regarding the slowdown reads as follows: "Our company's employees previously experienced a slowdown three months ago. Unexpectedly, less than three months later, the employer used a pretext to dismiss Yang Hanzhang, the former representative of the workers. Thereupon, the remaining workers, seeing this situation, felt that the company had suddenly gone back on its agreement, and everyone felt insecure. All workers in the old factory to which Mr. Yang belonged demanded on the 18th of this month that the company immediately reinstate Mr. Yang to fulfill its promise, and attached several conditions necessary for daily life. Unexpectedly, the employer did not consider it at all. The workers had no choice but to suspend work. During this period, Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Mediation Division of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department came to mediate, but the employer refused to negotiate and instead spent a large sum of money to hire a large number of White Russians to work in the factory, ignoring the employees and on the 24th, the employer again convened employee representatives and ordered them to resume work, otherwise they would be treated as resigned. The cruelty of this method is rare in Shanghai.

Unequal Profit Sharing

According to the company's prosperous business last year, it can be said that the company had never seen such prosperity since its opening. Last year's profits were as high as one million several hundred thousand yuan. Western employees can receive subsidies of 100% and 80%, while Chinese employees receive very little. It is very painful to say. The most is only 40%, and it must be limited to those with salaries below 50 yuan. Others are only 35% or 30%. Comparing the two, there is a world of difference. To prevent rumors from being untrue and distorting the truth, we hereby inform all circles of the circumstances of this slowdown, and hope for sympathy and assistance.

Final Conditions

Workers in the old and new factories held a meeting the night before last (Sunday) to discuss how to deal with the situation. They decided to revise the five preconditions previously presented to the employer and unanimously decided that this was the last step. The conditions are as follows: (1) Dismiss the White Russian workers. (2) Reinstate the dismissed worker Yang Hanzhang. No workers should be dismissed without reason. If the factory intends to lay off workers, severance pay should be paid for six months of the last wage, and savings should be calculated at 5%. (3) Wages should be paid as usual during the strike period. (4) Wages should be increased by 12 yuan across the board, wages should be increased by 10% each year, and a one-month bonus should be given annually. Restore half of the 1936 wage. (5) Rice subsidies. If the price of rice is above 20 yuan, the factory should subsidize 60 cents per yuan. Commodity subsidies remain the same. (Attachment) All unexpected conditions cannot be changed according to the previous (April) conditions. The above conditions were submitted in writing to Yu Qiaqing and Xi Yushu by the labor side yesterday morning, asking them to pass them on to the employer. It is said that the employer insisted on (1) deducting wages during the strike period and (2) dismissing one-third of the workers before agreeing to negotiate. According to rumors, the content of the labor dispute is becoming increasingly complex, and some people are trying to intervene. Fortunately, the workers' attitude remains unchanged and reconciliation is approaching.

### Group Rice Orders Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

The 2,300 bags of foreign rice ordered from Saigon by the "Special Food Commission" through the Banque de l'Indochine on the 13th of this month (the first batch after the "revised ordering method") arrived in Shanghai yesterday and are currently in the warehouse. The association has already sent letters to the commission's customers urging them to promptly take delivery of their orders. A second batch of orders is being actively pursued, with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and others each ordering several hundred bags. This batch is scheduled to be ordered from Saigon through the Banque de l'Indochine within days. The foreign rice ordered by the association is a total of one stone and two and a half dou per bag. Because of the lengthened foreign exchange rate and the expected large rice production in Saigon, the price is relatively cheap. Therefore, each bag of the foreign rice ordered in this project is four to five yuan less than the market price. Total rice delivered in the last three days amounted to over 50,000 bags.

The Shanghai Municipal Council has announced that it has appointed Sir Miles, Melly, and Bessley as the SMC representatives on the "Special Rice and Grain Commission." The special committee may hold a meeting in the "central district" this Thursday, and there are rumors that Japanese puppet "representatives" will be in attendance.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Approves - Shortening of Pawn Period

The case of pawnbroking businesses shortening the pawn period to twelve months has now been approved by a ministry order. The original telegram is as follows: "Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, fully understood the telegraphed report and attachments from May of the 29th year. The Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association is provisionally shortening the pawn period to twelve months in accordance with the case, and will restore the original pawn period when the market stabilizes. This should be approved for the record. In addition to notifying the Ministry of Finance, you must immediately notify and inform them." Ministry of Economic Affairs.

(3) Port exporters who receive a barter sheet from the interior importer must first apply to the local four banks and obtain a shipping certificate before shipment, attaching the invoice.

As for the Shaoxing rice relief one-yuan movement initiated by the business and academic communities, because Zhenhai is blockaded, it is difficult to transport relief rice, so it was resolved to stop the activity.

### Ningbo and Zhenhai Restore Prosperity - Japanese Warships Return to Bombard, Chinese Army Ignores - Japanese Izumo Ship Leaves Shanghai Yesterday, Destination Unknown

The Ningbo Association in Shanghai received a follow-up telegram from Zhenhai since its recovery: (1) At 8:07 a.m. the day before yesterday, a Japanese plane was spotted over Guanhaiwei. The plane then passed through Cixi, Fenghua, and Ninghai, and then went out to sea. (2) Three small Japanese warships anchored in the waters off Shita Mountain in the Huangda Yang area outside An Dong, Yuyao, released speedboats carrying troops. When the Japanese warships opened fire to provide cover, they attempted to land on Yingsheng Street in Yuyao, but were repelled by our garrison. (3) One Japanese warship was anchored in the waters off Longshan and Yanggang outside Zhenhai Port. The Japanese warship anchored at Ligang weighed anchor at 10:47 a.m. the day before yesterday and moved towards Zhenhai. When it sailed to the waters off Qiliji, it suddenly fired fifteen shots at Zhenhai without any purpose. Because of the distance, the bullets all landed on the beach and mud, so there were no losses. At 4:47 p.m., a Japanese warship anchored in the waters off Longshan sailed east to the sea outside Zhaobao Mountain and also suddenly fired more than ten shots at Zhenhai without any purpose. It then turned around and fled. The garrison responded calmly and did not return fire. The above two Japanese warships sailed to the waters off Longshan at 2:30 p.m. and anchored. Currently, except for this one Japanese warship, there are no other Japanese warships outside the port.

Local Situation

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, after the recovery of Zhenhai, administrative agencies have moved back into the city to work, the police have returned to their posts, and stores in Nanmen and the streets have also opened. Residents are returning one after another. However, most of the stores and houses in the Ximen area have been destroyed, presenting a scene of desolation. Numerous porridge factories have been established in the city to provide food for disaster victims. A large number of abandoned corpses were found in the war zones of Jiangnan Xiaogang, Qingzhiling, Jinjishan, and Jiangbei Zhaobaoshan. The Ningbo Burial Team has actively cleaned up and buried them, and the work has been completed. Floating corpses on the Daxie River and Xiaoxie River have also been salvaged and buried. Therefore, the fortress area has been restored to its original clean appearance, and the defenses have been rearranged to become more solid. Order in Ningbo has been restored more quickly. Shops have resumed business during the day. All pawnshops have returned to the city and opened. Banks have moved to Sheng County, so the return to work is slower, but it can be completed today and business can resume as usual.

Izumo Leaves Shanghai

The English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that the flagship Izumo of the Japanese fleet stationed in China was not seen at the Japanese Mail Steamship Company wharf on Huangpu Road today (29th). It is widely believed that the ship sailed to a certain point on the Zhejiang coast where military action is taking place. A Japanese naval spokesman said that due to military reasons, he could not disclose the exact destination of the Izumo, but according to another Japanese source, the Izumo may be sailing to various ports along the Yangtze River as usual. There is no clear news whether the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, Shimada Shigetaro Nakamura, is on the Izumo, but it is known that he is traveling with the flagship.

### British War Film Banned from Screening in French Concession - Allegedly Because It Has Not Been Approved - May Be Shown Privately After Review

The North-China Daily News reports that the Catholic Church at 135 Avenue Dubail, French Concession, was scheduled to show a British official war film last night (28th), but was suddenly banned by the French Concession police before the screening was about to begin. The film is a newsreel shot by Paramount Pictures on the European battlefield, such as the Battle of Narvik, the Retreat from Dunkirk, and British air defense. It has not been inspected and is not being shown publicly in Shanghai. The reason is obvious, but it has been lent to various associations for showing to their members and invited guests. The film was scheduled to be shown privately at the Catholic Church at 9:15 p.m. last night. About 400 viewers were present, and the hall was packed. Five minutes after the scheduled start time, the church's chairman, Pastor MacGregor, suddenly announced that the French police had banned the screening on the grounds that the film had not been inspected by the French authorities. The audience, upon hearing the news, not only did not show any signs of opposition, but also expressed sympathy and quietly dispersed. Pastor MacGregor told reporters last night that the French police had sent personnel to the meeting and instructed him to stop the screening because the film had not been approved by the French inspector. A spokesman for the French police also said that the film's screening in the French Concession was only delayed, not completely banned. Once it has passed the inspection, it will be allowed to be screened non-publicly in the French Concession. The British authorities have not yet made any comments on this matter. It is understood that the Archbishop's Church's screening of the film last night was purely non-public, only for members to watch, and no admission fee was charged. Ordinary members of the public were not allowed to enter. It is reported that there were some Italian nationals among the audience, and the Counselor of the Italian Consulate was also present. The English Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury also reported that an official from the French Concession Police Force recently told reporters that the Catholic Church originally scheduled to show a European war film last night. Because there were forty or fifty nationals of a belligerent country among the audience, Pastor MacGregor, fearing that there would be disturbances, reported it to the French Police Force. An officer arrived at the scene fifteen minutes before the film was shown. Pastor MacGregor explained to him, and on the advice of the officer, announced that the film's screening would be postponed.

### Restrictions on American Sailors' Night Out Newly Set - Shortened to Midnight

The Shanghai Times reported yesterday (28th) that the liberty of American sailors stationed in Shanghai has been temporarily shortened to midnight. According to the new order issued by the American authorities, personnel of American ships stationed in Shanghai are not allowed to enter entertainment venues after midnight and must return to their warships or barracks before midnight. However, those who have residences in Shanghai and have obtained special permission are allowed to stay ashore past midnight. This order took effect at midnight yesterday. As for the liberty of American Marines, it is also currently limited to midnight. In peacetime, the liberty of American Marines and Navy personnel is generally wider than it is now. It is widely believed that the restrictions currently imposed by the American authorities may be related to recent unexpected events.

### Autumn Tide Volume in Huangpu River

They picked it up to examine it, but unexpectedly, the bomb exploded with a loud noise, blowing off all the fingers of William Hansen's right hand. His body was also seriously injured. He was immediately sent to the Country Hospital for treatment and was hospitalized due to the severity of his injuries.

The Hong Kong government authorities, based on Articles 5 and 10 of the 1940 Defence Ordinance and with the approval of the Acting Governor, have now announced through the Commissioner of Commerce and Industry a ban on the transport and export of tea from Hong Kong. This restriction does not apply to those with permits approved and issued by the Commissioner. It is noted that Chinese tea, after the war, has been concentrated in Hong Kong for re-export, mostly to the Americas and the Soviet Union. It has been managed and sold by the Fuhua Company. This spring, to expand its business, it was merged into the China Tea Company for exclusive operation, leading to a surge in overseas sales. Currently, around 10,000 cases of Chinese tea are stored in Hong Kong. Now that exports are controlled, the overseas market for Chinese tea is bound to suffer some impact.

### Fraudulent Acts Used as Basis; Appeal Rejected; Chen Ren Remains with Original Sentence

At the end of last lunar year, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank had complex accounts. Someone transferred a check from a certain customer and forged a signature to fraudulently obtain 17,000 National Currency dollars. The bank discovered this and found that Chen Renhao, a staff member from Ningbo working in the seal department, was highly suspected. The bank reported this to the Central Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng to arrest Chen for investigation. Mei Kan, an expert appraiser from the Public Works Department, conducted a detailed examination of the signature on the check and related documents. The handwriting matched Chen's completely. Chen was then handed over to the First Special District Court, which filed a public prosecution for forgery. The Zhejiang Industrial Bank also hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil suit, requesting that the defendant be ordered to compensate 17,000 National Currency dollars. Chief Judge Qian Hongye conducted multiple hearings, but the defendant vehemently denied the charges, criticized the inaccuracy of the Public Works Department's handwriting analysis, and requested a re-examination. Judge Qian then ordered the defendant to post 8,000 dollars in cash for bail and commissioned a local calligrapher to conduct a re-examination, which also confirmed that the handwriting matched. At the conclusion of the trial, the verdict was announced. The main point of the verdict was that Chen Ren was found guilty of forgery and fraudulently obtaining property and was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, with a three-year reprieve, and ordered to compensate the Zhejiang Industrial Bank 17,000 National Currency dollars. Because the defendant was dissatisfied with the verdict, he appealed to the First Branch of the High Court. The case was adjudicated yesterday, and the appeal was rejected.

### British Children in China Evacuated from England to Shanghai; Arrive on the Empress of Russia Yesterday; Relatives Reunite After Long Separation, Overjoyed and Saddened

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the British government is actively evacuating children from certain areas of England for their safety. Some British expatriates residing in Shanghai and China, unwilling for their children in England to take refuge in Canada or the United States without parental care, entrusted a travel agency to arrange for their children to gather in Liverpool and depart by ship to Montreal, Canada. They then took a train to Vancouver and boarded the "Empress of Russia" to Shanghai, arriving at the port at approximately 10:20 AM this morning (the 29th). Their parents and relatives were already waiting at the customs dock. Reunion after a long separation brought both joy and sorrow. The ages of these British children ranged from six to sixteen. When they set off from Liverpool, there were originally forty-two people. During the journey, more than ten of them remained in Canada. As a result, only about thirty people arrived in Shanghai this morning. They will continue their education in Shanghai or other Chinese ports. According to several children, they received excellent treatment along the way. When crossing the Atlantic Ocean from England to Canada, the route was dangerous, and lights were controlled to avoid accidents. However, when crossing the Pacific Ocean to China, the journey was smooth.

### Grain, Another 50,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive, Rice Prices Fluctuate by Two or Three Yuan

At the market opening yesterday morning, spot foreign rice saw a more drastic drop. Buyers were watching quietly and did not make any purchases. Vendors and speculators were trying to sell off their holdings, and prices plummeted, but buyers turned a deaf ear. No transactions were made until the middle of the market, with Fire Jiao priced at only 47-48 yuan and Number 2 Jian at 44-45 yuan. Then, local shops took advantage of the low prices to buy, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions, causing the situation to reverse and tighten. Prices for various goods were easy to fall and easy to rise, and suddenly rebounded by about two yuan. By the close, Number 1 Chen Saigon had reached 51 yuan, new rice 50 yuan, Number 2 Chen Jian 47.5 yuan and 47 yuan, new rice 46 yuan, and Fire Jiao Jian 50 yuan.

The price of foreign rice rose and fell sharply yesterday, with a difference of three to four yuan. In the early morning, continuing the weak trend of the previous day, the prices of all kinds of spot rice fell, with spot rice falling by as much as two yuan. Later, because the owners were unwilling to sell at low prices, and local buyers were eager to buy for actual sales and new hoarding, the prices immediately returned to their original levels. At the afternoon close, there was even talk of raising prices. Because most of the road cargo original bags have arrived, due to monetary relations, the drop in the early market was extremely fierce. The opening price for spot original bags of Number 2 Siam rice reached 54.5 yuan, and newly arrived rice was quoted lower at 54 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan and 2.5 yuan compared to last Saturday. The opening price for original bags of newly arrived or soon-to-arrive rice to be re-exported also reached 55 yuan, a decrease of 1.5 yuan compared to last Saturday. As prices fell, large firms were unwilling to continue to lose money, and those who had made profits and new speculators took the opportunity to buy, and the market atmosphere changed. Prices gradually rebounded amid buying. Imports were quoted as high as 47 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan compared to last Saturday, and re-exports were quoted as high as 48 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan, both rebounding by three yuan from the low prices in the morning. However, buyers were not real consumers, and the outlook for the market is not optimistic.

Another large batch of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Zha Hua Company's Zhi Bi Sha ship, which went to Saigon to load rice, returned to Shanghai around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday (Saturday), carrying 4,000 tons of foreign rice, totaling more than 41,000 bags. It docked at the Puxi Blue Funnel Wharf and began unloading yesterday. Also yesterday, the Jardine Matheson Company's Yong Sheng ship arrived, carrying 9,340 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is reported that there are more large batches coming later. (Zu)

Although the supply of Japonica and glutinous domestic rice is still limited, when foreign rice prices plummeted, it was rumored that outside the market, the owners had no intention of defending prices and were focused on selling quickly. Buyers knew that the trend was irreversible and adopted a "get through it" mentality, causing prices to fall by as much as four or five yuan. Later, following foreign rice, prices rebounded slightly, but selling prices had already fallen significantly. Chang Bang Xian Special Japonica was only 63-64 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou White Japonica was around 60 yuan, next grade to Su Kun was 55-56 yuan, Qing Si Bo Dao was 61-62 yuan, Nan Gang Hu Zao was 55-56 yuan, Liyang glutinous rice was 58 yuan, Changzhou glutinous rice was 56-57 yuan, and Hong Kong glutinous rice was 56-54 yuan.

### Flour Prices Drop Another 50 Cents

Flour: Yesterday, the price of Number 2 flour from the Japanese flour mill was changed from 15.5 yuan to 15 yuan, a decrease of another 50 cents. Because retail sales on the Japanese street have been sluggish recently, and sales to customers have been quiet. Furthermore, the price of rice has fallen sharply, and everyone is bearish on the market. Japanese mills, benefiting from low wheat prices, have already depreciated their prices. Chinese mills have been heavily squeezed, and now they have no choice but to lower their prices as well. The total number of bags directly sold by various factories, such as Fu Fu, in the market has increased to over 5,000. Because Japanese flour and domestic flour have already been depreciated repeatedly, wood customers still want to push prices down further, while sellers are adamant about selling, creating a standoff between buyers and sellers. It is reported that Feng Feng flour is only selling for 13.6-13.7 yuan, but there have been no formal transactions.

Wheat: Yesterday's trade in new wheat was still quiet. The supply from Hongkou is increasing daily. It is rumored that domestically stored wheat will also be transported to Shanghai in large quantities, but this matter is still being worked on. Those holding goods are under pressure from the environment and are forced to sell at a loss. It is reported that Chinese mills can receive 2,000-3,000 bags per day, at a price of around 20 yuan. Japanese mills are buying at less than 18 yuan, a difference of more than 2 yuan.

### Finance, Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand is Sufficient to Offset

The foreign exchange market was stable yesterday. HSBC's listed prices did not change. The black market for British and American exchange rates continued to tighten, due to the persistent speculation by Chinese banks and speculators. With a slight difference in supply and demand, prices softened slightly. The opening this morning was quite flat. Later, due to foreign firms settling accounts for foreign rice and strong demand from HSBC and Chinese banks, the US dollar reached 6.0625 yuan. At one point, the forward September US dollar rate fell below 6 yuan, to 5.96875 yuan. The market was extremely stagnant, with few discussions or transactions. Therefore, the closing price was the same as the afternoon price: 3 875/10,000 of a British gold pound and 6.0625 yuan for the US dollar. The futures market was also the same.

Foreign rice still has to be settled

Early in the morning, the exchange rate was stable, with no change in the British rate against the US dollar, and stable for Shanghai. The US dollar fell two points against the British pound and was stable for Shanghai; there was no market for the French currency. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices by banks were 3 890625/10,000 of a British gold pound and 6.09375 yuan for the US dollar, both flat compared to last Saturday's close. After the opening, the market was calm. Foreign firms and Chinese businesses first offered HSBC the US dollar for this month at 6.09375 yuan. Subsequently, Chinese banks also bought the US dollar for this month from foreign firms at 6.09375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also unchanged. Afterwards, foreign firms suddenly had needs, and foreign rice settlements were made to American banks, softening the US dollar to 6.0625 yuan. At the same time, Chinese banks and HSBC absorbed the US dollar from American banks for the same month at 6.0625 yuan, and Chinese speculators also purchased the US dollar for the distant month. HSBC and others sold the speculators the September US dollar for 5.96875 yuan. By noon, buying and selling were still balanced, with no changes. As a result, the British gold pound was 3 875/10,000, and the US dollar was 6.0625 yuan, with the British pound tighter by 0.015625 and the US dollar narrower by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening. The futures market was soft.

Sparse Transactions in the Afternoon

The market remained stagnant throughout the afternoon, with few transactions. The spot and futures prices for both the British and American currencies were the same as the afternoon closing prices: 3 875/10,000 of a British gold pound and 6.0625 yuan for the US dollar. The August British gold pound was 3 859375/10,000 and the US dollar was 6.00 yuan. Compared to the closing prices of last week, the US dollar spot and futures prices were tighter by 0.03125, while the British gold pound was softer by 0.015625.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Quiet

Hong Kong, 29th (Monday) wire: The exchange market opened quietly this morning. The spot prices for British, Japanese and Shanghai currencies remained unchanged.

### Amid Scattered Buying, the Gold Market Advances to a Peak

Yesterday's black market for cash (烚赤) continued the firm trend of the previous weekend, hovering around 5,400 yuan. Because new buyers were quite enthusiastic, those selling at high prices were mostly those without the strength to hold on. Therefore, prices looked like they would rise to a new peak. The market opened 23 yuan higher, at 5,355 yuan. At the opening, silver firms immediately came in to buy, rising to a high price of 5,420 yuan. Although gold firms and money changers offered to sell in between, slightly lowering prices, silver firms continued to buy without reservation. The afternoon close was still at 5,382 yuan. The market was slightly quieter in the afternoon, but prices were extremely stable. The highest price after the opening was 5,392 yuan, but it was lowered by money changers who released their holdings, falling to 5,378 yuan. However, the close was at 5,383 yuan, an increase of 51 yuan compared to last Saturday. Trading was still active throughout the day, with approximately 3,000 taels traded. The price of gold ornaments at silver shops remained unchanged, and the price of customs gold remained the same.

Cash (烚赤) Up 50 Yuan

Starting in the morning, the price per tael (ten taels) initially had good sentiment due to reports that the Ministry of Finance would issue new bonds, rising by 23 yuan. Gold firms first sold 10 taels to silver firms at 5,355 yuan. Afterwards, as the exchange market weakened, the buying sentiment became even stronger, and silver firms and gold firms rushed to buy, soon rising another 65 yuan. Silver shops sold tens of taels to silver firms at 5,420 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange market rebounded, and scattered buyers sold at the high price, and a certain money changer also sold off, soon falling 50 yuan. Silver firms sold 50 taels to money changers, falling to 5,370 yuan. Afterwards, as the foreign exchange market tightened again, buying sentiment rose again, and securities firms and silver firms bought one after another, rising back to 5,395 yuan. Before the close, the price fell again by 13 yuan due to floating buyers selling and a decrease in buyers. Gold firms made 20 taels with each other, closing at 5,382 yuan. The afternoon opening was slightly higher, with money changers buying 10 taels from gold firms at 5,390 yuan. It then rose another 2 yuan, with silver firms buying 30 taels from gold firms at 5,392 yuan. Subsequently, money changers suddenly sold strongly, slightly pushing prices down. Gold firms sold 30 taels to silver firms at 5,378 yuan. Afterwards, silver firms bought again, raising the price by 5 yuan. Securities firms bought 20 taels from silver firms at 5,383 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, the price increased by 51 yuan compared to the previous day. There was strong demand after the close, and the price was raised to 5,390 yuan, with no sellers. There was a fluctuation of 65 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold from cash gold firms was more than ten yuan higher than 烚赤, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no sign of it opening.

Ornamental Gold Rose and Then Fell Back

The selling price of gold ornaments at silver shops initially remained at 550 yuan per tael at Da Tong Heng. At 10:00 AM, it rose by 10 yuan, and at 11:00 AM, it fell back by 10 yuan. After that, there were no changes. Da Tong Heng still offered 550 yuan. The prices at Xin Tong Heng were similar to the above, with the buying price reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Continue to Rise

In yesterday's foreign currency market, in addition to cash 烚赤 rising by 50 yuan, the British and American gold pounds each rose by one yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes was balanced, and the market price was stable. The price of American gold notes rose due to the tightening of the black market US dollar exchange rate, reaching a high of 16.56 yuan, before settling at 16.45 yuan, an increase of 5 cents compared to last Saturday. There was a slight demand for Hong Kong notes, and the market price rose slightly. There was also a need for Singapore, Annam, Robbie, and Canadian notes, and the market prices rose uniformly. There was also a strong demand for Japanese gold notes, reaching a high of 1.232 yuan in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes was balanced, and the market price was stable, remaining at 1.08 yuan in the evening market.

### Financial Review, Continued from Yesterday

— Sheng Kaihuan

Until July 27th

According to the statistics for the first half of 1940, the total export value was 101.8 million yuan, of which exports to the Japanese yen bloc accounted for 60%. The total import value was 185.6 million yuan, of which imports from third countries accounted for more than 70%. Therefore, the nominal trade surplus was 16.2 million Japanese yen, an increase of 13.6 million Japanese yen compared to the same period in 1939. In reality, trade with third countries showed a large surplus of 50.3 million Japanese yen, an increase of 76 million Japanese yen compared to 1939. This surplus must be paid in foreign exchange. The surplus of approximately 67 million Japanese yen with the Japanese yen bloc was obtained in Japanese yen, which could not be used to purchase foreign exchange for military raw materials. The analysis of Japan's trade situation in the past six months is as follows (numerical unit: thousands of Japanese yen):

### Discount Rate Falls Slightly by Two Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills and drafts showed a slight decline. In the morning, the discount rate per thousand yuan fell slightly to 47 yuan, and the lending rate also fell from a strong 50 yuan to 49 yuan. In the afternoon, it remained around 48 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to last Saturday. The interest rate of the Money Traders Association remained the same in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities, Type E Particularly Excited

The securities black market saw some changes yesterday. In general, prices still rose. Type E was particularly favored by various firms, and demand was extremely strong. The market price rose steadily in a straight line in the morning, with the closing price in the afternoon rising by a substantial one yuan. Type A, which has always been very firm, suddenly retreated to a cold position, with absolutely no rise or fall. Type C also only improved slightly by one cent. Type E, which has always been slightly lower than Type C by four or five cents, suddenly changed to Type C being five cents lower than Type E. Therefore, mutual swapping transactions were triggered in the afternoon, slightly narrowing the market prices. The market price of Type D was cheaper than any other type, so buyers were also very active. In the morning, Ren Chang bought very strongly. De Fu, Gong Mao, Jiu Feng, and Lian Yi also participated enthusiastically. On the selling side, Yi Tai was the most, and Hu He Ji, Hong Da, Run Li, and Tong Kang also sold. But very few Type E were offered, and due to the fierce covering of short positions, prices rose by as much as 9.5 cents. Type E was still being bought in the afternoon. Companies such as Gong Mao, Ren Chang, and Jiu Feng still had demand. Fortunately, Yong Xiang, Heng Fu, Lian He, and Number 38 all sold Type E, mostly exchanging for Type C. Number 64 sold Type A, and Hong Da and Hou Da sold Type C, while retail investors bought Type D. Market prices for Type C and E eased slightly, while the others were firm. Type D was particularly strong. Today is the last day including interest, and there may be a slight rebound. The results of the day's market were uniformly trending firmer, rising from 5 cents to 6.5 cents. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.3 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Fifty shares of Bank of China stock were traded, at a price of 64.5 yuan in legal tender, excluding interest.

Also, at the Public Industry Exchange Stock Market, the market opened very excited in the early morning, but the rising trend was slightly suppressed due to strong selling pressure. However, the strength of the market should not be limited to this. Even when the prices of various stocks fell back, there were still many buyers, indicating very good potential. The Shanghai Silver Company recently announced an interim dividend of 1 yuan, which was somewhat disappointing. Rubber stocks attracted relatively more attention.

### Yarn and Cotton, Single Yarn Sales Active in the South, Double Horse Near the 1,000 Yuan Mark

The yarn market is firm, and the rising trend has resumed. This is because the actual demand in South China is somewhat more active, with 32-count single yarn being the majority. Therefore, the sentiment is rising. However, general speculators have been quiet for a long time, and seeing that the environment has improved slightly, they are particularly active in pushing up prices. Everyone is absorbing a few bags, tightening the market. In fact, everyone has goods on hand and hopes that prices will rise. If the long positions loosen their hold after profiting, there is a deep fear of a severe reaction.

The opening price of spot yarn this morning continued the firm and high momentum of the previous day. There were many shouting high and raising prices. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 970 yuan. However, a large player with long positions sold off a portion, and prices fell back to 980 yuan, hovering between 82 and 83 yuan for a long time. But actual transactions by customers were not improving, and the market was stable. The closing price was 985 yuan. According to statistics, 2,235 bales were traded during the day. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 29 yuan. The amount purchased by each firm is listed below:

Domestic 30, Hong Kong 305, total 2,205
Xiamen 10

### Cotton Mill Purchases Still Lacking

Spot cotton transactions are slightly more active, but large transactions are still lacking. The cotton purchased by Japanese mills is paid for one month later. Although the sales of yarn are sluggish, prices rise with speculation buying which is somewhat active, but the cotton mills raw cotton still are purchasing very little. Therefore, the cotton market price is stable. The spot cotton sales situation is listed on the left:

Another message about foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was weak, due to a lack of major buyers and a good weather report from the cotton region, and some limit-down selling. As a result, domestic prices fell by four or five pounds. The Indian cotton market rose rapidly yesterday, with forecasts of an increase of more than one rupee.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market has been very quiet recently. Mill interest is also scarce. The improvement in yarn prices is indeed a good sign. Japanese manufacturers are silent, but fellow traders have some transactions, but the amount is very small.

### Piece Goods, Various Parties Take Advantage of Low Prices to Buy, Selling Prices Mostly Rise

Domestic Cloth: Sales continued to be good. As yarn prices rose continuously and sentiment turned bullish, various parties absorbed inventory at low prices, and the market atmosphere livened up slightly. Asking prices also increased. Coarse and fine cloths and twills rose by 10 cents to 50 cents per piece, and bleached and dyed cloths rose by 25 cents to 50 cents. Demand from wholesale numbers and dye factories on this street was particularly strong, with more than 1,500 pieces traded, mostly coarse cloth and dyed gray cloth. Cantonese and Hong Kong firms bought more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, and the Wen firm bought nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. Overseas, Singapore and Siam bought more than 3,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Prices rose first and then leveled off. As a result, medium-grade fine cloth and fine twill rose by 25 cents to 50 cents per piece. High-end Dragon Head fine cloth and new ship single rose to 30 yuan at one point, but the rising momentum was excessive, and the market price fell back to 29.35 yuan before closing. Four Gentlemen serge fell from 88 cents to 87.5 cents per yard, but the market sentiment was still firm, because sales on the wood street are very strong.

Exports: Two hundred pieces of piece goods were transported to Tianjin today.

### Oil Cake, Sales Still Good, Prices All Improve

Yesterday's oil cake market generally followed the improvement of the previous weekend, so the trend continued to rise uniformly. Although the oil market showed signs of softening at the close, there were few sellers. A total of 100 pieces of Jiaozhou new raw oil were traded. The price details are in the market price column: 300 pieces of road cargo, 100 pieces of Yantai new raw oil, 500 pieces of number brand new raw oil, 150 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 80 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 50 pieces of soybean oil, 20 units of Pudong bean oil, 50 dan of Dayou factory oil. With the potential for raw material soybeans to rise without falling, and the Fire Bureau having a favorable attitude, all parties are once again active, but the situation is not static, and transactions are not surging. Only a Xiamen firm bought 6,000 pieces of Dayou four brands at 11.95 yuan. Domestic customers inquired about 1,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cake at 10.65 yuan to 10.7 yuan, one truck of Fei Zi cake at 10.5 yuan, and 3,000 pieces of Qing Zhong cake at 9.3 yuan to 9.5 yuan.

Also, 300 cans of tung oil were transported from Tianjin yesterday, and 1,400 tons of coconut oil were transported from Saigon to Shanghai.

### Sugar Market, Foreign Sugar Rises and Falls Mixed

Yesterday's sugar market saw tight coarse white sugar, while che white sugar was slightly softer. The association's designated spot price for 24 coarse white was 66 yuan per home owned-warehouse, an increase of 7 cents from the previous day's closing price, and 66.2 yuan per foreign owned-warehouse to 66 yuan. Transshipment cargo rose slightly, with dockside delivery at 50.07 yuan to 50.6 yuan, and delivery on August 15th from 51 yuan to 51.2 yuan to 51.3 yuan. Taikoo che white was slightly softer, with B-mark at 72.5 yuan and H-mark che red at 55.5 yuan, up 3 cents. Dutch red was 60 yuan. This factory snow white was still 66.5 yuan, number one ice was 87 yuan, Jing Ming ice was 88.5 yuan, all down 5 cents. The domestic sugar market had a narrow sales range, resulting in a lack of continued price increases.

### Silk and Tea, Red and Green Tea Have Minor Sales

Yesterday's foreign firm tea market saw European sales of common fine eyebrow green tea remain stagnant. Only German and American firms had scattered sales of red tea and shrimp eye green tea from local firms. The entire market had a total purchase of more than 200 boxes of red and green tea by Jinlong Xingcheng and Maison. The selling price of red tea was 285 yuan, and the selling price of pearl tea was from 265 yuan to 290 yuan. Market prices were trending towards stability. In addition, an American firm's lines for Feng Mei have some potential to be active.

### Export of Raw Silk: Nearly 50,000 Piculs for the Entire Year

According to a figure from a silk industry source, from June 1st of last year to May 30th of this year, a full year's worth of Shanghai raw silk exports totaled 49,960 piculs. Among these, sales to the United States were the most numerous, accounting for approximately 60% of the total.

Since the start of the European war last September, the British and French trading companies in the Far East have drastically reduced their purchases, likely due to widespread unease abroad. As the European war escalated, British and French firms became even more disinterested, almost ceasing operations, causing export volumes to decline daily. Of the exports handled by the Daa Ching Trading Company, they accounted for 9,970 piculs, approximately 19.55% of the total.

The next highest exporter was Jardine Matheson, with 9,385 piculs, accounting for 18.79% of the total. Other trading companies exported a combined 858 piculs, representing only 1.72% of the total. Currently, some trading companies in Shanghai have changed their strategies, diverting factory silk previously bought in Shanghai to the American market. (Xiang)

### Metals: Large Sheets of Tinplate Hold Firm in Price

Large sheets of tinplate, which are in particularly short supply on the market, are not being shipped in from overseas, and future orders are not being fulfilled. Consequently, the small amount currently available is all that can meet demand. As a result, dealers holding stock are seeking to profit from scarcity, and prices have not fallen. Although demand from drum manufacturers, locksmiths, machine factories, and yarn mills in this area is sluggish, and there is no business from Hong Kong, Tianjin, and other regions, market sentiment remains optimistic. Transactions are mostly based on the number of sheets, with both purchase and sale prices calculated per sheet. Bulk sales by the crate are rarely heard of. For example, 24-gauge tinplate sells for 32 yuan per piece (26-gauge sells for around 16 yuan).

Debunking the Myth of Immortals

Immortals originate from Taoism, and Taoism transmits nothing but empty and elusive matters. Lao Tzu said, "My greatest affliction is having a body." If one is afflicted even by one's own body, how can one be willing to save the bodies of others, thus burdening oneself? Therefore, stories of true immortals saving the world are often found in unofficial histories; the foolish believe them, while the wise doubt them. As for using talismanic water to cure diseases, this is even more a deceptive art, not something that true practitioners of immortality would deign to do. This trend is most prevalent in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Wu-Yue region has always revered ghosts and spirits; burning incense, chanting Buddhist scriptures, worshiping the Dipper constellation, and seeking immortality are almost ubiquitous. Temples are everywhere, and incense smoke is constantly present. Using incense ash to treat illnesses, calling it "immortal elixir," is something that elderly women in rural areas believe in and revere. "Summoning souls," known as "summoning belly immortals" in Yue, involves asking a spirit medium to invite the deceased spirit of the inquirer's family for questioning. Ignorant people mistakenly believe this to be real and shed tears. In reality, the gurgling sounds are all fabricated. In Huzhou, there is a Cao Filial Son Temple, served by an old woman who tends to the incense. Suddenly, it was rumored that a living Buddha had descended, capable of curing people's illnesses with incense ash. People flocked there incessantly. The local officials, wanting to prohibit it, were constrained by the words of the local gentry. Later, fearing that it would mislead the public and cause trouble, they finally ordered the destruction and burning of the statue. The spirit then became silent, and no other harm occurred. Last year, in Ningbo, someone built a Land God shrine by a bridge to collect incense money. The local officials, upon hearing of it, demolished the shrine and confiscated the money, to the delight of those who heard of it.

### At the Beginning of Man, Nature is Not Good

— Editor

Some say human nature is inherently good, while others believe it is inherently evil. However, according to psychology, I believe it is more appropriate and closer to the truth to say that human nature is not good.

After a baby is born, it only knows itself and nothing else, taking itself as the center of the world. In reality, it is a selfish and self-serving little animal. Later, as it grows up, it gradually learns about its mother, father, nanny, siblings, relatives, and friends. Thus, it gradually develops from selfishness and self-interest into a habit of considering others, eventually evolving into an altruistic personality. Selfishness is the starting point of a person's character, while altruism is the highest peak of a person's character development.

The process of personality development varies for each individual. Some people do not progress at all after birth, remaining a selfish and self-serving little fellow forever. Some make some progress but do not fully develop to the point of altruism. Still others, with emotionally mature personalities, develop to the ultimate point of altruism.

Therefore, the development of a person's personality is, in fact, from self-interest to altruism. Selfishness is certainly not good, but it cannot be said to be "evil." It is more appropriate to say "not good."

Therefore, I say, "At the beginning of man, nature is not good."

Psychology

### The Dynamic and Static of Writing

— Chu

The style of writing has always been considered something that can only be understood intuitively, not conveyed in words. However, according to recent reports from psychologists, writing style can also be studied using scientific methods, and the results obtained are quite satisfactory.

Psychologists generally believe that style can be divided into two major categories: dynamic and static. Any writing that uses more verbs is considered to have a "dynamic" style. People who write this type of writing are definitely active, lively, and prone to emotional impulses. Conversely, any writing that uses more static words (nouns and adjectives) has a "static" style. People with this style are more quiet, thoughtful, and relatively mature.

This is just a general statement. How are "dynamic" and "static" styles distinguished? Dr. David Pablo Boder, Head of the Psychology Department at Lewis Institute of Technology in the United States, recently invented a method called "Adjective-Verb Quotient (A.V.Q.)". This method can be used to accurately represent whether a piece of writing is dynamic or static using numbers.

The so-called "dynamic-static quotient" is not difficult to measure. Just take a piece of writing and count its verbs and adjectives. The ratio of the number of adjectives to the number of verbs is the "dynamic-static quotient." For example, if the dynamic-static quotient of a piece of writing is 50, it means that for every 100 verbs used, 50 adjectives are used.

Dr. Boder used this method to study various types of writing and discovered many interesting facts:

Scripts use the fewest adjectives, with an average quotient of only 11. Legal documents are 20. Novels are 25. Scientific works are 75. The fewer adjectives, the easier it is to read, so scientists are really not considering the readers.

The average dynamic-static quotient of business letters is 19, while that of private letters written by people without literary training is 22. Poetry is in the middle, with an average quotient of 36. Advertising writers love to pile up words, with a dynamic-static quotient of 78; but they are still not as good as Ph.D.s. On average, a doctoral dissertation has the most adjectives, reaching as many as 88!

The dynamic-static quotient of writing is greater than that of speaking because more effort is spent on deliberation when writing.

The dynamic-static quotient is also affected by age, but Dr. Boder has not yet drawn any conclusions about the relationship. For example, the writer Emerson kept a diary for more than 50 years. According to Dr. Boder's research, he liked to use more adjectives when he was young than when he was old. The former was 59, while the latter was 37. The philosopher William James, when he was in his forties, used more adjectives in letters to women than in letters to men, but when he was in his sixties, the opposite was true - there were more adjectives in letters to men.

War

### Three Types of Columns

— Hua Zhi

Since the outbreak of the Second European War, many new terms have appeared in newspapers and publications. The most common of these is "Fifth Column," which refers to all kinds of internal traitors. With the outbreak of this European war, the Germans made extensive use of the "Fifth Column" to disrupt small countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway, occupying these countries with lightning speed. Even the French surrender can be attributed not to a lack of military strength, but to the activities of the "Fifth Column" in France, as British politicians have pointed out.

Since the "Fifth Column" has such terrifying destructive power, all neutral countries in the world could not help but feel uneasy and thought of using columns to resist columns. In addition, Germany had long harbored ambitions for South America and was particularly jealous of the United States' support for democratic countries. To prepare for any attacks, the United States created the "Sixth Column." The Sixth Column first appeared in Philadelphia, where Dr. Kagan, the local police and medical superintendent, first advocated gathering retired soldiers and firefighters to form special groups, calling them the "Sixth Column," dedicated to annihilating the "Fifth Column" and safeguarding national interests. These groups are supervised by retired officers from the army, navy, and air force and have military discipline. Once approved by the U.S. Department of the Army and Congress, the Sixth Column will be popularized throughout the country.

Similar to the U.S. "Sixth Column," the United Kingdom also has a group to prevent espionage, called the "Silence Column." Its job is also to guard against enemy propaganda activities, and it is organized by young, capable personnel. However, recently, because its scope of activities was not large, it was temporarily suspended and will be expanded into an active column.

### Without Descendants

— Qian Meizhang

"There are three unfilial acts, and the greatest is to have no descendants." I think everyone can understand that these two sentences mean that not having a son to continue the ancestral bloodline is unfilial. The Chinese people value the concept of succession, and it is commendable in terms of encouraging childbirth and strengthening the nation. However, merely increasing the population without planning for good education cannot compete with others in this era of survival of the fittest.

I believe that the explanation of the two words "without descendants" is not so simple. I once discussed it with a friend, whose views were more sophisticated. He said: Not educating children is called "without descendants." What is the point of "filial piety" or "having descendants" if one merely has children but cannot cultivate them to be useful talents? How few of them do not disgrace their ancestors?

Huo Sang Detective Case

### The Final Destination of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Four: Several Guesses

Huo Sang said, "I want to go and see my client, Jiang Anna, first to confirm the facts we know. Since you suspect Yu Gantang, you might as well go and see him first."

Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Okay, he is studying at Jiangnan University, I think it will be easy to find him."

"One more thing, you can check who was on duty here at night. Maybe we can get some information about the black car Lao Mao saw and the people who came in and out of here."

Ni Jinshou agreed, walked out of the guest room, talked with Li Zhifan upstairs for a while, and then returned to the reception room. Then Huo Sang locked the iron box and desk drawers and handed the keys to Ni Jinshou. When we walked out of the Wang family gate, I saw that police officer number ninety was still standing there. Huo Sang asked Ni Jinshou to remove the police officer, and also asked the police officer if a young man had uncovered the sheet covering the corpse when the body was carried out just now.

The police officer said, "Yes, there was indeed a guy in a suit standing in front of the car carrying the body just now. I thought he was an idler watching the excitement, so I didn't pay much attention. But I didn't see him uncover the sheet."

Huo Sang didn't ask any more questions, but whispered a few words to Ni Jinshou, and they agreed to notify each other if there were any developments. As we got into the car, Ni Jinshou and police officer number ninety-nine also got into the car and went to Datong Road.

After Huo Sang started the car at the steering wheel, he was very silent, as if he was concentrating. He was quite skilled at driving. He had experienced steep and winding mountain roads in the interior before, and he had never had any accidents. At this moment, he was driving on a flat and smooth road, and the traffic was not very crowded, so it seemed that he didn't need to be so nervous. I thought his thoughts were obviously still focused on this suspicious case. I opened the car window and inhaled some fresh air that had been filtered by the sun. Because I had stayed next to the tragic corpse for more than two hours, and added to the complicated and tangled case, my mind was also a little dizzy.

After a while, I asked, "Are we going to see Jiang Anna?" Huo Sang nodded, but didn't answer.

"Do you know her address?"

"Yes, she said it's number 306, Kangning Apartment." After he finished this simple answer, he was silent again.

I always felt a little impatient, and after a while, I couldn't help but ask, "What questions do you plan to confirm when you see Anna?"

Huo Sang still replied briefly, "There are many questions."

I still tried to coax him to talk more. "The exact relationship between the four men is definitely the main topic you want to investigate. Right?"

"Yes, but there are others."

"What? Give me an example." (Sixty)

### The Importance of Set Design in Costume Dramas

— Jun Mei

The Golden Star Company, which everyone has been anticipating, is said to have decided that its maiden work will be "Li Xiangjun," starring Shu Shi and Gu Lanjun. This, of course, is still a costume drama. But we are not disappointed because it is a costume drama. Under the condition of correct awareness, costume dramas are still worthy of our welcome.

In the past, costume dramas were mostly crudely made, which is undeniable! The so-called folk tale films, in a short period of five, six, or ten days, can actually produce a film that must undergo a long period of research and preparation. This is an innovation in the world of cinema, and perhaps there will be no successors? Therefore, the content and results can be imagined. Set design, which occupies an important position in costume dramas, is undoubtedly unspeakable!

Before Cecil B. DeMille prepared to make the historical film "Cleopatra," with his outstanding talent and rich experience, he seemed to be more than capable. However, how cautious was he? In terms of set design alone, he collected a large number of historical books in the research department of Paramount Pictures and other various libraries, and consulted more than 100 kinds of personal collections to study the various etiquette, customs, clothing, architecture, weapons, utensils, and jewelry of ancient Rome and Egypt. He believed that the importance of set design in a film is no less than that of every actor in the film, and costume dramas cannot ignore this point.

He said: "In the play, if you want to depict Caesar issuing an order or sending a letter, what kind of thing should you use to write the order and the letter? Also, if you want to show a maid needing to relax, can you use a piano? But at that time, paper and pianos had not yet been manufactured!" Therefore, in order to be realistic, no matter how small the scene or screen is, even just a hairpin, he has to consult and explore with historians, antique experts, painters, and screenwriters in detail. In this way, he spent more than eight months of detailed preparation, from 9:00 in the morning to 11:00 every night, to complete the script, actors, set design, and various arrangements before he dared to start filming.

Here, we can see the importance of set design in costume dramas. It is not only for decoration and beauty, but also can even determine the fate of the entire film. In fact, we certainly cannot be as serious as Cecil B. DeMille, but it is impossible to succeed if things are mismatched, making people feel uncomfortable, or if things are simplified and mistakes are simply carried on. Therefore, I ask the filmmakers to consider the above. At the same time, I also hope that other filmmakers who make costume dramas will be cautious in doing things.

### Golden Star Hosts Colleagues

After the establishment of Golden Star Film Company, it specially hosted colleagues, cinema operators, and film merchants from Nanyang and various domestic ports at the Red Cotton Restaurant the night before last. More than a hundred guests attended, and were cordially entertained by Wu Zhengjue, Feng Xizui, Zhou Jianyun, and others in charge of the company. At the banquet, Chairman Zeng Wanpu of Golden Star Company first expressed his welcome and gratitude. Then, manager Wu Zhengjue gave a speech, saying, "Golden Star is just starting out, and its human and material resources are very weak. It needs the support of colleagues and sages from all walks of life. The establishment of Golden Star is entirely for business purposes, and it hopes to make a small contribution to the film industry through this." On the night, film industry giants from Shanghai gathered together, which was a rare grand event in the film industry recently.

### How to Make Movies? (1)

— De Gang

The history of the production of movies is not very long, but because scientists continue to research and invent, movies are progressing day by day; silent films, sound films, color films, and even stereoscopic films that will soon be realized, all follow one after another. Movies have now become an important tool for mass entertainment. It can be said that many people still feel very vague about the principles of ordinary people's lives and the methods of shooting movies. The author is willing to give a brief overview of the general aspects of shooting movies, and contribute to readers who are interested in this issue.

(1) Cross-section of the Photography Studio: To make a film, the first thing you need is a very large photography studio, hundreds of meters long and wide, made of steel frames and glass. In this photography studio, you can use skills and scenery to create the scenes required in the film, such as living rooms, houses, or high mountains and seas. The floor of the photography studio is extremely strong, so that hundreds or even thousands of actors can stand on it, or groups of cattle and sheep, heavy vehicles, etc. can come and go without collapsing. Next to the photography studio, there are mostly rest rooms, dressing rooms, arrangement rooms, carpenter rooms, etc. for the actors, which also occupy a large area.

(2) Source of Light: Making a film is like taking a photo, requiring a lot of light. The source of light can be the sunlight coming in through the glass windows on the roof, but in ordinary filming, most of the time artificial light is still used, because the intensity of artificial light can be changed freely and is easy to control. There are two types of equipment for providing artificial light: the first is the arc lamp, and the second is the mercury lamp. Both of these lamps can emit extremely strong light. The arc lamp device is either a collection of several units of arc lamps, placed on a four-wheeled vehicle, or it is like a searchlight, installed on a movable steel frame. When shooting large scenes, sometimes as many as thirty or forty arc lamps are required, each with a light intensity of 500 amps and a brightness of 10,000 candlepower. Working under such strong light, the actors' eyes are of course easily damaged. To avoid this, a lead glass is usually placed in front of the lamp, which can absorb harmful ultraviolet rays. The brightness of the mercury lamp is also very strong, but it is very soft, does not harm the eyes, and is more economical than the arc lamp. This type of lamp can also be used in ordinary households, but there is one drawback, which is that under the light of the mercury lamp, the skin of people's faces appears grayish-white, which is not very good, but for filming movies, this is not an obstacle at all.

### After Watching "Black Paradise"

— Sha

"Black Paradise" is another work by Wu Cun after "New Hell" with contemporary society as its backdrop. It depicts a simple and innocent girl who, unwilling to bury her future in this evil society, resolutely leaves her sister to live a wandering life. Here, the various aspects of the so-called "Black Paradise" isolated island are set off. Zhou Xuan plays a wandering street girl, which can be said to be the most suitable for her personality. Lan Lan plays a dancer who is seduced by vanity and eventually loses her life, which is quite suitable for her job. Jia Nong does not lose his experienced true colors this time, and the rest are mediocre.

"Black Paradise" does not have the relaxed and satirical scenes of "New Hell" that can make the audience shed tears after a burst of laughter. On the contrary, some places are too contrived, such as the scene where Xiuli does not recognize the glass window and wants to grab the food in the window with her hand.

Perhaps it was because of the rush, the editing is very messy, and the light in some places is not clear. The ending with Lao Gong jumping into the Huangpu River is very inappropriate in my opinion. According to Lao Gong, he is a person who knows how to return when he is lost, and he also believes that Shanghai is a "Black Paradise" and cannot stay any longer. Then why does the director not give him a positive and bright future, but instead makes him commit suicide passively?

Yao Li has been very popular on the radio recently. This time, she was introduced by Zhou Xuan and played a song, and several close-up shots of her face were not bad, but unfortunately she did not have a role to play.

In short, "Black Paradise" is a more conscious and worthwhile film. Finally, I hope that the directors and producers will not blindly focus on business-minded folk films, but for the future of the Chinese film industry, they can shoot more films that are more meaningful than "Black Paradise" and "New Hell."
