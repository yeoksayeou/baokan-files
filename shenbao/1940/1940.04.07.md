### Strictly Urge Registration of Radio Receivers; Registration Is Free

Chongqing: Regarding the registration of radio receivers, the Ministry of Transportation has formulated the Provisional Regulations for the Registration of Radio Receivers, which have been in effect for many years.

There are no other purposes. This registration is also free of charge. (Report from the 5th)

Editorial

### How Will Germany Choose?

To understand the theory of National Socialism, is it not the essence of the special product of Germany and the Germanic race? It is not for export, nor is it imitable, because it is probably inappropriate for other countries and other races. Therefore, when we discuss the Far East issue, we do not want to be attached to the theory of National Socialism as one thing, and we deeply sympathize with its encounter as another. There are sometimes conceptual conflicts between the two; however, on the German side, there are inevitable factual contradictions.

Germany has absolutely no desire for aggression in the Far East, especially in China, that is, it has no political desires or territorial ambitions. If there is no desire for territory or politics, then it can stand aloof from the whirlpool and correct the dispute between right and wrong. Moreover, China and Germany have always had close ties, and China is an ideal market for Germany, so it can seek mutual benefit. However, because of European relations and British relations, Germany has to hesitate between China and Japan. China, of course, does not hesitate to express its regret; but considering that Germany's national foundation is tied to Europe, it is still sympathetic to its own national foundation. Moreover, the natural honesty of the German people is now even more worthy of sympathy because of their loyalty to the nation, even to the point of vainly bending the ruler and not compensating for the straight line. Why is it that vainly bending the ruler does not compensate for the straight line? Germany has been seeking it hard for years; distant things will not be repeated, and forty days ago, it was reported that the German authorities sent Mr. Herfel Rieck as a representative to Tokyo to carefully investigate the internal situation of Japan and its diplomatic tendencies, so that Germany could know how to choose between China and Japan. Germany went to it gently and solemnly, which shows its painstaking efforts; however, in the past four decades, Japan's response in fact and attitude has been as we discussed forty decades ago, "waiting for a good price to sell" and "watching the situation, preparing to throw stones down the well." Yesterday, it was reported again that Duke Sachs-Coburg-Gotha, president of the German Red Cross, will succeed Mr. He as a visitor to Japan, conveying the warm hope of the head of state Hitler, so that Japan can know how to choose between Britain and France and Germany. At the same time, it was also reported about the relationship between Germany and Japan, and Germany's attitude towards the Far East. All the rumors have not been given any concrete proof by the German side, and naturally we do not want to completely believe them easily, but Germany's efforts to "straighten the line" by trying to "bend the ruler" cannot be hidden.

To analyze it frankly: if Germany sacrifices the friendly relations between China and Germany and gives China, which is in the midst of the War of Resistance, a certain degree of difficulty, how can China not complain, but it can only be helpless and work harder to resist Japan; if Germany therefore obtains precious benefits from Japan and greatly helps Germany's determination to win the European War, then China's complaints are not worth Germany's consideration, and it can still be said that it is bending the ruler to straighten the line. But is this the case? The only basis for solving the Far East problem is the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese War. With Germany's strength, what it can do to protect Japan and suppress China during the European War is not enough to reverse the declining trend of Japan's invasion of China, nor is it enough to shake China's belief in final victory. Even if Germany does its best to do so, it cannot give the victory or defeat of China and Japan any powerful influence; therefore, even if Germany is able to negotiate with Japan to strengthen German-Japanese relations, it is an unwise waste to sacrifice Sino-German friendship. Or does Germany estimate Japan's recent remaining strength based on the latest information? Even if Japan's pro-German faction is in power and increases diplomatic relations with Germany, the propaganda and shouting momentum related to diplomatic publicity will be higher than it is now, but in terms of economy and military affairs, what can Germany gain from Japan? Japan's ambition is not here. If it has any remaining economic power, it will definitely consume it in China. If it has any remaining military power, it will definitely consume it in China. It is helpless to Germany, let alone use the remaining strength to protect Germany and fight against Britain? Japan has sincerity towards Germany, and if Germany sends envoys to Japan one after another, the Japanese will definitely bow down to welcome them. If Germany tolerates the facts of the invasion of China to show its intentions to Japan, the Japanese will definitely be grateful and thank them; why? Germany is willing to be Japan's tool, and Japan is happy to take it as capital for coercing Britain. If Germany is happy to mediate between the Soviet Union and Japan, promoting the three countries of Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan into a ring, the momentum will be greatly increased. But what will the facts beyond the momentum seem like? Japan is pro-Soviet and allied with Germany, but is this the beginning of resisting Britain? It only makes Japan's ambition to invade China, which was dying, re-excited by this stimulus, can it really do anything for the European situation? Moreover, with the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and the long-standing grievances between the Soviet Union and Japan, how can they be changed by Germany's mediation?

With the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, if Germany strengthens German-Japanese relations by being a bridge for the Soviet Union and Japan, the trend is reversed and the matter is difficult. With the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, if Germany strengthens Sino-German relations by using the Soviet Union as a bridge, the trend is smooth and the matter is easy. The strengthening of Sino-German relations is of course not that China is about to control its friends and enemies on both sides of the European War; this is not only that Germany has no desire for China, but also that China is unable to do anything for the European War. However, from the perspective of the entire international community, it is not without benefit. If Germany restores its aid-China policy, then Germany, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will at least have common interests in the Far East, that is, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Britain and France do not have to expand the scope of the European War because of the Far East. Even in the Far East, the moral value of Germany's aid to China can restore the simplicity of the international environment of the Far East problem: the simplification of the international environment of the Far East problem can reduce the distance of stability and increase the strength of stability; and the simplicity and stability of the Far East problem directly and indirectly benefit both sides in the European War, both during and after the war. The victory or defeat of the European War is originally in an uncertain state, but the trend of the European War will inevitably eliminate various obstacles to the development of international economy; Germany's grievance argument is poverty, Britain and France's war is full of political colors but does not deny that the war has economic reasons, and the American peace movement takes economy as the theme, these can prove the trend of the European War. Using this trend to measure the Far East, the aggressors in the Far East are planning to build a monopoly barrier; if Germany protects Japan, the objective result will be to help build the Far East barrier, which is fundamentally contrary to the trend of world change.

To sum up, Germany's expectation of Japan's choice between Britain and Germany can be ended; and we Ning hope that Germany will choose between China and Japan.

It was generally believed that the situation had not improved since the expiration of the agreement, and therefore the time was not yet ripe for a new trade agreement. The United States is making every effort to promote a "moral embargo" on general goods exported to Japan, which is a cause for great concern. This new form of economic sanction is clever and powerful, and embodies the spirit of American Far East policy. Japan's efforts to seize markets and obtain raw materials in South American countries have been quite effective. The Japanese authorities should redouble their efforts to enhance friendship with those countries. (5th Havas Dispatch)

Tokyo – In order to promote trade with South American countries, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to hold a meeting of ambassadors to South America in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from May 14 to 18. Attendees include Ambassador to Brazil Kuwajima, Ambassador to Argentina Uchiyama, and all Japanese ambassadors and consuls-general to South America. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send Counselor Kato Gaimatsu, Mizunoe Itaro, acting official of the Commerce Bureau, and Miura Hisao, official of the American Bureau, to attend. The group is scheduled to depart from Yokohama on the Hie Maru on the 16th. After the meeting is completed, a meeting of ambassadors to North and Central America will be held in Washington.

### Japan Eagerly Seeks to Avoid Malicious Inflation, Issues Government Bonds Reaching Over 100 Million, Sakurauchi Hopes People Will Practice Thrift

Hong Kong – Tokyo official dispatch: Finance Minister Sakurauchi delivered a speech at a bank meeting on the 5th, hoping that various savings banks could do their best to promote a thrift movement in order to avoid malicious inflation and facilitate the issuance of government bonds. Sakurauchi said that the government hopes that after the thrift movement is implemented this year (starting April 1), the people's savings can reach 120 million Japanese yen. According to the statistics for March, the daily circulation of Bank of Japan banknotes was 311 million Japanese yen, an increase of 83 million Japanese yen compared to the same period last year. Currently, most of the assets are in the hands of the people, and most of them are deposited in the Bank of Korea or the Bank of Taiwan. From June 7, 1937 to March 31 of this year, the government issued government bonds worth 120 million Japanese yen, of which 103.5 million Japanese yen have been sold, accounting for approximately 83.3%. From January to March 31 of this year, 136.5 million Japanese yen in government bonds were issued, of which 112.9 million Japanese yen have been sold, accounting for approximately 82.2%. Among them, 46.5 million Japanese yen were issued at the end of March. As of the end of March, various savings banks had purchased 69 million Japanese yen in government bonds from the Bank of Japan. It is planned to issue 602 million Japanese yen in government bonds this year, and it is hoped that the banking industry can vigorously assist in the sales to avoid malicious inflation.

### Prices Soar in Various Parts of Japan, Canned Foods All Sold Out, People's Lives Become More Difficult

Tokyo – Prices continue to rise in various parts of Japan, increasing by 1% to 1.5% per month. The new tax procedures, which aim to increase national revenue by 500 million yen annually, have been implemented. It is expected that prices will continue to rise. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the retail price index in 13 major cities in Japan in March of this year increased by 52.3% compared to June 1937, one month before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Imported goods such as alcohol, grains, cloth, medicine, cotton wool fabrics, and canned foods are out of stock. Foreigners find it difficult to purchase items such as matches, sugar, butter, flour, and meat, and their prices have mostly doubled within the past twelve months. It is expected that living will be even more difficult in the current fiscal year starting April 1, because after the National Diet passed the new tax procedures for revised consumption and entertainment taxes, the prices of various products, luxury goods, clothing, food, and beverages have all increased. Gasoline, kerosene, and all other oils have all increased in price due to the implementation of new taxes, the tightening of exchange rates, and the increase in freight and insurance costs. Taxi and public transportation fares will also increase. Since the beginning of this month, tax authorities and various shops have been revising the prices of sugar, local wine, beer, and various goods due to the tax increase, increasing them by 12%. Even cats and dogs in toy stores with a selling price of more than 10 yen have labels hanging around their necks stating "Livestock Tax 11%, Amounting to So Many Foreign Currency." Purchases of sugar and pastries exceeding 3 yen are also subject to an 11% tax. Local wine is taxed at 15 yen per 40 gallons, and the beer tax has increased by 59 yen and 20 sen. Restaurants and taverns that employ five or more waitresses also charge a 15% tax on invoices exceeding 3 yen. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

### US President Issues Letter to Soldiers, Expresses Appreciation for Domestic and Overseas Army's Efforts in National Defense

Washington – Today is the 23rd anniversary of the United States' participation in the last European War. President Roosevelt issued a letter to the soldiers of the national army, stating, "Last September, I asked the soldiers of the country to make every effort to strengthen national defense within the limits permitted by peacetime. After receiving the order, the soldiers of the army have all worked hard to be effective, and even the troops stationed on overseas islands have been enterprising and have made the same innovations to the defense of distant areas, which is commendable."

### Assistant Secretary of War Delivers Speech, Does Not Allow Sale of Military Secrets

New York – Yesterday was the anniversary of the United States' participation in the last World War. Assistant Secretary of War Johnson delivered a speech at a banquet last night, stating that the biggest problem if the United States encounters war is the ability of American industry to supply military supplies and equipment. According to the War Department's plan, the army's quota can be expanded to one million people within four months. The number of skilled workers in aircraft and engine factories has increased from 30,000 to 75,000 in one year. The American people do not want to profit from the European war, but it would be unwise if the American people could not understand that war has already occurred in Europe. Regarding the purchase of American aircraft by Western European countries, we do not need to worry about the leakage of military secrets and the weakening of the United States' national defense institutions after the sale of new-style aircraft. The War Department will never allow the sale of any military secrets. (6th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

### Pope to Express Support for Chongqing Government, Japan Should Be Responsible for Damage to Churches in China, Japanese Newspaper Believes "China Incident" Difficult to Resolve

Rome – According to authoritative Vatican sources, the Roman Catholic Pope has decided to express support for General Chiang Kai-shek after thoroughly studying the situation in China. Since the Vatican has no diplomatic representatives in China, there is no question of recognizing or denying the "regime." However, the Pope's representatives in China often report the situation in China to the Vatican. The Pope will express his support based on these reports. According to well-informed Vatican sources, the Pope's representatives in China have reported to the Vatican that they do not believe the "Wang regime" will last long, and that Japan's actions in China have caused no damage to the National Government. In the areas under Japanese control, one bishop and many priests have been killed. Although some churches in China have been robbed, the responsibility for the destruction of the churches should be borne by the Japanese. (6th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo – "Kokumin Shimbun," known for representing the military, recently published an article in "Looking Out," commenting on the "new regime" in Nanjing, stating that the Japanese government has always disregarded reality. The establishment of the "new regime" in Nanjing is an excellent opportunity for the Japanese government to reconsider this attitude. It would be a serious misunderstanding to think that the emergence of this "new regime" can resolve the China Incident. It should be known that our task is to find a way to make this "new regime" a cornerstone of peace and a political link between China and Japan. In order to accomplish this task, we must gain the support of the Chinese people and ensure that the China under the new "regime" does not use its new unity to confront Japan, as the Chiang Kai-shek government did, in order to be successful. (5th Havas Dispatch)

Santiago, Chile – A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared yesterday that the Chilean government will not express any position on the issue of recognition of the "New Nanjing Government" of Wang Jingwei until it receives formal notification. Unofficial sources said that the Chilean government is extremely skeptical about the recognition of the "New Government," and pointed out that the Chinese Embassy here recently notified the Chilean government that recognizing the "Nanjing Regime" would be regarded as an unfriendly act towards China.

### Japanese "Ship" Aground, Soviet Radio Broadcasts Continue to Attack Japan

Moscow – Soviet radio stations broadcast news today, continuing to attack Japan and the "Wang Jingwei regime." Tonight, an article published in the Komsomolskaya Pravda will be broadcast, which states, "Japanese industry is exploited by the country's imperialists and is now dying. The Japanese 'ship' has run aground on Chinese 'rocks' and is trying to carry out 'internal work' to seize China, but the Chinese people are unwilling to be shackled and become slaves, and are continuing to resist aggression." In addition, it was announced that photos and various documents about the life and career of Lenin were recently on public display in Chongqing, China, under the auspices of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, and several films about the Soviet military power were screened.

### US Flagship Runs Aground, Slight Damage, Sails to Philippine Island for Inspection

Washington – Naval circles claimed yesterday that the US Asian Fleet ship "Augusta" ran aground near Hong Kong earlier this week, suffering "slight damage."

### Japanese Warships Gather in Waters off Taiwan, Preparing to Hold Exercises, Aimed at US Naval Maneuvers in Pacific, Simultaneously Demonstrating to Britain and France

Chongqing – According to well-informed Chinese sources, in retaliation for the US naval maneuvers in the Pacific and the increase in the British and French fleets stationed in the Far East, Japan has decided to concentrate its warships, naval aircraft, and auxiliary warships in the waters off Taiwan, and will soon hold exercises between Taiwan and the South China Sea. On March 30, about 60 warships (including three aircraft carriers carrying 200 aircraft and 30 submarines) arrived in Xiamen. The Japanese naval authorities held a meeting on Gulangyu the next day. Chinese sources believe that Japan's exercise this time is a retaliatory action against the United States. (6th United Press Dispatch)

### Japan Begins to Expand Military, Division Commander Meeting to be Held Early Next Month

Tokyo – Japan is about to embark on a huge new military expansion program, with a six-year period, wanting to make Japan an armed power that cannot be threatened by external forces, its total cost is 3,720,000,000 Japanese yen, which has been voted by the National Diet, the Military Equipment Headquarters will be established, with the task of guiding and managing the military expansion program, and adjusting the procurement, manufacture and repair of war equipment, and allocating various troops on a reasonable basis, and military aviation factories will also be established, with the technical assistance of the Army Aviation Technology and Hygiene Research Institute, which will be greatly expanded and renovated, manufacturing the latest type of army aircraft, with particular emphasis on the manufacture of army aircraft for training, the treatment of technical officers will be greatly improved in the future, in order to attract the most capable talents, to build the most effective weapons within the scope of modern science, and the Ordnance Headquarters will also be established to uniformly handle all matters relating to the manufacture, storage and distribution of ordnance, since until now, the management of ordnance manufacture and army equipment, such as the supply of munitions, the manufacture and storage of ordnance, and the distribution of ordnance, has lacked uniformity and has not been streamlined. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo – The Japanese Army has scheduled a meeting of division commanders from the 9th to the 11th of next month.

### Britain's Negotiations with Japan Not Inclined to Compromise, Tianjin Silver Issue Can be Resolved Within Days, Britain Particularly Does Not Interfere with Japanese Trade with Dutch East Indies

London – According to well-informed sources, certain British-Japanese problems may be resolved within days. The Tianjin silver issue, which has been in dispute for ten months, may be adjusted next week. It is generally predicted that of the Chinese silver stored in the British Concession in Tianjin worth £800,000, £100,000 may be used to relieve the North China floods, and the remaining £700,000 will remain sealed in the Bank of Communications of China for various practical purposes. If Japan participates in this treatment, it may lift the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. It is generally believed that Japan very much wants to avoid British interference in its trade with the Dutch East Indies. If Japan does not ship rubber and other goods to Vladivostok and allows these goods to be transferred to Germany, Britain may allow non-interference in Japanese commerce with the Dutch East Indies. In addition, Japan is also in great need of sheepskin, and now, because Britain has purchased all of Australia's wool, Japan has no choice but to obtain supplies from London. Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax on Wednesday and British Undersecretary Butler on Thursday, perhaps to discuss these issues. (6th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo – An editorial in the "Kokumin Shimbun" today stated that if Britain expands its blockade network throughout the world, Japan will be greatly affected. The trade relations between Japan, Manchuria, and Germany are one of the pillars of Japan's foreign trade, and this will be in danger of breaking down. The Japanese government has decided to instruct Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu to begin negotiations to protect neutral trade. The Japanese government's points of contention are two: (1) The British government's expanded interpretation of contraband is an abuse of the rights of belligerents, so Japan absolutely cannot accept it; (2) Vladivostok is currently serving as Germany's eastern port. Japan fears that the European war may disrupt the waters near Japan. When Japan is pursuing its policy of non-involvement in the European war, it will absolutely not allow the waters near it to be disturbed. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

### Japanese People Gather, Arita Delivers Speech

Tokyo – 100,000 people gathered in Hibiya Park in central Tokyo this afternoon to welcome Abe. During the meeting, Foreign Minister Arita stated that some third-country bandits still do not understand Japan's military actions in China, and even refuse to pay attention to reality. Some countries adopt a policy of not recognizing the "new regime" in China, and some countries go further, attempting to hinder the realization of Japan's war aims in China and obstructing the construction of the "New Order in East Asia." However, no matter what attitude the third countries take, the established policy of the Japanese Empire will not waver. Making the "new regime" grow and become an effective and stable government is Japan's important task. If one believes that economic pressure is sufficient to force Japan to change its established policy, then the assessment of the actual situation is extremely erroneous. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

### US-Mexico Oil Dispute, Hull Proposes Submitting to Arbitration

### British Bomber Squadrons Reconnoiter German Naval Port, Four German Ships Attacked, All British Aircraft Return Safely to Original Defense

London – The British Air Force Ministry stated that yesterday afternoon a squadron of British bombers penetrated the German defense line, reconnoitered the Wilhelmshaven naval port, and dropped bombs to attack an enemy ship in the port. Four German destroyers to the south were also attacked by British aircraft and were determined to have been damaged. All British aircraft flew safely back to their original defense. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

London – British observers are now watching whether the Royal Air Force will continue to conduct air raids on other German bases after bombing Wilhelmshaven, as this is a sign of intensified war efforts after the cabinet reshuffle. Yesterday's air raid was the first air force activity since Sir Hoare took over from Sir Wood as Minister of Aviation on Wednesday. Air Force Ministry officials said that the attack could not be regarded as a "great achievement," as the British aircraft were only making a reconnaissance flight, believing that they could drop bombs when high in the clouds. It is said that Sir Hoare is merely continuing Britain's "an eye for an eye" policy of the past April. (6th United Press)

Berlin – A Huitong News Agency reporter learned from responsible sources that the news about the bombing of German warships near Wilhelmshaven is pure fabrication. Only one British aircraft flew to the Elbe River estuary on the afternoon of the 4th. Due to intense anti-aircraft fire, it only dropped two bombs, both of which landed in the water. There were no air raid targets nearby. (6th Huitong Dispatch)

### British Fishing Boat Attacked by Air, One Sunk, German Aircraft Release Aerial Torpedoes

London – Five British fishing boats were attacked by German aircraft after sailing out of Aberystwyth on Wednesday. One of them, named "Cosborne," was sunk by a bomb. The crew members were rescued in lifeboats. The "Bracon," although attacked, was not injured. According to the crew members of the fishing boats, the German aircraft released aerial torpedoes after dropping bombs. The British Admiralty recently issued a communiqué stating that it is still difficult to say whether German submarines have lost their activity, but in the past ten days, no British ships have been sunk by German submarines. This situation may be due to the German side lacking personnel for underwater attacks, or it may be lacking submarines. (5th United Press Dispatch)

### South Atlantic: Captured German Ship Towed into the River Thames

### Britain and France Pressure Nordic Countries: Urge Clarification of Neutral Stance; Notes Sent to Norwegian and Swedish Governments Respectively; New Blocking Policy is Inevitable

London: Foreign Secretary Halifax recently delivered a note to the Swedish and Norwegian ministers. Diplomatic circles here are keeping the contents of the note secret, only saying that its aim is to clarify the attitude of Britain and France towards the neutral policies of these countries. (Havas, 5th)

London: The British government today sent documents to Norway and Sweden, seeking clarity on the neutrality issue of the Scandinavian Peninsula. This action is the result of Britain's announcement of a new blockade method. According to British officials, the new blockade method may affect neutral countries, but it is imperative to weaken Germany's power. They said that if it is not done, then when it is done, it will "not stop until a fatal blow is dealt to Germany." Foreign Secretary Halifax met with the Norwegian and Swedish ministers and handed them two notes to be forwarded to their respective governments. The notes concern various issues affecting the relations between the Allies and the Scandinavian countries in general. The aim is to ask the Scandinavian countries to clarify their attitude towards events related to their neutrality. Some diplomats in London believe that this move is a sign of the Allies putting pressure on these two countries to prevent Germany from trading with the Scandinavian countries. It is reported that Moscow's radio station has fiercely criticized the Norwegian government, while Berlin's radio station has claimed that the Allies are discussing how to send troops to land in Norway. Furthermore, French Minister of Blockade, Monnet, stated today that the Allies' economic blockade is being strengthened and expanded, and that Germany's heavy industries have already felt the difficulties due to the blockade, with many factories closing down and workers becoming unemployed. Before making this statement, Monnet had consulted with British Minister of Economic Warfare, Cross, for many days. (Special Correspondent Hua Zeng, International News Service, 6th)

Stockholm: Political circles here announced today that Sweden and Norway are currently cooperating closely and actively preparing to deal with any situation, with particular emphasis on Britain's diplomatic actions. They also said that to avoid various difficulties, Norway is very willing to prevent the transport of iron ore from Narvik to Germany, but such action by Norway would inevitably be applied to Britain as well. Political circles added that the British Foreign Office has notified the Norwegian Ambassador to Britain that Britain does not intend to take any diplomatic action aimed at preventing Swedish iron ore from being transported to Germany via Bosnia. (Associated Press, 6th)

Stockholm: The Swedish Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee met this morning to consider the notes from Britain and France. According to official statements, the contents of the British and French notes are the same, detailing the attitude of the Allied countries towards the current Scandinavian issue, especially the situation after the end of the Soviet-Finnish conflict. It is generally speculated that the contents of the notes are the Allied countries requesting Norway and Sweden to immediately stop German ships from transporting wartime contraband. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

Britain Convening Conference of Envoys: Discussion of the Balkan Situation

London: Well-informed sources here recently stated that the British envoys to the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube region have been summoned back to the country to report on their duties and have arrived here one after another. Important discussions are scheduled to begin on the 8th of this month. It is still unknown whether the format will be a general meeting or whether Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will meet with the envoys separately for discussions. The most important issues to be discussed will be Italy and the Soviet Union. British diplomatic representatives to Italy and the Soviet Union have submitted reports on the situation in each country. As for the general situation in Southeast Europe, the position of Britain and France there has improved since the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. Since the heads of Germany and Italy held talks in the Brenner Pass, the division of the Balkan Peninsula into German, Greek, and Soviet spheres of influence has become a bubble. However, Italy's ambitions in the Balkan Peninsula remain the same. Prime Minister Mussolini's attitude towards Britain and France is becoming increasingly unfavorable. It is highly possible that the country will not join the war against Britain and France, or will develop an anti-British and anti-French tendency. The British government will certainly consider all these points before deciding on diplomatic action in the Balkan Peninsula. In addition, Britain's economic policy in the Balkan Peninsula will also be submitted for discussion. Subsequently, the British authorities will purchase a large number of raw materials from the Balkan countries, which are also the various raw materials needed by Germany, thereby avoiding providing resources to the enemy and enhancing the economic position of each country, so that they can resist external pressure politically. In short, Britain may not take action immediately. The first step will be to intensify economic action, and then study the military strategy. (Havas Special Dispatch, 5th)

### Romania Separately Conducting Economic Negotiations with Britain and Germany: British-Romanian Trade Relations Need to Be Re-Adjusted; Financial Issues Are the Focus of German-Romanian Discussions

London: The Romanian financial and economic delegation, led by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance, Jordan, arrived here a few days ago to conduct business talks with the British authorities. Financial circles here recently stated that the main goal of the talks is to establish a new foundation for business relations. The business agreement previously concluded between the two sides in July last year, before the outbreak of the European war, was applicable to peacetime trade. Now, even if it is not revised, it should be adjusted. After the agreement was signed last year, Britain provided Romania with credit of more than 5.5 million pounds for the purchase of British goods (including military supplies). It is reported that this loan has been fully used, so the current talks have involved the issue of new loans. At the same time, Britain should purchase more goods from Romania to increase the country's purchasing power. In this regard, the newly established "British Trading Company Limited" by the British government should make efforts to promote trade relations between Britain and Romania. (Havas, 5th)

Bucharest: The Director of the Economic Department of the German Foreign Ministry, Krollmuss, held talks with the Romanian Minister of Finance and President of the National Bank, Constantinescu, yesterday afternoon for a long time. According to well-informed sources here, the focus of the discussions was on various financial issues. First, Germany requested an increase in the exchange rate of the mark, which the Romanian government would not accept. It is reported that Krollmuss, in view of the fact that after the previous increase in the exchange rate of the mark, German goods generally increased in price in the Romanian market, which was detrimental to Germany, did not insist on the above request. Second, regarding the issue of trade balance between Germany and Romania, due to the failure of a large number of German industrial products to be delivered on time, the total amount of Romania's surplus to Germany has reached 250 million lei, and it is not yet known how to clear it. Third, Germany requested Romania to reduce the export tax rate on grain exported to Germany, which the Romanian authorities also seem unable to accept. However, from April 1st, the export tax rates for several other types of goods exported to Germany have been reduced appropriately. In addition, it is reported that Krollmuss's stay in Bucharest will likely be extended by three weeks because the current business negotiations have not yet reached an agreement. However, in any case, there will be no major changes in the business relationship between the two countries. Economic circles also said that Germany did not request an increase in the quantity of oil supplied this time, so the subsequent discussions on this issue will still be limited to the implementation of the current agreement. (Havas, 5th)

### Rise and Fall of British, French, and German Trade with Romania: German Exports Rank First

Bucharest: According to statistics released yesterday by the Romanian Economic Survey Bureau, from September to December 1939, the percentage of German goods in Romania's total imports increased from 41.4% to 63.7%. During the same period, the percentage of British and French goods decreased from 25.3% to 10.2%. Romania's exports to France decreased from 1,759,000,000 lei (Romanian currency) in 1936 to 915,000,000 lei, a large decrease of half. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

### Soviet Union Urges Britain to Improve Trade Relations: Talks in London

London: A Reuter diplomatic correspondent stated that Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, recently visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax to discuss the improvement of British-Soviet trade relations. The Soviet side believes that if the Allies improve trade with the Soviet Union, the Allies will directly benefit, and the Soviet Union will also indirectly benefit. Because the mutual assistance agreements between the Soviet Union and Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia all stipulate that transportation facilities through the Soviet Union will be provided to the Baltic countries. Therefore, if Britain improves trade with the Soviet Union, it can obtain goods from the Baltic countries from Murmansk or the Black Sea ports. Not only Soviet goods, but also Soviet transportation tools can make this route convenient, which is not without doubt. However, the Soviet Union is now using this suggestion as part of its argument for restoring normal trade relations between the Allies and the Soviet Union. (Reuter, 6th)

### Italian Minister of Agriculture Visits Budapest

Budapest: Italian Minister of Agriculture, Tessina, arrived here yesterday afternoon, following German Minister of Agriculture, Darré. The Yugoslav Minister of Agriculture, Gubrellovic, and Minister Without Portfolio, Constantinovic, returned to their country yesterday after coming here to hold talks with the Hungarian authorities. Officials here recently stated that the visits of the ministers of agriculture from Yugoslavia, Germany, and Italy in succession are generally expected to lead to an understanding on agricultural issues between the governments of Yugoslavia, Germany, Italy, and Hungary, but the result has not been as desired. (Havas, 6th)

### British Army Chief of Staff Discusses the War Situation: Britain is Now Fully Prepared; German Strategy Missed its Opportunity

London: The British Army Chief of Staff, General Ironside, met with journalists at the War Office yesterday and stated that the Allies had seven months to calmly arrange the army to make it perfect. This is what the Allies deeply feel. At the beginning of the war, the Allies had almost no army to speak of. If Germany had launched a fierce attack at that time, the result would have been chilling to think about now. It was not until two weeks ago that we entered the real road to recovery. Now we are fully prepared. The German army is a kind of amazing machine, but none of the colonels and above in the army have served in the last war, while the British and French armies have many generals and officers who have gained experience in the last war. There may be people in the German army who are deeply knowledgeable in strategy, but he cannot help but doubt this, because most of the army commanders are familiar to him, and he knows very well how difficult they will feel to attack once they are ordered to advance. They could have won an attack six months ago, but not now. As for the Soviet Union, the Finnish war has exhausted the Soviet Union and weakened its food sources. The Soviet Union may start a scene elsewhere. If so, the battlefield should be at the end of a very long transportation line, and this transportation line is not easy to maintain. The Soviet Union will further weaken its own strength. (Reuter, 6th)

### The European Map Incident: Causes a Great Uproar; Roman Newspaper Severely Criticizes Britain and France; Do Not Forget That Insults Will Be Settled One Day

Rome: The "strange map" in French Prime Minister Reynaud's office has caused a great uproar in Italy. The "Italian People's Newspaper," the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, published three articles on the front page today, severely criticizing Britain and France. It stated that the Italian nation had previously suffered various insults (referring to the era of the Italian-Abyssinian War). It would be ridiculous for foreign countries to think that we have forgotten it indifferently. It must be known that our slogan is "Do not forget." We will never forget the repeated obstacles made by Britain and France. Diplomats sometimes respect each other and smile at each other, but this kind of smile is very different from the smile of the people. Often, although it is a smile on the surface, it is not in reality. Therefore, our Prime Minister Mussolini often handles diplomacy in public in the square, and when it is necessary to take a historic decision, he must consult public opinion in advance. Therefore, countries that want to know Italy's true attitude should seek clarity from this. We see that the so-called "Reynaud's map" confirms that the war goal of Britain and France is to force other European countries to accept the second edition of the Treaty of Versailles. The content of this second edition is worse than the first edition, no less than a second dismemberment of the nations. There is only one thing to tell Britain and France, that is, if these countries force others to accept this kind of peace treaty, our Italian side will meet it with ten million bayonets. In short, we not only demand that Britain and France clear the old debts, but also demand to settle the new accounts. (Havas, 6th)

### German International Law Expert Criticizes the War Goals of Britain and France

Berlin: Professor Grimm, a well-known German international law expert, who defended Germans in French military courts during the occupation of the Ruhr, gave a radio speech yesterday, saying: "The European map published in the French 'Picture Weekly' shows the dream of French Prime Minister Reynaud, and has also revealed the war goals of the Allies. This map divides Germany and has exceeded the harsh provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. The people who decided on this map seem to have failed to accept the lessons of history. A fragmented Germany, located in a Balkanized Europe, will be a source of instability. The German people have already understood during the occupation of the Ruhr that after accepting the rule of Western European countries, they only have the freedom to write poetry and play music." Professor Grimm's conclusion declared that Reynaud's map is helpful in determining war responsibility. Those who harbor infinite war goals obviously hope to start a war. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

### The So-Called Strange Map: Turns Out to Be Like This

Paris: It is rumored that when U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles and French Prime Minister Reynaud (former Minister of Finance) held talks here a few days ago, there was a European map hanging in Reynaud's office, in which the Italian port of Trieste was listed in Austrian territory. At that time, a photo was taken and published in a French magazine, which was dissatisfied by the Italian side. In order to dispel the misunderstanding, Prime Minister Reynaud specially invited many domestic and foreign journalists to his office today to read this map and know that this map was drawn in March 1938, before Germany annexed Austria. However, in order to compare the situation at that time with the changes at this time, new boundary lines were added to the map, such as the boundary between Germany and the Soviet Union dividing Poland. However, the boundary lines between Switzerland and Denmark were not very clear. At first glance, they seemed to have become part of Germany. As for the Balkan Peninsula, it was not drawn into the map, so it can be seen that the "map incident," which caused a sensation at the time, actually has no significance. (Havas, 5th)

### Reynaud Cabinet's Position Gradually Stabilizing

Paris: Observers around the world recently stated that the majority vote obtained by the Reynaud cabinet in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday has increased compared to before. Although most of the deputies still abstained yesterday, all parties unanimously expressed their support for actively fighting the war and closely cooperating with Britain. Prime Minister Reynaud does not have a major party as his backing, and his position in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies is quite special. If he cannot obtain the support of the Radical Socialist Party, it will be difficult to continue to govern. Therefore, he once requested that important members of the Radical Socialist Party join the cabinet and cooperate with him, and finally got his wish, that is, the leader of the party, Daladier, also continued to serve as Minister of National Defense. However, the opinions of the Radical Socialist Party caucus in the Chamber of Deputies were originally inconsistent. It was not until yesterday that it was decided to require the government to automatically submit general policies for discussion, instead of raising questions during the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies. It can be seen that the party caucus has expressed goodwill to the Reynaud cabinet. (Havas, 5th)

### Italy: Collecting Scrap Iron for National Defense Needs

Rome: "The Italian Daily" published an article by Gaeta, which stated that Italy can obtain at least one million tons by dismantling iron gates in various places. Italy has already ordered the dismantling of iron gates to increase the storage of iron. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)

Rome: Italy is currently stepping up the collection of scrap iron, and various newspapers are publishing articles to advise readers to send useless iron items such as lamps, statues, mailboxes, iron fences, etc. to iron factories for melting. "The Italian Daily" also published an article, which stated: "At this important juncture in the history of Europe and Italy, economic warfare is as important as artillery. If our country participates in the war to safeguard its rights, then one more weapon made can save ten soldiers from sacrificing. All citizens should actively support this scrap iron collection movement." (Havas, 6th)

### German Technicians: Sidelined in the Soviet Union; Unable to Perform Duties; Apply to the Government for Repatriation

Bucharest: According to news from Sernovtsy, German technicians working in Soviet industrial areas have recently submitted applications to the German Embassy in the Soviet Union, requesting to be repatriated to their home country. The reason is that Soviet technicians and workers often deliberately make things difficult for these German technicians, making it impossible for them to work. The reason for this is that in the past eight years, foreign technicians working for the Soviet Union have mostly received high salaries and generous benefits, which has been envied by Soviet technicians and workers. Over time, it has almost become a xenophobic habit. In this situation, even if the Soviet government has the intention of treating these German technicians differently, these technicians are really suffering from having no place to use their talents, so they have to retreat in the face of difficulties.

### America's Attitude Towards the European Situation - Item No. 9 of Important Polish Documents -

Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry last night released the ninth official document from the important Polish archives, a report from Polish Ambassador to France Łukaszewicz to the Polish Foreign Minister in February 1939. The original text is as follows:

"Last week, the American Ambassador to France, Bullitt, returned here after a three-month vacation in the United States. After two conversations with him, I respectfully submit the impressions I gained, as well as the report on American policy toward the European situation, as follows: (1) American foreign policy intends to directly intervene in the European situation, but public opinion still holds an isolationist attitude. At the same time, the American people are paying much more attention to the European situation than before, even more than to domestic affairs. American officials generally believe that the situation is extremely serious and that Britain and France will go to war with Germany and Italy. If Britain and France fail, Germany will turn to develop on the American continent. Therefore, the United States should participate in the war on the side of Britain and France after the war begins. Bullitt stated, "If war breaks out, we will not participate in the initial battles, but we will definitely bring it to a halt." Although President Roosevelt does not consider the Rhine River to be the border of the United States, he does explicitly state that the United States sells aircraft to France because the French army is the first line of defense for the United States. (2) Italy's demands on France are unfounded, and France should not make any concessions. The United States is willing to give France strong support in this regard. Even if Britain wants to reach an understanding with Germany and sacrifice France, the United States will prevent it. Britain's prestige, in the eyes of American public opinion and the general public, has plummeted due to recent events in the Far East and the Munich Conference. Although the American attitude has been decided, it cannot obtain a positive solution to the European problem due to the opposition of the isolationist faction. (3) In short, President Roosevelt's policy can be summarized in one sentence: supporting France's resistance to the oppression of Germany and Italy, while putting pressure on Britain to prevent it from compromising with Germany and Italy." Signed, Polish Ambassador to France Łukaszewicz. (Sixth Daily News Agency Telegraph)

Polish Ambassador to the US Diplomatic Report

After Polish Ambassador to the US Potocki held a second conversation with US Ambassador to France Bullitt, his second report to the Polish Foreign Minister on January 16, 1939, was recently announced by the German Foreign Ministry in the form of a White Paper. The content is as follows:

"The day before yesterday, US Ambassador to France Bullitt visited the embassy and had a frank conversation. It is understood that he will return to his post in Paris on the 21st of this month, as he has been back to the country for three months. This time he returns with President Roosevelt's major transfer order. Based on the results of the conversation, I have the impression that President Roosevelt has a very clear attitude towards the existing European war, which Bullitt will convey to the French Foreign Ministry. The content is as follows: (1) President Roosevelt's foreign policy deeply hates totalitarian states. (2) The United States is preparing to engage in combat in the sea, land, and air, stepping up preparations, and allocating $1,250,000,000. (3) The United States believes that Britain and France must break the idea of compromising with totalitarian states and refuse to discuss revising territories. (4) The United States guarantees to abandon its isolationist policy and decides to assist Britain and France, willing to supply Britain and France with all raw materials and wealth for war. Bullitt went on to talk about Franco-Italian relations, believing that clashes between the two countries were inevitable, but France alone could defeat Italy's sea and land forces. At most, Germany would provide moral support. Bullitt also spoke about Polish policy, saying that after the crisis last fall, Poland's position had become consolidated. Bullitt asked me about Polish-Soviet relations. I replied that all the rumors were purely speculative. It was necessary to establish a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland because since the Czech incident, Soviet-Polish relations had deteriorated greatly, and it was urgent to adjust them to restore them to normal. At the same time, Poland had to develop toward the Soviet Union in order to seek markets. Bullitt's attitude toward Soviet Russia was extremely unfriendly. He also believed that Germany would not attack Eastern Europe in the short term. First, Poland's strength was very strong. Secondly, the attitudes of Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia were still unclear. Therefore, it was believed that some preparations must be made to consolidate the position before any action could be taken. Bullitt believed that Germany would implement its plan for Ukraine, but would not launch it before 1940. I asked whether Britain and France would use military intervention if it were realized. Bullitt replied that Britain and France had completely abandoned the plan for military intervention in German aggression." Signed, Polish Ambassador to the US Potocki.

The Discovery of Polish Documents

Krakow: Regarding the discovery of Polish secret archives, the "Warsaw Daily" confirms that the former Polish Foreign Ministry began sorting out valuables, such as silver and furs, and important documents, starting on September 2, 1939, in preparation for transporting them to a safe location. All sorting and collection was done under the personal supervision of senior officials of the Foreign Ministry. Foreign Minister Beck apparently did not want to publicize the matter, so on the one hand, he delivered a radio address on September 3, calling on the Polish people to continue the resistance, and on the other hand, he ordered the directors of the various departments of the ministry to personally collect important documents and transport them to the railway station by car at night. However, due to overcrowding of military transport, the valuables had already been transported inland, while the important documents were still left at the station. Colonel Beck then fled inland with his wife and daughter on the night of the 6th, without having time to carry the documents. (Sixth Daily News Agency Telegraph)

### Australia Recruits Troops for Overseas Combat

Sydney: Australia has decided to assume a greater share in the British Empire's war effort, so it has decided to recruit 48,000 people to form a complete army corps and sufficient reinforcements to serve overseas. It is planned to recruit a total of 90,000 people by June of next year, of which 20,000 have already been recruited and organized into the 6th Division. The Australian Federal Government has prepared a program for the first two years of the war, which will cost no less than 180 million yuan. According to this program, Australia plans to send an army cooperation team from the Australian Air Force overseas, which is necessary for training Australian troops, so that they can cooperate with the army on the battlefield. It also plans to send a railway surveying company, three railway laying companies, and two forestry companies, requiring a total of 40 officers and 1,203 other soldiers. The Australian Minister for the Army said that it would not be difficult to recruit 90,000 soldiers, but it would not be possible to prepare clothing and equipment in a short time, so the recruitment will be delayed for several weeks.

### The Japanese Side Still Plots to Invade Fujian Province - Training Puppet Troops, Buying Off Pirates, Intensifying Intelligence, Sowing Discord Among Overseas Chinese

Fuzhou Correspondence: The puppet troops under Huang Dawei have been reorganized into a division by the ×× Group Army of the Chinese side after their uprising in Haicheng and stationed in a certain area in western Fujian for training. However, the Japanese and puppet schemes against southern Fujian have not stopped. According to information obtained from various sources, the following is the situation:

(1) Regarding the puppet troops, more than a thousand strong men and fishermen have been forcibly conscripted in Chenghai, Nan'ao, Jinmen, and other places in the past month and concentrated in Chenghai for continued training.

(2) Military personnel have recruited pirates and organized them into the "Fujian People's Army." In southern Fujian, more than 500 people have been recruited and called the "First Army," with pirate leaders Zhang Yizhou and Huang Yushu as puppet commanders and deputy commanders, stationed in Xiamen. In eastern Fujian, more than 1,000 people have been recruited and called the "Second Army," with pirate leaders Yu Guqing and Wang Fuming as puppet commanders and deputy commanders, stationed on Xiaomaiyu and Dongsha Islands. They are still plotting to organize puppet detachments on various islands and coastal areas.

(3) The reason why the Japanese and puppet troops have repeatedly failed in their attempts to invade Dongshan, Zhao'an, Haicheng, and Zhangpu is that they have miscalculated the defensive strength of Fujian Province. Therefore, the Japanese side has recently intensified its intelligence work in Fujian Province. In addition to ordering the original Japanese special service agencies in Xiamen, Shantou, Jinmen, Nan'ao, and other places to step up their work, they are also recruiting traitors from Fujian to infiltrate various counties in southwestern Fujian and conduct activities. On the one hand, they are ordering trained hooligans to make trouble in Gulangyu and deliberately be arrested by the Public Works Bureau and sent inland to spy on military weaknesses.

(4) There are more than 3 million overseas Chinese from Fujian Province, who have strongly supported the War of Resistance. Because the Japanese and puppets have repeatedly failed in their small-scale invasions of Fujian, they are thinking of using threats and inducements to recruit overseas Chinese and sow discord among overseas Chinese in order to weaken Fujian Province's war of resistance strength. In addition to sending traitors to various parts of Southeast Asia to lobby and provoke (Huang Lianfang, who was assassinated in Gulangyu in early February, was an important traitor engaged in recruiting overseas Chinese), they have also established a "Overseas Chinese Reception Center" in Xiamen in the hope of luring returning overseas Chinese, but the overseas Chinese deeply understand the righteousness, and very few are deceived.

Education News

### National Education Conference - Progress and Important Resolutions (Continued from yesterday)

Third, regarding teacher training: (1) It was decided to adjust current teachers as soon as possible. The main points are as follows: (A) Education administrative agencies below the provincial level should set up special personnel sections or special personnel to pay attention to handling and improving all matters related to personnel management. (B) Each province and city should uniformly conduct examinations for existing elementary school and mass school teachers. For the principals of selected central schools and national schools, short-term training of one to three months should be conducted. For unqualified teachers whose academic ability is still acceptable, they should be gathered in batches and given three to six months of training, to be completed before the end of 1932. (2) It was decided to step up the cultivation of teachers. The main points are as follows: (A) The percentage of national education teachers cultivated in each province and city should increase year by year, and should reach at least sixty percent by the end of the third phase. Each should also formulate a plan for cultivating teachers according to needs, and establish normal schools and classes year by year. (B) In order to meet current urgent needs, each province and city may, in large quantities, give priority to running simple normal courses and special normal courses. (C) Normal schools and simple normal schools may adopt a training-internship system, such as two years of training and two years or one year of internship for type A simple normal schools, followed by two years of training, and two years of training and two years or one year of internship for normal schools, followed by one year of training. (D) Each province and city should set up scholarships for outstanding normal school students from poor families, giving 60 yuan per person per year. (E) Local authorities should order local education administrative agencies to provide free meals for normal school students in areas where they are not exempt from food expenses.

Fourth, regarding administration: (1) It was decided that the provincial education administrative agency should have a section in charge of national education, and may include normal education and county (city) education administrative matters under the jurisdiction of this section. It was also decided that the candidate for section chief should have qualifications commensurate with the position. (2) It was decided that the county education administrative agency, which should set up a county education bureau, may postpone its abolition. Those that were originally a joint construction and education section should be quickly changed to a special section. (3) It was decided on the provisional guidelines for handling county education administration, which has detailed regulations on the organizational structure, personnel selection, and responsibilities of county-level education administration, and decided on the points to note in handling county education administration, in order to increase administrative efficiency. (4) The principles of the national education inspection system were determined to be roughly: 1. The country is divided into several supervisory districts, each district being supervised by Ministry supervisors and inspectors who lead the district's provincial-level supervisors and supervisors in their work. 2. Each province is divided into several districts, with inspectors and supervisors set up in each district's education department, who supervise the county-level supervisors and supervisors in their work. 3. The county sets up inspectors to supervise the township-level instructors in their work.

Fifth, regarding teaching materials, textbooks, and teaching equipment: (1) It was decided on the methods for supplying textbooks and alleviating book shortages. The main points are as follows: (A) On the government side: 1. Please ask the Ministry to set up a special management agency to be in charge of printing, transportation, investigation, and fair pricing of textbooks. 2. Please ask the Ministry to complete the textbook editing work as soon as possible. 3. Please ask the Executive Yuan to allocate 5 million yuan for alleviating book shortages, to be centrally distributed by the Ministry. 4. Please ask the Ministry to unite with relevant agencies to improve the cultural transportation mechanism. 5. Please ask the Ministry to establish printing plants and assist provinces in expanding printing plants. 6. Please ask the Ministry and provinces to establish paper mills and conserve paper. 7. Please ask the Ministry to quickly establish measures for rewarding book merchants for donating textbook copyrights during the War of Resistance to meet urgent needs. 8. Assist book merchants in providing various conveniences. (B) On the school side: 1. Adopt public purchase and reuse methods and train students to cherish books. 2. Expand the textbook copying movement and adopt more material teaching. 3. Adopt the method of woodcut educational books. (C) On the book merchant side: 1. Set up branch printing plants in the interior. 2. Raising book prices should be approved by the government first. (2) It was decided that the Ministry should revise the curriculum standards for elementary schools, short-term elementary schools, and mass schools in order to adapt to the needs of national education. (3) It was decided that the equipment and teaching of existing elementary schools should be urgently enriched and improved. The main points are that each should formulate enrichment and improvement plans and steps according to financial and human resources, and the education administrative agencies at all levels below the department should divide the work to guide and supervise the schools in their implementation, and assess their performance and guide their improvement, with examples attached for reference. The above resolutions will not only allow the Ministry of Education to formulate a plan for the nationwide implementation of national education consolidation, but also allow the education administrative agencies of each province and city to formulate a plan for promoting national education in their respective provinces and cities, and assess their performance according to the plan. During the conference, the representatives of each province and city first drafted an outline for the implementation of national education, and after separate discussions, made a preliminary decision. After returning to their provinces, the representatives should draft concrete and detailed plans and send them to the Ministry for review.

National education is the most important work of spiritual mobilization in the process of resisting Japan and building the nation. The central government is determined to carry it out. Therefore, although the central government needs an annual subsidy of tens of millions of yuan, under the leadership of the President and Vice President Kong, it will definitely adopt it and find ways to raise funds as soon as possible. It is hoped that the authorities of each province and city and the personnel in charge of education administration will realize the central government's determination to promote the new county system and implement national education, invigorate their spirits, create undertakings, overcome all difficulties, and not avoid hardships, step up their work, and implement it effectively, so that the strength of the war of resistance can be increased, and the foundation of national construction can be laid.

### Charity Basketball Closes - Shangxing Wins Over Meitong, Shanghai Qing Wins Over Qianghua - Gu Liancheng Buys Ball for 150 Yuan

The last act of the grand charity basketball game sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, Qianghua's third match against Shanghai Qing, was held at the Central Qing Gymnasium last night, with the Shangxing vs. Meitong match as a prelude. The audience was even more enthusiastic than the previous two matches, which shows that people share the same heart in enjoying music and being charitable. The eye-opening performances were also quite a treat. As a result of the match, Shanghai Qing defeated Qianghua 45 to 32, and Shangxing defeated Meitong 21 to 19. Last night, only six members of the Shanghai Qing team arrived. When Sun Zhongpei and Wang Qiang were successively fouled out four times, there were no substitutes. In order to increase the audience's interest, Qianghua specially requested the referee to make an exception and allow Sun Huibei to re-enter the court. This spirit of benevolence and chivalry, performed in a charity match, is worthy of admiration. Last night, Chen Xianmo, director of general affairs of the Refugee Association, delivered a closing speech, and Miss Qianqian, granddaughter of Yu Qiaqing, presented the prizes. The game ball was auctioned off and purchased by Gu Liancheng, president of the Paramount Ballroom, for 150 yuan. The situation was as follows:

Main Force Battle

Following this was the match between Qianghua and Shanghai Qing, which unfolded the battle. Zude committed the first foul, and Nianhua was penalized but did not make it. Then Nianhua was penalized, and Xiangcheng made a throw and entered, and Shanghai Qing took the lead for the first time. Huibei then hit to take a lead of 3 to 0, and 5 to 2. Zhenzhong Shao...resulting in 6 to 5, Qianghua surpassed. Shanghai Qing replaced Chen Bangzhen with Wang Qiang, and Shanghai Qing took the lead again.

Lu committed two fouls, and Huibei made three out of four penalties, making the score 20 to 12, a difference of eight points. Huibei suddenly fouled out after four fouls, and Shanghai Qing immediately became a headless group, and Qianghua came from behind with 24 to 22. Shanghai Qing's misfortunes did not come singly, and Wang Qiang followed Huibei in being eliminated. Shanghai Qing lacked substitutes. According to the rules, they should continue to fight with four people, but it was a charity match, and the outcome was not important. Qiang specially requested the referee to allow Huibei to re-enter the game as an exception to increase the interest of the match. After Shanghai Qing regained Huibei's leadership, they became very active, and the score soared. As a result, Shanghai Qing won 45 to 32. Qianghua, though defeated, was still glorious.

Anglo-American Front Completed, Striving for External Development

Absorbing Russian and Jewish Voting Rights Proves Quite Effective; A Portion of German Residents Willing to Support Anglo-Americans

The election of the Shanghai Municipal Council is imminent. With as many as thirteen candidates competing for only nine seats, the situation is becoming increasingly tense. According to current estimates, the Japanese side can obtain approximately 3,700 votes, while the Anglo-American side also has about 3,500 votes. Both sides are evenly matched, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. However, the Japanese newspaper "Continental News" boldly proclaimed yesterday that they "already have secret strategies to ensure victory," displaying an aggressive and arrogant attitude. The Anglo-American side, concerned about their vital interests, is unwilling to be outdone and has formed a united front to launch a large-scale campaign to defeat the Japanese attempt. This election battle has already begun. As of yesterday, both sides seem to have increased their vote counts, as some taxpayers continue to pay taxes to the Municipal Council to obtain voting rights.

Anglo-American Steps are Completely Aligned

Although the Anglo-American Residents Election Committee does not currently have a strong organization for joint action, both election committees have adopted consistent steps for this election. Three days ago, the American Residents Election Committee notified each of its taxpayers to select seven candidates from the Anglo-American candidates. Yesterday, the British Residents Election Committee followed the American committee's approach and notified each taxpayer to select seven candidates designated by the committee. Therefore, the Anglo-American residents have, in fact, maintained their joint action. Both sides simultaneously requested taxpayers not to vote for candidates of other nationalities or for Reynolds and MacDonald to avoid splitting the votes.

Separate Activities, the Situation is Heated

The American Association and the American Women's Association were still working hard yesterday. Their goal is to ensure that 550 taxpayers participate in this election. The British side also launched a large-scale mobilization yesterday through the efforts of the association. The British Association has officially announced its desire to exert its utmost effort to secure five seats on the Municipal Council. In addition, (1) the Anglo-American side has dispatched personnel to the Jewish Refugee Relief Association and the Russian Residents Association to conduct vigorous voting campaigns, hoping to absorb some of their votes. (2) The Municipal Council has sent tax collectors, police officers, and Chinese constables to Yangshupu and Tangshan Road to investigate the names, ages, occupations, and tax payment situations of Jewish residents, and to investigate the residences and warehouses of Japanese residents to conduct a thorough review of taxpayer qualifications.

British Consul Urges Participation in Voting

George, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, notified all British resident taxpayers yesterday, urging them to pay close attention to the election on the 10th and 11th and the Western Taxpayers' Meeting on the 17th, stating, "Although I do not wish to influence the voting attitude of each taxpayer due to my subjective views, I believe that it is my duty to urge you to pay attention to this election and ensure your participation in voting. Furthermore, I hope that every taxpayer will attend this Western Taxpayers' Meeting, as important issues related to British individuals and British groups will be submitted for discussion at the meeting on the 17th."

Final Victory Lies in Self-Help

In addition to the taxpayers of the British, American, and Japanese residents, the number of taxpayers from other countries, according to investigations, is approximately as follows: French residents 100, Portuguese residents 92, Italian residents 64, Polish residents 49, Danish residents 38, Norwegian residents 25, Dutch residents 24, Czech residents 18, Latvian residents 15, Lithuanian residents 15, Spanish residents [whitespace] , Swiss residents 12, Finnish residents 2, others approximately 30. Among the residents of the above countries, approximately 280 can be expected to vote for the British, and 220 belong to the Japanese side. If half of the 700 German residents support the British and half support the Japanese, and the same goes for the 450 Russian residents, then the decision in this election may entirely depend on the German and Austrian refugees. The efforts of the Anglo-American and Japanese sides themselves are still an important factor.

Greek, Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish Residents Publicly Support Japan

It was learned yesterday from authoritative sources that approximately 180 Greek, Portuguese, and Italian resident taxpayers, and 12 Spanish residents, have been instructed by their consulates to unanimously vote for the Japanese candidates in the upcoming Municipal Council election. The reason for this is nothing more than an attempt to obtain more commercial benefits from the Japanese and puppet organizations.

There are Still Upright Individuals Among the Germans and Italians

According to reliable sources yesterday, most German residents will refuse to vote, as British trade policies have caused them to feel resentful. Another group of German residents who support the British, and Scandinavian residents, believe that although the Japanese occupation of the Northern District may offer considerable benefits to individual residents, they all express their support for the British and American candidates, believing that "from an overall perspective, the election of Anglo-American candidates will make the concession's status more favorable, while the Japanese may harbor other conspiracies behind their righteous words." Another Italian resident who supports the Japanese candidates stated yesterday that he does not believe the Japanese can invade the area south of Suzhou Creek, and that the Japanese will not take any military action in this election to demonstrate their power. Another Italian resident protested against the Japanese newspaper's threat that if the Japanese candidates are not elected, the Japanese army will take corresponding military action. He believes that this kind of threat has zero effect and is only enough to arouse "anti-Japanese" sentiment among foreigners, making them unfavorable to the Japanese. If the Japanese really have the intention of invading the concession, it will be difficult to realize.

The Authorities Adopt Appropriate Measures

The Municipal Council, fearing that this election will create an unprecedented record of tension, has prepared to take all appropriate measures in case of an emergency. It was learned that the Municipal Council officially stipulated yesterday that during the election, both sides of the Municipal Council building will be designated as parking areas for taxpayers (i.e., between Fuzhou Road, Henan Road, and Jiangxi Road, and between Jiangxi Road, Fuzhou Road, and Hankou Road).

Candidates Express Their Political Views

British candidate Roderick MacDonald stated to all British and American resident taxpayers yesterday that the Municipal Council is currently actively engaged in controlling Shanghai's commodity prices and taxes in order to reduce public hardship. Therefore, he strongly supports the Municipal Council's plan to issue municipal lottery tickets. MacDonald's remarks stated that the Municipal Council announced an increase in municipal taxes, and the Japanese attempted to control the concession, which made this election tense. The Municipal Council's budget for this year has been criticized by various parties, but in fact, the Bureau has tried various methods to save money. The main reason for the sudden increase in the budget is obviously the depreciation of the local currency and the rise in the cost of living, which the Municipal Council cannot do anything about. I have served in the Municipal Council for three years and deeply admire the work of various departments. I strongly support the issuance of municipal lottery tickets by the Municipal Council to supplement some of the funds, as this will greatly help the Municipal Council's finances. If I am elected this time, I will do my best to solve the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries. If the "bad land" is not cleared, the "police agreement" signed between the Municipal Council and the puppet side will be difficult to implement. The Municipal Council's police authority in Hongkou should also be restored to obtain economic assistance from the north of the bridge. When taxpayers vote, they should support the Anglo-American candidates and show great interest in the Municipal Council's affairs. American candidate Powell and American candidate Alcott also expressed their opinions on the administrative issues of the Municipal Council yesterday. They also believe that the financial difficulties of the Municipal Council are due to the depreciation of the local currency. Mr. Alcott further believes that the Municipal Council should adopt various commercial techniques, and taxes must be reduced, but it is also a fact that a complete institution requires a large amount of funding. Therefore, they expressed their support for the issuance of municipal lottery tickets. Powell believes that the current tax base is too narrow. He has the same opinion as MacDonald on the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries.

### Japanese Embassy Spokesperson Speaks Eloquently

Hidden Meaning Lies in Restraining the British

The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese Embassy spokesperson yesterday (5th) spoke at a press conference regarding the Japanese side's nomination of five Japanese directors for the Municipal Council, claiming that "Shanghai's Japanese residents have no intention of following the old habits of previous elections, seeking to permanently occupy a majority of seats on the board, so as to repeat the current 'monopoly system of a certain country's residents.' If possible, the Japanese residents intend to give a seat on the board to a minority ethnic group within the Public Concession in the future, but at present, the Japanese residents should try to break the monopoly of a certain country's residents."

Boasting About Numbers, with Special Reasons

After the Japanese side nominated five candidates, there were various discussions from the outside world. It should be known that there are more Japanese taxpayers in the Public Concession than British taxpayers. However, although the British residents have fewer people, they have nominated five candidates. Therefore, it is only natural for the Japanese to nominate five candidates.

Property Standards Claimed to be in the Past

The Japanese are now planning to use legal means to reform the administration of the Public Concession to keep pace with the times. Therefore, they have nominated five candidates. Some British residents say that the British interests in the Public Concession are greater. It should be known that the era of elections based on property standards is over. Today, individuals must be recognized regardless of property.

History of the Concession Not Denied

As for the common political program of the Japanese candidates, it is to reform the administration of the Public Concession on a more international basis. It is undeniable that the British created this concession, and later the American Concession was merged to form the Public Concession. However, this was a hundred years ago, and the situation has changed since then. Today, only by sending directors according to the proportion of residents can the future prosperity of the Public Concession be achieved. This is also what the Japanese candidates are seeking.

The Current Situation of the Bureau is Decried

Almost no one in Shanghai admits that the administration and finances of the Municipal Council are flawless. Therefore, the Japanese residents feel that reforms must be made. Since the current situation is full of flaws, it cannot be maintained. Or perhaps after the five Japanese directors are elected, they will completely destroy the administration of the Municipal Council. These fears have no basis.

Gentleman's Agreement Not Noticed At All

As for the "gentleman's agreement," it never existed. In 1926, although the Japanese nominated three director candidates, they had to be re-elected, which shows that there was no "gentleman's agreement," nor was there a proper way to reach a ratio of 5-2-2. When asked what attitude the Japanese would take if the five Japanese candidates were not fully elected, the spokesperson replied that since the Japanese's purpose is to reform, they should abide by the election results.

### Associations in the Occupied Areas Urge Family Members of the Deceased to Claim Coffins for Burial

Threatened by the Japanese with Forced Removal, Cremation Will Be Performed After the Deadline

Most of the provincial and county associations in this city are located in the occupied areas. The number of coffins of fellow provincials and county residents from Shanghai stored in these associations is very large. Because the Japanese side wants to "revive" the market, they have uniformly limited each association to quickly move the stored coffins for burial by the end of this month. Those that exceed the deadline will be cremated. Therefore, each provincial and county association has issued an urgent notice, urging the family members of the deceased to claim the coffins for burial before the deadline, and not to delay.

### Three British Community Leaders Issue Open Letters Explaining the Reasons for the Municipal Council's Tax Increase and Urging Foreign Residents to Participate in the Board Election

According to the North China Daily News, Marshall, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, Woodhead, Chairman of the China Association, and Arnold, Chairman of the British Residents Association, recently jointly issued a public letter to the taxpayers of various countries in Shanghai, explaining the reasons for the Municipal Council's tax increase and matters relating to this year's Board election. The letter begins by stating that the Municipal Council intends to increase the tax from 18% to 27%.

The Important Reason Lies in the Fact That the Municipal Council's Income Has Been Insufficient for Many Years. To remedy this, the Municipal Council established an Economy Committee in 1929 and a Salary Adjustment Committee in 1929. The suggestions made were of no help. The Municipal Council then sold the electrical plant, paid off the debts, and had a surplus of 40 million yuan to balance the budget. At the same time, it implemented a policy of emphasizing education, with expenses reaching more than 3 million yuan per year. The income obtained by the Municipal Council in accordance with the Yangjingbang Land Regulations is limited, only enough to cover ordinary

Administrative Expenses, the cost of education, which is more than 3 million yuan per year, and the cost of maintaining prisons, which is more than 3.5 million yuan per year, were not initially included. The proposed tax increase of 9% will account for 70%. Therefore, unless the prisons are closed and the prisoners are handed over to the Chinese authorities, and each school is handed over to people of various countries in the public [area] for self-management, thereby saving maintenance costs, then

The Tax Increase is Inevitable. If the music team is abolished, the Wanguo [International] Orchestra is reduced, the Wanguo [International] Merchant Corps is reduced, and the White Russian soldiers hired by the corps are dismissed, the savings are relatively small and insufficient to compensate. The letter finally appealed to foreign residents to participate in the election of the Municipal Council directors, saying that when the Public Concession was established, the interests of the British were greatest, so the city administration must emulate the British system, and the police department and the Wanguo [International] Merchant Corps were also established in accordance with British methods. This system has been in place for a long time and has been

Effective. Any drastic changes to the current system are both impractical and not in the interest of the entire concession. In recent years, people from various countries have entered the Public Concession to enjoy protection, but this must not affect the balance of the Municipal Council's current system. We have some suggestions for the Municipal Council that we cannot agree with, but at this time we must abandon our prejudices and unanimously support the Municipal Council. Therefore, we ask all members and foreign residents to participate in the voting and attend the taxpayers' meeting to jointly maintain the current system.

### French Municipal Council Increases Police Special Taxes

The French Concession Municipal Council has increased special taxes for the police department, which are recorded as follows: (1) Watchman patrol fee: For Yue constables guarding day and night, 250 yuan per month per person; for Yue constables guarding for four hours, 45 yuan per month per person; for Chinese constables guarding day and night, 200 yuan per month per person; for Chinese constables guarding for four hours, 35 yuan per month per person. (2) Patrol watchman diligence fee: 10 yuan per quarter per constable. Watchman patrol employment card book: 1 yuan and 3 jiao per book. (3) Rent and repair military tax: 15 yuan and 6 jiao per quarter. (4) Military license tax: Private military license fee, 20 yuan per six months per license; bodyguard military license fee, 40 yuan per six months per license. (5) Military equipment storage tax: 5 yuan per year. (6) Fire control permit: 2 yuan for each change of certificate. (Ag) Insurance vest tax: Input or manufacture insurance vest tax, 700 yuan per year; sell insurance vest tax, 252 yuan per year; guard insurance vest tax, 4 yuan and 2 jiao per year. (8) Inspection and transit permit fees for exporting grains and flour: (A) Flour 5 fen per bag (21 kilograms); rice 1 jiao per bag (80 kilograms).

### Kunming Postal Packages Will Be Accepted Next Tuesday

The Shanghai Postal Administration suspended accepting parcels from Shanghai to Kunming when the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was bombed. It was briefly restored last week, but those who wanted to send parcels were extremely enthusiastic, and the number exceeded 10,000 in a few days. Due to the limited storage space, the acceptance was suspended again. The parcel group of the bureau stated that the above-mentioned received parcels have been shipped out one after another. Therefore, it is scheduled to resume accepting Kunming parcels starting next week. However, due to the limited storage space, the acceptance will be suspended again if the number is too large. In addition, all parcels to be sent must be registered in advance.

### Japanese Side Obstructs American Radio Broadcasting, with Subtle Implications for the Election Campaign; American Consulate Has Protested to the Japanese Side

The XHMA radio station, operated by American businessman L.E. Healey in this city, broadcasts news daily by Carroll D. Alcott according to the station's scheduled time. However, starting yesterday morning, its radio waves were suddenly disrupted, and the disruption continued throughout the day, causing thousands of listeners to be unable to receive the news. Many people went to the station to complain and inquire. It is reported that after an investigation by the station, this

Disruptive Waves Were Actually Coming From the Japanese Side in Hongkou. Healey and others asked American Vice-Consul Bottlerick to lodge a protest with the Japanese side so that the station's news broadcasting could continue. Mr. Bottlerick notified the Japanese Consul of this matter yesterday afternoon. The Japanese side is also investigating, but as of last night, nothing has been found. It is also reported that Mr. Alcott stated to the press yesterday that the disruptive radio waves came from the area of Zhapu Road and North Suzhou Road in Hongkou. He had discovered the signs of disruption four days before, and the momentum was very fierce, mostly occurring when he

Broadcast the News. It is particularly strange that these radio waves started disrupting his broadcasts when he publicly supported five British and two American candidates for the Municipal Council.

### New Subsidiary Coins Released From the Factory

Five Million Eight Hundred Thousand One-Fen Coins; Seven Million Two Hundred Thousand Two-Fen Coins

In view of the fact that subsidiary coins are the medium for small transactions and the people have a great need for them, and in order to maintain the circulation of subsidiary coins and prevent people from coveting illegal profits, the Ministry of Finance has revised the Subsidiary Coin Regulations to adjust the fineness and weight of various subsidiary coins to facilitate circulation. It has ordered the Central Mint to mint new one-fen, two-fen, five-fen, and ten-fen subsidiary coins. They have now been rushed to be minted by four sub-factories in Chengdu, Kunming, Guilin, and Lanzhou. They have been inspected and approved by the Review Committee to leave the factory and be issued by the Central Bank. The number of coins is 5.8 million one-fen coins and 7.2 million two-fen coins. The style is the same as the nickel coins that are already in circulation. They are easy to carry, and the people are happy to use them. The problem of the difficulty of trading and finding change that has been prevalent in various places for a long time has been solved.

### Rice Prices Trended Downward in March, the Cost of Living Index Gradually Decreased

Arrival of Saigon Rice Slightly Eased Food Supply; Cotton Yarn Soared, Clothing Prices Rose Across the Board

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai City Workers' Cost of Living Index and Retail Prices for March 1940 were announced. In this month, the exchange rate plummeted, and the prices of clothing, fuel, and miscellaneous items also rose repeatedly. However, due to the decline in rice prices and the cheap prices of fish, meat, vegetables, and other items, the overall index decreased. The overall index for this month was 368.08, which was 9.84 points lower than 377.92 in February, a decrease of 2.6%. Among the classified indices, only food decreased by 7.34%. This category has the most consumption, and the impact on the index is also the most significant. The overall index therefore decreased accordingly. The clothing index rose by 9.36% compared with the previous month, the fuel index rose by 9.49%, and the miscellaneous items index rose by 8.03%. The purchasing power of currency rose slightly accordingly. This month, one legal tender yuan was equivalent to 2 jiao, 7 fen, 1 li, and 7 hao in 1936.

Food Prices Fell

This month, Saigon rice arrived in abundance, and prices trended downward. The rice problem was slightly eased. In the second half of the month, the selling price of No. 2 japonica rice and Saigon rice was below 40 yuan per picul. Prices rose again at the end of the month. On average, japonica rice was 6.67% lower than the previous month, and Saigon rice was 8.55% lower. Pork, lard, fish, duck eggs, chicken, and soybean oil also fell. Under the vegetable category, vegetables such as cabbage, radishes, chives, and spinach fell sharply due to seasonal factors.

Fuel Prices Rose

Cotton yarn soared, and the prices of clothing and other items rose across the board. Starting from the 22nd of this month, the selling price of coal briquettes rose to 6 yuan and 6 jiao per dan. Firewood rose the most sharply, an increase of 29.52% compared with the previous month. Matches rose by 13.41%. Among the fuel category, only charcoal had a lower selling price than the previous month. Among the miscellaneous items category, straw paper, wine, and soap also rose.

### Continuing the Deliberation of Stabilized Rice Sales

The three instances of stabilized rice sales incurred a total loss of approximately 800,000 yuan. The method for continuing stabilized rice sales will be discussed again at a later date.

The Shanghai Stabilized Rice Sales Committee convened a plenary meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. Over fifty people attended, including Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Nianxuan, Xu Xiaochu, Jiang Yiping, and Cai Renmin. Yu Qiaqing presided over the meeting.

Reported Items

(1) Advances for the period of stabilized rice sales: Purchasing Saigon broken rice, whether spot or on order, required upfront payment in full. However, the committee only received rice payments through daily retail sales, making turnover difficult. Besides offsetting with donations, the shortfall was significant, with standing committee members responsible for borrowing and advancing funds, reaching nearly one million yuan. (2) Donation amount: From the start of operations to April 4th, the committee received directly and designated banks and money houses to collect donations from various sectors, totaling 768,826.93 yuan. (3) Quantity of rice purchased and its amount: From the start of operations to April 4th, 111,012 bags of rice were purchased, totaling 4,300,041.24 yuan in legal tender. The price ranged from 34.40 yuan to 43.09 yuan per bag. (4) Quantity of rice sold and its consideration in the first phase: From January 21st to February 5th, a total of 16 days, 34,070 bags of rice were sold, receiving a total consideration of 1,005,874 yuan. (5) Quantity of rice sold and its consideration in the second phase: From February 23rd to March 13th, a total of 20 days, 39,400 bags of rice were sold, receiving a total consideration of 1,338,431 yuan. (6) Quantity of rice sold and its consideration in the third phase: From March 19th to April 3rd (originally scheduled to April 7th), 20,450 bags of rice were sold, receiving a consideration of 661,201 yuan. (7) Committee's administrative expenses: The administrative budget approved by the first standing committee meeting was 1,400 yuan per month, initially funded by 100 yuan donations from each of the fourteen standing committee members. From the start of operations to the end of February, a total of 2,415.28 yuan was spent, with advertising being the largest expenditure. Standing committee members and the chief secretary all served on a voluntary basis, without receiving salaries or allowances. (8) Estimated loss of the committee's stabilized rice sales: The first phase resulted in a loss of 243,813.60 yuan, the second phase in a loss of 245,460.82 yuan, and the third phase, including approximately 16,500 bags of rice remaining, is estimated to result in a loss of 305,541.20 yuan, totaling a loss of 794,815.72 yuan.

Resolved Matters

(1) The entire committee passed a resolution to continue stabilized rice sales. (2) Lin Kanghou, Qin Runqing, Xu Guanqun, Chen Zixin, Xi Shaosun, Ding Houqing, and Sheng Xiqi were added as standing committee members, bringing the total to twenty-one, including the previous fourteen. (3) A standing committee meeting was scheduled for April 13th (Saturday) to discuss various methods for continuing the operations. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM.

### Rumors of US Flagship Grounding Denied by Admiral Hepburn; Report from Japanese News Agency Inaccurate; Cruise in Chinese Waters Postponed

The flagship Augusta (9,050 tons) of the US Asiatic Fleet, currently stationed in Manila, had its cruise postponed. However, a news dispatch from the Domei News Agency in Hong Kong, dated the 5th, stated that the Augusta ran aground off the coast of the Philippines while participating in exercises with the US Pacific Fleet, and the hull was damaged and entered dry dock for repairs. Yesterday (the 6th), a Reuters dispatch from Washington stated that this claim was confirmed by the US Navy Department, and that the flagship Augusta was damaged ten days ago at a location south of the Philippines. However, yesterday (the 6th), an Associated Press dispatch from Manila stated that Admiral Hepburn, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, had denied this claim, stating that the reports were inaccurate.

### Mitsui Employee Yu Yushan's Divorce Lawsuit; A Diamond Ring Sparks a Lovers' Quarrel; Mediation Fails as the Inside Story Remains Unclear

Xie Lianping, a 21-year-old girl from Anhui, currently resides at No. 5 Kangcun, Pingjili Road. Previously, she lived at No. 22 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, while studying. Her father currently serves as the magistrate of Anxi County in Northwest Gansu Province. The girl and her mother remained in Shanghai because they were not accustomed to the climate and environment of the Northwest. In the winter of last year, through an introduction by a friend, she met Yu Yushan, a 24-year-old local Shanghai resident who works as a junior employee at Mitsui & Co., residing at No. 52 Yongqing Lane, Xindagu Road. The two fell deeply in love, and their affection reached a fever pitch.

Seduction and Loss of Virginity

Xie was seduced by Yu into the Yangtze Hotel, where she lost her virginity. After her mother discovered this, she made a complaint. Both parties enlisted Ding Baoshu and Hu Bokang as matchmakers. On February 21st of last year, they held an engagement ceremony at the Xindu Restaurant in the New World Department Store, and a formal wedding ceremony was scheduled for the 27th of this month. The girl's family was in the midst of preparing for the wedding.

Diamond Ring Dispute

Unexpectedly, Yu Yushan suddenly claimed that Xie had stolen someone else's diamond ring and was detained by the police, causing her to suffer a blow to her reputation. Citing this as a matter of honor, he hired lawyer Tu Kunfan to file a petition with the Second Special Court's Civil Division to dissolve the engagement. The court held a hearing for mediation, but Xie had moved from Beile Road to Pingjili Road, and the summons could not be delivered.

Continued Mediation

The petitioner requested a postponement to deliver the summons to the girl's new address, which was approved. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao Yuan presided over the fourth civil court to continue mediation. The petitioner was represented by his lawyer, who stated the reasons for the petition. The respondent, Xie Lianping, was represented by lawyer Li Pengcheng, who opposed the dissolution of the engagement and stated that since the petitioner had filed for dissolution,

Respondent's Counterclaim

He had also committed criminal acts of disrupting the family and violating public morals, and the respondent would also pursue legal action accordingly. After deliberation, the court declared the mediation unsuccessful.

### The French Concession Public Works Department Schedules the Killing of Stray Dogs

It is reported that the Public Works Department will begin tomorrow to kill unlicensed stray dogs within the eastern district in order to ensure the safety of travelers and public hygiene.

### Electricity Company Hosts Press Conference to Explain New Surcharge; Coal Price Hike Forces Company to Act

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Electric Power Company, represented by its foreign deputy manager, Mr. Fogelie, and Mr. Wang Jingrong of the Customer Engineering Department, hosted a press conference at the New Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road to explain the second increase in surcharges for ordinary electricity, electric heating, electric cooking, and electric water heating. According to Mr. Fogelie, the company was compelled to increase the surcharges due to difficult circumstances. Because few ordinary people use these services, the company did not increase the price of ordinary electricity for lighting, as it did not want to increase the burden on the general public. Electricity is a public utility. The basic rates for the four types of electricity mentioned above are 4.5 cents per unit for ordinary electricity, 4 cents for electric heating, 3 cents for electric cooking, and 2 cents for electric water heating. In April, due to the foreign exchange shortage, the company's costs increased and its revenue fell short. Therefore, the company increased electricity prices for lighting by 138%.

Soaring Coal Prices Cause Significant Losses

The increase in electricity prices can be considered a coal price surcharge. The company uses over 60,000 tons of coal per month. The Kailuan Coal Mine only supplies 25,000 tons per month. The Kailuan Coal Mine Company used to be able to ship 100,000 tons per week, but there has been no detailed report recently. The remainder is purchased from India because Indian coal is cheaper. However, even at current Indian coal prices, the price has only increased by 20% in two years, while transportation costs have increased fivefold. The price is still calculated in shillings. The company's coal consumption budget for this year, from March to December, has exceeded 74 million national currency, more than 7.4 million national currency per month. In other words, the cost of coal for one month is now approximately equal to the cost of coal for one year. The surcharge approved in 1938 only compensated the company for losses due to foreign exchange shortages in its operations and maintenance expenses. It did not account for losses due to rising prices. The cost of Indian coal in July 1939 was 38 national currency per ton. In April 1940, it was 130 national currency. In July of the same year, it was 167 national currency (based on the current exchange rate). The Public Works Department approved the company's surcharge, which will be implemented on May 7th. The standard coal price is set at 70 national currency per ton. If the price falls to 70 national currency, or US dollars to 6.25 yuan, the surcharge will be canceled. If the foreign exchange rate for shillings remains at the current price when the increase is implemented, the prices for the four electrical services mentioned above will increase by approximately 70% to 75%. The company's monthly expenses used to be 40% for coal, but now it is 80%. Other expenses account for only 20%. Therefore, there is no way to reduce costs further.

Company's Cash Reserves Greatly Reduced

Regarding stocks, domestic Chinese holders include (1) approximately 2,000 bondholders, each holding bonds worth approximately 44,000 national currency. Excluding large holders, there are approximately 18 million national currency in bonds, with each holder holding less than 9,000 national currency. (2) There are approximately 6,800 preferred shareholders, with each household holding an average of approximately 4,200 national currency. However, the majority of the shares are still controlled by the United States. Since the August 13th Incident, the company has automatically borne the increased costs. This expense is considerable. As of June 1938, the company's cash reserves have been greatly reduced. The company has never paid interest on ordinary shares. Regarding the 6.68 million national currency in preferred shares held by Shanghai bondholders and preferred shareholders, interest has not been paid since March 31, 1938. This unpaid interest totals 12 million national currency. The above investment statistics are used to indicate the company's obligations and are not related to the surcharge currently under discussion. This obligation is the reason why the company cannot supply electricity at cost.

### Guo Xiukai Accused of Sending Threatening Letters; Police Withdraw Lawsuit; Implicated in the Lao Feng Xiang Share Withdrawal Case

Lao Feng Xiang Silver Shop on Nanjing Road was jointly established by Guo Yutang, Xu Busun, Fei Zubang, Fei Changnian, and others, for a long time. Fei Zushou served as the manager, and Fei Changnian was the assistant manager. The business was very prosperous. In January of last year, Guo Yutang had no intention of continuing the partnership and intended to withdraw his shares. At the time, because of

Disagreement on Withdrawal Amount

Miscalculations, Guo appointed an accountant to audit the accounts, suspecting that the managers had committed fraud. Guo's son, Xiukai, strongly advocated for a thorough investigation.

Suspected Motives

Related to the accounting audit. The police filed a lawsuit with the Special Court, awaiting a rescheduled hearing. Guo Xiukai's lawyer, Zhou Fangxi, argued that the defendant had legal rights over Lao Feng Xiang Silver Shop. If there were any disputes, he could seek remedies through legal means, without resorting to the most foolish method of sending threatening letters. Therefore, it was

Clear Slander

This case was heard by Judge Xiao Xie-fen yesterday morning. The police requested to withdraw the lawsuit, and Judge Xiao approved the withdrawal, ending the dispute.

Du Shaoru, a wealthy merchant from Chongming who lives at 408 Judar Road and owns the Fu'an Yarn Factory, was visited on December 23rd of last year at 10:00 AM by Qiu Haitao from Nantong, who claimed to be a Hua detective inspector from the Five Continents Detective Agency at 367 Jiangxi Road, leading gang members Wang Qi'an, Gao Wenbin, Ling Zhenchang, Qian Yongchang, and others.

### Letter

To the esteemed editors: I am writing in response to a news item published in your esteemed newspaper on the 5th regarding the demand by drivers from the four taxi companies in this city, Xiang Sheng, Tailai, Yunfei, and Yinse, for an increase in refreshment allowance. The article stated that "the negotiations ultimately failed due to the insistence of the Tailai Company management on not increasing the allowance," which is clearly not in accordance with the facts. The decision not to increase the refreshment allowance was a joint decision of the four companies mentioned above, and our company cannot be held solely responsible. We hope you will investigate and correct this matter accordingly. Sincerely, Tailai Motor Company Limited, April 6, 1940.

### Finance: Few Buyers are Actively Trading Foreign Exchange

The foreign exchange market was uneventful yesterday. The HSBC listed rates remained unchanged. The black market for British and US dollars was even more tranquil, with trading becoming mechanical and lacking vitality. There was no news to excite the market, and most former players seemed to be in a period of rest. The market opened flat and dull in the morning. Later, with the intention of making a purchase, American banks and the favorable foreign banks also sold, resulting in a slightly looser market in the midst of stability. Speculators then stepped in to absorb, but other Chinese banks offered funds, more than offsetting the purchases. Therefore, the market did not change much and remained stable until the close. The US dollar was slightly lower by 0.03125 from the previous close, at 6.15625 yuan. The British gold remained unchanged at 4 shillings 1/25 (equivalent to 3.581875 yuan for the US dollar exchange rate). Futures were also slightly firmer, with the potential trend similar to the spot market.

The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4 shillings 1/125 for British gold and 6.125 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged from the previous close. At the same time, futures also opened flat. After the opening, American banks and favorable foreign banks began to sell, and the market became firmer. It is estimated that American banks sold US dollars for delivery in the current month at 6.0625 yuan to foreign banks, and favorable foreign banks sold US dollars for delivery in the current month at 6.0625 yuan to a certain Chinese bank. At that time, the spot US dollar could be settled at 6.15625 yuan. The HSBC listed rates were revealed to be unchanged, and the white silver balancing tax was revealed to be up by 0.025. Although speculators absorbed, Chinese banks frequently supplied, and funds ultimately felt abundant. It is estimated that speculators purchased US dollars for delivery in the current month at 6.0625 yuan and US dollars for delivery in May at 5.90625 yuan from Chinese banks. Soon, the market closed. The spot US dollar was 6.15625 yuan, the British gold remained at 4 shillings 1/125, the US dollar for delivery in the current month was 6.0625 yuan, the British gold was 4 shillings 0.0625, the US dollar for delivery in May was 5.90625 yuan, and the shilling was 3 shillings 9.96875.

### Cash Supply and Demand: The Few Cannot Defeat the Many

The black market for cash bullion (烚赤) yesterday did not change much, and the trend remained weak. As a result, it continued to decrease slightly by 28 yuan. This was because the foreign exchange market was slightly looser, which had a slight impact on sentiment. Also, today was the weekend, so there were naturally fewer buyers, making it easy for prices to fall and difficult to rise. It opened 33 yuan lower, at 5,420 yuan. Soon after, the first to purchase were gold shops, so it rose back to 5,435 yuan. However, it still could not hold on. Although other firms continued to buy, there were many sellers, including silver shops and retail investors. Therefore, the few could not defeat the many, and the price fell to the day's low of 5,400 yuan. Later, thanks to a certain money exchange firm absorbing a considerable amount, plus securities firms tracking and buying, it returned to a high of 5,430 yuan. It closed at 5,425 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, and trading was rare outside the market as well. Half a day's trading volume was mostly retail, with few bulk transactions, about 1,500 taels or so. Silver shop jewelry was down by 5 yuan, and customs gold remained flat.

A Wave of Selling for Bullion Cash

Since the initial opening for each bar (ten taels) in the morning, sentiment was weak, and there was a wave of selling. The market opened 33 yuan lower. The money exchange firm sold 20 taels to the silver shop at 5,420 yuan. Shortly after, the silver shop and gold shop mutually bought in, recovering 15 yuan. The gold shop bought 10 taels from the silver shop at 5,435 yuan. However, at that time, US dollar spot and forward rates were reported to be firm, and selling resumed. The money exchange firm and silver shop helped to push down the price. The gold shop sold 10 taels to the money exchange firm at 5,408 yuan. Afterwards, relying on the gold shop helping to absorb, it recovered 18 yuan. The gold shop bought 30 taels from the silver shop at 5,426 yuan. After this, buyers stopped, and the silver shop sold again. Adding to this, the silver shop also sold a little, and funds were extremely tight. The price fell 26 yuan again. The silver shop sold 10 taels to the money exchange firm, at the day's low of 5,400 yuan. After 11:00 AM, securities firms bought cheaply, and a certain money exchange firm increased its purchases, seeing a recovery of 30 yuan. The securities firm bought 20 taels from the gold shop at 5,430 yuan. Then, the gold shop sold 10 taels to the securities firm, at 5,425 yuan, as the closing price for the afternoon. As a result, it was 28 yuan lower than the previous day. It has fallen for five consecutive days, totaling 130 yuan. Half a day's trading was 35 yuan, effectively. The selling price of cash gold in the gold shop was a few yuan higher than the bullion cash, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was mostly inactive, more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold.

Jewelry Gold Followed Down by 5 Yuan

Initially, jewelry gold for silver shops was suspended at 550 yuan by Datong Bank. When it came to 11 o'clock, it was lowered by 5 yuan. At this point, Datong Bank changed its suspension to 545 yuan, the same as the industry price, buying back at 5 yuan or so.

### Weak Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market trend remained soft. The British and US gold pounds continued to decline in price throughout the day under the pressure of selling. The US pound has already retreated into the 130 yuan range. The supply and demand for British gold notes was still balanced, and the market price stabilized. The initial selling pressure for US dollar notes was strong, once retreating to 16.14 yuan. Then, it suddenly turned into a rising trend, reaching as high as 16.20 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, it suddenly turned downward again, falling to 16.17 yuan in the evening market. Singapore notes were slightly supplied, and the market price was weak and sluggish. The supply and demand for Hong Kong notes and French francs and Annam notes were balanced, and the market price changed little. Dutch notes were slightly in demand, and the market price rose. Japanese gold notes were initially stable, but in the afternoon, the supply suddenly became tight, and the market price gradually fell, fluctuating to 1.307 yuan in the evening market. There were still no shortage of buyers for Korean notes, and the market price continued to rise, at 1.09 yuan in the evening market. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: British and US gold pounds each fell by 1 yuan, US dollar notes fell by 0.03 yuan, Singapore notes fell by 0.10 yuan, and only Dutch notes rose by 0.10 yuan. All others remained unchanged.

### Discount Lowered Again by Two Yuan; Interbank Loan Rate Also Slightly Down by Three Points

The interbank loan rate of the Money Trade Association also continued to be slightly lower by three points, quoted at 0.8% in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Grain: Sources Can Be Opened, Rice Prices Steadily Declining; Jiangbei Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Wuhu Also to Lift Ban

The rice market showed a soft trend again, with prices of all goods falling by half a yuan to nearly one yuan. Following the market's return to weakness, rumors spread that domestic rice from the interior would soon be open and freely traded as usual. Also, the Rice Merchants Association proposed that the authorities thoroughly investigate warehouse stocks and set a deadline for sales, and that certain parties planned to organize rice cooperatives. Many felt these ideas were impractical and feared a resurgence of volatility, so buyers adopted a cautious approach, taking steady steps. Speculative merchants were selling high and buying low, while shops remained idle except for essential needs. Interior clients had stopped buying, and original merchants and vendors, facing adverse market conditions, were eager to sell off their stock, even at a loss. However, sales were relatively good in the morning as some actual buyers anticipated the regular Sunday holiday. But as soon as extra transactions were added, the market softened again. As a result, prices were generally lower. The closing price for No. 1 Saigon rice was 42.80 yuan to 42.50 yuan. Prices for No. 1 rice, Siam rice, fire-milled rice, and pointed rice are detailed in the market price section.

Although the price of glutinous rice has repeatedly fallen, it is approaching the level of broken rice. It is known that when goods are cheap, sales become sluggish, especially with the shadow of foreign rice looming, causing prices to continue to decline by half a yuan. The reason for the decline is that sources are open. Glutinous rice is a supplementary product and occupies a secondary position, so even though certain areas have banned transportation, glutinous rice is an exception.

Regarding thick and thin japonica rice and early and late indica rice, after the sharp rise in rice prices last year, followed by the strict price control at 40 yuan, foreign rice, which was not subject to restrictions, continued to rise daily. As a result, domestic rice became scarce due to transportation difficulties and the endless increase in taxes and levies in certain areas. Normal trading transformed into off-market transactions, giving the impression that there was supply but no market for domestic rice. This situation has persisted for several months. During the recent sharp drop in prices, the market briefly saw early and late indica rice from Nangang trading at 37-38 yuan, but then prices returned to their previous levels. Yesterday, early Nangang rice was again on the market and sold as limited, with each dan (unit of dry measure) selling for 40 yuan. There were no other sightings. It was reported that off-market transactions included Wuxi high-grade japonica rice at 45 yuan, Su-Kun japonica rice at 43 yuan, and particularly thin indica rice at 44.50 yuan to 44 yuan, with medium rice at 42-43 yuan, a decrease of 40 to 50 cents compared to previous prices. Large quantities continued to be transferred from Hongkou, with another 2,000 to 3,000 bags.

Jiangbei indica rice has long been absent. Yesterday, off-market transactions also occurred, trading at 40.05 yuan to 39.50 yuan, reportedly for newly arrived goods totaling over 1,000 bags. It is also rumored that rice from Jingzhou and Wuhu will soon be released. If this can be realized, it would be a blessing for the people's food supply.

It is said that 10,000 bags of soft and weak powdered japonica rice from a certain military area are being exclusively sold by Dachang Company in Hongkou. Although it is said that the company was founded by a Chinese merchant surnamed Yu, it is actually backed by a certain entity. Today (7th) is a regular holiday and the company is closed for the day.

Foreign rice was imported again yesterday, with 4,667 bags arriving from Siam on the Taikoo Company's Ka Ying vessel and 1,260 bags from Hong Kong. The vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and unloading has been completed. (Zu)

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Recover Slightly; Three Oak Companies Distribute Dividends

The informal securities market saw a slight recovery yesterday, but it was limited. The market sentiment remained firm, with Class C shares approaching the squeeze point. There was a sense of unexpected hope, resulting in a lack of spot goods on the market. However, excessive crowding and speculation caused some to sell at high prices. Although the market price recovered only slightly, another level was broken, and the future may see a period of consolidation. Yesterday's situation was stable amidst weakness. In the morning, buyers and sellers were evenly matched, and although trading was active, buyers were able to maintain support, so prices fluctuated with limited ranges. In the afternoon, many bulls came out, but absorption was also strong. Tongkang consistently bought, Yongkang consistently sold, Lianyi Dingkang bought first and then sold, Shen Da sold first and then bought, Lianhe and Gongmao stopped after slight buying, and Xinfu and Shuntai made small purchases. The market is temporarily consolidating and will soon change. The market price ultimately decreased slightly, by 0.10 to 0.25 yuan, with a total turnover of approximately 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading saw 100 shares traded on the exchange, with a price of 29.25 yuan.

### Yarn & Cotton: April Futures Prices Settle Mutually

The yarn market continued to weaken with a slightly stronger downward trend. This was due to substantial gains in recent days, prompting profit-taking by long positions, which loosened the market. However, factory inventories were dwindling, and spot supply was tight, so the underlying fundamentals remained solid. But raw cotton was weak, diverging from the yarn market, which was due to differences in supply and demand. The lowest price for April futures was 1,110 yuan, closing at 1,132 yuan.

The spot yarn market opened weaker in the morning, as shorts had suffered too heavily. Some, given the situation, had no intention of further shorting. Market conditions were flat, and most April futures trades settled at mutual prices, softening the market. The current premium for 20-count Double Horse yarn fell directly from 1,140 yuan to 1,105 yuan, then recovered to 1,119 yuan. Trade volume for half a day totaled 1,210 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse spot yarn fell by 30 yuan. 30 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin on the 7th, 3,450 pieces to Hong Kong, 550 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 35 pieces to Haikou, and 475 pieces to Haiphong. The breakdown of purchases by various regions is as follows:

Yunnan: 20-count, same trade: 790

Hong Kong: 300, Wenzhou: 30

Ningbo: 10, Total: 1,210

### Indian Cotton Futures: Continued Trading

Indian cotton trading showed a slight improvement. Factory purchases of Indian cotton from Sino-Foreign were substantial, for May delivery. The rest of the trading was mostly between firms. The market was stable, with little change from the previous day. The current cotton situation is as follows:

San Yu Hua: 210.00, Same trade purchase: 100 bales

Weng Mo La: 215.00, Xin Yu purchase: 100 pieces

West India: 220.00, Shen Xin purchase: 100 pieces

Mi Te Lin: 26.00, Again: 100 pieces

Tongzhou Hua: 105.50, Again: 1,600 bales

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market showed firmness from the morning. Subsequently, due to purchases by the same trade and overseas merchants, the market closed steadily. Near and distant futures both rose by 2-3 points compared to the 2nd. The Indian cotton market has stabilized, with predictions of a 1 rupee increase. Egyptian cotton rose - over -- points.

Another report: Although the arrival of foreign cotton in Shanghai is high, all of it is being purchased by factories and delivered to factories. Spot goods in the hands of trading firms have been sold out. They are currently ordering Indian cotton futures, as there are few shipping spaces available and Indian cotton has already been ordered in large quantities. Therefore, current transactions are for May shipments. The factory price for yesterday's cotton market, converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 6.35 yuan, is as follows:

20-count, American Middling: 287.10

Again, Lower Grade: 278.00

30-count, Again: 303.10

Again, Lower Grade: 293.00

Again, Lower Grade: 296.00

### Coal: Hongji Fines in Short Supply; Coal Balls Tend to Rise Further

The source of Hongji white coal fines, the raw material for coal balls, has been decreasing in recent months due to restrictions imposed by the mines. In addition, the loss of the cargo on the Weiwei ship last week has wiped out the coal it carried. Furthermore, the managers are holding onto their stock, only supplying the needs of a few coal ball factories, causing a shortage in the market. Unofficial trading has taken the opportunity to rise. Hongji No. 2 fines are being quoted at 113-114 yuan, with further rises expected. No. 1 fines are available but there are no buyers. According to general observations, coal balls are likely to continue rising, and there is a rush to collect warehouse receipts, creating an unusually active market.

### Piece Goods: Linen, Poplin and Printed Cloth Sell Well

Domestic cloth: Yesterday's market was slightly soft, and business was somewhat lackluster. This is because recent sales of cloth, both spot and stockpiled, have been strong. Prices have soared, reversing the previous situation of expensive yarn and cheap cloth. The exchange rates of yarn and cloth were profitable, so the upward pressure on cloth prices has weakened. However, in specific markets, some factories are hoarding goods, causing sales prices to continue rising. Yesterday, British Lun Chang and Yih Ho colored and bleached cloth rose by 0.50 to 1 yuan, 14-pound coarse cloth rose by 0.50 yuan, and other prices remained flat. Merchants from Zhejiang's Wenzhou and Ningbo purchased over 700 pieces of coarse, colored, bleached, and fine cloth; merchants from Fujian and Guangdong purchased several hundred pieces of colored cloth and poplin; merchants from Anhui purchased over 100 pieces of striped bleached, fine, and colored cloth. Over 100,000 pieces of gray fabric were traded in spot and April-May futures markets. Retail and wholesale sales of current season's printed cloth, linen, foreign yarn, and poplin were brisk. East cloth, white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill started weakly but ended strong, with closing prices continuing to rise. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth once fell to 32.50 yuan in the morning, but recovered to 32.85 yuan later in the day. The opening price for this month was 33.10 yuan, but actual trading prices were even higher, with Longtou, Rishin, and other companies trading at 34.50 yuan for May delivery. Mid-range fine cloth traded at 33.75 to 34 yuan, with over 1,000 pieces sold.

Exports: Today (7th), 195 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 144 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 45 pieces to Haikou, and 945 pieces to Haiphong.

### Woolen Cloth Trading Remains Active, But Market Sentiment is Not as Strong as Before

Woolen cloth for Western suits remains strong, while materials for general Chinese clothing are weak. Demand from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Nanjing is not weak. Various parties in the market have healthy appetites. Brokers, firms, and wholesalers are still actively trading. However, trading by speculators outside the industry has become quiet. According to recent trends in the woolen cloth market, regardless of the type of material, the market is not as strong as it was in the first half of last month. Standard sales prices fluctuate.

### Sugar Market: Certain Parties Collect Green Sugar, Production Prices Higher Than Shanghai Market

According to a letter from Gulangyu, local Qing sugar is being collected by certain parties, pushing production prices higher than the Shanghai market. Shanghai's price now needs to reach around 53 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Southern Melon Seeds See New High

Due to shortages of newly arrived and stored white melon seeds, prices have been soaring. Yesterday, Shou Zhuang southern melon seeds were quoted at 75 yuan per 60 bags. Two firms divided the sales, and the market was very strong. This is a rare high price.

### Metals: Purple Copper Rods Remain Firm and Expensive

Purple copper rods are mostly produced by the United States and Japan. Since both countries are not within the scope of the European war, transportation is still convenient. However, Japan's production is recently insufficient for its own use, so there is no cargo coming to China. Most of the circulating goods on the market come from the United States. Current inventory in this city is not high. Traders and speculators all have thoughts of hoarding and profiteering. Users, such as those producing copper skin soldering irons, have strong demand. Furthermore, many buyers from northern China purchase from the same trade in this market, creating a confident sentiment, and standard quotations remain firm and expensive. Yesterday, there were over 100 dan (unit of weight) traded. The asking price for TC brand was 255 yuan per dan, and the asking price for T brand was 265 yuan per dan.

The white iron sheet sales market is most broad among the construction trade in this market. Sales have been smooth recently. Speculators also occasionally enter the market, so the market has not been very strong. Standard quotations have not changed significantly. 7-foot sheets are sold for 6.80 yuan each, and 6-foot sheets are sold for 5.80 yuan each.

Trading in plain white iron sheets has been smooth recently. Buyers from Tianjin, Qingdao, Wenzhou, Yantai, and Fujian are very active. Local factories and the construction trade are also making occasional purchases. Total sales in the city reached 200-300 bundles, which has improved the sentiment of the same trade, and sales prices have increased slightly. Currently, the market quote for 6-foot sheets is 5.70 yuan each, and 7-foot sheets are 6.70 yuan each. In addition, bamboo-joint steel bars from 3-4 points are still quoted at around 1,050 yuan due to sluggish business. Coarse colored steel bars from 5 points and up are down 50 yuan per ton.

### Import & Export: Tung Oil and Silk Waste Shipped to Italy

Today (7th), 9 pieces of tung oil and 40 pieces of silk waste were exported to Italy. 744 bags of soybeans and 76 pieces of tea were exported to Hong Kong. 2,000 boxes of tea were shipped to Tianjin.

### Overview of Shanghai Tinplate

—

Overview: Arrival of tinplate in our

country has more than 40 years of history. In the initial stage, it was mainly the United Kingdom, followed by the United States, and then Germany, France, Italy, Japan, etc. At that time, the tinplate needed by factories was mostly British goods. The colors sold only 90 pounds, 100 pounds (14 inches wide and 20 inches long), and 107 pounds (14 inches wide and 18.75 inches long), which were used by oil merchants. Since the first European war, British goods were once out of stock. American goods rose to replace them, and were widely sold in our country. The colors were only 90 pounds, 100 pounds and 107 pounds, but the material was better, so people were happy to buy them. The trend seemed to surpass British goods. The market also gradually became superior. In 1920, USCO steel (200 pounds per box) first arrived in China, but it was difficult to promote it in the market, because the dealers did not dare to buy and sell it easily, and the factories did not dare to try it. After half a year, the local factories in this city began to try it, but the number was small. After two years, the sales extended to the inland. At that time, British USCO steel (112 pounds per box) was also shipped to China, but the sales were not as wide as American goods. Until 1930, German, French and Italian goods were imported one after another. The colors used in the market also changed. For example, 90 pounds, 100 pounds, double speed goods (20 inches wide and 28 inches long), and the thickness ranged from 35 pounds to 120 pounds. The tinplate sales market in our country at this time can be said to be the most prosperous. Other small width tinplate, such as 2 to 10 inches, and plain sheet tinplate (Cobble from 5 to 8 inches), were shipped to China for trial sales. Finally, due to the cheap price, they met the needs of the Chinese people. The market for standard goods (20 inches and 28 inches, 14 inches and 20 inches) was hit. In the past five or six years, standard double speed tinplate of 170 pounds and 200 pounds (20 inches and 28 inches) produced by Yawata Factory and Zhongshan Factory of Japanese goods has been promoted to China by Japanese firms such as Yinghua Iwai. Although the products are good, the cost is high and it is difficult to promote. Therefore, it was just a flash in the pan and disappeared. In the past three or four years, the tinplate market in the sea has not only standard goods and USCO steel, but also blue-leaded USCO steel and blue bell standard steel. Because its cost is lower than tinplate, it can be sold well. Therefore, the sales of tinplate have been invaded. Since the Sino-Japanese War, due to various environmental factors in Shanghai, prices have soared, and the tinplate market has also doubled. Users are expensive. Therefore, they have switched to selling low-end goods. Black iron blanks have taken the opportunity to rise. Factories that usually need tinplate have mostly switched to using black iron blanks. Therefore, the tinplate market can be called a transitional era. (To be continued)

### Old News Re-copied Sixty-Seven Years Ago (447)

(From the Shen Bao of the 12th year of the Tongzhi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty)

Valuing Money Over Life

People come and go busily, all to seek meager profits. Almost everyone desires money and wealth, and some even value it above all else in life. This trend began after the Wei and Han dynasties and has been impossible to change ever since. In the era of the Three Dynasties, gold and silver were not particularly precious, just one type of treasure among many. The ancients warned against valuing goods too much, saying that "careless storage invites theft" and "excessive hoarding leads to ruin," all referring to precious jade and gems, not money. People exchanged goods and services, trading millet and cloth, with no need for gold and silver to buy things, so there was no use for it in transactions. From the Qin and Han dynasties onward, gold and silver began to be valued, but the common people still did not know how to use it. Therefore, there were instances of emperors bestowing hundreds of catties of gold, because it was not hoarded by the people. Since the people did not hoard it, they did not fight over its presence or absence. Only paper money was commonly used. Since then, paper money systems sometimes had flaws, and circulation was limited. People found paper money inconvenient to carry, so they hoarded gold and silver. Over the past two thousand years, customs have become decadent, and daily life has become more extravagant. As a result, everyone in the common populace hoards gold and silver for market transactions, and those with more money use gold and silver instead of coins. Then, unscrupulous people created exchange services to profit from this, and the money market arose. Gold is ultimately limited, but silver fills the marketplaces, becoming a major factor in the ups and downs of business. Because people use silver to buy things and exchange silver for coins, even farmers hoard it. If they didn't think it was so valuable, how could they be willing to die for it? However, all of this is due to the fact that unlearned and unskilled people have a limited view, valuing money over life, and only seeking money in their lives. They equate life to a feather, or even risk death to extort money for their families. Alas! If people didn't value gold and silver so much, why would such things happen so often? It is truly regrettable that the tradition of exchanging labor and goods has been lost.

### "Friends of the Wounded" and Children

— Lonely Goose

Every time a war begins, many soldiers are bound to be killed or wounded. Some have their legs blown off by cannons, others have their hands blown off by bombs. Although a few, the lucky ones, only receive one or two bullets, and after recovering for a month or two, they return to the battlefield. But most become disabled, or even die. They groan in the hospitals in the rear, tossing and turning. However, given the opportunity, they secretly escape to fight again. For the survival of the motherland, they are willing to give their lives, even the last drop of blood, to be shed on the battlefield. This spirit of "dedicating oneself to the utmost, until death" is worthy of our utmost respect!

We should give these respectable and lovable soldiers spiritual and material comfort. Therefore, someone has initiated the "Friends of the Wounded" movement. We are on an isolated island. Not to mention other work, this small thing should be done. Only by doing this can we say that we have fulfilled a part of our responsibility to the country, and can be worthy of the title of "Little Citizens of the Republic of China." Furthermore, it can let the people in the interior know that the people of Shanghai are not all living in a drunken dream, and that there are people who are awake while others are drunk!

If all the children became friends of the wounded, there would be about one million in Shanghai alone. How much more is that than the 100,000 people the government expects? Moreover, children can ask their family members, whether brothers, sisters, or parents, to be "Friends of the Wounded." If parents are not happy once, they can fail twice, and then say it a third time, even five or ten times… There are many things to pay attention to when speaking, such as:

(1) Speak when parents are happy. (2) Do not say it too directly, but slowly talk about the spirit of the wounded and their situation. Then gradually lead to the original intention of asking them to be "Friends of the Wounded." (3) Explain the benefits of "Friends of the Wounded" to the soldiers, such as encouraging their spirits, etc.

If the children go to persuade their parents according to the above method, they will certainly succeed. Most families in Shanghai have children. If everyone can complete these two steps, of course, all four million residents of Shanghai will succeed in being friends of the wounded, giving the soldiers great comfort.

Children, we should immediately unleash our great power to promote the "Friends of the Wounded" movement.

### National Tomb Sweeping Day

— Shadow Fool

Little friends! Since 1934, the Tomb Sweeping Festival has been designated as National Tomb Sweeping Day to commemorate all the national heroes in China's five-thousand-year history, and to list the surnames of national heroes. Among them are emperors, national soldiers, and military generals. Here, we might as well mention a few:

Among the emperors, the most worthy of our respect on National Tomb Sweeping Day, that is, Qingming Festival, is the Yellow Emperor. He ruled China in 2700 BC, conquered all foreign tribes in China, and established the status of the Chinese nation. According to legend, in addition to this achievement, he also invented clothing, the calendar, using sixty years as a cycle, and the compass. The latter helped him conquer foreign tribes that invaded Chinese territory. His empress taught the people the method of silkworm rearing, which was also a significant achievement and she is regarded as the goddess of silk. There is a temple in Shaanxi Province commemorating the Yellow Emperor, and after the government promulgated this National Tomb Sweeping Day in 1934, it sent representatives to pay tribute in front of the temple, and General Feng Yuxiang led the delegation as the chief celebrant.

The second Chinese emperor worthy of commemoration is Emperor Wu of Han. He ruled China from 140 BC to 86 BC. His most notable achievement as a monarch was conquering neighboring states of China and expanding the territory. His conquest of neighboring countries gradually brought China into contact with Western countries.

The first emperor who was equally successful in terms of military power was Emperor Taizong of Tang, who ruled China from 627 AD to 650 AD. The number of neighboring countries he conquered exceeded that of any other Chinese emperor. Therefore, his court was filled with envoys speaking various foreign languages.

The last one listed is Emperor Taizu of Ming, from 1368 AD to 1399 AD. His most notable achievement during his rule of China was driving the Mongols out of China. The Mongolians had entered China, established the Yuan Dynasty, and ruled for a century.

In addition to emperors and monarchs, several famous generals in Chinese history are also listed to show that they are worthy of national commemoration. Among them, the most worthy of mention is Yue Fei. During the decline of the Song Dynasty (around the beginning of the 12th century), he was able to resist the invasion of the Jin soldiers from the north, but his achievements were ultimately abandoned due to the evil deeds of treacherous officials. Finally, he died for his loyalty to the emperor. Yue Fei's story does not need further explanation, everyone knows it. In particular, Yue Fei's tomb on the banks of West Lake in Hangzhou still exists, which is a clear testimony to the national hero's loyalty to the emperor and love for the country!

### In a Flash

— Su Ming

The Yong'er's family lunch on Sunday was later than usual. Although his mother was in the kitchen helping the maid wash vegetables and cook rice, it was always a little late no matter what. The old woman kept asking Yong'er, "What time is it now?" He went to the living room to look at the clock hanging on the wall; then he shouted, "It's past twelve o'clock." His mother hurried to work even harder. In fact, twelve o'clock was not too late, but Yong'er's family was used to eating lunch around eleven thirty.

Zong'er always liked to joke with his younger brother. When he heard Yong'er shout like that, he asked, "How much past twelve o'clock is it?" "Twelve ten." "Twelve ten and how many seconds?" Zong'er kept asking. "What does this few seconds have to do with our lunch time?" Yong'er became impatient with the questions.

"It's not like that. You need to know that accumulating seconds makes minutes, accumulating minutes makes hours, accumulating hours makes days... One second after another passes, although it is very short. In our daily life. We take seconds very lightly, and sometimes we don't even calculate minutes. In ancient times, when clocks had not yet been invented, they used the sun or water droplets to measure time, and there were no minutes or seconds. Life was of course simpler. Later, people's lives gradually became more complicated, and someone invented the clock, so there were minutes and seconds. It can be seen that the more complicated human life becomes, the more finely time is divided. Maybe our lives will be more complicated in the future, then time will be even finer. Although seconds occupy a secondary position in our daily life, it is not enough for scientific use, so it is divided into smaller parts." When his brother said this, Yong'er interjected, "Then what is the name for dividing seconds into smaller parts?"

"There is no specific name for that. Only one-fortieth of a second, one-hundredth of a second, one-thousandth of a second..."

"Although one-thousandth of a second is very small in our eyes, small creatures around us don't think it's very short. For example, a mosquito can flap its small wings up or down once in one-thousandth of a second. Our quickest action is a blink of an eye. Do you know how much time it takes for a blink of an eye? A foreigner made an accurate measurement: a blink of an eye takes an average of one-fifth of a second, which is four hundred milliseconds - eyelid down: (takes one hundred thirty to one hundred seventy milliseconds). Eyelid up again: (takes one hundred seventy milliseconds). You see, a blink of an eye has already taken so much time, and to divide these few actions, so if we analyze a very ordinary event carefully, we can discover very interesting questions." "In the blink of an eye, an old chicken becomes a duck." "Although this old saying is not scientific, in the eyes of those small animals, in the blink of a human's eye, it is possible for an old chicken to become a duck." Yong'er laughed loudly when he heard this.

### Black Brothers (12)

— Yi Mu

Xiang Hua heard that when Hans went to the Gold River to get gold, he stole holy water, perhaps the king of the Gold River did not approve of this method, so he discussed it in his heart that he must set another method to succeed. After a day, he took the money earned from a small chore and contacted an immoral pastor to buy some holy water, he thought this time it was foolproof. The next morning, before the sun had risen, he got up quickly, brought some wine and bread in a basket, and put the holy water in a bottle, then he set off to the mountain.

Like Hans before, he shrank back a little when he saw the Sha River, it was not easy to cross it, but he lost the basket. Although there were no clouds in the sky on this day, it was not bright, a heavy purple fog was pressing down all around, and the four mountains were sometimes dim and unclear. Xi Hua climbed the sloping path, and like Hans, he suddenly felt thirsty, so he picked up the basket containing holy water and took a sip. At this moment, he caught sight of a child lying on a stone nearby, crying to him, asking for some water to drink.

Xi Hua said coldly, "Hum, want water to drink! I myself don't have enough to drink." As he spoke, he moved forward. At this time, the sunlight went down even more. Suddenly, a large pile of dark clouds pushed up from the west; he climbed on the mountain path for more than an hour, and became thirsty again. He had to pick up the holy water to drink again. Unexpectedly, he saw an old man lying in front of him, crying to him for water to drink. Xi Hua said coldly again, "Hum, want water to drink! I myself don't have enough to drink." As he spoke, he walked forward.

At this moment, he felt that the light in front of him was gone, and suddenly it became dark. When he looked up, he saw a blood-red fog covering the sun; the large pile of dark clouds rose very high, and the edges of the clouds were constantly undulating, like angry waves in the sea. A long shadow under the dark cloud lay across Huan Hua's path.

Xi Hua climbed on the mountain for another hour, and felt thirsty again, so he held the water bottle to his mouth again, suddenly he seemed to see his brother Hans falling on the mountain road in front of him, stretching out his arms, shouting for water to drink. Xi Hua laughed loudly, "Haha, you are here? My child, remember the iron bars in the prison, which kept me locked up so painfully, but you refused to redeem me. Now you are asking me for water to drink! Did I bring water here with so much effort to give you to drink?" Immediately, he strode over Hans' body; at the same time, he seemed to see a strange mocking expression on Hans' mouth. He walked a few yards, turned his head, but Hans was gone.

### What Kind of Children Does Jesus Want Us to Be

Little friends! This is a big question, what kind of children does Jesus want us to be? There are many answers to this question. Among Jesus' apostles, one was the most faithful, most enthusiastic, and most knowledgeable, and that is Paul. Let's ask him this question and see how he answers. We sometimes look in the mirror to see what our faces look like. What Paul said is like a mirror. We look at our faces to see what dirt and black spots are on our faces. So that we can ask the Lord Jesus to cleanse us. "Let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth." There is a treasure whose value cannot be calculated by numbers, and that is diligence. So the Chinese proverb says: (Diligence is a priceless treasure) People are not afraid of being foolish, only afraid of being lazy. Because (diligence can make up for clumsiness) (diligence comes and goes, and overturns the mountain). People are not afraid of being poor, only afraid of being lazy. Because (diligence is diligent, and food and clothing are guaranteed. Diligence is diligent, and you will be full). "Forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." Little friends! Please think about how many times you have thought wrong, said wrong things, and done wrong things. As long as you ask God for forgiveness, God will forgive you. Because God (is willing to forgive people) Do you also like to forgive those who offend you? Sometimes I hear children say: I will never forgive him! The person who says this may not know what Jesus said: (For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.) If you want God to forgive you, you must also forgive people. "And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted" Always be kind to people, always use a smiling face to say things that make people happy, and you will be even happier. "Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor" Jesus wants us to never lie no matter what, rather suffer a loss than lie, rather lose face than lie. Prevent yourself from saying the first lie, because if you say the first lie, you will inevitably say the second, and after three years of lying, you are still deceiving yourself. "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice" Speaking is like playing the piano and painting, it is an art. The most difficult art to learn, an art that cannot be learned in a lifetime. Children should learn to speak from an early age. Once a word is spoken, it is hard to take back. A word can kill, and a word can save. Therefore, it is said that you should guard your mouth like a bottle, it is better to speak less than more. More is easy to make mistakes, less is easy to be good. A father asked his two children for a piece of white ink paper each, an ink brush, one child used it to exhaust a beautiful scenery, with mountains, water, and flowers and trees, everyone saw it and was happy, that one child used it to draw indiscriminately, not like anything at all. Only a piece of white paper was ruined. People spend their lives in these two different ways. Some people's lives are beautiful, available, people get happiness, God gets glory, some people just mislead their lives and waste their lives, spend their time in vain, ask for trouble for themselves, harm people a lot, and shame the Lord who created them. Little friends! If you are a child that Jesus likes, your life will become a beautiful scenery (End)

### About Chaplin's "The Great Dictator"

— New Movie

Filming Completed

Cane and Worn Shoes Still Perform

Regarding Chaplin's "The Great Dictator," we have recently received some detailed reports, and the following points are worth reporting to readers.

About to be Released: After more than two years, the entire filming of Chaplin's new film "The Great Dictator" is almost complete. After some time for editing, it will probably begin its premiere in the United States and greet the audience for the first time.

Breaking Preconceptions: Since the invention of sound films, Chaplin has always expressed opposition to sound films and has had preconceptions about speaking on screen. However, this preconception has now been broken. In "The Great Dictator," he not only broke the taboo for the first time and actually spoke, but also indicated to people that he has admitted that opening his mouth on the screen may increase the effect and attract more movie audiences.

Four Important Roles: In "The Great Dictator," there are many roles. Regarding international figures, there are roles that allude to the four important figures of Hitler, Mussolini, General Goering, and Goebbels. As for the female roles, they are not important, and Chaplin himself plays two roles, the dictator and another young man.

Cane and Worn Shoes: According to Hollywood rumors, Chaplin in "The Great Dictator" once again used his special trademark - many antiques - on the screen, as in the past legends. If this is true, then Chaplin's worn shoes, cane, top hat, and other items will once again attract our attention.

Truly Difficult to Understand: To what extent Chaplin satirizes Hitler and the National Socialist Party in this film is not certain, although there are various rumors outside. Because in advance, Mr. Zhuo and his photography staff kept secrets about these. So what the truth is, we have to wait for the facts to prove it, we have no way to measure it until the film is officially released! There were quite a few delicate and exquisite toys displayed on the piano. After taking her tea, I took a sip and started talking about the cigarette she held in her slender fingers.

"Does Miss Cheng like to smoke?" "No, they just taught me how to smoke, maybe it will be used in a play in 'China Travel'". She said with a shy smile.

### Interview with Cheng Ying, a Newcomer on Stage

— Zhang Zi

Miss Xishi Cheng Ying

It was a bright and sunny morning, when the sun was covering the earth with a golden coat, I walked to the "Xishi" residence of "Yilin" and gently knocked on the door twice, Miss Cheng came out to greet me with a smile. The furnishings of her room were quite good. Are you joining 'China Travel' to act in a play?" "Yes, playing Manli in 'Flowers Splashed with Tears'."

"Miss, you act very well. I have seen your 'Demon of Desire'."

"Where? I acted terribly, I basically don't know how to act". She said very modestly, followed by a burst of silver bell-like laughter.

"Did Miss Cheng study in Tianjin?" I asked casually, taking a puff of cigarette.

"No, I didn't study in Tianjin for a few years. Later, I came to Shanghai and finished middle school in Zhengxingli".

"This time, 'Xishi' of 'Yike' is being staged, and you are starring in it?" I looked at the script on the sofa and asked her.

"Yes, but I am very ashamed. I don't know the basic conditions for acting, and I don't have stage experience, how can I play this great 'Xishi' ". These days the rehearsals are busy!" "I'm so busy, I have to rush to rehearse 'Flowers Splashed with Tears' in China Travel in the morning, and then rehearse 'Xishi' in Yilin in the afternoon. I really don't even have time to eat". The expression seems very unhappy. "How do you feel about the play 'Xishi'?"

"I think it should be said that this play is another stimulant for the audience after 'Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty'." She said excitedly.

"Then, will there be any problems with your performance?"

(Probably not, because this is the truth" "Miss, have you performed in many plays before?"

"I acted in many small plays when I was studying at school, and later I acted in "Thunderstorm", "Demon of Desire", "Song of Shanghai" and several other plays".

Speaking of this, the wind was rising and it was going to rain, so I said goodbye and left.

### Tian Han's Activities in Northern Hunan

— Hai Xing

According to recent news, art propaganda in the northern Hunan area has been quite active since Tian Han took the lead. The film "Great Victory in Northern Hunan" compiled by Tian is currently taking exterior shots in Gaogiao, Pingjiang, and the actors are all members of the second and eighth teams of the Anti-Japanese War Drama Troupe of the Political Department, with a total of more than 50 people, most of whom are Shanghai exiles.

The Peking Opera Troupe has now become a direct team of the Political Department. It is subsidized by the department every month, and the plays performed are all adapted by Tian Han. However, the lineup is not complete. The only one worth watching is the Dan role Li Yaqin. The others, such as Wu Sheng, Xiao Sheng, and Da Mian, are simply terrible. Tian Han once proposed to send someone to Shanghai to invite actors, but it was cancelled due to insufficient funds.

### News of Actors

Jin Suqin was originally scheduled to take over from Wang Xichun at the Hong Kong Lee Theatre on the 3rd, but the reporter received news that the theater had telegraphed to Shanghai to invite the supporting actors, saying that the second phase would be temporarily suspended.

Lin Shusen has performed in Hong Kong for ten days and is relatively familiar with the situation there. According to him, there are two reasons for the failure of Peking Opera in Hong Kong: First, people in Hong Kong are indeed rarely interested in Peking Opera. Second, the organizational structure of the Peking Opera troupe is unsound, and the costumes are too old, often simplifying things due to poverty, compared with the Cantonese opera troupe with a neat headcount and bright costumes, there is a world of difference, so the audience who are used to Cantonese opera have an even worse impression of Peking Opera.

Chen Xiaomu, a civil and military Lao Sheng of the Grand Stage, is scheduled to get married on the 11th day of the lunar March. The wedding hall is located at the Zhimei Building on Simalu. Colleagues backstage have launched a public celebration and will send a church meeting, with magic, martial arts, technology, flying car team and slippery Peking Opera, etc.

Gu Zhuxuan has formally requested Dong Zhaobin to allow the Sheng Zhang Mingsheng to join the Da Chan Stage. He has been agreed, and Mingsheng will probably join when Huang Tianba's new play is staged.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Ma Lianliang's Side Flags in Lintong Mountain

Mei Lanfang's fame is due to the creation of new antique dramas, melting Qingyi and Hua Dan into one. However, his skills are profound, his talent is particularly good, and he is able to humbly learn from others, extensively collect the brilliant insights of literati and intellectuals, and conduct careful research and exploration, and then dare to meet the audience in his new costumes. Therefore, the so-called Mei School antique dramas a decade ago did become popular for a time. Today, his antique dramas such as "Goddess Scattering Flowers" and "Daiyu Burying Flowers", although they are simple in plot, have long disappeared from the opera stage, however, there are still many Dan roles that often appear in the eyes of customers wearing antique costumes, which proves that any invention of a new costume must have the conditions of beauty and lightness, and then it can be maintained permanently, imitated by others, and not criticized by experts.

Since Yu San (Shuyan) retired from the Sheng line, Lianliang has fortunately become famous. It is said that there are no generals in Shu, and Liao Hua is the vanguard. In terms of what he has learned, almost nineteen of them are skills from the general road of the class, singing is a small part of the sharp troupe Yin and Yang, and Wu Gong has no foundation at all. For more than ten years, he has been able to arrange many plays, turn Bangzi into Pihuang, or add beginnings and endings to old plays, so that the time of each play is lengthened. Generally those with shallow views feel that they can hear the axle play above eight or ten quarters with little money, so they all flock to it. Gradually, he became the leader of the Ma School, and seemed to be the first person after Shuyan. In fact, at a time when there is an extreme lack of Sheng talents today, I do not want to blame Lianliang for working hard to improve, but his habit of not humbly asking for advice and not knowing how to hide his clumsiness has never been changed. I am afraid that there will be a danger of prosperity and decline. Seeing his recent unexpected fiasco in the Ping Opera "Lintong Mountain" and the criticism from the public opinion, we can know that my words are not wrong.

In the recent All-India National Congress, Mr. Gandhi said in his statement to Reuters: "I will not be content until India is as free as Britain." It is found that when Britain declared war on Germany last year, it claimed it was a war between democracy and imperialism, so Mr. Mahatma Gandhi's request can be said to be asking Britain to practice democracy. At this moment, we believe that it will definitely be twice the result with half the effort.

Origin of the Name Mahatma

Speaking of Mr. Gandhi, he is truly worthy of the title of Mahatma (the transliteration of Mahatma is Mahatma, meaning "great soul"). Since 1893, he has gone to South Africa to practice law, using the law to speak out against injustices for his compatriots. Until now, at a high age, he continues to endure hardships and struggles for the liberation of the Indian nation. When mentioning him, not only do the people of India admire him, but people all over the world also praise him, and even his enemies respect him quite a bit. Gandhi once negotiated with the Indian Governor in prison. He said with a smile: "I got a good deal from the iron window." This kind of great personality is rarely seen in the world. Some ignorant people in India believe that Gandhi is the reincarnation of the Buddha. Regarding this point, Gandhi often explained that he is just like ordinary people, without any mystery. Once, there was a dry well that had been without water for many years. Coincidentally, after Gandhi passed by, there was water in the well. The villagers regarded him as sacred and came to his house to pray and thank him. He said to these superstitious people: "You are all fools. Undoubtedly, this is a coincidence. Let me ask you something." Then his face changed from seriousness to kindness, and he explained the so-called mystery to the villagers in the local language.

The Small Village Where Gandhi Lives

Gandhi is seventy-one years old this year. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, northwest of Bombay. He got married at the age of one and went to England for studies at the age of nineteen. He now lives in a thatched cottage in the small village of Segaon in central India, far from the train station. In the past, this small village was a gathering place for illiteracy, poverty, filth, and disease in Indian villages. Three years ago, Gandhi and his followers built tents and settled here, and now it has become a model village. Night schools, weaving classes, health centers, and scientific farms are all very active. In fact, this place is the headquarters for the revival of handicrafts and Gandhi's plan to promote rural areas.

Gandhi's Daily Life

Gandhi gets up at three o'clock every morning and spends about an hour on correspondence. At four o'clock, he leads his followers in silence and prayer. At four thirty, he takes a walk and receives guests. He walks very vigorously, and young men and women have to run to keep up with him. After returning home, he has yogurt as breakfast, which is the first of his three simplest meals of the day. Gandhi is an absolute vegetarian. His food is prepared by Mrs. Gandhi and costs only about five US dollars per month. He eats very evenly. Contrary to many people's expectations, although the food is simple, his body is very good and his spirit is strong. After breakfast, he holds meetings to discuss issues, ranging from reorganizing the kitchen in the group to how to end British rule. He goes to bed in an open-air tent near midnight. In order to share the joys and sorrows with the poor, he does not use a mosquito net, but applies kerosene to his face to keep mosquitoes away. Like Napoleon, he falls asleep as soon as he lies down.

Gandhi is Good at Speaking

Probably because of "sincerity moving people", whenever he persuades people to donate relief funds after a speech, the audience will give generously. Women will even donate their bracelets and ornaments. There is an article in Living Age called Gandhi's Appeal, which tells the story of a woman who wanted to listen to Gandhi's speech. Her husband advised her to take off all her gold chains, bracelets, and ornaments to avoid being moved to donate after listening to the speech and suffering losses. Although the woman obeyed and took them off, she still left a pair of light bracelets out of vanity and decided not to donate. Who knew that she still donated them to Gandhi in the end and returned home empty-handed. She was very anxious because she had no words to face her husband. Unexpectedly, her husband did not intend to listen to the speech, but was invited by a friend to participate in the meeting and also put all fifty rupees he had prepared to pay the rent for the next day into the donation box. From this story, we can see the touching nature of Gandhi's speeches and the Indian people's worship of Gandhi.

### Nehru, An Outstanding Indian

— Wei Yan

"India naturally needs a great change today. But even if all the changes we need have arrived, we cannot be quiet. Nothing in the world is permanent. Everything in nature changes every day, every moment. Only death is the cessation of development and the state of stillness. But many people do not admit that the world is changing. They close their minds and do not allow new ideas to be injected into their brains. But the world is still progressing. At the same time, because they and people like them do not adapt to the changing environment, major disasters often occur. Major revolutions, like the French Revolution of one hundred and forty years ago and the Russian Revolution of thirteen years ago, are about to happen. Even so, in our

Nehru's Views on Indian Reform

country, we are in the process of revolution today. We naturally need independence. But we also need other things. We need to clear all stagnant water and inject fresh springs everywhere. We should eliminate the filth, poverty, and misfortune in the country. At the same time, we must try our best to eliminate the outdated ideas in the hearts of many people." This is what Nehru, the Indian leader, said in a letter to his beloved daughter Indira from Dehradun Prison in 1931. From this letter, we can know the ambition in the heart of this fighter for Indian national liberation. Now that India has demanded independence, this international friend, who once represented India, represented the poet Tagore, and represented the Indian national leader to visit China last year, and earnestly hoped for China's victory, can be regarded as a model for future Indian liberation, and will inevitably assume his responsibility and strive for his motherland under Gandhi's leadership.

Mr. Nehru is fifty-one years old this year and was born in Allahabad, India. His father, Motilal, was also a fighter for the Indian nation, and devoted his later years to the liberation of the Indian nation. He died in 1931. Therefore, Nehru's father was also a famous figure in India. In order to facilitate identification, Indians only call Nehru's name Jawaharlal to avoid confusion with his father. He studied law in England in his early years. After returning to China, he immediately participated in the national movement and became a leader of Indian Muslims. When the non-cooperation movement occurred in 1921, he enthusiastically supported this movement, which eventually led to his arrest and imprisonment. From his prison life, he studied political and economic thought, which transformed him into a socialist thinker. After more than ten years of struggle, his position in India

His Life

has become increasingly lofty, second only to Gandhi. The people of India love and respect him no less than Gandhi. His wife is Mrs. Kamala, who is from the Brahmin family in Kashmir. She died in 1936. He has a daughter, Indira, who was mentioned above. She is currently studying in England.

Nehru is five feet ten inches tall and has a very upright figure. He likes sports and swimming very much. He usually wears a white Gandhi cap. Under the white cap, gray hair has already appeared, which shows his hard work for India.

His Life

weary. His face is quite white, unlike the Indians we usually see in Shanghai. He wears a white Indian-style loincloth with a vest outside, just like other Indian Gandhi followers. He wears grass shoes on his feet. Looking at such an outfit, you would never think that he is from an aristocratic family.

### Tagore from Three Perspectives

— Fang Qi

An Eastern-style Missionary

A Poet with Modern Flair

The thoughts that Buddhism generated in China and the documents of translated Buddhist scriptures preserved by India are sufficient to prove the close relationship between China and India. Within this close relationship, the differences between the Chinese and Indian cultural spirits are also evident. What the Indian people possess is the spirit of preaching, while what the Chinese people possess is the spirit of seeking the Dharma. The sufficient proof of this explanation cannot be presented here. Only because we are going to talk about Tagore, this explanation is just right. Tagore came to China twice. Although this was not much different from his visits to Europe and America, he did indeed grant and receive the spirit of teaching in China, and this seems to be obviously different.

Last year, Tan Yunshan, who was studying at International University, published a booklet "Tagore and China." This year, someone congratulated Tagore on his 80th birthday (he was born in 1861, making him 80 years old this year, which can be considered Eastern-style). His already dim image

India's is About to be Noticed

seems to be gradually emerging again. Naturally, it is not because he has something particularly noteworthy, but because the entire India is gradually attracting attention and hope. He certainly thought that Easterners were naturally more likely to understand the Eastern spirit,

The Indian Poet-Philosopher in the Eyes of the Chinese

and therefore thought that his ideals were also more likely to be accepted by the Chinese. His lectures in China were quite missionary in nature. Of course, his influence was very small, and the second time almost caused the opposite effect, but a Tagore-style poem did once become popular in literary circles, and several people ran to International University to study. Just in this small range, we pay attention to him, and he is naturally one of the figures that must be thought of when thinking of India. This year's India is not only naturally noticed by us, but also the eyes of the whole world are focused on it. Just talking about the book review column of the Asia Magazine in the past three or four issues, most of the books introduced are about India. As for the Indian figures involved, they all only talk about Gandhi and Nehru, and Tagore seems to be forgotten, but soon the West will have more general attention to India, and at that time, the Westerners' tastes may turn out to be Tagore.

However, Tagore is not a purely Eastern-style teacher either. Although he has religious philosophical concepts, he never attempted to succeed as a religious figure; he is also called a saint, but not because he is like a monk who lives in the forest; his international

Tagore's Educational Thought

Although the university has the meaning of a monastery, the goal it points to is still the goal of modern education. Gandhi used an Eastern-style method of resistance, but what he wanted to build was a Western-style democratic country. Although Tagore's works are clothed in Eastern-style clothing, the actual purpose is to gradually bring ancient Indian literature closer to the modern spirit. The reason why he was able to stand out as a special poet in a country with more poets than carp is precisely because his poems already contain a modern flavor, so predecessors cannot compare with him. Moreover, he did not want to create several more Oriental poets. He paid a lot of attention to practical life in education.

### Special Issue on National Products

— Fang Yexian

The Way Out for National Products

Tao Yuanming of the Jin Dynasty once wrote an ancient-style poem, which included the line: "Bright is the moon in the clouds, shining is the leaves of China, how can there be no time of goodness, what will happen soon?" His meaning is that good times do not last long, and good times do not always come. This situation can be used to describe the current situation of the national products industry. The national products industry once flourished, but after the "August 13th" war broke out, the coastal cities of China fell, and the first to be hit was China's national industry. Not only was the original sales market blocked by the Japanese military, but the industries themselves were also destroyed by Japanese aircraft bombings, and even the machines for making money were turned into ashes. The survivors were only the national product factories in a corner of the Shanghai Concession. Although these factories have reduced their scope and managed miserably, they can barely maintain. However, many of them have had to close down due to the shrinking market, the blockade of the seaports, and the obstruction of transportation, which made it impossible to transport goods to the interior for sale, resulting in an overabundance of national products in Shanghai, making sales difficult, while the interior had an urgent need but no way to purchase them. Therefore, the first main problem for the national product industry at present is how to open up the market so that supply and demand can be connected, so that there will be no phenomenon of overproduction in the production area, while the interior has money but no goods to buy. Therefore, for the national product industry to have a way out, it must have the vast market of a free China, which cannot be handled by the narrow market of Shanghai, which is like a lone bird. From this point of view, in order to seek its own development, if the national product factory cannot move its factory to the interior, it should at least set up a branch factory in the interior and establish a solid foundation in the interior. The significance of this is not limited to its own development, but also includes the meaning of cultivating the strength of the Anti-Japanese War and economic construction. The second main problem is naturally to open up overseas markets. Nanyang, Hong Kong and other places have higher purchasing power than domestic markets, and the price of currency is also higher than domestic markets in those places, which is the most favorable condition for the export of national products. However, to achieve the goal of selling national products well overseas: in terms of the national products themselves, the quality should be improved so that national products can compete with goods from various countries, and overseas Chinese should be made aware of the excellent quality of national products and be happy to purchase them. The third main problem is the promotion of the purchase of national products and the encouragement of the production of national products by the Chinese people. During the Anti-Japanese War, buying one more share of national products meant one less share of leakage. All national products that already exist should be purchased first, and national products that do not yet exist should be encouraged to be produced. Industrial construction is a major event for a hundred years and cannot be achieved overnight. However, as long as every citizen has patriotism and self-awareness, and promotes it widely and is happy to purchase it, China has a large population, and no matter how low its purchasing power is, and no matter how difficult the current environment is, as long as everyone can recognize the importance of promoting national products, the future of national products is still bright and brilliant, and I hope the Chinese people will rise up and plan for it.

Introduction to National Product Factories

### General Situation of the Shanghai Factory of Sincere Cosmetics Company: Pioneer of the National Cosmetics Industry, Vanguard of Opening up Sales in Nanyang

— Zhong Wangshu

Sincere Cosmetics Company was founded in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915), and its first factory was established in Guangzhou with a capital of HK$1.3 million; in the eleventh year (1922), the second factory was established in Hong Kong, which coincided with our country's recovery of tariff autonomy and gained the opportunity; in the eighteenth year (1929), another HK$100,000 was allocated to establish the third factory on Huade Road in Shanghai, which was registered with the Ministry of Industry. One year before the January 28th Incident (1931), the factory was moved to its current location on Maqi Road. The fact that it was able to avoid losses during the Second World War was due to this measure.

When the factory was first established, its annual turnover was only 100,000 yuan. After years of effort, it has now increased tenfold. Its main products are Sincere Toothpaste, Qianlixiang Perfume, Hair Growth Oil, Toilet Water, and Soap. Among them, the most widely sold and reputable product is Sincere Toothpaste, which accounts for half of the total turnover. The sales can be divided into two major regions: Shanghai and domestic, and Nanyang and overseas, each accounting for half. Nanyang has a large number of overseas Chinese, and Shanghai is the most prosperous city in the country. As national products continue to improve, the Chinese people are naturally happy to purchase them to replace expensive imported goods. The future of national cosmetics is truly unlimited.

Now, among its main products, I will describe the manufacturing process of toothpaste and perfume as follows:

Toothpaste

1.  Mix the raw materials such as glycerin powder with a machine; 2. Add the dentifrice ingredients such as peppermint oil, menthol, and thymol and mix well; 3. After two days, use a machine to fill the tubes.
2.  Mix the fragrance and alcohol evenly; 2. Store in a large glass bottle for a considerable period; 3. Filter with a water-jacketed machine to remove impurities; 4. Then use an electric air pump to first extract the air in the bottle, and then fill the bottle.

According to customs statistics, the value of imported cosmetics is so large that it is alarming. Fortunately, the Chinese people can catch up quickly and compete to set up factories to manufacture them, which can recover a lot of leakage. Recently, many raw materials for cosmetics have been made in China, such as alcohol and peppermint. There are many Chinese products. Only chemical products such as thymol still depend on others. I hope that researchers will devote more effort, so that it is not difficult to achieve a good state of self-production and self-sufficiency.

### The Status of "Red Potion" in the Family and its Preparation and Application

— Yu Tai

In the family, children and adults inevitably suffer from skin abrasions, cuts, or burns. As a result, the wound often becomes red and swollen, and even expands in scope and produces pus. This is common. In our China, in the past, when encountering skin injuries, we often applied some incense ash to cover it. Now we have realized that incense ash is inappropriate, so iodine wine and so-called "red potion" have become very common in the family. Iodine wine is quite irritating, especially when iodine wine is applied to skin wounds, the stinging pain is unbearable for children, so "red potion" is fortunately welcomed.

"Red potion" is a common name. Its chemical name is "disodium salt of dibromomercury fluorescein red." Commercially, it has names such as pigment mercury, red mercury, and monovalent mercury. It contains 23% to 24% mercury and is a precious green flake or granular crystal. What we buy from the pharmacy is already prepared as a solution, which is dark red, so it is generally called "red potion." It has the ability to kill bacteria without the irritation of iodine wine. It has penetrating power to human tissue and reaches the inside of the skin. The solution we usually use is a 2% solution. For family use, you can buy crystals from the pharmacy and prepare it according to the following method:

Crystals 2 parts

Distilled water 100 parts to make a 2% solution

If you want more efficacy, follow the

following method to make a 2% solution

Crystals 2 parts

Distilled water 35 parts

Alcohol 55 parts

Vinegar (Acetone) 10 parts

If the skin wound is very large, you can use "red potion" to rinse it. For small wounds, you can apply it several times. If the wound has grease, you must first wash it with gasoline and apply the medicine to ensure direct contact with the wound. If the grease is not easy to remove, use medicine to rinse, wipe, or immerse it in the medicine. Finally, use gauze to bandage it. For safety, it is still necessary to reapply it once a day. Following this method, bacteria will have no chance to invade the human body. this year

### Visit to the Michelin Toothpaste Factory

— Ju Sheng

Small-scale industry, large-scale production

Well-equipped, excellent quality

Ju Sheng

Toothpaste has now become a daily necessity for general families. At a certain period, almost all of the products sold on the market were foreign goods. The outflow of money was indeed not a small amount. Later, domestic toothpastes were introduced to the market. Their efficacy and quality kept pace with the times, and the selling price was relatively low. Therefore, sales became more and more widespread, and the number of users increased. They have gradually taken the place of imported goods, blocking the leakage and recovering the rights and interests. This should indeed be attributed to the enthusiastic promotion and willingness to purchase by people in the society. However, the efforts of domestic manufacturers to produce and strive for excellence, their achievements are worthy of praise.

Michelin toothpaste is one of the products of Shanghai Baitan Xiang Soap Factory. As soon as it was launched, it became popular and had the potential to surpass others. Yesterday, I visited the factory and met Mr. Zhang Yiting, the manager of the factory. He told me about the history of the branch factory and the process of formulation and refining of Michelin toothpaste raw materials. I hereby summarize it as follows to inform readers who are concerned about the national product industry.

History of the Branch Factory

The Baitan Xiang Soap General Factory is located in Tianjin. It has been specializing in the production of Baitan Xiang Soap. Because its products sell well, its business is very prosperous. It has no time to produce the subsidiary cosmetics. Moreover, after the war, the sea ports were blocked and it was difficult to transport them to Shanghai. Therefore, a branch factory was established in Shanghai. The factory is located on Puen Jishi Road. Michelin toothpaste was first launched, and other products such as snow cream and hair oil will be launched continuously after the machine parts are installed and ready to be used by the Chinese people. All the funds of the branch factory are allocated by the Tianjin factory. All the equipment is completely modern, hoping to contribute exquisite domestic toothpaste to the society. It is not solely for the purpose of making profits.

Internal Overview

The internal organization of the branch factory is divided into three major parts: (1) chemical preparation; (2) mechanical production; (3) mechanical packaging. The equipment and layout are all mechanized. When I entered the factory gate, the sound of machines filled the entire factory. Male and female workers were wearing white uniforms, like doctors and nurses in a hospital. Everyone was busy with their work. In the chemical room, bottles were lined up, and chemical instruments filled the room. Various specialized technicians were carefully measuring and preparing the raw materials. After the fixed components of more than 20 kinds of raw materials were prepared, they were transported to the "mixing machine" in the production department for mixing and blending. Then, the "rolling mill" was used to grind them into a greasy paste, which was sent to the packaging department. First, the "filling machine" was used to pour the toothpaste into tin tubes, and then the "crimping machine" was used to crimp the lead edges to complete all the processes. Finally, the work was completed by manual packaging. According to people in the factory, the daily output of the factory is 250 baskets, which is 3,000 dozen.

Reasons for Popularity

Recently, doctors have generally recognized that the health of teeth is closely related to human longevity. To protect teeth and promote oral hygiene, the use of top-quality toothpaste is the most convenient, economical and effective method. Michelin is a medicinal toothpaste. The raw materials are pure and the formula is appropriate. It has a unique effect on protecting teeth, hygiene, and protecting the oral cavity. Therefore, its popularity is not accidental.

Meaning of the Name

Michelin is the latest and fastest express train in the world. The factory adopted it as a trademark and named the toothpaste after Michelin, implying that it can be compared to it.

### The Future of the National Products Movement

— Born in the Year of Dingwei

——Each less purchase of foreign goods is one more point of our strength.

Promoting national products is our bounden duty and the work we should be doing. Especially in this time of national crisis, when the lifeline of national survival hangs by a thread, every Chinese citizen should earnestly undertake the duty of promoting and using national products. Only in this way can we be free from shame and guilt.

However, what is past is past, and what is to come can be pursued. How should the national products movement in China be promoted in the future to achieve "twice the result with half the effort?" Regarding this, I believe that we should start with both producers and consumers, and only then will there be a solution. On the one hand, we desperately hope that the national products manufacturing sector will use domestic raw materials as much as possible (and absolutely avoid using raw materials from enemy countries during wartime). In terms of product quality, strive for excellence to compete with foreign goods. However, the selling price should adhere to a "small profits, quick turnover" policy to accommodate the purchasing power of citizens under high living costs. In addition, advertising and promotion must be realistic, and packaging must be practical. These are the minimum conditions that the national products manufacturing sector should pay attention to and achieve in the future.

As for consumers, we should recognize that we are in a very serious emergency period. We can no longer live a muddled and confused life as in the past. Today, if we buy one more cent's worth of foreign goods, it is equivalent to eating a bullet in our stomach, which is equivalent to committing suicide. The national crisis is so severe that even if we cannot stand at the forefront of national defense and participate in actual resistance work, the minimum requirement of using national products should be earnestly fulfilled. Some people say: Where can we buy genuine national products? Haha! Convenient, convenient! Isn't the national products company the main base for promoting national products?

In short, the national products movement in the future should focus on practical implementation rather than paying attention to verbal propaganda. I hope that the national products manufacturing sector will work hard in the front, and consumers will follow closely behind. Only in this way is there a possibility of success for the national products movement.
