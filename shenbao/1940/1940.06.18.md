One hour before General Pétain's declaration, the British Expeditionary Force and French troops were still fighting against the German army on the Normandy front. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Bordeaux Port: The new cabinet held a meeting at 10:00 this morning and issued a public statement saying, "The government has made a decision due to the pressure of the situation." Premier General Pétain then broadcast to the nation, stating, "I wrote to the enemy yesterday, asking if he would meet with me, like two soldiers, in a dignified manner after the battle, to seek a path to peace." (Havas dispatch, 17th)

New York: According to news from the National Broadcasting Company, the new French Premier, General Pétain, has announced the surrender to Germany. The National Broadcasting Company received the following telegram from General Pétain: "Last night, I contacted the German headquarters. I now announce with deep sorrow that we have ceased hostilities." Here, General Pétain stated in his radio address that France will continue to fight in Africa and the East. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London: French Premier General Pétain has just broadcast, saying, "We must abandon the war. We have asked the enemy for an honorable peace." (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London: France has surrendered to the German army today, and has ordered its troops to cease resistance to the German blitzkrieg tactics, which have penetrated the heart of France and surrounded one million good French soldiers in the Maginot Line. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Hitler's Headquarters: The Premier of the new French government, General Pétain, delivered a radio address to the French people this afternoon, stating that France has been forced to cease hostilities and has taken steps to notify the government of this decision and to inquire about Germany's preconditions for accepting France's request. Official sources here announced this afternoon that German leader Hitler will meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss the attitudes to be adopted by Germany and Italy. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

Berlin: Official documents here declared that General Pétain announced France's surrender. Hitler will meet with Mussolini to inform him of the results. (Haitong Agency urgent dispatch, 17th)

Berlin: Since the French Reynaud "War Cabinet" resigned, critical comments have been issued from German circles here, stating that "the French army is now in full control." They recalled that in 1918, Germany's surrender to the Allied powers was initiated by the German army. However, observers here are not willing to speculate whether the French government, headed by General Pétain, will beg for peace from Germany. This kind of request from Bordeaux must first be presented to leader Hitler, who is currently at the front. Germany has always demanded unconditional surrender from the countries it has declared war on. Observers here analyzed that Britain is "Germany's real enemy," so the peace terms Germany offers to France will be more lenient than those offered to Britain. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Pétain Sincerely Tells the Nation: The War Must End

Bordeaux: Premier Pétain broadcast to the French nation, "French compatriots, at the request of the President, I have assumed the responsibility of directing the French government from today onwards. My esteemed army, bravely fighting, those who are wounded and have lost limbs, will be cherished. I dare to assert that the army, during this glorious and upright war of resistance, has fulfilled our responsibilities to the Allied powers. I dare to assert that I, as the commander of those proud veterans, will assist them, and I dare to assert that the whole nation will trust them. I am now dedicated to France, in order to alleviate its suffering. The French people are gathered around the government. I am now the chairman of the government during this difficult trial. They should suppress their sorrow and only believe in the destiny of their country, and obey nothing else. I now tell you with a broken heart that the war must end. Last night, I personally wrote to the enemy, asking if he would meet with me in the manner of soldiers after a glorious battle, or seek a way to end hostilities. I think of those soldiers who faithfully uphold their old military traditions and confront enemies far exceeding them in number. I also think of the old comrades I commanded in the last great war. I have dedicated myself to France at this critical moment to improve its situation. At this moment, I think of the unfortunate men and women, the refugees, forced by the calamities of war, abandoning their homes, and wandering on the roads. I wish to express to them my most sincere sympathy and love." (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Franco to Serve as Mediator in Peace Talks

New York: News received here this morning from Europe indicates that after Hitler completes his encirclement of the Maginot Line, General Franco of Spain may serve as a mediator in the Franco-German peace talks. After General Pétain's new cabinet was established last night, the new foreign minister visited the Spanish ambassador. It is reported that Foreign Minister Baudouin presented secret documents to the Spanish ambassador, and then visited the British ambassador, presenting the same documents. It is generally speculated that the secret documents of the French Foreign Minister are to request the Spanish General Franco to mediate the Franco-German war. Observers believe that this document is related to France's request for peace from Hitler, and that General Pétain and General Franco served together in North Africa, and their friendship is quite deep. Observers firmly believe that if the French government decides to negotiate peace with Germany, General Pétain can request General Franco to be the mediator. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Britain Understands France, Will Fight Alone

London: Although no official statements have been issued yet, it is generally believed that Britain will continue to fight alone. The declaration of determination to fight to the end, issued by responsible parties last night, will remain in effect. The wording of the declaration stated, "Britain's firm determination to continue the struggle cannot be expressed in clearer and more practical terms."

People here are responding to the news of the French surrender with strong determination. There is no condemnation of France. It is acknowledged that France made this decision under oppressive circumstances. People are inevitably speculating about the future situation. Many observers believe that Germany's second step will be a peace offensive, or perhaps through some neutral intermediaries. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London: It is not yet known what kind of peace terms France can hope for from Germany. People here hope that the French navy will continue the war, because France is the world's second-largest naval power. It is also generally said that if the navies of Germany, France, and Italy unite, Britain will suffer an extremely serious threat at sea, making it easier for Germany to launch a rapid attack on Britain. Britain is now at war with two countries, Germany and Italy, and is facing a terrible war effort, with no support other than material aid from the United States. It is heard that France's surrender is partly due to the content of President Roosevelt's reply to the former French Premier Reynaud, because the French military situation has fallen into a very disappointing state, and only large-scale direct military intervention by the United States could enable the French government to continue to resist the German army. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

London: According to reports from British press circles, although France has surrendered, the British mainland and the entire British Empire will continue the war against Germany and Italy. It is heard that the British government will issue a detailed statement on France's decision to cease hostilities to clarify Britain's position. This statement may be announced tonight. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Bordeaux Port: According to official news, British troops are now arriving at the front lines in a steady stream, carrying fully equipped tank fleets. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### The News of the Armistice Spreads Like a Bolt from the Blue

London: General Pétain, the 84-year-old French hero who gained fame in the last European war for defending Verdun, assumed the post of Premier at one of France's darkest moments since 1870. Less than 24 hours later, he suddenly issued a radio address, saying that France had surrendered to Germany. Although there was speculation outside today that the new French government would make a major decision, no one initially expected France to take this step, so the public heard General Pétain's declaration as a bolt from the blue. Radio receivers here received General Pétain's broadcast saying, "We must cease fighting. We have asked the enemy for an honorable peace." Official confirmation from other sources has not yet been obtained here tonight. Urgent news has come from New York, saying that the National Broadcasting Company received General Pétain's broadcast declaring France's surrender to Germany, saying, "I have communicated with the German commander-in-chief at night. I announce with deep sorrow that we have ceased hostile actions." One hour before General Pétain's broadcast, it was learned here that the German army had advanced to the Swiss border. After the French army destroyed important fortifications of the Maginot Line, it withdrew from the line. It was also heard that the German army in the Paris area had advanced sixty miles southwest of Paris. It is not known where the British troops who rushed to France in recent days are now, but one hour before General Pétain's broadcast, it was still heard that the British army was fighting alongside the French army in Normandy. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

New York: After the initial news of the French surrender came, the American public was greatly shocked. Although the public's understanding of the serious situation in France has been increasing day by day, very few people expected it to take this step. Many Americans regret that they failed to provide more assistance to the Allied powers in the early stages of the war. One of the main speculative events at present is the future of the French fleet. If Britain continues to fight alone, what will happen to this powerful fleet? This is of great importance. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Editorial

### The European War Has Taken a Sharp Turn!

The French Reynaud cabinet resigned en masse, and exceptionally, the military figure General Pétain succeeded as Premier. The other cabinet members include Vice Premier Weygand, Minister of the Army Colson, Minister of the Navy Darlan, Minister of the Air Force Puech, and Minister of National Defense Coursault, all of whom are outstanding figures in the military. At a time when a strong enemy is oppressing the country and the nation is in danger, the immediate priorities of France are naturally how to deal with all external and internal problems. Under such circumstances, it is natural for the military to take power. However, one thing to note is that the French President should appoint members of the two houses of parliament as Premier. The ministers of the Navy and Air Force, although they can belong to the military, and the Foreign Minister, although he can be an administrative official or envoy, do not necessarily have to be members of parliament. However, the post of Prime Minister must belong to the leader of the majority party in parliament. Now, General Pétain is the Premier, which is truly an evolution in politics and a special exception since the establishment of the French Third Republic. French politics has always been complex, with numerous parties and intricate political views. Because a larger party is not enough to control parliament, the formation of a cabinet often involves a coalition of several parties. Therefore, the policies of any cabinet cannot be solely implemented by one party, but always compromise the political misfortunes of several parties. As a result, the cabinet's actions cannot be sufficiently firm and consistent, and the cabinet's life cannot be sustained. These two phenomena have a smaller impact in peacetime, but are inevitably felt to be unsound in wartime. At a time when the entire country needs to unite to face the outside world, it is natural for all parties to strengthen unity and stand under the same banner to cope with difficulties. The Clemenceau cabinet and the Poincaré cabinet in the past both took national unity as their slogan. However, their limits ended here, and there was no surpassing this nature to entrust the post of Premier to someone outside the political parties, like the appointment of General Pétain as Premier this time. From this alone, it can be seen how unprecedentedly serious the overall situation in France is.

The political instability of France did not start today; it had already shown signs at the beginning of the outbreak of the European War. For example, when the Daladier cabinet arrested members of parliament by military order, it was not only a political change, but its nature had already involved legal issues. When Daladier asked parliament to grant him greater power, he did not get parliamentary support and had to resign. After Daladier's resignation, the political power of the anti-communist parties was quickly transferred to the hands of the Democratic Republican Reynaud, which was the first shift to the right in power. The members of the Reynaud cabinet were reduced from thirty-five to eighteen, and the power of the cabinet was concentrated. Moreover, members from the left-wing Radical Socialist Party to the right-wing Croix-de-Feu participated in the cabinet. A national unity cabinet can be said to have achieved conformity between name and reality. Unfortunately, the concentration of political power was seen, but military blows came frequently. After the loss of the war at this time, the Reynaud cabinet was reorganized again, and General Pétain was removed from his position as Minister of National Defense. After only ten days of reorganization, the residual situation was handed over to Pétain.

As the reporter was writing this, news suddenly came that France had ordered an armistice. The detailed content has not yet been confirmed, but based on a comprehensive view of the situation from all sides, it was not absolutely unexpected that France, whose situation was so unfavorable that it could not be maintained, painfully ordered an armistice. We have not received sufficient information on this to provide a commentary. What we can say now is that the European War has taken a sharp turn. However, there are more than enough forks in the road ahead; this armistice may lead to peace, but a resumption of war is also possible. Even if that is not the case, it is not a matter of Germany winning and France losing, and everything belonging to the loser from now on belonging to the winner. How the fork in the road will lead is, of course, a matter in which the winner has a great say, but it is absolutely not something the winner can unilaterally decide everything. What will Britain do after France's armistice? This is the most pressing issue. What will be Germany's peace terms for France, and what will they be for Britain? This is the most important issue. Italy is fighting alongside Germany, but its wishes are not entirely the same. To what extent will the loser accept what Italy wants? To what extent will neutral parties outside the war, such as the Soviet Union, Spain, Turkey, and the United States, intervene for both sides? How will the naval power of Britain and France, and all the power of neutral countries, be used in determining another world in the future? All these points are key, and it is impossible to predict them at present. They will vary depending on the different evolutions. As for the Far East, it is neither integrated with the European war situation, and the nature of the problem is simple; not only can China, with its attitude of responding to all changes with constancy, overcome all encounters, but with the European war taking a sharp turn, it also allows this simple problem to be solved in the most reasonable way. Why? Because China's independence and integrity are in line with the wishes of the entire international community. Therefore, those who wrap up the news of the sharp turn in a comprehensive way must place themselves in the position of the East.

### French Troops Are Utterly Exhausted, Unable to Fight to the End

Bordeaux Port, France: General Pétain was recently ordered by President Lebrun to form a new cabinet, and the serious situation in recent days has entered a new stage. Since the 10th of this month, Premier Reynaud has twice telegraphed U.S. President Roosevelt, appealing for assistance. In his second telegram, he also stated that the enemy's combat troops totaled 150 divisions, the richest areas of France had been occupied, French troops had been fighting hard for many days and were extremely exhausted, and at the same time, they had to protect the Alpine border. From left to right, they continued to fight, but it was difficult to sustain. When the cabinet held a meeting yesterday morning, it presented the U.S. reply for discussion. According to this reply, although the United States was still providing material assistance, the situation was urgent, and France was in a state of emergency. Premier Reynaud requested that the United States provide France with thousands of aircraft, but it was difficult to know when these aircraft would arrive. At the same time, according to reports from the military authorities, the soldiers at the front had been fighting the enemy's entire army for two weeks and were already exhausted. Because of this situation, Premier Reynaud, who had always insisted on fighting to the end, had no choice but to resign, and the situation that was left behind was handed over to Pétain. Regarding the victory in Verdun during the last European war, British Ambassador Campbell visited Premier Reynaud and presented a telegram from British Prime Minister Churchill.

### A Million French Troops Surrounded Inside the Maginot Line

Berlin: German military circles reported last night that German troops had completed the encirclement of the Maginot Line. One million of France's most elite troops were still holding it at 8:00 last night (5:00 this morning, Shanghai summer time). German sources said that German artillery had controlled the roads that the French army had to take to withdraw from the Rhine and Saar fronts. The German High Command declared that German troops had reached a stronghold six miles from the Swiss border and 160 miles from the Italian border. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Paris: Hitler's powerful mechanized forces, advancing at a speed of fifty miles per day, are passing through France and advancing towards the Swiss border, attempting to completely surround one million of France's best troops defending the Maginot Line. As the German mechanized forces attacked the rear of the Maginot Line, the German army on the western front, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launched a fierce attack on the fortifications of the Maginot Line, whose battle line was one hundred miles long. The German army had crossed the Rhine River in several places, attempting to break through the Maginot Line, the purpose of which was to prevent the French army in the north of the Maginot Line from retreating south before the German mechanized forces operating in the Maginot Line reached the Swiss border. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

Stockholm, Sweden: According to a London radio broadcast last night, German troops have reached the vicinity of Dieden, eastern France. The German army west of Paris is doing quite well. The German army is advancing south from Paris, and the French army continues to retreat. The French army in Alsace and Lorraine has collapsed. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

Bordeaux: It is heard that the German side has deployed all its tank corps to assist the German army in launching sweeping operations from the east, west, and north, attempting to encircle the flanks of the Maginot Line. It is heard that part of the garrison of the line has withdrawn, and the French army on the Paris front is retreating south. The German army is not pursuing them, but is instead camping near Paris to defend it. According to a French radio reporter, the German side has only been able to achieve the war results of the past few days by taking advantage of its enormous superiority in troops and materials. The German High Command has deployed all its military force, totaling 150 divisions, to participate in the Western Front campaign, so the military force stationed in the German territory must have been reduced, and is only sufficient to maintain order in Poland. The German army in the Normandy area does not seem to want to continue to advance west, but is instead holding the line between Vernon and Chartres. The French army fighting on the Paris front has been able to withdraw without being harassed by the German side. Although Paris has been occupied, it remains safe and dignified. After the French army's positions in the Champagne area were broken through, the war situation became more serious. The German army in that area launched a fierce attack, breaking through the French army's positions in Chateaud Thierry and Montaigne Trelm, and advancing in all directions towards the Rhone River, the Seine River, and the Aube River, reaching the Sens and Troyes areas. The German army's offensive in the Aumont area was the fiercest, reaching Puttatel, and the area further north and east of Verdun, because after the German army broke through the Champagne front, it spread out in a fan shape. On Friday, the German army launched a fierce attack in Mermel, attempting to break through the French army's line of defense, but failed. The German army near Le Blanc Lesault launched another attack yesterday, but was repulsed to the other side of the river. However, some German troops have occupied a bridgehead.

### German War Report

Berlin. A German military expert yesterday gave a supplementary war report to the Haitong News Agency reporter, declaring that most of the French front lines had collapsed or were on the verge of collapse.

### Yichang City Lost and Regained, Chinese Launch General Offensive Near Jingzhou and Shashi, Remaining Japanese in City Completely Eliminated

Yichang. Starting from the 13th, fierce street fighting occurred between Chinese and Japanese forces in Dongguan, Yichang. On the 15th, the Chinese army implemented a new deployment, and the Japanese entered the city of Yichang, continuing to engage in bloody battles with the Chinese in the northwestern suburbs of Yichang. Seeing that the Japanese had penetrated deep into the city and had not yet established a foothold, the Chinese armies launched a general offensive that night from Jingzhou to Jingmen. By 10 PM on the 16th, Japanese corpses were scattered everywhere in Yichang, and the entire line collapsed. The Chinese army took advantage of the momentum to rush into the city and carry out a mop-up operation. By 3 AM on the 17th, the remaining Japanese had been completely eliminated. Yichang, once captured by the Japanese, was thus retaken by the Chinese army. (Telegram, 17th)

Yichang Battlefield. The Japanese army concentrated in the east-west area of ​​Dangyang was unable to move due to the Chinese army's pressure and encirclement. In the past two days, the Japanese have only tried to break through in small groups on the northeastern side of Dangyang, but have been repelled by the Chinese. The entire Chinese army is still using a large-scale encirclement deployment to gradually approach the Japanese positions from behind, and has entered the stage of main force engagement. (Telegram, 16th)

### Soviet Union Controls the Baltic Sea; Red Army Enters Latvia and Estonia; Warships Simultaneously Enter Riga Port; Latvia and Estonia Accept the Soviet Ultimatum to Reorganize Their Governments

Moscow: Regarding the relations between the Soviet Union and Latvia and Estonia, TASS has released the following announcement: On June 16th, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Molotov, representing the Soviet government, submitted a protest note to the Latvian envoy Guchins for transmission to the Latvian government. The protest note stated, "According to the information available to the Soviet Union, and the results of the conversation between Molotov and the Lithuanian Prime Minister Merkys, the Soviet government believes that the facts are extremely clear. The Latvian government has not only failed to cancel the military alliance with Estonia (which was established before the conclusion of the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty and was aimed at the Soviet Union), but has also further attempted to include Lithuania and even Finland in this alliance. Although this military alliance contradicted the Soviet-Latvian Non-Aggression Pact before the conclusion of the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty in the autumn of 1939, the Soviet Union could still ignore the existence of this military alliance. However, after the conclusion of the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty, the Soviet government believes that this alliance of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, aimed at the Soviet Union, is not only intolerable to the Soviet Union, but also threatens the security of the Soviet borders. The Soviet government originally expected that after the conclusion of the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty, Latvia would withdraw from the military alliance with other Baltic countries, thereby canceling the alliance. But Latvia has not only failed to do so, but has expanded the military alliance with other Baltic countries. This can be proven by the following facts: (1) In December 1939 and March 1940, the three Baltic countries convened two secret meetings, attempting to expand the military alliance. (2) The staff officers of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania intensified cooperation without letting the Soviet Union know. (3) In February 1940, the Baltic Small Entente published a journal called the 'Baltic Review,' which was printed in English, French, and German. The above facts prove that the Latvian government has violated the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty, because according to Article 4 of the treaty, neither party shall join any alliance aimed at the other party. Furthermore, this behavior that violates the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty is contrary to the Soviet Union's kindness and pro-Latvian policy, as well as the Soviet side's respect for the spirit of the treaty. The Soviet government believes that this situation cannot be tolerated. Latvia must implement the following conditions: (1) Latvia should immediately form a government that can abide by the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty. (2) Soviet troops may be stationed at various important points in Latvia, with a number sufficient to maintain the implementation of the Mutual Assistance Treaty and respond to any provocative actions. The Soviet government believes that this requirement is a prerequisite for implementation. On the same day, Guchins submitted the Latvian government's reply to the Soviet side, stating that the Latvian government fully accepts the demands made by the Soviet government. On June 16th, Molotov also submitted a protest note to the Estonian envoy Reis, for transmission to the Estonian government. The wording was the same as the Soviet side's note to the Latvian government. On the same day, Reis submitted the Estonian government's reply to the Soviet side, stating that the Estonian government fully accepts the conditions put forward by the Soviet government. (TASS dispatch from the 17th)

Berlin: According to sources, Latvia accepted the Soviet ultimatum last night and is forming a new government in Riga. The Red Army is scheduled to enter Latvian territory today. The Estonian government has officially announced that Soviet troops will enter Estonian territory "to be stationed in areas not yet garrisoned by the Soviet Union." The Estonian government has resigned after discussing the Soviet conditions. The Soviet side claims that the Soviet ultimatum to Latvia and Estonia stipulated that they must reply by 11:00 PM last night (5:00 AM Shanghai summer time today), otherwise, Soviet troops would automatically occupy the two countries at midnight yesterday. The Soviet demands do not require the Red Army to occupy all parts of Latvia and Estonia, but only to occupy the most important cities, similar to what the Red Army occupied in Lithuania last week.

Moscow: According to information relayed by the German Embassy in Moscow to the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, the former Lithuanian President and several key members of the Lithuanian government attempted to enter German territory last night and have been detained by the German authorities.

(Haitong Dispatch from the 17th)

Lithuania: After the Soviet Union sent additional troops into Lithuania, the Lithuanian president has departed the country. It is widely believed that he has resigned. After the Soviet side issued an ultimatum demanding the right to occupy Lithuanian territory and station a sufficient number of troops in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Prime Minister Merkys originally intended to resign, but is now acting as Prime Minister. The Lithuanian government has issued a statement saying that due to the international situation and the development of the war, it is necessary to increase the number of Soviet troops stationed in Lithuania to strengthen the security of Eastern Europe. The Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army has also issued an order calling the Soviet troops allied troops. Merkys broadcast last night, urging the Lithuanian people to make a correct judgment of the overall situation, saying that we believe that the arrival of another batch of Soviet troops in Lithuania is to ensure greater security for Lithuania and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the most important thing on our land at this time is to maintain peace and order. (Reuters Dispatch from the 17th)

Lithuania: The arrest of the Lithuanian Minister of Interior, Skucas, and the Director of the Political Police Department, Povilaitis, was one of the conditions in the Soviet ultimatum.

Lithuania: The capital of Lithuania has gradually returned to normal. Internal order is maintained by the Lithuanian police, and no unfortunate incidents have occurred. Although a large crowd gathered in front of the prison, they were dispersed after several people were arrested. There are no Soviet soldiers in the city, only the train station has been occupied by Soviet troops. Many tanks are parked near the station, and anti-aircraft guns have been erected. All the news published in Lithuanian newspapers is from TASS and the Lithuanian News Agency, and the topics of commentary do not go beyond this scope. (Haitong Dispatch from the 17th)

Lithuania: The commander of the Lithuanian capital's garrison issued an order last night strictly prohibiting people from walking on the streets after sunset. Taverns, restaurants, and entertainment venues must all close at sunset. Privately owned firearms must be handed over to the military authorities within forty-eight hours.

### Dutch East Indies Fears Japanese Invasion, Eagerly Awaits American Aid, While Also Seeking to Increase Trade to Eliminate Difficulties with Tokyo

Batavia: Today, people in the Dutch East Indies are very anxious about the possibility of Germany winning in Europe and Japan suddenly attacking from the south. The reality of these two possibilities is enough to force the relatively weak and powerless Dutch territory to seek protection immediately. At present, the only hope of the Dutch people here is to look to the United States for guidance and assistance. However, the 125,000 Dutch people who manage this vast tropical empire still have doubts about the extent of protection that the United States can provide to protect the status quo in Southeast Asia. The United States has a great need for the tin, rubber, and oil produced in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch people believe that this fact may lead the United States to provide assistance in the event of an invasion of the Dutch East Indies. Twenty percent of the world's tin is produced in the Dutch East Indies, and the United States is the largest customer of the Dutch East Indies. The United States has invested approximately $200 million in the Dutch East Indies' rubber industry, and American companies own 40% of the $300 million invested in the oil mines of Borneo. However, the number of Americans residing in the Dutch East Indies is very small. In Batavia, there are 60 Americans, half of whom are women and children. After the German invasion of the Netherlands, they were either evacuated to Australia or returned to the United States. The first terror that occurred here after Germany controlled the Netherlands was the fear that Germany would extend its power to the Dutch East Indies, because there are currently 7,500 Germans residing in the Dutch East Indies, and 400 of them hold positions in government agencies. Secondly, 10% of the Dutch people here are pro-German. When the news of the German invasion of the Netherlands arrived, the police quickly detained more than 5,000 Germans and some pro-Germans on a small island near Bavaria, Onrust Island, within three hours, and confiscated German property worth US$100 million. The German club in Bavaria became a temporary police station. The Dutch officials' handling of this matter was very agile. Of the 17 German ships docked in various ports of the Dutch East Indies, only one escaped, and the remaining 16 were detained by the Dutch authorities, with a total tonnage of 116,000 tons. After repairs, the detained German ships were re-flagged as Dutch and carried passengers. The detained Germans included members of the Nazi Party, non-Nazis, and Jews, all imprisoned in the same place. It is said that conflicts and riots often occur among these people. According to Dutch officials, some Germans have been executed by firing squad. Although the Dutch have eliminated the Germans, they still do not feel happy, because every Dutch person in the Dutch East Indies has family members in their home country. As traffic between the Dutch East Indies and the Netherlands has been cut off by the Germans, the Dutch people in the Dutch East Indies know nothing about the situation in their motherland. Therefore, the Dutch people here are all depressed and unhappy. Nightclubs are deserted, and there are few guests in the banquet halls. After eliminating the Germans, the second fear in the Dutch East Indies is the increasing possibility of Japanese invasion. The defense forces of the island, including Europeans, Eurasians, and local indigenous troops, total approximately 60,000 people. In addition, there are hundreds of American-style fighter jets, hundreds of coastal artillery pieces, several submarines, four cruisers, and destroyers. The Dutch authorities firmly believe that if they obtain foreign assistance, the current military force can temporarily prevent the advance of invaders before foreign assistance arrives. Several weeks ago, the rumors about Japanese activities subsided slightly, but now the Dutch people, while hoping for the victory of the Allied forces, are also trying to increase trade to eliminate difficulties with Tokyo, and feel that they are at a crossroads. The export goods of various European countries are no longer coming to the Dutch East Indies, and only products from the United States and Japan are available to supply these 60,000 residents, giving American and Japanese trade an excellent position. Merchants in Batavia, who have always traded with Europe, have had to change their plans and establish relationships with American manufacturers because they cannot import European goods. In the past, there were various restrictions on trade with the Dutch East Indies, and most commodities were monopolized by Dutch manufacturers. For example, according to government regulations, only Dutch manufacturers could sell radios in Java. Now this patent will be stopped, because the authorities strictly inspect newspapers, and people here are not restricted in their use of radios. In the past, German goods sold well here, but now they have been replaced by American and Japanese goods. Relations with the United States and Japan have become very close. From 1929 to 1934, Japanese exports to the Dutch East Indies accounted for 32% of the total imports of the Dutch East Indies, which was enough to satisfy its trade in the Dutch East Indies and was larger than that of the Netherlands. However, the Dutch East Indies' exports to Japan only accounted for 5% of its total imports. After 1934, the Dutch East Indies decided to increase the import of British and Dutch goods and suppress the import of Japanese goods. By 1938, Japan accounted for 15%. Today, business circles here believe that the European market in the Dutch East Indies will be replaced by American and Japanese goods as much as possible. If so, then on the one hand, it is an act of good neighborliness towards Japan, and on the other hand, it can hope for the friendly assistance of the United States.

### America Denies Joint Control of Vietnam with Britain and France; Eastern Newspaper Reports Britain and America Have Signed a Secret Agreement

Washington: Officials here are not commenting on the news reported by the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun that the United States has secretly negotiated with Britain and France on the issue of joint control of Indochina. However, well-informed sources do not believe this rumor. According to them, it is legally impossible for the United States to secretly negotiate with other countries on defense plans outside its own territory unless Congress grants this power. Judging from the repeated decisions of Congress in recent years, the policy of the United States is to firmly oppose all plans to infringe upon the Far East and to move towards clearing up the current infringements on the Far East, such as the rule of the Philippines. The US executive branch cannot independently engage in the defense of new areas abroad without the express permission of Congress. Well-informed sources also commented on the news reported by the Nichinichi Shimbun that Britain, America, and France will jointly defend Australia and New Caledonia, saying that regarding the defense of these two places, it seems too early given Britain's current intense engagement in war. The United States may consider establishing a permanent relationship with Australia, but any active action must be approved by Congress. (United Press Dispatch from the 17th)

Tokyo: A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that the news published in the "Nichinichi Shimbun" that the Japanese army in South China is determined to prevent the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from transporting military supplies to China is a fact. This decision to cut off the supply of military supplies is an absolutely necessary measure for the Japanese army, but the specific method to be adopted has not yet been announced. The spokesperson continued that whether to attack the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway at present will be decided by the Japanese military authorities in that area. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch from the 17th)

Tokyo: According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun," Britain and America have signed a secret agreement stipulating the joint defense measures for British and French territories and the Dutch East Indies in the Pacific. The newspaper claimed that, according to reliable sources, the Allied powers have suffered setbacks in the war in Europe and can no longer control their territories in the Pacific. These territories are in the same situation as the Dutch East Indies. At present, Britain and America have signed a secret agreement regarding these territories. Negotiations are also underway on the issue of joint British, American, and French management of Vietnam. The newspaper continued that the Japanese government should immediately pay attention to this development, and that Vietnam is important to Japan both geographically and economically. It goes without saying that Japan firmly opposes this joint management plan. Japan should immediately take diplomatic countermeasures. Vietnam's hostile attitude towards Japan has been proven by its actions in transporting military supplies to the Chinese government. Japan must demand that this hostile attitude be stopped immediately. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch from the 17th)

### Irish Parties Unite to Defend Neutrality Policy; Abandoning Prejudices to Protect Freedom

Dublin: The largest gathering in Dublin in many years was held yesterday inside the Irish university, demonstrating the country's determination to defend Ireland's neutrality policy with all its resources. The leaders of the three parties in the parliament, namely Valera, Cosgrave, and Griffiths, all addressed the assembled crowd, saying that all parties have abandoned prejudices and are now united as one party to protect Ireland's freedom. Valera said that the country is now facing an imminent danger, but the army has already been mobilized, and large numbers of recruits are enlisting in the army to protect freedom. The entire resources of the country must be used, supported by the courage and unity of the Irish people. Valera also said, "This danger is increasing its threat as time passes. When your neighbor's house is on fire, and sparks are falling on your roof, there is no time for much talk. We will have to suspend some government activities temporarily to prepare for self-defense. If your freedom has been taken away, then talking about freedom is useless." (Reuters Dispatch from the 17th)

### Syrian Muslims' Anti-Italian Movement

London: A Beirut dispatch from Syria states that Italy's entry into the war to help Germany has aroused the anger of Muslims and Arabs. On June 14th, thousands of Muslims at the Omar mosque in Beirut listened to the Imam describe the situation of Muslims being abused in Tripoli, Italian Abyssinia, and Albania.

The leader of the Syrian government declared that at this critical time, Arabs and Muslims are even more eager than before to stand on the side of the Allied powers, because they know that if the Allied powers unfortunately lose the war, they will suffer the same fate.

### British Ambassador Sir Kerr Arrives in Shanghai, Embassy Office Becomes Active, Decision on Whether to Go North for Summer Has Not Been Made

The news of Sir Kerr's arrival in Shanghai has attracted much attention. According to sources close to the embassy yesterday, the British Ambassador has come to Shanghai, and facts prove this. The British Embassy office in Shanghai is located on the Bund at the intersection of Beijing Road, on the upper floor of Jardine Matheson & Co. Whenever Sir Kerr stays in Shanghai, the police department will send two capable detectives to guard the entrance for the ambassador's safety. As long as the ambassador is in Shanghai, these special detectives will not leave.

Security Personnel Rediscovered

Since the ambassador went to Chongqing this spring, the Jardine Matheson building has been rather quiet, and even the traces of these two detectives have not been seen. The day before yesterday, it was suddenly reported that the long-departed ambassador had returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. The two detectives mentioned above near the embassy office were also discovered at the same time, so the saying that the ambassador had indeed arrived in Shanghai seemed even more credible.

Black Car Parked Simultaneously

The embassy office also has a small British car, which is used by embassy staff for transportation during the ambassador's stay in Shanghai. This car has not been seen on the Bund for several months, but yesterday morning, this black small car was refreshed and parked on the Huangpu Bund. This is another clear proof that Sir Kerr has arrived in Shanghai.

Decision on Going North for Summer Has Not Yet Been Made

The ambassador originally planned to stay in Shanghai for a short time and then go north to Beidaihe for the summer, but the situation in Europe is changing rapidly, and the future is uncertain. The ambassador's return to Shanghai this time is not solely for escaping the heat. The decision on his movements will depend on the development of the situation. It is recently heard that fewer British and French people are going to the northern summer resort than in previous years. In the precarious situation, they have no time to seek scenic beauty, and the ambassador probably feels the same way.

American Ambassador to Arrive Next Month

American Ambassador Johnson, after postponing his departure from Chongqing, is residing in the ambassador's private residence in Chongqing and is quite comfortable. According to news received from the US Consulate, Ambassador Johnson has now decided to fly to Hong Kong from Chongqing on July 4, and then transfer to the American President Lines' President Coolidge to Shanghai, arriving at the port on the afternoon of the 9th.

### French Concession to Increase Taxes, Decision Within the Week, Chinese Directors to Fight For

After the French Concession Municipal Council announced that it would increase various taxes from July 1 this year, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession believes that the Municipal Council's financial income in recent years has not been in deficit. Moreover, at a time when prices are soaring and people's livelihoods are difficult, increasing taxes will only further exacerbate the situation. They sent a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting that they withdraw the order, but they have not yet received a formal reply. It is now learned that the French Municipal Council has scheduled a board meeting within this week, at which the proposal will be discussed. It is reported that the Chinese directors of the French Concession have prepared to fight at the meeting and ask the authorities to consider the difficulties of the times and exempt them from increasing taxes in order to maintain the market. The French Ratepayers Association is also deeply concerned about the issue of rent control and has designated four representatives to cooperate with the authorities.

### Aftermath of Nanshi Refugee Zone, 19,000 Refugees Remaining, Short Time Limit for Dispersal of Younger Refugees

The quiet departure of Father Jacquinot de Bessenay, the founder of the Nanshi Refugee Zone, has attracted much attention from all sectors of society. Father Jacquinot's departure from Shanghai was purely out of his patriotic enthusiasm, as he hastily returned to his home country in response to a telegram from the charitable community to preside over relief affairs. Under the urgent circumstances of the retreat of the national army and the displacement of refugees, the Father resolutely established a refugee zone, and his kindness was universally respected by both Chinese and foreigners. It is understood that there are currently 88 ordinary shelters, 2 model shelters, 1 home for the disabled and elderly, 2 hospitals, and 2 schools for refugee children, with a total of more than 19,000 refugees still residing in the zone. The Supervisory Committee, originally organized by seven French priests and others in the zone, presides over the affairs of the entire zone, with the Father as its leader. Since the Father decided to leave Shanghai, a Follow-up Committee has been established to handle various follow-up matters. Before leaving, the Father also drafted a follow-up outline to be considered by the Follow-up Committee and the office. As of 2 pm yesterday, the Follow-up Committee had begun discussions, attended by Gu Lun, director of the Refugee Zone Office, and Jasper, the French Vice Consul in Shanghai. The French side advocated that from yesterday, younger refugees should be given half a month's worth of food, and they should be completely dispersed by the end of this month. However, Gu and others requested that the period for issuing food be extended to the 15th of next month so that the refugees would have the opportunity to find a way out after dispersal. It is heard that the dispersal date has not yet been agreed upon, but due to the lack of funds, the refugees will be given food and travel expenses, while the elderly and weak will be transferred to the Puyu Hall.

### Fire on S.S. Erebus, Loss of £1,000

The British Steam Navigation Company's regular ship on the China-India route, the S.S. Erebus, arrived in Shanghai from Bombay last Thursday with a large batch of cotton, a total of 22,300 bales, and docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload. On Saturday (the 15th) morning, while unloading, the cotton in the fourth hold suddenly caught fire. It was not extinguished until about 3 pm. The cotton in the hold that had not been burned was completely soaked in water, and the hold was overflowing with water that had not yet been drained. It is heard that the hull was also slightly damaged and will be moved to a certain pier in Pudong today to first remove the wet cotton and drain the water from the hold before repairing the hull. The ship's return to India will have to be slightly delayed. According to the shipowner's report to the company, the loss due to carelessness is valued at £1,000. The cause of the fire is unknown and is currently under investigation.

### 66 People Arrested in Hangzhou, According to Japanese Claims

According to Japanese claims, last month, the Japanese military police detachment stationed in Hangzhou cracked a major "spy organization," with as many as 66 people being reported. Among them, Yang Shilin, who had served in the military under the Zhejiang Security Office, recently joined the Hangzhou Japanese military police detachment and, with many companions, collected military and political information of the Japanese and puppet regimes to supply to the Chinese side, and planned to find an opportunity to assassinate important figures of the puppet regime. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was detected by the Japanese military police detachment. They began to search and arrest on the 25th of last month. As of the 28th, Yang and his companions arrested numbered 66.

### British Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, Mr. Rohde, Not Retired, Customs Authorities Deny, Rumors of Successor Even More Inaccurate

Yesterday, it was rumored that "British Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, Mr. Rohde, will have completed his 35-year term on November 22 of this year and will retire at that time." It was also said that the vacancy would be filled by one of Ding Guitang, Lu Bin, or British Azimut. Japanese Kishimoto Yoshihiro was also quite active for this position. Ping Ming News Agency reporters specifically inquired about this with the General Customs Administration and the Jianghai Customs, and both denied it. The Customs authorities stated that Customs Commissioner Rohde has no intention of retiring, and the so-called appointment by Ding Guitang or other Chinese or British personnel is even more inaccurate. Moreover, for example, the Customs Commissioner of Tianjin Customs had long been fulfilled his term, but continues to hold the position.

### Morning Bloodbath on Avenue Edward VII, Liu Ronggui Assassinated, Thugs Planned and Waited, All Three Bullets Hit Vital Spots, Died on the Spot, Liu was the Inspector-in-Chief of the Central Police Station's Shanghai East District C

A shooting occurred suddenly at about 8:15 yesterday morning near the tram station at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Petit, The victim was Liu Ronggui, Inspector-in-Chief of the Central Police Station's Inner District C, who died on the spot after being shot in vital areas. There were ten thugs, all of whom fled without a trace after the incident. Details are as follows:

Left Home Early to Wait for Tram

Liu Ronggui, Inspector-in-Chief of Shanghai East District C, also known as Youqing, was 52 years old, from Wuxi, and lived at No. 20 Wende Lane, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Petit. After the war, he was transferred to the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road. He was known to be forthright, frugal, and admirable. At about 8:15 yesterday morning, Liu was wearing a yellow uniform and black leather shoes, and as usual, he went to the police station for office work. He walked out of his house and took a few dozen steps to the tram stop at the intersection of Rue Petit, waiting for Tram No. 1 or 2. Unexpectedly, there were about ten thugs lying in ambush, dressed in various styles of long gowns and short jackets. Seeing Liu Ronggui approaching,

Thugs Surrounded Him and He Was Shot to Death

Six thugs rushed up and surrounded him. Four of them were wearing white silk shirts and pants and took out their guns to snipe. At that time, Liu was caught off guard and quickly pulled out his service pistol from his waist to fight back, but he had already been hit in three vital spots by ruthless bullets: one in the left temple, one in the right neck, and one in the back. The bullets did not penetrate, and he collapsed, blood gushing out like a spring. He died on the spot. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs fled in a swarm. By the time the nearby patrol officers heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, they were long gone. After being notified by neighbors, Liu's wife, Ms. Yu, together with his eldest daughter, Liu Suxia, a lawyer, rushed to the scene, mourning over the body with great grief, almost fainting.

Body Has Been Examined, Full Funeral Tomorrow

After the incident, the Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified and quickly dispatched a large number of armed detectives and troops to the scene to investigate and collect bullet casings, which were taken back to the police station for examination. The body of Liu was transported to the Shanghai International Settlement Police Hospital on Shanhai Pass Road. In the afternoon, a member was dispatched by the court to examine the body. It was then transferred to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. The grand funeral is scheduled for tomorrow (the 19th) afternoon. It is understood that after the incident, the police officers took a Cantonese girl, a maid living at No. 24 Wende Lane (who witnessed the murderer firing a gun), back to the police station for strict interrogation in order to find clues to track down the murderers.

Fair, Impartial, Diligent, and Outstanding

Liu had served in the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Force for 32 years, and he was valued by the authorities for his loyalty and diligence. At the age of 19, Liu graduated from the middle school department of St. John's University. On February 6, 1908, he was admitted to the Police Force as a translator and was assigned to the Yangshupu Police Station for 12 years. He was then transferred to the Old Gate Police Station for six years. He was twice transferred to the Criminal Court of the Mixed Court as a translator. On October 16, 1930, he was promoted to Inspector-in-Chief and served as Inspector-in-Chief in various police stations in Districts A, B, and C. He was fair, impartial, kind, and amiable. It is heard that the Police Force is deeply saddened by Liu's unexpected death and plans to provide generous compensation.

Six Children, All Grown Up

Liu left behind a small amount of savings, his wife, Ms. Yu, 49 years old, and six children. The eldest daughter, Suxia, is 29 years old, graduated from Shanghai Law School, obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree, and is now a lawyer, with her office located in a room downstairs.

Furthermore, since Italy's participation in the war, the situation in Europe has become even more dangerous. Therefore, the parcel route on which the Bureau relied to transport parcels to most European countries has been cut off.

### Rice Prices Rise Again, People's Food Supply Becomes Serious Again, Decision on Continuing to Provide Low-Priced Rice to Be Made Next Month

Rice prices in the city have risen again recently, and the problem of people's food supply has become serious again. Social stability is also threatened. If a solution is not sought quickly, the future is very worrying. According to inquiries from the Rice Industry Association yesterday, the city's rice reserves have always been abundant. However, taking advantage of the long exchange rate, rice merchants in the city have repeatedly ordered foreign rice, with the amount being between 300,000 and 400,000 bags in the past half month. They will be shipped to Shanghai successively in early July. The future of people's food supply is originally not a concern. It is only because it is being manipulated by others that it is difficult to effectively ban it.

Do Not Believe Rumors

To stabilize the rice market, in addition to cooperation between the authorities and the market to strictly ban speculators from entering the market, the greatest effectiveness is to not easily believe rumors. For example, recently in the market, there has been a so-called rumor that the inland areas are competing to purchase foreign rice from the city, which is actually groundless. Although rice prices in the inland areas are higher than before, the highest price per picul is about 50 yuan, while the lowest rice price per picul in the city is more than 50 yuan. There is no reason to purchase rice from the city. As for the Zhen rice in Zhejiang, as early as two months ago, only 5,000 bags were purchased from the city. After being transported to Ningbo, it was blocked by the Japanese and has been transported directly from the production area. If the rumor that the authorities have cancelled the price limit is used as a reason for the rise in domestic rice prices, it is even more wrong. A reporter inquired from relevant parties yesterday and learned that the authorities have not made such regulations. However, in order to encourage vendors to purchase as much as possible, they may consider their freight costs, but they will still strictly ban those who raise prices.

Low-Priced Rice Next Month

With rice prices rising so high, the general poor people are unable to afford to buy rice to feed themselves. In order to provide relief, it is imperative to rush to provide low-priced rice. Mr. Yu Qiaqing said that in order to rush to provide low-priced rice, various procedures are being actively carried out, and it has been decided to start next month. He will convene a meeting of the low-priced rice committee members next week to discuss the work in progress, but the amount of money required is huge, and he still hopes that all sectors will donate generously.

### Car Accident Causes Tragedy: One Man and Two Women Killed

A native of Ningbo, Xu Yuxiang, aged 25, used to work as a carpenter in Yuanlai. Recently, he came to Shanghai to seek a living, staying at his relative's home at No. 120 Sapo Sai Road in the French Concession. At 8:50 PM on the 15th, while crossing the road from north to south near No. 429 Xiafei Road near Luban Road, he was struck by private car No. 3918, owned by Dr. Qian Enze of No. 455 Lane 15 Jing'an Temple Road. The car was driven by the chauffeur Wu Yuting (age 42, from Tongzhou) at high speed. Xu was unable to avoid it and was knocked seven or eight feet away, falling to the ground. His left calf bone was crushed. Police officers arrived, sent Xu to Guangci Hospital, and detained the chauffeur in the police station. Xu succumbed to his injuries and died at 2:30 AM the following morning. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for examination. Yesterday, the authorities examined the body, and Xu Ruiyuan, the deceased’s uncle, claimed it. The defendant was sent to court by the police for legal proceedings.

Wu Yushu, the manager of the Jiaotong Bank branch at No. 678 Haig Road, owned private car No. 909. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, it was driven by chauffeur Xie Ronghua (age 35, from Chongming), speeding westwards along Fuxu Road near Guba Road and Hede Road. In front of No. 1085, a woman in her twenties was crossing the road. Both parties were unable to avoid each other, resulting in the woman being knocked down and her head and waist crushed, causing immediate death. Police officers arrived, detained the chauffeur, and sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for examination. Yesterday, the authorities examined the body, but since they were unable to ascertain the identity of the deceased, the body was handed over to the Charity Hall for burial, pending identification by relatives. The defendant was sent to court by the police for legal proceedings.

Madam Chen Luo, an elderly woman from Jiangbei, aged 70, lived at No. 700 Xiaoshadu Road. At around 7:30 PM last night, while walking alone at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Xinzha Road, she was suddenly struck by a speeding transport vehicle of unknown number. Unable to avoid it, she was knocked down on the spot, fatally crushing her head, resulting in immediate death.

### Gangsters Assault and Wound a Fake Policeman and Foreman

Xu Qingquan, aged 29, from Anhui, is the foreman of the Tongli Towel Factory at No. 4 Ye Qin Village, Dunxin Road, in Western Shanghai. He has been working at the factory for three years. The area is located outside the concession boundaries, and gangsters are rampant, engaging in robbery and extortion. Two gangsters from the neighborhood came to the factory on the 16th (the day before yesterday) to demand festival fees and were given ten national currency dollars, after which they left. The next day, they returned to the factory, demanding more money. A fake policeman named Gao, who was on guard duty, prevented them from entering, and they held a grudge. Yesterday afternoon, the gangsters returned with accomplices, armed with handguns, axes, iron rods, and other weapons, waiting at the factory entrance. When the fake policeman Gao went on duty, they used the axe handle to strike Gao's head and face. Xu was standing and watching during the assault when one of the gangsters struck him on both legs twice with an axe, and once on his left arm, causing profuse bleeding. It is reported that two of the assailants were apprehended on the spot and taken to the fake police station for investigation. The injured Xu Qingquan was hired a car and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Continue to Plummet: Speculation Leads to Suicide; Ding Chunfang from Wuxi Loses His Life

Ding Chunfang, a native of Wuxi, aged 34, residing at No. 24 Rongkang Villa, Shantieh Road, was a cotton yarn merchant. Recently, due to speculation in cotton yarn, prices continued to plummet, resulting in losses of over 300,000 yuan, leaving him bankrupt and heavily indebted. Overwhelmed by remorse, Ding contemplated suicide. Yesterday morning at around 2:00 AM, he suddenly ingested raw opium in an attempt to take his own life. When his family discovered it, they rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but the poisoning was too severe, and he died at around 3:00 AM this morning. After the examination yesterday, the body was moved to the Leyuan Funeral Home for preparation. This is truly a warning to speculators.

### Father Jacquinot's Departure Thoughts

— Zhao Weiqian

One or two days before the fall of Paris, there was news that Father Jacquinot was preparing to leave Shanghai and return to his country. Unfortunately, the French army retreated, and the German army had already entered the bustling city of Paris. Although the French expatriates in Shanghai encouraged each other via radio with "Don't be discouraged, don't lose heart," a picture of refugees in exile had already been placed before us.

A Reuters Air Force correspondent said: He drove over fifty miles through a sea of people and witnessed the refugee population like a tidal wave. The endurance of these refugees is admirable... Although the refugees' eyes showed exhaustion, there were few tears. Children sitting amidst boxes and clutter often showed smiles, as if to indicate that they did not feel pain from this long journey. The elderly were sleeping due to exhaustion, their wrinkled and resolute faces seeming to maintain determination even in their sleep. The vehicles driven by the refugees mostly carried two items: one was straw mats, to serve as bedding when there was no place to stay; the other was a bicycle, to temporarily replace the car when it broke down or the horses became too tired.

Father Jacquinot was kind and compassionate. During both the January 28th Incident and the August 13th Incident, he provided aid to Chinese refugees, truly a "living Buddha" with universal praise. Now, the refugees of France—Father Jacquinot's compatriots—were running along the exile line, struggling at the forefront of the war. Father Jacquinot could not remain unmoved. Encouraged by the French authorities, he resolutely and silently bid farewell to his second hometown of China and tens of thousands of beloved refugees. He quietly boarded a ship from the Huangpu River to cross the West to the United States of America, and then returned to the embrace of France, "born here, fed here, grown here." Temporarily abandoning the refugees in the East, he devoted himself to comforting the refugees in the West. Undoubtedly, this was all due to the war, keeping a peace envoy extremely busy, running east and west. He was already a sixty-seven-year-old man with white hair!

During this Sino-Japanese War, Father Jacquinot went to the refugee camps every day to work, until the day before his departure. His departure was hasty. While packing, he still handled many affairs: the most important was the issue of refugee resettlement. Originally, due to severe financial constraints, the number of refugees in Nanshi was gradually decreasing. After Father Jacquinot's departure, the elderly and weak refugees would temporarily be cared for by the Xin Puyu Hall as usual, while the young and strong refugees would be encouraged to seek a living, and they would be given half a month's rations. Refugees are the most sympathetic people in the world because they know that what is most needed in hardship is the sympathy and comfort of others. Father Jacquinot's work over the past few years can be described as benevolent and righteous. How could the refugees not be moved? They prepared to erect a bronze statue of Father Jacquinot to commemorate him forever. Therefore, on Saturday morning, each person held a brick and first held a solemn cornerstone laying ceremony for the bronze statue. They also wanted to change Fangbang Road in the city to Jacquinot Road, and Fangbang Bridge to Jacquinot Bridge, to commemorate his departure thoughts. However, they were powerless, lacking both financial resources and influence. To put these noble ideals of honoring virtue and repaying kindness into practice would have to wait for another day. Among the refugee children was a boy named Lin Yusheng, who was exceptionally intelligent. Father Jacquinot often loved to chat with him in Shanghai dialect during his spare time. Recently, due to his imminent departure from China, he donated ten yuan to the Xushi Bank as his education savings. Gu Lun, Father Jacquinot's private secretary, had a teacher-student relationship with Father Jacquinot at Aurora University. In recent years, his assistance in charity work has been tireless. Therefore, Father Jacquinot regarded him as a right-hand man and gave him a photo with a few sentences inscribed on it: "You contribute to God and the motherland, exerting your intelligence to the fullest. You are worthy of being my left hand!" In these few words, it can be seen that Father Jacquinot was sincere, easily grateful to others, and also very humorous, because he himself lost an arm and only had a right hand, hence "worthy of being my left hand."

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War in 1937, Father Jacquinot established the Nanshi Refugee Zone, which was highly valued by both the Chinese and Japanese sides. Later, with the advancement of North America, he aroused the sympathy and attention of the American people, benefiting refugees throughout the country. As a result, relief efforts were able to proceed smoothly. The Chongqing National Government, recognizing Father Jacquinot's contribution to humanity and culture, recently presented him with a sapphire-colored jade medal, which Father Jacquinot regarded as a great honor and often wore. Father Jacquinot said to his friend yesterday: "China is my hometown, I deeply love China. Although I am temporarily returning to Europe this time, I will return soon." He recently changed his name from "Jacquinot" to "Jacquinot Hua," words from the heart. We know his motive for changing his name based on the meaning of the name. He is indeed an international friend who deeply loves China.

### Young Woman Pregnant, Accuses Timber Merchant of Abandonment, Demands 67,200 Yuan; Defendant Claims to be the Woman's Adoptive Grandfather

Cai Junfu, a wealthy timber merchant from Chaoyang, Guangdong, aged 52, residing at No. 3, Lane 222, Malong Road, operates timber businesses in both Caojiadu and Tianjin, also engaging in transportation and purchasing, and possessing considerable assets. Recently, Cai Li Cuiying, a young woman from Sichuan (age 20), retained lawyer Li Wenjie and filed a criminal complaint in the Second Special District Court, accusing him of

Abandonment and neglecting her living, requesting that he be punished accordingly. She also filed a civil suit. The case was heard by judge Zhang Mingsheng yesterday. The plaintiff was unable to appear in court due to childbirth and was represented by her lawyer, who stated the plaintiff's case, roughly as follows: The plaintiff went to Tianjin in September last year to visit relatives and resided in a hotel. She met the defendant, who was doing business in Tianjin, residing in the same hotel. They became acquainted, and the defendant, admiring the plaintiff's youth and beauty,

Under his sweet words and enticements, they formally began cohabitating in the defendant's shop on Zhengxing Street in the Chinese area of Tianjin in September of last year. In March of this year, she accompanied the plaintiff on the Yihua Company's Dingsheng ship to Shanghai, first residing at the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road. Later, because the plaintiff was about to give birth, he rented the remaining house of lawyer Wu Huatai at No. 4 Meilanfang, Belle Road. The lease stated that the plaintiff was the defendant's family member. After moving in, everything was peaceful, but not long after, the defendant

Disappeared and did not return. She inquired everywhere and learned that the defendant resided at No. 3, Lane 222, Malong Road and had telephone number 83305. She telephoned to inquire about the defendant's whereabouts. She happened to speak to him and questioned him, but he prevaricated. He still did not come. She then hired a lawyer to send a letter questioning him, but he ignored it. The plaintiff is a young and weak woman, far from home, and after being violated by him, he maliciously abandoned her. In

Amidst grief and anger, she suffered a miscarriage while seven months pregnant (the issue of the infant is temporarily reserved). The defendant abandoned her, which is unforgivable in both law and morality. Reluctantly, she requested that he be punished according to the law and also requested in the civil suit that he be ordered to pay 67,200 yuan (280 yuan per month, calculated for 20 years). The defendant arrived in court with his defense lawyer and stated that he met the plaintiff in November of last year at the

Paris Hotel in the French Concession of Tianjin. He went there with friends to play cards. In March of this year, the defendant came to Shanghai on the Dingsheng ship. After arriving in Shanghai, because they were a single man and woman, it was inconvenient to rent a house. She recognized me as her adoptive grandfather and asked for help, etc. The court verified the statements and ordered the plaintiff to appear in court for interrogation and announced a new date for the hearing.

### Silk Merchant Zhang Shengliang Obstructs a Family, Cohabits with a Female Student; The Woman's Mother Reports the Arrest

Zhu Yu, a woman from Pudong, originally lived in her hometown. After the outbreak of the war, she brought her seventeen-year-old daughter Zhu Jingwen to Shanghai to seek refuge two years ago, residing at No. 13 Zhengyuan Lane, Bei Di'ao Road in the French Concession. To become self-sufficient, Zhu Jingwen enrolled in the Dade Obstetrics Hospital at the intersection of Gordon Road and Xinzha Road,

Studying obstetrics, initially leaving early and returning late, and then living in the hospital. In August of the year before last, Zhang Shengliang, a silk merchant from Jinhua, Zhejiang, who worked for an English company, aged thirty-one, met Zhu by chance at the intersection of Gordon Road and Weihaiwei Road on Mulming Road. He began to pursue her, following her every day and teasing her. Over time, feelings grew, and one day they rented a house at No. 34 Yilixi Lane, Gordon Road, and began cohabiting. It has been over a year now. Recently, the woman's mother, Zhu Yu, discovered this secret.

She reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station the day before yesterday. Detective Zhang Xuejian was dispatched to arrest Zhang Shengliang and brought him and Zhu Jingwen to the police station. Zhang was detained, and the woman was taken back by her mother. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin, representing the police station, prosecuted him under Article 240, Section 3 of the Criminal Law and presented the case. According to Zhu Jingwen's complaint, she was seduced and cohabited with Zhang and repeatedly urged him to hold a wedding, but he always avoided it. Zhu Yu then filed

A civil suit, requesting compensation of 10,000 yuan for emotional distress. When questioned, Zhang Shengliang admitted to cohabiting with Zhu, but said that her mother, Zhu Yu, agreed to this, and the woman's sister wrote a cohabitation agreement, which Zhu Yu signed. The agreement is currently kept in a bank safe deposit box and will be submitted at a later date. This incident occurred because his brother and sister-in-law failed to get a loan, etc. After hearing the statements, the judge ordered Zhang to be detained and adjourned the case for seven days for further investigation.

### Yanjing University in Peiping Decides to Establish a Middle School in Hong Kong: Site Found, School May Open in the Autumn

(Hong Kong Correspondence) Yanjing University in Peiping has decided to establish a middle school in Hong Kong. Xu Dishan, Ma Jiming, Xu Wanjun, Chuan Shishi, Ye Xiuying and other alumni of Yanjing University in Hong Kong are actively preparing for it. According to Mr. Ma Jiming, the plan to establish a secondary school in Hong Kong by Yanjing University was originally based on the opinions provided by the president of the university after he visited Hong Kong and the interior a month ago. It is currently under preparation. The Hong Kong side is currently planning to find a school site in the New Territories, but so far there is no suitable location. If the school site is found before the summer vacation, it may be possible to open the school in the fall. In terms of funding, it is planned to raise HK$10,000 from alumni of the school and philanthropists in Hong Kong for start-up expenses. Currently, it is only planned to run the first year of junior high school and senior high school. If possible, the second and third years of senior high school will be continued. In terms of curriculum, it is proposed to focus on teaching students light industrial skills so that after graduation, when they are no longer pursuing further studies, they will be able to take on the roles of middle-level cadres between industrial engineers and workers. The tuition fee will be as low as possible in order to benefit students with lower economic capacity, so that they also have the opportunity to enroll. It is also learned that Yanjing University has been recruiting new students in Hong Kong every year. This year, due to some special circumstances, it has been decided to stop recruiting new students, but Shanghai will continue to hold recruitment as usual.

### Cotton Yarn: The July Double Horse Yarn Contract Opened Yesterday, Boosting Bullish Sentiment

The cotton yarn market has turned calm and is showing signs of price increases. This is due to the rebound in overseas cotton markets, coupled with a decrease in the U.S. dollar exchange rate, which has stabilized sentiment. Short sellers have been actively covering their positions. Simultaneously, there is consistent demand for coarse yarn from Hong Kong, providing support for market traders. The July Double Horse yarn contract price has been released at 1,230 yuan, which has reassured bullish traders who can now hedge for the next month. However, eager buyers are not yet evident, resulting in limited transactions.

In morning trading, news of a decrease in foreign exchange rates and a simultaneous rise in Indian and American cotton prices have invigorated the previously sluggish sentiment. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn initially rose to 1,150 yuan, then to 1,190 yuan. Subsequently, profit-takers emerged, causing the price to fall back to 1,160 yuan. By the close of trading, the market was boosted again by rising gold prices and positive sentiment, pushing the price up by more than ten yuan. Statistics show that 1,615 lots were traded during the half-day session. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 43 yuan. Today, 35 bales of cotton yarn were shipped out, with 690 bales going to Hong Kong. The distribution of purchases by various trading groups is listed below:

Domestic traders: 1,275 bales; Xiamen: 5 bales

Hong Kong: 355 bales; Ningbo: 20 bales; Total: 1,615 bales

400 Bales of Indian Cotton Traded

Transactions of domestic cotton have ceased, but Indian cotton trading is relatively active. Japanese factories have made a substantial purchase, and trading among domestic traders has also shown slight activity. This is because overseas Indian cotton markets are rising across the board, improving market conditions. However, business has not yet fully taken off. The current cotton transaction details are listed below:

Amra: 198.00 yuan; Donghua Trading: 100 bales

Dholera: 217.00 yuan; Tongbang Trading: 100 bales

Surat: 215.00 yuan; Qingsheng Trading: 100 bales

Broach: 203.00 yuan; Domestic Trader: 100 bales

In other news regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market has shown remarkable strength recently. At the start of the day, speculative buying and short covering activity drove prices up. As a result, closing prices were more than ten points higher than the previous day. Indian cotton prices also rose significantly due to improved sentiment and buying from European exporters. Overall forecasts indicate an increase of eight rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market has recently benefited from the rising overseas cotton prices and a gradual tightening of exchange rates, resulting in positive sentiment. Spot transactions are limited, but there are still sporadic deals. Overall, market participants believe that market conditions are improving and that cotton prices will likely rise without falling.

### Piece Goods: Inland Cloth Sales Gradually Increasing

The cloth market is stable due to the firmness of raw material yarn and cotton. With the successive arrival of local produce such as tea and silk from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, demand for cotton cloth is gradually increasing. As a result, the downward trend in cloth prices has slowed down. Yesterday, the general cloth market was stable, with retail prices still one to one and a half jiao cheaper per piece. Wholesale shops in this street purchased over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, poplin, foreign yarn, and bleached cloth. Traders from the Wenzhou and Ningbo areas of eastern Zhejiang bought foreign yarn. Cantonese traders purchased fifty to sixty boxes of colored cloth and colored twill. Nearly 2,000 bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and bleached twill were purchased for export to Singapore and other countries.

The Eastern Cloth Market is showing increasing strength. This morning, White Dragon Fine Cloth opened at 35.50 yuan per piece. Subsequently, due to a drop in gold prices, it fell to 35.05 yuan by noon. In the afternoon, as market sentiment favored bullish positions, some traders believed that the downward trend was slowing. Consequently, there was less selling, and White Dragon Fine Cloth closed at 35.25 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" cloth was priced at 9.125 fen per yard.

Piece goods exports on the 16th included 219 pieces to Hong Kong, 152 pieces to Singapore, 20 pieces to Sluis, and 40 pieces to . Shipments on the 18th included 45 pieces to Xiamen, 300 pieces to Weihaiwei, 95 pieces to Yantai, and 30 pieces to Tianjin.

### Sugar and Cloth: Foreign Sugar Stable

Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat. The guild set the price for spot 24 Raw White sugar at the foreign warehouse at 70.50 to 70.70 yuan in the morning and returned to 70.50 yuan in the afternoon. Re-export goods were priced at 56.40 to 56 yuan.

Dutch red sugar was priced at 59.40 yuan. Domestic sugar from the Cantonese group offered 50 bags of Haikou ice sugar at 63 yuan and 113 bags of Nanjiang green sugar at 68 yuan. A trader with a land permit from the Jianbang group offered 400 bags of Zhangdiao green sugar arriving on Taikoo ships at 63.50 yuan and sugar arriving on Japanese ships at 63 yuan. Additionally, 229 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Silk and Tea: Inland Silk Merchants Cannot Come to Shanghai

Since last year, Shanghai silk mills have been subject to controlled raw material prices. This spring, many mills have shifted their investments inland to set up small silk factories. However, unfortunately, most of these small silk factories are located in occupied areas and are thus still controlled by the "administration." It is recently learned that the puppet regime, under the guise of "construction" donations, will levy a 12% tax on raw silk transported to Shanghai. Considering that each bale of factory silk is valued at 1,000 yuan, each bale will have to pay 300 yuan. Therefore, inland silk merchants can no longer come to Shanghai.

The local silk market has suspended cargo transactions. Chinese silk merchants have now deeply realized the importance of the relationship between the nation and commerce.

Yesterday, Hengyun spot was priced at 1,550 yuan, near-term at 1,560 yuan, and far-term at 1,586 yuan. With New York closed for the week, the local silk exchange was quiet.

### Green Tea Declining Gradually

Yesterday, the foreign tea market saw each merchant house and trading firm considering the increasingly severe European war, which made business more brisk. The entire market, including firms such as Xiehe and Tongshou, imported over 180 boxes of new and old Chun Mei green tea. New goods were priced from 265 to 280 yuan, while old goods were priced at 135 yuan, a drop of 20 to 30 yuan compared to previous prices. The market for high-end Chun Mei tea remained sluggish.

Additionally, 526 bales of tea were shipped to Singapore and 15 bales to Western Asia the day before yesterday (16th). Yesterday, 500 bales of tea arrived from Hong Kong and 574 bales from Wenzhou. Today, 145 bales are being shipped to Xiamen and 500 bales to Tianjin.

### Metals: Deformed Steel Bars Decline

The trade in deformed steel bars has become extremely sluggish, with prices falling continuously, after the sharp decline in the orders of traders from other ports, coupled with a small amount of business being handled by the building agencies in the street. The market sentiment is unstable. The spot price had already fallen from 1,430 yuan to the 1,400 yuan level. The prices for specifications from five-tenths to one inch also dropped from 1,380 yuan to the 1,350 yuan level.

### Waking Up the Prostitute, Huang Ying'er (3)

Passing is difficult, the "Bai Xiang" people [those who frequent prostitutes] need to pass the checkpoints. The family delivers gifts, carrying them on poles through the streets, a basket of snacks, a basket of fruit, plus ham and preserved eggs. During that time, a pile of debt urges you to pay it back soon. Or you meet someone you like, and you love her youth, and you believe everything she says. You are infatuated, and she is affectionate, and you wholeheartedly want to settle down for life. Without taking a formal title, the money is used up, and everything comes to nothing. It can be considered affectionate, marrying her home properly, but she has always been loose and restless. She doesn't get along with family, doesn't agree with neighbors, and her extravagance and indulgence are even worse than before. It doesn't work out, the family fortune is emptied, and she is still divorced and disgraced. Wandering is never suitable. When you meet a lover, money is like mud. Even if you use up a thousand gold, it's hard to get your wish. She doesn't know good from bad, doesn't distinguish high from low, and calls a rich man her confidant. Like a fox, she is willing to deceive, even immortals and Buddhas are confused. There are also those who turn back, saying they will quit from tomorrow, making endless vows in front of people. But as soon as they see their friends, they can't control themselves and rush back to the old path. It's hard to give up; the endless entanglements are a fishhook in life. Extreme joy turns to sorrow; in the end, you are not free. The prostitute casually betrays your good intentions. At first, it's romantic, but gradually it becomes depraved. Proper relatives and friends are alienated. Without other plans, what else can you do but steal? As the days go by, money becomes scarce, and regretting the past is in vain. It's hard to face the elders at home. Today on the roadside, tomorrow on the street, their inherent character is base and cheap. Who will pity them? How can they survive the cold and hunger?

### Starting with "Being Detached"

— Yan Yisong

I happened to flip through "Three Hundred Tang Poems" and read three poems from Li Bai's "Hard Roads." Below the last two lines of the final poem, "Enjoy a cup of wine before I die, why bother with a thousand years of fame after death?" the commentator notes, "See how detached the final two lines are."

The common Chinese mentality is either to like being detached or to like groaning. Groaning doesn't necessarily mean one is sick; often, even without being sick, people groan in sorrow and misery. Writers are among the best at this. Therefore, most articles, poems, or lyrics are either "Don't let the golden goblet face the moon empty" or have a horizontal line of "How sad" and a vertical line of "Alas." Because without these, the work seems bland and tasteless. Although there are exceptions, they are only a very few.

This trend has continued to this day. Some people have risen up to resist it, but without much effect. So, for a while, "immersion" style novels were particularly popular, and works about romance, pleasure, and drinking were also well-received. But the unlucky ones were not the authors of these works, but the readers who were deeply influenced by them, especially young people!

We know very well that everyone feels sadness and pain at times, but we believe that merely lamenting and crying out is completely useless. We also know that everyone should be detached, but we believe that a kind of passive detachment is unacceptable. Passive detachment is another way of expressing sadness and pain, but instead of "Ai ya" and "Ai ya" groaning, it uses pleasure, romance, and drinking to seek temporary numbing and forget all the pain, if there is really any pain.

This kind of passive detachment causes losses that are greater and more tragic than merely groaning and crying.

Sadly, in China, this kind of detachment is extremely popular. Taking Shanghai as an example, restaurants and bars are packed with people, and dance halls and game halls are overflowing.

However, the generally idle writers don't seem to care, and they are spreading their poison as much as possible, fearing they are not doing enough.

Friends, don't be fooled anymore. I sincerely advise you, they are groaning without being sick to express pain, don't follow them to be in pain. They are luring you into the trap of pleasure and drinking to get a little detached, you must never go! If you really encounter something sad and painful, don't just shout or seek numbness, you must find a way to overcome it. A person doesn't necessarily need a thousand years of fame after death, but it's enough to live with some meaning. Although the road is hard, you have to walk it, and you won't fail to reach your destination.

This can also be called detachment, but in another way, actively, not passively.

### The Stubbornness of Life

— Lei Xing

After reading a biography written by a tramp, I gained many thoughts and lessons. My fantasies roamed on the roofs of American trains and in the forests; I also seemed to see a man with a prosthetic leg begging and selling lace in European villages and towns.

Can you imagine? A tramp spent years and months of his life in the Americas and Europe, and broke a leg; but in the end, he became a poet - a poet praised by George Bernard Shaw and other great critics. Who gave him courage and perseverance? What spurred a cripple to devote himself to writing verses? The God in the mouth of the pastor, the lover in the mouth of the knight? Neither. I say it is a stubbornness of life.

Stubbornness has been criticized, because our society needs "great men" who can be both rounded and squared. However, the reason why mankind has not been destroyed and the nation has not perished is precisely because of the stubbornness of our ancestors.

In ancient times, mankind fought against cruel nature; today, it is different - I mean the objects are different, the struggle never changes. In great suffering and pain, we strive for survival and sunny days, and we shout out a cry that resounds through the clouds: We want to live.

What runs through a colorful life is the stubborn will to live. Remember that this is not just clinging to life; to live under coercion and wealth is the base act of cowards and weaklings. On the contrary, the stubbornness of life is battle and struggle, and it is endless.

Living is always lovely, but the meaning of living is not just about sustaining life; we all have to eat, because we are not gods but people, but more importantly, we have to "be human -" because we are threatened with being unable to be human. The power that supports resistance to the situation of being treated like cattle and horses is precisely the stubbornness of life.

### The City of the Red Cross

— Ling Shuang

Only a few miles from the Maginot Line, in a military area full of fortifications, is a French town called Phalsbourg, the most non-military town in the world. There are no machine guns, rifles, or pistols in the town; no anti-aircraft guns to protect small bridges; and no markings or sandbags for air-raid shelters. At night, the lights in the town reflect in the sky, brighter than usual. The tools of war are rumbling all day long—tanks, ammunition boxes, soldiers, horses, trucks. But the unarmed sentries in the town order them to go elsewhere. If active soldiers want to enter this town, they can only be carried in on a stretcher.

Because Phalsbourg is the capital of the Red Cross; General Schikele of France proposed to establish a Red Cross zone to spare the wounded the horror of being bombed, and this town is the first major humanitarian experiment. At the International Red Cross Conference in 1932, General Schikele proposed that in future wars, small towns with no military value should be handed over to the Red Cross for use, with the combatant countries guaranteeing absolute safety. Germany, France, England, and several other countries expressed their support; the agreement to be passed in 1939 was not signed, but France established the City of the Red Cross according to the set plan.

The roofs of the town's hospitals are all painted with obvious markings; the town's square is also painted with a large red cross. The authorities have made extensive publicity about the nature and location of this town. The extent to which this experiment can succeed will depend on Germany's attitude towards this agreement. So far, everything is going very smoothly.

### Health Training

— Competition

We must reduce the time spent eating and drinking and contemplate more.

When going out, instead of riding, it's better to walk leisurely.

Don't be too particular about clothing, the important thing is to wash and clean your body.

Don't worry unnecessarily, work more.

It's better to play than to waste time idly.

Speak less, pay more attention to thinking.

Waste less, produce more.

Don't get angry and scold people for no reason, always wear a smile.

Don't talk empty words, do more practical things.

Hawthorn Detective Case

### The Prima Donna's Fate

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 1 "A very pretty lady!"

The iron box that Hawthorne spoke of was to the left of the recliner. The box was rectangular, painted in light blue, and in terms of style and color, it looked like a radio. In the corner by the window, there was a bookshelf. In fact, calling it a bookshelf would be an "accusation." Because there were no books on the shelf, except for a few picture magazines and newspapers like those on a desk, most of it was empty. Against the back wall, there was another three-dimensional dressing table, on which cups, saucers, wine bottles and the like, were all foreign goods. On the wall east of the dressing table hung an oil painting in a wide gold frame, three feet long and two feet high, also depicting foreign scenery. In short, the impression given to me by all the objects in the room was nothing but extreme "luxury" and "wastefulness," forgetting the era and the country!

Hawthorne took the key and walked to the iron box, carefully sliding open the round keyhole cover on the box door, inserting the key, which fit perfectly. He simply turned the key and opened the box door handle as well, casually pulling it open. Inside there were also three or four stacks of bundled legal tender. Before he could begin to examine the contents of the iron box, he suddenly heard a burst of coughing. He quickly closed the door of the iron box, turned around, and greeted the person who used the coughing sound as a prelude.

At this time, Ni Jinshou had led the deceased's uncle, Li Zhiban, in.

### Clark Gable

— Film

He was very clever from a young age, and his acting experience came from school. Because during his school days, when the school held entertainment events, if there was a play to be performed, he would always take on an important role. After leaving school, he went through a lot of trials in society, joining a theater troupe and performing stage plays. Therefore, he was quite skilled when he appeared on the silver screen, and soon showed amazing acting skills, becoming a rising star.

Academy Award

Indeed, Clark Gable has become a generation of artist in Hollywood. Among male stars, his acting skills can be said to be among the best! Every film he stars in achieves considerable success. The general movie audience also has a considerable fondness for him. He won the Academy Award for Film Arts in 1934, and that year, he was ranked first among the three winning male stars. Since then, his status in the film industry has been rising day by day.

Instant Fame

It is indeed not easy for him to achieve today's status in the Hollywood film industry and be recognized as an outstanding talent by the general public. Because not many years ago, when he arrived in Hollywood, he did not even have the opportunity to be an extra for a while. But he did not lose heart, and continued to work hard, determined to break through this film front. As a result, where there is a will, there is a way. He broke through, and unexpectedly, he rose to fame as soon as he appeared on the screen, becoming so popular so quickly, which is unmatched by ordinary male stars.

Affectionate Couple

Since he has such success on the screen, according to convention, many actresses in Hollywood pursue him. As a result, Carole Lombard was the winner. In the winter before last, the two were very much in love, and romances were often reported. Lovers become family, and in the spring of 1939, the film city spread the news of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard's marriage to every corner of the world, making fans feel that this film couple was perfect. From then on, they formed a happy family, and many guests often visited their home. Last Christmas, Carole Lombard even personally cooked to entertain guests.

Reaching New Heights

This time, Clark Gable was cast as the male lead in "Gone with the Wind." Due to his past experience and innate artistic talent, playing such a role was naturally a good fit. In addition, the female lead was played by newcomer Vivien Leigh, which would naturally complement each other. Therefore, when "Gone with the Wind" was completed and then publicly released in the United States, Clark Gable received good reviews from fans again. Facts tell us that Gable is a very good actor.

### Shu Nie Leaves Shanghai

The day before yesterday afternoon, a cultural worker quietly left Shanghai for the mainland. He is Mao Shuyin, who used to write film reviews for the Chen Bao, and Shi Wen, who once made a guest appearance in "Ge Nen Niang" and other plays with the China Travel Troupe.

After the outbreak of the war, he was sent north to comfort the National Army, and visited Wuhan, Henan, Shanxi, northern Shaanxi and other places. Later, he served as the secretary of the General Headquarters of the Fourth War Zone and was in charge of political training work.

This time he quietly left Shanghai, also to do some wartime cultural work, fulfilling the mission that a cultural person should have. Before leaving Shanghai, he completed two plays, namely, he adapted "Dong Xiaowan" and "Jingzhong Warring States" into two spoken drama scripts. Now these scripts have been handed over to Tang Huaiqiu of the "China Travel Troupe" for performance at the Xuan Palace in the near future.

### The Jindu Grand Theater Will Start Construction at the End of the Month

— Little Xu

—Grand Opening on New Year's Day

The "Jindu Grand Theater" (English name: Golden Castle Theatre), jointly funded by film tycoons the Liu brothers, Zhang Shanxian, Zhang Shichuan, etc., has decided to start construction at the end of this month. This future new-style cinema is located at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Doumer, a superior and convenient location. The vacant lot is now surrounded by bamboo fences, and the atmosphere of construction is already visible. It is estimated that it will be completed within half a year and will open on New Year's Day. The architectural design of the theater was entrusted to Yang Xiliu and Huang Yuanji of the Kaitai Architectural Firm. The style is streamlined. In terms of equipment, the cold and hot air machines are the latest models, and the sound, lighting, and seats are all first-class products. There are more than 1,500 seats in total, 500 upstairs and 1,000 downstairs. The main entrance is located in the middle of the street corner. The films to be shown in the future will mostly be the first-run productions of Guohua and Xinhua.

### A Report on the Experimental Concert

— Zhang Yongkang

On the evening of the 14th, the YMCA held an "experimental concert". The program included ensemble, solo, chorus and solo singing.

Most of the ensembles were performed by the "Mei Ye Quintet", with the "Heaven and Hell Overture" being the best, and the "Lullaby" also being very beautiful.

The solo instrument was the violin, played by Mei Ye, a Russian of Chinese descent, with Chen Gexin accompanying on the piano, playing "Gypsy Airs". This is a very difficult piece of music. Except for some unclear passages in the slow tempo, it was played very well. The final rapid section was played quite briskly and powerfully.

The chorus was conducted by Chen Gexin, with a total of six songs. "Forward" was originally the tune of the Volga Boatmen's Song, but now the words have been changed, but it does not lose the original sense of grief. The lightness of "Boating Music" is a contrast to "Forward". "Golden Floating Clouds", "Fatherland March" and "Song of Transbaikalia" are works of old or new Russia. The conductor has special touches in handling these Russian tunes, as if he were Russian: that is to say, he understands the rich expression that is unique to Russian music. "Chain Iron" was sung very well, but no one could hear the words.

Xu He and Hu Quanxiang have very good sound quality, but they are a bit "stage-frightened", and seem afraid to sing. Zheng Shouyan did not sing, and the audience was quite disappointed.

It is said that most of the members of "Shi Yin" are professional youths, who have not specialized in music. If this is true, it should be considered very successful.

### Another Double Case — Guohua and Lianmei Simultaneously Filming Liang Hongyu

The Lianmei Company, which caused a heated competition among private film companies because of "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai", had already purchased the two scripts of "Liang Hongyu" and "Gorgeous Fate" for its second work, which has been planned for many days, and will choose one to film. However, at the film association meeting, Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua, indicated that "Liang Hongyu" was about to start filming, and "Hua Li Yuan" was also already finalized, and neither could be conceded. The Lianmei representative was willing to avoid conflict and asked Guohua to each get one script, and also asked Guohua to join the investment in the works filmed by Lianmei. Mr. Liu did not agree, and they broke up unhappily, which is likely to cause another double case after "The Three Smiles".
