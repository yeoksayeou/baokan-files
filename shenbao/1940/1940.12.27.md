After the Chinese Buddhist delegation returned to China, the recent situation of Buddhism in the accompanying capital should be told to you. In May and June, when our Buddhist delegation returned to the accompanying capital, it was during the height of Japanese aircraft bombing. The Chang'an Temple, where the Chinese Buddhist Association is located, is a magnificent and solemn Buddhist temple that has stood for hundreds of years. Now, it and the nearby Luohan Temple have both been reduced to rubble. What will your feelings be when you visit the site of the Chinese Buddhist Association's headquarters, Chang'an Temple, which was bombed four times and completely destroyed? However, while Japanese aircraft were bombing the accompanying capital, our Buddhist disciples, with the spirit of sacrificing themselves to save the world, formed a rescue team and stood tall on Lion Mountain on the south bank. They rescued the wounded and helped the dying under the bombing of Japanese aircraft from the north and south, earning the reputation of being the bravest in the accompanying capital."

### Food Supply in Southern Guangxi Not Expected to Be Lacking

Nanning: A reporter recently interviewed someone from the Guangxi Food Administration Department to inquire about the food supply and demand situation after the recovery of lost territory in southern Guangxi. According to him, this province experienced a drought this autumn, but the areas along the river suffered very little damage, and the harvest was quite good. Therefore, the food supply and demand in the recovered areas will not be a problem in the short term. At the beginning of the recapture of Nanning, food prices were very low. Now, as the people gradually return, the price of rice has also risen to about 21 yuan. However, in Mingjiang and Pingxiang, it is only sold for 17 or 18 yuan. However, in order to prevent a rice shortage during the lean spring season, the Food Administration Department and the provincial government have both formulated plans and ordered all counties in southern Guangxi to actively store grain in preparation for emergencies.

### Thai Prime Minister Says British-Thai Relations Are Excellent; Believes Britain Sympathizes with Its Territorial Demands; Thai and Vietnamese Troops Exchange Artillery Fire

Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, in a one-hour talk with a Reuters correspondent last night, expressed gratitude for British friendship and attention to Japan's so-called New Order. He also indicated Thailand's willingness to negotiate with France regarding the Vietnamese border dispute, stating that British-Thai relations are indeed excellent, as evidenced by the rapid and peaceful resolution of the recent Thai-Burmese border issue. He believes that Britain will sympathize with Thailand's demands on Vietnam and that Thailand is prepared to shake hands with France tomorrow and forget the animosity of the past 75 years, as long as the sparsely populated areas on the Thai side of the Mekong River are returned to Thailand so that Thailand can have a natural border. He also said that when the war was about to break out, France had intended to conclude a military agreement with Thailand, but Thailand declined because it wanted to maintain its neutrality. As for Japan's so-called New Order, Thailand will carefully study it because it has trade and other relations with Japan, but Thailand's greatest concern is to maintain its independent existence.

Bangkok: According to the Thai Gazette, Thai and Vietnamese troops clashed again yesterday, exchanging artillery fire. Vietnamese troops concentrated, but were dispersed by Thai artillery. Thai troops also sank two small boats dispatched by Vietnamese troops. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)

Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram told foreign reporters on Tuesday that he believes Britain sympathizes with Thailand's territorial demands. He also believes that the new Thai-Japanese agreement is based on friendly mutual assistance and respect for territorial sovereignty, and is therefore no different from a non-aggression pact. He also said that Thailand is now studying Japan's proposed "New Order" in the Far East, and that Thailand has decided to take retaliatory measures against the French army's offensive. The Prime Minister also said that the French were the instigators of the Thai-Vietnamese war, as the French launched the attack first, disregarding the Thai people's gesture of peace. Songkhram also said that he himself is a peace-loving person and is always prepared to resolve the dispute with Vietnam, but Thailand's future actions will depend on the behavior of the French. He said that British-Thai relations have become smoother due to the adjustment of the Burmese border. Prime Minister Songkhram met with reporters at the Rose Palace. Songkhram's physique is quite healthy, and the Prime Minister knows a little English. The Prime Minister said, "Since we launched peace on the French side on December 14, the French side has not received any response other than intensifying the air raids. This is what we deeply regret." When asked if British support for Thailand's territorial demands was true, he replied, "We believe we have gained the sympathy of the British."

French-Thai Relations Difficult to Improve

Bangkok: In a recent conversation with foreign reporters, Thai Prime Minister Songkhram, when asked by reporters if the arrival of a Saiburi delegation in Bangkok would mean that the door to a peaceful solution had been closed, replied, "I dare say that the relationship between our country and France is very far from peace, because first, France does not agree to the construction of border adjustments; second, the bombing and artillery fire on the border are initiated by France; third, France ignores even the proposals made by the former French ambassador to Thailand in preparation for a peaceful solution. In the past few decades, the French have ruled Vietnam with cruel means, and since the French defeat, their cruel methods have become even more intense. Our compatriots in Vietnam can no longer tolerate it, and thus revolutions have sprung up everywhere. At present, 10,000 Vietnamese people have crossed the border, including 200 Annamese soldiers, carrying heavy artillery and machine guns, to join our side, hoping to maintain their freedom and security. If the French continue to abuse our people in Vietnam, even if the Mekong River border is adjusted, our heart of resistance to France will not cease. The anti-French revolution in Vietnam has already formed a permanent phenomenon, which is nothing but the result of French oppression." (United Press dispatch of the 26th)

Bangkok: Local officials recently stated that French and Thai troops have continued to exchange artillery fire on the border, disregarding the spirit that should be maintained during the Christmas holiday. The French army, which attacked Thais, fired eight shells at Lakon Fanlong on Christmas Eve, and Thai artillery retaliated with eleven shells. Near Aranyaprathet and Ubon Ratchathani (both translated phonetically), the result of the machine gun fire between the two sides caused one woman to lose her life and two men to be injured in Ubon Ratchathani. Clashes also occurred near Klong Malik and Lakon Fanlong (both translated phonetically) on Monday and Tuesday. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)

Editorial

### Rumors Concerning the Chinese Communist Party

In the free and open land of China, how does the Chinese Communist Party, in its spirit of unity, under the rule of the government, interact with other parties? How does it contribute to the war effort? There is relatively little news of this kind in Shanghai. On the contrary, there are more unfounded rumors. Especially since Shanghai newspapers have previously published fragmentary accounts, stating that the Chinese military authorities ordered the New Fourth Army to be transferred to the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, northern Shandong, and northern Shanxi. Then, all sorts of claims seemed to ferment like yeast: 1. Because the newspapers had not published such accounts for a long time, those who heard them felt they were novel, and those who spoke of them took them as material for conversation. 2. Because most of the officers of the New Fourth Army were members of the Communist Party, people instinctively felt a political consciousness and were affected by the innate human interest in politics. 3. Because in the guerrilla war zones near Shanghai, many active and disciplined guerrilla units kept their designations secret as a matter of military principle, but the New Fourth Army gradually became an open secret. Therefore, in this area, the general public assumed that all formal guerrilla units, regardless of their actual designation, were the New Fourth Army. In contrast to the gangs of bandits who harassed the villages, the general public cherished and protected the formal guerrilla units, and was therefore unusually concerned about any news and rumors involving the New Fourth Army. 4. The fourth reason always goes to extremes, especially since the first three reasons provided opportunities to exploit. This is also what is called "expanding official announcements." In the past two or three days, there have been widespread rumors about how the Nationalists and Communists are clashing in the central government and how they are conflicting in the local areas. The propaganda has been effective, causing those who hear it to worry and doubt.

The worst things to do when dealing with rumors are to be biased and to follow blindly. With bias, one either dismisses them as inaccurate or is happy to believe them easily. The result may be completely contrary to the facts. If one follows blindly, one unintentionally becomes the target of those who spread rumors. If one passes them on from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred, passing on errors from mouth to mouth, then one unintentionally becomes a tool of those who spread rumors. Even if one blindly follows but only keeps it to oneself, since the facts are fabricated, wouldn't the joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness in one's heart be too unjust? To reject bias, vigorously guard against blind following, and yet be unable to give up the rumors one has heard, the best thing to do is to diligently seek evidence. Based on the information obtained through diligent inquiry, one can either clearly prove that the rumors are solid or disprove that the rumors are unfounded. If the information is insufficient, then use common sense to judge. Reporters and readers are both in Shanghai, and there is no way to obtain enough information to make a clear proof or disproof of the various things concerning the CCP in the free and open land. Even the rumored transfer of the New Fourth Army is quite credible, but it is still appropriate to solemnly place it among the rumors. In dealing with such rumors, it is not difficult to use constant feelings and principles to decide whether to believe them or not.

First, political power must be based on the people. The people's obedience, following, and support of a political system do not depend on the length of all the theories in this system, the greatness of the authority, or the number of party members, but on the credibility that this system demonstrates and the trust that the people have in it. The thickness and multitude of trust are in a certain direct proportion to the size and strength of the power. This is a constant feeling and principle, and it is also an absolutely identical political iron law throughout ancient and modern times, in China and abroad. Facts must receive the final and most fair judgment from this iron law. The Chinese Communist Party solemnly declares that it accepts the Three Principles of the People as the founding principles and is loyal to the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country. This has already become the broadest and most shallow creed of all actions and attitudes of the Chinese Communist Party. With the CCP's aspirations, it is certainly not necessary to wait for the urging or pressure from outside the party, but it will automatically abide by the creed and will not want to lose faith with the public, hoping to gain more people's following and support. Therefore, no matter from what point or angle one observes the Chinese Communist Party, all rumors concerning the CCP's abandonment of the Three Principles of the People and hindering the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country can be asserted to be inaccurate. Friction between people is mainly because the party and the party have not been able to maintain complete harmony at all times and in all things. This is within the realm of constant feelings and principles. However, as far as the Nationalists and Communists are concerned, there is also a maximum limit. That is, any friction and disharmony will not exceed the boundaries of accepting the Three Principles of the People and completing the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country. This is not a bias in favor of doctrines and policies, but the standard by which the people show their love, hate, closeness, and distance to the Communist Party, and it is also a judgment that can be used to predict the political future of the Communist Party in China. To take a step back, at least this is inevitable during the period of resistance against Japan and building the country.

Second, "regarding the New Fourth Army issue." Troop transfers are common in military affairs. Military orders, of course, do not come with reasons. In a country in peacetime, especially in wartime, military orders must be unified and must be implemented. Therefore, assuming that the rumors of the transfer are true, the question is definitely not whether there is a reason or not. Nor is it whether the New Fourth Army is willing or unwilling to obey the transfer order. Not only is the question not here, but the transfer should be regarded as normal and it should be asserted that it should not become a question at all. If it is said that this involves politics and is therefore not simple, then in fact, it is a great misconception to regard this as involving politics. This is because the army is led by officers, but does not belong to the officers who lead it. Officers have their beliefs and their party affiliation, but the army does not belong to the party because of the officer's party affiliation. In short, it is the army of the country. In peacetime, especially in wartime, the army must not be divided into so-called spheres of influence, and there must be no so-called obedience or disobedience. Only then can it fight, and only then can it win. If it is divided into spheres of influence, it becomes a distinction between friend and enemy. If there is obedience or disobedience, there is a distinction between compliance and defiance. Therefore, the New Fourth Army, which is ordered to transfer, may be reluctant to leave its original defense area because of the time and feelings that have accumulated, but it will definitely not act in defiance and disobey orders. Those who claim to resist orders and refuse to leave must be a group with ulterior motives. They are not the army of the country, not a formal guerrilla unit, and not the true New Fourth Army. If there are any problems, it is not easy to conduct large-scale marches publicly, leaving only the technical problems of the transfer and the time issue. Taking a step back, if military orders and military actions do contain some political implications, then not only should one not believe the rumors of resistance to the transfer based on common sense; on the contrary, imagine that the New Fourth Army is absolutely willing to transfer to Hebei, Chahar, northern Shandong, and northern Shanxi for political reasons, so that it can gradually concentrate and strengthen forces with the Eighteenth Group Army in that area. Judging from constant feelings and principles, no army is willing to be scattered and thin, that is, there is no reason to believe the rumors.

Third, regarding the rumored conflicts in certain places, not only are the names of the generals, the designations of the troops, and the locations mentioned in the rumors "mismatched," and one knows immediately that they are impossible and unbelievable; but also in terms of the greater principle and the overall situation, within a narrow area, in fact and in terms of interests, only two armies are allowed to stand against each other, and a three-way stand is not allowed. Even if there is a momentary stand, it must immediately become a friendly or hostile party due to the relationship of interests, grievances, and closeness. From this point of view, would an army led by a truly Communist general collude with the Japanese army? Would an army led by a Kuomintang general collude with the Japanese army? It is absolutely impossible to abandon friends to help enemies and turn against each other. If there is such a thing, it is a mobile element between the positions of the Chinese and Japanese armies, and what does it have to do with the Chinese Communist Party?

The above three kinds of unbelievable rumors have the four reasons mentioned earlier that help spread the rumors. In addition, there is one more point that may increase the attention of various parties inside and outside the country to the rumors: that is, the Soviet Union gives sympathy and assistance to China's war of resistance. Then, assuming that there is a problem of mutual hostility between the Nationalists and Communists, wouldn't this affect Sino-Soviet relations, and even affect the future of the war of resistance? This is a question that China and China's friends should be concerned about. And those who are most excited are those who expect Sino-Soviet relations to deteriorate. They believe that by undermining Sino-Soviet relations, they can seize the favor of the Soviet Union. The gains and losses in this should be discussed separately. In China, the sole goal is to strive for independence and freedom and maintain the integrity of sovereignty and territory. All internal measures, whether military, political, or economic, and all external choices, whether friendly, friendly, estranged, or hostile, are based on this goal as the sole standard. That is, even the issues related to the above-mentioned rumors must be considered and decided based on this standard. In the Soviet Union, it must also decide everything based on the current and near-future interests of its entire country. That is, its compromise with Germany and its assistance to China are two completely different aspects, but it can be believed that the basic reasons are completely consistent. As for Sino-Soviet relations and the coexistence of the Nationalists and Communists in China, these are two circles with different centers. Although the two centers are quite close, they will never merge into one. Therefore, both China and the Soviet Union will inevitably take the coexistence of the Nationalists and Communists in China as an object for serious consideration, but it is not a factor that determines everything. Therefore, even if the Nationalists and Communists are hostile to each other, one cannot draw the conclusion that Sino-Soviet relations will deteriorate and be detrimental to the war of resistance, let alone draw the conclusion that there will be friendship between the Soviets and Japan. Moreover, the rumors are inaccurate!

### Shaoguan to Shark Bay Highway Suffers Repeated Bombings

Hong Kong – Travelers injured on the highway from Shaoguan to Shark Bay due to repeated air raids have arrived here and recounted their experiences. It is said that the section from Xixiang Village (transliteration) to Huizhou was bombed by Japanese aircraft for a week, making this section of the journey the most difficult. Xixiang Village is not far from Hong Kong and is the first stop from Shark Bay. The small village was bombed for five consecutive days and is almost completely in ruins. The third stop, Guichuan (transliteration), was also heavily bombed, and the same happened to Danshui and Huizhou. Freight stations, oil depots, and garages were all targets of Japanese aircraft. According to travelers, most pedestrians were killed or injured by aircraft strafing. Japanese aircraft flew low, only about thirty feet above the ground. More than thirty corpses have been sent back here for burial. If it were not for the difficulty of medical treatment on the road, some of them could still have been saved. The goods on the highway were all destroyed by incendiary bombs. Because the bombs were dropped from low altitude, they were very easy to hit the target. There is now a large amount of goods piled up on the highway, and the goods piled up in Shark Bay are in a mess. Because the customs must wait until after 5 p.m. to remove the goods, the customs do not perform their duties during the day for fear of air raids. Japanese aircraft focused on bombing the coolies and pedestrians between Shark Bay and Danshui, and also paid attention to all sailboats and gasoline boats directly connected to the Dongjiang River source. From here, travelers must abandon their boats and go ashore, taking the highway to Shaoguan. It is generally believed that these air raids will continue to occur. In the past ten days, fifty people have been killed and seventy injured in air raids, with goods losses reaching one million yuan in national currency. (23rd International News Agency dispatch)

### Du Yuesheng's Broadcast Speech to Shanghai Residents

Chongqing – Last night, Du Yuesheng issued a special broadcast here to Shanghai residents, warning Chinese in the occupied areas not to use banknotes issued by the "Nanjing Central Bank" to avoid trouble for themselves. He said that the banknotes issued by the banks under the control of the Japanese military have now reached 200 billion yuan and have no sufficient guarantee. The Japanese hope to use these banknotes to obtain legal tender in order to purchase foreign exchange or buy Chinese goods. When the Japanese army is driven out in the future, these banknotes will become waste paper and have no value. The total amount of banknotes issued by the Chongqing Central Government, as of now, has only reached 390 billion yuan. In addition to ordinary guarantees, the United States has recently lent China 100 million US dollars, and the United Kingdom has lent 100 million pounds sterling to stabilize the legal tender. The Soviet Union has also lent a large sum of money. The Central Government does not recognize unapproved currency. He hopes that Shanghai residents will pay attention and not use it.

### Greek Army Continues to Attack, Occupying the Entire Coastal Area and Advancing Towards Vlorë

Athens – Today's official gazette stated that the Greek army is advancing towards Vlorë and continues to make progress. The Italian army is currently retreating southwest from Himarë, while the Greek army continues to advance northwest of Himarë and has occupied a new stronghold. The Greek army fighting northeast of Premeti has also occupied a strategically important stronghold in the interior. Another official gazette stated that the Greek army captured many enemies and seized eight artillery pieces and a large amount of military supplies in a limited war. (26th Reuters dispatch)

Athens – According to reports received here, Greek soldiers are celebrating Christmas by continuing their offensive in Albania, occupying three villages fifteen miles outside of Vlorë, and capturing many prisoners and spoils of war. This area is an important Italian base on the Adriatic Sea. Greek troops have occupied the entire coastal area and the road from Arshisaranda to Himarë. Informed sources believe that the Greek army cleared out the Italian troops who had fled into Palermo a few days ago. This area was once occupied by the Greeks and later retaken by the Italians. Reports from Himarë state that the road from Palermo north to Himarë is being heavily shelled by the Greeks from the sea, and some locations are impassable. The last nine miles to Himarë can only be traversed on horseback. (26th United Press dispatch)

Khimarë Celebrates Joyously After the Disaster; Military and Civilians Celebrate Christmas Together

Khimarë – The Italian army has withdrawn. Today is the happiest Christmas Eve in Khimarë since 1921. Local soldiers and people are thanking God in the domed church tonight for the rescue of Khimarë. Amid the melodious singing, one can hear the booming of cannons from the mountains outside. The Greek soldiers on the front line are still pursuing the Italian army towards Vlorë. The Italian army looted heavily before withdrawing. Although there were candles shining in front of the statues of gods in the churches, the doors and windows were filled with sandbags. Reporters and others followed the Greek army machine gun team and were the first to enter the city. Young girls and old women in the city hugged us. An old man named George said that he had hidden a turkey that was not looted by the Italian soldiers and would treat us to a Christmas feast. Furthermore, the Italian soldiers forgot to leave behind some fine Italian wine in the Italian soldiers' canteen, which we can enjoy to the fullest. (24th United Press dispatch)

Athens – The newspapers here published an article by the president of the Athens News Agency, Vikelas, stating that Greece was forced to fight due to the Italian invasion, so this is not a war to conquer others, but a war to liberate itself. The Greeks can celebrate Christmas with their heads held high. Mussolini is an aggressor who does not know what compassion is and hypocritically claims to be a Christian. In reality, he is stabbing Christ with a blade stabbing Greece, because anyone who violates Christ's laws of peace is tantamount to stabbing Christ. (26th Reuters dispatch)

### British and Italian Forces Exchange Artillery Fire Around Bardia; Italians Bomb British Forces to Reduce Pressure; British Also Bomb Italian Airfields and Ports

Cairo – Headquarters intelligence yesterday stated that preparations for the British attack on Bardia are gradually intensifying and are not being halted by enemy aerial activity. The Italian forces are attempting to reduce the pressure on Bardia by quickly dispatching aircraft to attack the concentrated British forces. However, military circles believe that the British will not delay their plans because of this and said that Bardia will be attacked at the scheduled time. It is understood that the result of these air raids is only minor losses. Royal Air Force intelligence stated that British bombers attacked the Italian airfields of Mithi and Akheila in the western desert. (26th United Press dispatch)

Cairo – The notable military activities around Bardia on Christmas Day were limited to continuous artillery fire between the two armies and Italian aircraft bombing the concentrated British forces. The British forces gathered opposite the Italian strongholds were attacked by Italian dive bombers, but frontline observers said that the Italian aircraft attacks were mostly ineffective and that British casualties were light. British military chaplains held simple Christmas prayer services for the troops throughout the western desert. A recent Royal Air Force communiqué stated that British bombers attacked the Gazala airfield in the western desert on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning, and the bombs all landed within the target area, but the extent of the damage could not be ascertained. On Tuesday, British fighter planes were still actively patrolling throughout the day but did not encounter Italian aircraft. British aircraft also attacked the Italian base of Vlorë in Albania, diving down, penetrating the low-lying clouds, and attacking Vlorë harbor and the city.

### Soviet Union Feels Threatened by Germany and Japan; Actively Expands Red Army Fleet; Main Force Stays in the Pacific to Guard Against Possible Invasion; Powerful Submarine Force Built, Largest in the World

Washington – According to unofficial information obtained by the US Navy Department, the Soviet Union has built the most powerful submarine force in the world, totaling no less than 171 ships. According to this figure, the Soviet submarine force is 50 ships larger than Germany's, which has 120 submarines and is the second largest submarine force in the world. The exact number of submarines the Soviet Union is currently building is unknown, but according to recent reports, the number is very large. The Soviet Union has repeatedly published official gazettes expressing its intention to greatly expand the Red Army fleet. However, in other respects, the Soviet Navy is only second-rate in the world. However, it has no fewer than six strategic coastal locations, and its neighbors are powerful and aggressive naval powers. According to credible information in the reports received, the Soviet Union currently has three old battleships, all built in 1911, which are of little use in combat. These battleships are slow, lightly armed, and have limited range. In addition, the Soviet Union has nine cruisers, one aircraft carrier, and sixty-seven destroyers, with several more ships under construction. In terms of tonnage, the Red Army's maritime strength is not less than that of other countries. Due to its vast territory, the Soviet Union's naval strength is inevitably dispersed. The main force of the Red Army fleet must remain in the Pacific to defend against the Japanese Navy to the extent possible. Japan's Navy is the third largest in the world and claims to have ten battleships, with another eight under construction. Japan has five times more destroyers than the Soviet Union. Japan also has seven aircraft carriers, while the Soviet Union only has one. In addition to keeping a large part of its fleet in the Pacific, the Soviet Union must also keep a small number in the Black Sea. After Germany gained a base in the area, it is expected that the Soviet Union will increase its strength in that area. Since Romania fell into the Axis group, Greece has continuously sent small submarines to Romania. The new German base in the Black Sea has invisibly posed a minor threat to the Soviet Union. In addition, the Red Army fleet must also keep a small number in the Baltic Sea. Since annexing Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, the Soviet Union has gained a long-range naval frontier in the area. The Soviet Union in the Baltic Sea, like in the Black Sea, is ideally opposed by a small but modern navy. Although Germany has suffered many losses due to the European war, Germany's Navy is superior to the Soviet Union's in both quantity and quality. Germany has six battleships, all relatively new, and two more are under construction. For this reason, the Soviet Union's need for a large navy is no less than that of Britain and Japan. The overseas supply and maintenance of raw materials in Britain and Japan depend on the power of the Navy. However, Moscow has realized this, and officials have repeatedly declared that the country's fleet should be greatly expanded. (6th United Press dispatch)

### Christmas Sky Truce; Hitler Makes a Surprise Tour; Berlin Officials Emphasize Implication; Will Launch a More Intense Attack on England Again

Berlin – According to today's disclosure, German leader Hitler took advantage of the three-day Christmas truce in Western European airspace to take a Christmas tour to "somewhere in the west" aboard a German naval patrol boat. This "somewhere in the west" is likely the English Channel. This is the first time that the German leader has toured the western sea surrounding the territory of an enemy country. This morning, no aircraft carrying bombs were seen flying over the Channel. The German proposal for a Christmas truce has been confirmed by officials here today. (26th International News Agency dispatch)

Berlin – Officials here yesterday hinted in strong tones that after the current "Christmas truce," Germany will immediately inflict a more powerful blow on England than before. It is said that Germany proposed a three-day Christmas truce, and the cessation of aerial warfare during these three days is obviously being watched by all parties. Regarding the proposal to England for a sky truce, Germany notified Washington that if the British Air Force does not attack Germany and its occupied areas, German aircraft will not bomb England. So far, neither side has broken this tacit truce agreement. However, German officials said that if the British side attacks Germany, Germany will immediately retaliate. (26th International News Agency dispatch)

Berlin – A German command headquarters communiqué stated that the German Air Force had not attacked the enemy from December 24, including that night and the 25th. During the same period, enemy aircraft did not attack German territory, so in practice, there was an informal Christmas truce between the two countries. (2)

London – Although there was no definitive agreement on a suspension of aerial warfare during Christmas, the Royal Air Force did not fly to Germany that day, and the activity of German aircraft over Britain was limited to a few German aircraft appearing in the skies over the Orkney Islands and off the coast of Scotland. Whether this quiet on the second Christmas of the war was due to the weather is not yet known. British bombers were dispatched on Christmas Eve, and London did not issue an alert. However, one German aircraft was shot down by a British fighter plane in the Orkney Islands, and the four crew members were captured. (26th Reuters dispatch)

London – Yesterday was Christmas, and Christ bestowed peace upon the British and German peoples. The British and German nations respected Christ and ceased fire with each other. At the suggestion of the German side, both sides tacitly agreed to a temporary truce on Christmas Day. As dusk approached, no trace of German aircraft was seen in the skies over the British Isles. No German aircraft were seen on Tuesday evening and all day on Sunday. German artillery on the continental coast of the English Channel remained silent, and the British artillery batteries in the Dover area along the coast also remained silent. Germany, through neutral diplomatic channels, had hinted that if the British did not send aircraft to bomb on Christmas, Germany would also avoid aerial warfare. Although British officials refused to admit that the British government had signed any truce agreement with the Germans, British bombers did not fly to Germany and German-occupied areas of the Continent to carry out their usual air raids.

### French Law Does Not Allow Martinique to Be Used by the American Navy; Ambassador Leahy to Consult with Pétain; Vichy Deeply Fears Provoking German Displeasure

Washington, Yesterday's reliable sources say, American naval leaders believe that Martinique Island is sufficient to become an important unit of liaison bases, for the currently planned construction to defend the southern entrance and exit of the Caribbean Sea. American naval leaders are very willing to use the island as a naval and air base. Recently, the French government has refused to approve the use of the island. Experts say that the use of the island will cause the entire Caribbean Sea to be closed. Informal talks on mainland leases or other rights have been held one after another. German and French officials politely refused. Therefore, it is widely believed that when former Naval Operations Director Admiral Leahy arrives in Vichy to take office as the American ambassador, he will discuss this matter with Marshal Pétain. Officials said that the French attitude towards this matter is influenced by the fear of German retaliation, because Germany may regard the granting of base rights as an anti-Nazi move.

Special Article

### American Ambassador to Japan, Grew

Ambassador Grew, in terms of belief and experience, is a businessman. He despises titles bought with money, just as writers despise books bought with money. When some people who claim to be diplomats talk to him, Grew always evades the topic and tells them, "I know what nitrate is." He walks hesitantly and speaks stutteringly. Finally, when he is forced to, he says, "Yes, I know they are lower than the current valuation."

When Grew was young, he suffered from scarlet fever, which caused him to lose his hearing in his left ear. When she first entered the diplomatic world, Harvard University Professor Coolidge gave her the nickname of "deaf diplomat." Grew was disappointed and almost committed suicide. But he came back to know how to make good use of his shortcomings. He has never worn a hearing aid. He knows that not hearing shallow and ignorant remarks is also good for him, or it is better to pretend not to hear them. For example, if angry words have to be repeatedly explained to the deaf, wouldn't it be too ridiculous. He also felt the humorous side of this matter. From 1922 to 1923, he represented the United States in the Lausanne Conference convened for the Near East issue. Turkish Foreign Minister Ismet was also deaf. Grew often sat in a corner with him, talking loudly in French, exchanging their opinions.

No one really knows how deaf Ambassador Grew is. A few years ago, when Quezon, the elected President of the Philippines, traveled to Japan, the Japanese Imperial Family held an informal banquet to entertain Quezon. During the banquet, the seats were arranged with Quezon sitting on the right of the Japanese Emperor and Grew sitting on the left of the Japanese Emperor. Before everyone was seated, Grew's attendant pointed out the error in this seating arrangement. The food officer immediately explained to him that this seating arrangement would make it easier for the Emperor's words to enter Grew's ear that was not deaf. Grew, upon hearing this, said, "Don't talk nonsense! I can hear everything the Emperor says to me, no matter what language."

Mrs. Grew doesn't like this tiger skin glaring at her for a reason. She was born into a prestigious Boston family, gentle in nature and elegant in manners. She does not like the expression of rude emotions, whether it is a person or a tiger. Like her, being calm, tolerant, gentle, and amiable can be considered a perfect diplomatic wife. The story of Grew and her marriage is also a beautiful story in his life.

Not long after he returned to Boston via Spain, at a banquet, he asked someone to introduce him to Miss Lin Deland, who had just returned from Japan. Unexpectedly, due to some strange circumstances, he was mistakenly introduced to Miss Alice Perry. This Miss Alice had not only lived in Japan but was also the great-niece of the intrepid old Perry, who was the first to open up Japan. Grew fell in love at first sight and began to pursue her.

He felt that his work in Cairo was not only limited in income (military pay was only 600 yuan) but also very boring, so he was determined to pursue Alice. Finally, he proposed to her in a telegram and was accepted. He hurried back to Boston. A few hours before the wedding on October 7, 1905, Alice's father, with a stern face, led Grew to the dining room, pushed open a window, and said to him, "This is your last chance to escape. I will never tell anyone." Grew was bold enough to remain calm even four days away from a fierce tiger, so of course, small matters were not worth mentioning.

Grew's career in the diplomatic world has been smooth sailing. He was promoted from Cairo to Third Secretary of the Mexican Legation, then transferred to the Russian Embassy as Third Secretary, the German Embassy as Second Secretary, and the Austrian Legation as Secretary. When the clouds of war loomed in 1914, he was transferred back to Berlin. When the last European War broke out, he served as the Counselor of Ambassador Gerard. During the three most tense months of Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, he served as Chargé d'Affaires. He was one of the last Americans to leave Berlin and Vienna.

When the last European War was about to end, he served as the Director of the Western European Division of the State Department in Washington. Soon after, he was dispatched to Europe with President Wilson's special envoy, Colonel House, to participate in the armistice negotiations. This departure was extremely secretive. His beloved wife and children were vacationing in Hancock and had no idea of his plan. It was not until he arrived on the other side of the Atlantic that they learned about it. After the armistice treaty was signed, he jumped to the rank of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, serving as the Secretary of the American Delegation to the Peace Conference.

Grew's travelogues make people feel like reading a travel guide. His wife has established homes in 20 cities. His children and grandchildren were born in the capital of Switzerland, New York, Tokyo, and Ottawa, Canada, in chronological order. He has ridden in various means of transportation, from rickshaws to airplanes. He has sailed on the world's most luxurious giant ship and on a small steamer whose passenger list only included Mr. Grew and 93 Chinese people. (To be continued)

### Japan Excludes the Rights and Interests of Various Countries; Seeks to Monopolize Trade in China; North China and the Yangtze River Are Almost Entirely Controlled; Intensified Efforts Are Also Being Made in Shanghai

Regarding Japan's exclusion of the interests of third countries in China, it has recently become even more intensified. In Central China, Japan has organized a number of monopolistic companies to monopolize import and export trade. In North China, it uses the "United Reserve Bank" to implement control over exchange and trade.

Trade Statistics Use Smoke Screens

According to sources in the Shanghai business community, foreign trade in North China has been monopolized by Japan. Because the Japanese use smoke screens in trade statistics, the detailed situation is not yet known to all sectors. According to reporters' inquiries with relevant parties, for goods from countries outside the Japanese yen bloc entering North China, when compiling statistics, the customs under Japanese management convert the prices of various imported goods (landed prices, calculated in foreign currency) into national currency according to the black market exchange rate, and then convert them into gold units according to the ratio of national currency to gold units, which is different from the recording method adopted by the Shanghai Customs.

British and American Commerce Actually Declines

Therefore, if the import of American goods in Shanghai is 10,000 gold units, according to the calculation method of Tianjin, it is listed as 50,000 gold units. Therefore, on the surface, if statistics are used as a basis, British and American imported goods in North China have not decreased, but in reality, they have decreased significantly. However, this kind of obfuscation method by the Japanese can only cover up the ears and eyes of the general Chinese and foreign people, while the British and American businessmen and diplomats in China have already understood its content.

Yangtze River Basin Dominated by Japanese Merchants

Recently, the "North China United Reserve Bank" has become increasingly strict in controlling import and export trade and exchange. Imports must be licensed, and exports must be settled. British and American commercial firms have suffered severe blows. In Central China, the opening of the Yangtze River shipping has been repeatedly delayed, and the import and export trade in the Yangtze River basin is monopolized by Japanese merchants, and third countries have no room to intervene.

Shanghai Is Again Intensifying Control

Only the Shanghai area can foreign merchants still be free, but recently the Japanese father and son have intensified control. The "Jiangning Bank" will also open on schedule, so in the future, the Japanese will inevitably promote the method of excluding foreign merchants in North China to various parts of Central China, and the center of British and American economic interests in China is also in jeopardy.

### Italian Ship "Carini" with Cotton Detained

The English-language Great American Evening News said that the Italian merchant river ship "Carini" (75 tons), carrying cotton worth 40,000 yuan, came to Shanghai and was detained by the Japanese naval authorities here this morning (26th) for allegedly carrying cotton out of the mainland to obtain Japanese "permission". It is found that the "Carini" is the seventh Axis ship detained by the Japanese naval authorities here in the past two months. The other six ships include four Italian ships and two German ships, all of which are now detained in front of the Japanese Navy "Water Police Station" near Shuizha in Nanshi. According to what was learned this morning, the "Carini" had just returned to Shanghai with cotton from various ports at the mouth of the Yangtze River and berthed on the Bund when Japanese sailors rushed to the "Carini" and ordered it to sail to the Japanese "police station". It is said that the cotton was obtained by a certain Chinese merchant in this city after obtaining the necessary bills of lading from the customs in advance.

### Unsettled Cases in the Second Special Court Are Being Discussed for Relief Measures; May Be Transferred to the First Special Court; Authorities of Courts at All Levels Are Negotiating

Since the two courts in the French Concession withdrew last month, all unsettled cases have been temporarily suspended. According to what the reporter of Ping Ming News Agency learned from the judicial circle yesterday, the Branch of the Supreme Court of the Ministry of Justice and the Second Branch of the High Court are working hard to find relief measures for the cases that citizens appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court before November 8 that have not been concluded, and for those who are not satisfied with the judgment of the Second Special Court and intend to appeal again. Judges at all levels who withdrew from the Second Special Zone have recently had discussions with the Branch of the Supreme Court and the Second Branch of the High Court. Specific measures may be formulated soon to transfer the unsettled cases of the two courts in the French Concession to the Public Concession Court for continued handling.

### Hong Kong Entry Ban Request for Extension

Later, the Hong Kong Immigration Department postponed it to the 14th of next month. According to news from the shipping industry, the shipping companies in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places are busy with the past year and merchants travel frequently. The Hong Kong authorities requested another postponement, but whether it will be approved is still unknown.

### The Exchange Equalization Fund Responds to Black Market Foreign Exchange According to Established Policies; Legitimate Trade Can Be Settled at Legal Prices; British and American Banks Have Refused to Swap

Shanghai's environment is special, such as customs revenue being intercepted, Japanese goods being imported into the occupied areas, black market foreign exchange speculation, and capital escaping from the mainland and concessions. The Chinese government cannot exercise its power in the concessions. Because it is not directly controlled by the government, it mostly engages in speculation in foreign exchange. If the government maintains the exchange rate as in the past, it will result in facilitating the importers of non-essential products and those who plunder legal tender from the occupied areas to obtain foreign exchange. Providing funds to importers of non-essential products is equivalent to helping capital escape, and facilitating those who obtain foreign exchange to make huge profits, which should not be done by the government. Now, the measures taken by the Management Committee of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund to maintain the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai are based on the established policies of the government.

Protect the Interests of Legitimate Merchants

It is necessary to restrict imported goods that are not necessary for resistance and construction, as well as goods manufactured in Japan. However, foreign trade is based on whether it is related to the needs of the life of the country and the nation. Therefore, legitimate Chinese and foreign merchants will be given various conveniences. Legitimate merchants only need to apply to the Foreign Exchange Payment Review Committee according to the foreign exchange application method, and they will be able to obtain foreign exchange at a price higher than the Shanghai black market. This is the method for the Chinese government to protect the interests of legitimate merchants and prevent them from suffering losses in the black market. The Chinese government still encourages the import of goods, but only limited to essential items.

Refuse Foreign Exchange Arbitrage Swaps

Although the Shanghai black market exchange rate has been maintained by the Management Committee of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund in cooperation with banks in friendly countries, it is actually to maintain the normal trade of various friendly countries in China. However, merchants in various friendly countries who need foreign exchange for legitimate trade must have supporting documents and purchase them from banks in various friendly countries. As for foreign exchange arbitrage and swaps, the foreign merchant banks association and the Chinese merchant banks association have long resolved to refuse them in unison, with the aim of preventing speculators from using their skills and stabilizing the black market foreign exchange for a long time. Now, British HSBC, McCallie, American Citibank and other banks, as well as various Chinese banks engaged in foreign exchange business, have complied.

### American Red Cross Medicines Distributed in the Mainland; Dr. Baker to Come to Shanghai Next Spring

After completing his official duties, he is scheduled to return to Hong Kong via Shao on the 30th of this month, spend the New Year in Hong Kong, and come to Shanghai in January next year.

The First Batch of Medicines to Arrive in China Next Spring

The first batch of medicines from the American Red Cross to relieve Chinese disaster victims, worth 350,000 yuan, has been transported to the Chinese mainland via the Yunnan-Burma Road after arriving in Yangon and handed over to Chinese relief agencies, Chinese hospitals, and American hospitals for use. A small amount of quinine is for relieving Shanghai refugees and has also been shipped to Shanghai by ship for distribution and relief. There is also a second batch of medicines that will be shipped to China in mid-January next year.

Wheat Transported to Occupied Areas for Relief

The 20,000 bags of rice and wheat shipped from the United States to Shanghai last month, in addition to the distribution of Shanghai has been completed, the rest of the relief to Changshu Su and other occupied areas, due to export procedures, has not yet been completed, has not yet been transported. Now that the export "rush certificate" and other documents have been completed, the Shanghai branch of the American Red Cross has scheduled to transport and distribute relief within days. The bulk of the relief to refugees in the occupied areas this time is wheat, while Shanghai is mostly rice.

### Unsold Goods Stored in Vietnam

After the authorities in French Vietnam ordered the interruption of the Yunnan-Vietnam traffic, they prepared to auction off the goods stored in Vietnam. According to news from the post office, more than 30,000 postal parcels accumulated in Haiphong and Hanoi were successively transported out of the tombs and transferred to the mainland after the General Post Office negotiated with the Vietnamese authorities in the autumn of this year. Only a small number are still stored in Vietnam. As to whether they will be auctioned off, no report has been received yet.

### Yesterday's Rice Market Implemented New Price Limits; Detectives Monitored Transactions; Brokers Were Refused Entry to Prevent Future Problems; Secret Transactions Outside the Market Were Rampant and Deserved Attention

The Shanghai Rice Price Committee issued an emergency public notice yesterday morning that the price limits for all fourteen types of foreign rice, as previously assessed, would be strictly enforced starting yesterday. Anyone found engaging in disobedience, exceeding price limits, or conducting private secret transactions would be severely punished as a warning to others. The fourteen price limits are as follows: Saigon No. 1, 87 yuan; Saigon No. 2, 81.5 yuan; Siam No. 2, 80 yuan; Best Fire Refined, 86 yuan; Small Refined, 79 yuan; Siam No. 1, 89 yuan; Saigon Annam Green Rice, 78 yuan; Saigon Mixed Broken No. 1 and 2, 76 yuan; High Tokyo Milled Rice, 79 yuan; Tokyo Brown Rice, 75 yuan.

The above prices are calculated per bag (i.e., Jardine Matheson original bag).

Detective Surveillance

In light of the past food crises, the concession authorities are deeply concerned about the current rice market inflation. To eliminate panic and prevent future problems, in addition to ordering rice merchants to purchase large quantities of foreign rice and transport it to Shanghai for regulation, and actively storing 200,000 bags of grain in public warehouses, they have also dispatched three or four detectives to the rice market yesterday to strictly monitor rice merchants' transactions in the market in order to crack down on illegal transactions in the rice market and to stop secret deals. Anyone found engaging in private secret transactions or exceeding price limits will be arrested and prosecuted according to law without leniency. On the first day yesterday, in addition to patrolling and monitoring transactions in the market, another person was assigned to the market registration to strictly check the market entry permits held by those entering the market.

Sale Registration

Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee, Public Notice No. 12, "Emergency Public Notice: This committee resolved at a meeting on the 24th of this month that in order to stabilize the rice market, starting from the 26th of this month, strict restrictions should be imposed on those entering the rice market to buy and sell. Except for members of the bean and rice industry, the miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, the rice shop industry, and the three public associations, anyone selling rice must first return to the market management committee for registration and approval before entering the market for sale. In addition to informing the market management committee to take note and handle this matter, this is hereby recorded and publicly announced for general information. Special announcement." According to the registration matters to be handled, the market management committee had previously handled this matter, and it is hoped that the committee can carry it out effectively.

Broker Actions

The Bean and Rice Broker Association, in order to persuade fellow traders to abide by the evaluation committee's resolution and temporarily suspend business in the market, convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday and issued Public Notice No. 27 yesterday, which stated, "We have received a letter from the Rice Evaluation Committee informing us that all members should temporarily suspend entering the rice market for two weeks, etc." The association held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday and resolved to advise all members to temporarily suspend buying and selling from today. The association will strive to negotiate with the committee and will issue another notice once the matter is resolved. Ruan Zhaogen, Zhang Zhaoliang, Wang Chunfang, Pan Huifu, Chen Xiaodi, and Zhang Qiuting have been appointed to investigate the association's affairs. All members are expected to comply.

Yesterday's Market Was Quiet

After the rice shop tea party market opened as usual at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, general rice brokers still held samples of rice and grains entrusted to them for sale and attempted to enter the market to act as intermediaries, but were refused entry by the gate guards, causing them to be stranded outside the market. However, these people's nature was hard to change, and they secretly peddled outside the market, which was indeed illegal. Although the market was still crowded with people, there was a situation where there was a market but no goods. Those buying and selling according to the price limit were still rarely heard. This was because the buyers still thought the evaluated price was too high, and there was very little profit if sold at the door. Conversely, the sellers still thought the evaluated price was too low and deliberately hoarded goods and refused to release them easily at reduced prices. Secret transactions outside the market were more numerous than in the market, which restrained the rice price and made it impossible to lower it.

Tax Exemption Extension

The Ministry of Finance issued a circular to customs offices in various places, stating, "The Ministry previously stipulated three measures for the tax-free import of foreign rice during the lean season of this year. The tax-free import of foreign rice was limited to the four months of May, June, July, and August, which has now expired. After investigation, it is found that the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, as well as all areas near the war zones and the rear coastal areas, are in urgent need of rice and grain relief. In order to facilitate merchants' purchase and import of foreign rice to enrich the people's food supply, it is specially stipulated that the tax-free import of foreign rice shall be as follows: (1) The purchase and transportation of foreign rice shall be exempt from import duties from November 1, 1940, to the end of October 1941. (2) The tax-free imported foreign rice shall be sold at a fair price by the Finance Department. (3) All funds for purchasing foreign rice shall be provided by the rice merchants themselves in foreign exchange."

### The Bridges on the Suzhou Creek Were Once Blocked; It Was Said That Important Japanese Figures Were Passing Through; Special Precautions Were Taken to Prevent Accidents

It was rumored that important Japanese figures were passing through the northern district of the Suzhou Creek, and special precautions had to be taken to prevent accidents.

### Overseas Chinese in Thailand Are a Force to Be Reckoned With; 4.5 Million People Are United; The Strength of Japanese Merchants Is Weak and Incomparable; The Sincere Words of the Head of the Japanese Sample Goods Team Visiting Thailand

The English-language Great American Evening News reported that Miyata, the head of the Japanese sample goods exhibition team currently visiting Thailand, wrote to a Tokyo newspaper, stating that the strength of Japanese merchants in Thailand is weak and insufficient to seize the commerce maintained by Chinese merchants there. There are a total of 52 Japanese merchant firms in Thailand, including the Mitsui and Mitsubishi branch offices, and the total number of Japanese residents is less than 700. Daily necessities in Thailand are quite cheap, and most of the goods are shipped from China. All of these goods are labeled as coming from Shanghai and Hong Kong. It is said that Chinese merchants in Thailand unanimously refuse to sell goods labeled "Made in Japan." It is also said that after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese merchants immediately boycotted all Japanese goods and even refused to talk to Japanese people, which is still the case today. There are currently 4.5 million overseas Chinese living in Thailand. They did not all come from their homeland in a large-scale colonization. Most of the Chinese merchants are descendants of Chinese who lived in Thailand one or two hundred years ago. All the villages and towns outside Bangkok are crowded with overseas Chinese. It can be said that there is no corner of Thailand without traces of overseas Chinese. The Japanese all live in Bangkok, so they cannot trade directly with the locals.

### Shen Daling Explains the Common Points of the Five Religions; Discusses How the Essential Meanings of Abstaining from Lust, Fighting, and Gain Agree

At the seventh lecture of the Five Religions Integration Society, Mr. Shen Daling spoke on the Three Abstentions as Common to the Five Religions, saying, "In the Jishi chapter of the Analects, Confucius said, 'The gentleman has three abstentions.' The three abstentions are lust, fighting, and gain. The Nirvana Sutra speaks of three diseases. The three diseases are greed, anger, and delusion. Greed is the same as greed for gain. Anger is the mechanism that triggers fighting. The word delusion probably refers to infatuation with lust. What Buddhism calls the three diseases is what Confucius calls the three abstentions. This is what Confucianism and Buddhism have in common."

Lao Tzu said, "Do not value the worthy, so that the people will not contend," which is also an abstinence from fighting, meaning abstaining from anger. "Do not value goods that are hard to obtain, so that the people will not steal," which is also an abstinence from gain and greed. "Do not show desirable things, so that the people's hearts will not be disturbed," which probably includes wealth and lust, and the meaning of abstaining from lust and delusion is especially clear. This is what Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism have in common.

In the Old Testament of Christianity, Moses twice declared the Ten Commandments, which include "You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not covet," etc. Murder is the result of fighting. Adultery, stealing, and coveting are lust, delusion, greed, and gain. This is also what Christianity has in common with Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism.

The Koran says, "Whether hidden or visible, restrain lust." It also says, "Do not shed blood, do not fight for land and expel people." It also abstains from fighting for others and abstains from greed for profit, which is the path to disaster. This is also what Islam has in common with Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianity. In the Analects, in youth, the blood and energy are not yet stable, so one abstains from lust. In adulthood, the blood and energy are vigorous, so one abstains from fighting. In old age, the blood and energy have declined, so one abstains from gain. Because of the difference in age and the change in blood and energy, one abstains at any time, which is very practical.

The Nirvana Sutra uses impure contemplation to treat greed, anger, and the contemplation of cause and condition to treat delusion, teaching people the way of self-cultivation, which is also very practical. In short, although the five religions have different detailed arguments regarding the three abstentions, they all teach people to avoid evil. After the lecture, the basic members' meeting was held. It is heard that in the next session on January 12, Mr. Shen Daling will still speak on the common points of the five religions.

### The Civilian Women and Children's Hospital's New Building Is Completed; Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday

The Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital at 995 Kang'nao Road in this city held its opening ceremony yesterday for its new location. Many well-known figures in the medical field attended the ceremony, and some signed on the spot to donate funds. The hospital was originally located on Weihaiwei Road. Since moving to the new location on Kang'nao Road in June of this year, the number of patients has increased dramatically, because the area around Kang'nao Road is full of factories and civilian residences, and the Civilian Women and Children's Hospital is designed for these civilians. The hospital was originally intended to serve refugees, but because the refugee problem in this city has improved, it has been changed to serve civilians and laborers. According to a report released by the hospital, from December of last year to June of this year, the hospital's activities have expanded from a purely maternity hospital to a formal hospital, including the training of medical personnel and clinical publicity, and a maternity training class has been established. Within these six months, the hospital has admitted a total of 629 patients. Although many patients have left the hospital, the service has always maintained a fairly high standard. The maternal mortality rate is only 0.74%, and the infant mortality rate is only 0.31%. The report also points out that the hospital is currently in need of a well-equipped operating room and a laboratory, as well as a car and an ambulance.

### Yu Songyun Appointed Director of Medical Administration

### Passengers Going to Nanyang Must Have Smallpox Vaccination Certificate

### Tragedy and Joy; Contradictions of Christmas Eve; Entertainment Venues Received Millions of Yuan; 82 Bodies Found on the Streets

Every Christmas Eve, Westerners and those who have been influenced by Western customs will celebrate and have fun. Although prices have soared and people's lives are exhausted this year, there are not a few who have become rich through hoarding and manipulation. Therefore, the grand occasion this evening is still as good as in previous years. It is heard that the seven top-notch dance halls in this city each had an income of 25,000 to 30,000 yuan from door tickets, dance tickets, and food, totaling 200,000 yuan. The thirty second- and third-class dance halls also had an average income of 10,000 yuan each, which is 300,000 yuan. In addition, the income from nightclubs, wine shops, and casinos is even more considerable. Therefore, it is estimated that the city consumed no less than one million yuan this evening, which is a staggering amount. However, only the rich can enjoy the night, but because the weather was suddenly cold that day, the poor people who were sleeping in the open groaned and screamed, and those who froze to death were even more numerous. According to the statistics of Pushan Villa, there were 23 adult bodies and 59 child bodies on the streets that evening, totaling 82 bodies. Even on Christmas Day, there were 32 adult bodies and 47 child bodies, totaling 79 bodies. The depth of the social contradictions in Shanghai can be seen from this.

### American and Italian Sailors Engaged in a Martial Arts Play in a Dance Hall; Approximately 25 People Were Injured on Both Sides; An Italian Officer Took the Blame and Apologized to the Americans

The English-language Great American Evening News reported that at 11:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve, a rare and extremely violent fight occurred in the Da'hu Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road between American Marines and sailors and Italian sailors, totaling about 100 people.

A Quarrel Started the Trouble, and Italian Soldiers Used Force

Then the American sailor returned, and the Italian sailor told four other Italian soldiers about the argument. The four Italian soldiers jumped up and beat the American sailor together. The rest of the Italian sailors in the dance hall also showed off their strength and bullied the few, joining the siege. At that time, 12 American Marines and two sailors saw this and rushed into the siege to help the American soldier who was being beaten. The order was in chaos for a while.

A Blonde Dancer Was Thrown Violently

Suddenly, a soldier grabbed a dancer with golden hair and threw her out violently, causing her to fall behind a bronze drum. A few minutes later, an American soldier grabbed the Italian soldier and slammed his head against the piano as revenge. When the mutual beatings were in full swing, an Italian non-commissioned officer suddenly drew a handgun, intending to stop the beating. However, before he could fire, he was hugged by an American sailor and pushed out of the dance hall, falling down the escalator.

### Correspondence

Regarding the matter, our client, Mr. Xu Hongsheng, stated that upon reading the Shen Bao newspaper of the 24th of this month, the news article "Xu Hongsheng Demands 300,000 in Bride Price from Zhang Benxing" contains sections that not only greatly deviate from the facts but are also deliberately fabricated. After investigating, on the 14th of this month, I learned that Zhang Changfa (also known as Zhang Benxing) was suspected of abduction after questioning when my daughter did not return home. While I was searching everywhere, a person named Hu Songquan suddenly came representing Zhang's father to propose marriage, using both soft persuasion and threats to the extreme. Although I explained that my daughter was already engaged, Mr. Hu insisted that if I stubbornly refused, I might never see my daughter again. To meet my daughter and understand the truth, I had no choice but to pretend to agree, but I stated that I must first meet my daughter and inquire about the truth before discussing further. Therefore, I instructed my wife to accompany them. When Mr. Hu led my wife to a room in the Yangtze Hotel, she found my daughter crying. Upon questioning, she learned that she had indeed been abducted and raped by Zhang Changfa. I then reported this to the Zhabei Police Station, who confirmed the facts and transferred the case to the police station for investigation and handling, where he is still being detained. Yet, the newspaper daringly wrote, "The daughter voluntarily promised herself to someone, the father demanded an exorbitant bride price, asking for as much as 300,000 yuan, and when negotiations failed, he turned him over to the police station," "Such intimidation is purely opportunistic extortion," and "It is said that the daughter has sincerely turned to Zhang, criticizing her father for insisting on obstructing the marriage of his children and demanding payment." These statements are truly shocking. The Yangtze Hotel room is owned by the Zhang family, and it was my wife who went to the Yangtze Hotel. I, myself, only reported to the Lao Zhabei Police Station after learning about it and did not go to the Yangtze Hotel beforehand. How could there be any truth to the story of gathering a crowd to catch the adulterer and taking him to the Yangtze Hotel to demand a bride price? Furthermore, how could there be any intimidation or extortion? As for my daughter sincerely turning to Zhang, there are confessions as evidence, so how can such reckless statements be tolerated? It is a deliberate fabrication. Moreover, the facts of this matter are clear and will be resolved in due course. It is especially inappropriate to mislead the public with alarming words and injure people with slanderous rumors beforehand. The intention is clear. The content published by the newspaper is a deliberate distortion of the truth by the contributor. To correct the misunderstanding, I have no choice but to ask you to publish a letter of correction. Your newspaper has always upheld accuracy in its reporting. I am writing this letter specifically to request that you make a correction. I would be most grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, Lawyers Wu Linkun and Du Xiaoxiang, December 26th.

### Three Robbers Hijack Yunfei Car Attempt to Kidnap Glass Factory Owner Factory Owner Not There, Robbers Return Empty-Handed Car Found on Route Ferguson, Avenue Petain

Yesterday morning around 8 a.m., Wang Taiyao, the owner of the Zhonghan Xinji Glass Factory on Route Hoche, Public Concession, was nearly kidnapped by robbers. The details of the case are as follows:

Three Robbers Hire Car, Driver Expelled

Yesterday morning at 8 a.m., the Jing’an Temple branch of the Yunfei Car Company suddenly received a phone call requesting a car be dispatched to the intersection of Route Dufour and Yongle Village in West Shanghai. The branch dispatched a local driver named Yang Shengquan, driving car number 12376, to the address. Upon arrival, three men got into the car and instructed the driver to go to Route Cassini, Caojiadu. When the car reached the entrance of a small tea garden there, the men suddenly revealed their fierce expressions, pulled out handguns, forced Yang Shengquan out of the car, and drove off at high speed.

Kidnapping Attempt Fails, Original Car Found

Unexpectedly, after the robbers seized the car, they joined two other robbers, totaling five people, and drove the car to the Zhonghan Xinji Glass Factory at 776 Route Hoche, where they stopped cautiously. They got out of the car one after another and rushed into the factory. Three of the robbers each held a handgun and barged into the accounting room, while the other two robbers stayed outside to guard the entrance. Two of the robbers asked if the factory owner, Mr. Wang, was present. The accountant, Mr. Jia, replied that he was not at the factory. The robbers left disappointed, got back into the car, and sped away. Around 9 a.m., the car was discovered at the intersection of Route Ferguson and Avenue Petain. The police ordered the car company to reclaim it. Since the robbers hijacked the car with the intention of kidnapping the factory owner, Wang Taiyao, Wang was summoned for questioning. The police are currently actively pursuing the perpetrators.

### Statistics on Education in Guangdong Province School Numbers Decrease, Student Numbers Increase

(Shaoguan, 25th Dispatch) Since the start of the War of Resistance, education in Guangdong Province has made considerable progress, and educational funding has also increased annually. According to statistics, there are currently 14,992 primary schools with a total of 985,912 students. Due to the expansion of the war zone, the number of schools has decreased by 829 compared to the previous year, but the number of students has increased by 14,402. There are currently 129 secondary schools with 98,165 students, a decrease of 4 schools and an increase of 1,070 students compared to the previous year. The number of schools this year has decreased slightly due to the impact of the war, but all schools have universally increased class sizes as much as possible to accommodate students withdrawing from the war zones. Educational funding in 1937 was 1,704,267 yuan, which increased to 2,206,853 yuan in 1939, and to 2,416,868 yuan this year.

### President Sa Bendong Talks About Recent Situation at Xiamen University Gradual Stabilization After Moving to Changting Plans to Establish College of Science and Engineering Next Year

(Guilin Airmail) Dr. Sa Bendong, president of National Xiamen University, went to Chongqing some time ago to report on his duties and seek instructions on school affairs. He has completed his public duties and flew to Guilin on the evening of the 13th of this month. Upon hearing the news, the reporter visited him and learned about the recent situation of the university as follows: "Our university currently has four colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, Law, and Commerce, with a total of thirteen departments and more than 600 students. Since Xiamen fell two years ago, we first moved to Gulangyu and then to our current location in Changting. Because we had prepared in advance, the loss of books, instruments, and general equipment was minimal. The environment in Changting is quite good and suitable for running a school. The cost of living is also low; students can live on 15 yuan a month. It is a pity that the funding is too little, ranking second to last among the national universities, only slightly more than Northeastern University. Since being converted to a national university, the annual funding has been more than 200,000 yuan. In 1940, including various temporary expenses, it was only about 400,000 yuan. Although the recurring expenses will increase next year, they will only be more than 270,000 yuan. What is currently gratifying is that the consistent good academic atmosphere has always been diligent and is even stronger than before the War of Resistance. Furthermore, all kinds of equipment, at least the minimum necessary, are sufficient for use, especially more than 120 kinds of Western magazines, which continue to arrive, providing reference and browsing. This is probably unmatched by any university in the interior. Another advantage is that the cost of living in the location is not high, so it is hoped that life can be easily maintained. As for the problem of recruiting outstanding professors, it was extremely difficult in the first two years, but it has been completely resolved this year, and it should be possible to fulfill this wish in the future. Fujian Provincial University has been ordered to close down this summer. The Provincial Government will independently manage the medical and agricultural colleges separately, while the law college will be merged into our university. After inspecting the various public and private colleges and universities in the province, there is still a lack of a college of engineering, and at present, our university only has an electrical engineering department. Therefore, I submitted a plan to the Ministry of Education to add a college of engineering during my trip to Chongqing, which has been approved by the Ministry of Education. It can be realized in 1941. Initially, it is planned to temporarily combine the college with the School of Science and call it the College of Science and Engineering. When the content is enriched and the grades increase in the future, it will develop independently."

### Second Reorganization Committee of Refugee Children's Home

(Dahua News Agency) Since the public election of directors Huang Yuzhai, Le Gengbao, He Wuliang, Gu Wensheng, Zhang Lianfang, Huang Zhaolin, and Zhu Daxun to organize the Reorganization Committee of the Refugee Children's Home in this city, all the progress and the content of the first resolution have been reported in various newspapers. It is now heard that the committee held its second resolution meeting on the 25th of this month at the Huizhong Entertainment Club. All members, initiator Sheng Zhiren, accounting advisor Li Wenjie of the Home, and General Director Pan were present. Chairman Huang Yuqi declared that the committee is engaged in all reorganization affairs of the difficult Home with a fair attitude. He is honored that Mr. Sheng and others came to participate and contribute their opinions. However, after investigating the resolutions of the previous meeting, after being sent to Director Yuan, they have all been implemented one by one. The reorganization work seems to have come to an end at this point. The colleagues of the committee all have fixed positions and cannot continue to engage in this work for a long time. The chairman intends to ask Director Yuan to convene a full board meeting immediately and publicly elect experienced and capable people to reside in the Home to take full responsibility. Then, General Director Pan reported on the handling of the resolutions of the Reorganization Committee, as ordered by Director Yuan: (1) The case of the Home receiving commissions on donations has been handled by the Reorganization Committee by sending a letter inviting accountants Xi Yushu and Wang Sifang, who have agreed to investigate the Home's accounts, and the truth will soon come to light. (2) The case of the Home's staff using funds privately without the approval of superiors is being handled in the same way as the first item. (3) The case of the Home's staff defaulting on accounts has been strictly ordered by the cashier's office to repay within a time limit. (4) The case of the Home's staff failing to work effectively has been submitted to the Reorganization Committee with a list of the Home's staff and servants, with additional evaluations (the original list is attached). (5) The case of the Home's staff receiving salaries but not working has been clarified at the previous meeting. (6) The case of the refugee children's band accepting monetary gifts has been absolutely prohibited. (7) The case of the refugee children's band insulting a female teacher has been strictly ordered to the teacher of the band, Su Yongnian, to properly teach and strictly restrain the refugee children in the future. The refugee children who caused the incident have also been severely punished according to the rules of the Home, and the female teachers have drafted a plan for all the refugee children to salute and apologize to their colleagues in the counseling office. (8) The case of the female teachers' disrespectful behavior towards the director has been sent by the counseling office of the Home to Director Yuan with a letter expressing their gratitude (the original letter is attached). As for the temporary motions, all the resolutions have been properly implemented one by one. It is heard that Chairman Huang has complied with the request of all the staff and students of the Home and intends to attend the anniversary week next Monday to give a speech. The Foya School at 37 Route Cardinal Mercier, Shanghai, has a long history and a high reputation in the field of deaf-mute education. The school performed a pantomime at the Ethnic Revival Day and Christmas Day celebration on the 25th, and also held an art exhibition, which was very grand.

In the second week of the Zilin Cup organized by the Shanghai Foreigners' Football Association, Youyou played against the Russian Emigrant Association at Jiaozhou Park yesterday. The two teams met in the league before, and Youyou unfortunately lost two to five. Meeting again yesterday, they were determined to avenge their loss. Youyou performed exceptionally well yesterday, winning four to zero and successfully entering the replay week. In another match, the Russian Army team played against the Austrians at the Luxembourg Field, and the Russian Army won two to one and also advanced to the replay week.

As soon as the central line kicked off, Youyou launched a fierce attack. Sun Damiao broke through on the left, but was blocked by the Russian team. Soon after, Sun Damiao used the same trick again, advancing to the baseline and crossing the ball to the center. Wang Caigao passed the ball to Sun Tuitui, who swept his right foot, and the ball went into the net, opening the scoring. This was less than twelve minutes after the kickoff. Soon after, Sun Tuitui again received Wang Caigao's assistance, shot the ball immediately, and the goalkeeper Dadachengu was unable to save it, and the ball flew into the net. Youyou scored two goals in fifteen minutes, and the offensive was great. After twenty-five minutes, Youyou Sun Damiao made a comeback, advanced quickly along the side, and passed the ball to Wang Caigao. Wang did not take credit for himself, but passed the ball to right forward Shen Jinda, who pulled up his foot and sent the ball into the net, making it three to zero. Youyou took the lead in the overall situation. Then Shen had another shooting opportunity, but unfortunately, it hit Dadachengu's hand. The first half ended, and Youyou took the lead with three to zero.

Duck Egg One

After the break, the two teams reorganized and fought again, but the Russian Emigrant Association still showed no improvement. Sun Damiao intercepted the opponent's ball and lightly passed it to Caigao, who dribbled it in. The goalkeeper Dadachengu fell to the ground to save the ball. Cao Qinfang failed to catch up. After two minutes, Sun Jinshun passed the ball to Wang Caigao, who stepped forward and shot, but the goalkeeper caught it in his arms, missing two good opportunities. Youyou's offensive did not slow down. After ten minutes of refining, Wang Zhangbao sent the ball to the front, Wang Caigao waited for the ball to come, and kicked it into the goal. The goalkeeper did not defend against it, and the ball was lost again, making it four to zero. The Russian Emigrant Association launched a counterattack, and the right winger Kechen shot alone, but Zheng Tongyu jumped up and caught the ball, turning danger into safety. Youyou launched another attack, and Cao Qinfang dribbled the ball to the enemy's territory. Shen Jinda kicked at the goal, but the goalkeeper knocked it out a short distance. Sun Tuitui stepped forward and kicked the ball high and away. After that, both sides had corner kick opportunities, but neither side scored. When the legal time ended, Youyou eliminated the Russian Emigrant Association with four to zero and entered the replay week.

### Current Situation of Shanghai YMCA Basketball

### Changes to This Year's Shanghai YMCA Basketball Rules (Liu Hesheng)

There are important changes to this year's Shanghai YMCA basketball rules, which are recorded as follows:

(1) Backboard: The backboard has been changed from a rectangle of 6 feet wide and 4 feet high to a fan shape of 54 inches wide and 35 inches high.

The rebound height should not exceed 54 inches at the highest and should not be lower than 49 inches at the lowest.

(3) Substitution: After scoring a goal on the field, a player may not be substituted immediately. (If a timeout is requested at this time, a substitution can still be made.) Before entering the field, after reporting to the recorder, the substitute player must stand outside the field and wait for the referee to call them before they can enter the field. Otherwise, it is a technical foul and a penalty shot must be awarded.

(4) Re-establishment of Lineup: Only when more than three substitute players from one team enter the field at the same time can a request be made to re-establish the lineup. Otherwise, the referee may not accept it.

(5) Numbers: The numbers on the jerseys must be at least 4 inches high on the front and at least 6 inches high on the back. The numbers must not be 1 or 2 and must start from 3 and go up accordingly, using single digits as a principle.

(6) Timeout: Each team may request five timeouts. During the fifth timeout, the recorder must notify the referee to inform the team's coach and captain.

(8) Penalty Shot: A. The team can request the referee to waive the right to the last penalty shot in a penalty shot or multiple penalty shots and throw the ball in from the center line.

B. When the referee places the ball on the free throw line during a penalty shot, the game starts (the timer starts the timer), so at this time, except for requesting a timeout and scoring the penalty shot, the player cannot be substituted.

(9) Forfeiture: If a team forfeits when the score is less than the opposing team, the record stands. If it is more than the opposing team, it is counted as 2-0, and the opposing team wins.

(10) Fouls: If the opposing team commits a personal foul against a player who is shooting, two penalty shots are awarded if the shot is missed, and one penalty shot is awarded if the shot is made. If the foul is pulling, intentional, or from behind, two penalty shots are also awarded.

### Food Prices Should, In Theory, Return To Calm But Secret Deals For Grade 2 Saigon Have Already Reached $89 If There Is No Speculation Or Manipulation The Market Should Return To Normal

The foreign rice market reopened yesterday after closing for a day to commemorate the Yunnan uprising. Because the authorities were concerned about the excessive rice prices, they ordered all brokers not to enter the market for two weeks to suppress rice prices, and dispatched personnel to strictly monitor the market. Brokers were invisibly prevented from entering the market, and both transactions and access were lacking. Moreover, those who had hoarded goods were adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The foreign rice that had exceeded the time limit for payment had no one to show samples. The market transactions, except for domestic rice, only included low-grade broken indica rice and foreign yuan rice and broken yuan rice. The transactions did not exceed a thousand bags, but in off-market deals, Grade 2 Saigon was already selling at 89 yuan. However, both public sentiment and the market showed signs of stabilizing, as market rumors were unfavorable to hoarding, and the shipment of foreign rice was coming to Shanghai as scheduled, which was enough to directly suppress rice prices. In the future, if there are no illegal disturbances by brokers and no illegal trading by speculators, the market should gradually stabilize, and the arrival of a large number of diverted goods is necessary to stabilize prices. Yesterday, the prices opened within the limit in the market were only 86 yuan for Zhongguan Dajiao, 78 yuan for Chongmi Cha, 76 yuan for Broken Tip, and 65 yuan for Juexia. As for other foreign rice, none were opened.

Domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica, are in a depressed state, and shippers are more willing to sell. At the same time, general speculators have no intention of buying more, resulting in a soft market. As a result, the opening prices have fallen slightly compared to before the holiday. Kunshan indica rice was seen at 102 yuan per dan, down to 98 yuan, and Qingjiao thin indica rice was seen at 92-3 yuan to 90 yuan, with original packs at 96-7 yuan.

The market for glutinous rice is also scarce, and it has fallen by a few yuan along with other goods. Yi Li white rice was 95 yuan, and Hong Kong white rice was 85-6 yuan, down to 83 yuan.

### Flour Market Trends Especially Firm Active Re-export Destination

Wheat Flour Yesterday's foreign flour market situation especially tended towards firmness. After falling once before the holiday, public sentiment remains firm, due to the fact that the supply from abroad is quite limited. When the supply of domestic flour is lacking, we can only rely on foreign flour. Therefore, the newly arrived batch of foreign flour has been held tightly by the firms and not released. Yesterday, the re-export destination for the Beiyang gang was quite active, with a total of 14,500 bags transacted. The Flower Bird Clock Tower brand opened at 22 yuan and 50 cents, and the Flower God brand at 22 yuan and 80 cents. The High Brand Wild Boar needs 23 yuan and 10 cents due to lively sales to local customers, and the market is still stable.

Wheat The market was as firm as usual yesterday, as the supply from domestic and foreign sources was quiet, and the goods in the concession warehouses were even more lacking. Therefore, sellers are hoarding goods, and the asking prices vary. Both Chinese and Japanese factories feel that the raw materials are insufficient, and ultimately regret that there are no goods to buy. Therefore, the market situation remains quiet and firm.

### Oil Market Oil Prices Rise Daily One Yuan A Catty

Yesterday's oil market saw few transactions due to the lack of a formal gold and foreign exchange market. Public sentiment was lacking in new stimuli, resulting in a lack of excitement. Soybean oil prices continued to revise the yuan price, and peanut oil stabilized, but the market tended to become active in the afternoon. As rumors spread that the gold price was rising sharply in off-market deals, public sentiment was shaken and the market improved. Qingdao raw oil alone saw a strong performance due to frequent increases in production prices. Sixty barrels of Qingdao raw oil were transacted in Shanghai, with prices ranging from 128 yuan to 27 yuan and 50 cents. Fifty barrels of new goods were priced at 130 yuan. Thirty pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were priced at 95 yuan, and fifty pieces of new goods were priced at 97 yuan. Five hundred tins of Yantai canned fresh oil were priced at 125 yuan. Fifty barrels of Dalian soybean oil were priced at 116 yuan and 50 cents, with 250 barrels for January delivery priced at 117 yuan to 115 yuan and 50 cents, and then back to 117 yuan. 300 barrels for January delivery were priced at 117 yuan and 70.5 cents to 117 yuan, and the closing price rose by half a yuan. 200 barrels for February delivery were priced at 119 yuan to 18 yuan, and 50 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil were priced at 94 yuan. Douzhuang raw oil has already sold for one yuan a catty. Soybean oil is one catty and one tael per yuan. One yuan per liter of rice, one yuan per catty of oil, and there is no good rice or good oil to eat. What a waste!

### Sugar Market Winter Mist Qing Up One Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat and weak, continuing to ease. The guild's clearing price for spot goods in the 24th group of white foreign warehouses was slightly lower at 79 yuan and 30 cents. Spot Dutch red was tight at first and then loosened, at 64 yuan and 30 cents to 64 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Mark did not trade the day before yesterday, but traded at 78 yuan and 50 cents yesterday, down two yuan from the 24th. CX Mark was 77 yuan and 20 cents, and DY Mark West Warehouse was 76 yuan and 50 cents, down one yuan, and the old goods in East Warehouse were 75 yuan and 50 cents. Winter Mist Qing continued to be available, priced at 61 yuan, up one yuan.

### Dried Goods from North and South Huizhou Honey Dates Sell Well Price Rises Another Ten Yuan

Huizhou honey dates have been in short supply recently, and the inventory in the market is also scarce, while the needs from various parties are still active. Therefore, the selling price continues to rise. Yesterday, the market price for Huizhou Gong Tutu was 260 yuan, up ten yuan from before, with the usual additions and subtractions for higher and lower grades.

### Miscellaneous Items Matches Step Up To High This Week Up More Than Forty Yuan Soap Market Also Sees Price Increases

The price of soap has been rising recently amidst the rising prices of various goods, causing the price to rise again. Currently, the market price of Guben soap is 23 yuan and 50 cents per box, Baixiangmao is 21 yuan and 60 cents, and Huangxiangmao soap is 17 yuan and 60 cents.

The price of matches has been rising frequently in recent days due to a lack of raw materials, and the factories cannot supply as much as they want, so production has been suspended, resulting in a direct increase in prices. Yesterday, the Beautiful brand sold for 360 yuan, Phoenix matches were 350 yuan, second-class miscellaneous brands were 325 yuan, and third-class miscellaneous brands were 310 yuan, up more than 40 yuan from last week.

### Medicinal Materials Medicine Euryale Ferox Low Yield, High Prices

The new crop of medicinal euryale ferox is relatively poor this year, so the source is extremely scarce. Therefore, the market price has been gradually rising after the new crop was seen. A batch was recently opened at a high of 85 yuan. In July, the price of old goods was less than 40 yuan, so the price has more than doubled compared to before.

### Dried Lily Bulbs Recover

The price of dried lily bulbs previously reached 50 yuan due to sluggish demand, but based on the cost, there must be a loss. Therefore, the arrival of goods has become rare, and the merchants are also watching and rarely releasing goods. As a result, the market has turned around and gradually recovered. The current market price has reached 65 yuan, up more than 15 yuan before and after, and labor is gradually increasing.

### Yarn Flowers Cotton Yarn Sees New High Prices, Reaching a Maximum of $1,425; Such Yarn Prices Will Also Affect the Cotton Market

The yarn market, which had retreated the day before yesterday, saw further advances today. This was due to the closing prices in the exchange turning higher, and the forward prices still exceeding the $1,300 level, with only a difference of over $100 from Shuang Ma (Double Horse) yarn. Therefore, bullish sentiment was quite strong, and actual sales were relatively active. However, some in the industry did not appreciate the rise of Shuang Ma yarn, considering it too expensive, and thus leaned towards a bearish stance. Some even sold off Shuang Ma yarn and bought cheaper brands. As for "foreign clients," they only bought Shuang Ma factory orders, showing no interest in other cotton yarns, indicating a vast difference in sentiment between the two sides. As a result, when the market peaked, so-called insiders rushed to sell, and when prices dipped, buyers scooped up vast quantities. By the afternoon, the yarn market had reached a new high again.

Shuang Ma opened in the morning, with short sellers quite active, as the foreign exchange and gold markets were closed, giving the market a deceptive appearance of inactivity. Although bids were low, trading was not vigorous. The opening price was $1,385, briefly falling to $1,382. However, "foreign clients" and Shengda (a large firm) continued to buy. Still, the overall mood remained scattered, hovering around $1,385-86 for quite some time. Then, as supply tightened, it rose to $1,394, a price that held steady for a while. Unexpectedly, after 11:30 AM, with few sellers on the floor, a bullish trend surged, breaking through the $1,400 level. At the same time, foreign business was still good, closing at $1,409. A mid-day trading tally showed 4,835 bales traded, with Shuang Ma 20s yarn rising by $25. The amount purchased by each group is listed below: Local firms: 4,650; Hong Kong: 260; Jiangxi: 10; Xiamen: 10; Ningbo: 5. Total: 4,835.

The yarn market was highly enthusiastic in the afternoon, with the bullish trend intensifying. The price of Shuang Ma 20s initially reached $1,422, driven by a sense of panic. It was said that bullish investors had resumed buying during the previous day's fatigue, leading to short covering. It later reached $1,415, marking a new peak.

The current cotton situation remains firm, but factory purchases are not strong. They are not buying at the current high prices and lack speculative interest, so the situation is not as exuberant as the yarn market. However, if yarn prices continue to rise, the cotton market cannot be viewed with complacency; it may just be a matter of time.

### Piece Goods Overcoating Fabric Remains Popular

Overcoating fabric maintained a lively trend yesterday, unaffected by the nearing end of the Gregorian calendar year. This is because market supplies are limited, with no local production, making future arrivals difficult. Costs are also rising, and buyers seem inclined to purchase only when needed. Customers tend to wait for extremely cold weather or for their old coats to become unusable before buying new ones, resulting in extended sales cycles compared to previous years. Transactions are mostly small and infrequent. Currently, black, gray, dark blue, and khaki overcoating fabrics, along with cashmeres, silver stripes, and patterned fabrics, are all in demand, creating a buoyant market with strong prices across the board.

Also, 24 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Rangoon today.

### Coal Indian Coal Soars

Indian bituminous coal, which had previously fallen to $233-234 per ton due to a certain foreign firm releasing a large quantity of 4,000 tons, filling the market with available stock, rebounded sharply after foreign exchange rates plummeted last week. All firms immediately ceased sales, and even the old warehouse orders disappeared, causing prices to soar. Indian lump coal is now quoted at $240 per ton, and run-of-mine coal at $235 per ton, delivered to customers, plus cartage. However, actual transactions are scarce, with little real market activity.

### White Coal Suspends Order-Taking; Black Market Prices Rise Again

Furnace-grade white coal has seen a significant decrease in sales over the past week due to the mild weather, resulting in a very quiet market for the local trade. However, managers and brokers, anticipating higher prices due to the continuous sharp decline in foreign exchange rates, have stopped taking orders and are holding onto their stock. They have also issued notices urging delivery, causing renewed anxiety after a period of stability. The black market has seized the opportunity to raise prices, with quotes increasing by nearly ten dollars per ton, with prices at door of $264 per ton, but this has not changed.

### Discussion on the Time Limit for Returned Checks

— Ying Yongyu

After reading Mr. Ji Runmo's "A Small Issue Regarding the Time Limit for Using Checks," I thought about the time limit for returning checks. The clearing of checks at Chinese banks generally takes place at the check exchange. Mr. Ji's comment refers to the current check exchange situation. It would be reasonable for returned checks among banking firms to be returned the same evening for mutual clearing. However, the return of checks among firms is still cleared on the same day. Before the war, the check exchange also stipulated that returned checks from banks be returned by 8:00 PM on the same evening, with each bank sending a representative to handle the return of checks. After the war, as many banks moved their operations to the western district, which was farther away, requiring more travel time, the exchange changed its policy, requiring that banks return checks to the exchange by 5:00 PM on the same day (no checks accepted after 5:00 PM) and by 10:00 AM the next morning. As a result of this change, checks returned to the bank that submitted them for exchange are generally received after 10:00 AM the next morning, sometimes as late as 11:00 AM. Checks from money shops and non-exchange banks are collected by the exchange each day, so returned checks are also returned the same day. However, the collecting bank usually receives them between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM the next morning. Checks from foreign banks (i.e., Bund banks) are collected by the exchange and then entrusted to the Bank of China for processing. The Bank of China also sends a representative to the exchange to manage the distribution. However, the deadline for collecting checks is still one hour earlier (10:00 AM on Saturdays and 11:00 AM on other days). The returned checks from the various foreign banks are gradually returned separately to the Bank of China on Avenue Joffre (now Huaihai Road), which then distributes them in batches to the exchange, which then returns them to the collecting banks. This process of multiple transfers makes the timing uncertain, sometimes as early as 10:00 AM, sometimes as late as 12:00 PM or 2:00 PM.

Currently, the return of checks among foreign banks is usually completed by 10:00 AM the next day. Chinese banks with accounts at foreign banks have until 12:00 PM on weekdays and 11:00 AM on Saturdays to collect checks. Returned checks are usually received by 11:00 AM the next day; checks received after that time are not accepted.

In short, there is no standard time limit for returning checks from foreign banks at the exchange, which needs to be improved. My suggestions are:

(1) If the exchange continues to entrust the Bank of China with processing foreign bank checks, it should agree on a return time with the Bank of China, so that the Bank of China can collect all returned checks from the foreign banks by 10:00 AM each day and send them to the exchange by car at 10:15 AM, with no checks accepted after that time. The exchange should then return them to the collecting banks by 11:00 AM.

(2) For simplicity, the exchange should no longer entrust the Bank of China and instead open accounts directly with the foreign banks.

The goal of the above is to ensure accurate and prompt check returns, which would also help resolve the issue of check usability on Saturdays when banks are closed in the afternoon.

### This Is Just Winter

— Yan Zhen

Mom was packing Dad's grass linen gown. The paper rustled. Mom glanced around. Dad was still reading the newspaper. Little brother was squatting on the ground looking at something. Mom took a scarf, tucked the paper package under her arm, glanced at older sister again, and went out.

Older sister cocked her head, her eyes turning to the ceiling. A large patch of yellowish water stains. She thought: Dad's workplace, ever since those cars came that day, Dad's been unemployed! It's been almost two months now. Dad says some of his colleagues are still doing fine, still working there. Whenever he mentions them, Dad gets angry! He often slaps the table and curses, "Damn them! Shameless bastards! I'd rather the whole family starve!"... Older brother is ambitious. He's going to the interior. He said, "This is just winter!"

"Older sister! Where did Mom go!" Little brother stood beside older sister at some point.

"Uh, Mom? Mom—Oh, Mom went to buy you something!" Older sister was suddenly stunned. She paused, then coaxed.

"Is Mom buying me fried eggs? Older sister!" Little brother loves fried eggs the most.

"Mmm!—" Older sister couldn't think of what to say, answering vaguely.

Little brother skipped away to play. Older sister picked up the sewing on the table, hearing Dad sigh heavily.

The door opened, cold wind rushing in. Older sister shivered, putting down the sewing in her hands. The thing to be altered for older brother was Dad's old cloth gown. Mom came back from the vegetable market. Carrying a bamboo basket, the faded scarf wrapped around her head had been pulled down to her nose. She came in, closing the door behind her. Little brother dropped his paper figure and rushed over, tugging at Mom:

"Mom! Did you buy me fried eggs?"

Mom didn't answer. She put down the basket, rubbed her hands, and first took off her scarf. Older sister saw Mom's shoulders hunched inside the worn padded jacket, her body trembling.

"What? Noodles again! Noodles every day! I don't want it! I want rice! I want fried eggs!" Little brother took off the newspaper covering the basket, and when he saw noodles, he started to cry.

"Good boy! Don't cry, don't cry. You want fried eggs, Mom will buy them tomorrow." Mom said softly, glancing at Dad.

Little brother cried. His body twisting and turning, banging against the wall.

"Good brother, don't cry. Mom forgot today, she'll definitely buy them for you tomorrow." Older sister picked up little brother, using the corner of her clothes to wipe the tears on his face.

Dad, sitting in the corner, flung the Shen Bao newspaper on the table, sighing heavily.

Dark clouds gathered thickly, the sky tightly drawn, the north wind howling wildly. It was going to snow! On the glass window of the house opposite, the red light of a fire flickered, bending and curving upwards, and smoke curled from the chimney extending outside the wall.

Older brother said, "This is just winter!" Older sister thought, unconsciously holding little brother in her arms a little tighter.

### A Prediction

— Shui Rong

New Year's "red market" prices on the market are high: Clams cost over 7,000, American dollars are at 500, yarn flowers and food have all surged. New high prices will emerge one after another. Clams are only a little short of 10,000. To match the custom of "ten thousand gold".

A certain celebrity gave a speech encouraging group rice purchases and repeatedly declared his "selfless" intentions. The letter was thousands of words long, extremely "sincere". The next day, rice prices rose again sharply. The authorities had no choice but to reinstate "price controls". It snowed heavily that day, and many poor people fought to fill their hunger with snow.

The administrators of ×× and other educational institutions jointly hosted people from all walks of life in order to "express their sincerity". During the dinner, they declared: "If there is any malpractice, they will surely be struck by lightning and burned. If there is any lying, they will die and have their tongues cut out in hell." Everyone present was moved.

The authorities, citing excessive "exports", have again levied "additional taxes". Big landlords and sub-landlords are eager to raise rents. The third landlord had no recourse and appealed to the "Housing Dispute Arbitration Committee". After registration and investigation, the verdict was: "In times of crisis, we should all be in the same boat. The landlords' difficulties are also beyond their control." The authorities then issued a notice strictly prohibiting large landlords and sub-landlords from illegally raising rents.

Public buses and trams have increased fares again, but the number of passengers has decreased sharply. The number of people "walking" has increased sharply on the streets, causing congestion.

### Suppressing Rice Prices and Punishing "Rice Profiteers"

— Qian Jiong

Former Chengdu Mayor Yang Quanyu was sentenced to death by the military court for hoarding food. This is how treacherous merchants are dealt with in the provisional capital (Chongqing), and from that brief telegram, we can draw three points: First, manipulating food and disrupting public order not only hinders national policy but also helps the enemy. Second, the criminal was sentenced to death for hoarding only "several hundred piculs" of wheat, while our "hoarding experts" in Shanghai, who hoard no less than tens of thousands of bags of rice, are still at large. Third, the goods purchased by the traitor have already been called "stolen goods", but the Shanghai traitorous merchants openly put the stolen goods in the warehouse and are free and at ease, smug. In this short telegram, we feel that the law and order of "here and now" is so far apart from the strict military law of "then and there" that we can't help but exclaim that the Chinese people in Shanghai are so unconscionable, disregarding the nation and the state, and put their personal "wealth and glory" in the first place?

However, we are not saying that we will let them exploit us and be "helpless". Our 4.5 million citizens of Shanghai have the need to demand "survival", and we feel that there are two good ways to do this:

First, the so-called "rice profiteers" in Shanghai can also be judged by law.

Second, all the rice stored in the warehouses in Shanghai should be taken out and sold publicly at the purchase price.

Of the above two methods, the first one is more difficult to "implement" because they have the root of power; but the second method is still an effective sanction, as long as we all demand it unanimously, the local authorities will further strictly sanction the treacherous merchants and implement public sales of stored grain, and we believe it can be implemented quickly, not to mention that this method is also of great help to maintaining public order itself!

### Ambidextrous

— Written by Ma Ge

### Zhangtai Willow

— Gu Mingdao

Liu Rushi gently closed the door, forcing a smile, and said to Muzhai: "It's good for me to die on the bed with you. In life, we shall ask about the quilt; in death, we shall ask about the tomb, so that you won't be lonely under the springs." Muzhai also said: "When a person hangs themselves, the tongue must stretch out, which is also very uncomfortable. I remembered that there is a pond in the back garden, why not throw myself into the clear stream to show the loftiness of my integrity." Seeing that Muzhai did not like this and did not like that, Rushi was very unhappy. Then he said: "Since you have decided to die for integrity, drinking poison is good, hanging yourself is good, throwing yourself into the pond is good. Let's go to throw ourselves into the pond." Then he ordered the servants to set up an incense table in the hall, and accompanied Muzhai to burn incense and kowtow, worship the ancestors, and worship the late emperor, and then calmly die for integrity. After a while, the servant came to report that the table had been set up, please go downstairs to kneel down and worship. Liu Rushi then walked to Muzhai, took his hand to help him, and said: "Go to justice calmly, return my innocence, today is the day we become benevolent, please don't hesitate again." Qian Muzhai said: "It's just that I still have one thing unfinished." Liu Rushi was stunned and said: "What do you have to do?" Muzhai said: "I have written so many poems and essays in my life, I have proofread and sorted out a large part with you before, and there are still new works that have not been added. After my death, my descendants can print and publish them to leave them to the world. So-called, a horse dies and leaves bones, a person dies and leaves a name. It's a pity that some things have not been done yet, it's best to get it done, then my heart will be at ease." As soon as Liu Rushi heard this, he busy said, "Oh! What time is it, and you still have the heart to sort out your works? Truly valuable articles are like gold and stone, although they are temporarily buried, their brilliance will never be obscured, and someone will always discover and spread them. Su Dongpo once wrote a preface for Su Shunqin, and it was discussed like this, and what's more, the article is spread by people. If you die for your country and become famous, your great name will remain in the universe, are you still afraid that these articles will not be passed on to the world? Why bother overthinking this? Otherwise, why are the articles of Qin Hui and Yan Song not valued by the world, but spread among the people? Now that you have decided to die, you should not forget this matter. A few days ago, I heard someone say that a scholar in a certain place also agreed to die together because he did not want to be a slave to others. On that day, the scholar went to invite his friend to die together, but his friend said that many pigs in the pigsty behind had not been fed, and he was afraid that they would starve to death and could not make money, so he asked the scholar to wait a while for him to feed the pigs, and then go to die together. When the scholar heard his friend say this, he knew that his friend could not die, and immediately flicked his sleeves and left. Don't be angry, if you still want to be obsessed with your poetry collection today, then how is it different from the scholar feeding pigs? When Liu Rushi said this, her brows were tightly locked, and she looked even more unhappy. (22)

### Review of "Confucius"

— Xu Daming

I must acknowledge that Mr. Fei Mu's directing technique is outstanding. In the past, we already appreciated his style in "Eternal Love" - the portrayal of characters' personalities, the creation of surrounding atmosphere to help the development of the story, and the use of "close-ups" to capture the center of each segment. Today, in "Confucius," apart from the "close-up" scenes not being significantly developed, the portrayal of the main characters and the creation of the atmosphere here have achieved great success. The opening scene of rescuing the poor with rice and "borrowing" rice from others with the cut firewood to feed them is quite touching. In front of this story, there is also the contrasting image of Yang Huo and Shao Zhengmao's cruelty - joking with the dead man hanging high as a "target" - which brings out how the "treacherous officials" were frantically slaughtering the people, and who were the ones who rescued the people. But we regret that Mr. Fei Mu neglected a more important aspect - the great mass scenes - the people's affection and support for those people; the people's deep hatred for those people and the emotions of wanting to kill them, we did not see this here.

As for the director's handling of the actors, first of all, we agree with Mr. Fei Mu's excellent approach of breaking the "star system." In "Confucius," we did not see anyone's role being particularly heavy, even Tang Huaiqiu, who played Confucius, was less emphasized than Zhang Yi's Zilu in many occasions. Of course, the deliberate reduction of Confucius's scenes may also have other reasons (fearing that people would deliberately promote "Confucianism," etc.). We believe that Zilu's prominence is because the director wants to use Zilu to inspire the audience's fighting spirit. This intention is quite good. As far as the harvest is concerned, the effect is not bad.

Secondly, in the director's handling of the overall flow of the play, we saw Mr. Fei Mu's painstaking efforts - giving people room for "thinking" everywhere. Whether it is the resolution after "depriving food between Chen and Cai" and the connection between the beginning and the end of traveling around the countries, there is a section of "process" left for the audience to "figure out" and "search." But there is one thing worth noting here, that is, it is difficult for the general audience with a lower level and unfamiliar with historical facts to understand, so this is worthy of discussion on the road of generalization and popularization. I would like to ask Mr. Fei what he thinks?

### Regarding the Actors

Here, I can only talk about the main actors: The most successful actors, in my opinion, are Zhang Yi who plays Zilu and Xu Li who plays Yang Huo. They have quite excellent achievements in the portrayal of personality and the control of the play. The next are Yan Hui (Sima Yangcai), Confucius (Tang Huaiqiu), and Zigong (Pei Chong). Generally speaking, their acting skills are still above the average level. However, one point is worth pointing out, that is, in this film, there are many actors who are new forces. It cannot be said that this is the correct policy of the Minhua Company, because on the one hand, it can create a movement to promote newcomers and break the clumsy means of creating a few "stars," and on the other hand, in the current situation where the "isolated island" lacks acting talents, it is indeed a good trend. I hope this can also affect other film companies and promote more outstanding new talents in the "isolated island" film industry!

I am very happy to see the advent of this giant film, and at the same time, I hope that the Minhua authorities can develop forward more correctly based on this purpose. This is the expectation of each of our audiences, and it is also a sincere opinion contributed to the readers. I hereby introduce this film to the readers!

### Talking About Confucius

— Die Ye

The movie "Confucius" was shown at the Golden Gate (theater). I considered it vulgar and redundant and was unable to go, so I sent my son, Keyan, to watch it. When Keyan came back, I asked: "What are your impressions of 'Confucius'?"

"Father, I don't understand why they wanted to make 'Confucius'?" he said.

"Then how do you feel about Errol Flynn's Robin Hood?"

"That can't be compared. Robin Hood is just a robber!" he said.

"How about 'Empress of a Generation'?"

"That can't be compared either. She's just a prostitute!"

"How about Edison?"

"Compare...no, Confucius opposed using tricks to disturb the world," he said after a while.

"How about 'The Birth of Jesus'?"

"It can be compared,...but it can't be compared either. It seems that this film is more profound than 'The Birth of Jesus'," he said doubtfully.

"That's right. The greatness and significance of our film industry making 'Confucius' lies here. First: In the time of Confucius, there were countless bandits like Robin Hood, and those who 'used literature to play with the law' were people like Shao Zhengmao; those who 'used chivalry to violate the ban' were people like Yang Hu and Zhi Dao; 'flattery like Zhu Tuo' and having a child were like Nanzi. In European and American films, they are all strongly rendered. Edison can be considered a scientist of the generation. Without Edison, we would still be in the dark tonight; he gave us the enjoyment of our senses and advanced material civilization, but Confucius's development and contribution to mankind are on the other hand; in the society of the Spring and Autumn Period, some places are not much different from today's society. Mencius said: 'Fighting for land to fight, killing people to fill the field, fighting for cities to fight, killing people to fill the city.' Confucius came out to make a cry for justice. In the middle of the flow, he turned the tide, and his merits cannot be obliterated for all generations. In the era of killing and plundering in the Spring and Autumn Period, only Confucius was 'abandoning war', he did not speak of strange powers and disorderly gods. Although Confucius had three thousand disciples and seventy-two disciples, he was just like Jesus, working hard for a lifetime and not succeeding in one thing. But his great spirit, the five constant doctrines of 'benevolence, righteousness, etiquette, wisdom, and trust,' have enveloped everything in the world; later intelligent emperors used him to replace guns and cannons, so that the people were completely immersed in the shell of 'benevolence, righteousness, body wisdom, and trust,' and let him be the despotic devil alone; everyone was not allowed to betray etiquette, but he alone was allowed to be the master of all licentiousness, killing, aggression. Therefore, from the death of Confucius to the present, his reputation has been wrongly submerged for two thousand years. Now what you know is just the clay model of Confucius in the Hall of the Great Accomplishment and Sacred Teacher, and you have not seen the true, soulful, and true Confucius, just like the Westerners use Jesus. Jesus saves me, how can Jesus easily forgive all the sins of the people in this way?"

Keyan suddenly... "Ah! The reason why we want to perform 'Confucius' is this."

### Song Ya-haini's Powerful Rival

— Yong

Song Ya-haini and Erna Andersen, one is familiar to us all, having reigned for several years as the "Ice Skating Queen" on the silver screen of Hollywood. The other is still unfamiliar, having only recently arrived in the United States and preparing to compete with Song Ya. They are both from Norway and studied ice skating techniques under the same teacher, so they are old classmates. Looking back, it is worth mentioning that in their hometown, Song Ya always defeated Erna to win the championship in four skating competitions. However, Erna was also highly regarded by her teacher. Erna herself admitted: "Song Ya practices harder than I do. Whether it rains or snows, she still practices outdoors continuously, while I rest indoors." Perhaps this is the reason for Erna's repeated failures!

Before setting off for the New World, Erna Andersen toured various European countries with her own theater group, receiving great acclaim. After arriving in the United States, she participated in the International Ice Dance event in New York, and her fame immediately spread. In addition to being skilled in ice skating, she is also proficient in skiing.

Erna is ambitious, hoping on the one hand to compete with Song Ya in the American film industry and no longer follow the old path of the past, and on the other hand, she also wants to introduce her new skiing skills to the film industry. She plans to realize these two points this winter.

### From Hollywood

— Bao Lin

As American patriotism flourishes, the Hollywood film industry is also leaning towards producing a large number of patriotic films depicting the Navy, Army, and Air Force. A recently announced film is "Ten Men from the West," starring Tailuo Baohua.

One thing that proves that the Hollywood film industry is expanding its market to Latin America is that MGM has decided to make a film based on the deeds of the famous Mexican historical hero Zapata. The film is titled "Viva Zapata!" and stars the big star Robert Taylor. The original author of the book is the writer of "Long Live Freedom." (Note: "Long Live Freedom" is the famous work of Juarez Pires.)

David Niven is serving in the Royal Air Force in England. According to news from England, he has married the daughter of an officer in his unit. David Niven has narrowly escaped bombing several times.

Betty Davis shook hands and made peace with her divorced ex-husband, Harmon Nelson, in a cafe in New York. Therefore, rumors say that they may reconcile.

### "No One Shall Pass"

The Chinese Cartoon Society will print 150,000 copies of the chorus song "No One Shall Pass" from its first work and distribute them widely to all sectors of society. Those who want to obtain the musical score can send a letter to the Chinese Cartoon Society at No. 38, Lane 201, Luba Road, and it will be sent to you. Also, groups requesting the score must specify the number of people.

### John Barrymore on Women

— Si Hua

Dorothy Dorothy Coasts

Di Luo was my first wife. I selected her from the top candidates in the screen actor exam – this is not to tell others to do the same, because it is dangerous – but for me personally, it has had satisfactory results. When I first saw her on the screen, I thought she was the woman of my dreams. In fact, she was exactly as I dreamed her to be – this is what I experienced during the seven years we lived together.

Ailan Pa Lai She often bothered me with inquiries about Shakespeare. She initially came to visit about her university diploma, and we have not been estranged since, although we met by chance.

Garbo She is extraordinary. When we co-starred in "Grand Hotel," she gave up her regular lunch time and switched seats with me so that Kai Mala could face my left side. She ordered the producer, Arthur Brisbane, to leave – not knowing it was him. When I told her about it, she said, "Let's each have a drink!"

Fei Kang Pu Deng She is a British actress, one of the loveliest women. When my "Hamlet" was performed in London, she played Ophelia. Once, she drank too much and made a mistake, and I couldn't help but say to her, "Do it again!" So she broke up with me.

Daughter Diana She is a very beautiful girl. We had been separated for many years and only recently met. We were speechless. I finally said, "Shall we have a drink?" She replied very well: "I think we both need it, Dad!" Diana L is mature, beautiful and sensible.

Katherine Hepburn Among many actresses, she is one of the most outstanding. You see star-studded male actors overshadowing famous female stars, but Miss Hepburn always stands at the highest position on stage. She never makes a mistake on camera. She is indeed an excellent actor. This quality alone is enough to make me admire her immensely.

Baolian Gaodai She knows how to maintain a woman's beauty. I am not at all surprised that she has won the favor of the generation artist Chaplin. Once, I went to visit them, and we had a pleasant time all night long, until dawn I realized that they were all being played by her. She can be said to be an outstanding among women with magical power. (Excerpt from Look Magazine)
